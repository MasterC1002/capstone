1372053304.0,1gybxp,I just had an unusual breastfeeding experience... I nursed my cousin's baby. Anybody else ever nursed a baby that wasn't yours?,BanditTheFox,218,35,80,"So, they'd given him formula

As soon as I got there, the baby woke up, and started rooting and fussing, and squirming and whining, and she had been gone for five minutes. I knew he was about to get PISSED and then it'd be even harder to calm him down enough to nurse, especially under the circumstances. I joked to my aunt that if my cousin didn't get back soon, I was going to stick a boob in his mouth, ""if you still had milk

So, pulled up my tshirt, and stuck a boob in his mouth. He latched perfect, and just gulped and gulped. Now, IN this room were: my sister, her five year old daughter, my one year old daughter, her two teenage girls, she was totally cool with it. 

My reasoning was that if we curbed his appetite a little bit, we handed him off to be burped and I started helping my cousin figure out if any milk was coming out or not--- they'd been trying all day and hadn't seen any. Now, me and my cousin have NEVER had this kind of relationship, we see each other maybe five times a year at the kid's birthdays, or Thanksgiving. We occasionally text, but we aren't super close. And here I am, standing behind her, showing her how to milk herself

Before I left, just in case they got bad again. 

It was a surreal experience


I was a really odd, haha. Anybody else have any ""wet nurse/ teaching someone else to breastfeed"" stories?

***EDIT: I went to see her again today, but the baby was eating like a champ! She told me she really wants to do this, and she's not going to let anything get in her way.

Had a baby.  Woo!  Breastfeeding?  Of course!  Why

Four days after I had a baby, it was immediately obvious.  Maybe it's because I'm an educated mother of today, or maybe it's because I got The Mastitis of Doom.  Either way, ten minutes after waking up and knowing I had a boob infection, I started to get the shakes.  Severe, can't-hold-a-phone-to-my-ear, shakes.  No temperature yet.  But that changed fast.  I went from 98.1F to 104.7F in 45 minutes.

I called the hospital's off-hour nurse line, and switched to merely shivering.

When we left home, so that when the breastfeeding nurses took it I was at 101, and when I finally got into the nurse practitioner, it was only 99.  At this, she mentioned that maybe I could just “tough it out” without antibiotics, and seemed to disbelieve that my temp had been so high only a few hours ago.  Until she saw my breast.
  
“Oh my god.”

Those were her words.  There was no more talk of toughing it out.  She prescribed particularly vigorous antibiotics and had the lab do a white blood cell count to make sure I didn't need to be hospitalized.  And after one more look at my breast

My husband had to work, and I was determined to nurse through it.  My mother had been chatting with her friends, and had all sorts of “I had mastitis, it was horrible, but I persevered.” stories to relate to me.  On the way back I had to pull over and rest twice; bright spots started to flash in front of me.  I made it to my parents' to pick up the baby and didn't get any farther.  I was just going to take a short nap, just until I stopped being so dizzy.  I don't remember much after that.  

My mom said I kept telling her my head hurt, he carried me out to the car and they drove me down.  When we got there, the EMT's took one look at me and chastised my parents for not calling the ambulance; I was in shock.

I started to remember things after I was in the emergency room.  I told the doctor I had mastitis.  He asked if I had an epidural
“Worst headache of your life?”
Yes.  Easily.
There's no way that this is just mastitis

It wasn't meningitis.  It was just mastitis.  Just mastitis.  I was in the hospital for four days.  I didn't see my newborn daughter for four days.  I couldn't sit up in bed without vomiting.  I couldn't get up to go to the bathroom without passing out.  But I pumped.  It was miserable and incredibly painful

After I got home, or rather my husband would hold her and I would lie there sobbing.  But, at eight days old, she had been fed with a bottle for the latter half of her waking life.  After two sucks she would just scream.  Every day, twice a day, for four weeks we tried to get her to nurse.  We went to lactation consultants and maternity nurses who would do exactly what I had been doing, and would fail to get her to nurse

And they would tsk tsk me and say “Babies drain the breast better than the pump.”  Like that would somehow convince my daughter to suck.  Like it was my fault.  After a month of failure

But I pumped.  And damn, every day.  That's over half a gallon a day.  When my lactation consultant heard my schedule, she told me to dial it back a bit.  The doctors and nurses at the hospital were very adamant about me pumping every two hours at a minimum; they never told me to cut back after the infection cleared.

Dial it back I did

Like the first time, vomited, and pissed myself.  Cue memory loss.

This time I wound up in the ICU.  Otherwise it was all pretty much the same.  Exactly the same

Quick recap: bum milk duct = mastitis = sepsis = death.

Now comes the moral of the story.  What did I learn?

The most interesting, more the challenges that come with it.  This, surprisingly, was perpetuated most strongly by the medical staff.  An ICU nurse asked me what I was in for as she was taking my vitals.  When I said mastitis, she perked up.  “Oh!  I had that.  It's absolutely awful.  Of course, back when I had it they wouldn't let you in the hospital for it, you just had to nurse through it.”  *In the ICU.*  She had just told me that my blood pressure was 80/44, implied that my reason for being there wasn't legitimate.  I experienced that same reaction (though none nearly as overt) from one of every two nurses.  Gosh it sure is horrible that you have mastitis, etc.  But the execution was really horrible.  It mostly came across as trivializing a very serious situation.  

It wasn't until my doctor explained exactly how deathly ill I had been that I began to realize I had felt like a faker.  Like I wasn't really sick enough to be in the hospital, I can understand why.  Maybe this is a common phenomenon with most illnesses; I wouldn't know, I've never been hospitalized before, but I can't help feeling like it's got a lot to do with how our society deals with breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding in our culture is at a weird and kind of awful place.  It's ruthlessly promoted as being the only option for a decent mother.  And I don't mean ruthlessly promoted by the medical sector.  Ninety percent of the medical employees who worked with me were understanding and respectful of my choices.  

The ruthless promoters are the bystanders.  People in the grocery store will see me with my baby and ask if I'm breastfeeding.  When I answer in the negative

On the flip side, which employs several people whose sole job is to help women breastfeed, had no place to pump.*  Mixed messages, is what I'm getting.  And I never had the opportunity to get dirty looks by breastfeeding in public.

Lastly, and my husband looked at me like I was crazy.
“What are you talking about?  You're not going to breastfeed again.”
“Why wouldn't I?”
“You almost died.  Twice.” 
“But... Babies: smarter.  Healthier.”
“...You almost died.  Twice.”

I almost died.  Twice.  And yet I didn't even entertain the thought of not breastfeeding until he brought it up.  That's not getting back on the horse

1359836390.0,17rolj,Pediatrician said my baby(18mo) would be in the hospital if he wasn't still breastfeeding.,hydrogenbound,101,12,24,"So 10 or so days ago I post about how I was underweight and everone was pressuring me to quit breastfeeding. You all really encouraged me to keep on and improve my calorie intake and it has probably saved my sons life. 
Last Friday he came down with a monster cold and cough. He stopped eating all solids on Friday. On Monday morning he started vomiting every 15 minutes and had bad diarrhea and was diagnosed with norovirus. He has been on Zofran since Tuesday which has helped the vomiting, nothing. He is SO SICK. It is heartbreaking. He's already lost 5 lbs.

Of course I have been on constant contact with his pediatrician and she told me last night he would have been hospitalized for sure if he wasn't still breastfeeding.  

I had forgotten that this was one of the reasons to keep breastfeeding. I read an article or blog once when I was pregnant about a mom who was able to breastfeed her daughter through her daughters chemo treatments when she was three and I filed it away under really important reasons to do extended breastfeeding and then somehow forgot when everyone was pressuring me to quit over the last 18 months. 

I have made it a point when talking to everyone now to say that the doctor said it is very good he's getting breastmilk. FEELS GOOD!

I just wanted to share this awesome breastfeeding experience and to thank everyone here for their continued support. I would never have had the courage to breastfeed in public if it wasn't for you guys here... actually I probably wouldn't even be breastfeeding anymore.

Yesterday when I told my manager I needed to pump he told me I couldn't do it in the office (the only clean private place in the restaurant, I told him they had been all week and if he needed to call the gm he could. Then today he told me I needed to sanitize everything before leaving the office (I do anyway, I don't need to be told to keep my stuff clean), this was in front of about 5 other servers, when all I had said was ""I need to use the office"", so I thought that was pretty rude of him.

* It never ends! He nurses vigorously for 5-7 minutes and then more or less pacifies for the next 30-60 minutes. The minute I take my nipple out he screams and we repeat. Now

* Not everyone has engorgement when their milk comes in. I freaked out thinking I was gonna have issues cause my boobs never felt different. He's still alive so I'm gonna assume my milk came in ;)

* Not everyone LIKES to breast feed. I thought it was going to be this whimsical, and that's what I want more than I want my boobs back.

The premise was that ""really cool"" new neighbors move in next to the Simpsons, go on midnight bike rides and their son's birthday party is at an old slaughterhouse. On of the things that makes them ""cool"" is that the mother breastfeeds. 

Marge bottle feeds Maggie and feels incredibly pressured by this new woman. During a ""breastfeeding circle"", 'If YOU won't breastfeed your baby, WE WILL.' Later in the episode, Marge's stockpile of formula saves the town by putting out a fire. 

I was so saddened by this view of breastfeeding: mothers pressuring/guilting other mothers

BUT, ""You know, I do feel kind of guilty for not breastfeeding the kids. Except Lisa. I breastfed Lisa for 9 months."" Then the scene shows Bart watching TV, Lisa reading a book, and Maggie looking through the window at Lisa longingly with a sad look on her face. 

And that was it. There was no joke about it. Just this oddly quiet moment when the Simpsons seemed to say

It was a strange, but I was relieved to see that they didn't end the episode on this whole Breastfeeding Women are Obsessive Sanctimommies and Formula Feeding Moms are Relatable, Down To Earth Women.

However

The reason I made this decision is very simple: I am diagnosed bipolar. I made the educated decision to stop my meds when I found out I was pregnant and for the most part it worked ok with careful mood monitoring. I had planned to continue on this path once DS was here since the medications that work to treat my disorder are most definitely not safe for breastfed babies. 

I underestimated how much your hormones change once baby is here, it's probably baby blues. But the problem with me is that something that small can trigger a big downward spiral. My husband and I talked about it at length, and we've decided we're not willing to take the chance of it going much further. It takes too long to titrate up and balance out, and my husband goes back to work full time on Monday. 

So moving forward my baby, I do feel guilt at having to do this. But I want to be the best mommy I can be, the mommy he deserves, and that's not the mommy I've become, and if I continue down this path, I am headed for some serious issues that could potentially harm my baby. It's not worth it in my mind. 



I don't know why I wrote this, and I am so envious of the bonds you are able to have with your children through bfing. Keep it up ladies, you are all unbelievable. Thank you.

I did what the pediatrician said for one night

Had to take yesterday off because I got pink eye somehow (Bella doesn't have it so I am curious as to where I got it!)

I had decided to take her into daycare early so that I could feed her and maybe see if she didn't want to eat there. So we arrived at daycare around 9:30 and they started warming up a bag of milk. I bounced her and played with her a little while it was heating up. We did warm it up a little warmer than they normally do (they said a lot of the babies like it a little warmer than normal). And I sat down with her the same way I had at home

I figured she would be fine for the duration of my work because she had eaten, and then she took another bottle laying on her boppy. So I am pretty sure it was a trust issue and since I had fed her there she decided it was okay to eat there. Who knows what the deal was, point is she is taking a bottle just fine at daycare and I don't have to worry about it anymore! 

She is also starting to sit up by herself. And she scoots when she is on her back

I am so thankful for a community where I can come and ask a question and not get put down or made to feel like I am doing something wrong. I really appreciate you ladies suggesting different things.

Then I had my baby at 37 weeks and he wasn't able to latch because of my flat nipples

The lactation consultants at the hospital were rude and unhelpful, so that's how I'd been feeding him.

Attempts to wean from the shield were unsuccessful and would end in tears all around. Using a shield for me meant I could only feed him sitting up, so I had to prepare formula or pump every time we went out, and then the next day work on bouncing back my supply.

**I set a goal for myself to make it to 3 months and then I would switch to formula.** Well, and he picked it up so well! Yesterday was my first full day feeding him without the shield.

It's amazing. I can feed him lying on my back or side, I don't end up with milk all over me, and he seems to sleep better at night though that could be coincidence.

Since that post we had his tongue tie re-evaluated and re-clipped on a Friday. The ped said we should see ""drastic improvement"" by Monday. By Sunday night I was starting to see his tongue more than I had ever seen it. It was like he was playing with it and figuring out what the heck it was for. The biggest improvement we noticed was that he latched sans nipple shield for about 30 seconds during the 3am feeding on Monday. 


That same Monday

She also suggested that he see a craniosacral therapist who specializes in infants to ""loosen up"" his facial musculature and help him use his tongue better. After researching craniosacral therapy

He had his appointment with the craniosacral therapist

Almost exactly 2 days later, knocking off the nipple shield - basically no improvement from where I started, aside from the fact that I was in a more comfortable position. Fed up, I decided to try taking off the nipple shield again. 

I don't know what was different from when I tried without the nipple shield at the beginning of the feeding or what was different from the previous feeding. But my little nursling LATCHED. He just latched. No crying or screaming, and passed out. 

Since then (last Thursday

I cannot begin to describe the sense of relief and joy I feel about this. I want to thank you all for your encouragement. I had gotten so tired of people saying over and over ""It will get better"" and I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am so glad we've been successfully BF for so long

My new BF goal is to figure out how to NIP. If you have any tips on that

TL:DR I posted two weeks ago that I was about to give up on BF. You all encouraged me and shared your BF tales of woe. After my sons tongue tie was reclipped, and without a nipple shield and he's been going strong for almost a week. I can just whip a boob out and we're good to go. I am so happy!!

EDIT: I forgot to add that I no longer pump before each feeding. Which is a huge relief and timesaver!! The nursling seems to be able to handle the overactive letdown now that he latches better and milk isn't pooling in the nipple shield. This is another huge improvement!

I adore you. Truly

1. All that is required is your mouth and my breasts. You'll notice that when you're STARVING, this may make you less inclined to scream and shriek...

2. I find it to be one of the most adorable things in the world that you feed with a death grip on my shirt/hair/breast. Even when it hurts from your steal tipped, perhaps when those heavy eyelids close over your big beautiful eyes that look right into my soul and seem to threaten my very existence if I so much as clear my throat, scratch an itch, or god forbid surf the web, maybe you could release the death grip. I know you don't understand that we are separate people, or that I am even a person, but I am. I'm a person that hasn't showered

3. The car relaxes me too. I hate driving because I love to be a passenger. When *I* am riding shotgun I like to zone out, it's refreshing. I've noticed that when *you* are bundled in to your carseat, you enjoy other things. Mainly pooping. I've also noticed that if we don't leave for a day, you don't poop for a day. And you certainly don't poop all the way up to your hair. Now when your brother was younger, and my disposable income was greater, those poop outfits got thrown away. We are not doing that anymore. And your grandmothers yell when you have stained clothes. Let's all do our part to keep the grandmothers from yelling shall we?

But that all changed today. 

I pumped like normal, in the normal spot it is supposed to be locked up at.

Then I went to go get my milk after my shift was over

Cue panic. Why would someone move my milk? Where in the hell did they put it? 1000 things rushed through my mind. I went to ask the bartender if he moved it (bartenders are the only other people besides managers who have access to that part of the fridge with a lock and key). He said he did move it to a different shelf. I went back to the walk in

Then one of the cooks pointed to a shelf *outside* of the locked part, on its side, in a pool of water. Cue fury. No cue pure unadulterated wrath. Why the fuck, what the fuck, where in the fuck did that become a good idea? 3 people saw it in the walk-in where it was, so I do have witnesses. I told the manger I was pissed off about it, and I wanted to write a statement. That is NOT okay. Not one bit. The manager blew me off, the bartender said ""it was in the way"" (it was a 5ounce bag of milk in a walk in cooler where we keep kegs of beer and all the wine, and I am super ocd about bacteria and everything and even though I work in an extremely clean restaurant it is the fucking principal of the matter - that is not where it was supposed to be. The managers pretty much blew me off when I asked to be able to complain about it. They defended the bartender. So when I got home I wrote 1 letter to my lawyer, and this is the first time any bartender has ever made a big deal about it. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. I shouldn't have to have this kind of stress on top of just living day to day as a breastfeeding mother who works full time and cant even afford to pay all her bills. I am so fucking furious. If my boss doesn't take this seriously I am going to escalate it to his boss and further until they realize that the shit I have been through since I went back to work is NOT OKAY. It has been one battle after another. Literally having to battle for something I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO BY LAW. 

But I'm going to keep on keeping on, and beyond. I don't fucking care if I have to pump out in the fucking dining room with everyone watching, I will not stop breastfeeding my child for some petty shitheads that I have to work with.

Apparently my husband came home late last night and stayed up playing computer games because he couldn't sleep. I was passed out cold so I don't remember any of this and thought he got into bed at some point.

Around 2:45 am my son woke up wanting to nurse. Since his crib is right next to the bed, very sleepy son rooting for more boob. Look back over at the crib and what I thought was him was the cat! I started laughing hysterically at myself because clearly the infection has gone to my brain or something. Still laughing to myself I scoop up my toddler and snuggle back in the bed.

So tomorrow my little girl will be 4 weeks old and she has been exclusively breastfeeding this whole time. Before she was born

To tell you the truth, and I really didn't want to make myself more at risk for PPD. 

She was born by c-section (she was breeched) on Oct. 2

That first week was the hardest. But the lactation consultant in the hospital was so helpful. My nipples were so tender (just from not being used to being sucked on every 1-2 hours). And she gave me these [medela cooling pads](http://www.amazon.com/Medela-Tender-Care-Hydrogel-Pads/dp/B0011ECPA2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351538884&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=medela+cooling+pad) that helped so much. I highly suggest that all pregnant women preparing to breastfeed have these on hand for those first couple days. I was also putting on [lanolin](http://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-Breast-Cream-1-41-Ounce/dp/B001EPQ1US/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351538949&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lanolin+lanisoh) after every feeding. I broke down to tears maybe once or twice

But after the first week, there wasn't any engorgement or pain whatsoever.

I feel so lucky that I haven't had to experience so many of the problems that many breastfeeding mothers have to go through. I honestly don't mind getting up with her through the night to feed. I love watching her suckle and fall asleep in my arms. I love seeing her milkdrunk face when she's finished. I love the bond I have with her. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I am so happy that I gave breastfeeding a good shot

I successfully and joyfully bfed all three of my older children through at least their first birthdays

But, and turned up her little button nose at anything that wasn't toasty-crunchy until she was good and ready. And that was fine with me.  It was a relief though, when she finally embraced solid foods (except applesauce for some reason.) Not to be intensively feeding a quickly growing baby 'round the clock was a nice break. Except that I hurt all the time.

A couple of months after she was born my feet started to hurt.  I just thought ""got to get back into shape and lose some of this baby weight I put on."" But it got worse.  It spread to my hips, always symmetrically and it even invaded my jaw joint.  It took months for me to not reason it away,  as just needing more rest, more exercise, more sleep.  It took being shocked by loss of my ability to show my son how old he was.  I couldn't hold up the middle three fingers of my right hand.  I was left looking at the claw shape I was making instead and thinking, ""Oh, shit."" 

So, just going about my day, *hurts* so much.  And there's the rub. My best chances of avoiding permanent damage is starting aggressive treatment as soon as possible, including a lower dose regimen of a chemotherapy drug.  

So I'm weening her.  She is cooperating beautifully with taking bottles. I'm down to crying once a day.  It doesn't help that googling ""weening"" leads to lots of articles about ""baby led weening"" and the joys of extended breast feeding. Damn it Google. I wouldn't look it up if I didn't have to! Stop lecturing me! There are no good resources since the recommendations I eventually found for medically nessecitated weening boiled down to

""Wow, it's tons of planning and hours per day during my work week. Yes, it's ""inconvenient"". But it's so worth it to me. And I love that the bottles she gets when I'm away are just eating to her, but when we're together, she LOVES breastfeeding and taking her time to snuggle, coo, and just be happy she's with Mama. It's so wonderful after a crazy day of meetings. 

And ya know what? The courage to try this and make it work came from YOU, you'll be committed and it will work out"". It was SO empowering to me to focus on the positive and have faith in my body and my determination to keep Clara on my milk.

Just because you ""couldn't"" breastfeed does not mean I wont be able to, I know it'll take some more patience and practice than mixing water and powder. I don't need you making it sound like the worst thing in the world to make yourself feel better about giving up. 

I know there are women who honestly tried as hard as they could until they had no choice but to resort to formula

I'm due on November 13th and am fully ready to take on the challenge of breastfeeding because I know how beneficial it is. What I don't know is how successful I can be without the support of family and friends. I'm a young mother-to-be so both my family (who fully support and encourage my decision) and my husbands family will play a big role in our lives whether we like it or not. My mother in law, then at least just shut them up. 

What I'm asking for is advice on how to handle the next situation that comes up where I feel like I am being bullied into giving up before I've even tried. Also


**TL:DR I'm tired of women trying to justify how they gave up by telling me how hard and improbable it is that I will be able to successfully breastfeed my son. How can I tell them that I'm committed and what are some *facts* I can use that will help them accept if not support my decision?**

Long story short, he's the most awesome feminist dude I know, and yet.. when confronted with a situation like this, he still reverted back to what our culture tells us to do - shame the breastfeeder, and not the pervert taking advantage of the situation.

I talked to an LC yesterday (finally), and giving him no choice but to feed right from the breast. She said to pump a little before so I would already be ""let down"" and he wouldn't have to work as hard at first.

Well, he just sucks on the tip, so how could he figure out my nipples?!) The first feeding with the nipple shield was HORRIBLE!!! He SCREAMED and screamed and just was NOT happy about it, at all. Then I realized that the lact-aid was braking the suction under the nipple shield, so he couldn't get anything out! No wonder he was so mad at me... I took the lact-aid out of the picture (waste of $60, ugh), fought with him for another 15 minutes or so, so I ended that feed.

Then, and I was prepared to fight with him like that again, but to my amazement, he saw the shield and did a face-plant right into my breast, latched on PERFECTLY and closed his eyes. He finished that breast and went to sleep! Not ONE SINGLE fuss out of him! I'm ECSTATIC!!!!!

I sooo hope he continues to do this well with the shield from now on. It's going to be hard this weekend and next week since we are going on vacation 8 hours away, and how hard it was to get to this point.

I have been able to get her down for naps before

I am not ready to ""stop"" breastfeeding

Edit: A few of you have asked how I did it - I wish I had some magic answer for you

- I've been working for months to get her down for naps without nursing. I'm more willing to work longer and harder at this at naptime because I have more energy and flexibility than I do at bedtime. So that was the first step for me - just getting her down **at all** without nursing. 

- We developed a system where I would nurse

- From there,"" or sooner if we start seeing lots of sleep cues, we scoop her up, give her her sleep toy and pacifier, put out the light and talk or sing softly to her. We have just been trying this every single night to see if we can just get her to go to sleep that way without the boob. And it finally worked! Since then we've had mixed results but we are just going to keep at it. 

- A lot of it was really up to her. We seem to be very gradually starting down the road to weaning. She's dropped her naptime bottle at day care

- As with most things I have found you just have to be brave and determined. Brave enough to try doing something that might make your baby cry; determined enough to try it over and over and over and over again even when you are thinking to yourself, to grab a blanket for her if it's cold, to put out the light and turn on the humidifier, etc. It's a two-man job for sure.

Mind you, he has type 1 diabetes, so it wasn't caused by any life choices he made. Whether or not it is related to the fact that he was formula fed

They made up later that day and my boyfriend made it clear that the choices we've made on how we are going to raise our daughter are not going to change. She cried about how she only wanted what was best for her granddaughter and that she only meant well.

I thought this was all over once the argument was settled, etc.) that we breathe in can end up in breastmilk. My boyfriend will retort with an article he read about chemicals that are used to make rocket fuel were found in formula. She will just dismiss any evidence he brings up as just being ""not true"".

She goes on about our daughter's ""gas"" problem and how colicky she is. Yeah

After the horrible C- Section and even worse recovery, was under 18 and that meant she was a visitor and had to follow the visitor policy (no one after 8pm, they had told me). 

I don't know if anyone has ever told you, your boobs explode with milk and invariably you either have a flow that is too slow, a flow that is too fast, a baby that is too fast or a baby that is too slow. It's never as magical as people would make it seem. You see a woman breastfeeding in a restaurant and all you see is beauty, what you don't see is when she was crying at 5am because the baby bit her, AGAIN.

You always hear that breast is best, I pumped, I put her on the boob for everything. And it didn't work. 
I sighed as I placed the bottle on the counter. ""Why couldn't I do it? What's wrong with me?"". In all the despair and pain, there are milk banks. It takes a prescription and then costs about $600 a month. They actually make a profit off of women who are pumping and spending their time in order to help a baby. Why not just cut out the middle man and help each other? I email and post and beg and plead for milk. So many times I hear how I should give up and offer formula, that formula isn't poison. And it's not. But it also doesn't help soothe the wounds of breastfeeding failure. 

Once the milk is heated through, screaming for food. I pick her up and she grabs the bottle greedily. I cuddle her, knowing it's not the same, but get comfort in the fact that she is getting what's best. Even if I didn't make it myself.

1359265016.0,17cung,Struggling to breast feed? Don't give up. You and your little one can do it!,OcelotCircus,31,0,7,"We had a rough start, like a horrible mother

I continued to offer the breast before every feeding, resulting in horribly plugged ducts (talking about clearing new plugged ducts after every pumping session, and enough plugged ducts to harden 3/4 my breast) and recurring cases of mastitis. I still had to pump every session in addition to trying to feed her. She ate every two hours, it took about 45 minutes per feeding to accomplish what I needed to. Leaving the house was a nightmare. I wasn't getting sleep. 

The night before her 4 week mark I tried to put her to the breast and, I turned to my husband and told him I was exclusively pumping for the next year or two. He nodded in support. She got bottles throughout the night. 

The next morning

She fed from that side beautifully. She was really hungry and using my breast for its intended purpose and not a pacifier for what seemed like the first time. She hasn't latched onto the other side in weeks. Not even an attempt was made on her part no matter what position I held her. I decided I would try anyway. It took some time

Right after this feeding she promptly fell asleep. This is the first time she felt satisfied from the breast. At this point i couldnt believe what had happened. Did she really just do what I thought she did?!  She fed all day

 We have exclusively nursed for 3 weeks now. I couldn't be happier. :) After weeks of instant gratification from a bottle i thought for sure our nursing relationship was completely hopeless. Turns out its never too late as long as you've got the pumps going! I hope my story can be a little source of inspiration to someone out there. Don't give up!!!

I am not one of those moms who lost weight due to breastfeeding

I am so impressed with the amount of mothers on here who are trying to breastfeed. If you go [here](http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm) you will see that while initial rates are high, and I know it isn't easy, we all come from different walks in life. And by no means should anyone continue breastfeeding if it is hampering their mental state. Happy mom, happy baby, that is the rule I go by. I question myself every day if I am still okay with what I am doing, if it is impacting me personally negatively. Obviously right now I am totally happy to continue doing it, but that may change tomorrow.

Baby just isn't adjusting well or is going through separation anxiety. He's 11 months now. Won't let me put him down(he's 32 lbs!) waking every 30 minutes... I'm using every ounce of creativity to deal with it all.

So anyway

I had 101.3 fever and was vomiting so I went to the ER. It was PACKED. 

I waited 2 hours throwing up in the lobby. I frantically searched /r/breastfeeding for advice on my phone and came across a comment about milk blisters and a light bulb went off. I had noticed whenever my son would delatch there would be this tiny white glob on the tip of my nipple. I thought it must be the clog trying to work its way out and assumed it was why he was fussing so much. The commenter (I can't for the life of me find the comment now) said she took a needle and pierced the blister and milk came out like rain. At that moment my husband texted that he just couldn't soothe the baby, sympathetic triage nurse that I had to go feed the baby, but I'd be back. 

I got home

Baby is sound asleep next to me now, but most importantly I'm not in excruciating pain and I don't have to go back to the freak show that is the emergency room!

In a typical night, then roll over and go to sleep.  (I should mention that we co-sleep).  For the past month or so he has been wanting to stay on the boob, ALL NIGHT LONG.  It starts at about 2 am, when all his deep sleeping is done.  He'll want the boob, but then doesn't drop it.  If I try to take it out of his mouth he SCREAMS.  It doesn't matter how long I wait, he is never in a deep enough sleep for me to do anything.  I can't move, I can't roll over, after over an hour of him on my boob

I AM SOOOO F-ING READY TO QUIT!  I can't do this any more.  I can't take this.  My goal was to bf at the very least until he was two

I want to continue breastfeeding, walk him around, go back to bed.  But no more boob in the middle of the night.  I know it is going to be a rough couple of days, but I have to get the message across to him that I am not a night time pacifier.  

Sorry in advance for any errors

The one having an issue was actually my 4 month old girl. But she's always very clingy, and they both have the habit of nursing once they're up. So if I could do anything differently with these two, I'd have them take their naps at different times. That way I  could nurse one without the other fussing from hunger/wanting to be with mommy.

But as I said, and there was no problem with my milk supply. (I was gonna drink the milk tea someone here had recommended, but I didn't have the time to look for it.)

I hate it so much and I'm going insane. 

Everytime I try to get him to latch during the day he turns his head, pushes away.. I have no idea why! I don't know what I did amd it makes me so sad. I loved breastfeeding. Last night was the first time he nursed while sleepy before bed and I was so so happy. Tonight I thought I'd try again and he wouldn't nurse. Refused. Kept crying until I gave in and gave him a bottle (of breast milk.)

I am pumping enough for him but it sucks. I had a break down tonight when I couldn't let down for that stupid freaking pump. I just couldn't. Pumping takes thirty minutes and I pump every three hours. I have to drag it around everywhere and pump in bathrooms or the car and then feed my son a bottle. 

I wanted to breastfeed him for a year and it was going so well. He was gaining weight perfectly

For any new mom's out there struggling with breastfeeding issues, contact Dr. Jack Newman by email (he does answer), seek out an IBCLC - if you're in a remote area some will Skype. Just keep going!

I went through the ringer with breastfeeding - low milk supply and was eventually ""diagnosed"" with hypoplastic breasts

Two things I wish someone had told me before I started on this journey:

Breastfeeding is more than just breastmilk. If you absolutely cannot get up to a full supply

Use a slow flow nipple. I have tried nearly all the bottles on the market (I just couldnt get an SNS to work for me and I was fried at that point). I had good luck with the Como Tomo bottle with a newborn nipple. I have seen so many mothers discontinue their breastfeeding relationship early because they are using too fast of a flow nipple.

First off I wanted to explain that I did not want to breastfeed at all mainly because to start with I am a very private person and the whole idea of it makes me uncomfortable (notice the present tense) Well my husband convinced me because the milk is good for my Lilly and I needed to get over myself anyway.

That being said she doesn't nurse very often. Maybe once a week if that and she only gets breastmilk

I have a double Avent hospital grade pump. I pump every 2-2.5 hours unless my boobs start itching then I pump on the spot. On average I get about 7.5-10 oz per pumping session. Lilly eats every 3-4 hours on average (on demand feeding) and each time she eats she does about 4oz (Unless she's fussy then om nom 6oz)

I supply about 42 EXTRA oz a day. By extra I mean I keep 6

Due to all of the extra milk I am a long term donor to a woman who cannot breastfeed. I do not wish to correct this oversupply it really isn't a problem to me at all.

Overall the fact that I can solely pump makes me much more comfortable with breastfeeding because it does still bother me. :) Honestly judge me as you please but just know not only do I have a happy healthy breastmilk child of my own

We wandered in and the automatic lights came on and there was a lone baby sitting in a car seat. No mommy in sight. Well... she wants the boob so I'm not going to let a little audience stop me. We all sat down and I popped out the goods and we started feeding. It was about 10 minutes before the mother peeked into the room for her child. (And to mention, someone left a poop filled diaper in the room on the bench even though there are signs all over the room asking people to not leave diapers in the room and to not dispose of diapers in the trash there)


She looked at us


My LO feeds for 20 mins per breast

I finally found a new pediatrician. While we still have to use the old cantankerous doctor for wellness/vaccination visits (something to do with social insurance-these visits are free and keep healthy kids away from the sick ones
She checked my daughter out today and affirmed what some of you had said about my daughter's weight being normal and as well as keeping up the feeding. She did not discourage, and am actually looking forward to not having to think about weening anytime soon. 

So happy to have found support in pediatrics and in the /r/breastfeeding community.

http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1hm76l/4_days_in_excruciating_pain_not_sure_if_i_can_do/

Update:  I stuck with nearly 2 days of pumping every 2 hours and not breastfeeding.  It has been so very hard to deny my baby the breast :(  I called my insurance's help line and saw another lactation consultant today on a home visit and this one was wonderful.  She checked my baby for tongue tie and found nothing but found that my baby had a shallow latch.  She looked at the nipple shield the hospital gave me and found it to be much to small so she gave me a new shield of an appropriate size!  She said my technique was correct but the shallow latch was the problem.  I put on the new shield

My baby hasn't been gaining weight at an appropriate rate.  She was 8 lbs at birth, the new plan is breastfeeding on demand with the nipple shield as long as the pain is okay, pump after some feedings (only 3-4 times/day) and offer all extra breast milk.  If she takes all the extra breast milk, offer 1 oz of formula at a time and up to 4 oz a day if she wants it each time.  The nurse also gave me prescriptions for ointments to keep infection at bay.  We'll re-weigh the baby at her doctor's appointment next week.  

I'm so relieved to have a plan but I feel awful that my baby's been hungry and I haven't fed her adequately but I can try to get over that by hoping this new plan works.  My baby already seems much more satisfied and has pretty much been in a milk coma all day :P  I can't express how relieved I am to have my baby back on the breast!

After losing too much weight and not pooping enough week 1, flat nipples and counseled that it would just take some time. My supply was awful because of the inadequate stimulation despite pumping 8x a day. None of the herbs work, but domperidone definitely does.

I'm now happy to report that we have been formula free for 3 weeks. We have been without supplemental bottles for a week. The only bottles he gets are while I'm at work. At home I'm nursing every 2-3 hours, and then before bed. Not pumping a bizillion times during the day on the weekend makes me so much happier and calm. 

I'm SO proud of myself for sticking it out. It was the hardest and most disheartening thing I ever had to deal with. I wish I were exaggerating but I'm not. I've never not been able to do something if I put my mind to it... and this FINALLY worked, it does get easier. I didn't believe it either when I read posts saying it would, but it does. 

If you're in the trenches now
* drink a ton of water and Gatorade. Whatever is in Gatorade seemed to boost my supply. 
* Remember to eat. Protein bars are quick and easy. 
* Toss the damn boppy or wait and use it for tummy time. Get a My Brest Friend. 
* Inhousepharmacy.biz is quick
* Don't quit today. Give yourself permission to quit tomorrow. It'll give you time to think and calm down. If setting goals 3-6 months out seems too much (it did for me)
* Pump parts will survive being thrown. Pumpin Pals flanges are way more comfortable and don't suck your nipple all the way down the tube. 
* Any breastmilk is better than none, so be it. Just keep practicing the latch when you and baby are calm and able and then do what you need to do to feed the baby without feeling guilty.

I also received helpful tipps and tricks from a wonderful lactation consultant.

Right now i'm almost exclusively pumping, he'll get as much milk as he needs from my breast.

My lactation consultant advised us to switch to the Medela Calma when we feed breastmilk - that way he learns to suck in order to get the breastmilk. I can see he's having trouble getting the milk but eventually making it. He loses the nipple very often or accidently pushes it out of his mouth

http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/17dfl4/serious_latch_issues_help/

So my nipples are both cracked and bloody

Today we made it a priority to go to the Breastfeeding Clinic at our hospital. They were so amazing! I wish that I had gone there before we were discharged. 

They showed me how to latch him differently - basically hold his neck with one hand and bring his chin into your boob so his face is at a 45 degree angle. The nipple should be at nose level. With the other hand sandwich your boob an inch or two above the aereola. Wait for a wide mouth and try to tuck your boob in so that your nipple hits the roof of the babies mouth. 

Then! Take your hand off your boob and put it behind baby's back so you're cuddling him. Pull him in tight and close to you

Leaning back really helps to get comfortable and will help the baby fix the latch if it's not quite right. 

This is a lot of instruction that was opposite what the midwives told me. They said that 60 seconds or so of stabbing pain was normal when he first latched. Now there is NO PAIN. I was crying from happiness. 

I hope that helps some of you. Pm me if you don't quite understand (it's hard to write it out to make sense).

Here's my problem: Breastfeeding was the pits for me. I had a traumatic delivery with my first baby which landed him in the NICU for over a week. When he was born, the next two days, I was allowed to breastfeed him, but since I wasn't producing milk yet, I used an SNS with donated milk so that he was getting the amount they required him to get and to stimulate my milk production. In the mean times I was pumping my poor nipples off and getting oh so little colostrum ([like, a drop out of each nipple after 15-20 minutes on the pump](http://imgur.com/Dsx2TvG).) The day it started making the switch to becoming milk, they inserted an NG tube (and I still don't really know why, I was getting all of 3-5mL if I was lucky. And that was out of both breasts. So we went another six days not being able to breastfeed because they were feeding through NG then bottles just to get him out of the hospital and home. All the while I was still pumping every 1.5-2 hours and the amount was still not increasing at all.

When we finally got him home, everything. I was so defeated and I still couldn't pump more than 7mL even after deciding to pump more. I'd pump for 15-30 minutes every hour to hour and a half maybe 3-4 times in a row, then I'd lay off for 3-4 hours and pump again. Nothing helped. I made lactation cookies, I took Fenugreek, I drank Mother's Milk Tea (shit's gross just FYI), and I took [Lactation Support](http://www.amazon.com/Gaia-Herbs-Lactation-Support-Phyto-Capsules/dp/B005ACNNKC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368155873&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lactation+supplement) all to no avail.

I felt so defeated and although my husband was supportive, being depressed, not sleeping, and pumping with no results, I gave up. He was already on formula so what was the point in pumping so little if all of his sustenance was coming from that anyway?

He's older now

Now I'm pregnant with number two and **I was wondering if there is anything I can do to... ""help"" my boobs, **is there any hope for me? Is there anything I can do?** I have a (shitty) single electric pump, **can I start trying to pump a couple of weeks before I am due to get colostrum flowing?** I have a few tricks up my sleeve this time around since I already have some experience and the #1 is: If guests in my home have nothing supportive to say, they will be removed until they can get their shit together (looking at you, MIL). Also, I have already made some lactation cookie dough and frozen it so all we'll have to do is thaw and bake. 

**Do you have any tips/tricks/success stories where #1 was horrible but #2 was easier?**

Besides, though I'm sure I'll need to freeze some milk anyway.

* When a newborn
* Baby dropped to 5th percentile by 5 months (from 50th) and stopped sleeping. Dr began to worry and sent me to the LC. 
* LC was all like, nose throat dr. 
* Our insurance was like

Miguel is 6 months now and had his tongue-tie fixed a little after he turned 5 months. Because he was an older baby

However, I broke down and bought a Medela Pump In Style and pumped 4-6 times a day in an effort to save my supply. I honestly believe that, if it wasn't for that awesome pump, I would have dried up. I pumped maybe 2- 2.5 oz from both breasts each time. Nowhere near enough. 

About two weeks ago, thinking I was doing something awful if I gave it to him. I really, really, really wanted to make it to 6 months EBF. But then one night I actually heard his belly growl and that sealed the deal. I would have to supplement. It broke my heart. I cried while giving him the bottle, feeling like shit because I couldn't reach my goal. But his belly was finally full and he slept like a champ. 

At this time, but I needed to fatten up this kid. He LOVED the foods, though. 

Nowadays, keeping baby from being too distracted to nurse (we basically have to nurse in one spot in the bedroom in silence), and getting him to prefer the breast over the bottle again (AKA, getting milk to let-down quicker). UGGGGGHHHHHH...

Right now, and it's not approved by the FDA, but it's doing the trick. Today I pumped 4 oz from one breast! Two days ago, Miguel got milk drunk for the first time since he was a newborn. Also, today was the first time Miguel was on the breast for more than two minutes and actually came away satisfied. Next week is his weight check and we'll see where he is. I can tell he's gaining weight because his head isn't as knobbly, his wrists and thighs have creases, and his clothes are tighter. 

This ended up longer than I expected, but it just didn't work out. Maybe one day I'll get over having to use formula, but for right now my goal is to stop supplementing by the end of next week. Is breastfeeding worth it? I can honestly say I have no idea. I really have no idea, since he seemed equally as happy and attached while eating formula. But dammit, I'm going to keep going and hopefully make it to a year. We're slowly, but surely, getting back on track.

We've tried talking about it - ""You're a big girl now, babies drink from boobies; not big girls."" She just told me that she is a big girl, but she likes boobie milk. She's also really polite about it. She asks to nurse with a ""please"" and finishes with a ""thank you"". Sometimes she even pats them and kisses the good-bye before I stuff them back in my bra! She's a cool kid. I just don't want her to have any difficulties because I should have been more assertive about weaning.

Thought it could maybe help encourage someone else. 

It took 5 days to come back from the strike

Monday night he first refused, either.  I ended up sobbing on the stairs just outside his room after he squirmed and fussed when I tried to put him back down when he woke later in the night, obviously missing his routine of nursing to sleep but refusing to do so, leaving me at an impasse. I finally rocked and sang until he went down, and then went and cried.

Wednesday morning he still vehemently refused to even be put in cradle hold and cried the whole time it took to get a bottle warm. That evening I put the big kids to bed and tried taking a bath with him. He loved the bath but it didn't seem to do any good nursing-wise. We hung out with him in a diaper and me topless for a while and he played (and pinched!) my boobs but still wasn't interested. We had a good snuggle before bed though and minimal crying and I thought I might be able to deal with him not nursing if I couldn't work it out

Thursday in the night he still just wanted to snuggle but fussed and squirmed until he put himself in cradle hold, and he took it ok. That night he let me cradle him again, but turned away when I offered the breast. 

Friday for some reason I got really depressed again. I didn't even try to nurse that morning, and the whole day while I was apart from him I was just down and apathetic about everything. I got home earlier than usual and spent the whole evening with him, which helped my mood a little, and once again didn't even try to offer the breast at bedtime, which made him less fussy. Then I went and pumped and just sobbed because I only got 2 oz where Monday night I got 7. I cried to my husband about wanting to give up. For the first time in over a year, I didn't even bother to sleep in a bra because I felt so empty.

Then Saturday! He woke around 5 am and I'd just been singing him back to sleep at that waking time so I tried, the little stinker. I was afraid I was so empty he'd get impatient and mad, but he worked until he got letdown, and kept nursing long after until we finally switched sides. I probably nursed him for a solid hour, twice on each side, before he let go and fell asleep. It was an answer to prayer, and I told myself if he never nursed again at least I had that sweet memory to hold onto. 

But he nursed again later that morning, and at nap time. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we made it through, even tho I had to be away from him tonight. So happy that we'll be able to continue, but treating every day like it could be the last, just in case. 

**TL;DR** My 12 month old went on 5 day nursing strike

-Use disposable tin pans with heating directions on top (e.g.
 
-Lasagna, pork chops in a creamy rice casserole, stuffed peppers, homemade beef and broccoli with noodles, rotisserie chicken w/ sides, spaghetti, meatloaf

-Bowl of fresh fruit salad

-Cooked or raw vegetables (in disposable containers)

-Vegetable trays (small to save refrigerator space)

-Baked goods: banana bread (make it healthy with flax, etc., if possible) and a jar of natural peanut butter

-Muffins (they can also be frozen in Ziploc bags)

-Snacks (pistachios, cheese, cheese sticks, granola bars, hummus, pita chips, apples, fruit

-6 pack or more of water bottles (nursing moms get dehydrated easily)

-Disposable plates and cutlery (cuts down on dishes)

-Anything with iron and fiber

-Healthy frozen food from the store if you are cooking challenged

-Gift cards to restaurants

1355184882.0,14mv1b,Low supply is replenishing! :),sammies4787,28,8,4,"So

Well, :).  I almost switched to formula twice because LO would scream and cry every time I fed her and we both were miserable.  Having a positive attitude also helped me out a lot.  It's funny but I would imagine flowing rivers of milk while I fed her and that not only relaxed me but I think it's helped me visualize it coming back. 

Thank you all for your advice.  For those with a low milk supply I suggest to keep feeding your LO whenever they want and however long they want.  The most important thing is to not schedule your baby when breastfeeding.  Keep going and do not give up!  :)",self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/14mv1b/low_supply_is_replenishing/

Yes, however, I do feel that the accepting of this donation threatens WHO's credibility regarding the promotion of breastfeeding. ",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/13mkby/the_panamerican_office_of_who_has_changed_its/

The in laws had the baby overnight, but I don't know if it was stress or what, but I just kept lactating through shirt after shirt, even just shortly after pumping. 

I went to go pick up my son and wore bra pads

My MIL was horrified

Edit: Thanks ladies! I'm sure my MIL didn't mean to come off as disgusted as she did. She's a nice lady

She's still been nursing on demand and averages 5-10 times a day. Always to go to sleep for nap and bed. Two days ago she nursed around 7 times and the next morning when she went to nurse she had a bad latch and only made loud noises. It made her sad that it was not working right. That whole day every time she tried she just bit me and moved her tongue around then got off and said all done. She seems really confused as to why it's not going as it has. She went all day today without it and without a nap. She tried this evening for bed and again just bit down,False,
