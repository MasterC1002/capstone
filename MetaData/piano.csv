1357555647.0,1644x9,"I tuned my first piano yesteday for a friend, here is my braindump...",7Geordi,77,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/1644x9/i_tuned_my_first_piano_yesteday_for_a_friend_here/

A friend asked me to tune her piano in exchange for food and company because she could not afford to have her piano tuned professionally. I conceded! The instrument was a Young Chang U 121

Here's what I knew going in:

* Tuning a piano is very hard.
* One of my piano teachers was also a piano tuner and would tune my family's baby grand from time to time. He took the liberty of teaching me how to tune it. His approach was mostly based on listening. He would use a tone generator to tune the central three octave
* I would need a tuning hammer, but the tuner I had was quite good and I decided to risk it.
* The pegs are seated in ~~cork~~ laminated wood (*thank you iamaturtle*) or a similar substance and are held in place by friction (not mechanically like on a guitar)

Here's what I learned:

* Tuning a piano is much much harder than ""very hard""
* Tuning a piano takes a long fucking time, but the damn thing still didn't sound as good as I wanted everywhere.
* Tuning a piano is probably the greatest listening exercise I have ever done. Between trying to find the interference patterns on low notes
* At first I tried to tune each string in a triplet independently, and then tuning the other two against it by ear alone.
* Tuning the middle octaves with help and then working outwards by ear was untenable, and flat going down. So I ended up doing the best I could by ear as an exercise and then just using the tuner anyway... that is, until the tuner could no longer hear the note I was playing (this happened two octaves from the top and one octave from the bottom). Then I ended up really doubling down with the listening.
* Tuning the high strings was crazy hard. Once you're in the undamped zone, so I often found myself trying to pick out one tone among seven or eight similar tones. When tuning the second and third chord in a triplet, interference was completely indistinguishable, but thankfully I noticed that when they are in tune, the note suddenly gets significantly louder. This was the key observation that saved me, and at the end, the last octave actually sounded quite decent.
* Tuning the low strings was merely hard. My ear could not distinguish their pitch very quickly, and I often didn't have enough time to make it go away.
* Tuning the middle strings was hard - mostly because the damn things just didn't want to change pitch. Also because I started with the middle
* The pegs in each region responded very differently. I found the high-note pegs to be very responsive
* A big surprise was that strings seemed to keep their new tone much more reliably if I over-tightened slightly and then relaxed them to where I wanted them. This concerned me
* When tuning the top notes by ear, C6, C7). I found I felt much more confident in my pitch comparisons than if I had just played one octave below.
* I played many chords over the tuned region as I worked; this was both extremely disheartening

The end result was entirely playable. My friend was actually very pleased and could not tell that some of the notes were a bit of a tragedy still. That said she is somewhat tone-deaf. When I played the piano after I finished, so I closed it up and played a few more songs. It actually sounded pretty decent, it was clear that the first few octaves I did were less well done than the later ones, so I definitely learned something!",,False,self,1357574379.0,t3_1644x9

This does assume you can read sheet music and can play basic chords. I tried to avoid theory concepts as much as possible.

I put this together because there are a lot of posts on r/piano linking to songs that are played in this type of style

(Full disclosure - credit to my instructor for really prompting this ""Eureka"" moment). 

I have ""intellectually"" understood modes for a long time (""D Dorian is just the notes of C played from D to D"") but it's only been in the last week that it really clicked for me how to *use* them and my improv playing sounds noticeably better (to me at least) as a result.
  
The key insight for me is that the best way to think of a mode is as a scale of **thirds** (i.e. a giant chord) and NOT as a diatonic sequence.  So, but starting on C"", so: C,D,Eb, F, G, Bb
  
Ah

  C-Eb-G-Bb-D-F-A-C
  
Same notes

This is an extended chord sure but try thinking of THIS sequence of notes as the scale to noodle on. This will keep you from clashing.  For instance
  
It gets better.  To flip to
  
  C-Eb-G-Bb-Db-F-Ab-C
  
Try going back and forth between the two.  Play Cm7 in the LH and run up the first scale and down the second - it's a pretty easy change because from a fingering point of view you're changing the RH from a D minor to a Db major.  There's a really cool shift of tonality.  If you were sitting in a Cm7 you could alternate between these two scales and get some interesting sounds. 
  
So my experience is - if you ""picture"" the mode as an extended chord rather than a ""shifted diatonic sequence"" it's easier to picture and more importantly easy to use.  You'll get bored playing only chord tones

Well I'm a beginning pianist

I've done a search of this reddit for some ideas of what to play but unfortunately there's usually only a couple of posts and they're all at different levels.

So can we please just get one nice list of songs (possibly for the sidebar?) you think would be good for beginners to learn? It might also be nice to contribute some of your favourite pieces that others mightn't know about

So here are a few pieces I've found that I want to progress from.

[*Minuet* by Bach](http://www.8notes.com/scores/2402.asp?view=full&amp;ftype=gif)

[*'Spring' from the Four Seasons* by Vivaldi](http://www.8notes.com/scores/440.asp?view=full&amp;ftype=gif)

[*Greensleeves*](http://8notes.com/scores/7238.asp?ftype=gif)

Though I'm having a bit of a problem getting my rhythm down with my left hand on Greensleeves. That said

As you can see, no offence aramadia, it's a fantastic piece which I really want to learn.

Cheers

Transcription: http://minus.com/mvnsthKSz

I kept the transcription fairly close to what he's playing and how he's playing it (instead of simplifying it) and so a few warnings:

* If you have small hands like me and can't reach an interval of a 10th in your left hand, or cheat (curse you small hands!). For example, in measure 6: instead of an F,C,A in left hand, maybe start with F,C, hold the pedal,D, play both G's with the right hand. In measure 9

* If you're trying to learn this note for note, and probably sound better too!

Questions to help fuel the discussion and get everyone thinking:

* How do you plan out your practice for the day/week/month?
* How do you get everything done that you need to?  The world of music is massive
* How do you stay on track and make sure you're ""practicing"" and not just ""playing.""
* Do you practice things in all twelve keys?
* Do you practice very slow and very fast?
* Do you work on one piece at a time or do you work on multiple pieces? How many?
* Do you practice improvisation? How?
* Do you work on memorization? How?
* Do you spend time learning about music theory?
* How much time do you set aside every day for practice?
* What are your long term goals?

Pianoboy and I have been looking at the feedback and here are a few **goals we have going forward**:

* **Start a weekly piano-related discussion and encourage more discussions in general.**  (You can all help by **upvoting discussions!**)

* **Be more active in moderation**.  We will be: closing more posts (while directing those posters to other sources of information), restrict image memes, eliminate duplicate questions, etc.

* **Update and expand the FAQ**.  People seem to like the FAQ

* **Figure out some way to organize sheet music requests**. We will probably be directing more people to /r/transcribe and /r/MusicNotes in the future as well as distancing ourselves from Synthesia/tutorial requests. We're going to add another section to the FAQ about sheet music and keep building up the new [repertoire section](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/wiki/faq#wiki_repertoire).

We found that people come to /r/piano for many different reasons

Long version:  I have a 10 year old daughter and a 7 year old son.  They both started piano lessons around age 4 or 5.  I play well enough to stay ahead of the 10 year old pretty easily.  They both take lessons from the same lady

Everybody always says ""I wish my parents had made me stay with piano"".  I decided to be that parent.  It is getting harder and harder, and honestly, she has a tendency to be lazy with everything (schoolwork, chores...).  Should I redouble my efforts to get her to practice better, or throw in the towel?

I don't believe the problem is the teacher.  I believe it is the students (and possibly the parent) :)

**Welcome**

Hello Everyone! After talking with a few people, and others are willing to help out, which is great! I really want this to succeed, so I'm always open to suggestions and modifying how this is run, and I'm committed to keeping this idea active and continuing each month. Please read everything below and then participate in helping to select pieces for January and fine tuning our process with your feedback.

---

Logistics

---

**Timeline**

* A few days before the end of each month

* At the beginning of the new month

---

**Piece Selection**

* We'll start with ~~Beginner
 **Edit: 1) No specific categories. Suggest any piece
             2) Suggest pieces in any style (e.g. jazz
             3) Suggest improv/composition challenge ideas

* We won't limit pieces to classical music

* I'll request piece selections from the community and rely on votes &amp; comments (and my good judgment? ha!) for finalizing the choices -- but in a timely manner. We may want themes for certain months

* We may have ~2 selected pieces per difficulty level for variety. Again

* We'll always welcome people to work on any piece of their choice outside of the suggested options. I don't want this to die out because people don't like the selections. The goal is to get people involved in learning music and for them to be able to share their successes with us.

* Legality - we'll start off trying to keep things as ""legal"" as possible
    Note: If we do end up doing some sort of improv category, but I see this venture as more of an educational thing (learning a piece and receiving feedback) than a performance, so I'm okay with it. If there are concerns over this we could tweak the requirements.

[**New:**] Compositions - We'll encourage original compositions to be submitted. Again

---

**Submissions**

* You are encouraged to post your submission as a separate post to r/piano anytime during the month. Please put ""[Piano Jam]"" somewhere in the submission title

* OR

* Please try to use YouTube or SoundClound for your links for accessibility &amp; reliability.

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and successes with the community!

* Again

---

**Request for January Pieces**

* Please post your recommended selections for this month in the comments below

* Vote on your favorite piece suggestions

* There is no overall ""theme"" for January - anything goes.

---

**Next Steps**

* Remember to suggest pieces for January in the comments

* In 1 to 2 days I will create our January Piano Jam post with the selections for this month

* Always feel free to comment or PM me with suggestions

It is extremely hard to nail down my favorite piece of this incredible timeframe but....

My absolute favorite 'romantic composition' of all time...is:

[Charles-Valentin Alkan -- Symphony for solo piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Z5P1gAjyE)

It has gotten me through and contributed to many depressive episodes in my life!

I saw Marc-Andre Hamelin perform this piece last April live in DC...and I was absolutely blown away...he received a 5 minute standing ovation from the entire audience for his interpretation of Alkan and Chopin.

Little bit of information about myself - I was born into a musical family where my dad is a DMA out of UMichigan and my mom a concerto pianist out of China. Needless to say I was brought up in a very musically competitive environment. I grew up to win multiple awards and have played at places such as Carnegie Hall while I was in High School.

Here's some of my previous performances (all of which done sophomore year in high school)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VJpciouQdg

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWHNtNtm8h0

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1rxcvO_1l4

I have since gone out of the serious piano scene after college

My videos would probably be 5-10 minutes long each

Beginner:

* Form - how to start to play the piano correctly

* Basic music theory - major/minor scales, etc

* Finger exercises - Hanon, etc

* Simple song transcriptions - would probably be popular among the folks that ""just wanna play that Beyonce tune"".

Intermediate:

* Finger dexterity - I didn't put this in finger exercises because it focuses more on the type of sound you get with different ways to press the keys

* Interpreting musical passages - taking standard repertoire and dissecting certain parts. This part I'm flexible on because I can take suggestions from viewers.  I will probably include pieces like certain Chopin Etudes, maybe even some modern pieces such as Prokofiev sonatas or Liszt Transcendental Etudes (more advanced). New age stuff like Phillip Glass and Steven Cravis would also work but less challenging.. 

* Composers

* Memorization tips - different theories into how to memorize music &amp; when to do it.

* Other general tips that I think up as I go along.

If you're new to /r/piano, we'd love to hear you play! See the guidelines at the bottom of this post.

This month has some more 20th century pieces thrown in, and even a Joplin rag (no, not Maple Leaf Rag, but don't let me stop you from doing that). I copied last month with a couple of popular intermediate-level Bach and Chopin pieces as those always get a good response (and I like a good response), although these two might be a little harder than last month's. I'm sure a few of you will already know the Debussy as well. There are a lot of pieces to choose from, so hopefully there's something for everyone!

It would still be great to hear some more national anthems or Olympic themes. And where have the Jazz guys/gals been (besides Sochamelet)? Howabout some Rhythm Changes or something?

1368818169.0,1ej9jg,My relationship with the piano.,JohntheCoyne,34,12,31,"I've been going through a bit of a pianist identity crisis. Let me explain.

So I've been playing piano for around 12 years now. I'm seventeen years old, being so involved with an instrument that it governs a lot of your thoughts. It's a really bizarre place to be in when you start thinking of chords in colors rather than names or scale degrees. But I digress.

In my school, and play a bunch of other instruments. Music can be a struggle, but it has been victorious until recently. To give you an idea of where I'm at on the instrument, I got a 100 (a perfect score) on [Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXQCPAR0EHo) a fairly challenging piece last year at NYSSMA (New York State Student Music Association) festival. Things went pretty well. Until this year.

It started last summer when I realized the flaws with my playing. My practice techniques and ethics are horrible. I accidentally skipped an entire measure of the Rach Prelude and still got a perfect score. I started thinking that the things that I'm very critical of go practically unnoticed by even NYSSMA judges. There were sections I didn't even learn the whole way through. You know when you have those few measures that you think ""Yeah, I would have a hard time going on through mistakes without fixing them. I chose the solo piano version of [Rhapsody in Blue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQVbL99qZGo) (I'm not sure if this is the right arrangement, but the difficulty is about the same). Lasting from 14-20 minutes long, Rhapsody in Blue is a piece to be reckoned with, but it is so incredibly beautiful.

This is where my problem started. I really loved the piece at the beginning. The first few pages were so enjoyable. They were hard, my enjoyment went down. There are sections of that piece that I've learned aren't playable by my hands. Maybe it's my piano, or something about my technique. But I've tried for so many hours at a few different sections and I can't do them. I've tried to eliminate ""can't"" from my vocabulary, but it has been 10 months since I started. I still can't play it. Granted, I haven't really worked at it in 5 months. To be honest, I haven't worked on anything in 5 months. I keep myself busy in other ways, but the last 5 months have been terrible on piano.

Every time I sit down to play the thing I used to love more than anything else in the world, don't get me wrong, but it's no Prelude in C# Minor. It's no Rhapsody in Blue. In the past, I've played Brubeck's Blue Rondo Alla Turk and my own arrangement of Bohemian Rhapsody. My song (and yes, it is a song. It has words. And I am playing it at a recital. Pitiful.) is worse than the one I played four years ago. Granted, the recital is comprised of Disney songs played by ten year olds, but this is just a terrible reflection upon who I am as a musician. Or is it? Actually

I was pretty secure in my aspiration to be a film composer for a few years. But now I don't know. I can't stand playing music most of the time. I have a lot of other interests that I would love to pursue

Maybe this is a rut. A 5 month rut. And hopefully I'll grow out of it.

My piano ability comes down to reading level 5-6 sheet music rather fluently. I can read level 7-8 sheet music as well but it will take me a bit of time to play it. I can't sight read anything beyond level 5, chords etc, I won't be able to pick up what chord or scale a particular measure was in by sight reading (I will only recognize it after it has been identified for me or I spend time to work it out).

I have found this tips:

---

* avoid unnecessary changes of hand position

* if it's possible then use finger crossing over / under while changing hand position

* if changing hand position is necessary then try to do it at the end of bar / phrase

* if changing hand position is necessary and if it's possible then try to use thumb as first finger in a next phrase

* use longer fingers (2

---

([source](https://www.webdepot.umontreal.ca/Usagers/belkina/MonDepotPublic/Piano/PianoTechnique.html#fingering))

* Try to organize fingering/shifts into rhythmically regular groups.

* Given a choice between fingerings which require many shifts or few

* The same musical pattern should usually be played with the same fingering

* Try to make shifts in both hands at the same time

---

([source](http://pianocheater.com/docs/practice/fingering.html))

* Watch the min and max range of notes for the section you're on

* For chord after chord after chord type sections

* If possible

---
([source](http://pianocheater.com/docs/practice/fingering.html) \ tips from ""Kreisler"" at [pianoworld.com](http://www.pianoworld.com/forum/) forums)

* move your whole hand to a new position rather than ""really really REALLY stretching"" fingers. But also try to minimize hand hops.

* try to use your strongest fingers for important notes: first thumb

* try to minimize thumbs and pinkies on black notes since they're short

* practice thumb under (and 2nd or 3rd over the thumb) for smooth legato melodies. For very very fast melodies

* pay special attention to smooth transitions between passages of the music

* DON'T bother with fingering the ""easy"" spots.  Clearer is better.

* if the finger doesn't move

* sometimes awkward fingering in an earlier passage ""sets up"" the start of the next passage

* determine fingering - BEFORE- practicing. You want your brain and fingers to remember ONE fingering. Not a couple variations swapped in and out randomly.

* know what notes are under your fingers so you DON'T HAVE TO LOOK DOWN. that's why we have black keys.  so the hand can always FEEL where it is.

* for chords

* if possible

* when extending to reach a ""way out there"" note
  You don't want to have to readjust gaps between the 4 fingers.

**Piano Jam #2 - Love**

With Valentine's Day approaching, maybe not the mysterious - almost haunting - Gnossienne #3, unless you see it representing the lost and lonely times in life when we wander aimlessly, wondering if there is any love for us at all... ... ... (I'm so deep). I'm not a huge 3/4 fan, but one thing I learned from this month's choices is that Love loves a good triple metre. Thanks again to everyone for [all the great suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/oycvi/piano_jam_reminder_planning_help_pick_next_months/)! I think there is a large enough backlog that I don't even need to ask for requests next month.

I'm 23, just in case anyone I know in real life finds out I'm even considering taking lessons.


I've taken approximately 3-4 years of piano lessons as a kid, I was afraid of my teachers, arrived late to class every week so that I could spend less time getting yelled at/told I sucked/having my fingers painfully pressed on the keys by the teacher etc. I eventually gave up in my fourth year, after my mom talked with the teachers several times (and offered to many more times, but I was so afraid of them I though they would exact revenge on me if I sent my mom) and nothing got better.

I liked playing though... But the lessons were terrible, said she liked when I played the piano. Although this was a compliment, I then realized anyone could still hear me even when our apartment was empty. And so I was done. I told my mom, who even offered to buy me a Clavinova so that I could practice with headphones on, but I was so discouraged I didn't want her to invest that much money in something I would give up on anyway.


A few years later, but quickly gave up (no teacher, no motivation, no nothing). Since then I've been longing to play but never found the motivation to get over my fears and try again. Until this year.

Last Christmas, I finally got the courage to say I wanted to play again. I've been playing since then (end of January/early February)... kind of. I learned a few songs, but quickly ran into problems when my wrists gave me so much pain I could barely type, let alone play. So I stopped playing for 3 months after having only played for 2. Now (as of the last few weeks) I'm back to playing again.

Throughout all of this, and even though he's completely supportive and expressed the desire to hear my music. I forced myself to play in front of him a few times (the first time I did he told me he was actually surprised because with all I said, he was expecting my level to be worse than it is), but it was **hard**. I also tried to record myself to send a video to my mom (she always regretted not having taken piano lessons as a kid and was sad and disappointed that I gave up when she gave me the opportunity she didn't have. I wanted to surprise her and show her I stuck with it), but this proved an impossible task. I was so stressed out that I gave up after maybe 40 tries on several different days, and never getting it right.

But... yeah. With all that, and lessons sound like they would be good for me because I feel like I've got no direction. I need some kind of guidance. I don't know what to play, and I want to discover songs, not play things I already know.

**TL;DR: Piano lessons as a kid were horrible

**Well

So, but would largely prefer classical music over pop songs).

With my previous experience with music schools, especially when I'm not so sure about the ad. **What should I look for in a teacher? Are there any red flags to avoid in ads? Are musical students any good at teaching, or should I look for a seasoned teacher?** (I typically ask a LOT of questions in class, and need someone who knows everything perfectly. I've been known to be a tough student for teachers who have gaps in their knowledge. I don't know if I will be the same with piano.)

I'm also afraid that they will force me to learn in a way I do not wish to. For instance, or stick with what they're used to?**

I'm also concerned because of my shitty 61 key keyboard. As a kid, old one too. The pedals were broken, so I never learned how to use them, and the keys sticked and were so grippy I couldn't slide my fingers on them, so it was always weird playing on the nice piano at the music school and my fingers always slipped on the ""slippery"" (normal) keys. I'm afraid it will be even worse with what I've got now. I'm looking to replace my keyboard with a weighted, 88 key one (the 61 keys are SO frustrating, I feel like I can't play *anything*), but I want to be sure first. Moreover

Lastly

I think it all boils down to this: **How can I find a teacher that will accept a student with so many problems?**

Edit: I forgot a question. Doctors have been stumped about my wrist/forearm pain (in both wrists, always when I used ""typing"" motions much (when I tried to get back to playing the keyboard in high school, when I played a lot of computer games, when I work on a computer). No CTS, no tenosynovitis, no inflammation, ""just take some painkillers and a muscle relaxant and see how it goes"". Did that ever happen to anyone here?

Hi everyone! Piano Jam is back! ...ummm, at least for a while, or at least put together by me. It feels like it's time to take a break and allow for something new to keep things fresh and exciting. We've had an amazingly great run -- about a year and a half, and the community participation has far exceeded any expectations I had. It has been so rewarding and so much fun. I look forward to helping organize some other /r/piano events in the future. Thanks for all your support and for sharing your talents with the community!

This month has selections spanning classical, ragtime, pop, and video game music. As always, the pieces span a range of skill levels and are usually fairly short. Hopefully there's something that piques your interest!

 I am starting to learn to play the piano. I spent ages reading on theory and history, and drive to get to the real issue - Practice, Practice, and more Practice.

 One of the issues I came up against is getting my mind recognize the various types of intervals and translate them immediately to my fingers without much conscious thought. i.e. simply put

 I have been focusing very strongly on this lately, and intervals, and knowing the positions, spacings and jumps, intuitively etc.  

 I started to make my own practice sheets with MuseScore

 I am picking up on all sorts of note intervals just from the stuff I am practicing, and covered all the bases by the time I finished those practice sheets. Perhaps even in a certain order from easiest to hardest (i.e. it's pretty easy to pick up a note on a space and a note on an adjacent line, harder to pick up on a fourth or an octave right away and even harder to spot a specific chord or one if it's inversions and so on).

*I personally consider acoustic pianos and digital keyboard separate instruments which are good at different things and the phrasing of the following questions reflects that.*

----

**Assuming you use both instruments regularly:**

* How do you use each instrument in your daily life?
* Do you prefer playing certain repertoire on one instrument over the other?
* What's the biggest advantage pianos have over keyboards for you personally?  Vice-versa?
* Did you pick the action of your keyboard based on the action of your piano?  Vice-versa?

**Assuming you only use one instrument regularly:**

* Piano or keyboard?
* Do you make a conscious choice to only a piano or only a keyboard?  Or are you limited by budget
* Do you find it hard to adapt when you're presented with a situation where the other instrument is available?
* Other thoughts?

The decoration of the piano is made up of a water gilded surface
The main challenge was to remove the substantial surface dirt that had collected on the two main lids and the upper surfaces during the piano’s lifetime (it was comissioned in 1856). There were also large areas of loss to the varnish on the lids where damage had occurred over time.

A few questions to get you started:

For those who teach:

1. How long have you taught piano?
2. What skill levels/ages do you teach?  What genres?
3. Why do you teach?
4. What are the best parts of teaching? What are the worst?
5. To teach is to learn.  What have you learned while teaching?

For those who do not teach:

1. Why don't you teach?
2. Do you plan to teach in the future? What's stopping you now?

Other thoughts about teaching?  Discuss!

Now I'm getting back into it over the past few months

Unfortunately I have fallen into a terrible habit. I pick up a song, then move on to another song, learn a page, then give up, essentially falling into a repeating pattern.

What is the best way for me to stick with a song? Would it be better just to pick up a VERY VERY EASY PIANO songbook and learn 50 easy songs before attempting to play a typical pop/alternative song or a movie score?

Any book recommendations is much appreciated, but I want to play (and finish) some songs!",,False,self,t5_2qnw8,False,,
