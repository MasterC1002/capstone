It appears to be all the songs from Rockband

I only ask beforehand because I'll have to figure out a place to host it (probably Google Drive or something) and take the time to upload it - so I just want to see if there's interest.

Cheers Drummit!

EDIT: Please upvote if you're interested. Not for my karma's sake (it's a self post) but to make sure it gets as many eyes as possible. Thanks!

EDIT: Ok so there's obviously a huge demand for this. I'm really stoked that I can hook so many people up with this! I wasn't sure if it was just old news or whatever. I know it has been such a pleasure to drum with for me.

SO - I'm just at work right now and the files are on my computer at home. **As soon as I get home** I'll figure out the best way to upload everything and then I'll post up a link as soon as humanly possible.

Thanks for all the feedback drummiters!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWEST EDIT:Ok,300 songs :p) and I don't have a ton of options for uploading this beast in a way that will be easy for everyone to grab.

I want to break them into smaller folders

Anyway

Just a little teaser for the time-being: [Here's the list I exported of all the files.](http://nickp.ca/RrNGFv) Sorry

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINAL FUCKING EDIT:**

Well shit. After all this pain and anguish

So there you have it

Sorry folks :(

Before you even think about hitting record, great gear doesn't necessarily mean great sound.

Never underestimate the importance of how you tune your drums. A mediocre kit with nice heads, (which is linked on this subreddit) is a great place to start.

Clean your cymbals! Clean, preference is a factor. Sometimes it is desirable to have duller, softer sounding cymbals, (some are made that way).

Other consideration that need to be made are:

* The Room
* Microphone Position
* Microphone Choice (If you have the option)

As a general rule, it's the difference between a 'good' and a 'great' sound. The remaining 50% of overall sound quality is the player, and the kit itself, (as discussed above).

**Miking Techniques:**

Stereo Miking.

Stereo miking = two microphones in different places, i.e. same sound, similar volume. The following are some examples of stereo miking -

* [Spaced pair technique](http://i.imgur.com/WBJIaKC.jpg) (A-B):

This is when two microphones are placed parallel to each other, if your stereo pair is 1 meter from the sound source, your mics must be 3 meters apart. Either cardioid or omnidirectional mics would typically be used for this technique.

* [X-Y Technique](http://i.imgur.com/d3stmx6.jpg):

For X-Y, but you're are far less likely to run into any phasing issues. X-Y produces a good centre image.

**Some other Stereo Miking Techniques** which I will list and let you research yourself:

* [MS (Mid-Side) Technique](http://www.haydenloft.com/Home/techniques_files/mid_side.php) - (My personal favourite but by far the most complicated)
* [Blumlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumlein_Pair)
* [NOS stereo technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOS_stereo_technique)
* [ORTF stereo technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORTF_stereo_technique)
* [Binaural technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording)

All of the above techniques can be used for 'Room Miking' - which are ambient microphones positioned in front of the kit that can later be blended with other drum tracks to give an additional 'room feel'. This can be subjective to processing without affecting the overall drum presence. Distance to the drum kit is quite critical and will require some experimenting - (the 'whichever sounds best' rule).

**Ambient or close-miking?**

* Ambient recording with spot mics will retain the stereo image and natural ambiance of the kit
* Close-miking will result in more flexibility during mixdown

**Miking the kit:**

* Overheads:

Overheads are the best place to asses the kit and get the drum sound you're after. Use either A-B (between 60cm - 130cm apart)

* Kick Drum:

Dynamic mics with a large diaphragm, more present sound, whereas outside the kick drum will result in a more ambient sound. If I have the option I will always do both, giving me the ability to blend the two signals and produce a fatter sound. Resonance of the drum will need to be dampened by a cushion(s) or similar. Beware of squeaky foot pedals.

* Snare:

A mic on the top head is going to give you the punch and a mic on the bottom will give you rattle. Keep in mind that if you have both a top and bottom mic, make use of the [proximity effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_effect_%28audio%29) by moving the mic closer to the skin. Make sure the bottom mic is also off-axis to the kick for the same reason. Typical mics used on snare would be a [Shure SM57](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm57-instrument-microphone) or [BETA 57A](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-57a-instrument-microphone) - any dynamic vocal mic will work on the bottom head.

* Toms:

Toms are almost always going to have a mic on the top head. A bottom mic can be added but it will be very phase sensitive and generally lacks the clarity of a single top mic. Be sure to never aim a mic directly at a piece of dampening. The classical method of placement is to have the mic about 5cm/2 inches off the head above the rim

* Hats:

Hihats will often cut through into the other mics which is pretty unavoidable, the typical placement would be angle the mic at about 45 - 90 degrees to the hats, aimed at the edge of the cymbal for a shimmering sound, and at the bell for a harder sound. Position the mic so it is shielded from the snare and off-axis to the toms. A trusty Shure SM57 is also an acceptable mic to use on hats.

* Ride:

Your overheads should be sufficient to capture the ride

**Conclusion:**

I really can't stress the listening test enough. *Never* be satisfied with just placing a mic and assuming it will sound good. No matter how good you think it sounds

Not everyone will have access to the large number of inputs/microphones necessary for a full-scale kit mic-up

I am happy to answer any more questions you may have regarding miking up drums

2. Drummit members have one week to apply the rudiment to the kit in a creative and musical way and upload a video of them playing to the sub.
3. A winner is decided at the end of the week through the mighty power of the upvote.

What do you win?  The awe and admiration of the drummit community and the knowledge that you've inspired us all to continue honing our skills.

I was chatting with a guy about this in the top post on drummit about the Super Bowl drummer. I was told I was being sexist. You know what's REALLY sexist? Paying more attention to a drummer just because she's female. I don't think a lot of people understand this seemingly reverse sexism thing. They think watching female drummers is doing some sort of justice to society when really

I never once said that a drummer who is male is automatically better

Am I just ranting? I guess.. Thoughts please.

Edit: lots of people are saying things along the lines of ""she's doing what she loves

The fact that she is doing what she loves is great. That in and of itself does not piss me off. I'm glad she gets paid to do what she loves, I'm not asking for people to watch me. I'm pissed because there are hundreds, if not thousands of great drummers going unnoticed because they don't have tits. If you are a drummer or musician and you have dreams, if that doesn't piss you off then I don't know what will.

1370249143.0,1fkkk5,Wisdom for the aspiring professional drummer,rpdrums,116,10,16,"Here is some wisdom I have gained in my relatively short 9 years of playing:


**1.) Practice with a metronome (whenever possible) at varying tempos:**

It is of the utmost importance that you dedicate part of your practice time to playing very slowly. This will help you to ""program"" your limbs through muscle memory and encourage good technique. This allows you to play with confidence and as little tension as possible when you speed up.

It is helpful to set tempo goals for any practice material


**2.) Establishing Good Fundamental Technique:**

Good technique will save your equipment

You are developing your ""sound"" and ""feel"" on your instrument


**3.) Reading

Music is a language. You should be both musically literate


**4.) Be organized

Track your progress. Keep a spiral notebook for your practice routines to ensure that you are putting in adequate time to things you want to learn

When you practice, and possibly even bridges burned resulting in less gigs in the future.

Also


**5.) Be yourself (that's what's really cool...) and save your $$$!**

When you interact with real

Stay healthy and avoid hard drugs
I know everyone has their own demons they must battle, let's be realistic: you cannot afford these things.

...and speaking of affording things. Have you ever noticed how expensive drum gear is? As a professional drummer you will be expected to have reliable


Here are some practice materials that have helped me immensely:

**General Tips (;TLDR):**

Join your H.S. or a C.C. band
Join a band
Practice everyday no matter how you feel
Save your $$; this will shit will get expensive
YOUTUBE IS YOUR FRIEND
Discipline is an acquired skill: cultivate it through practice
Maintain good social relationships

Stretch
Love life

Hopefully some of you will find this helpful! If you have anything to add please do! We drummers need to stick together!

I love you /r/drums!

1350865847.0,11vbp4,Living quietly as a drummer- Playing an electronic drumset that feels and acts like an acoustic,TitoJones,114,16,46,"

I grew up in Las Vegas




To play with a band we had to rent hourly studios or sign a lease with a full lock out building far away and share it with other bands. All expensive and required lots of travel.
I solved this by purchasing a small entry line Roland V- Drum kit



The kit was nice


I decided that playing a small V-drum kit was getting me into some bad habits when I'd play live with a real kit so I did the next best thing. I converted my DW kit to be like a Roland V-drum kit with mesh heads



The goal was to keep my acoustic Drum Workshop kit in my apartment, mesh heads, electronic cymbals, and finally some type of headphone hub we could all get the instruments into and hear with. 



So I ordered everything from RMC Audio; tAt the time of this write up the 14"" Roland mesh heads were on back order. I had decided to upgrade to a Roland TD-12 with all roland cymbals; CY-15 ride (x1), and VH-12 hi-hats.




Anyways; here is my progress through the conversion.



Here is the 4 pc Drum Workshop kit I'm starting with. There is a 22"" bass drum, and solid bronze DW 14"" snare.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/htszL.jpg)



All the items I've purchased from this conversion came from RMC Audio; They were fast

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/8Pxxb.jpg)


I decided to start with the bass drum.
Here we have 1 Hart 22"" mesh head
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/PixTU.jpg)



I started by removing both the batter and logo heads
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/t2rto.jpg)



While everything was apart I tightened and checked all the hardware.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/xGUF5.jpg)



I then re-installed the front DW logo head and made sure to orientate the hoop so the split in the wrap would be on the bottom so it wouldn't show when the kit was assembled.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3JQJm.jpg)



Next up I re-installed the foam muffle for the front head and to help make the mesh head less bouncy. 
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/A82Bd.jpg)



Now for the Hart Dynamics 22"" mesh head installation; again I made sure to orientate the head and hoop so they would be aesthetically pleasing when set up to play.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nfc4U.jpg)



Installing the RT-10K trigger and setting the trigger height was next. The package includes the single zone trigger
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/q71fW.jpg)



I decided to mount the trigger on the bottom right to make sure there was no interference from the double bass pedal or linkage. I peeled the plastic off the clear hoop protectors and installed them on both sides of the hoop in my desired install spot.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/stJCu.jpg)



To install the RT-10K trigger you must loosen the mount all the way and use a drum key to loosen the trigger depth mount. Just install over the hoop and tighten the trigger.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/xjcwa.jpg)



You want the piezzo cone to be compressed 2-3mm when installed. You just push down slightly right in front of the cone and then tighten the mount while you leave your finger there. Release and watch the cone compress slightly. You are now done and can install the cable and setup your module.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mDakv.jpg)
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/DzLAM.jpg)



Here is the 12"" DW suspended tom
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/pyFpI.jpg)



The process is the same for all of this stuff. Remove the old acoustic heads, install mesh heads, and trigger.



[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/XLm6F.jpg)

16"" suspended DW floor tom was up next. These are a pair of Hart Dynamics 16"" heads
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/tLmAm.jpg)



The finished product:

Electric:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/XcBQa.jpg)



To get it to this point I had to special order a DW remote cable hi hat bracket and mount to hang off the hi hat stand for the TD-12 module. It all works incredibly well once you spend time getting the head tension



Once the conversion was finished we needed a way to all play together in silence in my apartment. I came across a product called the Jamhub. (We use the Greenroom version)
http://jamhub.com/products/greenroom.html
(These days we play at my guitarist’s house in his converted garage.)


It’s a silent rehearsal studio. 
What it does is take inputs from up to 6 different instruments and allow each user to have their own headphone mix of the entire band. If I want less bass I dial it back in my mix. If I want to hear mostly me



The device is really quite genius. 



When we do end up playing a show I just swap heads and trade out cymbals and I’m ready for a gig. About 1 hr to swap to an acoustic kit
Here is my kit being set up at the Blizzard Entertainment 2012 Blizz Summerfest stage by a pro stage hand.
Acoustic:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/pqyWZ.jpg)AA



The other bonus about playing electronically through the jamhub is grabbing a recorded practice with high sound quality through one of the 6 channels. We are a 3 pc instrumental band that plays post-surf rock and only need 3 of the 6 channels; we put put 1 to a HN4 recording device



Here is one of our songs; The band is called The Ghosts of Searchlight
Jamhub:
http://soundcloud.com/ovalteens/shadowpoint-20120531
Live:
http://soundcloud.com/ovalteens/2012-blizz-summerfest-16-weeks



The first version is us practicing the song at home through the jamhub and using the electric drums



Hope this helps some of you wondering how you can live quietly as a drummer.

For those of you who don't know how Rock Band works, Bass, Guitar, and Keyboards.  When you fail to hit the corresponding note on the screen; the audio doesn't play for that note on your track.

Here's how RockBand is awesome.  (All of this is for Rock Band 3

* In the pause menu

* Disconnect the audio-out cable from your TV and plug it into the ""audio in"" port or microphone port on your computer.  You will most likely need an RCA-3.5mm adapter to do this.

* Open up an audio recording program.  I use [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), and works great.

* Start recording.

*  Start the song on RockBand

* When the song's over, and save to MP3.

* Play songs on headphones or stereo and jam away!

**Kit** is a 1968 Rogers kit. (Much like Darren King's, 16""x16"" floor, 12""x8"" rack.

**Snare** is a 1967 Ludwig Acrolite. Keystone badge. Fantastic all around snare. I have a home-built stave 13""x6.75"" on the way. Most of you have seen it.

**Hardware** is mostly DW, haha. If anybody knows a good place to find an oriental style rug for cheap, hit me up!

**Cymbals** left to right:
Meinl Byzance 14"" Extra Dry Medium Hats
Meinl Byzance 20"" Traditional Extra Thin Hammered Crash
Meinl Byzance 22"" Vintage Sand Ride
Meinl Byzance 21"" Traditional Medium Crash
Meinl Byzance 20"" Extra Dry Thin Crash

I told him I was looking for new cymbals and he basically went though a lot of the products and he also explained that the reason some of the cymbals they have are so pricey is because of their tin content ( why b8's are called b8 due to the 8% tin content) and thus producing darker sounds. overall we talked for about ten minuets on our favorite cymbals and which ones he used and why,False,
