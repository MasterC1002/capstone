We've been struggling with performance on our medum size (80vm's

Our problem has been with ""Citrix is slow"" or ""Servers are slow"" several times a week during peak loads.

I've pulled my hair out learning and fixing every problem in our vmware environment (var and ""professional services"" f'd our install so bad it's criminal"" and our EMC san iscsi back end.

Cpu %ready with vproc scheduling problems, all .vmdks on the same LUN, etc, etc.

I couldn't read books and manuals and best practice shit fast enough. And of course, three helpdesk guys that barely can fix printers, and me.  

I basically keep at cot in my office I'm there so much.  Lately it's been so bad with Citrix users pissed off with ""slowness"" (our whole farm is virtualized) I walk into my office expecting the HR guys standing there every day to fire me.  All the professional contractor vmware expert contractor companies' guys knew less than I do when I call trying to get any kind of help.

On a whim I downloaded the vkernel .ovf monitoring tool.

H O L Y      S H I T.

Everything. Every issue, or would you like to schedule it fixed tonight?"" options.

Turns out that not only did we have iscsi pathing problems which were bottlenecking access to the san backend

I know this sounds like I'm a retard and maybe I am (then again, CCNP, so can hold my own in a pinch usually) but when you're stressed and busy and the world's crashing down and you have no help, and are too busy keeping things running to ever get formal vmware training, it's damned tough to connect the esxtop dots, and wade through an avalanche of conflicting thousand page ""best practice"" docs.

I had our vmware environment completely fixed in one day. One day. Eight hours. Two years of f'd vmware/san

Downvote this if you want, and I know some of you are, then give it a try. Maybe it'll save your job too.

I arrived about 1/2 hour early and they let me sit the exam early which was nice as I was really stressing out.

They are very secure about who they let in.  I had to fill out a form that I have read the rules

I answered the survey questions as best as I could and the exam started right after that.  Some questions (very few) were easy

You can make sure you didn't miss any after you get to question 85 by hitting a review button.  It will tell you if you missed any questions (skipped by accident I assume) or if you only picked 2 answers when you needed to pick 3.  You can also mark specific questions you are unsure about to review later.

After the review process I clicked end and the system asked me twice if I was sure that I wanted to end as there was no going back after.

The pass/fail screen pops up and tells you what the score is and if you passed or failed and that a print out would be given to you when you leave.

I passed!

I am now going to relax the rest of the day and have a beer or two.

1366851248.0,1d1ti4,About to virtualize SQL Server and want some advice,sfcg,28,4,27,"I'm knee deep in docs right now

A bit about the environment:

4 SQL servers on mixed Dell hardware. Most recent is an R720.
Attached to Gigabit iscsi SAN over gigabit switches.
Multipath and jumbo frames enabled
LUNS on 8-10 spindles of 10K SAS per volume (shared with out of use SQL server that is being rebuilt. Can still cause a bit of contention when data is being copied)
All DB's are Stage or QA servers
Needs 40+GB of memory (within SQL) - current servers have 64-128GB and are fine.
IO average of about 2000-3500 IOPs


My question is this. What specifically should I look out for? Pitfalls with configuration of SQL, what did you wish you knew after virtualizing SQL that you didn't know before?

I've only used ESXi (free version) and only very recently installed ESXi 5, but want to put these on a paid version of ESX so I can leverage more advanced features and can be more flexible with these servers in specific. Does it make sense to pool with only two servers like this?

Some specific things I'm concerned about:

1) NUMA configuration - After reading about this

2) Drive configuration - We use mutipath iscsi to a pair of Dell MD3220i SAN's. How does this translate if I want to use VMFS and what does the host see if I'm not using MS iscsi initiator? Do I have to buy Enterprise version to get this option

3) Large Pages - What is this and why?

4) Hardware optimization - What are my options? I don't know much about this. We are a Dell shop.

I have so many questions bouncing around in my head, but this is a pretty large change, and we've been having trouble with some of our older SQL servers, so I don't want to put anything in place that will perform worse. I also have very little time to implement.

Thanks

Re:  Australian VMWare Workstation 9 upgrade pricing


Dear Sirs &amp; Ms. James


I was pleased to recently receive an invitation to upgrade from VMWare Workstation 8 to release 9.  As this is a tool I use everyday and find quite valuable for my productivity I am keen to proceed with the upgrade.


I did however have two questions relating to the upgrade pricing of the release in Australia that I feel should be directed to the board:


Q1.  Why is the US price for the upgrade US$119 and the Australian price AU$174.50 when the exchange rate is approximately AU$1 = US$1.0376 (as of this writing)?

Q2.  Are you aware that on 24 May 2012 the Australian Federal Government House Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications resolved to inquire into IT price discrimination, Senator Stephen Conroy?  (refer: http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=ic/itpricing/index.htm)

While I am interested in the new features of this release


Regards


Mike Smith

I've been working with VMware products a long time. i hold their server virtualisation products in very high regard and actively promote them. i like view and have implemented it

However, which are hosted on windows/SQL2008R2. Due to bugs, an awful interface and general clunkiness, it has resulted in vCenter being down more than if we had just left it alone supported by regular HA.

We've had multiple occurrences of heartbeat causing issues. One particular bug filled up a tomcat log file full of superfluous information very quickly and fill the entire C: disk on vCenter, vCenter to go down, and not fail over to the secondary because that disk was a replication target, and had filled also. awesome right? yes, that disk space should have been monitored more closely. but thats besides the point. heartbeat, the very thing that is supposed to protect vCenter, killed it.

today

So we lost a network connection on an entire blade chassis. one connection out of two

Except, dies... how? why? because BOTH database servers (also ""protected"" by heartbeat), have somehow stopped all of their services, including the actual heartbeat service. That sure is odd. So when i restarted heartbeat, it will not, for the life of itself find a way to start the database services on either node. exasperated, i try and start them manually , there's nothing wrong with it. Now

so, i think it's rubbish, particularly considering the licensing cost. I REALLY hope that VMware are working towards a better solution for people who need highly available vCenters.

Just wanted to throw out some thoughts on the intricacies of configuring RAID-10 sets for VMFS-5 datastores (the filesystem of VMware ESXi 5.1 servers)

##The setup:
* PERC 6/i RAID controller
* Eight 1TB 7
* VMFS-5 file system
* ESX 5.1 on an internal SD card

We've been building a number of standalone ESX hosts lately

For the purposes of this post

## My assumptions:
* In an 8-drive RAID 10 array
* In a VMFS-5 filesystem
* In a RAID setup
* Anticipated use-case drives stripe/block decisions

To me, and guest VM's filesystem blocksize such that they work together for the best performance.

I ran this one-liner to get the average size of all files on our two bare-metal CentOS file servers (which will eventually migrate onto the ESX platform):

    find / -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l | gawk '{sum += $5; n++;} END {print ""Total Size: "" sum/1024/1024 "" MB : Avg Size: "" sum/n/1024 "" KB : Total Files: "" n ;}'

The results were 615 KB and 98 MB

Because most of our files are far bigger than the default 64KB stripe size on most RAID controllers, etc), I decided a larger stripe size is better. This way large files won't get broken into as many pieces, but still get broken into enough pieces to get the benefit of striping.

I decided *against* a 1024 KB (1MB) stripe size, which is one of the scenarios we want to avoid.

I decided on a 256 KB stripe size based on this calculation:

    4 spindles / 1 MB blocks = 256 KB stripes

To my understanding, so all 4 drives can work on a block simultaneously.

## My conclusions:
Based on the above information

* 256 KB stripe size on the array (4 drives/1MB blocks=256 stripes)
* Write-back on the controller
* Adaptive read-ahead on the controller
* 4 KB blocksize on Guest VM's *OS* partition (lots of little files)
* 1024 KB blocksize on Guest VM's file serving and ""big data storage"" partitions (lots of big files)

Can anyone offer any thoughts? Am I completely off base on this?

I’m familiar with the basic concepts of virtualization having used Parallels for several years.  However, Security+, and MCTS Win7 certified and I’m now studying for the coveted MCITP Server 2008 Admin cert. (which in my area seems to be a hard requirement for a network admin position)

The labs in the MS training material (which my folks got me for Christmas) recommends a lab setup that allows 4 instances of MS Server 2008 R2 to be run simultaneously.

So… for my home lab purposes I created a HP Server with Dual Xeon 3.4GHz processors
I THINK that VMWare Server is going to accomplish what I’m after.  I downloaded VMWare VSPhere Hypeversior ESXi 4.1 and burned the ISO to disc.  I installed and configured it on the server, etc.

So

* 1.	I have a Windows7 64bit based desktop that is connected via the network to the (now) dedicated VMware server.  If I install VMWare client do I ever have to install a host OS to the dedicated HP VMWare server box?  Can’t I just run everything from the Win7 desktop?  (ie create new VM’s
* 2.	If using the configuration detailed in #1 will I be able to run simultaneous instances of different VM’s?
* 3.	Does the client PC (the Win7 desktop) have to be running
* 4.	Am I approaching this the wrong way?  What I need is:
* a.	4 running VM’s of Server 2008 R2 that I can switch back and forth and utilize

In HP Command View we can present a LUN to multiple host initiators. In this way the LUN (disk) is presented to both HA nodes in a VMWare cluster.

ESX1 and ESX2 both need to have the same LUN presented to them in order to ""see"" the datastores in order to bring up the VMs.

The problem comes in when on the ZFS interface as there is no way to have multiple presentations of a LUN. The initiator groups configured on the ZFS are (ESX1.a/b &lt;--&gt;ZFS) and (ESX2.a/b &lt;--&gt;ZFS)

Data is too big for the physical machine's storage

The client has purchased a QNAP TS-669 Pro NAS with 6x 3TB disks

My question is simple: what's the best way to configure this?

I am initially thinking of this:  
  


1) mapping the NAS to the hosts via iSCSI as one huge lun (RAID 6 rather than 10? also not sure if I should use multiple luns/targets on the NAS). 

2) creating a Windows VM and attaching it a VMDK the size of the entire NAS datastore to it

3) making the VM a Veeam proxy/repository so it can hot add VMDK disks to itself and write directly to the VMDK on the NAS lun

4) sharing the VMDK on the NAS lun via Windows to allow the physical machine with the tape drive to backup the Veeam files over the network   
  
  
I pretty much have free reign over how to configure everything involved. If I need to change something I can. However I'm not overly familiar with this stuff

  
Edit: I should point out it's ESXi 5.0 and a SAS tape drive that we're unable to add to hosts. Veeam is v6.1 currently with support expired

Pretty pictures:

[front](http://i.imgur.com/ipcjs.jpg)

[back](http://i.imgur.com/ojuvs.jpg)

[switch](http://i.imgur.com/SrVxb.jpg)

I ended up mostly taking everybody's advice.  I built two complete ESXi/FreeNAS setups

I went with the same case on all four of these.  It's a cheap but serviceable 3U rackmount from Newegg (sourced nearly everything from them - obvious shill links below).  My single biggest mistake was purchasing the wrong motherboard for the backup ESXi server - ESXi doesn't support the built-in Ethernet controller (82579v).  I thought I was boned

So...so far, of course, the tables are turned, and R2 is running on ESXi.

Are the VMs fast?  Some are, is anything running noticeably slower than when it was a physical machine.  All 4 VMs are humming along on a single Sandy Bridge Xeon

For backups, and it works (although it's a little slow).

I went with server-class mobos for both primary servers.  This is a little overkill for the FreeNAS box, the primary FreeNAS is running RAIDz2 with 4 1TB drives, so I have an extremely fault-tolerant system with just under 2 TB of usable space (all of which I gave over to the VMware iSCSI extent).  Against all advice I was able to gather, my practical testing revealed that the regular extent is faster than the device extent, so that's what I'm using.

The buildout cost just over $4K.

So...what next?  Both ESXi servers are the free version.  Is it worthwhile to buy a VMware license of some kind?  Why or why not?  I know HA is a bonus

I decided to fix this issue and consolidate down to just a solid block of 10 ip addresses and when I did so, saving it, and restarting the vpx agent the old incorrect ip address would keep populating. This meant that sVMotions would not work from this host. Fortunately the last step in the article fixed the issue.

Interesting Symptoms:

* Only sVMotion seemed to be affected. Cloning and deploying from template worked fine.
* Virtual machines could be VMotioned off of this host and sVMotioned on other ESX hosts. 
* The vpx agent would respond to the new ip address 192.168.0.107 as well as 192.168.0.108. Again this only seemed to impact sVMotion which is really strange.

1319761602.0,lrm91,Need Help Pitching Virtualization Cost/Benefit To Boss,orty,11,0,42,"First off

I have a half-rack full of PIII-era proliant servers ([see my CablePorn post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/comments/lr9yl/slowly_cleaning_up_my_rack_vintage_porn_alert/)) that I'd like to consolidate and virtualize. They're all Windows Server 2000 (minus one that is Windows 2003). I could easily do them all with one solid box

I'm trying to come up with a proposal to pitch to my boss to consolidate all the PIII-era servers (except my firewall) into a single box. A few questions:

1. What kind of minimum CPU/RAM/other specs am I looking at to run this stuff reliably? Out of the three servers I'm wanting to replace, at most, so I could probably do it all on a single server with a bunch of drives running a large raid array or two. How much should I expect to spend?

2. Obviously, and a new server would have to have redundant power supplies but consume less power than all those (I would assume). Any place I could roughly calculate that out? Any other cost benefits I can throw out there to them? My biggest thing is being able to have an image I can get back up and running on another system quickly and easily, should the baremetal of the main system go caput. While I have spare parts for all my old systems, it'd be nice if I could get something that's been made in the last decade ;-)

3. Is there a good and easy way to convert live Windows 2000 installs to images easily? I'm seen converters for Windows 2003 and above

4. Looking at what's out there, my needs aren't huge, but I want something that is fairly easy to use/manage once it's all setup and running. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, and have managed several Linux machines via command line, but since I know squat about this stuff compared to a lot of other tech, I want to make sure my ducks are in a row :-)

It appears the esxi host (not 5.1!) does not support SIOC and i'm not sure if that applies to DAS.

The problem I believe is that Esxi is trying to do fair scheduling of disk i/o but it's not giving thought for monstrous SSD bandwidth. 

We're talking 10x-100x faster disk i/o with a single VM on the host versus 2 more idle.

I read the queue lengths here and noticed the 1078 adapter queue is never getting any action. the Fastpath option of the LSI controller is a system that throttles QD1 and coalesces writes to force SSD into it's higher performing high queue depth somehow.

What i'd like (without SIOC) is to be able to let a VM to have a deeper queue. Since its DAS

Normally with a hard drive setup you might think this is crazy but when you have only one VM guest

If I have 4 vm's

I've heard using PVSCSI allows you to alter the OS queue depth to 255 (?? crazy ??).

I'm pretty familiar with most vmware concepts and am looking for some recommendations/best practices for setting up the networking on my 3 ESX hosts. It gets confusing sometimes and I'm hoping the reddit community can lend a hand. 

I currently have vSphere 5 Essentials installed on 3 Hosts with 4 NICs in each host. We are a pretty small shop (100 employees

1. Can I team two adapters on each host for the VM's to use to talk to the rest of the network?

2. Should I dedicate one NIC in each host for management?

3. For the final NIC I was going to have that dedicated to backup the VM's to our Datto device.

4. From this main switch I have a gigabit link to another switch that all our desktops are plugged into. Is this link a bottleneck?

It started with a few people asking some *more* questions to the Cisco guy, but then got into some VMware stuff.  I can't remember the questions, but at one point they quieted down, so the group up the front went to one of the ones they said they've been asked before.  They threw it up on the screen (it was RDMs vs VMDKs, I think.. can't remember) and that started another 10 minutes of hardcore VMware storage discussion

Therefore

Here is how I did it.

Download the patches for ESXi4.1 Embedded and Installable from
http://www.vmware.com/patch/download/
There are two at the time of posting this.

ESXi410-201010001 - Posted 15th Nov 2010

and

ESXi410-201011001 - Posted 29th Nov 2010

Download the CLI which at time of writing was posted 13th Jul 2010
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vcli/

It is best to re-boot once the cli installed

Copy the two patches above from your downloaded location to this directory

C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware vSphere CLI\bin

Now open the CLI and browse to the bin directory

C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware vSphere CLI\bin&gt;

The process is thus;

You need to list each update and then apply each bulletin contained within the update.  You don't need to re-boot the host until you have applied all your updates.

Let us assume

Connect via the vSphere client

Open the CLI at C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware vSphere CLI\bin&gt; and type

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 --username root --password redditvmware -b ESXi410-201010001.zip -l

The above will list the bulletins contained within

Now apply the bulletins to patch the host

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 -i -b ESXi410-201010001.zip -B ESXi410-201010401-SG

You will be prompted for Username and Password and the update will apply.

Now apply the second bulletin for VMTools

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 -i -b ESXi410-201010001.zip -B ESXi410-201010402-BG

You will again be prompted for Username and Password and the update will apply.

Now list the second update (as of Reddit Posting date 14th Jan 2011)

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 --username root --password redditvmware -b ESXi410-201011001.zip -l

and patch the bulletin contained within

&gt;perl vihostupdate.pl --server 192.168.1.10 -i -b ESXi410-201011001.zip -B ESXi410-201011401-BG

Now you can re-boot the host and Exit Maintenance mode on start up.
Your ESXi 4.1 Host is patched.

* A) Reinstall ESXi.

At that point, all should be running again.  Is this accurate?  Is this reliable?

* B) Attempt to ""hack"" the system.  The comments on [this page](http://vm-help.com/esx/esx3i/Reset_root_password.php) seem to indicate that while this is an older procedure, this method intimidates me a little!

* C) Community option!  Is there some magic bullet that Google didn't reveal?

1368395548.0,1e7f79,Bit of a curly one - Restored vCenter server (vm) not loading NIC drivers,jimmcfartypants,9,2,21,"I struck this again recently. We use Veeam and there's a known issue where CTK files might not be removed if a backup or replication job fails. The end result is a VM that has loads of snapshots associated with it and no means of them being removed. Veeam does have some recommendations for clearing these but they didn't work in our instance so we reverted to a backup since the vc database is hosted elsewhere.

The restore was fine however when powering on the server for the first time the server didn't appear to have network drivers installed and as such didn't show a working NIC. IF you tried to access the NIC settings within the OS (2008R2) it would just show a blank window.

No problem I thought. I'll just remove and re-add the NIC on the VM settings, it wouldn't let me re-install that either the server would just sit idle. Essentially I had a VM that couldn't have a NIC. 

As it turned out the NIC was installed (despite the drivers missing from device manager and the network settings being inaccessible within Windows) and needed to have the IP settings added again via cmd line. Only then did everything start to work. As far as I can tell this has only happened with vcenter VM's that have been restored.

I'd be curious to know if anyone else has hit this. 

TL;DR - restored vCenter server VM needs to have IP settings re-added via command line for no apparent reason. OS seems completely stuffed up as control panel windows won't open etc until IP settings are corrected.

**Edit for anyone from the future:**

This issue is to do with VMXNET3. Install [this patch](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2526142) before you restore the VM",self,t5_2qnan,1369005829.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/1e7f79/bit_of_a_curly_one_restored_vcenter_server_vm_not/

  I have a number of LUNs configured for a particular client. Three LUNs with different sizes host 50 VMs. These VMs can be anything from Web

  The plan for the moment is to empty out the smaller LUN into the next biggest LUN. Delete that LUN and recreate it with the proper size and then move VMs back. Since there is enough disk space between three

  The question I have for the group is:

* How much overhead is necessary for a VM in order to size the LUN?
* Is there a VM to LUN ratio out there to figure out how many VMs I should store in a single LUN?

1356008371.0,155ynp,"Backup Software, vRDMs, and CBT.",Khue,13,5

I am using HP Data Protector and after talking with Data Protector they are certain that incremental backups should be supported on vRDMs. I pinged VMware about it and they said that cbt is available for vRDMs and they pointed me at [this article](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1020128).

Why am I asking these questions? Well we elected to put one of our main applications on a vRDM. The drive we placed on the vRDM is a 1.5 terabyte image drive that stores millions of small tif images. I ran a full backup (which took approximately 10 hours) which ended up being 1.5 terabytes as expected. I then immediately followed the full with an incremental (that took 10 hours as well) and it too was also 1.5 terabytes. 

I checked the normal things:

* **Is incremental backup working at all in the environment?** Yes. VMDK files seem to be incrementally backing up.
* **Is incremental backup working on the other drives for the virtual machine in question?** Yes
* **Do you see the ctk file corresponding to the vRDM?** Yes. My vRDM (the pointer at least) is labeled server03_2.vmdk and the cbt file is labeled server03_2-ctk.vmdk and it's approximately 6
* **Can you get change block tracking on a vRDM to work elsewhere in the environment?** No. I setup a quick demo on a 10 gig vRDM on a test PC and it's not working there either. 

I would appreciate hearing some other's thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.

**Edit:** Down vote out the gate? Why?

**Edit2:** Just a little update. So apparently it looks like ESXi, there apparently wasn't any information being actually tracked inside of them. I spoke with VMware and they've forwarded the ticket over to the SDK group and they are going to look into the VDDK and figure out what's going on.

protector using MOB ( http://&lt;your virtual center&gt;/mob):
1- First get the change information
    content -&gt; ha-folder-root -&gt; ha-datacenter -&gt; datastore -&gt; vm -&gt; snapshot -&gt; config -&gt; hardware &gt; virtualDisk.
  Notice that Changed block tracking is associated with the snapshot

&gt; 2- 
   a- use the procedure described in the follwng kb to access the virtual machine:
         http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1017126
   b- Once in the page called :
          Managed Object Type: ManagedObjectReference:VirtualMachine 
          Managed Object ID: vm-xxx
      click on ""QueryChangedDiskAreas"" link to open the QueryChangedDiskAreas() API invocation  page.

&gt;    c- use the information collected in step 1 to  fill out the API argument

&gt; If you need more detail on how the work can be found in the following link:
    http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-50/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vddk.pg.doc_50%2FvddkBkupVadp.9.3.html
    section: ""Changed Block Tracking on Virtual Disks""

&gt; Please notice also that there is a known QueryChangedDiskAreas() API defect (Vmware side):
   http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2039052
where QueryChangedDiskAreas call incorrectly returns the entire thin-provisioned disk!!

&gt; As you can see the problem seems to be in Vmware side
A better procedure to demonstrate the problem outside Data protector.

The system was replaced with a different system a very long time ago but the people in charge of that department need to retain the system for some time for record keeping but for reasons out of my control the old P.SQL data will never be migrated to the new MSSQL based system. So I am just keeping it alive until it is no longer needed.

So my thought was to emulate the old server in a VM. I am not very familiar with VMware and really this is going to be my first time playing with it. I just downloaded vsphere and I could use lots of advice. One big question is can I image the old NT server and load that into a VM without manually re-installing the OS and then the SQL and applications. I am concerned that I wont have the proper install media forget finding decade + old license materials.

From my perspective I am guessing it all comes down to drivers and will NT operate under vmware and would the existing instal be able to make the transition from a one hardware drive set to another. Also heads up

SVM was going along, so we decided to cancel the SVM. Except, it didn't actually stop and performance got worse and worse. Before too long, top was showing load averages of 170 and it was impossible for anyone else to log into the server anymore.

Got on the phone with support, and nothing changed with performance but the SVM task did finally die.  However, there was a rogue copy of our VM sitting out there in a powered off state with a (1) at the end of the name. The tech said it was probably an orphaned copy of our VM that was most likely inconsistent. I figured I'd deal with it later.

Load averages on the guest were still climbing. VMware blamed it on the SAN - which I didn't totally buy. I knew we were oversubscribed, so I started manually moving everything off the host. I finally got down to just my problem VM left on that host, and I crossed my fingers and started a vMotion of it. It almost immediately errored out, with a message that there was already a migration in progress. I went to research the error, and about 5 minutes later I looked back at the vCenter Client, and the original VM was now in a powered off state, and the ""copy"" of the VM (the one with the (1) at the end) was now the one running. And the really scary thing? It was running off of the new SAN volume. The original VMDK on the oversubscribed volume was gone.

We do have a san that can be active/active when mirrored but even if we would have an active/passive san the same principles would apply for the most part.

The two sites would be linked with two or three data connections for both san and network traffic.

Few scenarios

* Hardware or power fails on one site. HA kicks in and boots everything that was running in that site on the site that is still working. All is well.

* All 2-3 links between the sites go down. HA kicks in and we have a split brain situation.

  If we have an active/active san

  If we have an active/passive san then paths from the ESXi serves on one site to the san is lost so HA on the site with the active san would start to boot everything up. When the passive san detects it has lost its connections it should become active and then vSphere detects the SAN is online again and HA would try to boot everything up. Is that the correct understanding?

- removing the nic removes the reference to the DMZ network

- the host configuration tab &gt; networking shows the VM on both the production and DMZ port groups

- I cold migrated a similar server to the 5.1 environment to see if I could duplicate the behavior and I can't.  The similar server only shows a reference to the DMZ network

- migrating to a different host had no effect

- nothing out of the ordinary like RDM's or other odd connections

Hey /r/vmware

I'm working on drawing up a VDI (Horizon View) solution for my organization. One of the sticking points is IOPS (no real surprise here). Determining IOPS for VDI (designing a ramp from 200 to 1200 users over the next 3 years) really is starting to feel like an expensive

Here's a little context:

My original path was to simply upgrade my existing SAN from an HP4500 to the mid-ranged 3PAR 7400 and rely on numerous SAS-drives for IOPS to handle the replica and linked-clones.

However

Now for my questions:

- Anyone using Fusion-IO technology in a production environment? 
- If so
- If I had 4 IO-cards installed in 4 blades could I not use VSA to bundle  each card into a single shared storage volume and then be able to off load my replicas and linked-clones to the VSA-based shared storage?
  - This solves the problem of not being able to take advantage of HA / DRS because the Io-card storage is LOCAL to each blade so I'd lose that resiliency.",self,t5_2qnan,1365733323.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/1c5fin/a_few_questions_planning_out_a_vdi_implementation/

Long story short our UPS in the site that remained up

So

HA did its thing and fired up the VMs on the host in the remaining room but at the point that HA kicked in we had no domain controllers since both were down due to the outage (of course usually I would not run both DCs on the same host but figured sooner that than run production VMs with no UPS cover at all).

This led to lots of fun dependency stuff where all the VMs were restarted by HA but it was pot luck whether the DCs had spun up by the point any given VM came back.

Is there any way with any edition of VMware to put in dependencies?

I know you can assign a HA restart priority to a VM but I'm assuming that simply works off free slots and won't actually delay things if your remaining host(s) can handle the VM load?

We've looked at SANs in the past and my company just doesn't want to shell out the money for one. Whatever. I'm past that. We use Veeam Backup &amp; Replication to replicate critical VMs between hosts, vMotion, Storage vMotion, etc, without the added licensing cost.

Anyway, though: Our blade systems are running the most recent version of ESXi. Our 3 standalone hosts are running 4.1. The reason for this is that they're using Adaptec RAID controllers that aren't supported fully with v5. By this I mean they'll work fine, but I can't manage the RAID controller at all. With ESX 4.1 I've installed the Adaptec management RPM and I can manage them just fine.

Hyper-V supports full management of the RAID controllers on those 3 systems. We own vSphere Essentials currently, we could have live VM migration without any additional hardware purchases.

I guess my question is this: what are the caveats of switching from VMware to Hyper-V? I know we'll need to purchase System Center VMM 2012 SP1 to manage the hosts
Ideally I'd buy a $20k SAN with all the needed redundancy, only because I've dedicated 4+ years of my life to VMware and know it pretty darn well. Its pretty stable and effective. However, I work for accountants, and they fail to understand why the $20k investment in a proper SAN would be best, and I've lost the desire to fight for it.

I've come to this final conclusion for a small form factor home ESXi build. A lot of my OCD has gone into this and I'm having a hard time now pulling the trigger.

Objective...Mirco-ATX board on small form factor case. I've settled on Lian Li PC-V351b (I'd take 355 but don't want to wait for it's release). Next, but it's not a deal breaker. And the rest is simply cost of juggling the combination of working parts for best speed to ram to low temps coordination.

Option 1. As of last Nov 2011, and solid IPMI working. Downside is, it's not the NEW STUFF BABY. It's not Ivy Bridge and not the brand new Z77 chipset. And ram is very expensive. In fact, probably can only afford 16 (4x4) because 4x8gb sticks is very expensive.

Option 2. Since doing this in May 2012, and 3rd generation Ivy Bridge CPUs. Nice. The new ASRock Extreme Micro ATX board support Vt-d. YES. Brand new off the press 3770 Intel i7 support hyper threading and Vt-d with this board. Yes. And, desktop 32 gig is way cheaper compared to option 1. But, no DRAC/IPMI/vKVM at all. Cannot recover remotely from failure. But, not a data center...just my home server so this seems fine.

Option 3. Just saw this and kinda leaning towards this now. The new gamer overclocking Z77 chipset has a new younger brother workstation chipset Q77. And, I can get IPMI functionality to rebuild OS remotely. Yeah! And there is only one ASRock motherboard for Q77 yet for sale on newegg, but no reviews yet. Ok, I'll be the first to buy it I decide. I start to piece it together and then go over to ASRock.com to lookup compatible memory, and not a single 8gb stick is listed. ARGH!!! I figure some 8gb stick will work, but how is one to know.

A coworker and I administer our small/medium sized environment which is approximately 90% virtualized.  We made the switch about four years ago and have benefited greatly.  We are the ""choir"" and don't need to be sold on VMware; we need to know about techniques or emerging virtual technology/practices or how to better leverage our existing equipment.

I have attended local VM user group conferences and found them to be more of sales pitches rather than helpful information.  Having vendors pay to present makes these meet-ups free so I can deal with hearing about how Product X will save my soul.  

I realize VMware partners will be at VMworld and they want to sell us their products but if the presentations/sessions/labs are thinly veiled sales pitches I will be disappointed.  Are there going to be vendor-neutral sessions and labs or is it going to be ""Session X - Presented [VENDOR X]"" where they spend 2 minutes talking about a general problem and the next hour talking about their specific product?

Spending a day at local user group for free is one thing, and pay for the conference it is another matter entirely.

1374611568.0,1iwpnb,Issues with ESXi 5.1 Update 1: Any network created on the host (other than management) will not ping or connect to anything.,Vikko,6,0,23,"I have a set of two identical servers with identical issues.  Servers we had ESXi 4.1 running flawlessly on.  We are preparing for an upgrade and are ""playing"" with 5.1.0a.  Everything goes as expected except when it comes time to adding additional networks.  We usually have 4.  

Management, Clients/Data and something along the lines of 10.10.30.1/24, 10.10.31.1/24, 10.10.32.1/24 and 10.10.33.1/24 respectivly.  

Now the issues is when we try to ping the(non management) xx.1 interfaces

However we find that the routing works fine with other devices.  Just not any interface from the server on the additional networks.  We even installed the Dell version of ESXi 5.1 U1.  No dice.  

We are beginning to feel there is something we are missing that is different in 5.1+ than in 4.1+.  If you guys know of anything that would be great.  Google isn't turning back anything specific to my issues.

**TL;DR: Fresh ESXi 5.1.0 Update 1 Install(including Dell version for powerEdge). Additional networks(management works fine) added to the Host are not responding to network requests.  Switch will ping interface but no routing occurs with server interfaces.  Routing will occur however if new device is introduced to network with same IP.  Servers were taken out of proven and working ""duplicate"" ESXi 4.1 infrastructure.** 

Thanks for reading!

***EDIT: Switch is a physical Cisco C3750G (with ipservices).  It has 5 networked vLans.  Each has their own default Gateway.  One is for remote network(connection between switches).  One for physical machines(w/4 physical ports from server /Etherchanneled ).  One for NetApp FAS(w/4 physical ports into server /Etherchanneled).  One for vMotion (w/2 physical ports from server /Failover) and One for Management (2 physical ports from server /Failover).  All of the listed segments have their own vKernel with the listed above IPs.  Any devices placed on any of the vlans pings any of the others.  The only devices that do not respond to ping are any of the ports with the associated vKernel except for the management.  Placing say a laptop on the vlan with the vMotion network giving it the vMotion vKernel IP will ping.  Unplug it



***EDIT 2:  Also we are able to add datastores/FAS from the 10.10.32.x network.  So there is communication happening there.  Can ping the datastores but not the vKernel***



***EDIT 3: We didn't  get to installing VMs other than vCenter

***EDIT 4: Switch command ""show arp"" lists all of the vKernel IPs.  The switch sees them!***

1371173200.0,1gb5k9,ThinApping RightFax,tuvok302,6,2,9,"So

In the base image we've baked the print drivers for it, the package looks like it's almost going to work: When you print to the RightFax printer, the fax menu pops up and lets you enter in your information, however when I hit next it fails to actually send the fax to the rightfax server.   The fax menu closes (Like it does on a working install), sends some packets to the server and then nothing.  It doesn't even log an entry on the server. 

I managed to get it to work for a short while the other day by registering a DLL (RFaxUI.dll) which I had copied to the same folder as the exe that app was looking for

Before anyone asks, it won't let me run any monitoring software like procmon to monitor what it's touching on the OS to help troubleshoot and figure out what it can't do in the thinapp.  I've tested the package on a Windows XP laptop I had, that I'd installed RightFax on so the printers had been created and it seemed to work just fine, so I'm thinking it's something to do with Win7 and RF.  

So

I'm about ready to give up and tell the business it's not possible

VMkernel Port ""Management Network"" is connected to vSwitch0

VMkernel Port ""vMotion"" is connected to vSwitch0

They are connected to HP ProCurve 2510-48G switches.

A few days ago I got an error

&gt; The vMotion failed because the destination host did not receive data from the source host on the vMotion network. Please check your vMotion network settings and physical network configuration and ensure they are correct.

I entered the host into Maintenance Mode to migrate off the VMs, vmnic4 still said disconnected.

Didn't do anything more about it until today when I was planning on digging more into it. However today vmnic4 says Connected and all good.

Any suggestions on what might cause the sudden ""Disconnect"" and sudden ""Connect"" again? Apprently nothing has changed. No reboots of switches or anything.

Could there be some ""temporarily disabled"" feature on the ProCurve switch for that port/mac-address or something? Didn't notice anything when I ran ""sh run"" a few days ago.

**TL;DR;** vmnic4 disconnected a few days ago

**Edit**: spesified that I checked the *physical* switch

**Edit2**: after reboot, I have changed the cables just to rule it out. Have been running flawless for now, however it ran flawless before the issue occurred too. *Thanks for all your input!* :-) I'll be back if it acts up again!

Should I configure the Datastore in which my .vmx and .vmdk files are housed on as iSCSI (maximum 16 TB) or NFS?  I'm worried about the space constraints of iSCSI.  My architecture will consist of approximately 10-15 servers and 20 virtual workstations.  I suppose I could create multiple iSCSI targets

I also assume iSCSI is the correct answer in this case due to it being a better solution than NFS for a VM Datastore (right?)

I know my way around both and would be considered well up on both as I've built a cluster

If I create a deployment of VMs within vCloud any vDS will have the name and a UUID in brackets as expected.

The issue I'm having is when I attach a VM from within vCenter to the vDS that was previously created from within vCloud Director. Packets are dropped completely from a VM inside a vApp to a VM connected in via vCenter.

The only fix is to import the VM into the same vApp or indeed the same organisation (I've not tried others) and connectivity works.

What makes me think this is an odd issue is that the method of attaching an existing VM to a vDS created in vCloud for temp use worked in the past

Network is not a vApp network and was created independently outside of any vApps.

Has anyone come across this before?

We're looking for a SAN, but that is mostly because our SQL server is poorly configured (everything is cashed in memory, ugh).

We were told to look at a handful of models:

* Dell EqualLogic PS4000X:

This one is ok, expandability means dropping another $36k on a second one and setting up a storage grid (bleh).

* EMC VNX(e) 3100/3300/5300:

This one is nicer, head unit + disk arrays), it's expandability is ""put as many or as few drives in the enclosures as you want, keep adding disks to pools"", you could practically let it slip that it runs Solaris and ZFS and I'd believe you with how much the behavior is similar. We were told to go with a 5300 for the additional scalability (EMC changed their mind over a 3300 after seeing my layout diagrams), it's only $2k more than they quoted a 3300 for us....

Alas EMC nickels and dimes us to death for software

* Dell EqualLogic 6100 series:

I was told to look at this due to the huge growing pains of the PS4000X



We have a few major projects in the works, 10K SAS for Exchange, 7.2K NL-SAS for OS/ISO/DEV/TEST/Etc.), which you can't do with  any Dells...


I was also told today to look at StorTrends

---

I'm continuously getting conflicting stories from sales (don't we always?), but I couldn't see how that is a large enough amount to go with NFS over iSCSI for replication).

I'm told I can't mix and match disks in EMC

I'm told that _no one_ in their right mind does NFS mounts in production (although I'm a proponent of iSCSI

I was also told the disk enclosure model was ""the old way"" and for some vague reason worse than EqualLogic's grid setup....

Also - some tell me I have to buy 5.0, and we don't want to drop our entire production network on a newly released product.

---

Finally, but I'd like to get rid of that and do a VPN tunnel over our WAN (save us some money, the point-to-point is never really used for low-latency stuff anyway). I'm assuming either way we may look into Veeam's SmartCDP because it seems the easiest and we can implement it on any SAN technology.

Working with Rachel from VMWare support we figured out the following...
    
    
This issue occurred because two situations existed:  
1. the value of LVM/EnableResignature was set to 1 on all hosts  
2. LUN 25 was seen with different LUN IDs on the ESX hosts in the cluster.
    
    
To resolve this issue
        esxcfg-advcfg -s 0 /LVM/EnableResignature
    
    
We also corrected the presentation of LUN 25 by removing the LUN from presentation to the hosts
    
    
The situation we encountered is described in the following Knowledge Base article:

I've been researching the move heavily as it's largely my project.  One thing I haven't found much discussion on is the topic of splitting or merging the vCenter application server and DB server.  Pretty much everything I've found says

- 5 hosts

- ~250 VM's including ~70 servers

- Future view expansion is likely

- Enterprise+ licensing for all hosts

- Guest OS licensing as well as SQL licensing is covered under our EA

- Guest OS will be Win2k8R2 w/MSSQL 2008R2

- All hosts and VM's in one physical site

- iSCSI storage to 4 Equallogic arrays

- We will be doing a fresh install of vCenter and moving our VM's to that via cold migration because we just bought new hosts.  

- The SSO

- We will not be upgrading any hosts

- vCenter and DB server (if separate) will be VM's

- There is no resource contention in our current environment and will not be in our new environment either.

Let me know if I'm missing any pertinent data.  We're a small enough environment that we could probably do just fine w/a combined install.  That's how we have it now in 4.1.

1364010141.0,1aub4x,"ESXi 5 - Using iSCSI with 2 NICs, only seeing traffic over one, is this normal?",Astat1ne,5,14

I have a lab environment configured with the following details:

1. An ESXi 5.0 host with 3 NICs - one NIC is assigned to management and other duties.  Two are assigned for iSCSI traffic on a different subnet to the management subnet.  All NICs are supported Intel models.
2. A Windows Storage Server box also with 3 NICs - one NIC is management and general traffic
3. The switch being used is a Netgear GS716T.  The only deviation from normal network configuration I've made is to enable Jumbo Frame support on the iSCSI ports on the switch (as well as on both hosts).
4. I've configured the iSCSI details on the ESXi host as per the vmware documentation.

The issue I'm seeing is I can only see traffic flowing from one of the ESXi host's iSCSI IPs (when viewed via Resource Manager on the Windows Storage Server system).  In performance testing

Is this normal behaviour or have I missed something in my configuration?  Thanks.

I have an IBM x3500 M3 server with a ServeRAID M5015 raid controller card (which I believe is a re-branded LSI MegaRAID 9260-8i RAID card). The server is currently running VMWare ESXi 5.0 Update 2 and attached to it we currently have 2 arrays attached to it: 

- 2x1TB in a RAID 1
- 5x900GB drives in a RAID5 which acts as VM data storage

What we are essentially trying to do is expand our RAID5 array to include more drives. I looked through the WebBIOS for options to expand the array (IE expand it by adding drives) and I wasn't able to find any options for doing so. I spoke with someone at IBM regarding this issue and they advised me to install the MegaRAID Storage Manager and attempt to add additional drive space through that tool. 

Unfortunately they did not provide adequate instructions to set this tool up. After some google searching I came across several instructions which detail how to get this working.  I've installed the LSI ESXi module on the server as well as the MSM software on my client machine as described here. When I scan for hosts I can see my ESXi host but the IP shows up as 0.0.0.0. Additionally when I try to log in I get an error message which says ""Unable to connect to CIMOM server"". 

Ideally we would like to add all five of our new 900GB drives to this new array at the same time. I understand that this process can take several days so if possible I'd like to expand the array while the server is running in order to avoid downtime. I know that you can do this with software RAID and I've been lead to believe that with the MSM tool and hardware RAID you can do this as well. It seems it's just a matter of getting MSM to connect with my RAID card at this point.

We have a physical box like this that we were using so I decided to do a P2V conversion on it using VMWare's converter.  It worked and I was able to console into it with no issues.  At this time explorer.exe was loading.  

I decided to install VMware tools on it.  Now when the machine reboots it shows the normal startup screens

When I ctrl+alt+end (rdp) I get the task manager.  When I try to manually start up explorer.exe it doesn’t work.  However
I’ve tried uninstalling vmtools using the command line and that was successful.  The problem remains though.  I’ve tried giving the machine more video memory because it was complaining about not being able to work in a certain resolution but even with that error gone I’m still having this issue.

Any advice?  Google hasn’t been very helpful.  Has anyone run into this before?  Thank you in advance.

I am in the process of upgrading an ESX 3.5 Farm to ESXi 4.1 and I wanted to share with you a major hurdle that I just ran in to.

I started with this company 3 weeks ago, oh well :)

The Test/Dev upgrade went fine, ESX3&amp;4 are, ESX 5&amp;6 are - I'm sure it made sense at the time =/

Anyway I start with ESX1 and everything is going pretty well when I notice in our alerts mailbox a message from the NetApp: FCP Partner Path Misconfigured - Host I/O access through a non-primary and non-optimal path was detected.

I am/was a pretty big FC newb so I called NetApp and they said ""Ya you don't want that to happen

Fast forward a few days, vmotion isn't worry for the VM in question and I can't shut it down either. Had to connect to the host and shut it off from there. Wrote it off as a one-off, cross my fingers and started looking at a few other issues. Later that evening the same thing happens, I was able to react faster, do some vmotions and things settled down once the busy VM quieted down. At this point I know it is something with my upgraded Hosts and take the weekend to think it over.

I come in Monday morning and decide to focus on this issue but before I can get settled the same server (team foundation) goes tits up. I freak out a little as at this point I am starting my 4th week :) So I call vMware and they take a look. Tech support guy was pretty awesome, take a look at that"". But while he is looking around I notice all IO traffic is going on HBA3 and I remember the NetApp alert I got.

Over half the datastores on ESX1 and ESX2 were using secondary paths. Sure enough all of the affected VMs were in datastores connected via secondary paths! Curse you FC!

So tonight I am going to fix those up

Hopefully this is useful to someone planning to do an upgrade. Looks like the issue is because multi-path load balancing is not available in 3.5

1. I have the Cold Clone v 4.1. Does this work with ESXi 4.1 or only 4.0?
2. These are single DC networks. Are problems less likely with only one domain controller since it isn't syncing with anything else?
3. Assuming a successful cold clone


A bit of extra information: Building up a fresh DC and demoting the physical DC isn't really an option since they are most likely running Exchange (and that isn't supported).

Ideally I'd like to just keep the existing 2003 DCs and then build up new 2008 DCs on the ESXi host box. Doing that simultaneously isn't going to happen right now either. So

Unfortunately

So we ended up with our SQL Server 2008 machine with about 300gb worth of space used on the SAN with Snapshots. Which filled the SAN. And stopped the SQL server.

Whoops.

Anyway, but I needed to remove those snapshots.  I tried it this morning, and it ran happily for about 1/2 an hour, and BLAM, disk full again.  F7U12 indeed.

I freed up some more space

I guess it all comes down to what is the main difference between consumed host memory usage, guest active, and guest shared memories.

Please forgive me but I've read the articles on the VMKB that somewhat explain this but I just can't seem to grasp the concept.
