Why? There are several reasons. One is that submitters with a cause tend to be overzealous with their submitting habits. The flood of Kony submissions is a perfect example. If they had been allowed to stand, and it's often difficult to tell what points in an advocacy post are grounded in fact, and which are driven more by enthusiasm for a cause.

Advocacy posts also tend to climb to the top of the queue rather quickly, despite concerns voiced in the comments about where the donations solicited by the video were being directed. Such popularity is understandable: we all want to get behind a good cause. But while the generosity that redditors often display when it comes to charity can be inspiring, it also makes Reddit attractive to scam artists. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that the Invisible Children group is a scam. My point is simply that allowing advocacy posts free reign on worldevents sends a message that it's okay to solicit money, and it shouldn't be the moderators' job to go through and vet every group that does so under the pretense of addressing international problems.

So... given that allowing advocacy posts would ultimately result in a front page given over to high scoring posts soliciting money and/or rallying support for causes that aren't always trustworthy -- to the exclusion of the sort of analysis and in-depth reportage that likely brought you here in the first place -- what can be done about it?

We, sign a petition, or spread the word about a particular cause, consider it an advocacy post. Resist the urge to vote it up. Let us know so we can remove it from the queue. I've updated the rules and guidelines in the sidebar to make that particular rule more clear and prominent.

**For example**

Here's the thing about comments like this: they turn everything back to the same issue

Yes, all over Reddit -- ubiquitous, really. There are other stories, related stories, that are also worth exploring. So when they crop up, why don't we talk about those?

A more subtle but less related phenomenon: Someone posts about a news story.  Someone else comments about why people don't pay attention to it.

**For example**

Okay, or the rest of Reddit, or the rest of the world for that matter, has its attention pointed elsewhere.

But it's more than just a matter of pointing out the obvious.  Comments like that reiterate the message that no one cares.  If that ends up being the first or only comment in a thread

Yes, then it's redundant, and we can do without it.  I don't think it has to be a clone of those other subreddits, and that's why I still have faith in subreddits like this and the capacity of the Reddit community to foster them.

Originally, I see comments like that in nearly every submission made to /r/worldevents, and it's not a single person posting them.  And I worry that it's contributing to the relative rarity of discussion around here.

**So I'm only asking two things:**

1. Try to avoid posting comments that are likely to discourage discussion; and

2. If you feel the urge to make a comment like that

I've just banned user [Mattanderson](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mattanderson). A quick look at his profile will help explain why. Every link he submitted to /r/worldevents until today -- and indeed

Last week I PM'd Matt to let him know how it looked from my end. I tried to be respectful and let Matt know that he could absolve himself of suspicion by simply posting links to other domains from time to time. We all have our favorite sources

Matt's response was to treat my message as an attack on his political stance. Even after repeated assurance that even links to other socialist-themed websites would suffice

Today, you'll see listed as their website, you guessed it:

&gt; Website: http://www.wsws.org

Given the resistance he put up in a private conversation

For the record, or at any other socialist-themed website, are free to submit links to that material here. Mattanderson was banned not because of his political disposition, but because his involvement with /r/worldevents (and with reddit in general) is indistinguishable from spamming.

To give you a sense of the tenor with which I tried to approach the matter

&gt; **Just a head's up...**   
&gt;A number of the links you've submitted to /r/worldevents have been reported to the moderators. So far, and more intent on promoting wsws.org. The fact that your only contribution to discussion has been a defense of WSWS as a source seems to add credence to that view. In my capacity as moderator, I try to stay neutral with regards to the perspective of articles submitted to the reddit, but if you continue to post nothing but WSWS articles, and comment only in defense of those articles, I'll be inclined to treat you as a spammer in the future, and moderate accordingly.

&gt; That isn't to say that I want you to leave /r/worldevents

&gt; Cheers.

Why?
---

worldevents [started out](http://redd.it/b41r6) as a reddit dedicated to facilitating in-depth submissions and discussion. Realistically

Lately

That leaves us with two options: 1) let worldevents gradually morph into a worldnews clone

The plan so far
---

These are the rules that Don_Quijoder and I have been discussing behind the scenes. The precise wording is subject to change.

&gt; 1. The focal point of any submission should be either analysis of a current event

&gt; 2. Questions submitted to the new queue must be submitted as text.posts

&gt; 3. Submissions will be removed by the moderators if the title features descriptive terms

&gt; 4. Photos and collections of photos are not allowed

I want to point out that I regard that first rule as potentially dangerous. It make the mods' discretion the primary standard for determining whether or not a post is appropriate, worth discussing. But it's also important that we have a rule that covers the ground that rule covers, so something like it *will* be put in place. If anyone has suggestions for a less subjective rule, we'd love to discuss it.

Rule #3 is adapted from a rule set I helped concoct for /r/RepublicOfPolitics. The purpose is to exclude sensationalistic and misleading headlines. The easiest way to make sure that you don't run afoul of this rule is to simply cut &amp; paste some part of the article text and make that the title of your submission.
