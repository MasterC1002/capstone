The NC GOP has taken every opportunity to introduce bills this session that are about as right-wing as you can get. They have introduced several bills that made national headlines, to [reduce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/H451) the [voting](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S428) [rights](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S666) [of](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S721) [our](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S668) [citizens](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S667), and to [impose a 2-year waiting period for divorce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S518). They have [arrested peaceful protesters protesting these exact issues](http://www.wral.com/49-arrested-at-moral-monday-protest-at-state-legislature-/12441971). 

This will not do. We need to do something about this. Whether you are republican, something needs to change. 


So

**Run for office. Run as a democrat. Run as a republican. Just run.**


As of 5-13-13,432,830 registered voters in North Carolina. Breakdown is as follows: 2,764,896 Democrats, 1,982, 20,494 Unaffiliated. Only taking into account the two major parties

**People didn’t vote.**

* Not in the numbers they should. 
Of the 7.5 million people old enough to vote, with only 2.7 Million voting. --[Numbers come from NC BoE](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?ID=70)--

**People didn’t run.**




* There were at least [24 seats in the state house](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012). (It is entirely possible that I missed a few)

**Senate seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 6 	– (Jones

District 10    – (Duplin

District 29 	– (Moore

District 33 	– (Davidson

District 34 	– (Davie

District 35 	– (Union) – Tommy Tucker (R)

District 36 	– (Cabarrus

District 41 	– (Mecklenburg) – Jeff Tarte (R)

District 43 	– (Gaston) – Kathy Harrington (R)

District 48 	– (Henderson) – Tom Apodaca (R)

**House seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 111	 – (Cleveland) - Tim Moore (R) 

District 117	 – (Henderson) - Chuck McGrady (R) 

District 120	 – (Cherokee, Macon) - Roger West (R)	

There are 50 state senate seats and 120 state representative seats available. Yes, you are not guaranteed a win, but **you can be part of a show of force.** Let the NCGA know that we, the people of North Carolina will not stand for this.

You don't have to run for the General Assembly, or County Commissioner. As long as you run. [Filing for municipal elections begins July 5th, and ends July 19th](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?id=61&amp;s=4)

**People aren’t involved enough.**

* I recently went to the Democratic Party Convention for my county. There were, I do live in a county that leans Republican, but that seems like little excuse for only 15 people. 

We need more people to get involved. Find a chapter of [Young Democrats](http://www.ydnc.org/) or [Young Republicans](http://www.ncfypr.com/associations.shtml) (If you are under 35 or 40, and ask them what you can do. Let them know that you plan on running.

-------

We have an opportunity coming up. We have a chance to tell the right-wing crazies that their legislation is not welcome here. We need to get them out of office. We need to get involved now. A good

2014 is right around the corner.

[Here are two charts-- the left-hand graph shows 2009's pay scale, we're the only state in the union to offer no raises in that time frame). Also realize that all salaries have been frozen for six years. Meaning that if you were a new teacher six years ago, you'll still be paid starting salary for your 7th year of teaching. [As a result, average teacher salaries have fallen more in NC than in any other state.](http://i.imgur.com/2OfX5BD.jpg)

His complaint was made after reading a blog post on tumblr (http://therant905.tumblr.com/post/47047197931/good-job-mike-not-really).  Stone then found out that the men responsible for such a tame blog had a weekly radio show on WDCC a college station at Central Carolina Community College and called the governing body of the school to demand a suspension.

In an idiotic move the school agreed and suspended the show.

So far Stone hasn't responded to any of this and we are only left with the fact that a politician threw the first amendment out the window because he got his feelings hurt.

Message:

&gt;Senator
As one of your constituents I am writing you this in regards to the upcoming vote on CISPA. I was sorely disappointed to see that Rep. McIntyre voted yes for this bill. I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse.
I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving into the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this.
I voted for you last election but if you support this bill I can assure you that you will not have my vote nor that of many of my friends at The University of North Carolina.
Your younger generation of tar heels does not agree with these draconian laws as we understand CISPA.
Again
I look forward to hearing back from you.

Dear Friend

Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns regarding the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011

On May 12, or an intellectual property rights owner who has been harmed by an Internet site dedicated to infringing activities (ISDIA), also known as a rogue website, to take action against that site.  A site would be designated as an ISDIA if their sole purpose is to facilitate copyright infringement, or promote or sale of counterfeited American works.

A recent study suggests that copyright piracy alone costs the American economy as much as $58 billion a year and countless jobs.  I strongly support the goal of reducing the theft of intellectual property that is so important to North Carolina's economy

As with all proposed legislation, after all, on the need to combat the theft of American intellectual property, should work together to address those concerns.  As you may know, the Senate is scheduled to begin consideration of this legislation later this month, and I intend to approach the debate and amendment process with an open mind. Through a full and robust debate, I believe we can improve the legislation

Again

Sincerely

Signature

Kay R. Hagan

I've seen lots of negativity and petty name calling coming from both sides of the political spectrum over truly mundane things here, and everything in between. It isn't productive, it isn't good for the community and, above all else, it's not what North Carolina stands for. This is a state of growth, progress, common sense

Most importantly, politics in NC is starting to look like a topic where people call each other names and throw reason out the door. Disagree with someone? ""You don't deserve my respect. FUCK. YOU."" Dare to voice a differing (and usually conservative) opinion? See you after 30+ downvotes. Who wants to learn more about a process, and in turn become more educated and perhaps join your side of the argument, when the people currently involved can't treat each other better than two chimps fighting over table scraps?

I'd like to see us welcome intelligent discourse, but if we both address each other reasonably we can learn something new. Reddit is not serious business, but it can be an opportunity to learn a new thing or two about someone different than you. We should be seizing that opportunity in this subreddit, and I hope our regulars will take it to heart and make people feel more welcome.

 Jesus was actually very clear on the subject of politics - not in that he was on the ""right"" or the ""left""

 The most profound example of this is a story we all know well. In Jesus's time, arrest and even put to death the followers of Christ. Literally, as a Roman citizen your tax dollars went to killing Christians. The pharisees knew this so they asked Jesus should we pay our taxes. Jesus dismissed them saying ""render unto Ceaser what is Caesers"". 

 Why would Jesus tell his followers to pay taxes to a government that kills them

 Because it doesn't matter. If you stop a gay couple from getting married because you passed a law, only her actions. 

 If politics mattered, and you dont do that with legislation or referenda.

Saw all 3 again this evening!
I tried to get a photo/video and could see nothing on the video but I got a little spec in a picture so I'll upload it.

I paid particular attention to detail this time so I can describe it more accurately:

A perpetual light blue light on the underbelly
3 lights in a triangle formation around the blue light:
The ""top of the triangle"" light was blinking only white and the timing was different from the ""bottom"" two lights that blinked in synch and alternated between red and white.

That's all I got.


EDIT: 
I e-mailed the ACLU in Raleigh... So i'll post any feedback they provide.
Also it's 9:43 so I'm setting up shop on the porch... I'll try to get a photo if I see anything.
Thanks for all the feedback so far.  Here's a few interesting links I came across the past day:

Anyone else seen these bad boys flying around at night (or day)?

I've seen them between 10-11PM on both occasions

Both times I witnessed these, seemed like they were being driven by drunk drivers around in wide circles/making jagged u-turns.  I always noticed at least 4 lights (one being in the center of the body on the belly.)  First time, I heard what sounded like a faint lawn mower, tonight I heard nothing but VERY light wind (whooshing) sounds.

This comment on the 'article' is what got me:

""UAV's are unmistakable. You will know when you see one because of the irregular light pattern. Also, you would most definitely hear noise as you normally do when planes fly that low. These are inaudible unless they are landing most likely. You will also catch 3-4 in the sky at the same time if you have a good view of the night sky. When you see these 3 or 4 come together and ""huddle"", then you will know FOR SURE you are not seeing airplanes. At least I for one have never seen any airplanes come that close to one another on purpose.""

I was at the Dixie Classic at the time the incident occurred. Without getting into the news reports

I was standing in line with hundreds of other people outside the Jim Graham building. I could not see inside the building

A siren went off, one large fire marshal's vehicle which I believe was medical in nature, and one regular ""police car."" No other law enforcement or medical vehicles of any kind ever appeared.

Several minutes later, ""It's over. Somebody got shot. The show is canceled."" This person then indicated that he was recounting what officials inside had said to him --- he did not witness the shot.

I chose to remain in line along with about fifty other people, and there was a ricochet, which caught another man.

After a few minutes, and everything I saw supported the claim that he was indeed shot through the hand.

I advanced to the entrance of the Jim Graham building and looked inside. I did not see any other injured people, but I saw no medical professionals, and no other injured people exited the building.

When I got home after the event

It was not until multiple hours later that the news stories were updated. Now they all say that three individuals were shot: Two men, _not_ a law enforcement officer, discharged the gun, and that he was attempting to unzip the gun's carrying case when it went off. Lastly, they say the woman was shot in the torso and (from what I can gather) wounded quite substantially.

I have the deepest respect and concern for the severity of this situation, if indeed three people were shot. I cannot understand how in all the time I was near the entrance talking to people going in and out of the building, all of them consistently reported that two men had been shot, if indeed a woman was shot in the torso. Furthermore, I am confused by the ""oddly specific"" nature of the initial reports that turned out to be false.

•	Requiring Voter ID – 319, and Hispanics are more likely to lack acceptable ID and are also more likely to vote for the Democrat.
•	Restrictions on Early Voting – 56% of NC voted early in 2012 and the majority of those voters were Democrats.  Obama led by 200
•	Elimination of Same-Day Registration – Used by 96
•	Elimination of Straight-Party Voting - In 2012
•	Ending Pre-Registration – NC high schools proactively helped students pre-register to vote which greatly encourages young people to vote.  Democrats won the youth vote with 67%.

I understand that this place has a heavy liberal bias, just go look through some of the biggest posts of the last year or so -- yes there are buried posts but not a lot of high quality buried posts.

I know it can be hard on the people with opinions that are less popular on reddit.  But this is where you have to step it up and really make compelling arguments supporting what you believe.  I see it all the time where rediquette wins out.  You just have to put some effort into your argument

I have no doubt that this poll will come out with at least some form of political discussion allowed.  It's the responsible thing to do, check the quality of your posts and not your political view.  

Lastly, but it **cannot** exist simply to replace politics discussion in this subreddit.  /r/NorthCarolina will always have more traffic.

1349997186.0,11c440,Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America is headed to N.C.!  Want to be our next breakfast?,BreakfastWStrangers,20,1,8,"Greetings NC Redditors

My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'. We're currently in WV for the next few days and will next head into NC for what is likely a 10 day stretch. 

* [Breakfast with Strangers site](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Our goal is to make stops in Asheville, Greenville, and a little stop here and there (dates soon). If interested please email us at: breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'North Carolina' in the subject line. Some voices we'd love to hear from: academic, mail carrier, and a stay at home mom but we're open to all. :)

**More details about our project**

On July 18, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

It was never about homosexuals, or values. For them, the politicians posing as preachers, historians, and free-thinkers, it's much larger. Their goal is to religify any secular issue they can, create an army or god-fearing pawns to vote them into power

Bringing the secular sphere of politics to a religious realm is disastrous. It turns reasonable, we had no chance.

So brace yourself for the cousin-kissin' bass-ackwards hick jokes that will surely come. Be aware that these jokes and insults are only capable of putting the religious right on defense-bolstering their ill founded faithlogic--and of ramming the feed-stick of defeat down the throats of those who tried to fight this amendment. Don't hide your head in the sand

Dan has a blood disease that has evaded diagnosis. The cause is unknown, until his insurance reached the maximum allowable benefit. I don't know the exact details, but I do know there is a 60 day period where he can not afford treatment, and is not covered by any insurance. So, he is not able to get treatment.
I saw him last week
What I am asking is a few things: 1. If you live in the Charlotte NC area, and having his business do a bit better would probably help take a load off. They also are a lot cheaper than the dealerships (at least for Mercedes), and do as good or better quality work. 2. If you are able and feel so inclined, find the business address on the website and send him a check so that he can get some medical treatment. 3. If you feel so inclined, write a letter to your congressman telling them about this man, who has worked all his life, owns his own business, and endangering his life.

As a NC educator with nearly 20 years experience, understand how government officials can not support the advanced education achievements of its teachers. Everyday, teachers across NC talk with their students about the importance of a good education and they do this while elected officials say just the opposite.


The budget proposal only emphasizes the steady devaluation of what should be among the most respected professions. Who goes to school? Everyone...the cashier at Food Lion, the plumber who fixes your toilet. With the exception of a small percentage, we all start our education in the public schools.


In this budget,184.5 teachers, 3,850 teacher assistants, and 272 Support Personnel (guidance counselors, psychologist, etc.). It also includes the further reduction of textbook funding by $77 million, the discontinuation of teacher tenure and the elimination of the Teaching Fellows program while allotting $50 million for school vouchers. This clearly indicates that those currently in elected positions have no idea what our teachers do each day in the public schools. Who will want to teach in NC? In six short years


The children show up every August and their parents expect a highly qualified, but parents demand a book and blame administrators and teachers when there aren't enough books and supplies for every student. How about online textbooks? Do you really think every classroom is equipped with technology that includes laptops, iPads and computers and the infrastructure to support that technology? Free public education? Not exactly. NC's teachers are paying for the education of the state's children with their own money as they buy basic classroom supplies. I sincerely hope you will see the folly in this budget and the far reaching damage it will do to North Carolina's public schools.",,False,,t5_2qhmx,,http://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1j442a/with_the_exception_of_a_small_percentage_we_all/

I'm looking to spend a few nights of the first week of September (during the week after labor day) on a solo camping/fishing trip for some much-needed ""me"" time.  

Want to do the South Core banks because it seems to be the most primitive area of the OBX.  I've done extensive fishing in the areas between Avon-Hatteras and Ocracoke

I've got a pretty good ""to do"" list prepared (been about 8 years since I've been camping so I'm prepping in advance)

* From a camping standpoint...are the beaches as wide there as they are throughout most of the OBX?  Mainly...will there be enough room to park the truck and camp without worrying about a high tide washing everything away?
* Is there a place on the island where I can buy ice?  This really seems like my biggest issue from a list-making standpoint
* The ferry from Davis appears to be the best way to get there from Raleigh.  Are there any other vehicle ferries that may be a bit closer/easier?
* Can you purchase fishing licenses at ferry offices?
* What can I expect from a crowd standpoint...I'm sure if I stay over a weekend there will be a lot of fishermen there
* I generally use shrimp/mullet on the OBX

I'm planning on getting there on a Tuesday and staying as long as the fishing is good.  If the fishing sucks

I moved to NC a few years back.  My TX issued drivers license didn't expire until 2012 so I didn't transfer it to NC right away.

I went in to the DMV this past Feb to go ahead and get a NC Lic before my TX lic was expired more than 1 year (one of the items listed on the NC DMV website that can be used is an out of state lic that is not more than 1 year expired).

I went through all the steps, however, right at the end, the person helping me told me I was on a Do Not Renew list and that TX had put a hold on me.

After some research

When I spoke to the court clerk in TX, then appear in court in TX... OR pay the $1,200 fine.

Now, she took different forms of ID to the DMV and didn't present her TX lic at all.

I really don't want to go through the hassle of dealing with the TX ticket especially as it will fall-off next year.
