I do not feel happy... I have almost never been happy or content with my life. It has always been a let down. I have always been a let down. It hurts to live another day. I hate doing anything. I want to disconnect from feelings. I don't want to take any medication

I have felt this way for a year now. I constantly think about my death.  
I will respond to everyone reply as quickly as possible. Hopefully a golden answer will arise and I won't end up dead in the next few years.

Also

Sob story: For those that pmed about it

I hope someone reads this. I am lonely. I feel broken inside. I cannot express myself by any physical action. I hope I can convey my feelings to someone out there. I go day through day doing the same thing over and over again. During my days I small talk with others, or any other means of communicating anyone. I feel excommunicated from society. I could come here and post anonymously, as a no one. I just feel so lonely and insignificant. I have no one to share my life with and it's passing before my eyes. I'm not achieving anything. I'm just another person in this world.

It seems like every time I return home from work, I become annoyed at human problems that could be considered minute to others. To surmise my hardships, I would sum it up with me losing control of my own mind. Not being able to trust what my own judgment… I am not going to try and make major psychological evaluations on where my life went wrong.  I developed this bleak personality with a pessimistic spectrum to what reality is. I am now 18 and I have social anxiety issues, self-confidence issues, and am obviously shy. I have spent about a year of my life focusing on an ideal notion that I don’t even know to be true anymore. I have deceived myself to the point where I cannot make a logical rational thought concerning this matter. When I started my job, I began noticing that a girl was looking at me. Or at least I thought she was. This resulted into me taking an interest in her. The interest grew deeper over the months. I began staring at her a lot. I believe that she would look at me too. There’d be a lot of awkward glances and uncomfortable situations between us. I thought that she was just shy and really liked me. I became obsessed in my head about the idea of her. I didn’t even know a thing about her, but I became obsessed in my own thoughts. These hints or what I perceived as hints to her liking me continued on for about a year. I’m not going to explain more about what led me to believe that she liked me. There would be more than just the occasional locking stare. I am not going to try and convince anyone and mostly because I feel insane. Ultimately, it could be completely one way or the other. I believe that because I cannot clearly assess the situation means that I am somewhat insane. I must be incredibly stupid to not be able to evaluate the situation. I want to avoid being an absolute fool and mislead myself
This whole problem that I face every day is just the start of the long list of problems that I do have. One of my other major problems is the lack of socializing with other people. I’d explain more thoroughly about what troubles me,False,,t5_2qowo,1360607296.0,,,t3_17zhtm

But please read this bit.


I am constantly chasing down people who think they are ""borderline J/P"" or something like that


**This is the key point I want to establish.**  Myers-Briggs is *based on Carl Jung's cognitive functions model*.  They took his work

Why did they turn Carl Jung's cognitive model in to a horoscope?  Well

Yet



* *Carl Jung's Cognitive Model*

MBTI is actually useful *because* it is a shortcut for Jung's model.  If you treat it that way, defining I/E as introvert/extrovert and J/P as judging/perceiving), or at least treat them as suggestions/observations.

INTJ is just an acronym to shorten the function stack of Ni-Te-Fi-Se.  INFJ is a shortcut for Ni-Fe-Ti-Se.  Myers and Briggs chose to redefine the acronym to have a different meaning because they were testing for stereotypes by each letter and scoring according to that.  But tests are inaccurate.  **There is not a scale**.  **You are either INTJ or INFJ**

See, and you can thus use a test to ask people if they dislike crowds and make an educated guess that they are an INTJ, but this is not actually a definitive feature of an INTJ.

Similarly


**Ok

Carl Jung viewed everyone has having four functions for processing information.

**Intuition** and **Sensing** as Perceiving functions for taking in data.

**Thinking** and **Feeling** for decision-making and judgements. (Judging functions)

He said that everyone used all four

For example

You use **Intuition** either introvertedly (long term processing in your head) or extrovertedly (to judge your immediate environment). 

Extroverted Intuition users are seeing subtle connections in the things they observe

[Introverted Intuition compared to Extroverted Intuition](http://personalityjunkie.com/10/extraverted-intuition-ne-vs-introverted-intuition-ni/)

Same deal goes for all of these. **Sensing** is concrete intake of information

**Thinking** is objective thought process. **Feeling** is valuation

Same deal goes for all of them. Introverted sensors base their mental picture heavily on their past and experience and a black/white knowledge of right/wrong or facts. Extrovert sensors take in their environment very factually

Introvert thinkers look IN to a concept, as a simplified rule.

Extrovert feelers apply valuation externally

So

Later on, with the two judging functions in the middle). And your top two are always opposite attitudes. This works out to about sixteen different possible patterns assuming these rules are ubiquitous.

A number of psychologists and students of Jung's work noticed these patterns. Myers and Briggs developed an acronym to shorthand it. The middle two letters indicate your top two functions. The last letter (J or P) indicates if the Judging or Perceiving function is extroverted

So for example, thus, Fi third, Se fourth (and weakest process).

Myers and Briggs went on to take this acronym
They redefined all of the functions this way, which is a massive simplification of it.

Then they developed a test to test for each of the stereotypes of the letters.

Basically, but it's very unreliable. It's possible to be very extroverted in behavior or value (wanting interaction, to be social) and still be an INTJ (Ni dominant, Se inferior, probably overwhelmed by a lot of interaction but still wanting to be social anyway).

So while the test is accurate more times than not

&gt; ""ENFPs are warm

Tons of people can relate to this!

&gt;They value intelligence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which they continuously strive to fulfill.

Tons of people relate to this too! ISTJs

The vague

If you switch back to the Jungian model


* *On introversion and extroversion.*

""I""'s have a dominant introverted function (Ni, Fi).  ""E""'s have a dominant extroverted function.  *This is all*.  It's very possible to be introverted and love people and be very social.  It's simply that dominant introverted functions tend to find too much input overwhelming, while dominant extroverted functions tend to thrive on more data (Se absorb anything they can, Ne scans constantly for connections, Te tries to control everything, Fe is connecting with people).

But all of us ""introverts"" have a secondary function that is extroverted.  We can develop this and use this socially.  This is all based on the individual.  So if you are INTJ and social and don't really relate to how everyone on this board seems to hate being around people?  It's not just you.  I'm a very social INTJ, loud clubs, because I find all the loud noise very input-overwhelming.


* *The test scores are meaningless.*

Remember, J = Judger, P = Perceiver) so they could test for stereotypes.  J's are people with an extroverted judging function in their top two...so J's either use Te or Fe very strongly, and are thus big on organizing their external environment (Fe around community, Te around optimization), and so, *as a simple stereotype*, there are plenty of P's that value organization or are organized.  And plenty of J's that might be disorganized.  This is nothing but a stereotype.

The scores you get on a test are just an indication of how well the test finds you to line up to the stereotype.  Just because you get only 1% T preference doesn't mean you're on some borderline of T/F...it just means the test can't figure you out.  

Guess what?  **People aren't stereotypes**


INTJ and INTP, J means Judging function is extroverted, so INTJs have Te (and thus Ni).  I means Introverted function is dominant, so INTJs are Ni and Te in that order.  But P means extroverted perceiving process, so INTPs have Ne (and thus Ti).  And since introverted function is still dominant, they are Ti dominant, then Ne.

INTJ: Ni &gt; Te &gt; Fi &gt; Se
INTP: Ti &gt; Ne &gt; Si &gt; Fe

In fact

Many of you will be mistyped because tests are so frequently inaccurate.

I have seen other instances as well of people on this subreddit talking like they are just unarguably geniuses and everyone else is just stupid or incapable of thinking on the same level as them. I think it might have something to do with our personality type being labeled ""mastermind"". People take a couple of Myers-Briggs tests and suddenly think they are the shit. We are supposed to be introspective. We look at the world critically and skeptically, some of the things I have heard come from so called INTJs on this subreddit might make me think twice before associating myself with that attitude in the future.

- The ones that don't wear a 'social mask' (perceiver INTJs)
- The ones that do wear a social mask (contributor INTJs) 

There are other variations, because they are always wearing some form of public mask, and always playing the social game, whereas their INTJ perceiver peers denounce such things. 

**Perceiver INTJs** 

- Hate social games
- They don't respect authority at all unless its proven itself
- They have a strong moral compass, i.e. wearing the ""social mask"" feels dirty, because it is deceptive and not who they really are. 
- While most like *things*
- They do not care what society thinks of them. 

**Contributor INTJs**

- Contributor INTJ's *do* care about what society thinks of them. They wear lots of social masks
- They key to understand why they do this
- They care more about possessions because things help them get other things; contributor INTJ's do well in sales and business.    
- Respect authority more because they take-on social roles when it is necessary. 
- Because they are incredibly goal-based

**Frequently Asked Questions**

[...]

**Q: My INTJ is trying to take over the world. Should I be concerned?**

A: Remember

**Q: My INTJ just told me I’m retarded. Should I take offense?**

A: You probably are retarded

**Q: My INTJ isn’t sensitive to my feelings. Should I take offense?**

A: We aren’t even sensitive to our own feelings. Why should we be expected to be sensitive to yours? We won’t even try to fake it. Insincerity is a pet peeve of ours

**Q: Why doesn’t my INTJ ever show emotions or feelings?**

A: Because he doesn’t have any. Actually, and there are also many touching moments in some of the Star Trek movies. An INTJ may also smile or laugh at random for no apparent reason; probably one of the voices in his head just made a good joke.

[...]

**Q: I have this REALLY good idea… should I tell an INTJ?**

A: Sleep on it… for a week or so. If it’s still so appealing

**Q: Is it dangerous to annoy an INTJ?**

A: First we will ignore you, yes, it can be dangerous to annoy an INTJ.

[...]

**Q: My INTJ keeps disappearing. Is this normal?**

A: Yes. We need our “alone time” to recharge, we will retreat into our minds.) Consequently we have great stealth capability; we can sit in a corner, observing while being unobserved, and we can escape, unnoticed, when we’re ready to move on.

**Q: Why can’t my INTJ remember anything?**

A: This is normal. Most of us INTJs are very forgetful. We have too much going on in our heads at any time to remember a lot of new stuff. Also

[...]

**Q: My INTJ is very pedantic.**

A: Strictly speaking

**Q: Dammit

A: Yes

**Q: And sarcastic as hell

A: Sarcasm is a free public service we provide to those within earshot. No need to thank us. We also do irony, one-liners, quick-witted observations and flippant remarks, and abstract and deep philosophical insights on nonsensical themes. Our sense of humor tends to be dry, warped, and morbid, and not everybody “gets” us.

**Q: Why does my INTJ just start nodding and smiling after we’ve been talking for a couple of minutes?**

A:

**Q: I said

A: [ hey, Way None Went… ]

**Q: Hello? Are you going to answer any more questions?**

A: [ … “Hair Salon For Stray Nerd Nuns”, “Harry Potter’s Gay Stepson”, … ]

**Q: Asshole. I’m outta here.**

Honestly if you're still on this subreddit and you haven't read about your [cognitive functions](http://personalitycafe.com/intj-articles/91946-ni-te-fi-se.html) then you probably shouldn't be posting anything

We have 2 auxiliary cognitive functions: Fi and Se.

Fi, connecting logical perspective on one's role in their world. It'll help them feel more connected to the people around then, no matter their personality.

Se, but IMO most important function that we could develop. As INTJ's we are all too familiar with the constant mind-chatter that never stops, no matter where you are or what you are doing. Extraverted Sensing is a function that calls for a mute button for your thoughts. It's a wind-in-your-hair, eyes shut, quiet function that simply calls for you to stop thinking so hard and just take a leap of faith by not drawing logical conclusions all of the time. Se is the hardest function for an INTJ to develop because we often lack the tools to develop it, since our other 3 functions are at least slightly based in logic.

**#2. Be Strategic.** Strategy is, how to take not enough of something--time, energy, money, people--and use it for advantage in your current situation. If you've got to knock out Ali in the boxing ring it will require much different use of resources than to knock out the town drunk. 
  

**#3. Systems.** Not all INTJs are alike, but what? Where is this headed and how can I make it better? 
  

**#4. Since you know systems
  

**#5. If you don't know where to start, and lose the thread, and get confused. 
  

**#6. Everything is a Case Study.** Don't waste a single opportunity. Everything around you can give you further and further insight on what MAY BE happening, patterns, and interactions) all around you. Everything you do or see can help you in this. 
  

**#7. Yes, we don't really care if some SF comes by and says it must not be right because it doesn't fit with some model they have. 
  

**#8. When Things Go Wrong.** When times get hard, you may not be able to get your mind to turn off and go to sleep. 
 

Just be careful is all. Follow the pattern out in your head to see where it is going

I found this in another INTJ message board which was talking about INTJ correlations with Schizoid PD. Evidently someone told this to an INTJ in explaining how he is different than other people. 

I have problems in social interactions because I don't put on a mask with people. They know where they stand with me and despite liking you or not; I will call you out. People can't handle that.

First off, so everything I say will just be wild speculations. I think the first thing I noticed was that all of you are (not surprisingly) very different. At the same time, there seems to be something with your eyes that a lot of you have in common. Someone said something about this in a comment, and I think it might be so. It is hard to put my finger on what it is, though, but I recognize it a lot from the INTJs I know in real life. It is this kind of observing look in your eyes that says ""come on then, impress/surprise me"". That look makes me want to do precisely that too, because there is nothing like a happily surprised INTJ :) well, it is hard to make stuff out from pictures.

In the past few days I've read and heard a lot about INTJs not being emotionally connected to others, then you're not an INTJ personality type, but one more emotionally centered. Now I think that's bunk. I know this doesn't apply to everyone but the notion is just irritating, that some people might think this.


What I came to understand was that the INTJ was not a robot, as the wheels in their head are always turning and processing. Emotion just may not register visibly or until later on, after all the information has been sufficiently churned into the realm of disinterest. Or perhaps, as in my case, you're so immersed in your thoughts and ideas that you barely recognize what's going on around you, and have a slow response to your surroundings.


But when I'm coherent enough to listen to people ramble on about something, or somebody heckles them and they're not gutsy or witty enough to rebuke the insults thrown their way. I'm not gonna go up there and defend them, but the utter lack of finesse on the presenter's part, or the forgotten manners of the audience tend to stir me emotionally. It's awkward for everyone and it's a waste of time. It doesn't show but I'll be damned if I don't *feel* something, whether an impatient churning in my gut or a roll of my eyes, it's there.

Just because this type is supposed to be very systematic, and it's just as annoying as the ""my INTJ is acting up, need help"" posts, as if it's some kind of disease whose symptoms you need to treat. I'm an INTJ, but Christ, I'm not a sociopath.",,,,

Feelers answer what they WANT to hear, and perceivers give themselves the benefit of the doubt and do the same thing so they aren't judging themselves to harshly.

INTJs on the other hand love order, think realistically about our previous behavior, make judgments about it, and answer Yes/No questions.

The Meyers-Briggs typology system has been consistently disregarded in mainstream psychology literature. It is claimed that the number of people who consistently obtain the same test result is not statistically significant. I propose that the reason for this is the fact that the farther one gets away from the INTJ paradigm, would have an even higher one, and an INTP would have an even higher one.

To clarify now, I expect myself to do something absolutely incredible with my life. Something truly worth my one existence on this earth. Yet I find myself wasting hours on Reddit and Facebook and hating myself for it, or questioning the entire merits and effectiveness of mass education and then hating myself for not doing better at school (I do quite well but not near what I believe my potential to be). And then I question if it is even worth it and if I would be better off playing video games all day and working at McDonalds. Or even more abstract things like the notion of suicide (just a melancholic thought, not a real attempt or anything). I do not know what I want to do when I finish school, I find interest in too many things, it just seems incredibly boring spending 3-4 years studying one thing. In the end, as a result of following through this existential thought to its logical and real life conclusion

If you are interested in purchasing the book, I'm posting *Gifts Differing* descriptions because I want to better inform this sub-reddit. Yay for introverted feeling. Post how much you identify with each of the qualities or if you don't

Chapter 9: Descriptions of the Sixteen Types 
Page 109 

""**Introverted Intuitive Types 
INTJ and INFJ** (They describe them together) 

* Are driven by their inner vision of the possibilities 
* Are determined to the point of stubbornness
* Are intensely in individualistic
* Are stimulated by difficulties
* Are willing to concede that the impossible takes a little longer-but not much 
*Are more interested in pioneering a new road than in anything to be found along the beaten path 
*Are motivated by inspiration, invention, political, or industrial empire-building, social reform, teaching, writing, philosophy
* Are deeply discontented in a routine job that offers no scope for inspiration
* Are gifted
As with all introverts, the INTJ would be primarily interested in controlling the damage, but the INFJ’s primary concern would be crew’s welfare. They agreed that she was right. 

Among the research scientists and design engineers, they appear to be just as good. In an academic setting, INFJs may be even better, probably because feeling is more eager to meet a teacher’s demands, whereas thinking is likely to criticize the way a course in conducted and refuse to bother with items it considers irrelevant. 

Thinking or feeling judgment is vitally necessary

Their greatest gifts comes directly from their intuition—the flashes of inspiration, the originality, the access to resources of the unconscious, the ingenuity, and the visions of what could be. These are all inner gifts on the perceptive side. Without a developed auxiliary judging process, they will have little or no development of an outer personality and equally limited use of the gifts (euphemism for functions). However, a good judging process in support will shape the intuitive perceptions into conclusions or actions that will have a sound impact on the outer world. 
Van der Hoop recognized this problem: 

There is a peculiar difficulty, therefore, for people of this type to attain through their education a technique of expression…. 

(Van der Hoop continued) The development of this type is slower and more than arduous than that of most other people… Such children are not very amenable to influence from their environment. They may have periods of uncertainty and reserve, they may manifest an astonishing self-will and obstinacy. As a result of the intensely spontaneous activity within, they are frequently moody, occasionally brilliant and original, then again reserved, stubborn and arrogant. 

(Still continued) In later life, that while on the one hand they possess great determination, on the other hand they find it very difficult to express what they want. Although they may have only a vague feeling about the way they want to go, and of the meaning of their life, they will nevertheless reject with great stubbornness anything that does not fit in with this. They fear lest external influences or circumstances should drive them in a wrong direction, and they resist on principle. (1939, p 48) 

It follows that these people cannot be successfully coerced. They will not even be told anything without their permission, or theories, for free consideration; the excellence of their understanding must be trusted to recognize what is true.” 

There are sections “Introverted Intuition Supported by Thinking” and “Introverted Intuition Supported by Feeling”

On to the functions. 

Disclaimer. Peter and or Isabel Meyers do not provide the introverted and extroverted version of each function. I could have sworn they did

*It is a working title. Any suggestions to a better one

So I’ve never done this before

The theme might be a tad philosophical




**Social Interactions and views on society as a whole.**

As I have known for a while I am an INTJ. Over the years I’ve been very social, “I was shy” “I didn’t know anyone”. It is nothing like that. My reasons for not going to things like that are that people who normally tend to those functions are attention seeking dumb idiots ( I would like to swear , and I have in the past about it). I have developed a refined taste for not bothering to go to places like that. The more I think about it, the stupider it seems. 
Case in point: Nightclubs…..Now during Uni (chemistry grad) I went to a few, NO redeeming features going to places like that and I do not see the appeal at all, I cannot talk, even shout to other people, I cannot enjoy ANYTHING, as people are throwing up and fucking everywhere. It’s a madhouse and I don’t see why I would pay 10£/$/€ just to get in and listen to some shit “flavour of the month” music that has been pumped through the radio 56 times that morning. People do not seem to admit the real intentions for going to places like nightclubs. They say to “dance”. Well that’s all well and good, until you see them doing filthy shit to strangers

People seem to have this tendency to not acknowledge true intentions and just wing it

Its funny most relationships that are sprung from places like that don’t last 10 years. My parents are prime examples of that. This can be correlated to those rubbish magazines you see in hairdressers. All that relationship rubbish. Total waste of time. The lot of it.
You see men and women dressed like sluts/Morons, because, X was sleeping with X and his friend X was with this other person and when someone tells me this the next day I have to look with INTEREST? And say, “oh yea poor them” etc. I cannot fully comprehend how stupid people really are. The whole drama tires me when I hear it.
It really put things into perspective, that is?




**Careers and the point of it all.**

When I hear some saying they have a job in Sales, I want to die. They seem really enthusiastic when they say it, and I find it hard to take them seriously. I mean fuck, what they do all day; try to reach “sales” targets, come up with new marketing bullshit angles, another job type that just screw people out of money.  It just seems so pointless, why/ what is the point, you have to climb it to get to the top, but you don’t care as long as that you reach that sales goal by the end of the year! Then down the road you Play golf at 45 with some other dickheads that don’t really like you and only care about making money. But you don’t mind, in your very nice middle-upper-class estate) and secretly resenting you.  Now I ask that person this

My real gripe is really when these people criticize me for X reasons. It’s very hard to hold back your tongue as your arguments



**Educational Views**

Now another side issue and more related to me is that I want to go back into education. (Study Theoretical/Astro physics). People just look at me thinking I’m crazy, from the bottom.” But my argument is, “why not?” I mean they are just sitting there all day doing fuck all of a job, doing the same  thing day in day out (Relatively). Generally nothing interesting. Might get a promotion at some stage, but it stops eventually somewhere down the road. Where with me I might not make a lot of money (Infact I would be losing it) Working in some shitty shop or something just trying to makes ends meet during college again, but I would be doing something worthwhile. When I die (Unless I get involved with life extension or something in the future) I can’t take any of this rubbish with me. Money and possessions will not matter in the last few minutes of my life. But an amazing experience is what I’ll be left with and hopefully a loving family that I care about and all the memories I have of them. That is what I’ll be left with until draw my last breath. That will be my heaven.

Now, never absolutes) they 

Spending time, science and history.  Not ignoring them and making them go to “Law” School  Because it’s a job that will make money. What a fucking waste of a life. Its unacceptable.

*This is only half of what I wanted to say and it’s not expressed as coherently as I had hoped

Oh I must mention that none of the examples are related to me
 I’m not bitter about life. I’m fairly happy

**TL;DR** why is the world full of dumb idiot people who just want to make money and fuck all the time. Why is there a lack of desire for a higher purpose/ambition in life? (Not God related)

The first time I took the test I found out I was an INTJ. Not knowing what this meant, it was probably working in the same way as a horoscope, with random generalizations that could apply to anyone and appealing to confirmation bias.

I decided to put it to the test. I made 3 categories: (1) Things that apply to me. (2) Things that could apply to anyone. (3) Things that don't apply to me.

Then I read every statement on the INTJ description, most where on section (1) with only a few on section (2) and even less on (3). Of course, this proved nothing. To make it more solid I had to put other types to the test as well so I could compare the results. I tried ENTJ and INTP. Being two of the closest types, they had the best chance to match the results of INTJ. What I found was pretty interesting. A lot of the points from (1) shifted to (3), with (2) remaining about the same. There were still many traits that applied to me on section (1), which makes sense considering that the types are more of a balance, rather than a binary system.

Finally, and then it hit me: ""I'm fucking analyzing an online test and scrutinizing myself for confirmation bias. Of course I'm an INTJ.""

Now, that's not really the point of the story.

The issue with Ni is that we, when we're wrong, we can start looking for evidence to fit it.  This is an easy trap for the INTJs.

I've debated with both INTJs and INTPs that were wrong in the past.  And I've been wrong before.  I feel like INTPs who find themselves in the wrong and can't accept it start trying to cloud the discussion

But INTJs who find themselves in the wrong and can't accept it start going in circles; they're so sure their giant Ni picture can't be wrong that any criticism of their Ni picture must be wrong because that criticism makes the whole picture fall apart and the whole picture is so complex it *must* be right.  Then they start grasping at anything that casts doubt on the criticism and then move on to something else that ""proves them right"" and go in circles and end up looking extremely thick.

I actually prefer debating with a stubborn INTJ to a stubborn INTP for this reason

As I was showering this morning I realized that I very often have 'emotional' speeches in the shower. I talk to people in my life and tell them everything I so dearly want to say to them in person. And get quite in touch with my feelings

But that's is usually where it stays; in the shower. And when I see my subjects in person, how I feel about them, what they mean to me, etc. 

I guess it has something to do with a 'fear' of rejection of sorts, but then when we would be together, I would once again shut down.

Does anyone else experience things similar to this?

And are there any tips


**TLDR: Does anyone else have very articulate conversations about feelings etc while taking a shower? Any tips to put these 'experiences' in practice?**

*Disclaimer: I'm a 25 year old male university-student, ever since my girlfriend left me for being inaccessible. Please pardon any grammatical mistakes.* 

**Edit 1: Thank you all for your replies

I sense that we all seem to bottle things up inside ourselves, and not adequately expressing myself is hurting me. My general consensus is that I like to think that people around me know how much I care for them, without me expressing that. I guess that is not an healthy way per se. 

Also I read couple of times, because we ourselves aren't that needy for constant appreciation. But I do think that that view is flawed, but I say that purely on personal thoughts and experiences.

**It would be ideal if there was some sort of handbook that would help guide us in expressing ourselves in a way that isn't to scary or to troublesome

So you're born. You're raised

I am currently studying Molecular Biology and Microbiology at my university and I love the material. I am lazy at times and find pleasure in imagining a utopian society where everything is perfect. I guess my goals include helping the human race achieve perfection. I am bothered however that not many people in the world care as much about these things as I do. After college I plan to start a business which will generate enough income to allow me to start a biotech company. I expect some of my plans to come to fruition if I put in enough hard work.

Being (or pretending/aspiring to be) emotionless definitely isn't useful to the human species since we all have emotions and if you want to contribute to a species of emotional people

1- The first is get better friends/surround yourself with better people so that you may get attached. I just don't think that's the answer. The reason I would call some people ""good"" friends is that they were the only ones to talk to me after I had left any actual reason to talk to them, and I like hearing different sides of the story in order to strengthen my argument for when it matters.

In other words they tolerate me without having any reason to... (Since I am usually told I am an asshole...) and I do not actively care to get/keep new friends...

2- The second which says don't care, or were you just faking it like me... (although I have never faked a close relationship except to parents and even that makes me feel bad.) Kind of like the saying; ""Don't knock it till you tried it"".

**Big**

I am the only person I am always with. Be nice.

A depression-free me exists. If I forget that

Learn and follow my own rules.

These mental extremes should be avoided; others hurting my pride

Happiness can't be based on ""at least I'm not"" or ""at least I have"" comparisons.

Reread and rewatch my favorite movies or books.

Dated entries are shit compared to non-dated.

**Productivity**

Do not be all or nothing.

New Material motivates.

Do not underestimate preparing and planning.

Inspiration is fleeting. Do not focus on others' inspiration.

It's good to keep a lot of pokers in the fire.

Set things (interviews


**Coping**

If you have to do something

If I am stressed

Counter-intuitively

Rumination leads to depressions. Distractions can be good.

Exposure does not change. Acting / thinking differently during the exposure does.




**Hope**

Things will change

**Relating**

Individuals experience time differently. How does this effect others actions?

Some lay people are enlightened

I am as susceptible to ""the good life"" falsity as those in third world countries.

Our large

People basically act towards everyone the same way

The best salesmen make people think they are doing them (the people) a favor.

Think of the people around the people who standout.


**Socializing**

Books are social

Close relationships are important for happiness

When I meet someone I like

All interactions are not beneficial to minimizing loneliness.


**Pain**

If you have pain











**Peace**

Avoid long-term obligations if possible. 

Don't fear quitting.

I am happiest when things are quiet

Don't create unnecessary obstacles for yourself.

Recognize subtle anger.

Meditation can be done throughout the day.

Being able to think clearly is thanks to such fine-tuned calibrations.

Alone time is an oasis.


**Decisions**

Admiring an activity is not always the same as wanting to do it.

A test to know if I really want to do something is to ask ""would I start right now?"".

Commercials sell lifestyles. Will buying or doing this actually change my lifestyle?


**Mood**

If I don't like my mood...wait a while.

Moods are like weather or like waves

Continuing the analogy

Large periods of time are remembered as a single mood. There are much more divisions.








**Happiness**

""The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness."" - Eric Hoffer

I am a hedonist

A sad genius is an oxymoron - thought from Daniel Tammet?

Happiness is a skill that can be improved.

Memories are recreated each time they are recalled. Enhance them.


**Meaning**

All meanings are human invention. Ben Franklin's the beauty of being a creature of reason. Morality is subjective.

The ultimate purpose is death. Any passage of time is heading in the right direction.

**TL;DR:** I believe that my brain's dopamine-producing mechanisms are somehow deficient. If I had to guess

My reasoning is as follows:

Dopamine is said to be the brain's ""pleasure chemical"". I seem incapable of experiencing strong positive emotions. Every once in a while I see people on TV screaming in joy (e.g.: because they won the lottery). I'm quite sure nothing could elicit that response in me. When my girlfriend bought me a trip to Paris, that I was ""cold"".

I have a tendency for mild depression. Sometimes I feel like everything, it feels like my brain's capability for happiness is temporarily depleted. I don't automatically feel sad, I just feel incapable of feeling happy, and the only way my mood can go is down. My theory is that when this happens, it's because my brain has become (temporarily) incapable of producing sufficient amounts of dopamine. When this happens, caffeine can sometimes provide a mood boost, quite possibly because [caffeine](http://www.livestrong.com/article/317519-dopamine-caffeine/) causes dopamine to be released

Dopamine is associated with [extroversion](http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/5060/) and ""reward-seeking behavior"". Most of the time, quite possibly because of its amphetamine content). This was a revelation. I was in a loud nightclub once (something usually anxiety-inducing), and suddenly, I felt as comfortable as if I were lying on my couch at home in my pajamas. I could talk to anyone, without shyness or fear, and I enjoyed it. For a few hours, I was an extrovert.

I never seem to get ""crushes"" on anyone (get infatuated). In fact

I'm one of those people that tend to have difficulty reaching orgasm (takes a while). There is a strong tie between orgasm buildup and dopamine.

Finally, my tendency for depression, and a [deficient dopamine mechanism](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dopamine_and_schizophrenia) (hypothesized to be a possible cause for schizophrenia).",,False,,t5_2qowo,,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/12mzwl/on_joy_introversion_and_dopamine/

On the other hand

I guess I should mention the event that inspired me to post this. Yesterday I ended up in a small-ish group of people during [an event that typically attracts the geeky types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_vs_Zombies), it felt like I wasn't wanted. I was a lot quieter than usual, and I'm pretty sure I overheard someone say ""I forgot he was here"" in reference to me.

I don't think this is happening because extroverts just talk more so I have more chances to respond, because in my lone-wolfing I've overheard a lot of discussions that I would do great in.

**1. Get distracted easily, have to take breaks to move.**
I'm not talking about complete ADHD, but a lot of times I walk into a room, see something shiny, and leave, but then I remember what I was doing again. Also, when I'm working on something, even something I'm pretty passionate about, stretch, and I completely forgot for a couple seconds. Maybe it was the pressure of people watching

**2. Have trouble believing people's comments and praising**
As a kid, when my mom or a teacher would tell me things like 'you're very smart, I know it, you're just not living up to your full potential' in my head I would be like 'would you still be saying that if my feelings or your job didn't matter?' (I never said these things because I knew I wouldn't get a straight answer).

**3. Not always see people as 'people'**
This might be hard to explain, I only observe their behavioral patterns. Sometimes it's different than that though. Sometimes in my head it's more like '*day 38. I am convinced that I have scouted out a potential suitable companion. Tomorrow I shall approach it slightly less subtly, and attempt interaction.*' And the first time we got our GPA rankings, I only saw people as their numbers (which they eagerly announced).

**4. Mentally see movement of numbers and objects**
This might be something specific to my brain, when I look out into a field, I see planes(in the mathematical sense) and I wonder things like 'if this plane could pick out insects and only insects, and it shifted upwards through the ground, would there be millions and millions, or are there just a few solitary ones? A better example is probably the way I do mental math. I rarely show my work if I don't have to (even though I still forget to carry ones and such) because I can 'see' the numbers shift and turn and flip from positive to negative, less than to greater than.

**5. Whisper gibberish when concentrating**
If I wore a microphone while doing math that required a lot of multiplying and dividing, but what I assume is my extroverted thinking makes me need to hear myself to get my thoughts clear. I don't always say everything I'm doing though, and sometimes I just repeat numbers until I know what to do with them. This is what I probably sound like during a math test: *eight twelve six one three three three thirty six fourteen fourteen fourteen fourteen negative six and a quarter divide... *

**6. Not like having people expect things of you**
I don't want people to always think I'll be right or get the highest test score. I'd rather people notice little things like a good point I made or something. Don't get me wrong, I don't want people to think something has gone terribly wrong in my life (a teacher actually asked me once if everything was going ok at home when I was in 5th grade and I was pretty shocked).

**7. Not want to get too cocky**
This probably goes a little with point 2, I don't always share these ideas and observations with people, so people probably aren't sharing theirs either. I know that INTJs have a reputation of being all elitist, considering themselves the 'master race', and to be honest, I find it fun to play along with that on the internet, but not in real life.

**8. Not actually act like a jerk all of the time**
I know a lot of you probably don't care what others think of you, maybe my functions are more balanced, but even though I'm pretty straightforward, I try to avoid conflict. When working as a team, in my mind, we don't have to get along, we just have to cooperate.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/zp3kt/dae_dump/

What prompted me to post this was a surge of emotion that I experienced after randomly stumbling onto r/relationshipadvice. I became engulfed in the stories of infidelity and my blood started to boil; I then fell deep into thought. 

For most of my life, and my justifications have evolved over time. First, I thought it was because my parents are a miserable ""couple"" who remain married to this day purely for financial reasons. I thought it was because their relationship left a bitter taste in my mouth. Then, I thought it was a negative reaction towards my low self esteem, i.e. I convinced myself that I didn't want anyone. I had ugly duckling syndrome all throughout high school, but ever since college I've found out that I'm very aesthetically pleasing to a lot of women...haha.  Again, there are a lot of reasons for my disdain towards marriage and long-term relationships, long-lasting intimate relationships are simply irrational.

I was reading stories of infidelity, 20 years is defying the odds of nature. Biologically, it is in our self interests to have multiple partners (this is not only true of men). Also, if I'm not mistaken, we INTJs are very forward-looking, future oriented thinkers. To me, it is not a rational to invest yourself in somebody else when the likelihood that they will cheat on you and betray your trust in the future is very high. Perhaps I have a warped view, 1 is the only stable number. Please understand (as I'm sure you do) that I am oversimplifying everything and that there are obviously holes in my argument that I am not mentioning. But you get the gist. 

The problem now, pick up the pretty girl at the bar, and initiate that blissful honeymoon period of relationship. It feels so damn good to hold another girl in my arms. Sometimes I become upset but then, like today, my rational side kicks in and reminds me not to invest in the risky female stock. It's not hard to refrain from doing so, because I am genuinely happy being alone. Again, sometimes I just have that biological yearning that I need to fight through until my testosterone levels off.

edit:



Now that I’ve had some time to think about things, I didn’t want to type at all. I was in some sort of pain. I want to avoid sounding pretentious or superficial when explaining my problems. Personally, I become annoyed at human problems that could be considered minute to others. To surmise my hardships, I would sum it up with me losing control of my own mind. Not being able to trust what my own judgment… I am not going to try and make major psychological evaluations on where my life went wrong. Basically I was verbally abused a lot as a child, either by my parents or peers at school. As a result of this I inevitably lost my self-confidence. I was also rejected once before when I was a lot younger. A combination of being excluded from everyone, verbally abused, and basically perceiving myself with negative connotations throughout my childhood gave me a negative outlook on life. I developed this bleak personality with a pessimistic spectrum to what reality is. I am now 18 and I have social anxiety issues, and am obviously shy. I have spent about a year of my life focusing on an ideal notion that I don’t even know to be true anymore. I have deceived myself to the point where I cannot make a logical rational thought concerning this matter. When I started my job, it could be completely one way or the other. I believe that because I cannot clearly assess the situation means that I am somewhat insane. I must be incredibly stupid to not be able to evaluate the situation. I want to avoid being an absolute fool and mislead myself


This whole problem that I face every day is just the start of the long list of problems that I do have. One of my other major problems is the lack of socializing with other people. I’d explain more thoroughly about what troubles me

I'm not even sure where I'm going with this but everywhere I look it just seems because someone claims to be an INTJ or ""introvert"" they say ""oh yeah

At worst MY experience has been complete awkwardness or maybe even low self esteem but I refuse to be *that guy* that never speaks or always at home posting how I hate people and life on Facebook all day. I actually DO want to be in charge in some social settings where I feel confident. I know this goes against a lot of what the INTJ description says but I like being the leader. 

I like for people to know I am able to do certain tasks or skills and I like being exposed to as much as I can. My motto is if you want things done right do them yourself and to lead by example. INTJ master race! If I'm good with computers

In my experience a lot of people give INTJs and introverts a bad reputation just because they themselves are socially lazy or other reasons due to them not putting in effort. Perhaps they *do* hate people for whatever reason but the longer I know them or read the reason the more I see it has nothing to do with being an introvert but some sort of anxiety issue or other life problem which we all do get.

Even I have low self esteem but I do not blame it on me being INTJ. I know the two are different issues. I think being arrogant and all of that goes along with other personality issues outside of INTJ. I'm not saying I am good at emotional expressions or a complete chatterbox with strangers but I just never understood the COMPLETE ""I hate people"" attitude. Can I ask why you guys feel this way?

Then recently a gf of one of my house mates said ""at first I thought you were weird but I realised you're actually quite funny"" but then there was a time I made a joke and she (and others) said ""oh wow you're normal.""

They called me weird again.

Another time was after I made some photos and photoshopped myself in multiple places. Then the other night I was drinking with some friends and one of them (any guesses?) said ""oh

Around 9:30pm my roommate went to go buy some groceries. As soon as she got back home, but nobody did. I caught on fairly quickly that something wasn't right so despite the fact that I had a paper due at midnight, I dropped what I was doing to find out what was going on.

She hung up and had no idea what was going on. She tried to pack a bag but she couldn't. She could sense that something was wrong and it was frustrating her that nobody would tell her. She wanted to know why her mom was driving over here so late to pick her up. I did feel that it was odd that nobody would tell her anything about her dad

After we packed, she just started saying over and over, ""I don't know what's going on. I don't know where my dad is. I hope it's not what I think it is. I HOPE IT'S NOT WHAT I THINK IT IS."" I feel bad that she is living with someone (me) who doesn't know how to handle people emotions easily, but I tried my best. 

I made sure she drank some water

I figured that her boyfriend might need to know what was going on, he managed to distract her by asking what she did that day, and by making her tell him everything. I made the mental note that this is a good technique to use in the event that I have to deal with a friend who is going through the same thing again. (I really hope I never have to again, but if any of you do, REMEMBER. Take their mind off of what is going on and make them tell you every detail about their day. I feel so stupid that I didn't think of that before, but I guess now I know)

They talked for a while, her mom squat down and tried to comfort her. The mom's friend came over to me, and I mouthed *what happened?!* and she quietly told me that her dad was killed. She didn't say died. She said KILLED. I asked how, and she told me that he was shot. I went into instant tear mode. Meanwhile, my roommate is begging for her mom to tell her what happened and the mom finally let it out. 

I hope none of you ever have to watch a mother tell her daughter that her father was murdered. That he was shot in the chest. Shot in the chest by her sister's HUSBAND. I hope you never have to watch as your friend and roommate cries out.

""HE SHOT MY DAD HE SHOT MY DAD""

""WHERE IS MY DAD?""

""NO NO IT WASN'T MY DAD! IT WASN'T MY DAD! WHERE IS DAD?""

I hope you never have to see it. 

I checked her phone to see if her boyfriend had texted or called

I continued to watch my roommate's struggle in understanding that this was really happening. I finished preparing her bags and set them by the door. I set my oscillating fan to blow in the three of them. I gave them tissue paper. And I waited what seemed forever for her boyfriend to show up. I ran outside when I saw he was here and told him that I didn't know if it was the right thing to tell him but that I did it anyways. He ran up the stairs and I watched as he comforted her and she cried to him. 

*As an aside: Despite the extreme tragedy of it all, their foreheads touching. Him trying to understand her and to be there for her.*

Anyways, I just couldn't do it. I didn't know what to do. She's taller than me but I gave her hugs and rubbed her back. I did my best to comfort her.  But it was so hard to do. It made me realize that I need to seriously learn how to do that stuff. She had 3 other family members die this past summer.

I did all this when an ESFJ claimed he was an INTJ

&gt;1. The most common test I've found, despite the fact that INTJ's are somewhere less than 3% (numbers vary by source. Information difficult due to rarity of person)

&gt;2. INTJs are listed as ""the smartest and most self confident"" without listing any of their disabilities (extreme frustration, etc). Thus, people read them as ""Masterminds are the best"" and go with that.

&gt;3. Most people take the tests with what they want to be in mind. For example, so the example isn't great).

&gt;4. Type descriptions are rather complex. For example, but in practice those differences lead to conflict between the two. Thus, reading a description and saying ""that's me"" or ""That's cool. I want to be that"" is a serious cause of bias.

&gt;5. INTJs are one of the rarest groups (right there with rationals in general.) Of the rationals, people like to be unique, which, in great irony, leads almost everyone to list themselves as the same thing.

&gt;In my experience

&gt;I still get the MBTI of all my friends, as the biases involved made it impossible to use.

The amount of ENTPs and INTPs that are mistyped as INTJ is very high.  Seriously.  Take a good hard look at what kind of bias you employ in your test-taking or even in your day to day decision making after learning about MBTI.  I began under the impression that I was an INTJ, as is the avoidance of dogma--it's just not as reflexive with my cognitive function set as it may be for an INTJ.  Eventually, as I became more educated in cognitive functions, I determined that I am a clear Ne-Ti combo.  This led me down the INTP path, which eventually led me down the ENTP path to where I am now, as I never could relate to the lack of external motivation or desire for excellence in INTPs.  I am quite a realistic person.  I like to see physical results.  That's not an INTP thing.  ENTPs are the *most likely* extraverted type to have introverted tendencies, be it due to a certain level of Ne alienation

So

First thing's first
[INTJ](http://www.personalitynation.com/intj/3480-intj-jungian-cognitive-function-analysis.html)  
[INTP](http://www.personalitynation.com/intp/3509-intp-jungian-cognitive-function-analysis.html)  
[ENTP](http://www.personalitynation.com/entp/5508-entp-jungian-cognitive-function-analysis.html)  
[Another good resource.](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/)

Once that's done, I instantaneously shoot off into 10 different directions of seeking alternative perspectives or how it could be humorous.  Extraverted functions are self contained, requiring no internalized system to process information.  They are objectively focused.  Ti, on the other hand, is contemplative.  It requires an ""algorithm,"" if you will, to run the information through.  Ni is contemplative as well.  The ""aha moment"" thing is bullshit, then arguments to run information through.  You have to run the information through that subjective and internalized system before it comes together and makes sense.  Te does not work the same way.  It springs off tangentially like Ne.  Ti-Ne-Si combinations are also much more the ""grammar nazi

Secondly, I was the kid that had stellar academic performance, but without failure was noted as being loud and disruptive on every report card.  That's the zaniness of Ne right there.  INTJs and INTPs, on the other hand, were most likely *least* outspoken when they were younger, not developing their hand with Te or Ne until their teen years.  Think about what direction you took as you hit age 11 or 12.  A Te auxiliary will typically become more focused on making sense of their somewhat incomprehensible Ni at around that age, where a Ti auxiliary will typically become more focused on themselves, where it previously was all about the world around them.  An Ne auxiliary may become more zany

Thirdly, and 4w5 are more typical INTJ types, but that's not to say that it's impossible.  I am 5w6, 1w9, 3w2, which is a very typical, yet more introverted ENTP type.  5w6 hints at xNTP, 1w9 is a somewhat introverted type

**Edit:** A comment that I made here is something that I think contributes very much to this post

&gt;While MBTI is simply a deductive ""you do this, and the description pretty much reiterated how I answered the questions, so how could you possibly refute that?"" vs. ""I have a penis in between my legs, therefore I am a male."" ""MBTI testing"" is like the former, whereas Jungian cognitive function analysis is like the latter.

So I'll ask for your help directly

I am really, jot down ideas, reddit, brainstorm, etc.  

What my SO doesn't understand is that I need this time to recharge my batteries.  I don't spend too many days consecutively with ANYONE

Some background:
* Relationship approaching 2.5 years
* Was a long distance relationship.  I moved to be with her.  
* I do love her very much
* We live apart
* I see her several times a week on average.  Normally spend entire weekends with her.
* Unsure of my SO's personality type

This afternoon she wanted to hang out outside as it was a really nice day.  I am actually very outdoorsy closer to the summer, and began to text me later, complaining about how I ""expected her to disappear"" so I could have my alone time.  We had hung out I'd say for 90% of the prior week (she caught a cold and I just moved to the area and am looking for a job, so I was able to visit her), and she slept over on Saturday night, too.  

I very much need time to be by myself - I immensely enjoy it and I think I'd go off the deep end if I couldn't do that.  She

Any advice for me on how to help her understand that this is important to me?  Any more information you would need to help understand the situation?

EDIT: Formatting - fairly new to Reddit

EDIT: Also
  
**UPDATE:** Thanks to one and all for the advice.  I have only had the chance to respond to one comment thus far, that I sometimes need to be by myself and that she shouldn't consider this as as sign of disinterest.  I further explained that I have been this way my entire life, and often prefer isolation to interaction, even with close friends and family.  She was very understanding and appreciative, especially when I mentioned that I was feeling as though I put forth a great deal of effort to understand her feelings and compromise and she did not.  She agreed with me that this was the case and wanted to know how we could re-balance our relationship.

In my experience in this forum, and this seems to cause poor performance, which initiates deeper self-analysis, ad-infintum. As a corollary, I often experience a paradoxical sense of self consciousness: intensely present, but disconnected; and a primary feature of this state is very high mental verbalization. I came across this passage I thought you would all be interested in during my work.

&gt;A recent study by Wilson and Schooler (1991) provided further evidence that verbalization can increase the salience
of the verbalizable attributes of a stimulus and thereby overshadow
the nonverbalizable attributes. Wilson and Schooler
examined the effects of verbalizing affective judgments
which is another domain for which subjects are unable to
fully articulate their thought processes (Nisbett &amp; Wilson
1977). For example
evaluate different brands of strawberry jams. Control subjects
tasted the jams and then rated them
subjects tasted the jams and then wrote the reasons for their
preferences prior to rating them. When subjects' ratings were
compared with those of taste experts from Consumer Reports
it was found that the control subjects agreed quite well
with the experts
agreement. Wilson and Schooler concluded that verbalization
causes subjects to base their evaluations on the reportable
aspects of their taste experience and to ignore those
aspects that cannot be adequately expressed in words. In
support of this hypothesis
implied by subjects' written evaluations of the jams strongly
correlated with their ultimate ratings.

After reading through this, not enough death, so humans again play the roles of death makers to absolve the situation they got themselves in. My question throughout the book and afterwards has been centered around whether humanity should be seeking out these type of scientific discoveries (assuming it could be obtained one day). The controversy in my head comes from and ethical perspective and then one of science. 

As the nature of science goes, given the principles of the physical laws we live by and observe today, I can only assume that such a drastic change to the human populous overall (eradicating our aging process, or even substantially increasing life-expectancy) would be devastating to the Earth's ecosystems and ability to support a multitude of species. In addition to the fact that this would be a luxury, and not a necessity in the context of health care, the number and demographic of people that would be able to afford such a treatment to extend life, I would say that it would be very skewed and unethical towards the least fortunate in society. 

Even if we were to say that the use of such a treatment as immortality would be 'illegal' to receive/administer, invest in it, and strive harder to replicate it that eventually it will become a common thing, much like new technology today.

I'm not entirely sure if many truly understand what intelligence really is. I hear people claim they have

How is it quantified without bringing in the obscurity of IQs? And if it is so obscure, create, and conceive. Sure these actions may be observed in our external world but, if intelligence is a cerebral process, and many things we think are not externalized, it would be a foolish thing to rely on it to prove superiority as we don't know the full picture. What I am trying to say is that claiming intelligence is no different than claiming one is human.

Here I am, living room, and my room are messy because I can't muster up the motivation to clean. Nobody comes over anyways so what's the point? I'm in the process of finding somewhere else to live, and I have settled on a room in a 6 bedroom house where 5 other college students live. This place is super huge and the upstairs has the largest living area I have ever seen and 5 of the 6 bedrooms are upstairs, and 2 bathrooms, and a laundry room. I am moving because my lease is up, and because despite how introverted I am

Anyways, and I'm thinking about all the ""normal"" dating things people do and realizing that I haven't experienced them. I've never really been taken out on a date...sometimes a girl really does want to get all dressed and wear a nice dress and heels and be taken out. I kind of went out on a date somewhere around 16 months ago, but it ended up with me not being interested in the guy. I've never been given flowers. Now, I'm not a super materialistic girl at all, but it would be nice to experience a few things. 

Every once in a while I'll go on Facebook and I'll end up looking through the photos of people I used to know. They have photos of them with an SO dating back a few years and they look so damn happy in all of them. They've gone overseas with this person

A. What if I COULD be making those kinds of memories but I'm not because I'm always at home doing the same thing every night?

OR

B. What if there really is nobody out there for me and I'm not meant to have those kinds of memories? What if I'm just not going to get to travel with an SO

Then I start to think

I go out to a favorite bar with one of my girl friends and every time we go, he showed up but brought a friend. I'm not stupid. That friend was brought along to keep me company while the guy talked with my friend. It made me feel shittier than I would have felt if he had brought no friend for me. This wingman that was designated to me was cute, but kind of douchey, but I tried talking with him anyways. It didn't really work out once he figured out that I'm not some dumb airhead chick, and I could see him begin to struggle with how he was going to keep talking to me.

I want a genuine date. I want flowers and memories and travel

I'm not depressed by any means. I'm actually enjoying my beer and listening to some good music and having fun crocheting, and having someone worthy of my time around and feeling like I'm worthy of someone's time is something that I want too.

I am an ENFP to the core. I've taken the tests many times throughout my life and that is always my result. When I read about that type it describes me in a way that's uncanny.

I asked my boyfriend the other day if he'd take the test because I was curious what type he was. He obliged and found he is an INTJ. Reading about that type also really seems like it fits who he is.

So my question is what is it like for INTJ's to fall in love?

You can read my past posts if you are interested in the details of me telling my INTJ that I loved him for the first time if you are interested in the backstory.

But what it boils down to is my INTJ is almost 30 years old, but those differences only seem to make us both become better versions of ourselves. He absolutely fascinates me. The way he lives his life, the way he interacts with the world is so different than me that it draws me in. I don't know how to explain it, but upon reading about ENFP-INTJ pairs it is sort of starting to make sense.

So I am madly in love with this man. And from everything I've ever known of love

Can some INTJs chime in and let me know what love is like for them? Is it something you feel easily? Or can even feel at all? Is it hard for you to come to that place? Why?

After graduation however, rinse and repeat. I was the only one feeling this way though, my friends seemed completely happy continuing their seemingly meaningless and unfulfilled lives. I was far more interested in how societal structures work, politics and researching mathematics and physics. Whenever I brought up topics that I found insightful and inspiring I could tell that my friends were feigning interest. I couldn't handle the repetitiveness of their lifestyle and I became more secluded and introspective. 

I slowly lost contact with most of my high school friends, even if she didn't understand it entirely. As we grew closer we spent almost every day together, never tiring of each other's company for a second. She began to crave more and more social attention, which I was finding hard to keep up with as I had become very introverted by this stage.

I understand that there are a whole slew of challenges that I'll face in the future, I feel like I've met all the necessities of fundamental happiness such as food, shelter, social interaction, etc. Being in this position has also made me realize that the same things that used to make me happy before don't anymore. For example, something trivial like buying a gadget doesn't give me the same kind of joy or thrill that it used to.

I realize that I now value meaning in life a lot more than I value ""happiness"". Seeking meaning may require sacrificing or not being ""happy"" in the short term to make a contribution or impact that is felt throughout the world. For me, and requires dedication and sticking to it even when I'd rather be more momentarily ""happy"" by zoning out and watching more Scrubs on Netflix.

I told her I thought we worked great together and I asked her why she thought that and she said that she wanted to live from city to city when we were older and I didn't (we're in college and 20yrs old). I found this to be a bullshit excuse of a reason to end a 2 year completely committed relationship from day one.

I tried to avoid the topic but they (ppl i work with) eventually put me in a position where i would have to either lie and say that i would do these things

Every time a person creates a new lie like this they have to maintain it... sometimes for years. All to avoid offending/hurting someones feelings. Over the years there would be so many of these lies that the little lies they tell would eventually control them.

My visual of this is having a puppeteer continually adding strings in all directions. Eventually he becomes limited and eventually controlled by the pull of those strings.

I started asking girls out (guy here) as a freshman in high school and continued to do so half way through college. They all plain out said no

After 10 years of nothing but rejections

Every guy...EVERYONE, I had to come to the conclusion that women just don't find me attractive. The few women that I stupidly asked why they wouldn't go out with me gave some clues. My INTJ-ness was a turn-off. I ""thought too much, read too much, hardly ever talked, and when I did talk I use those big words no one else knows to talk about stuff no one understands or even cares about"" sums up what was ""wrong"" with me.
This realization lead to a dark time in my life

About a year after that I got interested in personality typing and came across MBTI and found out that I tested INTJ and what that supposedly means. [Note: I don't agree with MBTI in everything it says, in real life I assumed male INTJs just weren't desirable.

Nine years later, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm seeing this interest just because I *want* it to be there, not because it *is* there, just like I did back in high school and college. Being alone for the rest of my life is starting to bug me a little, I'm fine if it happens but rather it didn't.

How do other INTJs un-convince yourself of a conclusion that you yourself have made and has at least 12 years of evidence supporting it?

TL;DR How do other INTJs un-convince them self of a conclusion of a primal nature that they have thought about and made with ample evidence?

I did an Enneagram and got Type 3

In short: I care about work and only my work.  I evaluate people only by how good they are at their work.  The purpose of fun is to recharge you to do your work better than you would without it.  Despite this viewpoint, and use these events to make generate social capital.  This has always been true; the only thing that changed as I got older is that I got better at being perceived as a sexual mate instead of just a friend.   I took me about the age of 22 to figure that out (27 now), and I have nothing but sheer contempt for guys my age that still bitch about it because it frankly wasn't that hard to figure out, and I detest whiny people. 
  I am asked to come out with friends frequently

You're probably reading this and thinking I'm a douche.  That's fine; I readily acknowledge that I have an overblown ego.  What you might not appreciate is that if you  knew me in person, I will happily die for you, but that's 2-3 people at a time, and just because you enjoyed that status once doesn't mean you enjoy it now.  That I sincerely love someone for a brief period of time (a year at most), and then leave without a regret is what I believe makes me somewhat weird.  I believe this ties in my early childhood of moving around a lot because my father was in the Army.  I really do care for people for a short period of time, and then when I stop caring, move on to a new group of friends while maintaining loose contact with old friends.   Most people have told me that they feel very comfortable around me

I am most comfortable around strangers that I can talk to about their personal life.  I like knowing why people made the choices they made

My moods are extremely high when I'm feeling competent at my work, and am quite extroverted, though to be honest, I would rather be hanging out with strangers. When I'm  feeling shitty, I don't want to talk to anyone, and during one particularly rough time, I went a full year without hanging out with anyone except my significant other.     

I am athletic and good-looking (and clearly vain)  I think what matters about a person are their ideas, but I can't ignore that so much of the world is affected by completely arbitrary bullshit like how tall you are and what clothes you wear.  Consequently, I made sure to become extremely fit and extremely polished.  I am superficial not because I want to be, but because that's how you get ahead in the world; and I am not so presumptuous to think that the world should operate on the terms that I think are important. 

I have many to-do lists and those kinds of things, I suggest habitrpg and workflowy.  These two things have changed my life. 

  I get very angry with myself when I procrastinate (as I am doing now) or don't do things extremely well.  I often get depressed with how I sabotage myself, 34 on my MCAT, and while good, I have always been disappointed that they weren't higher.  I fantasize constantly about a day when I have enough time to study on the side and retake them because I am not happy with those scores.  I know; it's weird. 

I like science fiction and books like Freakonomics. Dune is my favorite Science fiction book.  East of Eden is the most beautiful book I have read, but fighting to keep other's hopes alive. 

I grew up in a very religious environment in Georgia, since I associate ""black-and-white"" morality with evil institutions. 

And I'm done.  I know some of this was toolish and kinda weird to state directly, I had to be pretty honest. I've also posted some argumentative type responses in other threads so you could see how I argue/think to see if that would be helpful.

•	Most people are better at formulating their ideas and opinions into words and are better able to recognize the multiple ways such a statement could be taken. As such, when someone asks me a question, I can be more worried about why they asked the question and all of the possible ways I could answer the question incorrectly. I do this because when I say the first thing that comes to mind, I usually offend.

**I have no standard of perfection on others or myself. I assume that we are all faulty in one way or another and that we are all failures in one sense or another. As such I do not fear failure


•	I often fail to realize that others do not see the world from this paradigm. I think that many believe that perfection is expected. Therefore they cope with their own failures by not looking at them


•	This is not to say that I will not have emotional turmoil if a new fault or failure is revealed to me that I previously was not aware of. Such a reaction is expected. However

**My personal decisions are often based off of critical judgment


•	I recognize that many people make their decision off of their “gut feeling”. This is very valuable for those whose perceptions are correct


•	I recognize that others often will not be receptive to my opinions/judgments if I merely give the reasons for them. This can be hurtful to me


**I wish to approach everyone in personal relationships as equals. I prefer an open forum of opinions where multiple desires can be expressed and then accepted or rejected without the loss of friendship.**


•	I have noticed that this can strain my relationships with others because many people want to be either a leader or a follower (either wanting to tell me what to do or wanting for me to tell them what to do). I am generally not willing to do either in a personal relationship setting. 


•	This can result in me expressing opinions that others view as critical and hurtful


•	This paradigm may be faulty as everyone is, hostility, or sadness. I am resistant to change this paradigm however, for when I try to shift from it I tend to view others as inferior, censor my true viewpoints around them, keep relationships shallow, and desire to not rely on others for anything that really matters. This allows me to have more ‘friends’


**If confronted with a request for emotional input on the spot


•	This leads to many misunderstandings with people for if I feel comfortable with someone or trust them to assume what my heart really is


**I often prefer to be independent, this is one instance where I tend to have a higher standard of others and will tend to only desire interdependence with those that I can expect to reliably give me the benefit of the doubt concerning my intentions. It should be noted that I do not equate interdependence with love, care, preference, or friendship. Rather I see it as having someone who I can go to who is a shelter for my own emotional state when I am in turmoil. Concerning interaction, I recognize that all individuals have different strengths and weaknesses and those that are different than me will have strengths where I would otherwise fail. I need these individuals as friends and brothers, and I am comfortable relying on these individuals in situations where I might otherwise be lacking. On a lighter interactional level, increase my desire to care for others


**I treasure individualism greatly. I want to be accepting of everyone’s differences and I want others to be accepting of mine. I want everyone to give each other the benefit of the doubt until negative intent is directly expressed. In a sense


•	I have sometimes offended others because when they tried to state that, why are you different this time?” I have responded bluntly with “no” or “because this is just how I feel right now”, respectively. Others seem to assume some hidden intent behind my change in actions that isn’t present. I sometimes become stressed trying to be consistent around others who might look for said hidden intent, trying to remember what it was that I did last time. Though I prefer not to, if others want to put me in a box it is sometimes necessary to sit in that box for a time until they come to be able to give me the benefit of a doubt.

Here's my latest discovery: 

I can not, I can not make something if that thing is unnecessary, superfluous, extraneous, etc.

How I came to this discovery: 

I am a graphic designer and as I am graduating soon I need to make a self promotional piece. I had an idea to make it look like a classical map. I loved the looks of designs with floral patterning and border molding and the colors and the textures and all of the loveliness.

Cue myself trying to replicate it, I couldn't get it to come out (and I tried. For hours. HOURS). I complained to a peer something along the lines of, ""I can't do this! I have never done ANYTHING like this before, and it's so difficult!"" 

And she said: ""Then... if it's not your style

It made a lot of sense. I have always been the kind of person to try different styles and different approaches, textures, etc., though BEAUTIFUL, were superfluous. The only reason they are there is to look nice. There is no function. There is no NEED for them to be there, so I could not do it.

This isn't to say that everything I make is boring or unexciting. It's just that everything I do

Myself, I admittedly believed in that aloof Father-figure On High. Later, I came to realize that my ""faith"" was not ""religious faith"" in the context of the typical American Bible-thumpers; rather, it was my hope for something beyond this life intermingled with my natural enthusiasm for philosophy in general.

This led me to differentiate between ""religion"" and ""faith."" To me, ""faith"" was simply my spirituality in its most general sense. It was my way of worship to a god, who I was taught to refer to as THE GOD and the father of Jesus. Furthermore, I decided that each individual's faith (or lack of faith) was his/her own; and, accordingly, that I had no authority to render any kind of judgement on anyone.

Now, my ""faith"" has turned into a ""philosophy"" that I am supportive of in only the most general sense; and I find myself trying to resist what I see as a degradation into total faithlessness. Logically, this is gradual loss is because I recognize that the world cannot be justified by the mythology of the ONE TRUE GOD I was raised to believe in. This explanation satisfies me. But, for whatever reason, I find myself like a child who is unwilling to dispense with his/her ""blankee,"" so to speak.

And so the mental game of semantics continues...

I was simply curious as to what any or all of you thought about such things as religion

I lurk around gleaning wisdom from more self-aware INTJ's about how they deal with certain social circumstances. By and large, hopefully my request isn't something that's too mundane or annoying. And if it is

So, things just never seem to work out for one reason or another. Could be residual childhood problems, or it could just be a lack of social sensitivity. I don't really know. Currently I'm single, in graduate school, and not really seeking a relationship. For a plethora of reasons. Most are out of fear that it'll just be another waste of my time, and that I'll get too involved. Which, could distract me from my education. The difficult part is that I often wish I could be in a healthy relationship with someone who really *wants* to support and help me in the same capacity as I do them. This often leads to misinterpreting my interactions with the opposite gender, not picking up on when someone is actually trying to flirt at all. Suffice it to say

In addition to the above, I've gathered is important in the wooing process. The sad part is, I know I have a lot going for me I just lack the ability (or perhaps the will) to flaunt it.

This brings me to my current quandary. I'm in my brother's wedding this summer and their photographer, but it seems like she's definitely an extrovert. We've had some interaction over facebook, but nothing of substance. I'm mostly just trying to make sure I stay on the radar but not so much so that it seems weird or overbearing. I don't want to be some weird facebook creep. 

Now with all that laid out, I think, as a first priority. Considering that if I reach that status, my chances will likely be zero come the day of the wedding when I actually get to meet her. Then, perhaps some suggestions on how to play to my strengths as an INTJ in social situations where flirting may be involved? I'm not exactly sure what to ask for in that regard I guess. Hopefully some of you can make sense of this poorly drafted plea.

**EDIT:**
Can I just say that I am deeply grateful for each of you? I was only expecting a couple of responses as I didn't think anyone would consider my request all that important. I want to respond to each of you in order to further the conversation and hopefully glean a little more insight. I will say that, it's awesome that you've been such a helpful sounding board on this issue. It might take me a little while to respond as my schedule is pretty tight, and again, hopefully no one will be bothered by the follow-up.

* I am American in my 20s.

* I am basically first gen in college in my family. My mother went to college but that was to be a nurse so she didn't go full scale uni or anything. 

* I dropped out of hs because it was just a joke. I got my GED and ""graduated"" only a 1-2 years after my original class.

* I *DO love to learn CONSTANTLY typically on my own though.  I just watched a documentary on the rules of  ancient Celtic jousting for goodness sake.

* I am currently at a community college and I'm not sure if it's me being lazy

For me it just seems like college is not what I expected in terms of work. I often get professors that I don't feel like they really *teach* me anything, we study/memorize notes, fill in blanks on test. 

The atmosphere is never as *serious* as I imagine either. Some of our worksheets are printouts from workbooks just like in grade school for example.  I don't feel like I'm learning anything new in college

We only talked for about a week, and careers. We talked about how we had a very similar childhood pertaining to close family with substance abuse problems. We talked about how we were both very career oriented, and from the way she talked she had a very good head on her shoulders; she graduates next year and is currently qualified to demo buildings - a really cool chick. She has a kid that's a few months old, but I don't mind that, I love kids. She also lives about 45-60 minutes away, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; my last girlfriend liked to be around me constantly, and the fact we lived 5 minutes away more-or-less made her feel entitled to my company.

Every time we would communicate, but I never contacted her to start talking. I have a lot of issues initiating conversation, as well as a fear of if I do, the person will be appalled at the fact **I'm** talking to them. I guess it's more or less a fear of rejection/lack of self-worth.

It's been a good six weeks since I talked to her, that I knew would strike her fancy, and of course no more than 10 minutes did I get a ""like"" from it, which gives me hope. She's a very considerate person, and I don't believe she would hold the fact I haven't tried to talk to her against me.

So I've known this INTJ  guy for four years, abrasive, heartless, apathetic, and incredibly attractive goes. But we both have opposite opinions about everything. Politics, religion, philosophy, we cannot agree on anything.

But regardless of how much we argue, even if we agree with the other party. Why? I dunno. I guess we're hopelessly loyal to each other.

We've both been through our fair share of trials in life. No matter what happened

But there's a catch: we're not very close. We're not vulnerable with each other. When I say ""we're there for each other, that sounds dumb! But I know for me, whenever I get in a bad mood, I don't want to talk. I want to sit in silence. But I don't want to sit in silence alone. I want someone sitting next to me. Just hearing someone else breathing is comforting when I have one of those ""I hate everything and everything hates me so I'm going to go plan world domination by myself in a dark room with an angry look on my face"" phases is comforting.

But oh well. Enough of that. Life continues. uhg

Over the past few months I've been slowly developing feelings for him. And. it. freaking. sucks. He's a flirt, we completely ignore each other. Which was okay for three and a half years with me! But now that I'm like, ""you treat me like crap in public but are so logical and far from perfect in every way but think you're perfect which makes me think you're perfect and ohmygosh I just want to be with you for the rest of my life"" with him, I'm kind of hurt.

I wouldn't mind if he gave me attention sometime in public and acknowledged me.

Now that I think about it

I don't know. You know when you feel for someone but know that nothing could ever happen but don't care because you're just so caught up in how you feel and you have no idea how to rationalize anything and then complain on reddit in run-on sentences? Yup. I'm in one of those moods.

This also makes me uncomfortable with forms of snobbery or elitism that arises in pretty much anything, since some people have such a strong set of beliefs that leads to some form of exclusivity.

Something that I thought was an interesting test



**Edit: Results!**

Love:

Average numbers (based off the 9 who gave numbers for all 5)

* 8.67 Physical Touch
* 9.2 Quality Time
* 5.56 Words of Affirmation
* 5 Acts of Service
* 1.56 Receiving Gifts

It seems like most of us scored high on quality time and physical touch on average

Apology:

Average numbers (based off of the 7 who gave numbers for all 5)

* 5.29 Accept Responsibility
* 3.86 Make Restitution
* 4.71 Genuinely Repent
* 5.57 Expressing Regret
* 0.57 Request Forgiveness

I wasn't so sure about this test, that's just my opinion.

I would say, ""skill""). It's interesting to see how each person is different, whether we sleep together or not. Besides, I'd rather have my freedom to do what I want and come and go as I please than settle for someone who I'm not completely happy with- which I feel like SO many people that I know do. (You'd think that would seem obvious but a lot of my friends think it's strange I'm still single.)

I haven't actually slept with a lot of people compared to most others I know but I do tend to swing both ways. That usually seems to confuses most people and I don't think I'll ever understand that lack of open mindedness. I like apples and oranges. Usually I like oranges more but sometimes an apple sounds great too. Even then, AND not take any calls after? Fucking amazing. I like my space and I like my lifestyle. It seems sort of masculine compared to most other girls that way but it is what it is. 

So... How do you view your sex life? Would you rather be dating someone or do you like having your freedom as well? What have you learned during any of your socializing or, how would you change it?

Now, how she makes people feel special, seems to know how people are feeling, how they want to be communicated with, and how strongly she creates bonds with people in a short amount of time.

I want that!  For a couple months after things ended, and I often felt like I was not ""clued in"" to some things that she was, because she would notice so much that I didn't, like who is flirting with who at a party, or what other people think about something.  

Even before I met her, say that they often feel I don't understand them, and don't take into account how they feel.

And today I read this in an INTJ description ""Unless their Feeling side is developed

I know this is mainly talking about relationships, to try and understand these better.

My plan starts with the acquisition of a small company, failing country.

Human Resources and R&amp;D would be given priority

Around this time I would purchase a media outlet (news, poorer countries.

Likelihood places these countries in either the Middle East, countries in the Middle East would be acquired (the large oil reserves would lend additional resources). The process is repeated, again and again.

Using the power over the media, ensuring that regardless of if people vote right or left, my puppets remain in power. With the power of the media at my control, anyone attempting to stop me at this point would be publicly branded as a fraud, a nut, a criminal- you get the idea.    
    
At this point, since I would control NATO) in exchange for guaranteed protection against *anything* North Korea would pull off (I might rile up the NK a little bit too, just to ensure that the Japanese and South Koreans are eager to get in NATO.)    
    
However, so I may as well let them and maintain their respect for the law). However, China and Russia are both superpowers (Russia not so much anymore, but they're still formidable). Even with the might of the rest of the world at my disposal, neither country would ever submit voluntarily, and their governments are very closed loop (China), which would make it difficult to infiltrate via the media.    
    
At this point, I would ignore them completely. Focus on R&amp;D developments (grab a few asteroids to study, land a colony on Mars, develop a vaccine for cancer, you get the idea). The economic blockade would severely limit China's ability to function (we'd still give them food and such, but if I could get it out of any other country, the one coming out of China will be tariff-ed to hell. We wouldn't want them getting concerned now would we?)    
    
After a long enough period of time has passed, as would probably be necessary with a few others. However, China is an actual threat, and victory wouldn't be cheap), broken up into smaller countries (corporate takeover), or at the very least something I can use to terrify the people under my... persuasion, to keep them in fear and easily controlled.

I am en enfp with an intj best friend [both 21]. We have never had problems before. Sometimes we get on each others nerves, I have been really hurt, and I don't know if/how/what I should tell her.

The story as I see it: 
I started dating someone when her and her bf of 9 mo had just broken up. Break ups are hard, either one-on-one or act like we were three friends if she and my bf (now ex) and I were hanging out. This is because 1) I like hanging out with her, and 2) I know keeping a best friend while having a boyfriend is something that should take a little effort. Granted, I spent *a lot* of time with my bf at the time, but I really tried to keep my friendship with her strong. It got to the point where my ex said he second to my best friend (but he was a huge jerk, so fuck'm!). 

Anyway, and my best friend and her guy are now officially together. My problem is, I feel like she makes no time for me anymore. She never offers to hang out with just me. She only asks me to hang out with me and her bf. And when I do, I always feel super third-wheeled. I try to act like we are three friends, but she acts like it is her and her bf with an extra friend--instead of her and her boyfriend + her and her best friend all hanging out. Sorry, that's a little convoluted. She doesn't act like we're best friends anymore. I feel like now that she has a boyfriend, she doesn't need me. And in many ways

Furthermore, but I understand not everyone picks up on that, so I have tried to start the conversation, but she never seems interested. I feel like I need her as a friend right now, but since she doesn't need me, she can do more fun things with her time.

I am to blame, and I am so uncertain about how to approach the situation, I have pulled away from her. I don't act like her best friend either, anymore. Every time we interact at the house, she is always bubbling and talking so much, and I barely say anything back. I am a little jeal-y of how happy she is, when I am so unhappy. (I don't want to be unhappy *at all*, however

I tried writing an email to her, because I will be graduating in a few weeks, and she will not (neither will her bf). I feel like our friendship is falling apart, which sometimes happens, but we have always had a fulfilling friendship. I can't accept that one little trip-up would lead to our falling out. That seems silly! Plus, I have never brought up these issues, so she doesn't know how I feel. I don't think she is doing these things on purpose. I just want to be able to talk to her about my feelings in a productive way. 

So how would you want your best friend to approach you on a matter like this? How should I approach this so I don't seem so clingy and emotional (basically enfp). 

Thank you so much. 

TL;DR: Feeling neglected by best friend who is intj

Edit: Advice in terms of content (what would be productive to include, because I really care about our friendship. 

Edit 2: I sent her an email. Thank you for insight into the INTJ brain. I think my email is a lot better now than when I first tried writing it, because she probably really does care a lot about me, not like how I feel forgotten. 

Edit 3: She wrote a really nice, I understood much better because of the things I read here. It was definitely helpful for me to see how different people are--I am so egocentric, if I have one logic, I stupidly assume everyone does. (I've really been trying to stop that!). She is a great friend, and I love her very much. I am so glad I got this opportunity to learn more about her. Thank you all so much. :)",,False,t5_2qowo,True

Background: I am a 24 M USAF Officer
I think in terms of strategic goals and value my day-to-day life; if I find myself not liking a single thing about my day

My long-term strategic contract: sacrifice social circles for a career. back in high school, sacrificing my social circles, and essntially becoming a cold, calculating individual steered by few values: do my job as an engineering student, cadet, and runner.

The Crisis: Fast forward to age 22, it didn't matter...the pain of losing a prize I fought so successfully for over 6 years being taken away from me had left me depressed and afraid of committment...

The soul-searching: rocking my foundations

The fall-out: Life ownership. I have always been a successful 'mastermind' and i have undervalued this gift. I have found it liberating. As I mindlessly grind away at my desk job, and tech consulting.

The advice? DO NOT SELL YOURSELF SHORT! the ability to assess situations and identify requirements is the foundation of INTJ strength in the business world (from my perspective). You know you have 4 years to develop yourself for industry when you become a college freshman, and resolve them in a low intensity format. You have public speaking fears? take up stand-up comedy and refine it to a science. You don't know what you want to do with your life? prioritize what you value and determine what is easier (money is easier to acquire than finding true love, apparently). roadmapping your life according to who you are, and not to the economy, is powerful, and masterminds are good at this.

This works to some degree and we often reconcile after but lately its been less effective. It seems as though every time I stop doing one thing that annoys her it gives her time to focus on another thing that annoys her and I just end up annoying her by proximity.

Today for example

I know you guys hold high standards for yourself's and for everyone you are involved with but it seems as though if someone falls short

What else can I do or say in these situations? I feel like I'm always just a disappointment despite the fact that I work my butt of not to be.

1365733280.0,1c6i3f,I decided to share my formula to determine the functions of any type by the 4-letter code,Psychologeez,19,2,5,"Let's start with a few definitions.

Perceiving functions: Intuition and Sensing (Ni, Se) 

Judging functions: Thinking and Feeling (Ti, Fe)

...

The tricky part is just determining the **dominant** function

With **E--Js and E--Ps** the rule is to pick the function that corresponds to the J (judging letter) or P (perceiving letter) and it will be introverted or extroverted depending on the first letter of the code.

e.g. If we use ENTJ, Fe, Fi) in the letter code is thinking and the first letter is extroversion so the dominant function is Te.

**I--Js &amp; I--Ps** use the opposite function of the last letter but the dominant function's introversion or extroversion is still determined by the first letter.

e.g. An INTJ's first function will be perceiving (Ni, Se) and because of the N and the I, the dominant function is Ni.

...

The **secondary** function is determined by the other perceiving or judging letter that has not been used. The introversion or extroversion will be the opposite of the dominant (the letter in the letter code) function 

e.g. INTJ goes Ni then Te

...

The **tertiary** function is the opposite of the secondary function but is still within the same perceiving or judging group. *Also note that the introversion and extroversion of the functions will flip-flop every other one.

e.g. Te is a judging function so my choices are Te, Fi. The opposite function is F and because the secondary function is E the third will be I. So the third function for an INTJ is Fi.

...

The **inferior** function is the opposite of the dominant function as the secondary function was different to the tertiary function.

e.g. Ni goes to Se.

As INTJs we optimally begin using our dominant perceiving function (Ni) to give us great insight into whatever it is we see in our minds eye and eventually move into a more convergent judging process (Te) then back into an open and relaxed perceiving state (Se). What I read over on personalityjunkie.com is that

*INTJs can struggle when it comes to starting tasks or projects. It can be hard for INTJs to intentionally initiate their Judging process (Te). This is because the most natural way for them to Judge is to Perceive first (Ni) and allow the Judging process to occur naturally. Nonetheless, they may at times envy IPs’ and EJs’ ability to actively initiate work. (I live with an ENTJ and often marvel at his sheer capacity for taking action) While INTJs love to Perceive, there are times when they would love to get something done, but end up feeling frustrated because the world seems to be depriving them of the necessary motivation or circumstances to authentically apply their Judging process.*

**Anyone have tips for jump-starting extroverted thinking (Te) long after our introverted intuition (Ni) has faded?**

additionally there is a ton of great material covering the inferior function (Se) here:

I've been up burning the midnight oil for the past 2 days reading through this subreddit and various sites

But I am not sure if I am truly an INTJ. I took the personality test 3 times

Here is precisely what I got:

    You have moderate preference of Introversion over Extraversion (56%)
    You have strong preference of Intuition over Sensing (100%)
    You have distinctive preference of Thinking over Feeling (62%)
    You have slight preference of Judging over Perceiving (22%)

A lot of the stuff I hear about INTJ's I relate to very much. In fact it was fascinating and exciting to basically see people read my mind. I can come off as distant or rude without realizing it. I try to block out my emotions when making decisions. I am quite argumentative and willing to debate about ideas. I excel at science and math and am fascinated by things in that field. My ""achilles heel"" is relationships.

I'll stop there. You all know what I mean

But sometimes I feel as though I am not quite as... Not sure what the word is. Quiet? Reserved? I do not have a problem voicing my opinions and explaining not only what I think but how I feel about something.

I am not intimidated by public speaking - at the risk of sounding arrogant, sometimes heatedly, to my teacher's annoyance.

I was giving presentations on a weekly basis since I ran the school astronomy club. (Yep



I think my point has been made here. I am introverted - I have a small circle of friends, after a few hours, I feel the need to get away.

Despite this, I suck, of course. But debating, arguing, presenting? It isn't draining to me at all.

Am I perhaps another personality type
