1363526401.0,1agnnd,Had to actually use my pocket sand on someone. ,,1806,134,45,"It was 8 PM. I was walking through a small forest in the middle of town since it was a shortcut from the track I was practicing at. A large man in a dark jacket and black beanie came up to me and asked for directions. Without hesitating

He then opens his jacket and shows me his pocketknife. ""You know the drill"" he said

As I'm reaching for my wallet,* and there was a load of sand in my pockets from the pit we jump into. Also, I always reload there. 

""Yeah just a second...""

As I pretend to take out my wallet

I get to the airport, may I see your boarding pass?""  I reach in my back pocket and grab it, kinda throw it at him...  And it's full of sand.  I pocket-sanded the TSA.  I didn't know how to react.

1364199672.0,1aypkq,Pocketsand: A Personal Journey of Enlightenment,belfegore,304,36,26,"I see many posts in this subreddit discussing types of sand, but very few, I'd like to talk about the philosophy behind pocketsand and my personal journey toward pocketsand enlightenment.

My story begins back in my teen years (I'm middle-aged now). I was an unruly, while being obnoxious in public, I was set upon by an angry group of ruffians whose ancestry and personal hygeine I had questioned. Granted, I probably did deserve a beatdown for what had come out of my mouth, but it was five against one, me being the one. I tried to extricate myself from the situation, but I was quickly grabbed from behind by one person while the other four lined up to use me as a punching bag. Suddenly, my assailants started dropping to their knees, slight of build and calm of demeanor. He looked past me, and suddenly his hand flashed into his pocket. The next thing I knew sand was flying past my head straight into the eyes of the man holding me without a single grain touching me. My attacker dropped

After a few minutes of cutting thru alleys and side-streets, but he spoke first. ""You are unruly and undisciplined. I should have let those people pummel you, as you deserved a beating for your words. However, I see within you potential. Your spirit is strong and alive. You show no fear. With proper training, you could become a master."" I was confused, so I asked him a master of what. He smiled, reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of sand. He let some of it flow thru his fingrs into his other hand. Then with movement too quick to be picked up by the human eye, the other square in my mouth. I dropped down, and I looked up at the man who had just saved me, and uttered the word that would change my life forever

I became his disciple that moment, referring to him only as ""master"". He had me move into his house so I could become completely immersed in the ways of pocketsand. At first though, I was given no pockets or sand. I wore a pocketless robe, and he kept all sand far away from me. The only sand I ever saw was in the hourglass he gave me. He would have me meditate in front of the hourglass. I would watch the sand flow thru the narrow neck, draining from top to bottom. He told me to focus on the grains, observe how they fell, how, no two grains were alike. I did this twice a day, after several weeks and several pocketsandings he administered to me when I would become disrespectful, he stood behind me during my nightly meditation. As the last grain of sand fell thru the neck

When I awoke the next morning, I followed him thru a set of doors I had never been thru. They opened into a zen garden; a sea of sand with islands of rocks and shrubs scattered throughout. I stood, mouth agape, taking in the peaceful spledor of it all. He handed me a wooden rake saying, ""While you have earned your pockets, you have not yet earned the sand to put in them. You know what to do, now concentrate as you do it."" 

For the next two months, surreptiously slipping it into my pocket, but I knew that was wrong. I also knew I would receive a face full of sand for such a transgression. While my master was quiet and kind, I knew he would tolerate no breaches of discipline and would punish me harshly and sandily. At night, over dinner, he would leture me about sand, invoking memories of his training during his youth. He was Egyptian and had learned the pocketsand ways of the pharaohs. He had studied in the shadows of the great pyramids. He explained how the sphinx, had been used as a target for pocketsanders (""You think Mother Nature wore down the stones of the sphinx? Bah! More like thousands of men hurling the grains of the earth at it for thousands of years.""). Over the months, the hurlers of Hawaii, components. He spoke of the elements

As the months rolled by and he began to trust my instincts, when he did not hand me the rake, but rather told be to bend down and grab a handful of sand and put it in my pocket. ""Not only do you understand the sand, but the sand understand you."" This was when my training began in earnest. 

The next few years are a bit of a blur. We studied basic techniques for about six months at his house. It took me a while before he told me I no longer threw sand like a spastic, and the ""hand of sand"". Once I had learned the basics, we began to travel the globe to further my instruction. I learned Bedouin style from the nomads of the Sahara, and Dervish style from the teachers of Timbuktu. I learned from the Navajo, the Greeks, and the aborigines of Australia. I received training from ex-military from the U.S. and Russia, as well as secrets from the CIA and KGB. I became fully immersed in the ways of pocketsand. I swear there were times I could feel the grains flowing thru my blood. 

Finally, ""I have given you all the knowledge I know, as well as introducing you to other masters. You have learned your lessons well. Now it is time for your final test. Walk thru the desert. You know the direction. Meditate then begin your trek in one hour. I shall be waiting for you on the other side."" And so I did. The walk was long, arduous, hot, full of mirages. I used pocketsand to fend of snakes, vultures, and even a group of survivalists. Then, and I could barely breathe. I struggled to walk, thinking I had lost it all

My master was waiting for me, then laugh. I stood before him and he looked me over with pride in his eyes. ""I taught you well, but, more importantly, you learned well. I was right to have chosen you."" I bowed before him and thanked him for his teachings and wisdom. He smiled more, then reached into his pocket and pulled out a pouch. ""Here,"" he said, but to be passed on to the one you train. It has been passed down for hundreds of generations, kissed me on my cheeks, like time

That was many years ago. Though I live a normal life, like me, awaits the arrival of a student who is worthy of the lineage it represents. Someday, I'm sure, I will find a pupil who is worthy to teach, though I must continue my sandy journey to make sure I am worthy to teach. Until then, I will continue to live, and pocketsand. Thank you for reading my humble story. May you be one with the pocket,self,

Anyway

I used to think this whole pocket sand thing was just a joke, sand in my pocket? What if I accidentally put my phone in there or something?  What would all the girls I sleep with think if sand started falling onto their bed sheets?

Well, in his car, just waiting for an unsuspecting victim and his time to strike.  My pocket change must have alerted him to my presence.  My heart started beating faster and faster, my pupils shrank, and everything seemed to go in slow motion.

He said ""Excuse me

I instantly froze with fear, I reached into my pocket, and accidentally pulled it inside-out upon retraction of my hand.  A handful of change fell to the asphalt around my feet, and the noise it created echoed throughout the entire parking lot.

I looked up, the lone penny from my pocket rolling into the gutter, and suddenly the parking lot seemed to be teaming with life.  How long had I been with the stranger? I did not know, but all attention from the recent parking lot denizens was now upon me.  This was the most frightening moment of my life.

I finally willed myself to move, until I finally found it.  In agonizing pain, I fumbled for my keys and started the engine.  One of them was there, knocking on my window, asking me if I was alright.  

Oh God why?  In my haste, but I think I caused serious harm to my transmission.  Now I have medical bills, car repair bills, and am left with a traumatic experience that will scar me for life.  ...Not to mention I ruined my favorite pair of pants due to a certain detail from the incident that I choose not to share.

I can't help but think all of this could have been avoided had I just filled my pocket with sand.  The sand would have prevented the change from rattling, engine, dignity, pants, AND change intact.

I only have one word of caution, make sure you have a backup pocket filled with sand (and sand only) if you feel you need that extra layer of security.  I recommend wearing either some type of pocketed coat, or (if it's warm out) a pair of these: http://i.imgur.com/VSu8viJ.jpg Just note that said pants may also increase the likelihood that a perpetrator may anticipate that one (or more) of your pockets my be filled with sand, giving him the foresight to approach wearing safety goggles.

After much debate we mods have decided that the most beneficial way to use this Reddit Gold is to give it to the Redditor with the best demonstrative pocket sand original content. This could include a video showing proper pocket sand throwing technique, an info graph showing the benefits of different pocket defense material, or any informative thing your brilliant minds can think of.

To submit an entry simply press either of the two links directly below the search bar on the right side of the page. The most upvoted post will be declared the winner and granted a month of Reddit Gold and their work will be featured on our sidebar to teach future pocket sanders. If we mods find any other submissions worthy of going in the sidebar the submitter may receive an as yet undetermined consolation prize in return for allowing us to use their link.

Pocket sand has been speculated to have begun amongst early man.  Obviously early man had no pockets but instead evidence suggests that men wove reeds into baskets that hung on loin clothes. These ""loin baskets"" are believed to initially contain not sand

With the encroaching ice age, our ancestors had little food to fill their pants baskets, so to satiate their appetites they often ground sand into a paste with snow.  In the ice, sand was a hard commodity to come by, so early mans basket was often filled with sand.  

From the Dauterive cave painting

In a defensive strategy used by weaker tribes a basket was concealed under another pelt. This gave them an advantage in that attackers could not tell if they carried sand or not.  The resulting stability in tribal politics created a never before seen peace among the tribes and humanity flourished.

I compiled these stories from various sources who I shall not name to protect then from our big government attempting to control our rights to carry particulate defensive materials.  Anyone who would like to add to this history should do so at their own risk.",self,t5_2unq9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pocketsand/comments/1g71c1/a_brief_history_of_pocket_sand_for_those_new_to/

Let me enlighten you

(Some tips)
If you do not use pocket sand humbly

The SHASHASHA comes from the way it sounds in your pocket when you run

It is highly reccomended to not use all of your sand in one throw so that if you miss

It is mandatory as of 2010 that you listen to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTAXUYLbFYk video at least 15 minutes a day

Anyone who is a master of the sand must be reffered to as a ""Sandman"", ""Sandmen"".

Becoming a Sandman is not easy

It all started around 1270 A.D. in Asia. There was a small city-state that was barely heard of near Mongolia called ""Pocknsad""

1270 - 1390
There were a few people who carried around sand in their pockets because they filled their clay pots with them to ensure it was hard for thieves to get away. One day some ruffians attacked. They didn't have anything to defend themselves, simple threw them in their eyes. They fell to the ground and screamed.
The group of men who had the sand ran away and yelled to cause a distraction. They used this alot

1390 - 1680
It was then established as mandatory to yell Sh-Sha-Shaaa when having success pocketsanding someone, and other used it simply to cruelly hurt people. Sand-seppuku was created.
People then discovered proof of a man made of sand who was wise: they called him ""The Sand Man"". Some say he was the first user of pocket sand, however, could not live as long as The Sandman himself and only taught 5 people each. There were now, as of the year 1664, 75 Sandmen alive. The next year, one of the originial 15 Sandmen died, lowering it to 74. At this point it was much required you spend lots of time focusing your life on pocket sand, if a Sandman

1680 - 1970
From then on they are used as such before; However
Richard Conway: US Agent
One day
That is only one of many accounts of pocket sand being involved in espionage.

1970 - Present
It is still used much the same way
for at least 15 minutes a day

There is only one known account of a Sandman on this website: belfegore. He was taught by a Sandman and is now one. I too
There are currently accounts of 276 living Sandmen. This religion has much died away. Good luck friends

May your pockets be filled with sand
