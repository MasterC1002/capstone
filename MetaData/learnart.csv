All of the below links were done on my iPad 3 through the app Procreate.  I use a stylus. :)

This is the first drawing I did.  It was for /r/sketchdaily 's daily theme.  The theme was ""Eastern"".  I'm not super proud of this one.  I wanted to try something I had never done in doodles or art class

My second drawing was again done for the daily sketch.  This theme was ""Pumpkin"".  I'm actually really proud of it.  The shading isn't stellar

This is a WIP.  I just sat down and started drawing

I've changed. I'm 25 now. 8 months ago

I decided to get back into drawing, but actually *doing* it seemed to be difficult for some mysterious reason.

All it took to get back into it was the first step. All I had to do was sit down and draw. I set up a still life in my room

15 minutes turned into a half-hour and then an hour. I'm feeling good about the direction I'm taking my work. Nobody expects me to do this

So my advice to you is to start small. 15 minutes sketching every day at first

I would like to first apologize for my absence for a few months. The reasons are this:

About a month ago, with no reply. This means that my attempts to make self-posts regarding the moderation issue have automatically been deleted, and any attempt I have made to appoint a new moderator have been met with a 500 error. I did not realize they were not showing up, and only recently just checked for that.

I will continue to email the admins in regards to this. I'll update you guys when I have more information.

I've always taken a very hands off approach to moderation

If you'd like to help me find out why my account is currently stuck in limbo

In addition

Cheers

Advice appreciated.,TheUKLibertarian,35,2,18,"So I've never put the effort into getting good at drawing but this year I thought I'd set myself a challenge. To create a drawing for every day of the year and post it to a dedicated blog. I'm probably going to commit to giving $5 to charity for every day I miss or something like that to give myself maximum leverage to follow through.

You can see the blog and my first ""benchmark"" post (my starting point) [here](http://everydayadrawing.com/2012/12/24/quentin-crisp-drawing/).

What I'd like advice on is what you guys think would be the most efficient way to go in order to improve quickly and consistently? Is there a particularly well respected book on learning to draw that I could work through? Is there a process of drawing then reviewing your mistakes that leads to improvement? 

For those who have leart without format tuition what advice would you give yourself if you were starting out again?

Currently I'm probably just going to copy portraits or other interesting things as best I can and then comment on the blog on what I think I did okay and what I did badly. From that I should have a framework for what I can work on the next day etc. Not sure though if this will be blind leading the blind so I thought I should ask here for feedback on my proposed process?

I'll probably post everything I do on Reddit too for critique so I can get feedback that way but I just want to maximise my chanceso f getting the most out of this fairly large commitment and I know you guys are going to have better advice in this area than me!

I'm sorry that this post is kind of meandering. Basically I'm not sure what advice I'm even looking for but I know that good artists will have very useful things to say so I'm all ears!

1346756813.0,zbwir,One Method To Refine Skill and Technique,MLP_Awareness,40,6,5,"[I use this method often](http://imgur.com/a/KykXh) when I do sketches I plan on scaling up.

I was taught this method in college from Joe Norman a fantastic and wise artist.

He was very adamant about hard work

The method begins as such:

* Think of the concept, idea, image, shape, or whatever it is that you want to explore.

* Draw 16 small drawings/paintings/renderings exploring every possible iteration of the thought you're exploring.

* Take the strongest 8 and draw them a little bigger increasing the size approximately 25-50%.

* Take from those the strongest 4 and again enlarge the medium you're working with.

* Take your best of these four and choose the one which best exemplifies the original idea. Increase to the desired size.

* If you are doing giant 4' x 6' drawings like I was asked to do, you must consider what goes in this empty area.


This method is supposed to allow you to teach yourself. When you step back from something or come back to it 


The first 16 drawings allow you to get all the common and unordinary thoughts about what your are trying to do out of the way. The first 8-10 drawings will usually be the common idea that 75-85% of the population will come up with among your peers. The last will be (hopefully) increasingly more unique. *And trust me those last few take time


Starting small is also crucial. It allows you to focus more on the general layout and subject of what overall it will look like


Weeding through the results while increasing size lets you think more about what ideas worked and what commonalties are crucial to the concept. This also lets you simultaneously insert more detail and lets you discover what will fill the voids.


I am not taking credit for this idea


The pictures I attached obvisously do not follow the method absolutely. **Take this to mean you can adjust change the format to any way that makes sense to you**. Originally we started with 3x4"" squares for ideas


I've also tried this with painting. It helps a lot and saves **TONS** of paint. I also for both drawing,acrylics,oil I use a heavy weight 18x24"" multimedium paper and cut it up into 16's and 4's then go to canvas.


Hope this helps someone!

2.  (If you work freelance) How long did it take you to reach 'professional' levels?

3.  What aspects of art are important to you?  

4.  What are the biggest mistakes that you see artists make during study (drawing something new)

5.  What do you feel are the biggest time wasters in studying/producing art?

6.  If you had 3 months to teach a beginner to draw/paint with an intention of building a strong portfolio for a chance to work in the industry (concept design for example)

So here's my list of tips for digital art newcomers. It may not be exhaustive or perfect

-----------------------------------------------------

* You don't need Photoshop.

* Seriously, so don't judge them by how many tasks you can do with them. Judge them by their quality and usefulness.

* Get a piece of paper. Now sit back and draw on it without leaning over it. Yes

* Speaking of tablets

* Neither an expensive tablet

* Also, not bequeathed from on high. Never accept ""You're lucky to be good at that."", it is **always** ""You're good at that, you must have worked hard."".

* Try not to rest your hand on the tablet very often. When you do

* Consider buying or making a stand to sit the tablet on. You may not need one

* Stretch often

* This bit is very hard, or being too busy learning the other guy's style to develop your own.

* *Do* obsess over your *own* work though. Don't do this too much

* It's okay to spend a month on one piece. It's also okay to only spend ten minutes on one. Spend as much time as you need. Try not to rush yourself while learning. That doesn't mean, and either call it ""finished"", or leave it on the back burner while you work on something else.

* Draw EVERYTHING. That means two things. 1) Draw every object, and idea you can. It's practice, bitch. 2) Draw in every style you can. Learning styles will only strengthen your skills. The more styles you know, the easier it is to create your own.

* That said, if you try to forcibly make your style one thing or the other, it hinders you in the long run. Not always, but often.

* Similar to how I said ""Draw EVERYTHINGBLARG!!!!""

* Get others involved. Social reinforcement is a great way to keep passionate about the subject you're studying. Having a friend to bounce ideas and critiques off of is just plain good.

* Get into class. Being self-taught earns you a golden badge of awesome

* Also

* Another reason to not sit in-front of a computer all day is medium. If you only try to work using a tablet, you cannot possibly hope to gain skill quickly or understand your craft deeply. Practice drawing on paper. Get good at that first, and only then you can translate those skills into Photoshop (or whatever program you use).

* And lastly

------------------------------------------------

Here are some programs you can use if you like.

* [MyPaint](http://mypaint.intilinux.com/) (The development version is much more advanced than the stable one.)

* [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/)

* [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/)",self,t5_2s6fc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/ksm2u/tips_for_digital_art_newbies/

The wiki can be editted by anyone and I encourage you to do so if you feel you can help improve it.  I am certainly not the best at formatting this thing.  Right now I've listed a few mediums and divided them up into categories.  I created individual pages for the categories

Ever done that before? It burned my skin. My face looks and feels like I got a sunburn. No blisters

I put a whole bunch of my expensive face lotion on it to try to make it feel better. It looks fucking awful. How am I going to explain myself when people see me tomorrow? Uuuhhg.

Don't make the same mistake I did! Think twice before putting paint on your skin! Perhaps do a test spot first, wash it off right away! Don't wait until you get the shot, if you're trying to take a picture. Just go fucking wash it off! It's not worth it!

This is NOT a tutorial on digital painting. I'm assuming those who are reading this know the basics of digital painting.

One of the most important parts of digital painting (but often overlooked) is knowing your basic Photoshop hotkeys. For gamers out there you know how important it is to know the hotkeys of your game and not click around. So here are some of the most used hotkeys for me (I'm on a MAC so please excuse any Windows related errors):

B - Brush

E - Eraser

By knowing just B and E

CTRL Z - Unlimited Undo - I don't like the default Redo/Undo so I changed it to perpetually undo. BE CAREFUL as you cannot redo it (IRC).

Z and X to control brush size is very convenient for me. Trust me you will use these a LOT.

1-9 to change opacity. If you press 4 it'll be 40%. If you want 100% just press 1-0.

Side buttons on Wacom pen to zoom in/out. This also gets used a LOT. The side buttons are very convenient for zooming.

You also have 5 buttons on your Wacom tablet. I suggest keybinding one of them to make a new layer.

Please feel free to chime in on your personal hotkeys,False,self,t5_2s6fc,False,,,t3_1iaw0n

Watercolor is intimidating at first, so you feel more comfortable with the medium! Also, while it's difficult to ""undo"" a mark, it's very easy and in most cases more desirable to layer over colors, which can hide mistakes(:

""Tea"" is very light and watery, but still fairly saturated (kind of like a orange or yellow marker). ""Melted ice cream"" has a lot of pigment mixed with the water, so when you paint with it it leaves a bold color that really can't be layered over (like a purple or blue marker).

Whenever I paint with water color, and the final product comes out looking very dark and without much contrast. Remember: you can always add color and value, but you can't take it away. After I find my whites, I paint a few layers of ""tea"". These can overlap (if the first layer is completely dry) and create a different effect than if they were mixed, sort of like how in some fabrics you can see 2 colors of thread at once, only it's 2 layers of color at once. Once all of my light tones are painted in with ""tea"", I begin putting some ""milk"" layers in. The gradual buildup of thickness results in a much richer painting. Don't skip to the ""melted ice cream"" until you finish these layers! Once you have completed the ""tea"" and ""milk"", from white to medium-dark tones

Once you go through all of the thicknesses (while leaving plenty of drying time between layers, and your saturation levels should go from super-pale to hella-bold. All of this should look smooth and effortless, if it looks choppy go back and make the change more gradual. You should be able to see parts of the painting that stopped at ""tea"" or ""milk"". Not everything has to be built up to ""melted ice cream""!

There are a few watercolor techniques that make it much more interesting and can make your process easier. The first is ""Wet on Wet"", which is probably the one your most familiar with: just taking watercolor and painting straight onto the paper. Easy! Then there is ""Dry on Dry"", which is taking a barely wetted paint (less water than ""melted ice cream"". Think just-wet-enough-to-get-on-the-brush.) and painting on to dry paper, creating an interesting scratchy brush-strokey texture. There are a few extra things you can to to your watercolor to make it even more textury and yummy! These include the ""Salt technique"", which is where you sprinkle salt onto a wet area (super wet. like a puddle. The same wet you use for ""wet on wet"") right after you paint it (preferably tea to milk), and let it dry. This creates a cool tie-dye or starry effect. The salt can be carefully scratched off. The next is the ""Alcohol Technique"", where you use an eye dropper to drop rubbing alcohol onto the same type of just-painted puddle (preferably tea to milk) and watch the magic happen! It creates a very cool dotted texture. Then comes the ""Plastic wrap Technique"", you could lay a thin layer of gauze on top of your milk-puddle and leave it there permanently

Don't forget about the magic of watercolor pencils, if you dip the pencil in water it becomes very soft and you can draw straight onto the painting, leaving super precise and crisp melted ice cream lines.
As brush strokes go, ruins your paper and causes it to get rough and ""pill"". Stay with smooth, flowy strokes. Be brave and don't second guess your strokes. If you need to paint a large area, try the wet on wet technique. and wait until the paper is completely dry before going back with more layers. This will also help your painting from becoming muddy.

If at the end your painting still doesn't satisfy you

EDIT: a sure fire way to stop your paper from buckling and wrinkling from the water color paint: stretch your paper. This is simple and just takes a little time. STEP ONE: soak the water color paper in water, pushing off the excess water so it's not dripping, but still soaked. Center it on the gator board an make sure there are no air bubbles trapped underneath. You do not actually stretch the paper. STEP 3: cut 4 strips of gummed brown tape, one for each edge of the paper (make each about 6 inches too long). Dip it in water, push off the excess water and lay it on the edge of the paper, overlapping the paper about an inch and a Half. Smooth and move onto the other strips. STEP 4: with the tape and paper still wet, take a stapler and staple around the edge about 3/4 of an Inch from the exposed paper. This will help hold down the tape and keep the paper from pulling. STEP 5: wait a few hours. When the paper and tape is dry, hard surface!

*practice seeing at a slow pace, sometimes only look at the line you're ""drawing"" until finished; alternate these, both are crucial). Practice variations of unique lines (not shapes) in all directions: staircases, zig zags, loops, geometric, angular, curved
Everything else, is absolutely pointless FOR A NOVICE, until you become decent (you never stop, so just do this daily and you'll be surprised at your progress and how many misconceptions you've been having).* 

Trace the line slowly, did your hand also skip with your eyes? No. Now you don't even know where you are anymore! And that's what this is all about. Learn to stop skipping and reading, and start seeing. Slow and fluidly, and always completely.

Find some way to generate a large variety of lines at no (financial) cost to you. You can't\ drawing the same kinds of lines repeatedly, it's not writing, it won't ever be).

Don't worry about any other materials for a while, shading, etc.) Just pencil/pen, eraser and paper. You don't even need a plastic grid like in drawing on the right side of the brain, until a little bit later. Practicing seeing is what you should be doing as a novice. It makes everything so clear. 

**Disclaimer: THIS IS NOT THE 100% ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IDEA, THIS IS JUST AN ENTRY POINT INTO DRAWING FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BEGIN BY DRAWING AND NOT PAINTING OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW MASTERPIECES WITH ONLY LINE BEFORE STARTING EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT DO PRACTICE SEEING AND COPYING LINE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR SKILLS IMPROVE TO DECENT BEGINNER, UNTIL YOU SEE PROGRESS AT ALL.**

1355883554.0,1533tl,How screwing up actually HELPS my art,timleak,19,2,9,"I’ve always been a drawer

 I'm always working on one or two (or seven) different things, I've got a sketchbook, one or two sketching pencils, kneaded eraser and occasionally some charcoal pencils or oil pastels stashed in my backpack at all times.

And I’m learning more than ever.

First off, mostly trial and error. Attempting something new and failing repeatedly is the way I learn. I’m talking techniques here, little tricks you use while you’re drawing or painting, not elements of design or perspective, those help you before you lay a pencil to the paper.

Being told what to do doesn’t help me very much. It may be a psychological thing, and start using that trick over and over again, but that doesn’t happen if someone tells me about it. On the other hand, if I’m told about it, I may be intrigued but I’m not likely to use it any time soon. I waste time sometimes trying out one idea or another, but it's worth it because that feeling when you learn something new is just. . .

It’s a proud feeling, so instead you do it over and over again because there’s a feeling of ownership involved. This is YOUR technique; you discovered it all by yourself, other people might know it, but as far as you’re concerned, you invented it. 
 
That's why I keep a sketchbook. The experimenting isn't limited to any one specific time-frame; it's a constant daily activity. Any moment I have free, my reaction is to try drawing it, fail, try again with a different approach, maybe a different medium even, until I get it right.

 Reading about how to be better is all well and good, like hatching and crosshatching. They’re ‘shading techniques,’ right? Well yes, but knowing how they look when I draw them, I use them more often as a way of getting texture. Hatching leaves a shape with a smooth, shiny surface, assuming the lines are spaced right. Crosshatching and stippling on the other hand are rough, more controlled of the two.

 Until you've TRIED layering a ballpoint pen over highlighter or taking a toothpick to wet paint, but until you've done it and seen the results, you can't tell when it's best to use them.
	
I've got no problem with people telling me tricks for using media I'm new to, and they can help. To a point. But it's up to me to find how to do something well, and to be honest, I love testing myself, seeing it I’m right or wrong. And from what I’ve found, nothing ever is flat out, irredeemably ‘wrong’. Maybe it is for what I'm working on, I learn something; I learn to NOT do that when I want a certain effect

I can’t know, but I know how it looks when I do it, and that helps me to find a place for it. Figuring stuff out on my own has given me more confidence in my ability to design new pictures, to organize each element so it works as well as it possibly could in the finished work, complementing its surroundings as well as possible. 

What about you? There's a lot of artists here that are better than me,False,self,t5_2s6fc,False,,,t3_1533tl

1) I bought a good camera that takes external mic input. High Quality Vids! Yay!
2) I'm learning Drupal. It makes a lot of sense for the features I want to offer everyone.

Here's the plan for Stage 1 of the site (timeline-a couple months):
Free 100-level lessons on a variety of subjects hosted on the Youtube Channel.
Basic User Account with the ability to post on forums to get peer feedback and instructor feedback.
Where applicable
There will be a Blog with useful info.
Digital Downloads of Vids and associated printable DRM-free eBooks.
There will also be ads

Stage 2 (timeline-6-12 months):
Subscription (don't worry it's cheap) with access to 200-level and above classes if you want to learn a variety of things.
AND/OR Digital Downloads (paid) for 200-level and above classes so you don't have to subscribe if you know exactly what you want to learn. If you subscribe
Lesson submission system so any approved teacher can contribute to the school.
And loads more stuff.

I'm excited about this. I can't wait to give all this info back to the world and hopefully provide a cheap alternative to art schools. I'm also flattered and surprised at how many people have watched the youtube vids I've put up

How you hold your pencil and position your sketchbook.

Now, it never even crossed my mind. I had always sketched with my sketchbook flat on a tble in front of me and held my pencil as I always had in the scribe or ""writing"" grip.

Only recently have I realized there are other methods (which i had glimpsed before but mainly thought were just for specific tasks like shading and such) and trying to delve and get used to this new way of drawing. 

So I'm trying to use the loose grip more

Are there any tips for drawing in this type of grip or other useful grips? I've found I can easily draw very big pictures but the very light and thick nature of the lines this grip makes makes it very hard to sketch smaller pictures and also I sometimes have trouble getting my line in the right place as it's a little more ambigious when drawing with the side of the lead instead of the tip.

**EDIT** : Typed on my phone and it shows:\ It's supposed to say

**EDIT2**: I found the warmup that I had previously stumbled upon! It sounds great so I'll share it. (This is in a comment on another site
&gt;
&gt;""
&gt;The drills are as follows -
&gt;
&gt;Place 8-10 points in a line on side of a page, or the line gets wavy, nix it and add a new pair of points to make up for the failed line until you have about 8 good straight lines.
&gt;
&gt;Next
&gt;
&gt;The next drill is to draw a straight line, identical actions when necessary. You don't want the thick line to get split ends, eventually it should look like you took a thick marker and drew a line.
&gt;
&gt;The next drill is the same as the previous
&gt;
&gt;That's followed by parallel arcs - same as the parallel lines
&gt;
&gt;I think draw two lines that have about a thumb width between them, repeatable shapes.
&gt;
&gt;I draw another set of lines, so it looks like a row of venn diagrams. The goal is to be able to do that without distorting the circle.
&gt;
&gt;From there, the goal is to be able to draw repeatable, consistent shapes, this time with the added difficulty of different sizes. Larger circles are a lot harder to tame.
&gt;
&gt;Then I practice ellipses, then try to draw the ellipse around that.
&gt;
&gt;From there, and organic shapes, with the goal of making them appear three-dimensional without shading, just perspective and line.""

This is my first post!

I have been wanting to draw for a while now but after getting all my stuff out and looking at the white piece of paper and trying to think about what to draw I would give up and not draw anything.

I've been reading Reddit for a week now and this subreddit for a couple of days and [everydayadrawing](http://www.reddit.com/user/everydayadrawing) inspired me to do the same. I need to force myself to draw to get better.

Anyway

I'm happy with the general result since it's my first one but I think I could have chosen a less ambitious project for my first drawing. My main difficulty was to get the right angles or perspective with all the curves of the ukulele (sorry if the terms are not very precise

Another difficulty pas contrast. strings and frets are pale and other parts, the hole being the darkest. Iv'e had difficulty having the strings look good.

Finally

I really want to know the process of getting from my hand drawn sketch to a final finished digital product

I also have some specific questions i would really appreciate if someone could help me with:

1) Resolutions/size/format
what size and resolution should I be working in if my work is intended for print? What's the difference between RGB and CMYK? What's the best file format to render my work in and is there anything else I should know?

2) Should I invest in a drawing tablet?

Basically, 2 years ago I just figured I'll start practicing. And now for 2 years I have practiced like hell and I'd like to go forward but I just don't know where. I have no idea what to practice anymore. I'd like to go more in depth into poses but I never know what poses to draw. I've had even few courses on drawing figures. Croques are easy, just too easy. Standing poses are easy, I want to go deeper. Go into drawing fantasy! Bad-ass characters, angels and devils. All sort of that stuff what makes you go ""COOOL!"".

But... I have no idea what to draw. It's not even about the blank canvas... I can draw a pelvis with legs and twisted legs... but when it comes to drawing an interesting, but it becomes too stiff.

And then I try to practice making the pose more fluid by drawing it over and over again

I sort of want to make fluid poses on the go

I've also tried inspiring myself and then just drawing. Eg. listening to music, browsing artsites, reading... but as much as I want to draw something, I'm never satisfied either with my idea or with my painful work. And yep, I know that brain is 5 years ahead of my skills. I'd just like to know what should be my general direction.

Things I want to learn: Building structures, fluid poses and compositioning.

Another option i was thinking of was presoaking the paper then taking it out and then applying a slight layer of oil to prevent it from drying it too much.  This way i can paint it an not worry about it drying and ruining the beauty of a nice clean flat uniform surface.

The idea makes sense but I figure I would ask you educated folk first.

First off: I'm a newbie. I started drawing in the first week of this year (it's my resolution to learn digital drawing until the end of this year :) ) and my first project is the drawing of a game screenshot. While I didn't have any problems with the proportions
I just can't make it to [the last step](http://www.ctrlpaint.com/sketching-lines/)

But besides that, especially clothing folds. My approach is to paint the whole area in the basic color and to darken/light up the places where there is a fold. But this just doesn't look right. Overall I don't get the coloration right. While it was easy to shade abstract forms, the same technique kind of looks out of place on clothes or skin. 
Or should I take a completely different approach and just draw the image in black and white and use layer -&gt; multiply and color it then? But I don't manage it to shade it in black/white neither.  

I'd highly appreciate some tips to help me with my problems :) I'm using PS CS5 and a Wacom Bamboo Pen - if this is relevant.

As well as any tips to get me on the right track, kneaded erasers and I have no idea where to start or what products offer a good quality for someone starting out.

So in my spare time (which isn't much) I've been painstakingly going through those books and practicing all the exercises laid out in them...

I feel like I am scared to do my own drawings until I've learned the basics from these books - but at the rate I'm going, I'll be finished going through them at this time next YEAR, maybe.
