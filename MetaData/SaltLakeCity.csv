Our goal is to provide people with an accurate reading of their blood alcohol content (B.A.C.) and if needed

From our mission statement

To do this, but they are sold to bar owners at high costs, not maintained, and aren't very accurate... Our kiosk is accurate to +/- 0.005%, every time.

The kiosk would cost $2 for patrons to use

We plan on putting these kiosks in bars at no cost to the venue owner

Any feedback would be awesome

**Here's where I would like your advice:**

* Where would you like to see BreathAdvisor kiosks placed? I'm thinking in bars and clubs that most people drive to. Where would you use one?

* Would you use a kiosk if you had been drinking and were considering driving home? (We need 4 uses per night if we're installing them for free.)

* Would you be willing to use the kiosk if it were free? I think $2 is cheap

* If you could throw us a ""Like"" on Facebook that would be pretty neat too

* If you know bar owners in Salt Lake that might be interested in this

*For our launch we'd love to do a bar crawl with fellow redditors, for example, getting higher alcohol content beers in our favorite bars. Lots of possibilities here if we do this right...*

**TL;DR We're trying to install breathalyzer kiosks in Salt Lake bars

**The first kiosk is being placed in Lumpy's South

**ANY FEEDBACK IS GREATLY APPRECIATED AND WE'D LOVE TO THROW YOU A PROMO CARD WITH FREE USES

I think we can do one better

I was in 4th grade and I actually don't remember anything specific in school education from before 7th grade, which was 4-5 people.  I was in the back as a ""systems engineer(I think)"" and it was my job to replace blown out ""chips"" on a ""circuit board"" to ensure the survival of the ship.  I remember having to work as a team and communicate with my commander about the ships status and repairs.  It was tons of fun and I've always wished to go back and experience one of the 12+ man simulators.  Heck I'd gather up all my friends right now and pay a good chunk of change to go play in that big simulator.  Anyways this simulator gave me a pretty big interest in electronics and I took the first electronics class that was offered to me in High school, me and my friend went on to get 3rd in state at an electronics competition hosted by Utah Valley University.  I can say this field trip had one of the biggest and longest lasting impacts on my education.

EDIT:  In case you're wondering why I didn't fight it - if found guilty (of the now $65 fine) ""a court imposed judgment filing fee of $60.00 will be added to the court case.  A judge may also impose attorney fees up to $75.00 and a collection fee of $45.00  A judgment will appear on your credit rating for 8 years"" (that brings the total to $245 for a fucking parking ticket!)

 and

 ""If your complaint is regarding a problem with the way the area is marked, or how you were treated by the officer, the courtroom is not the proper place for those types of complaints and will not be addressed by the judge.  The Hearing Officer or Violations Coordinate will be able to direct you to the proper person...""  

And that's when I got into an argument with the Hearing Officer who said ""that's the law - pay the fine"".",self,t5_2r7ac,1341611741.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/w58lg/fine_25_fucks_given_0_dicks_told_to_eat_1_bag/

""You're awful dressed up for Conference

""Something like that.""

Now, but I kept it together.  The train pulled up, and I climbed aboard.  I got off a few stops later, thinking I was in the right place, but I wasn't. I was one stop too soon.  So, there I am, walking down main street in the dark, going past the Wells Fargo building.  My tux shoes hurt

I notice, so I had a hunch what was going on.  

""WOOOOO!"" I yelled.

One of the girls turned and looked at me.  ""There's one, exposing their boobs, and shook them around.  ""Hope you enjoyed Conference!"" one of the yelled.

Would appreciate an explanation.,toinfinitiandbeyond,57,13,40,"EDIT3: The mystery has been solved!  My ex and her mother took their cars to be waxed at Super Sonic Car Wash.  We called Super Sonic in Orem and they confirmed that they do indeed put these little stickers on your license plate when you get your car waxed.  They also said that they've had no complaints about it.  I think they haven't had any complaints because people have no idea where these stickers came from.

I originally posted this in AskReddit but no one seems to have any idea what these stickers are for.

My ex-wife informed me about a strange thing that keeps happening to her and her family's cars. A strange little sticker keeps getting placed on their license plates. I've noticed other cars on the freeway with similar stickers as well.

She doesn't live in an apartment or park in any time limited lots.

Here's a photo of her mothers plate with a ""2"" sticker in between the numbers on her Utah License Plate.
Photo http://i.imgur.com/tefiI.jpg?1

I found another car in SLC that has similar stickers http://i.imgur.com/MwYtb.jpg

She claims she's contacted the DMV and they have no clue what the sticker is or where it could be from.

The little sticker gets placed in between the numbers on their plates.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could solve this mystery for her.

EDIT: One of my friends was at the DMV earlier today and they said that Super Sonic Car Wash might be putting them on but I can't imagine what the purpose of that would be.

EDIT2: The same friend that called the DMV called Super Sonic Car Wash and confirmed that they put a sticker like this on your plate when you have your car waxed.

Here is what he posted on Facebook:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Hey guys. i wanted to let you know i was assaulted last night and am now at the u of u hospital. I lost a lot of blood but im stable for now. The police are looking for the guy that did it so i am posting pictures online so people will help me find him.

The police are still actively looking for the guy who cheap shotted me with a glass. Apparently the bouncers at Maxwell helped him get away. I tried to find him but lost over 2 ltrs of blood in the process and have racked up thousands of dollars in medical bills so far. He had friends at the club who didn't say anything. He is white

Around 12:00 last night, he said yeah. As i assessed the situation he immediately slammed his cocktail glass into the side of my head.

The guy that did this was white

---------------------------------------------------------------
The suspect was in his mid-to-late twenties and around six feet tall. If anyone has information that could help police nab the guy

So having lived here for a while, why are Utah drivers dumb as bricks?

Allow me to explain. In other major population areas

**Traffic Control Devices** 

What I have noticed is that Red Lights typically don't matter. I have never seen so many people run red lights before. Sure people go on yellow

Heaven forbid the traffic light be completely off. People have no idea what to do (although that is sometimes typical everywhere). Or better yet when a light goes to flashing red and yellow. No clue how to proceed. See below.

**Stop Signs**

Why do people just drive straight through stop signs? I don't get that. Or even why don't people understand how they work. 4 way stops are a nightmare. People just go haphazardly. Where as the driving rules generally state, and go right through regardless of right of way.

**Speed Limits**

I notice speed limits are typically ignored. In the city, there is hardly any traffic.

**Ramp Meters**

Some are 1 car per green

**Head Lights**

Why do people not drive with their headlights on? I have never encountered this beast anywhere before, snowing, or even late at night. No headlights. What gives?

**Pulling Out In Front Of Vehicles**

This is the biggest pet peeve, am I going to total my car today?

I see this everywhere

What I find the most trouble with is, but when that clears and I can go straight, the car turning left just pulls out nearly every time, nearly t-boning me or me nearly t-boning them. What the heck?

**Blinkers**

Why does no one use blinkers?

**Summary**

So what causes this? Are Utah drivers

Case in point. Go to a RedBox, pay for it, then been so engrossed in their phone or person with them, they dont see the kiosk spit the movie out, then after a period, take the movie back in because it wasnt picked up. Then they get mad at the kiosk. While everyone in line clearly sees this happening.

The most prominent example that I see is with my line of work. I work for a federal land agency. I wear a uniform that clearly says in no less than three places what agency I work for. It is also the universal agency uniform nationwide. Then while in my agency's land they will ask me how I like working for another government land agency. Despite being both on my agency land and me in uniform. I know these people are not out of states because it happens so frequently

So guys

&lt;/rant&gt;

TL;DR: Why are utah drivers so terrible at driving?

And I realize this a downvote happy subreddit, comment and explain yourselves.

Edit: Should be noted that not everyone is a terrible driver here. It's just that the number of bad drivers seems abnormally high.

Edit 2: Thanks for the comments

About the Cat

He's a three year old short hair cat. He's playful and answers to his name, sometimes running into walls headfirst in the process. He loves to cuddle and sleeps by my legs at night and sometimes on me. When I'm on my computer he'll sit on my lap and go to sleep or on the chair backrest and my shoulder. He's not a shy cat and walks up to anyone who visits me and plays with them.

Uses the litter box and will let you know when he's hungry. Does okay with dogs as long as they don't chase him around. He does okay with my neighbors cats when I let him out in the backyard. He loves playing in the backyard.

A particular hotel that could serve as a one-stop location for a small ceremony

Restaurants that could be rented out for a small ceremony/dinner? 

Reasonably priced photographer?

Guitarist/Singer that we could hire to play a song at the ceremony?

We want to keep this super low key and relaxed for the sake of my fiancé’s dad. There will be 20 guests at the most. We are somewhat flexible on the date, just your run of the mill hotel chains. There's gotta be some cute, hip, modern places, right? 

We briefly considered a destination wedding but I never imagined it would be like this! It just feels right though

1357773188.0,16a0pn,So UTA doesn't know why people won't ride in the winter...,jerisad,48,10,48,"So I saw [this](http://fox13now.com/2013/01/08/public-transportation-use-dips-on-red-air-days/) story about how ridership decreases on UTA on inversion days (aka-the coldest days of the year.) Below is what I wrote to them


*Last night I saw on the news that UTA was clueless as to why people were riding less frequently during an inversion, more or less, ride for free, and in the past 4 years I have relied on Frontrunner and the busses to get me from Salt Lake to Ogden for school almost daily. It was never quite as convenient as driving but it was worth it. This year it is no longer worth it. 

I first noticed a major issue when you began running test trains from South of Salt Lake. When those trains were running the train arrived consistently late to Salt Lake, which made me 10-15 minutes late to class every day, which is just not an option. The reduced hours on frontrunner have also been a problem. If you look at this image: http://i.imgur.com/nJppr.jpg , the red line indicates the train that would get me to school on time, notably absent. This is the train that allows people traveling to Ogden to reach nearly any destination by 9am. While students may not be a high priority for UTA, there are certainly plenty of people who need to reach work around 9am, I can’t imagine a worse route to cut. Because of this scheduling my options are to either be 45 minutes early or 15 minutes late to my class


I also leave school around 7:15pm, I am stuck waiting another hour for a train, and about 45 minutes of that is in the cold, dark, alone, in downtown Ogden. If you recall, last week after dark temperatures did not break 20F, it is little comfort when there is no security around to see something if it were to happen. 

After the 2.5 hour journey from bus stop to my car in Salt Lake, once again without any security in sight. The Provo line is a nice idea, but as of right now there is NOT enough parking in Salt Lake City, and I often have to park much closer to the Rio Grande building than I would like. I think it is very ironic that your commercials show a very hip young woman taking frontrunner to yoga and trax to the symphony. What they do not show is her making that same journey, alone, after dark, in reverse to get home, especially since the hours were first cut several years ago

I told her I didn't know of any parking ticket and asked her if she could send me the information

She said that they tried to mail me a letter about the ticket, and which I traded in in January for a new car.) She then said they also tried to mail something to another address they had on file, which was my current address, except she had the wrong apartment number. So essentially, they failed to deliver any notification of a ticket to me because I didn't get a physical ticket, and they couldn't get letters to me. 

So I gave her my accurate address and she sent me a notice that didn't give any details about the date of the parking ticket, entered in both my current and old license plate numbers, and saw my ticket record for my old car, with yes, an outstanding ticket (incidentally, I looked at my calendar from back at that date and I did leave my car overnight in an area that had a time limit because I had too much to drink that night, and I remember expecting a ticket but being glad I didn't get one.) 

So I called this Rebecca Taylor back and left messages saying that I acknowledged the ticket, they are saying I owe them $125.) However, Rebecca Taylor, being a soul-sucker who works for a soulless agency, without a shred of humanity, has ignored my messages. I went ahead and paid the $125 today because I don't want my credit impacted and I don't have time to fight this in court.

I'm encouraging all of you though to occasionally check the city's website at www.slcgov.com and make sure you don't have phantom parking tickets. Salt Lake City can get fucked for all I care at this point and this is going to have a direct impact on how I spend my money around the community. Rebecca Taylor can pound sand too.

tl;dr - Salt Lake City's parking authority is a bunch of pig fuckers out to rape taxpayers. You should check to make sure they aren't trying to rape you too.

redditgifts is myself and 5days and we currently live in the bay area.  We happen to really enjoy Utah (my parents live in Kaysville) and are considering a move to SLC.  We would need to open a small office in SLC and give redditgifts a nice home there!  We have two major needs that we're hoping we can get any help on (especially from fellow redditors).  Here are our issues:

1. We want to buy a house.  We have been looking in 2 places (upper avenues

2. We have two children ages 8 and 10.  We want them to be in a good school but do NOT need public school.  We currently are in a charter school here in CA which focuses on community and does NOT focus on homework.  We LOVE this school and it is probably the only sticking point in our prospective move to UT.  So

We are also not religious (are atheist) so we don't want to live in happy valley or whatever.

Note: I left out bookstores like the Golden Braid because, well-read and broad reader.

Now

1 - (Sam) Weller's Book Works: Formally known as Sam Weller's book store and centrally located in downtown where Eborn books is located, to build a used book collection on the cheap, for things in the vein of William Burroughs, classics, and other 60s books like the Beats.  It also has one of the best Art, Cooking and Children's book selections in town.  Its Art section is good and, with some digging, it has fallen flat from its previous glory on its main st location.  The philosophy section is really piss poor.  I can't speak to its history section much.  Every other genre or theme is pretty dry.  Its rare books are interesting to browse and you can find many Modern First Editions - again

Ken Sander's Rare Books - Admittedly, their prices can't be beat.  Like Weller's Book Works, they also have a hefty collection of Modern First Editions.  Regardless if you buy anything, it is worth stopping in to see all sorts of Rare books, rare ephemera from the 60s and really amazing books.  They are strong in Art (but you have to dig), fiction, Edward Abbey, craft, as well, amazing graphic novel (especially wood cut graphic novel) section and various children's books and illustrators abounds.  It is a highly eclectic book store with a constant and steady stream of new inventory.  WELL WORTH CHECKING OUT!

3- Central Book Exchange - I have been in here a few times but not much.  They have a very strong presence of general fiction, Baudriallard and plays by Joe Orton.  I don't guarantee that these titles or similar will be there however.  I find their prices to be a tad higher by a few dollars and their selection to be limited - anything you can find in the above two stores, you can find in this store for a few dollars more.  They tend to have better quality editions of books.  They also have an extensive romance section, cooking section and health/exercise section (including hiking).  They do have more newer titles than the above bookstores.  Across the street is a Barnes and Noble.  It is worth making a pitstop every once and a while to this bookstore to stock up on titles - every time I have gone in I have gone away with a few books that I would have never thought to be in Utah.  Always a pleasant surprise and worth a few hours of your time.

4- Where do I being here?? This store is a slapdash, hardback in slipcase in that section.  Their biography section is ok and their war and mythology section are worth a quick glance.  Outside of that, most everything else is not worth the time - if only just to see what junk you can find at any thrift store stuffed on the shelves in multiple copies.  Coincidentally, this book store is also a curiosity cabinet of just things interesting, banal, old and antique.  If you are downtown and have an hour to blow, go in and take a look!

5- I went to SuzyQ books today and spent two hours there.  It is small, and the price it sells them for, the amount of quality is the best out of any bookstore.  If you are looking to start your personal library - start here first! There are several GREAT titles here for a $1 in good to very good condition in the least. Melville, Vonnegut, James et al get represented here in full show.  Duras is here as well as amazing small fiction box sets.  They have a really interested collectibles section of Modern first editions.  I stumbled upon this bookstore and loved it.  Will shop here again.  The prices and quality of the editions is outstanding.  Note again: it is very small in comparison to the other bookstores.

6- This bookstore blows.  It is worth, creepy and fun to roam around in.  If you like quarterlies, you can browse old magazine and quarterlies in the eerie basement.  That is worth your time, at least once.

7- Probably the farthest bookstore I have visited in the valley.  Like Ken Sander's the inventory is always changing and is constantly different.  I really love this bookstore - it is huge, you can find something that is incredible.  There is an abundance, curiously enough, of Antonin Artuad books, many great cookbooks, many nice French language books, an ok Art section, sports and business/management books.  I would say those last three sections are bigger than they should be.  Also! Their children/illustrated book section is great for cheap quality children's illustrated books.  As you browse

8- The King's English is another staple of the literary Salt Lake scene.  I haven't been here as much as I should but it is a really great bookstore for new books.  It has the best selection (broadly over genre) of books out of any of the bookstores mentioned - this bookstore is a bit pricy (if you haven't noticed, passionate bookish staff, and location.  Its only (subjective) downturn for me is its price.  I like discovering great used books for cheap.  If you like that, this isn't the book store for you.  However, regardless of that, this bookstore is a MUST VISIT.  Still very highly recommended.

9- The Red Queen is the only speciality shop I would recommend in SLC.  It is around the corner from Ken Sanders.  It specializes in rare illustrated and book arts books.  It is worth stopping in and chatting with the proprieter who happens to also be Ken Sander's daughter! She is highly knowledgeable and more importantly

I don't care if it's just a burger joint, shitty, hole-in-the-wall place. Or just some atmosphere that you can't replicate anywhere else. It can be anywhere that has some local dish or item that you can't get anywhere else. For example, I'm from Youngstown, Ohio and we're known for two dishes: wedding soup, and more importantly, [Brier Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_Hill) pizza. We have a large Italian population. [Wedding soup](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bbYchyOWfXw/UEfk106v_3I/AAAAAAAAAMY/rEnWiIFEi4Q/s320/WeddingSoup.JPG) has gone more mainstream now but is a soup containing mostly greens such as escarole and endives, small homemade meatballs, salt and pepper, not some watered down chicken noodle soup with a meatball thrown in. And [Brier Hill pizza](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_MYRNDMf_IWo/ShiDnnVgqJI/AAAAAAAAA3o/XAGUGP_geP8/s320/Brier_Hill_Pizza_Whole.jpg) is a homemade pizza with a spicy

I’m still in disbelief about how many people I met and how much love there is in this city. It’s hard to describe it but I’ll give just a couple examples of the numerous experiences I had all week:

Betsygirl801 and Inco (Redditors) met me downtown and gave me the grand tour of SLC night life. We bar crawled all night

Another night I got off work late and stopped by The Pie for a a slice and a beer. A group of people saw me looking for a table and invited me to sit with them. They poured me a beer and didn't waste one second making me feel like a damn celebrity. Then they brought me to a bunch of their favorite spots downtown. After that they brought me back to a party at their house where they did a bunch of fire poi dancing. It felt like something out of a movie.

Here's the story ladies and gentlemen

My neighbor feeds many strays.  She works on getting them adopted, litter.  I would take him honestly, but I have two girls already and he doesn't play well with others.

He is awesome though.  He's a loner, neutered, and may be microchipped but we aren't sure.  He is crazy affectionate and loves attention.  Here, he can be a little testy because of all the other cats he has to deal with.  He has scratched me before but it was only because he was scared.  Also, he's not a mangy stray.  He's in really good shape.  In fact, he's a bit fluffier than the pictures in that album because his winter fur is crazy thick.

Here's what we're looking for:
Someone who will keep him indoors, will not have him declawed.  If he's declawed, he may become a biter.  Also, if in the worst case scenario he came back to us and needed to live as a stray again, he would be screwed without claws.  She (my neighbor) asks $30 dollars.  This is recommended by most animal welfare agencies to show the adopter is serious.  It will also help cover a small portion of the last vet bill.  

Don't be turned off by the reference to his clawing

**TL;DR: I have a stray in my house.  He is amazing and is well deserving of a home.  Contact me and save a kitty.**

Usually when you donate through DonorsChoose, to you redditors, if you donate over $10 (so it'll be $20 with the code), message me and I'll have a few of my students write you a thank you note.

We'd love to take you to breakfast and interview you.

**The Details**

On July 18, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

Does anyone have any media contacts we can tell his story to?",pixel8,26,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/u55i6/im_beyond_horrified_a_teen_was_kidnapped_in_utah/

A teen was being held at [Discovery Academy](http://www.discoveryacademy.com/) in Provo, keeping him past his 18th birthday is illegal. He had committed no crime, was not ordered there by the courts, as a matter of fact his mother sent him there because he was depressed after his father died.

They kept him for months after his 18th birthday. His mother insisted he stay there, Mark Levine. He called and got nowhere as well. Two nights ago he did a [show exposing the situation](http://marklevine.tv/does-the-city-of-provo-endorse-kidnapping/). Yesterday he called back and pressed the police, and magically they let him go. Fortunately, is safe now.

Mark details the ordeal everyone went through in this [radio show](http://marklevine.tv/patrick-is-free/) tonight. I'll give you some of the main points:

- The police seemed initially interested, and this was pointed out to them.** 

- What gets even weirder is the officer told advocates that she had met with the teen and he said he was fine and wanted to stay. The teen had been begging his girlfriend and her mother to get him out

- Even weirder is when Mark Levine called, he would not call the kidnappers and ask them their policy. She still refused to budge or help him.

- The FBI said it did not meet their criteria and did nothing.

- CPS would not get involved because he had turned 18 and was no longer a minor.

- The local disability rights org, which would take at least a month, and probably drag out longer. Also, his mother claimed he was disabled when she enrolled him, but now said that he wasn't. 

- There are allegations that Discovery Academy abused the teen

What finally happened is that Mark called back yesterday. After getting nowhere with the same officer, the Discovery Academy released the teen. They threw him to the streets with no money, an advocate took $670 out of her own pocket to buy him a plane ticket back to Massachusetts. Another advocate met him at the his layover location to give him some food and a little spending money. Discovery charges somewhere in the neighborhood of $60/k a year, you would think if they care about kids they would've treated him better.

I'm beyond shocked. Discovery Academy does not surprise me, but that was after months of inaction. No one has been arrested; no one at the school, and certainly not that police officer. If you or I decided to hold someone captive at our house, you better believe the SWAT team would be all over us.

Does anyone have any media contacts we can get his story out to? People in Utah need to know about this. I can put the media in touch with the advocates who tried to help him, thank you, [/r/SaltLakeCity](/r/SaltLakeCity), for any help you can give.

My thought was that Provo would be a good spot for her because of BYU and all the young adults there, day care for her daughter, etc. She is a hard worker and wants to get a job and some independence. I'm helping her as much as I can, but she doesn't want to feel like she's mooching off her brother. I wanted to see if I could get some direction from some locals.

I need your help for a project that will bring me to Salt Lake City to teach folks how to organize mesh networks.

My proposal, and the routers that we set up together will remain with people in Salt Lake to seed your own mesh networks. With these seeds spread, organizers and technologists in Salt Lake can continue to grow locally-managed networks and spur innovation on a shared platform accessible to any resident.
