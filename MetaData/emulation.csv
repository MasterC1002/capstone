**Actions Tutorial**

To swing the sword

Sword Jab- R3


**Spin Strikes**-

 Vertical spin strike: hit L3 and R3 while moving the right analog stick up or down AT THE SAME TIME

Horizontal spin strike: Hit the modifier and Rotate the left analog stick counter-clockwise and the right one clockwise AT THE SAME TIME (you dont need to hit the modifier and do the circles at the same time, it wont read the move.
If you are having trouble with that motion, just avoid the skulltulas and you don't need to finish the log chopping practice at the very beggining

**Shield Block**- L3

**Skyward Strike**- Hold up on the Dpad until charged

**Finishing Blow**- Let go of the Left trigger button and quickly press R3 and L3 at same time

**Throwing/Rolling Bombs**-Press up on the Dpad to throw

**Rolling**- Hit L3 while dashing

**Shaking**-Hit L3 and R3 to shake enemies off of you or shake out of webs

**Leaping on vines/edges**- Hit R3

**Taking out the goddes Sword**- Press Dpad down to enter the ""ready"" stance

**Bird Controls**- Dpad to steer. To gain altitude you hold the left trigger and move the right stick up

**Tightrope Controls**- Hold Left trigger and use right stick to balance with Left and RIght. Up and down makes the rope shake off enemies

**Slingshot/Hookshot/Bow**
These controls are very problematic. because when you hold the modifier (Left trigger) it messes with your view. so you are stuck with a limited range of movement for the pointer. To help with this make sure you are facing what you are trying to hit . Press up-down on the d-pad until it stops within the range that you can point to. This is very finnicky and wonky and hitting the modifier too many times can mess up the controls requiring you to savestate and restart. But with enough patience and luck

**Gliding Controls**-Up d-pad slows you down keeps you by bottom of screen

**Harp**- Press right bumper to bring it out. hold A and left trigger and move the right thumbstick ( I use an arcing motion) You move to each side of the thumbstick when the light circle is about to change direction or has just changed. It takes a bit of practice but you'll get the hang of it

**Special Cases**

**Bird Race**- Un-bind(or to a different key) the Z key on the nunchuk

**Eye doors** -Make a new control configuration, Yaw left as left arrow and Yar right as right. Quickly go ULDR on the keyboard.

**Circle Symbol Drawing**- Choose hybrid wiimote setting

**Trial Slash**-Make another config. Thrust as dpad up

**Fun-Fun Island Gliding Minigame**- Limit the fps in the config and use save states. 


**Slight Spoilers Beyond**


**Tentalus**-After the skyward strike is charged

**Ghirahim Battles**
Hold left trigger and hold right thumbstick to the right so your sword points that way. Use up and down to dpad to strike 

If the game isn't receiving inputs from the gamepad (say you just loaded the game and a save state) Switch the wiimote from emulated to hybrid wiimote (or vice versa) press ok and then switch back again. (You may not have to ever do this

If you de-check the reconnect wii mote on state loading option

I finally finished a little pet project today after years of procrastination.  Had this old hard drive from my Atari ST on a shelf in the garage (bought in 1992 for $400!).  It contained artwork, letters, etc. from the 80s and 90s that I wanted to be able to save before the disk ceased to function.

It was a ""SupraDrive, but I had long since abandoned that very ancient (but cool) machine.  However, I had known for some time that inside the enclosure was a standard 3.5"" SCSI hard drive.  So I opened it up and removed the drive (a Quantum, nice!) in hopes of hooking it up to a SCSI card I had bought off eBay.  

Except the SCSI card was dead.  In fact my PC wouldn't even POST with it in.  More Ebay junk.  Damn.  Looked at the Adaptec card and saw one of its components (a crystal oscillator) had come unsoldered.  I figured I got nothing to lose in trying to solder it back on.

30 minutes later

But now Windows 7 has no idea how to read the Atari hard disk

Loaded up the emulator and pointed it to the disk image.  Magic!  My virtual Atari booted up just like it did before I scrapped it in the late 90s.  And all those lost files are now saved on my modern PC.

List of consoles and their state (emulated/physical/etc):

- Gameboy (Color) - Emulated via PC

- Nintendo 64 - Emulated via PC

- Gameboy Advance - Emulated via PC

- Gamecube - Physical console

- Nintendo DS - Physical console and/or emulated via PC

- Wii - Softmodded console

Okay

So

1. Can I transfer Pokemon from the Gameboy games into the Stadium [N64] games if I'm emulating all of it?

2. Is there any way to transfer Pokemon from the GB games into the Advance games? I'm willing to manually enter all of their stats into a save file creator or something (I have two different Action Replay devices for NDS as well

3. If I get a flash cart for GBA

4. I'm pretty sure it's still impossible

I'd appreciate pretty much any advice. Now that I'll have some free time on my hands

Also, I would play Red, Blue, Yellow, Stadium 1, Silver, Gold, Stadium 2, Colosseum, Pokemon Box (To manage the massive collection I would have at this point)

If I have time after this, Mystery Dungeon series, Conquest, etc... but those don't have the ability (or any potential way/reason) to import Pokemon, so they're not my top priority right now.

So yeah

It uses a combination of libretro (so the same emulation cores/ save states etc. as RetroArch) and hijacking other programs to expose them as scriptable objects in a 2D/3D graphics engine (see the wiki for the LUA API). These can then be used to do all crazy sort of things (too long a list to bore you with here but there's everything from video encoding/decoding to shaders in there) but the most used part is 'Gridle'

Bigger points in this release is the addition of networked remote control / secondary displays and a specialized tool just for streaming.

n64oid and fpse can also use the hard analog sticks

Also, i haven't tried personally, just watched it on youtube. Important to note though, is that if you downgrade you lose all of your apps, so if you're thinking about overclocking make sure it's the first thing you do.

All I need is something that accepts input from my 360 wireless controller

I've not once been able to get XBMC's Advanced Launcher or Rom Collection Browser to index my SNES roms or launch N64 roms.  

I was told ""use hyperspin"" so I spent a month and a half torrenting a huge collection of videos in a ""basic"" hyperspin deployment.  Then found out that (a) there is no clean way to remove games I don't own,entiom it is flashy, noisy, obtrusive, and doesn't serve my regular-PC-game launching. 

So I switched to Steam Big Picture mode

In theory, and then injecting the ROM file name as a launch modifier. This would be all kinds of time prohibitive, since we are talking about roughly 200 games to map.  

Why is this so hard? I can configure the cmd-line-happy emulators myself.  But I need something clean to navigate with, then it's broken. I can't be the only person desperate for a better solution. ",,False,self,t5_2qh6d,False,,

There is a wireless adapter on the MoBo and I can overclock with it. That's why I chose it. 

The case is small but looks like the air flow is decent enough to overclock.

I took a ""Gold certified"" PSU because they usually run cooler and quieter.

Overall

- Could I pick cheaper parts for the same performance or better?
- Is my GPU strong enough for Wii/Gamecube/PS2? 
- How will Dolphin run with this?

I have an... *acceptable* PC gaming setup. It's nothing amazing and the card is outdated but it all does the trick and can run a lot of modern games quite well on their highest settings with minimal to no problems.

So I recently upgraded my Dolphin to the latest build, so I upgraded and followed the settings the Dolphin wiki suggests: LLE, Framerate limit to Audio, and EFB copies to RAM.

Well... it's certainly better, fluctuating from quiet to sound over and over. I'd say 3-4 audio cut outs per second. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's choppy. 

Anyway, fine. Framerate, nice. Audio, gross. Any ideas on what I could do to alleviate the issue? I've looked around online for quite a while and have found nothing, and toyed with the settings a restarted the game for over an hour, no dice.

I tried PM: TTYD, and the audio lags a bit in-game, nothing bad or cringe inducing, so... not sure if that could help you at all.

I have been working on building an emulator PC and I was using hyperspin for my frontend.

That program was just taking up way too much of my free time. I'm in the process of switching to Maximus Arcade. This program seems a lot more straight forward. I know it's not free and I'm willing to pay the $25. My only gripe with it is that I can't seem to figure out is how to add videos to it. There are absolutely no tutorials on how to do this on youtube or the net period. 

Now

I'm talking about little ""snipet previews"" when you scroll over the games so it can play a preview video for the game. 

I currently have all of the video files for all of the games I have. I just need to find a way to import them into Maximus and get them to work with each game.

Hello, but I happen to move around a fair amount, so I thought it'd be easier to rip my PS2 library to .isos and run them like PC games through an emulator. 

However, which given the MCBoot install methods isn't exactly easy (or certain, in some cases), and then the more convenient option, use a PS3 memory card adapter.

Only issue is, besides getting the adapter recognizable and PS1 memory cards accessible through it. All the posts I've seen related to this have been around 4 to 2 years old, with a few year old posts yearning for the option. So I guess I'm joining those year old posters in asking: has anything changed on this? Any progress that my search phrasing has overlooked? 

Also, then to a flash drive, then using appropriate software on the PC to import them into the emulator memory cards would work? Oh, and as a question out of nowhere that is still related, can a PS2 multitap access the memory cards without plugging into a controller port?

1375285302.0,1jfda8,Review - JXD S5110b,vsilvalopes,9,0,7,"Hi Guys!

After 20 days of wait
So
The quick answer is
But you will have to spend some time tweaking the device before it gets perfect ! So, it's a great device.

So

* Build Quality 

The device doesn't seems and feel like a cheap device.
The device has a good grip and good weight. Not much to talk about it in here.

The buttons are great too. 
Response is what you expect. 
No delays
All the games and emulators that I tested went fine with the controls.

* Software

I've didn't tried the stock ROM
The ROM is from the Open Handhelds [Open Handhelds Forum] (http://forum.openhandhelds.net/index.php/board

This ROM fixes a lot of problems of the original firmware. Like the Analongs not being real analogs. You can read the full change log and see for yourself. 

But I really recomend using it, use it ! 

The only problem that I faced is with the Android Governors.
The device has a bug, all the emulators or games became ULTRA SLOW. If you touch the screen, everything goes back to normal.

This is because of the way that THIS particular version of Android for the device handles the power saving. When the device goes to Sleep
This makes anything that you trie to play a pain. 

So
The device has root out of the box
In this post [Fix for the Wake up Bug] (http://forum.openhandhelds.net/index.php/topic

After this

* Battery

This is the only real thing that I don't like in the device.
The battery supports 2:30 hours of Gameplay
For me that only use the device on the subway in my way to home or work
But for long trips

I'm doing some research in changing it. My discoverires so far are that if I use a same voltage battery I can go without trouble

The other problem is that the battery takes a long time to full recharge. About 2 hours with the device powered off.

* Games

The machine has a dual core processor.
So playing games isn't a problem at all.
I tried on the device 

- Max Payne
- GTA 3
- GTA Vice City
- Shadowgun
- Dead Trigger

All games runned fine. 
No slowdowns

The Skel Rom bundles TinCore Keymapper
So games like Max Payne that don't support joystick out of the box can be played with it.
Played 2 hours of Max Payne
You spend some time tweaking Tincore and your game. But once you adjust the controls

* Emulation

All the emulators that I tried run fine on the device.
The only exception is the PSP one. But I think this is more an emulator cause than the device.
I have a Galaxy Nexus phone 

List emulators I tested with sucess.

- NES.emu (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- GBC.emu (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- Snes9X EX+ (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- MD.emu (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- Muppen64 Plus AE (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- FPSe (Full Speed/Partial Joystick Support - Doesn't recognize the second analog)
- My Boy (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- SuperGNES (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- ePSXe (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support)
- DosBox Turbo (Full Speed/Full Joystick Support - Only played Alone in the Dark on it)

I still have to test :

- Mame4Droid
- PCE.emu
- ScummVM
- aFBA
- Ataroid

I tried Retroarch, I will come back to it, IF I find some game that I cannot play on other emulators. For now, It will be in stand by.

I don't think I will have speed problems with the remaing emulators to test

* Continue using my Samsung Galaxy SIII with the classic Wii controller/purchase a PS3 controller?
* Emulate on the Galaxy Tab? Is this powerful enough to emulate well
* Buy an Xperia Play? (The appeal here lies in my knowledge of the Android operating system as well as the built in game controls).

It's really not much of a computer but it was free and I think I can get it to do most of what I need. Here's what I'm doing/thinking.

I have it hooked up to my 47"" vizio and have installed k-fusion and snes9x (it runs these nicely). The small footprint makes the computer ideal as it fits very conspicuously below my very minimalist entertainment center thing. The TV is wall mounted. The OptiPlex also has ten, as a result I plan to keep using this computer despite its apparent flaws. 

The integrated graphics surprisingly will perform a resolution that fits my vizio (1920x1050 or whatever). However, I am going to upgrade the video card to something cheap with 1gb dedicated memory. Given these two changes I beleive the computer should be completely capable of running these emulators as I have had lesser computers run them at good consistent 60fps.

It should be noted that I would like to do an N64 emulator and Dreamcast as well, should I be looking for something more than described above? 

With my other emulator setups I typically just use my old Super Nintendo controller with a two controller usb hub. Aggravatingly I have to configure the controller setups every time I run SNES9x or K-fusion. Is there a work around for this? Do usb controllers fix this? I will likely soon purchase n64 type controllers

It's the first emulator that I've found running under Java which always had a bad connotation in my mind but it works under both windows and linux. Development is in beta but 300+ games are compatible.

Video has 1x

There is very little documentation on in game settings but the forums are active. I have a question in about video settings specifically so hopefully I can make it look even prettier. Even so

I'm running a quad core machine with 4gb memory and a GTS 250.

Windows 7 64bit - still using 32 bit version of JPCSP and 32 bit Java runtime environment. (the forums say it works better this way)

Other necessary download is Sony SonicStage for audio. free download.

Tested game: FF7 Crisis Core. With default settings it ranges from 30-45 FPS. With boxes checked for compatibility it stays at max framerate but doesn't tell me what that actually is. (it reads as 11 FPS lol).

I wrote an image file of the game and it doesn't seem to want to play the music with either ePSXe or PCSXR. For a little while I thought it did with PCSXR

I checked another person's image of the game and found that it was ripped to several .bin files, but it looks like it *should* function more or less the same as Imgburn, from what I can tell, but I did give CloneCD a shot once without it really doing much differently.

Can anyone here give me a hand? This is really frustrating

Any help would be much appreciated. 

**Edit:** 
Key problem:
Multi-track audio game ripping to one .bin file. The .cue picks that up and rolls with it. Modifying it only results in either no music (i.e. more of the same) or awful static garbage. 

Solution being sought:
A method to rip the game into multiple .bin files so it will hopefully generate the appropriate .cue and run the music. 

What I currently have:
A functioning image of the game in all rights

Emulators tried:

* ePSXe
* PCSXR
* Retroarch
* Mednafen

Software tried:

* IMGBurn
* CloneCD

Hello

My problem is that I'm using a Retrolink usb controller to set up with the RetroPie project software RetroArch and the configuration is not working.  The front end menu works fine, the buttons are recognized.  I don't know why these changes won't take with the emulators but I suspect that the emulators are reading another file to get the configuration.  I've deleted the retroarch.cfg file before and it still runs all the buttons except up and left.

So if anyone knows answers to these questions

- Why would the ""up"" and ""left"" buttons not work upon the configuration to begin with?
- How can the configuration stick even when retroarch.cfg is deleted?
- Why does altering the retroarch.cfg file alter joyconfig's ability to detect my 'up' and 'left' buttons but not the emulator's ability to do so?

The only emulator who was able to provide me with the best in out-of-the-box functionality along with reliability was pSX. However, even though I was able to beat Breath of Fire IV with the same controller, analogs included. Also, there are some aspect ratio problems.

People tell me (and did so as well on the thread I mentioned) to use ePSXe. Ok. Last time I checked...

* it had way too many plugins to take account of and no way to know which are best
* for some reason the analog stick would start turned off even in games that support it. My emulation rig won't have a keyboard

I'm looking into what's best for PlayStation emulation nowadays. And little did I know the situation is even worse than N64 emulation! I really need the help of someone who's experienced with it. Can someone recommend me the best one?

Those seem to be the most popular/most recommended:

ePSXe: I've got it working with reliable plugins, then.

pSX: Seems barebones compared to the others and lacks lots of configs. I've had some compatibility issues with it. Also

A few years ago I bought a game called ""Metal Arms: Glitch in the System"" and it quickly became my favorite game of all time.

Fast forward to today and I'm having a nostalgia trip. So I decide to search the Internet dry for builds of the game and I end up with all three versions of it on my harddrive (Xbox, PS2 emulators I still can't figure out, but then there's Dolphin.

I actually managed to hook up my Xbox360 controller to work with Dolphin so the program works. I've even managed to get the game working... sort of.

It shows me the title screen. It sounds exactly as I remember it and it also look exactly as I remember it. But there's a problem. Whenever I start a game, but freezes. Like it only updates the image when I force it to.

This is quite annoying. I'd *love* for this to work. I'm so damn close to re-living my favorite game of all time... but the program is mocking me!
