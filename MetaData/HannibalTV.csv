Hannibal is headed by Bryan Fuller.  Back in 2003 he created a show called Dead Like Me.  The lead character was Georgia (George) played by Ellen Muth

Jump to episode 10 of Hannibal, Ellen Muth, suffering from Cotard's Syndrome, a condition where she thinks she is dead.

Bryan Fuller was basically able to setup a hidden storyline so that Dead Like Me wound up being an entire delusion Georgia experienced while suffering from Cotard's Syndrome.

1368172983.0,1e23sh,Franklin. Hannibal. One in the same?,cjsd815,40,4,31,"""I hate being this neurotic.""
""If you weren't neurotic

This is the first exchange we see between these two characters, in the pilot episode. I was thinking about this earlier today before even watching Sorbet (I'm still not entirely sure why) and the episode further solidified in my mind that there is a pretty god damn deep connection between these two men. To one of them, it is fantasized and infatuated. To the other, it's off-putting, maybe even a teeny, tiny bit frightening (this is Hannibal we're talking about, after all).

Franklin's neuroses are, crippled mess, he has a friend that he obviously somewhat enjoys the company of, and he can handle himself in public.

However, everyone at the opera seems to want a piece of Hannibal, but Franklin really needs a friend. In a delusional sense, too. The guy thinks he could have saved Michael Jackson. ""In this Michael Jackson fantasy, how is your friendship returned?"" Hannibal asks. Franklin responds with the very simple and honest response, ""I just get to touch greatness.""

And then Hannibal begins his own soul-searching as a result of this. How many friends does Hannibal *really* have? We see the obvious addressing of this issue when Hannibal, and skin complexion we've ever seen him have, goes to see Agent Scully for a therapy session. She lays out, in very cold and blatant terms, the nature of their relationship (she offers him a glass of wine, just because she's not officially a psychologist anymore, but that's it). And we see him in a strange mirror of Franklin's position

Hannibal asserts, and opportunities of friends. That he and she are friendly. When she dispassionately refutes that he is her patient and colleague and nothing more, it's hard not to notice the slight sting of loneliness that she mentioned on Mikkelsen's chiseled, disciplined expression.

And then

And then he offers Alana a glass of beer from ""her own private reserve"" brewed and bottled by Hannibal himself

But then the second appointment with Franklin comes along, Hannibal asks two very intuitive yet very spontaneous questions:

""Do you desire Tobias
and
""You care deeply about Tobias. Despite differences

Now, Hannibal is trying desperately to cultivate real relationships with people he truly has something in common with, even when they are really his adversaries. Hannibal's grand dinner parties are with people he couldn't care less about, with people demanding the luxury and excess he's proven so capable of providing.

However, Alana, or Abigail ever *invited* Hannibal, in a personal manner, to come see them? He shows up unannounced at the hospital to see Abigail several times, and even seeks Will out fairly late at night two hours after he's missed his appointment. These are all people Hannibal clearly likes, and in certain cases, as he cares deeply for them

My conclusion, as has been mentioned before in this subreddit, clearly paternal, and I would argue that he is falling very much in love with Will, to the point that I see his flirtations with Alana more than anything as a power play to make Will jealous.

This is, open admission that he had ""tried things"" in fraternities and that Tobias was simply ""not his brand"") are something truly unique to this show and they set an enormously ambitious precedent for the following seasons, should they happen.

This is exactly what I see people saying a few years from now when they finally grasp onto the bandwagon. 

I love this show because it is slow in its reveals. Most people wanted the opposite. They want the pilot to show Hannibal going all crazy on someone. They preferred to see an hour long shit fest of rancid jokes and an obvious tie-in to the movies or something

Sadly Hannibal doesn't deliver on the ""Honey Boo Boo"" crowd. And I think most people in this area of reddit know why.

The story is incredibly done. The character development has had me on the edge of my seat. I almost feel a sense of ""Fireflyesque"" nostalgia. Seeing the story develop over the first season and how each person just glimpses at another piece of their personality each episode is amazing to watch. I know this Hannibal ultimately gets caught and turned into what we first see in Silence of the Lambs

Mads deserves all kinds of awards for the roles in this show and movies he has done. He is an amazing actor. From portraying a stone-cold viking who never has to say a word in-order to make people cower

Hugh Dancy...It's hard to describe. His acting is perfect for a ""paranoid

 It's amazing to think this show is supposed to have more seasons with what's already been revealed. It has an inevitable end. I can only hope the writing does not try to ""fluff"" a season or two up. I don't think other shows would be as popular if the writers wrote for it to have no clear ending.

""Fireflyesque""


Edit Afterthought: This takes place before ""Red Dragon"".   This is going to be interesting to see how these writers work.

- I both love and hate the mental instability of Will Graham at the same time. It's fascinating

- There's too much going on. Every episode, but these aren't any killers, they are total 'psychos'. So far, we have [Spoiler](/s ""A cannibal (in addition to Hannibal), a guy who uses victims as a fertilizer to grow mushrooms, a 'mother figure' who has children kill their parents and someone who transforms his victims into angels."") And that's only up to ep 5, where I am at the moment. That's a lot happening in a very short space of time, playing second fiddle (rightly) to more important back stories. And this ties in to my next point.

- Everything is solved far too easily. The realisation process seems very rushed to me. One second, it just seems like Will is more an all seeing god than a behavioral science investigator.

That being said

My concern is that they are rushing through the 1st season and ""firing all of their guns at once"" (kind of like Lie to Me did) with nothing for season 2 other than a bunch of boring character exploration and interplay of who's gonna fuck who kind of thing.

Will

Hannibal is struggling because he wants to be ""normal"" and feel things  and have relationships like a human

Hannibal killed the girl in the field to play with Will and show him that he was in fact an artist and more evolved killer than Hobbs, Hannibal is such a sociopath that he cannot feel anything, and he was just trying to feel the intense love that Hobbs felt and figured recreating his murder could provide him that glimpse of feeling.

His other murders are for his food - which replaced his career as a surgeon - a failed career because he messed up

He needs this confirmation because he actually lacks creativity because he doesn't have feelings.  Yes he likes art, clothing, but I think its all at such effort.  all those endeavors are so perfect, by the book if you will, that there is no creative expression.

We know Hannibal has been manipulating Will to get him to believe he's killed; to make him more like Hannibal himself.  Having Will incarcerated may have also been the plan as it attacks Will's already weakened psyche and allows Hannibal to offer his professional assistance to help Will get better; to get closer to Will.
But all of this is to what end?  Is he playing with Will?  Is he merely just curious to see what happens?  Or is he trying to bring Will closer?  Is he trying to shape Will into someone who could accept his true self?  Is he trying to make a friend?
I think the answer to this lies in my favourite scene of the series.  I can't find a link to it, then feigning disinterest, then a hint of sadness - tells me that he really, really wanted to see Will.  His reaction almost seemed a little petulant (fine, I didn't want to see Will anyway).  Mads played it perfectly.  I doubt the scene last more than 10 seconds, but it's exposes so much of Hannibal.  Because no one else is there, this is pure Hannibal.  Any 'acting' he does is to fool himself, but you can see that he's really hurt by it.  He wanted to play with his new friend

 Abel is a biblical forename that comes from the word for 'breath' or 'vapor' in Hebrew. It is connected to the biblical story of Cain and Abel which, Cain is the murderer while Abel is the victim which makes for an interesting name choice in the show as Dr. Abel Gideon, while an evil person, has been victimized by many Psychiatrists (including Hannibals mind-games in the episode) into making him think he is the Ripper...which gets him into the story...which gets him killed.

Cain, because of that capability was thought to be the offspring of Satan, or Satan himself. This fits nicely as, we who have seen the episode know that, Hannibal clearly gets Abel killed and Mads as well as many others have described the character of Hannibal as ""satan or the embodiment of him"" which connects Hannibal to Cain thus completing the correlation.

Another connection is that, vapor), Hannibal wields control over Abel (breath, vapor)

Six episodes into this season, and mental stability, the overarching theme of Hannibal's first season could be established with dreams as the battleground for the soul.  Will Graham fights for the soul day and night, though whether he is winning is up for debate.

Will Graham's inability to sleep at night results in sleepwalking, can appreciate why they were committed in the first place, but his sense of morality punishes himself for that thought.  There is cognitive dissonance in Will Graham's head over his soul's battle for good and evil; he doesn't know which side will win.

His ability to empathize with the killers the FBI hunts always begins with the metronome windshield washer that swipes the screen, so following that logic, he's wiping away his ability to be good.  It would appear after each entrance/exit to each world, he's losing pieces of himself.  He comes back more empathetic, more understanding of the violence, and more horrified of the battle he's losing.

Will's brain ultimately wants him to win on the side of good, that one murder out of the others, is extremely important.  It haunts him and the feathered stag is his brain screaming, Hannibal walks and watches beside you.

With the disillusion of canonical future events in the sixth episode Entrée, the evil and good, is out the window.  With this new timeline, Will might very well fail.  There is no guarantee that he will win at the end of the day and that makes this series all the more exciting.  Based on his latest reaction after entering his dream world, eye for an eye, his evil side is pulling ahead and this presents interesting opportunities to come.",,self,,

I, on a massive cliff-hanger. This thought is usually what stops me from buying any blu rays of a season until I know for sure it's getting a proper ending. Yet for some reason, in this year 2013 I have at least 2 shows *(including Hannibal)* that I am considering just getting anyway because of how fucking good their first season was. The other show, Banshee, I have more faith in but the whole point of this post is that NBC is a broadcast network, has a shoddy history of seemingly caring more about the ratings than giving the show a proper chance, and Hannibal is such a big hit in terms of quality I'm afraid NBC just isn't sure how to handle it and might butcher it in later seasons with forced product placement or firing writers/showrunners to artificially keep the story going.

 Essentially the show satisfies my curiosities about crime, and even… food.  I think all George Costanza would be missing for his trifecta is sports, but really isn’t murder just another kind of sport. 


The genius behind this show, Hannibal Lecter, and gives us more of him every week. It is well written, well filmed, well lit, well-acted , well

And to top of all of this it incorporates gastronomy in a way I have never seen a show like this (besides maybe the Sopranos with Italian food) have done before. 

I do have one small criticism, as you would think a show of its kind would on NBC. 

However

Really I would just like to see the Asian chick in lingerie and I would happy.

The thing about everyone is that they believe they have good intentions. We justify our actions, in turn, his daughter - by putting 'every part of them' to good use. The pharmacist believed he was unifying people with the earth and making something beautiful. Angel-maker was, well, making angels (and imo this was the best exploration of morals) of demons. Regardless of their intent, the result was death.

What is Hannibal doing? What makes Hannibal creepy is that he doesn't appear to have very good intentions at all. He seems to be killing *for the sake of killing* - he has no justification for his actions

So, the general population, perceive as good? At a time, slavery was considered good and a norm, but is not good today; what and *who* does the value of 'good' depend on? If serial killers, generally labeled by society as 'bad', have good intentions, or is killing bad no matter what? Are we even good

Clearly, it poses the question - what makes someone good?

I could have phrased this a lot better

**tl;dr** - what do you believe makes a person 'good'? Is it possible for a serial killer, why do you think he saved Abigail, and what is his motive/justification?

I'm kind of...confused. I can't figure out how many of these kills are by Hannibal's hand directly

It starts basically from the beginning. So there's that guy who was killing the college girls, because of the whole ""he's eating them"" thing. Turns out no, this other guy is a cannibal too! Then, there is a copycat. Is *that* Hannibal?

Then we get the murderers all the way up to the Chesapeake Ripper. It seems pretty clear that Hannibal is not involved in the other murderers (the lost boys, but....he's not? It's actually Hannibal? Yet this guy seems to know intimate details of the Chesapeake Ripper, and the show seems to imply that the mental-institute guy knew details that no one else knew. How did he know them?

Then there's this ""organ havester"" guy, taking their organs to eat, while this guy is killing people and taking their organs to sell? Was he set up by hannibal?

So far I am very happy with it

Mad Mikkelsen is brilliant as Lecter. As soon as he started talking I was impressed, you know that what he says is never what he means. There's always a sub-text to everything he says, and what he does.

My only gripe with the show is Will Graham being on the autistic/aspergers spectrum. To the best of my memory

*Having said that, it weaves into the story and creates a dark connection between Graham and the sociopaths he is devoted to stopping.

1372194650.0,1h2avo,Foreshadowing in Hannibal (TV show) from the books.,Beefcakev1,14,5,8,"Hi I am a big fan of the Hannibal books. Watching the TV show I noticed a lot of foreshadowing from the books that people may not have picked up on. I thought I would list them

1. How Jack Crawford's new partner that he pulled out of classes catches Hannibal the same exact way Will catch's Hannibal in the book Red Dragon. Even down to Hannibal taking off his shoes and sneaking behind him. The only difference is that Will makes a phone call so the FBI bust in right before he was killed. Although Hannibal does nearly disembowel him. 

2. Buffalo Bill parallel. Hannibal meets the serial killer Tobias Budge through one of his patents. This is also how Hannibal met Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb.  Gumb was involved in a relationship with Hannibal's patent.  To add Hannibal ended of killing the patent mirroring the way he killed Tobias's friend. 

3. Will fixing boat motors. After Will catches Hannibal (In the book Red Dragon) he retires to the beach with his family and fixes boat motors for money. He's seen fixing a boat motor in some episodes. 

4. The way Jack finds Miriam Lass

5. Will and his family would take in stray dogs that were lost at his beach house. His wife even says he was obsessed with the dogs.

6. Also if your wondering what the swinging thing is before Will approaches a scene heres an excerpt from the book before he approaches the Leed's house (A crime scene). 'He tried to be still inside. In his mind a silver pendulum swung in darkness. He waited until the pendulum was still.'

7. Will would have surreal violent nightmares about his cases and wake up ringing wet from sweat. 

8. The ending! This is huge foreshadowing but I'm sure you knew that.

That's all I can think of for now. If I got something wrong or forgot something......or If you think this is stupid please tell me.

You know how Hannibal offered Alana beer, hahaha that beer has people in it, doesn't it, and then you focus on the awkward flirting. But. He said that the beer took TWO years to make. 

As you know

Miriam Lass was killed two years ago.

Her arm was basically perfect when they found it in that observation hub thing. Obviously it had to be preserved.

That preservation juice it must have been floating in for two years? 
Probably fermented.

She was drinking fermented preservation juice thing which used to be in a jar with Miriam Lass' arm.

So

I could think of two key aspects of his motivation: 

A) He is interested in the way the mind

B) (this is the more interesting one I was not sure was discussed before:) 
**Maybe he wants to create something like an equal to himself?** 

Hannibal already said that there are many similarities between the two of them. But Hannibal is arguably less sane than him.

 ^(I know that Hannibal was described as very sane and very rational

So

He does view Will as some kind of a friend, insane person? 

This idea kind of intrigues me because it seems really fitting. I think Hannibal would like the idea of *creating somebody in his image*

I am a die-hard book fan and have been since I was young (probably too young to be in the proper age group to read them :P) to the point that I'm a criminal justice major because of the fascinations the books sparked in me.  I re-read them all once a year and Silence of the Lambs several times as often. Always a new sense of enjoyment. :)

As far as movies go I was moderately pleased with Manhunter and Hannibal Rising and extraordinarily pleased with Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Silence is my favorite movie of all time and a shining example of book-to-movie adaptations

And so I was excited but horrified to hear about this series when it was first announced. I've been so very curious but terribly wary of the show. It could be amazing or it could be Hannibal all over again. Of course the series wouldn't have a direct book to pull from but I'm still so worried they would destroy certain parts of canon. Hannibal is a complex character and often people are unwilling to give him that complexity

I was brought to this subreddit by /u/Faustyna 's post in the AskReddit thread about TV shows and he/she said this:

&gt;Takes place before Hannibal Lecter's capture, and the Hannibal book.

which was probably supposed to be exciting but to me it just smacked of opportunities to mess up canon and ""fix what isn't broken.""

So I'm wondering

I mean

Edited again to add:

More sidebar.

&gt;psychiatrist-turned-serial-killer

Wrong way 'round

It's these things that I'm afraid of/asking about.

Abigail and Hannibal - Unless she is saved by someone unexpectedly it is pretty clear Abigail is going to die (it's been pretty clear from the start really

Will and Hannibal - I think that Will is getting close to realizing what Hannibal really is and all of the things that he has missed

Alana and Will - I think that whatever goes down is going to be really intense

Season 2

Hannibal - I was curious to see if they would ""out"" Hannibal this season which I think they will not. I think Hannibal will be able to use Abigail to cover his tracks but because this wasn't his original plan this will put him on edge and the juggling will be a big story line for Hannibal next season. But I also think we will see much more of a chess match almost between Jack and Hannibal as Jack circles ever closer to the truth.

Will - I think the entire story line with Abigail will shake Will to his core and cause him to question his process entirely. I think he will continue to pursue something with Alana but because she has a bit of fear when it comes to him and what he is capable of it will force him to come to terms with the fact that he must embrace his abilities in order to be free of the weight of them. I think this will be his running theme for season 2. 

Jack - It's pretty clear that Jack is going to be the one to catch Hannibal but I think what we are going to see is that despite not really understanding what Will does he will have to identify with Will and use those tools to catch Hannibal. In many ways Jack will have to become Will in order to catch Hannibal

Dr. Du Maurier - I think she is going to cross paths with Will at some point.

The episode begins in Minnesota. It is very still. A police officer enters the house

Opening credits.

Will, before she is replaced by Garrett Jacob Hobbs and, finally, Hannibal. SWAT storm Will's house--apart from his dogs, it is empty.

The BAU team, back in Virginia. Alana is with him.

Will has gone to Hannibal's house, beginning to rave. In his ravings, however, he starts to put together the pieces and realizes that Hannibal has the same connections to the copycat killings that he has. He accuses Hannibal. For his part, Hannibal argues that Will has committed the murders in his periods of lost time (the same theory he gave Jack), and that accusing someone else is a defense mechanism.

Jack has reasoned that if Will is not at home

During the conversation, and the two begin to fight, destroying Hannibal's dining room and kitchen in much the same way Tobias destroyed his office.

Will knocks Hannibal down and grabs a knife. He raises it high to stab him and Hannibal reflexively shields his face with his left hand. The blade cuts deep into his palm.

Jack's SWAT team rush in with their guns drawn. Hannibal is between Will and the door so they do not shoot, the world spinning.

Jack reads Will the murders he is charged with, holding his left hand in his right. Both his hands are covered in blood.

The pendulum swings once and the season ends.

Coming in season 2:

* Hannibal
* Will is committed to the same mental hospital as Abigail. She joins Garrett Jacob Hobbs in haunting his dreams.
* Jack checks Will out of the hospital like a library book.
* Freddie Lounds
* With Will committed, continues killing.

So I've watched through episode 8 and I have some theories that I would like to discuss.

Potential SPOILERS BELOW (I tried the spoiler text format and it didn't seem to work for me. Sorry.)

I think Will might be killing people as he's losing chunks of time. It would kind of fit with his hypnosis style pendulum style of assessing a crime scene and would also seem to fit how he's always right. Is Hannibal controlling him through drugs and hypnosis as well as other forms of manipulation.
I think Jack might end up being fed Bella. Hannibal has made several comments regarding his keen sense of smell and that he knew someone had stomach cancer before he was diagnosed. He also commented Bella's perfume and let's assume he knows she has cancer and it seems he's been feeding all his guests people all along. Seems likely that somehow Bella's cancer and Hannibal will cross and him eating or feeding her to someone else seems as if it would have a 'holy shit' factor for viewers and it seems twisted enough for a season finale type thing.
*Will at some point has to end up being a killer. His mind is slipping
