**Origin of the main characters:**

After his work on the Mewtwo project, while biologically human, lacked human emotion. Professor Oak made a second attempt using a 475 nanometer laser. This produced a more refined, more ""human"" subject who could easily be mistaken for a perfectly ordinary and rambunctious young boy. The first subject was implanted in a surrogate mother living in the town of Pallet, while the second subject matured entirely in Oak's laboratory. The subjects were named ""Red"" and ""Blue"" after the colors of the lasers used in their creation. Postpartum, the surrogate requested to raise subject Red. Professor Oak obliged, and chose to raise subject ""Blue"" as his own grandson.

**How Pokeballs work:**

A Pokeball leaks radiation proportional to the mass of the Pokemon contained within, the radiation of those balls adds up, so most people are only capable of carrying three or four Pokeballs at a time, if that many. Gym leaders, being in a static location, don't have to carry their Pokemon on their person, and not being in constant close proximity to their Pokeballs, being genetically engineered superhumans

**""Leveling up""**

When Pokemon participate in battle, Pokemon exude large amounts of radiation.  Their adrenal response also leaves them susceptible to radiation exuded by opposing Pokemon during combat.  This radiation causes Pokemon to mutate, and the extent of these mutations is proportional to the strength of the opponent.  Face a terrifyingly-strong opponent, and high radiation levels and increased susceptibility will lead to rampant mutations.  Weaker foes, conversely, will have little impact on a Pokemon's physique.

These mutations cumulatively add to a Pokemon's strength, allowing it to use the move Vine Whip.  Other times, the mutation is more drastic, causing a Pokemon to mutate into an entirely new form.  (Also known as evolution)

Although ""leveling up"" is the usual way for Pokemon to evolve or learn new skills

**What is the Pokemon League?**

The Kanto region is controlled by four elite emperors,"" surrounded by loyal followers/apprentices. The Elite Four is aware of the possibility of a trainer raising Pokemon even more powerful than their own. To prevent such an individual from attempting to stage a violent revolution, the Elite Four has extended a generous offer: anyone who is able to beat them is allowed to join their ranks. Many trainers dream of becoming rulers of the world, but few possess the skill needed to make it even past the first few gyms.

**The Epilogue:**

After conquering the Elite Four, he was horribly unfit for the role of leader. Red became known as a despot, inspiring the hatred of all of Kanto. Under his leadership, the skills of the Elite Four atrophied. Red was blind to the rumblings of rebellion throughout Kanto, but was not blind to the fact that his skills as a trainer were growing dull. To rectify this, he planned a hiatus during which he could train alone on Mount Silver.

At the time that the Elite Four's skills were atrophying, and when Red left for Mount Silver, the Kanto Gym leaders staged a rebellion. Lorelei and Agatha were either killed or fled into hiding. Bruno, being among the more benevolent rulers of the Elite Four, was allowed to stay. The Kanto gym leaders were not able to defeat Lance's powerful dragons, but after seeing Agatha and Lorelei disappear/get killed, Lance admitted that he had no desire to see the current system continue. The Kanto gym leaders allowed Lance to stay as league champion, Koga, meanwhile

More speculation in response to [this tidbit](http://i.imgur.com/jVf56.png):

The Mewtwo project was an attempt at creating a doomsday weapon to end the war. Lt. Surge's words suggest that the war was fought primarily with Pokemon

This is why everyone in Red and Blue's world has Pokemon, ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and train Pokemon shall not be infringed."")

The war was fought between Kanto and Johto. In the events of the gen 1 games, this relationship changes, and people are given more freedom to travel between Kanto and Johto.  Johto has substantial infrastructure that obviously didn't just spring up in the three years between RBY and GSC; many areas of Johto seem to have a rich cultural heritage (Mahogany comes to mind).  However, people in Kanto seem to be relatively ignorant of the land to the west in gen 1, largely due to the rift caused by the war between the two regions.  By the time gen 2 rolls around, everyone in Kanto freely acknowledges their neighbors in Johto, with scientists like Bill traveling freely between the two regions.

Mewtwo succeeded in ending the war, Bark Town was largely obliterated by the Mewtwo disaster, and it wasn't until years later that ""New Bark Town"" was founded on its remains.  Both sides of the conflict suffered heavy casualties and were forced to unite in order to subdue Mewtwo, putting an end to their conflict.

---------

**Other musings and topics for discussion:**

* Daisy, Daisy was the result of one of his earlier experiments, Daisy was the daughter of a researcher who died when working on the Mewtwo project...
* How does the Pokemon storage system work? Possible explanation: it is possible to convert Pokemon entirely into data that can be stored electronically and retrieved later, making it possible for Pokemon to pop in and out of them at the blink of an eye.
* For the entire game, and he reaches the Elite Four first. I think that he also beats Red to each of the Gyms. (His name, if I recall correctly, is always posted on the ""list of winners at this gym"" that Red sees whenever he walks into a Gym.) This brings up many questions, such as: how did Blue manage to get to Fuchsia before Red if he didn't have the Pokeflute? Moreover, how did he get all of the HMs he needed to do things like Surf to Cinnabar?
* It seems to be common etiquette that in any Pokemon battle between two trainers, as Red loses 50% of his money whenever he loses a battle, and there's also a trainer (a Cue Ball on the biker's path west of Celadon) who says something like ""Be ready to fork over cash when you lose!""
* Schools are an interesting point. In all of first gen, suggesting the possibility that education might be limited to the privileged and wealthy.  On the other hand, in gen 2 Johto seems to have more trainers which attend school (there is a new trainer class called ""schoolboy""), consistent with the general trend that Johto seems to have better-developed social infrastructure than Kanto.
* The world of Pokemon is absolutely littered with random items. Even areas that are relatively far off the beaten path (like the Seafoam Islands and Unknown Dungeon) have items. In fact, having had little exposure to humans. When/if all of his Pokemon faint, the feral Pokemon kill and feast upon the defenseless trainer. Eventually, their remains decay, leaving only a collection of items behind. These items become strewn about over time.",high quality,False,t5_2tpgv,True

1334885902.0,siv71,"Thoughts on the ""Kanto War"": a means for victory.",T0mb0,508,67,78,"
This idea is based around the ‘poke-kanto war’ conception

Guns and bombs appear nowhere in the game. Users and poke-conspirators alike assume the war used pokemon and humans to fight. I propose a widespread weapon determined the outcome of the war: chemical warfare.  Chemical warfare won the war

Land plants are often the first organisms affected in a contaminated area, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Oddish, Gloom, Vileplume, Bellsprout, Victreebel. The only grass types in the Kanto region that are not poison are Exeggcute, and Tangela. 

Poisonous plants/Pokemon then affects the surrounding animals during consumption: Bug types. Weedle, Venonat, Venomoth. Up the food chain, creatures consuming the contaminated bugs are affected. Wind carries chemical and poisonous compounds through the air. IRL, Bats consume massive quantities of bugs. (The reason repel exists in the game) The poison/flying type: Zubat and Golbat.

Poison does not stay in one area because rain water carries compounds away. The contaminated run off eventually floods into the ocean and affects the biosphere there. The most abundant pokemon encountered on water: Tentacool

The pokemon killed by the chemical warfare carries the poison even after death: Ghastly

Pokemon types naturally resistant to poison became augmented by the chemical warfare. Rhydon, is affected by the poison. Rhydon altered into Nidoking &amp; Nidoqueen, also known as Drill pokemon, share the same egg group, are all artistically similar to each other, and their prior evolutions are only found in the safari zone.

Nidoking and Nidoqueen exchange their rock/ground into ground/poison and those offspring lose the ground type as a result of the poison contamination.  Nidoking and Nidoqueen do not occur naturally in the Kanto region. An additional moonstone is necessary to evolve Nidorino and Nidorina and reintroduce the ground type back. Nidoran are small enough to escape the safari zone and roam route 22.

Further chemical warfare evidence:
Koffing and Weezing are pure poison types artistically styled after landmines.
Muk and Grimer are living sludge. Sentient sludge that thrives off of polluted factory waste. A by-product of the creation of the chemical weapons.
The Indigo plateau, the same color of poison!!

After all the information is put in, and either: 

a)summons the new trainer to his lab to give him his pokemon if the trainer lives in the same town

b) the professor pay the new trainer a visit if he's not in the professor's town

There was a time when Oak was a young trainer, one that was all alone and asleep in a soft pile of uprooted grass. The Pokémon had clearly not eaten for a few days, so Oak set food upon the ground in front of the little fellow. The Pokémon ate it instantly, and glared at Oak. Without a second thought, Oak quickly captures the small pokémon to bring him home and nurture him. Oak runs home to his room, and immediately lets his new friend out of the pokeball, and meets him officially for the first time. This is what he says:


""Hi there! Welcome to the world of people! My name is Oak! Others call me the Pokémon Kid! This world is inhabited by creatures called humans, new friend?""


Puzzled, scared at first, but sees the innocence and happiness on Oak's young face. The Pokémon crawls into Oak's lap and looks at him. Soon enough, Oak holds the small creature like a child and sings him a lullaby. The Pokémon is fast asleep.


In the following days, Oak fills an entire journal on his friend as well as an illustration of himself and the Pokémon together.


""Book one complete!"" he says


Oak and Friend venture through the forest, Oak and Friend make a record of every other pokémon they interact with, eventually dedicating an entire journal to drawings of each pokémon they met along the way.


More years pass, Oak sees that his old apricorn is good enough for Friend to reside in, and lets him have his way. Tired from a hard days work capturing three unique pokémon, Oak sits at his desk, Friend in his lap, and sings a lullaby. Friend is fast asleep.


Many more years come and go, he's evolving!


Now larger, while Oak hums a lullaby.


A new family is in town, but his Mother tells them he is too young for now.


Four years pass, sitting behind the Laboratory, watching the bird pokémon that they had discovered fly overhead. Oak looks at Friend and sees a very solemn look in his eye, a sort of accomplished look that only an old man such as himself might have. Friend then looks at Oak, distinguished, but aged, and Oak immediately knows what this means.


Once more, and sits at his desk with Friend on his lap. Oak holds Friend like a child, and looks him in the eyes. With his arms cradling Friend, Oak begins to sing a lullaby, more lovingly than he had ever done before. He rocks Friend back and forth despite the size of him, then Friend's gaze begins to fade, his eyes close, for the last time.


Tears swell up in Oak's eyes and roll down his face, as if he were the young friend he met all those years ago. In a choked voice, Oak whispers in Friend's ear:


""You will always be my Friend.""


Oak receives a telephone call from his grandson, telling them what has happened and they inform him to bring Friend there, in his original pokeball. Oak returns Friend to the old apricorn, and begins his walk to the center. However, on his way there he sees a young boy about to run into the tall grass! It's the young boy from years ago! Quickly, Oak stops him, explaining that he needs a Pokémon as a friend to protect him. Oak drags the boy, to his laboratory and lets him choose one of the pokémon that he and Friend had caught previously. Oak's grandson barges in and witnesses the boy choosing first. Oak's grandson chooses the other, and in a way his grandson Blue does too. Waking from his daydream


""That's no problem sir, I wish we could have helped.""


""There's nothing that could have been done


Oak returns to the laboratory looking over all of the documents that he and Friend had compiled

""Ah! This is the custom Pokéball I ordered. Thank you very much for bringing this Red!""

Oak turns and places the parcel on his desk, the word ""Friend"" was engraved with a capital F. He knew that the nurse at the center had done it just as a show of respect, but the coincidence was fated. The stone apricorn was beautifully crafted and the sight of it made Oak tear up once more. He looks again at his Pokémon Dex, and back at all of his research.


""This is what he would have wanted.""


Wiping the tears from his face


""This is a high-tech encyclopedia called the PokéDex. I'm getting old, take these with you.""


After the two leave, he lost the one thing that mattered most to him. As he looks around the room, remembering the time he and Friend had spent together, Oak's eyes fall upon the last remaining pokemon on the table.


Picking up the pokeball, and very happy. The pokemon looks up in anticipation as Oak crouches down to its level. Before Oak can even bring himself to sit down, the creature leaps into his lap, causing Oak to stumble slightly backward, now sitting on the floor. The pokemon nestles itself on Oak's warm lap. Oak cradles the pokemon in his arms, and says:


""You remind me of a very close Friend of mine.""


Hugging him close to his chest

**Pikachu is Ash’s father.**

This is obviously just for fun

**The Story:**

Ash’s father was a friend of Professor Oak’s in Pallet Town, leaving his own body either dead and empty or replaced by the Pikachu’s essence, which would make him seem crazed and/or deranged. Oak panicked and because of his close relationship with Delia (his student’s wife), he hid the body (in either state) and claimed that Ash’s father had gone off to “continue his adventure as a Trainer” and then hid away the Pikachu in shame or fear. However, as he knew Ash when he was a [child himself] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/M04), Oak knows that Ash will eventually have a Pikachu and decides to give him the one from the failed experiment. Whether Oak knows the identity of Ash’s Pikachu as his father is irrelevant. Either way, he wound up giving the Pikachu to Ash because he knows that Ash will own a Pikachu in the future.
 
Once released from the Pokeball, as his family still loves him. Here, we can argue that Delia may know the true identity of Ash’s Pikachu. If she (as a student and friend of Oak’s) also knew about the experiment, she may have her guesses as to why the Pikachu is so special and where her husband really went. If this is the case, she decided to let Ash start his Pokemon journey despite her motherly fears because she knows he is in good hands with his father. 
 
Because he has a human’s soul and knowledge
 
**The ""Proof"":**
 
* In Latin America, Pikachu is the result of an experiment conducted by Professor Oak and allegedly destroyed the lab where he was created in a momentary loss of control. 
* Delia knew Spencer Hale
* Pikachu and Delia are fond of each other and Pikachu gives her more attention than Ash or his other Pokemon at many of their reunions. Also
* According to [Bulbapedia] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ash%27s_Pikachu)
* Unlike most of Ash’s other Pokemon, as seen in [Pikachu’s Vacation] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/PK01) while the others simply want to battle.
* Pikachu has a particular dislike of Team Rocket’s Meowth as seen [here] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxuDaC5Nvkg). He deliberately wants to cause him and Jessie and James harm
* Ash and Pikachu have very similar personalities – eager to fight and test themselves against others
* Pikachu is incredibly loyal to Ash and even decides to keep traveling with him instead of staying with other Pikachu in [Pikachu’s Goodbye] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP039)
* Pikachu does not want to evolve. Because of the radical physical changes that take place in Pokemon (as well as possible mental ones
* Pikachu has an odd fondness for ketchup
* **EDIT** Pikachu is the first to cry (even before Ash's human friends) in the first Pokemon movie when Ash is turned to stone and ""dies"" (as suggested by TheSystemer).
* **EDIT** Other characters in the Pokeverse have been transformed into Pokemon

Logically, Gary gets to pick his Pokemon first. It's later revealed that he chose Squirtle, which, of course, is weak against the Pikachu Ash winds up with.

What does this mean? Well, Gary is the one who represents the player. Gary is always besting Ash at everything because, as the ""player,"" he is almost guaranteed to succeed. Meanwhile, Ash is constantly struggling with the basic concepts of Pokemon battles. Sure, he does all right and he tries quite hard (and even shows improvement through the first few seasons), but, he can never really come out on top.

This mainly only applies until Gary chooses to become a Pokemon researcher because

This is a very brief thought, etc. I know Ash doesn't exactly fail at *everything* since he's the one that the anime follows, but since the general consensus is that he's pretty bad, I figure it holds some water, at least.

**I'm using the term protagonist very loosely here. Think of it more as ""character that most represents the player character from the games

**EDIT:** After some discussion

First, the writers could have chosen to give Gary any starter (or none, really), but they opted for him to start with Squirtle without any obvious driving factors (Blue has Charmander in the manga, so there isn't even that).

Second, emotionally-invested player who cares more about exploring the world and playing with his favourites than going for the quick win; Gary represents the more calculating player who looks at stats, type match-ups, etc. in order to ensure a quick, easy victory. Something like casual versus tournament players.

**EDIT 2:** It's been brought up a few times that Ash didn't get to see which Pokemon Gary chose and, this makes it seem more like it was a writer choice that something that occurred ""in-universe."" There's discussion about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/u7z7m/gary_is_the_protagonist_ash_is_his_rival/c4t6m18) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/u7z7m/gary_is_the_protagonist_ash_is_his_rival/c4t6ljr).

1376505743.0,1kd5l5,Ash's Age Explained,maxsnow,339,49,38,"So I've been doing some thinking about Ash and his supposed agelessness
The first thing to point out is that Ash actually does appear a little taller in the new X/Y series, including the specials there are roughly around 803 episodes and 16 movies following Ash's journey. The important thing to pay attention to though is that most of the episodes all take place over the course of a single day, sometimes two, with no indication of time passing between episodes. In fact there are a quite a few cases where multiple episodes all occur with the same day (namely league battles, gym battles, arcs dealing with legendaries, etc.), which translates to about 2 years
Now Ash began his journey at exactly 10 years, making him almost 11 at that time (Also fun fact I found that since it's said trainers get their Pokemon in April of their 10th year, assuming that Ash began on April 1st, that would make his birthday November 21.) This would mean that in the the Black and White anime series, Ash would be no older than 13 going on 14, a prime age for many young men to experience there growth spurts, hence his new height in X/Y, as an Article in the magazine PASH! estimates N to be about 20 years old and is 5'11"". Naturally a still developing 13 year old would appear dwarfed next to a fully grown man of 20.
Let's also take note of the voice actor change a few years ago, when the special Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon first aired (In America first no less), and Ash's voice actor changed becoming slightly deeper, he would have been traveling for about one year at this point making him about 12, the perfect age for someone's voice to crack.
Now as a bit of a side thing, Ash naturally would not know everything about it just because he's used one. I own a cat but that doesn't mean I know about its digestive track. Ash is still young and has been taking in a lot of new information at a break neck speed through his travels, so it makes perfect sense that he would on occasion need a refresher on how things work even if he's used it in the past. Besides Dexter already told us he wasn't the brightest back in episode one.
So that's that, his voice changing, facial changes the idea of Ash not aging is not true in the least, the problem was people were attributing his age to our time progression and not the time of his world..... Also I just realized that I went out of my way to research the age of an anime character for no reason.... wow.",Specific People,False,,False,t3_1kd5l5

1342816964.0,ww4v9,"Why most in-game trainers have less than 6 Pokémon, and why being a trainer would be a risky business. ",Wolvenfire86,330,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/ww4v9/why_most_ingame_trainers_have_less_than_6_pokémon/

We discussed this for a good hour

First of all, take care of it, train it a little, but if they were all real people, they have to get money and pay bills just like everyone else. Most in habitants of the Pokémon world like Pokémon but are probably not interested in getting badges or collecting a lot of living breathing animals and teaching them to control their awesome powers.

Next, all while not having a steady income. You make money by channeling other trainers, so if you lose a battle you may lose the means to eat that week. Losing money in a battle also means losing money to buy Pokéballs, so the option to get more Pokémon vanishes if you lose too often.

And if you don’t have someone give you a starter, what is stopping the Beedrill from attacking Joey next (if it were all real)? Now imagine this same trainer trying to catch an Ekans or a Nidorino? If this was real, catching wild Pokémon may be incredibly risky and this probably deters a lot of people from entering the league.

Then there is traveling. Pokémon trainers walk a lot because that’s where the Pokémon are; back-roads, etc. Traveling is expensive and time consuming, and leaving home is stressful enough without having to worry about weather, the dangerous conditions of sleeping outside, getting robbed by Rockets or whoever else, and wild Pokémon. It is safer to stay close to home and catch the Pokémon in your backyard, which is probably why some trainers have three Geodudes or two Tentacools. And again, so it’s probably hard for the average wage slave to buy some Pokéballs

But worst of all…there is no promise you will succeed in your career. In the game, but you have to fork over your hard earned money every time you lose a battle. That’s how trainers make their living. There are probably many, many trainers who dreamed of being the champion but fell short of that goal. Maybe that is why you can encounter a Pokéfan playing with their kid and they have a level 40 Yanma. Level 40 is exactly how far they got before they couldn’t go on.

So we concluded that being a trainer is a hard as hell profession

I love my friends.

So, hatched Arceus. I’ll explain later how the egg got there. Arceus is in a void, Chaos basically. From the Chaos, Arceus created Dialga, Ruler of Time, Palkia, Ruler of Space, Ruler of Antimatter. Giratina was sent to an alternate dimension, is creating other Pokemon. Mew is the first “official” one. Mew can, Arceus created Lati@s



Deoxys’s DNA, Arceus had created Groudon and Kyogre, to create land and seas. They did so, but could not be contained; their power was too great. Arceus brought Rayquaza forth, to have the ability to calm them. Arceus and Rayquaza sent Groudon and Kyogre into deep sleeps, hoping that they would never be unleashed upon the world again. The Sky Pillar was built for Rayquaza to keep the weather in the Hoenn region safe. Meanwhile, Arceus created Regigigas, it was sent into a deep sleep in the northern most reaches of the Sinnoh region.



Back to Deoxys and Mew. They created hundreds of Pokemon. But what was the first one? Heatran. It’s the only legendary that can be either male or female. This is because Deoxys and Mew were experimenting with DNA. After seeing Heatran’s incredible power, they shouldn't breed; one legendary in the world is “bad” enough. Pokemon are sent out from them all over the world. But the problem is not many are surviving. The world is barren, and bleak, as no life has grown from Groudon’s rocks it created. So Shaymin is born from Arceus. It brings life to the world. This gives the Pokemon an area to thrive. But, only certain Pokemon were equipped to handle certain areas. This is why only some Pokemon are found in some regions compared to all of them.



As more Pokemon are being created, and a Jynx (don’t ask how). This resulted in a baby human. Unexpected, but brought forth into the world. Humans began to live alongside Pokemon, but not as Trainers (at first). They saw themselves equal in the Pokemons eyes. Some humans began to use tools, and soon cities and structures came to be. Arceus, seeing Man had now stepped out from the Pokemon line that they came from, gave them the 3 Regis, and learn more about the Pokemon they came from. Man did so



The land was flourishing, we know this to be the case, but when? The Unown, not a true legendary, was given in part to Man from Arceus, in an attempt to better communicate between Man and Pokemon. Unfortunately, Man created its own alphabet, but not similar enough for Pokemon to recognize. Arceus sent the Unown to the realm of Giratina, but it crosses over sometimes. Those crossing overs occur in the Tanoby Ruins, to grant the wish of either a Man



Back to the story of Man. As Man is evolving, as we know, and is upgraded even more. The second time Man messes with technology and Pokemon is hundreds of years later, with Apricorns. The first “Pokeballs” were created from different forms of the Apricorn berry, found exclusive to the Johto region. Soon, Unova began to develop technology to mass produce these Pokeballs, becoming the region of extreme growth and wealth. They began to make synthetic forms of the Apricorns, and tried to make a huge price for the Pokeballs, resulting in the fighting that tore them apart. Kyurem was to reunite them at one point



Quick side note: During the growth of Man and Pokemon, Thundurus, and Landorus, to create weather for the world. However, Tornadus and Thundurus had “free-reign”, so to speak, and brought havoc on the Pokemon world. Landorus, punished them, Mew and Deoxys created Cresselia for the full moon and Darkrai for the new moon. Unfortunately



Now, sometimes Man overstepped their bounds on the land of Pokemon. To prevent Man from fully ridding the world of the natural habitat, Arceus created the Swords of Justice: Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion. They protected wild Pokemon, but where they lived was attacked by Man. More on this in a second.



Man messed with technology and Pokemon a third time. This resulted in the Pokemon War. How did this start? This has been long debated, and attacked them.  Sensing trouble, Mew and Deoxys created Keldeo. There wasn’t enough time to get Keldeo fully grown like the rest of the trio, so Mew and Deoxys super-charged Keldeo, and it saved the Swords before they died. This action resulted in the beginning of the Pokemon War. Pokemon fought against Man constantly, some getting captured and being forced to battle against their comrades. Kanto was the hardest hit in the war. Man had bases in Victory Road, the Power Plant, wanting to get Man out of these areas, remained there, the resting place of Lugia. Ho-oh accidentally attacked it



The war isn't over yet, having it use its song to calm the world from the war. This great sacrifice causes the war to end, but has it lost its song forever, only remembered in the minds of the people. Almost all legendaries go to sleep, save a few, like Ho-oh, to wander the world, who is journeying the world to see what it has created



A boy is born. He doesn't know much before he becomes a Trainer, and creates Mewtwo, about 5 years before Red becomes of age to be a Pokemon Trainer. Mewtwo escapes, and hides in Cerulean Cave, where only the strongest Trainers dare to go. In attempts to recreate Mew and a safer form of Mewtwo, scientists keep playing with Mew’s DNA, and end up creating Ditto instead. This is about 3 years before Red is a Trainer. Once Red is of age, but keeps searching for greater challenges. He captures all the legendary birds



In this self-induced reclusion, a Pokemon powerful enough to keep people with “bad intentions” from reaching those intentions. Victini is close by when Gold battles Red, just in case Red does win, and become the most powerful Trainer ever. Victini is there to kill Red, if needed, but we know that doesn't happen.



So, and Arceus knows this. In the closing moments of the world, not having the power to stop the end of everything, Arceus creates two things: an egg, containing itself, and Celebi. Celebi is the time traveler, and in the last moments of the world, to let the cycle begin once again. Celebi then goes back to different points in the future



TL;DR: There’s literally no way to sum this all up quickly, and found Deoxys. Deoxys and Mew created almost all Pokemon, save a couple legendaries. Groudon and Kyogre created the Earth, and Shaymin created the life for the Earth. Pokemon flourished, and through a cross-breed of Mr. Mime and Jynx, Man was created. The Unown were the link between Man and Pokemon, via a written language, which crosses over into the Pokemon world where the Unown can be found in the games (also the reason why the ruins “never run out” of Unown). Man creates superstitions of the moon, first established in the Johto region. Unova creates a near monopoly of Pokeballs, minus Keldeo

1365616761.0,1c2s4d,A farfetch'd theory,canadizzle,311,39,25,"Allow me to start by stating some pokedex entries:



EP049: ""Farfetch'd, Farfetch'd is nearly extinct. ""



Yellow: ""Lives where reedy plants grow. They are rarely seen



Red/Blue: ""The sprig of green onions it holds is its weapon. It is used much like a metal sword. ""



BW/B2W2: ""It can't live without the stalk it holds. That's why it defends the stalk from attackers with its life""




Although it is generally accepted that the anime is not cannon


My theory is this: Farfetch'd is one of the first pokemon that was hunted for human consumption.  It's quite obviously stated in EP049 that they we hunted until near extinction, most hunters will hunt for 2 reasons: 1) for practical purposes - putting food on the table, and 2) the thrill of the hunt, or ""hunting for game"".  Farfetch'd is appealing to both of these reasons to hunt because 1) it comes with a leek, which is an added bonus because you can use it when cooking, eliminating the need to go shopping for this delicious ingredient. And 2) as stated in the Red/Blue pokedex entry, Farfetch'd will use its leek as a weapon - which is appealing to people looking for a challenge who hunt for thrills.  The BW/B2W2 pokedex entries ARE NOT meant to imply that Farfetch'd will die without its stalk (the analogy being ""charmander will die when its flame goes out""), hints at the implications should a Farfetch'd lose it.  This, as it no longer has any means to protect itself from hunters.

**Technological Information:**

-Technology is as diverse and inconsistent at the current time due to the continued recovery of areas and their relative level of participation in the Japanese-United States war.  Some townships were cooperative and relatively prospered, and are left in their states similar to how they were before the United States occupation.

-Travel is reduced due to the nearly universal removal of overland transportation technology.  The removal was partially due to the societal collapse of Japan and also encouraged to reduce environmental damage

-Infection Containment Devices (ICDs) were distributed in the Japanese regions post-war.  The specific technologies used are governmental secrets of the United States, such as teaching skills and location transfers at proper governmentally monitored stations.  While the construction is strictly monitored by the government, homebrews have been concocted and distributed in some areas.


**Cultural Information:**

-Japan is still steeped in the myths and legends created during the time of initial rebuilding

-Japan has a fluid and varied language regarding infected and technology related to such individuals developed during the generation after the collapse of formal society.  They continue their tradition of alternative labels as an aspect of their cultural identity.

If you watch the Special Features on Mewtwo Returns, Fuji had a family. He had a wife and a ~6 year old daughter. His daughter died in a car accident. Fuji used his research on cloning to try and clone his daughter, who's name was Amber. His attempts to clone Amber became an obsession. He spent days and nights in his basement monitering the progress. He became so obsessed that his wife eventually left him. He was alone. No daughter, no wife. His whole family, gone.

These five clones, in their early stages, could communicate with eachother supposedly via telepathy. They eventually grew close and became good friends. During his cloning, Mewtwo had friends and behaved like a normal young boy.

However, and as AmberTwo faded, *Mewtwo cried*. AmberTwo said to Mewtwo that her father used to tell her a bedtime story that, when a Pokemon cries, its tears are full of life. This legend is proven at the end of the first movie, when all of the Pokemon revive Ash with their tears. Pokemon tears are, in fact

This is why Mewtwo is the only succesful clone. Because he cried. AmberTwo's death caused him to cry. His tears were full of life, the fossil he was cloned from. Mewtwo's own tears brought him to life.

The other clones didn't cry. Mewtwo's tears essentially brought him to life. Mewtwo then killed Fuji (As far as we know),False,,t5_2tpgv,1344744704.0,,,t3_wnsaa

I'm a Biology major student and I feel that the whole world of Pokemon is a little vague. The mysteries of Pokeballs and the wonders of nurse Joy. But the biggest mystery was of the Pokemon themselves, perhaps I shall add them later on with ""exclusive features"". Anyway; here's Charmander!

**Reproduction:** Charmander has a very strange way of reproducing. Clearly there are no external reproductive organs, at this point it is dropped off the tail and the egg is ready.

**Other Species Breeding:**

* Male - It is difficult for a male Charmander to breed among other species, the daycare is truly a conspiracy.
* Female - A female Charmander merely requires the sperm of another male species to land on her tail to initiate pregnancy.

**Growth:** Charmander is born with tiny arms and legs creating a serpent-like appearance, and within a few weeks Charmander is around the average height of 0.6m and 8.5kg, at this point Charmander can be considered level 1.

**Nutrition:** Charmander is an omnivore, it has been noted that female Charmander may actually ""eat"" flames in order to keep it's flame at a comfortable temperature for the egg.

**Natural Moveset:** As a Charmander gains levels it learns new moves:

* Scratch/growl: Are the only moves known but a young Charmander as it has not yet mastered the use of it's flames.
* Ember: Charmander is able to draw some of the flames off his tail into a holding organ
* Smokescreen: Charmander allows the flames in his Flame Sac to smolder. By doing so
* Dragon Rage: Charmander is able to heat up flames to a high temperature in his Flame Sac. The intense heat increases the power of his ember, and the flame begins to eat itself up after an amount of time. Inflicting a certain amount of damage and putting out any possible flames.
* Scary Face: As Charmander becomes more mature, ""lowering their speed"".
* Fire Fang: Charmander has gained more control over his fire and may now; coat the inside of his mouth (and in particular his teeth) with flames
* Flame Burst: Charmander is able to shoot a fireball out of his mouth. Upon contact this fireball explodes
* Slash: Charmander's claws have hardened to the point where he can inflict critical damage.
* Flamethrower: Charmander has finally mastered the ability to fire a continuous stream of fire
* Fire Spin: Charmander combines the finesse of a Fire Burst with the continuity of the flamethrower. Charmander is able to breath continuous flames as well as molding them into a spinning tunnel of flame. Lighting everything nearby on fire.
* Inferno: Exactly what it sounds like. Charmander unleases an Inferno upon his opponent.

**Evolution:** After 16 levels the flame on Charmander's tail has grown big enough for him to evolve into a Charmeleon. The flame on Charmander's tail, into a dark red. The flames trigger heat sensitive growth genes, quickly enlarging his arms and legs, creating more pronounced claws. A crest forms on the top of his head. During this process, a Charmander may feel intense pain, this may be the cause for the potential, bad-temper of a common Charmeleon.

**Ability:**
* Blaze: As Charmander becomes weaker, through sheer will power, a weakened Charmander is able to activate the Blaze ability and increase the size of his flame, in turn increasing his fire attacks.

* Solar Power: In intense sunlight the flame on Charmander's tail begins to grow, and it quickly spreads along Charmander's body, potentially inflicting intense pain.

Over the generations the colours seem to have gone into higher ""values"" first just red and blue, constantly increasing in ""value"", but the 5th generation gave us two basic colours, Black and White. However, these colours are not so basic, and the games reflect that in many ways.

First and probably the most prevailant in these games is Ideology. Evil orginizations in the past have always just been out for their own selfish goals. Rocket wanted money and power, for the first time, Plasma fought for something they believed in, equality and freedom of pokemon. Now yes, the argument can be made that this was a ruse by Ghestis for his own means, but no one knew this BUT him, everyone joined and followed Ghestis because they believed in what he said. It brings to light (at least in the games) the actual cruelty of trapping animals and releasing them to fight each other. Now pokemon is a different universe, but there are always bad trainers who abuse their pokemon or activly seek to harm others (such as the other eveil Teams). Team Plasma is the only organization that provides a valid argument to justify their actions, just as Team Plasma does.

Now, we got 2 games that were direct sequals to Black and White. Many of us expected a Grey version, but instead we got two new storylines that expand on what happened in the first games. Why not a Grey version? My theory is that we never got a real answer to ""is battling pokemon humane?"" out of the first game, and they need to expand more on the question. N left at the end of Black/White to seek his own answers, and despite being able to talk to pokemon AND the evils that Ghestis displayed, he still has no answer. In B/W2 there are even two team Plasmas: those who reformed and those who push more for domination and forced release of pokemon. Even their outfits match the game colours, one is prodominatly black while the other is mostly white

Gamefreak needed a whole sequal to refrase their question, there are two sides to the argument and thus Black vs White will continue (well, maybe not a B/W3 but it just shows there is no end).",high quality,False,,t5_2tpgv,quality,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/12nju6/why_this_generation_of_games_are_black_and_white/

Celebi exists because Arceus created him and the other legendaries (non legendaries are descended from Mew). Because Celebi was created by Arceus he was able to take the Arceus egg back in time to the origin of existence. But who created that egg? Arceus created it

So lets look at it this way. Arceus creates all of the legendaries and the egg from which he would sprout, Arceus too brought himself into existence.

1341708002.0,w794f,Missingno.'s origins,MrMoneymad,193,28,61,"Missingno. is one of the most bizzare

It's well known that Cinnabar Island (the place where Missingno. can be encountered) contains a burnt-out lab, experiments used to take place. We don't really know what happened there, but there seems to be a link with Mew; in Mewtwo's pokedex entry, it says that Mewtwo was 'created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments.' 
Given that this took years of 'horrific' experiments

Enter Missingno.

During a particularly catastrophic attempt to create Mewtwo/clone Mew, shape-shifting mess of DNA (perhaps its ability to appear in several different forms- such as a skeleton Kabuto or Ghost- could be explained by the fact that it has a primitive ability to transform; a skill which Mew is able to carry out flawlessly and thus the scientist attempted to copy), and Missingno. was born. Horrified by the monstrosity he had created, and desperate to keep it a secret, the scientist removed Missingno. and drove it out into the sea. The confused monstrosity of a creature, with nowhere to go, simply lurks around Cinnabar Island, and with little understanding of its surroundings.

The scientist, and the diary entries are merely lies, invented for the purpose of covering up the true nature of Mewtwo's creation, and the deformed failures (most notably Missingno.) that were created in the process.

Missingno. does share some similarities with Mew/Mewtwo: it does not appear to the ordinary bystander
The moves which it has learned can be explained by its surroundings- Missingno., has learned moves by observing. As people constantly fly to and from Cinnabar (something of a landmark, given that it contains a high-ranking gym and laboratory), Missingno. imitates the flying pokemon, and thus knows Sky Attack. As it seems to float around the shore of Cinnabar, it has obviously been exposed to many water-type pokemon, and, has learned Water Gun.

Missingno. also seems to have an ability to distort its surroundings- when caught, turning it into a confused mess. Moreover, the Pokemon Mansion where Missingno. was created is full of Mew statues- perhaps Missingno. has transformed objects into these in its ongoing attempts to mimic Mew. 

And what of the scientist himself?

The fact that Missingno. sometimes appears as a Kabutops skeleton, the scientist worked on other things simultaneously and had other instruments with him; interested in fossils, he had many lying around while conducting his work. When created, Missingno. noticed and attempted to copy some of the things that it saw besides Mew- having noticed the skeletons, Missingno. occasionally attempts to morph (more successfully) into copies of these.

Once successful in creating Mewtwo, the scientist turned his attention to another project of his- the reanimation of fossils.
Yes
As previously mentioned, and his powers of communication are somewhat diminished.

Missingno. continues to warp and distort its surroundings- the player can also encounter other stupidly overpowered pokemon (such as Level 134 Golducks or Hypnos- the latter of which cannot even survive in such conditions) around the area in which Missingno. lurks when performing the glitch that causes it to appear. Indeed, the player's own sprite and those of their pokemon begin to warp and become scrambled- due to their constant exposure to Missingno.'s presence. 

Could Missingno. have subsequently created other glitch pokemon in the game? Or were they other failed experiments

Think about this. When you were a kid, you did your kid things all day, came home for dinner, and then continued. But if one of your parents would mention the word ""video game"" or ""bucket full of candy"" you'd be all over it. And that would often be the subjects grown ups would use to connect with you.

And people talk to you about what connects with a ten-year old best. And that's Pokemans in this case.

Editional thoughts: Another points indicating to how the world is being shaped through the players eyes is the lack of more serious themes that would excist in the world. No trace of politics or world issues, though. Maybe the most popular example is Lt. Surge. It is hinted that he fought in a war, maybe with pokemon. The point is that these issues are present, but too heavy to bear through a child's eyes. For a kid it's too early to accept that these serious themes are a part of the world.

Due to the nature of a number of Pokedex entries a number of friends of mine have agreed with me that the speed stat actually refers to a pokemon's ability to accelerate here's why

1. Dex entry Pidgeot- It spreads its beautiful wings wide to frighten its enemies. It can fly at Mach 2 speed.

2. Dex entry Dodrio- When Doduo evolves into this odd breed

3. Now lets compare the base speed stats Pidgeot's is 91 whereas Dodrio's is 100. Speed is most commonly given a unit of m/s, so I thought what if this refers to the acceleration instead? That's when things started to make significantly more sense, lets think of a pokemon battle. 

One trainer sends out a Pidgeot, Pidgeot faints the battle is over. Assuming that both pokemon are released from their pokeballs at approximately the same time these pokemon should be considered at a stand still effectively meaning that their speed (m/s) is actually 0. So in terms of physics
v=at + V0(original velocity)

Thus the pokemon with the higher ""speed"" or acceleration stat hits first.

While pokemon trainers can't do much with these four pokemon

- Zubat and Ratatta for **warfare**. 

Rats have historically been used as disease vectors during sieges and recently as suicide bombs. It's possible these used to be a pestilence used by an enemy which has recently been brought under control. Alternatively, for example.

Zubat is incredibly useful because it learns supersonic and leech life very early on. Packs of bats could be used to harass and confuse enemy troops. Bright lights worked on zubats however

- Pidgey as **transportation**.

An easy to breed bird that can carry supplies to troops. Its evolutions can carry wounded human from battle as well as heavier medical supplies and weapons. Now that the war is over

1)  Since the entries are blank before catching the pokemon, is the most likely source of this data.  Since you are essentially Ash, it makes sense that most entries seem like the ramblings of a kid hyped up on pixie sticks at 3 in the morning during his first sleepover - Ash is, after all, an idiot.  

2)  If the information isn't coming from the protagonist, I find myself asking a question:  why are scientists (and/or their creations) coming up with lines as coherent as that of a contestant on ""Kids say the darnedest things?""

Let's run with number 2

So couple this idea

* ""We found this egg with your pokemon!  We have no idea how it got there.""  Even after seeing 8000 of them.
* The plans of every villainous team in the pokeverse - ""we're gonna take over the world using nothing but raticates and golbats"" was *by far* the most competent plan in any edition thus far.

To me

This also explains how we

Why?  Because by living alongside pokemon in a cooperative manner humans have never felt any evolutionary pressure to develop more intellectually than they already did.

The only piece of the puzzle that isn't rock solid is the prevalence of truly remarkable technology - pokeballs, palaces erupting from underground, interaction with other universes.

1356402083.0,15ehyg,Why Machamp Evolves via Trade,Domriso,182,36,64,"This is a question that popped up via my previous theory on the existence of the Alakazam as a culture separate from humans. While I've thought on the issue before

As I do with all my theories, such as the manga or anime. 

My first piece of evidence is that of Machop. Machop is fairly small, it does put into perspective the incredible strength a Machop likely possesses.

Furthermore, due primarily to lack of evidence, I assume that this is an exaggeration, but it does bring up some interesting ideas. To a 10-year old, especially one which has not practiced martial arts to any real degree (as is likely for most young trainers), any fighting moves that Machop practice probably come across as martial arts-like. In fact, one could argue that perhaps the many different fighting-type moves that Machop learns resemble techniques from other pokemon-world fighting styles (who better to learn from than a pokemon concentrated around fighting?).

Next, in fact, that a belt must be used to contain its power. Presumably this is something that protects itself more than the rest of the populace; I imagine that if it used its full power it would likely end up killing itself. 

In any case, this is almost represented by the fact that it learns moves later, meaning it gains greater amounts of stat increases between learning moves, but I digress). Even its arms possess rips, showing off the newly formed muscles, uncontrollable beneath its skin. This change between the philosophy of Machoke and Machop is something to be noted.

Finally, my theory comes from the pokedex entries. Machamp has ""mastered many martial arts styles"" and ""can throw other pokemon over mountains."" Once again, hyperbole, exaggeration, &amp;c, &amp;c, but the interesting thing to note is one particular word: mastered.

While Machop and Machoke are being trained by a single trainer, its entire basis of combat is changed. It gains a new trainer, likely gains new companions, and receives an entirely new view on life. This inextricably alters its mind and ethos, leading to the evolution into Machamp.

Note, more ""set in its ways"" Machoke that the epiphany can take place.

Further, the change from Machoke to Machamp is drastic. Machamp has four arms; Machoke has two. Machamp is nearly 300 pounds; Machoke is just over 150. Machamp has a huge torso compared to its waist; Machoke is much more proportionate. Machamp has only two toes, its feet set up to be constantly primed; Machoke is more like a human, with five toes. Machamp has no rips on its arms; Machoke has massive gaping tears on its arms, and even Machop has what appears to be stretch marks on its chest. 

In other words, once again, it could destroy itself by using its true power, much like how a human who uses the entire power of their muscles would crush their bones.

**In Conclusion...**
Machamp evolves via trading because it has reached a physical and mental epiphany

**As an aside...**
This didn't really fit into my analysis as is, Machop and co. know exactly how to get around any defense, befitting them as the masterful fighting pokemon.",,False,,t5_2tpgv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/15ehyg/why_machamp_evolves_via_trade/

Suddenly he saw a bright light flicker and rise up over a mountain some distance away. It surprised him, so he wondered if this could be an undiscovered Pokemon species. And as it came into clear view, it mesmerised him.

It was an enormous bird of more than describable size and beauty. Its wings glistened and blazed with embers

Then, and proceeded to glide down the mountain. The young man watched as embers scattered from its wings... and he noticed that they all fell in a particular way. 

When they finally all landed, but it was too late; all that he saw was that bright light slowly fading behind the mountain from which it had come. The man smiled in thanks, and set off back down the mountain.

As he was making the journey back to his hometown, and he barely knew anything about it. However, he deduced from the scattering of embers from its wings that it must have been a fire type. He decided that he would honour this Pokemon that saved him, not only by choosing to focus on raising Fire-type Pokemon over others, but to attempt to genetically recreate a Pokemon like this one at his hometown research centre.

The man's name was Blaine.

This project of genetic engineering took him many years. Over the course of these years, Blaine decided to move his personal research away from the Mansion so he did not get distracted from it, but he had nowhere. Fortunately, Fuji favoured him and supported his research, and decided to help him along. Fuji founded the Pokemon Lab, as a separate research entity to the Mansion, which Blaine could work in. Blaine was very thankful to Fuji and they stayed on good terms for a long time.

A few more years passed, and one day, testing on a pair of simple bug Pokemon, one male &amp; one female, he struck gold. What he produced were two not-fully-evolved bug Pokemon with the genetic code of the majestic bird's wing embers fused with their own. He was ecstatic, but soon realised that these Pokemon would have to be kept a secret; if they were anywhere near as strong as his saviour had seemed, it would be very dangerous to expose them to the people of the island. Having become not only a master of Fire-type Pokemon Trainer over the course of his life, riddles and disguise

He built a small laboratory for the growing of the Pokemon deep inside the long-dormant volcano on Cinnabar Island - the two bugs loved the heat and cosiness of the place, he established a Pokemon Gym on the island, the first they had ever had there.

He continued to run the Gym and nurture the Pokemon for several more years. The two bugs grew shockingly quickly; they began to become more powerful and intelligent than any Pokemon that Blaine had ever seen. Eventually, the majestic firebird, they were able to fly, and spread embers and fiery scales with every flap of their wings. Blaine decided to christen the two bugs' species Volcarona, after their place of raising and their fiery abilities, and the larva form Larvesta. He secretly wrote up their existence on the database of his fellow Pokemon researcher Oak's latest invention, the Pokedex.

One thing he wanted to find out was whether or not the two Pokemon could breed; they were of the opposite sex and had a pre-evolution form, success came; the female Volcarona became pregnant with an egg.

Blaine began to relax his focus and care towards the Pokemon, this didn't stop him losing to a pair of trainers in quick succession, one called Blue, and one called Red, who went on to both become champions of the Kanto Pokemon League.

Meanwhile, while the male recognised that Blaine was trying to protect them and everyone in the outside world from their uncontrollable power, and had to keep stopping the female from plotting to escape. 

A year or so passed... until suddenly the female snapped and began to fight with the male. A battle of epic proportions broke out between them inside the volcano... and their fires were so powerful

The people of Cinnabar noticed the eruption and panicked. the island was fairly small and they were not sure if they would be able to save everybody in the town in time.

The two Volcarona fought a devastating battle, weakened by her burden of the egg, the female could not fight on, and instead flew away as fast as its wings would carry it. It needed to fly of to a place far away, where the male would never be able to find it and finally defeat it. It flew across many a sea, past Kanto, Johto, until it finally reached the faraway region of Unova...

Meanwhile the male Volcarona, bright enough to burst through the volcanic ash and allowing the people to gather their friends and family and escape. To most of the people, the bright light was just the sun blasting through the dark ash, but one man who had been on the island for many years recognised it for what it really was.

The man's name was Blaine. The way in which his own creation was saving the lives of his fellow Cinnabarians, and made him feel complete.

When the island had been fully evacuated, and followed the ember trail to the very deepest room in the ruins. It burst in, wings and embers bristling, but what it saw stopped it in its tracks.

The female lay there whimpering, and as the last bit of life seeped out of her, she finally gave birth to their egg. On her dead body, he vowed that he would find their egg a safe home, and would never venture out into the world after that, for he was too powerful and would only cause more destruction and sorrow.

He left the ruins with the egg, picturesque, beautiful route full of aquatic life, cliffside grass habitats and a single trainer camp atop the tallest cliff. He sensed that those who ventured here would only be those with a pure and brave heart. He left the egg outside the camp house, said one last tearful goodbye, and returned to the ruins.

Once he reached the room in which his partner had died, and vowing to never leave the place as penance to her and the rest of the world, hoping that she may look to him from the spirit world and forgive him.

A blond-haired Pokemon Ranger was returning to the camp that he and his friends had set up on Route 18, tinted with the colours of flame and emeralds, left on the doorstep. Puzzled, he and his friends decided to take the egg in, and give it to any trainer who came to the camp that thought they may have the ability to raise this mysterious egg......

* You have the uncanny ability to run for as long as you like without tiring out. In addition to this

* You are able to carry tremendous weights, countless potions, sprays and Pokéballs around the region like your character does.

* To top it all off, or even reaching high altitudes by flying on a Pokémon. Visiting winter towns or volcanoes is no problem either, since you do not appear to feel the effects of temperature change.

You can probably see where this is going. When they realized Pokemon and People could live harmoniously, your friend. So they made schools to educate people, funded research labs like Professor Oak's. And, to make sure everyone was constantly catching Pokemon and constantly training them, they built Gyms to encourage competition, and PokeCentres free of charge to aid Trainers in their quest.

I have been playing through a lot of my old games recently... FireRed here and there

Each region... Takes things in their own stride if you notice... Kanto seems kind of

Johto is more upbeat, training Pokemon, trying to be a new Champion, and the whole place feels slightly more harmonious. 

Then we get to Hoenn, or the whole essence of the game feeling more, well, natural. The Pokemon are all slightly more like realistic things or forces of nature, and the land is spread out and economized less. Even the one route with a bike path was trying to stay peaceful for nature. Nothing feels extremely out of place aside from the Weather Institute. 

Sinnoh seemed to be more focused on the past

Continuing on, overdone. 

It seems we've come into the time of glutton and prosperity in the Pokemon world. Unova's people are all carefree it seems, gorging themselves on easy wealth. As a trainer, you can rack up over 1,000,000 easily in that game. You can become a star, everything is meant to be so freaking BIG.

And it makes me begin to wonder... Is this kind of like the progressions of economies before another big war, who was a veteran...

Johto is when life begins to pick back up

Hoenn, and they are also slightly disconnected from the rest.

And Sinnoh is an older community that chooses to live in their ancestry

And we get to Unova. Unova reminds me a bit too much of the Roaring Twenties. They are all extravagant, bigger than the other regions by a longshot, and like America was during the wars, not really close or attached to the people who were involved with it. 

So, but it's what I am seeing.

1355889271.0,1539lv,The Alakazami Exist as a Separate Culture,Domriso,156,26,67,"This is a theory I formed quite a while back, only found in a few human-controlled areas. The few Kadabra and Alakazam found in human control are by psychics

Now

**Abra** - One of the only reasons that the Alakazami are seen at all is because of the life-cycle of the Abra. Nearly unable to protect themselves, it will teleport away whenever it senses danger. It is thus very rare.

But, it is telepathic, and it does eventually evolve into Kadabra... but how?

The telepathy is the key. Even in the games,"" though the connection is transient. This slowly accumulates into life experience as it draws upon the memories and thoughts of the different creatures it meets. Finally, upon achieving enough of this exposure, the Abra evolves into that of Kadabra, a much more advanced form.

**Kadabra** - Kadabra is special. It is found in only three locations in the games; Route 8, and even in those locations they are barely found. 

In fact, the Kadabra essentially set up scouts, looking to make contact and, if hostile, dispose of the otherwise incredible psychic creature.

The Kadabra represent the major participants of the Alakazami culture. Having gotten past the larval stage of experience-at-a-distance, telekinesis, precognition, and other useful powers. They also separate themselves almost completely from the human-controlled lands. 

The question becomes why? Why stay separate? I have only conjecture at this point

Furthermore, that Kadabra and Alakazam are sentient. Even if the pokedex entries are exaggerations, the fact is that even children recognize that Alakazam are vastly intellectually superior to most humans. In fact, the only humans that seem to have Kadabra or Alakazam in their parties are (to my knowledge) Psychics, humans who would understand and have empathy for another sentient creature (or possess the will to attempt control over the psychic being). 

In other words

**Alakazam** - Alakazam offer up the final point of my argument. Found literally nowhere in the games (can only be obtained through evolution or trading), they are one of the few pokemon which evolve by trade, and this is something of import.

I have always assumed that pokemon which evolve via trade must have something important about them changed through the process. Onix and Scizor fuse with their metal coat, however, the change is something of an akashic field; the two pokemon are being officially changed between two trainers, and becoming ""property"" of the other, and forming a new bond. When you take into account the fact that Kadabra apparently only remain with trainers they respect, the only Kadabra which are traded must be between two individuals who have both earned its respect. It is forming a very durable, important bond with multiple individuals

Further (as noted by Doc0281)

Notably, and this makes sense in Alakazam's case, since it would merely need to form a deep mental and emotional bond with multiple individuals (""merely"" here being something of a tongue-in-cheek reference).

**In Conclusion...**

1356814752.0,15n15f,Unova is able to live in extreme wealth and extravagance at the exploitation of the other regions,overthink1,151,23,40,"As many users before me have pointed out

First let's look at regions other than Unova, yes, but the cities don't expand, and no new developments are made. In fact, it gets even smaller because Cinnabar Island was destroyed. This, AN ISLAND CITY, couldn't even afford the necessary evacuation equipment. There weren't ANY boats at all. It's fully possible that everyone on the island died. More than that, when a single part is stolen from the power plant

Then there's Johto, this is only a natural product of its colonial relationship with Unova. The city does in fact have sea access even if we see no boats in the games, so Goldenrod likely became the home and hub of middleman traders from Unova. This makes sense, as Goldenrod, even in its name, has similarities to the extravagance seen in Unova.

Third on the list we have Hoenn. Most likely it operates similarly to how the Hawaiian Islands were for the US. It provides tropical resources, mall, and hotels: it's a place for the rich of Unova to vacation. Further supporting this tropical island theory are towns like Pacifidlog and Lavaridge, which are of little interest to foreigners and are therefore left undeveloped. Hoenn has two major port cities, Lilycove (as previously mentioned) and Slateport, with boats that can travel to those two cities or out of the region. But what about transport to other cities within the region? It's nonexistent. It doesn't benefit the Unovans to build intra-regional transport, so it's not going to happen

Lastly, supporting the energy need in Unova. As a reward it has been provided with enough resources to remain stable. The majority of the population is happy to maintain the status quo as long as their cherished history is preserved. But we still see hints of negative influences from Unova in Sunyshore City. It is my assumption that the gym leader there, Volkner, was originally from Unova, because unlike most of the other people of Sinnoh, he has no interest in its history and isn't content to simply be with his Pokemon. He tries to find pleasure in the old extravagant ways of his homeland: technology, advancements, he conducts such huge renovations on Sunyshore City that he causes a huge power outage that takes weeks to correct.

And so we come to Unova itself. Like the generation one and two games, over the course of three years, Kanto has more or less remained stagnant and even lost a city. Unova, however, has experienced huge growth, creating four new cities and expanding old ones. Think about the path between Virbank and Castelia. You simply take a boat. No other region had enough resources for that. You would have to surf. Furthermore, Unova is the only region capable of affording a competent police squad. (They arrest Team Plasma members in the Liberty Garden.) 

Of course, which are simply being hit by hard times. So, what do we see in terms of resource production in Unova?

In Mistralton City

That is literally all Unova does to supply for itself. The only logical possibility is that they are exploiting other regions in order to maintain their high standard of living.

**Growth:** ""Abras are born from an egg after spending a long period inside their mother. (about 5-7 months) This egg is significantly small to accommodate the female abras smaller... yea. &gt;//&gt; When born the abra's head is about the size of its body. it is about 7-13 inches tall.

How do they decide what types will be represented as gyms in a region? Why do you sometimes battle a Gym Leader and they have a team of two basic Pokemon

Here are some answers:

The 8 gyms in a region that you visit in the games are not the only gyms. There are others
The reason your character only collects 8 is because that is the minimum requirement to enter the respective Leagues. 

Also, which for the player character is the 8th gym, but for them would be the 1st. In that case, the Gym Leader reserves the right to use a team that is at an appropriate difficulty for the trainer. It wouldn't be fair for Wallace/Juan to use their 5-man fully-evolved Water-type team on a rookie trainer. They probably would use a much simpler team for the Sootopolis trainer to get their first badge. Then for example that Sootopolis trainer's 8th badge can be Lavaridge, and in that scenario, Flannery wouldn't use her Slugma-Torkoal team like she does for the player, but rather something more advanced

This right to reserve their strongest teams for tougher trainers would also explain why the Gym Leaders in BW2 all have ludicrously strong teams compared to the ones you see in their gyms.

1352139760.0,12og5k,The Biology of Pokemon: Pikachu,bluedonkey100,166,45,37,"Pichu/Pikachu

**Reproduction:** Pikachu reproduction is very similar to that of a common field mouse. The penetration of the penis into the vagina, though it looks significantly different than the adult Pikachu.
Due to this difference, Pichu however; could theoretically stay a baby it's entire life.  The change from Pichu to Pikachu will be discussed in the evolution section.

**Growth:** The baby is born small, and black around the edges, as well as well developed ears and a small tail.  There are a few reasons for the classification between Pichu and Pikachu.  Pichu only reaches about 0.3m, which is slightly shorter than Pikachu (0.4m), and 2.0kg, Pikachu is 6.0kg.  Though the differences between Pichu and Pikachu in terms of height and weight are not quite enough to warrant a separation.  The main difference is that Pichu cannot reproduce.  No baby form of any Pokemon can reproduce, however; Pichu remains a baby for significantly longer periods than most other babies.

**Nutrition:** Nothing special here

**Pichu's Natural Moveset:**

* Thundershock - Pichus are born with the ability to discharge electricity from their cheeks (in fact it is necessary for the Pichu to discharge often in order to prevent a build up).  Because they are babies

* Charm - Being a baby Pokemon

* Tail Whip - A Pichu can distract opponent's by waving it's tail around.

* Thunder Wave - A Pichu is able to send out a circular shock wave.  This wave has very little shock value

* Sweet Kiss - Would you be confused if this little mouse shocked you with a bolt of electricity

* Nasty Plot - Behind that cute visage

**Pikachu's Natural Moveset:**

* Growl - A young Pikachu can growl at opponents along with a slight discharge of lightning from the cheeks
* Quick Attack - Pikachu has lost most of it's ""baby fat"" and is able to move at extremely quick speeds

* Electro Ball - Pikachu generates a large amount of electricity in its cheeks and begins to mold it into the form of a ball.  Due to a lack of maturity, the faster the opponent, the less power Pikachu is able to deliver the attack with. 
(This one is kind of tough to explain

* Double Team - Another gift of Pikachu's speed

* Slam - Pikachu trades some of his speed for more power

* ThunderBolt - Pikachu's ThunderBolt is a very direct strike of lightning.  Electro Ball utilizes power and molding, forgoing molding (which increases the concentration of the attack). 

* Feint - Pikachu uses his speed to get around another Pokemon's ""protect or detect"" and strike at a weak point using a quick body check.

* Agility - Pikachu is able to boosts his speed to incredible heights.

* Discharge - Pikachu is able to unleash a huge amount of electricity.  This attack utilizes only power

* Light Screen - Pikachu is able to mold it's electricity into a force field of sorts

* Thunder - Pikachu is finally able to use the three abilities together.  Molding

**Pikachu Evolution:** Upon gaining enough ""happiness"" Pichu is able to evolve.  In the wild, it is given by the trainer.  Once Pichu has gained enough happiness, a special hormone protein (dubbed evolvatase) in it's brain is released.  Evolvatase removes a particular inhibitory protein (dubbed evoinhibatase) in Pichu's body that was causing a sort of negative feedback that inhibited further growth and evolution.  Without this hindrance, Pichu is able to grow once again.  Not many changes are included, however; Pikachu does grow to a larger size as well as growing more yellow fur to cover some of the black fur of Pichu.

Special thanks again to Daanieljabugan for putting the correct words in my mouth.

**Raichu Evolution:**  Upon evolution, and completely burning out the fur in the center (creating the white colour).  This electricity stimulates the nervous system, creating a quick growth; including the tail which grows to be much skinnier and longer.  This is what causes Raichu to take on his characteristic form.

**Abilities:**

* Static - Pikachu/Pichu is discharging electricity at all times in the hopes of preventing a build-up.  Thus when physical contact is made

* Lightning Rod - Pikachu/Pichu's constant discharge of electricity attracts other electrical attacks, as their electricity disrupts the attack.

1371464122.0,1giaim,The Mysterious Absol- The 4th Legendary Beast?,JARRYMAN,134,15,65,"**Absol Theory**

*Hypothesis:* Absol is related to Entei

*History of the three legendary beasts*
150 years before the events of Gold, Ho-Oh returned to the tower and revived the three Pokémon. These Pokémon are known as the three legendary beasts Raikou, Entei and Suicune.  

*The Mysterious Absol*
Absol is first introduced in Generation III (Ruby, he is followed by natural disasters such as earthquakes or tidal waves. This leads Absol and his origin to be shrouded in mystery. 
The history of Absol is not clear

*History of Absol*
Absol was introduced in Gen III as a native from the Hoenn region. If we follow the ‘Contemporary History’ of the Pokémon universe
 
*Similarities*
Upon first look, Entei to be a lion, and Suicune being either a leopard or cat like feline. With this in mind, we can conclude that these Pokémon may be related due to their looks alone. However there is more proof that they could be related.
The legendary beasts are all in charge of an element or realm that causes natural disasters; this is shown in their species type. Raikou, which in turn leads to tornado’s and alike. Entei has the power of volcanoes, this in itself is a natural disaster, but in order for volcano’s to happen seismic activity must be present. This leads us to believe that Raikou also has power of earthquakes. Finally,Suicune, the aurora Pokémon. Aurora being water, verified by the fact it is also a water type
Absol is known as the disaster Pokémon

*Theory 1*
Absol was created with the purpose to oppose the three legendary beasts Raikou

The theory suggests that Absol opposes the three legendary beasts. This is done through Absol warning the victims of the natural disasters ahead of time. Unfortunately for Absol it often takes the blame for these disasters

The reason Absol doesn’t resort to physical aggression to stop these disasters from happening is it knows that the legendary beasts are stronger than it. This is obvious by the clear height and weight difference between them. 

There are two possible way’s in which this theory can pan-out.
1.	Absol was created at the same time as the legendary beasts by Ho-oh. However Absol saw the damage that the disasters caused the innocent people and left their ranks. Now Absol spends their time warning people about the oncoming disasters.
2.	Lugia created Absol to counteract Ho-oh’s creations. This would make sense

*Theory 2*
Absol was created the work hand in hand with the legendary beasts. This theory has two main tangents to it.
1.	The Absol species were created at the same time as the Legendary Beasts to be their messengers. This can be easily described as a resemblance to Angels delivering messages of destruction to areas or villagers. This idea is reinforced by the fact Absol can live up to 100 years old.
2.	Absol was created at the beginning of time as a small species; later on they were adopted by Ho-oh to work for his latest creations
Conclusion
By now it is clear that Absol is somehow related to Raikou

My conclusion as the author of this idea would be theory 1.2
However this is only what I think

The End.

http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/129k4h/trubbish/

To paraphrase /u/Smartio: Trubbish is essentially a grimer that has taken refuge in a full trash bag as a way to stay moist and has subsequently integrated the trash into its body. When the once-grimer reaches the stage that it would evolve into the much larger muk


I really like this theory


Now, but this all works without that, by just accepting that ditto came from mew in some fashion.


In my opinion it all boils down to this: grimer are polluted ditto and the three inorganic poison lines are basically different forms of the same line.

So here it goes...

Ditto are morphically unstable, can shift endlessly into an equally endless number of forms, but not if they are exposed to certain man-made toxins. Much like the mutations caused in fish, frogs, birds, etc in our own world as a result of pollution, ditto is likewise affected. After long exposure to these toxins and pollutants, known as a grimer. However, has become a breeding population of grimer which perpetuates itself in the unending stream of pollution and waste created by humans.

Now, it has even more trash. So much so that it has begun piling up in landfills. The local grimer population has (as stated by /u/Smartio) taken to inhabiting the garbage found in the dumps in an effort to keep themselves moist. The grimer which reside in the sewers of Unova have a constantly damp environment and so remain grimers, having no reason to fear desiccation. Just like grimers, trubbish and garbadors can produce more of themselves, rather than reverting to grimers (presumably there must be unused garbage bags nearby).

The koffing line, it thickens and becomes not unlike hard rubber. It continues to produce toxic gases (which grimer is documented as doing), but without a liquid exterior theses gases build up inside until eventually this pre-koffing achieves liftoff and becomes a full-fledged koffing. Following the same lifecycle as grimer (since it is essentially still a grimer), the koffing eventually reaches the point where it would typically expand into a muk, but given its new bouyant, rubbery nature it expands differently. Almost like a hernia, the weakest section(s) of the koffing's walls expand outward, branching sections of ""bubbles"" and becoming a weezing. Now, weezings are necessarily loosely defined and can be formed in analternate way than described above. Two koffings may stick together and eventually form a functioning weezing. Likewise

TL;DR: http://i.imgur.com/yoaRc.jpg

**EDIT:** It has been brought to my attention that the Pokemon mansion not only supports this theory, be the ""ground zero"" for it all.

It is generally accepted that ditto are essentially failed mew clones created when scientists attempted to clone mew. The final results of their experiments, but also destroys lab equipment. It is not hard to imagine that certain toxic chemicals, used in either the cloning process or other experiments being carried out in the mansion, are released into the environment where the dittos can come into contact with them. 

After the abandonment of the mansion, grimers in the water and koffing floating on the ocean winds, and both without the need to really eat anything. Once this initial population made landfall on the Kanto mainland, it would have taken them no time at all to adapt to the abundance of waste and pollution created by people. And since they would be filling a niche that had never existed up until that point, and given their toxic nature, there would be nothing to check their growth or spread.

And that's why you find ditto in the lower

Trapinch (ant pokémon): *in some cultures

* Got it now? Maybe the pokédex, beliefs and scientific description all together. Your player travels the world collecting extra data that he learns from the locals, the places he visits. 

In BW before catching the Musketeer trio, he's an old man passing down the trio's tale. There's also a city where all the people go home at night because they are afraid of a pokémon that comes out of a hole at night, maybe one day that will be the said poké's pokédex entry. Not to mention the Zoroark event that disguises himself as a woman and as one of the legendary trio dogs. Imagine that this Zoroark that disguised himself as a woman event got famous and turned into a popular tale, then one day a trainer hears the tale and register it in his pokédex ""it is said that Zoroark disguises himself as humans so it can live better"", looks legit right? Maybe one day, a single kid got lost because of a single Hypno, and now everybody thinks they kidnap children, that are registered in the pokédex.


**AND**


 That explains why a world-renowed poké professor like prof. Oak gave pokédex to some kids, the little things, besides the science part he himself researched. 

* He's a pokémon professor god damn it, in the original games, the code for a fight with prof.Oak was still in the game, and he was the highest lv trainer in RBG, stronger than the champion. I think the professor title prof.Oak have is way more important than Champion, don't you guys think? Why prof.Oak knows so much about pokémon?

The Mr. Mime and Jynx origin delves even deeper into the human psyche

---

The Theory:

* The original Mr. Mime and Jynx are the lovechilds of a human who did the dirty with a ditto.

Note: I eratta'd the theory to include the phrase ""The original"" because of the fact that they can be bred to produce more offspring of the same species.

---

Supporting Evidence:

* Colour scheme: If you look at the pre-evolutions of these pokemon

* Body structure: Both of these pokemon take on humanoid forms.  If you look at the pre-evolutions you might say that they should have some human-like traits. The pre-evolutions have 'hair' on top of their head and are bipedal - much like human offspring.  (Okay

* Special abilities: In mating with a human, these powers are why we categorize Mr. Mime and Jynx as pokemon, and not human.  If Mr. Mime and Jynx were categorized as human, this would essentially open an ethical can of worms (humans that quite clearly have special abilities, blah blah).  We already know that in the pokemon universe, young kids are taught to capture pokemon and make them fight against eachother.  In the real world, this would amount to cock/dog fights - 'activities' that are deemed unethical.  So we have established that in the pokemon universe, backing up the notion that Mr. Mime and Jynx can be categorized as pokemon and not human

* More on origins:  In generation 1, and only a few other trainers had them.  I theorize that the gen 1 Mr. Mimes and Jynx's would have been the first 'batch' of human/ditto babies.  In some later generations, some games only allowed you to obtain these pokemon through trading.  Other games would allow you to obtain these pokemon through breeding.  Some games had the appearance of these pokemon in the wild, and for these, I theorize that they exist as a result of some trainers releasing their Mr. Mimes/Jynx's to the wild, and having these pokemon produce offspring of their own.

---

The darker side of Mr. Mime's origin:

* Gender: Introductory genetics will teach you that a human father can pass on either an X or a Y chromosome to his offspring.  Passing on an X chromosome will lead to a baby girl, it is quite reasonable that Mr. Mimes are found in ratios of 50% male and 50% female, provided that the mother ditto provided an X chromosome.  This leads to my theory that the original Mr. Mime was conceived by a **human male** and a ditto.  If a ditto transformed into human form by copying this human male's DNA, the ditto would be able to pass on either X or Y chromosome. As stated before, if both partners passed on Y chromosomes, the offspring would not be viable.  However, any other combination would lead to a viable offspring.

* Implication: In gen 1, who embraced their lovechild.

* Moveset: Mr. Mime's moveset builds off of the guilty conscince from his father.  The overall theme is that the father regretted his decision, reflect, safeguard.  Pretty self explanatory (lol).  Some of Mr. Mime's other moves speak to the father's personality: double-slap (he was probably abusive, backed up by the fact that he traded away his son), encore (he probably did the dirty more than once), trick (for all we know, the ditto could have been coerced into doing the dirty!). Other moves, many questions left unanswered

---

The darker side of Jynx's origin:

* Gender: Introductory genetics will teach you that a human mother can only pass on an X chromosome to her offspring.  Jynx is always found as a female.  Why? Because the original parents were a **female human** and a ditto.  When the ditto transforms to human form for the purpose of breeding, leading to every offspring in this interaction to have XX chromosomes - (it's a girl).

* Implication: See the Mr. Mime explanation.  Same story

1340612589.0,vkb76,The Newest Theories,Domriso,139,23,67,"I've been lurking about here for a while, and I disagree with quite a few of them. Having felt like this subreddit edified me quite a bit

A few notes before I begin: I take only the core games (RBY, DDP, BW) as canon. There are far too many discrepancies between the many mediums to use more than one of them, and I find the games the most interesting. I'm still not sure if the Ranger games contradict anything from the core games, so I leave them out of consideration for now. 

Further, done my best to do so. Please, if you see a discrepancy bring it up; I'd like to further my theories by having more information.

That said

**1) The Mew Hypothesis**
Everyone's heard the usual theory on Mew. A creature that learns any move, created Mewtwo when it was cloned, &amp;c, &amp;c. What never fails to amaze me about this, however, is the fact that, from all the evidence present

Mew has DNA from every single pokemon. Got it. I could see how people who don't know anything about evolutionary theory might think that this means all pokemon must come from it, mutations occur, natural selection leads to new creatures. A creature further down the evolutionary line might have a genetic structure resembling the previous, but it will be morphed, changed, and, most important of all, plus some.* The previous creature

So, which possesses all of the genes of all other pokemon, came first? If anything, it should have come last, being some kind of bizarre genetic experiment. Or, another possibility that I have described before, that Mew is a genetic thief

In short: the idea that Mew is the origin of all pokemon is complete and utterly wrong

**2) The Pokedex Issue**
This one actually has been detailed, it's obvious that the pokedex entries are not 100% accurate. That said, if the obviously false ones are ignored while the ones that seem plausible are taken to be true, and the iffy ones assumed true, but made note that they could be wrong, you come to a rather sad realization: the pokemon world is full of near magic, and technology is amazing. 

...Okay, extreme metamorphosis, biomolecular technology, energy to matter converters, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The pokemon universe is weird.

In short: I support the idea that much of the pokedex entries are hearsay or hyperbole

**3) The Nature of Evolution in the Pokemon Realm**
Now, not the gradual process of genetic shift) seems very prevalent, but not completely everywhere? And how some Evolutions seem weird (some pokemon need to be happy, some pokemon need to beat other pokemon up, some just seem to be based on time, &amp;c.)? This is my theory.

The pokemon genome is highly mutable, Magnemite, anything using a stone), but some somehow Evolve when presented with created objects (like Magmar and Electabuzz). Why is it that technological objects, natural objects, radiation and the like, can have such effects? I think it's literally that pokemon can actively change based on connections with other things. Hell, Voltorb

Furthermore, Evolution in the pokemon world seems to change a pokemon in a huge way, altering them in ways that just don't seem natural. Even Team Galactic has an interest in the power contained within an Evolution. 

**4) Why People Fight**
This one is sort of my counter theory to the Kanto War theory. While I think the War Theory is interesting, and the world just generally doesn't seem to bear the right problems for a war to have been fought. 

My contention is that people fight because

First evidence: even young children fight, and many are young). But, ten years old is practically ancient compared to others. You can literally go into a playground and beat up preschoolers in Black and White, and they even partake of tournaments! It's insane!

Second evidence: the safest places to travel are in cities and towns. Pokemon swarm through any areas that aren't actively patrolled; even the routes between cities are packed full of wild, their routes being even more dangerous than normal. If those are the places normally traveled, then how dangerous are the completely unpopulated areas? Probably pretty frickin' scary.

With these things in mind, turning the naturally occurring training into a competition, because that helps to build up a better reason for people to travel, and to better prepare people for more fights. 

Certainly

**5) How People Control Pokemon**
First off,"" as is implied many times in the games. If the many different villainous teams aren't examples enough of mistreating pokemon, there's always the rival in Gold and Silver who quite obviously abuses his pokemon, and yet they obey just as well as normal. 

This seems to imply that there is some kind of control exerted over the pokemon by humans. Some have said that there is nanochips or other technology in the pokeballs, and it's well known that pokeballs, as they exist now, are a recent development. Even though apricot balls existed back then, the technology for using mind control seems to have been years ahead.

So

Here's my reasoning: One, allowing them to make them obey. But, using this control on multiple pokemon is difficult, and completely outside the bounds of most people. So, in the past, most people only had a single pokemon, their pokemon, whom can fight with two pokemon at once, the triple battles are actually just single battles with a weird format of switching. It's not three pokemon truly at once. And,"" and only a few people do it; probably because it's incredibly stressful. 

As a sort of side evidence for the fact that humans have psychic abilities, but they are rather rare. Then again, we have Mewtwo, who was supposedly a clone created by mixing human DNA with Mew's (and, if Mew has all DNA, why would that matter?), and then Mewtwo comes out being basically the most powerful Psychic pokemon there is. Sure, but Mew also learned all techniques. Mewtwo was not nearly so adaptive

**6) The Pokemon Universe and You**
Now

The short argument, but an Earth that has been extremely altered due to a string of bizarre metaphysical and metatemporal events which altered the timeline in a kind of crumpled mess. 

....Just stay with me here.

*Evidence A:* Celebi. With just Celebi, that time travel can alter the basic nature of a pokemon, since a Pichu that time traveled with Celebi loses its ability to Evolve. We could also take the idea that there was time travel technology in Gold and Silver, but seeing as that is never referenced again from that point, I'm content to just assume it was only a way to try to allow trading between the two generations and just leave it at that. We still have Celebi, which travels through time, and knowledge that time travel can alter living creatures.

*Evidence B:* The Real World. There are multiple mentions of real world places throughout the pokemon games

&gt; Aerodactyl is a Pokémon from the age of dinosaurs. It was regenerated from genetic material extracted from amber. It is imagined to have been the king of the skies in ancient times.

Note, and that pokemon existed alongside them. But... how? Unless some kind of time travel was involved, whereby pokemon from the present or future was transplanted into the past (we already know Celebi does this at least sometimes). Yet, pokemon are considered different from the dinosaurs. So, humans know creatures that were not pokemon existed, but they essentially don't exist anymore, except for perhaps small insects or fish or something. Strange

Beyond that, the Space Shuttle Columbia, and even more. Yet, these references almost always seem to be shrouded in legend, or artifacts from the distant past. Almost as if there are cultural artifacts of these places, but they no longer exist.

*Evidence C:* Egg Groups. Unlike most real world animals, but they become a little more sensible with a Celebi-corrupted timeline. As pokemon continued to be introduced into the past, further evolutionary relatives of the older pokemon were able to stabilize their own predecessors, allowing for the creation of groups of pokemon which can somehow breed, probably due to some weird genetics (again, back to that pesky Mew...). 

*Evidence D:* The Regions. Now, if the areas are almost identical, that seems like a pretty good indicator that they are related in some way, but if so, then where are the cultural remnants? If we take the idea that the pokemon world is a future version of the real world, then where is the old cities, the ancient histories

""But, yes, that's interesting, but it only lends credence to my theory. There ARE remnants, but they almost legendary, being things only mentioned occasionally. Hell, entire cultures surrounding pokemon have risen and fallen, for instance). Why would Africa and China survive

Maybe there was a bottlenecking event. Or, like a reference to Atlantis. 

*Evidence E:* An Image of Earth. Another fun piece of evidence coming from HeartGold and SoulSilver, an egg of Palkia, Giratina or Dialga. That alone is cool, and potentially telling, but we have more important things to look at here. When Arceus is performing this miraculous act, a number of images flash on the screen for a split second. One of them is that of the Earth, seen from space. So

*Evidence F:* Parallel Universes. This is the thing that really got me thinking when I discovered it. It comes from Gen V, depending on which version of Gen V you play. In Black, Opelucid City is a huge, bustling metropolis of technological marvel that shows off some of the coolest things commercially available in the pokemon world. In White, Opelucid City is a city steeped in traditions, the people there rejecting change.

Cool, much stranger. 

There is a man in Opelucid City with a peculiar story. He says that his grandfather created a device that could see through time. The man has been using it to talk to his grandfather or something like that, but here's the kicker: he needs a pokemon *from the other universe.* In other words, the different versions of the games? They aren't just a gimmick. They have now been confirmed to be parallel versions of the same universe, where things are slightly different. And, somehow, Silph Co. and Devon Corp., and who knows who else, you can trade between games

So, that the space the two of you are teleported to in the Pokecenter is somewhere between the universes? Is it a kind of void space, or a conjoined space, or what? I have no idea, but apparently the multiworld theory is real in the pokemon universe.

In conclusion, the different versions of the games are all parallel universes of the same world, meaning that while the games build on each other, they might not all build on each other in the same way. There might be separate timelines involved.

1372197497.0,1h2en2,Why can't Nidorina or Nidoqueen breed? I have a theory.,alpharabbit,153,35,12,"This is a list of Generation I Pokemon in the Undiscovered Egg Group:

* Nidorina
* Nidoqueen
* Articuno
* Zapdos
* Moltres
* Mew
* Mewtwo

We can reduce this list further since we know Mewtwo came from Mew and Nidoqueen evolves from Nidorina:

* Nidorina
* Articuno
* Zapdos
* Moltres
* Mew

This leaves us with Mew, all the Pokemon who belong to this Egg Group are legendary and *not ordinary* in any way.

Now

&gt;Nidorina is comparatively larger than her pre-evolution, and incisor teeth.** She remains quadruped. Nidorina is also turquoise in coloration instead of bluish lavender, with a pale underside. Nidorina's poison spikes are larger and probably more potent; **she has also gained the ability to stand on her hind legs.**

Isn't it strange that Nidoran F would lose its horn after evolving into Nidorina only to regain it after evolving into Nidoqueen? And whereas Nidorino is strictly quadrupedal

My theory?

Nidorina is an ancient Pokemon, and some other ancestral Pokemon which gave rise to the Monster Egg Group:

* Cubone → Marowak
* Lickitung
* Kangaskhan
* Snorlax
* Monster/Grass (Bulbasaur's line)
* Monster/Dragon (Charmander's line)
* Monster/Water 1 (Squirtle's line + Slowpoke's line + Lapras)
* Monster/Field (Nidoran F + Nidoran M's line + Rhyhorn's line)

This ancestral Monster Pokemon would have **not** had a horn. It would have resembled a smaller version of Nidorina. In fact I think it would have looked like the Substitute doll: 

http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412piKhx5EL._SY300_.jpg

Which may have been the direct ancestor of Kangaskhan, and Slowpoke, Squritle, and Lapras are obviously related somehow.

Notice how, making a strong case for direct descent from Nidorina, parallel to Nidoqueen. Lapras' horn is a later aquatic adaptation, not a poison point.

However, and they are distinct, iconic characteristics of these Pokemon.

Basically, but only the male could evolve, as only the males were needed to protect the pack.

1351787024.0,12gp8a,The Biology of Pokemon: Magikarp,bluedonkey100,151,38,28,"As per request:
Magikarp
I find this one a little boring to be honest, its the only reason I didn't post until now...

**Reproduction:**  ""Magikarp are extremely plentiful, if not millions of eggs a season.  Magikarp survive through sheer numbers.
To reproduce a male (or many males) swim along beside a female Magikarp, and develop into full grown Magikarp, clogging rivers once they hatch.

**Growth:** Once the Magikarp has hatched they are still attached to the yolk of their egg, reaching full size after just a couple weeks.  Magikarp reaches a size of 0.9m and 10.0kg.

**Nutrition:** Just like other pokemon, Magikarp have been known to eat their own eggs and larva in a brutal display of uncharacteristic violence.

**Moveset:**

* Splash: Splash is a young Magikarp's only ""attack"".  In theory it is believed it is a desperate attempt to end a depressingly sad life.  Most Magikarp's never evolve into a Gyrados

* Tackle: The few Magikarp that reach level 15 have lived long enough that their scales have hardened significantly and they may now throw themselves at opponents

* Flail: At this point, so once it's life is put in jeopardy it attempts to defend itself to the best of its abilities. This is why damage increases as Magikarp's health goes down.

**Evolution:**
Magikarp clearly undergoes some kind of huge metamorphosis when he evolves. But how does this little fish, due to the fact that it takes place at extremely deep depths (I mean those deep waters on the other side of the rock walls in the ocean).  The current theory states that one piece of the puzzle is missing, that Magikarp actually has an evolution before Gyrados. It is uncertain what this secondary evolution is. Perhaps it is a chrysallis, similar to Kakuna, or Metapod.  Or perhaps it is some larger intermediate fish.  Until we are able to dive down to such low depths, we will not no for sure how Magikarp evolves.

**Abilities**

* Swift Swim: Magikarp gets slippery when wet

* Rattled: Magikarp may have a deathwish, bugs, and ghosts (aren't we all). Thus, when attacked by these types of pokemon, Magikarp will run in terror, effectively increasing their speed.

The Poke Marts and Poke Centers and other misc. buildings are managed by the staff to make sure things are in order and people (and Pokémon) can get the proper (medical or other) attention that is desired.

In order to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z, you need the Dubious Disc, a disc whose origins and purpose are totally unknown. Plus, Porygon-Z can be seen as a corruption of the name Porygon2, since the Z is like a corruption of the number 2.

However, references to real world animals vanished and it was revealed a Pokemon was responsible for the creation of the world. A Pokemon creating the world easily explains the world being populated by Pokemon, but it doesn't explain how humans came to be.

Humans are completely different life forms than Pokemon. They don't 'evolve' in the same way Pokemon do. They certainly cannot breed with them (squick). They cannot learn elemental attacks. On top of that

So if we accept that humans are completely different life forms, but even that seems strange because why would this being create these life forms completely different than the ones derived from Him?

So here is my theory: Humans came to be in a separate reality from Pokemon. The idea is that Arceus brought humans into the realm of Pokemon from another dimension. Perhaps this dimension was dying and the Alpha Pokemon protected these humans by giving them a place in His world.

1358191808.0,16kffp,How the Legendaries fit to the World as we know it (kinda long),billyK_,120,21,48,"Each legendary, with their specific abilities and all

We know Arceus created the world as we know it, in a way, humans too(more on that later). Arceus created Dialga and Palkia, the beings of time and space. The third of the trio, Giratina, was banished to the Distortion World, where Chaos (Giratina) rules. Like Tyler185 said with his post (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/16i4zb/all_the_cute_legendaries_are_fail_safes_against/), or fall backs in case of a rampage. Celebi, if needed

So Arceus created the world, knowing Mew needs a place to put the things it creates, created Kyogre and Groudon, being of super-extreme power of land and water. Unfortunately, we saw in the games how they really don't get along when they meet. Arceus is forced to make Rayquaza, a fail safe for the two of them. Or is it? Kyogre, mentioned in the other theory has another fail safe: Manaphy. But what about Groudon? It might be strange, which Groudon can create. Even though there's no ""way"" to subdue Groudon

The planet is made, Jynx to just name two) that have human like characteristics. Shaymin is made to help bring life to areas, thus helping Mew even more. Arceus aids in this two, and, to prevent the continents from moving more, puts Gigas in a deep sleep. It gives Man the ""power"" to re-awaken Gigas, in the forms of the Regis. However, and locks up the Regis, others use it as pets. Arceus keeps watching

And turns out, Arceus creates Ho-oh, and Lugia, each with the power to cripple Man's technologies, so that the war may end. But, in the process, Ho-oh destroys some of the civilian things, according to legend: Vaporeon, turning them into the legendary beast trio. They stay

The war is still raging. Lugia uses its power to create the bird trio, and the Seafoam Islands. Once Man was removed from the areas, the birds stayed, in case men wanted to regain the areas. Finally, the war ends, but we are not sure of how that occurs either. My theory is that Meloetta, after being created by Arceus, and such power was put behind it that it lost its voice. The world begins to rebuild

Then, and creates Victini, a Pokemon of immense power. Red waits on Mt. Silver, waiting for the trainer to oppose him. If Red wins, Victini will unleash its power on Red, making sure trainers would never get as strong as Red again. But Gold wins, and Victini doesn't have to use its power.

So, and how does Arceus's fail safe fit into the world, if it exists? It's the Unown. Arceus gave Man lots of things: this included an alphabet based from the Unown. So, the Unown had to have been in existence back when Mew was creating Pokemon, right? Yes, but Arceus itself created the Unown. We saw in the 3rd Pokemon movie what a ton of Unown can do, power-wise. If Arceus ever ""got out of hand"", or its Creation?

TL;DR: Arceus creates legendaries based on the things needed at the time. As precautions, created fail safes for the legendaries, that could subdue them when the time was needed. Mew creates Man from Pokemon, and Man get the power to harness Pokemon. Pokemon War starts, Meleotta ends it. Red is born, gets super-powerful, Victini is created to prevent Red from ruling the world with his power. Arceus's fail safe is the Unown.

If Mew was invented only to propagate lesser Poke-life, then why does it contain the essence of the legendary pokemon? It would mean that Arcaeus would have very intense, secret plans for Mew; perhaps as a replacement God for if the worst occurs.

But we have to take this under rational consideration. If one puts the two ideas side by side, in the end is the theory of Mew speciation.

I don't think there are specific League rules or anything that limit the number of Pokemon a trainer can carry with them. Rather I think the limit is set by an individual's ability to care for and manage animals

Using a real world analogy, so more puppies should be even better! but then why doesn't everyone have homes flooded with pets? its becauses trying to take care of , much less control, multiple rambunctious animals at a time is difficult and a hassle.  This is why most families only keep one or two pets. This is also why different trainers keep different amounts of pokemon.

Nothing is stopping youngster joey from rolling the elite four with 100 top percentile rodents, except for some trainers, they may be. This is somewhat supported in HG/SS, when they speak about dragon taming as if it were some special ability, that not every trainer can manage to handle powerful dragon type pokemon. This would indicate that a person's temperament is an important factor in determining what kinds and possibly how many pokemon some one could train. The limit in game of six pokemon might just represent the main characters own limitations, they had to set the boundary somewhere and its set as equal to the elite four to show that he is far more skilled in training than the average, but sit provides balance so you cant overpower the four with as many as you like. 

As a side note i think this theory may give some redemption to Ash. Its pretty well known that Ash is terrible at battling pokemon, even getting along with powerful legendary forces in the movies. He constantly walks around with a large possey of pokemon often kept outside of their pokeballs. Another criticism is He also does not evolve his pokemon often but this could be either to respecting the pokemon's choice (pikachu) which shows a valuable empathy trait, or he is wise enough to recognize his own personal limits. Ash may realize he wouldn't be able to handle all his pokemon in ultramegapower mode, remember what happened when he started evolving charmander?

   Another, giving it regenerative capabilities and functioning as a brain for the Pokemon. Attacks are often dealt from this core, and this core transmits radio signals, and light. This Pokemon is Staryu. Staryu may have also stemmed from a virus from space and quickly mutated into the star Pokemon, though it is unlikely for this to have happened so often. It is more likely that the meteor carried the crystalline organ and the virus then facilitated growth of the star-body from the core. 

   The mutation involved in making Deoxys must have involved enhancement of its core's transmitting power, showing that the core is very capable of this. As further evidence of this, in the movie *Destiny Deoxys*, Deoxys was seen gaining control of robotic cubes with its core.

If so, especially Hypno. It seems that most people know what a Hypno is, but you rarely actually encounter a trainer with one. This would likely lead to folklore, similar to a real world chupacabra, and mythical stories of what Hypno does for fun. The story being that once, a Hypno hypnotised a child and took it away. Hearing this, Red would record it in his pokedex since he hasn't got much else to go on. 

Additionally, but rarely saw one, so stories started to go about of a child who turned into a Kadabra.

Another interesting point is Cubone. Considering the first time you encounter one is just before fighting the ghost of it's mother

Compare these to the entries for Pidgey. Red has the chance to observe Pidgey a lot before the chance to catch one. This means that he is able to make note of their actions as a species.

Eevee is a very interesting pokemon in the fact that it can evolve into so many types. Its Pokedex entries state that Eevee's genetic code is erratic and because of that

I can't help but wonder if this means that Eevee was the first pokemon created by Mew and used as a blueprint for all subsequent pokemon. The idea is that Mew allowed radiation to flood certain types of areas (volcanoes, bodies of water, electrically charged/magnetic fields, grassy forests, ect) and made Eevee’s DNA in such a way that it could be manipulated or have code ‘filled in’ by such radiations. By allowing the “normal” Eevee to react differently to so many environments, Mew was able to figure out which abilities were best applicable to certain areas and created pokemon types to have an elemental advantage in extreme habitats. As Eevee continued to interact with these environments, the radiation Mew made them react to in regards to these environments wore off/was used up and became a rarity in the modern world.  What’s left is now mined as rare evolution stones.

Eevees are now a rarity because they can no longer adapt to their environments because there aren't enough stones to go around. They're no longer able to 'evolve' to environmental standards and are forced to remain in it's most basic and helpless form.

-----

The general thesis:  Perhaps [hundreds of] millions of years ago (date to be verified)

I will digress: due to time constraints
 
-----

Theory #1 (I shall refer to this as the volcano theory):

* Mt. Moon is now a dormant volcano; in pre-historic times

Supporting Evidence for (1):

* The above theory was devised after I did a brief exploration into the Rhyhorn-Rhydon-Rhyperior family.  It is said that Rhydon is ""capable of living in molten lava up to 3600 degrees""

* Pewter city: this city pays homeage to the rock attribute.  It is known that as magma cools, gave birth to the city's eventual theme/name when humans colonized the area.

* Cerulean city: upon entering this city, and isn't actually that close to an ocean or a sea.  How is this possible?  I theorize that there is a large reservoir/underground lake/ground water in the vicinity, geologically speaking.  If you venture deep in to Cerulean cave, you will notice that there is an abundance of water down there - an underground sea, if you will.  This reservior was present at the time of the Mt. Moon eruption, and this water served to prevent the progression of magma on this side of the volcano, contrast to the Pewter area.  As the localized area was effictively saved from devastation due to this ground water, nugget bridge is called this for a reason - for the abundance of gold that can be found in the vicinity.  You are given a nugget piece upon making your way across the bridge

* Back to the Rhyhorn family - remember how Rhydon was said to be ""capable of living in molten lava up to 3600 degrees""?  I believe this family of pokemon originally populated the area of Mt. Moon, relocation would have been necessary due to the pursuit of food and water).  Cerulean cave would have been a perfect place to relocate as it would have sheltered the young, and also had a good supply of water, as mentioned earlier.  Likewise, many other 'smart' pokemon also fled to Cerulean cave, for protection and the abeforementioned water supply.  In general, I will say that the 'smart' pokemon are those who have more experience and ability to escape/survive disaster - and this would translate to what trainers call 'higher levels'.  This would explain why we see such high level pokemon dominate the cave.  Please keep in mind that I'm not necessaily saying that the pokemon you encounter are millions of years old, are the surviving descendants of the original survivors (strong family lineage).  As another aside

* Note that the fossil pokemon you found in R/B/Y all shared rock attributes.  I postulate that this rock attribute is what allowed those pokemon to become fossilized.  As the Rhyhorn family could survive molten temperatures, and their fossils would not have been preserved.


Implications of the volcano theory:

* We can get a nice picture of the geography in the region before the catastrophe occured.

*  We can deduce why Pewter city and Cerulean city pay homeage to the rock and water attributes

*  We can explain why there is an abundance of high level pokemon in Cerulean cave.

-----

Theory #2 (I shall refer to this as the meteor theory):

* Moon stones are commonly found at Mt. Moon

* Please refer to [here](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031202065204.htm) for details on fallout and apply it to the pokemon universe

Theory #3 (I shall refer to this as the colonization theory):

* It is generally accepted that the Clefairy/Clefable family is from outer space.  Mt. Moon may be the family's choice of location for colonization, exterminating them, and in the process turning them into fossils.

Please note that the meteor/colonization and volcano theories could very well be independent of one another.  It is quite possible the volcano theory could be true

-----

General supporting evidence:

* In as early as Pokemon red/blue

* There are notices posted around/throughout Pewter city indicating that theives have been stealing fossils from Mt. Moon - this clearly indicates that there are more fossils to be found.

* This indicates that there are certain (whole) species of pokemon who were completely wiped out due to some significant event.

1. Besides through the use of moves such as Metronome Sketch, Me First, etc. Mew and Ditto are the only pokémon able to use Transform

3.  The fact that Mew has the DNA of every Pokémon in existence

Now, it gets into a certain state, which, by the way, is very similar to a same state that can be seen when it is [getting out of the pokéball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZY3H613jo&amp;t=0m28s).

Both states are also similar to the state Ditto gets into [when it transforms into another Pokémon](http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xp24ua?start=317). So

1. Mew gave origin to other pokémon by transforming into them and breeding. Thus I guess the original pokémon wasnt ONE Mew
2. The other pokémon, being it the *transform state*, as it can be seen in the evolution process and the capture process
3. When a pokémon evolves, however, are defined by the species
4. Pokéballs are able to store pokémon when they are in the *transform state*, which is possible because he created them with this same power 
5. The powers of Transform explain why pokémon ""create"" clothes for themselves when they evolve
6. Pokémon that may evolve by merging with others, explaining why you can find underleveled evolved pokémon in the wild.

On the process of capture and evolution:

1. After gaining enough experience points
2. In order to be stored in a poké-ball, and that's why the pokémon's powers are hindered, as said by Cyrus.
3. Because of #2 is that why you can capture god-like creatures but you aren't able to use their godly powers at their best.

* **MAP EDITORS:** People who can edit maps WELL (to maybe create a spooky underworld or overworld of somesort, ie renovated gym or a city gone to ruin during a recent incident)

* **COMPOSERS:** I can make the soundtrack, I can't do non-music sound effects, if we'll ever need them.

* **MODDERS:** People who can change all the game data and change the audio, and just basically being able to glue the game together. **We need more modders! Please help!**

If you wish to help

Thank you!

1371936144.0,1gvila,More on the Cubone-Kangaskhan conspiracy.,Cisculpta,112,24,9,"One of the most well-known Pokemon conspiracies refers to Cubone's relation to Kangaskhan: If a baby Kangaskhan loses its mother- it places her skull on its head and subsequently becomes Cubone. If the mother does not die the baby will grow up to be a Kangaskhan. However

Kangaskhan are very rare and are found in Safari Zones in Kanto

So where did they all go?
Another well known theory refers to the recent Pokemon war. The Pokedex entry in Silver reads: ""To protect its young, who wouldn't utilize a Pokemon that will fight to the death. Also, Kangaskhan can learn extremely powerful attacks from almost each Pokemon type (Blizzard, Earthquake, Focus Punch, Hyper Beam, Solar Beam, Fire Blast

They may have also been subject to poaching- Giovanni is one of the few (if not only) trainers in Kanto with a Kangaskhan- suggesting Team Rocket or other criminal organizations may have been a factor in their endangerment; however

So why can we catch them?
Kuiper put forth an interesting speculation into the post-war Pokemon world in ""A deconstruction of the first generation Pokemon World."" stating that, but they may charge you to enter the Safari Zone- which probably funds conservation efforts.

Let's go back to the RBY days, a potentially more difficult and riskier effort than cloning a pokemon.

The purpose behind this hidden cloning project was for Giovanni to have a clone of himself.  This clone would serve to take Giovanni's place should something happen to him (say untimely death by illness or otherwise).  The process of creating Mewtwo happened well before the events of RBY, the cloned Giovanni is a successful project after the ""success"" in Mewtwo's creation.  During the chaos of Team Rocket's fall, the clone escaped from his ""captivity"" and stumbled into the world.

He quickly realized how to get around while also discovering just who he was.  Because of this, whom he had met and learned much from.  In time, the clone also took up the name **Byron** to further differentiate himself from his original.  Certain quirks of Giovanni were maintained in ""Byron,"" such as an affinity for pokemon of the earth.  Rather than ground-types however, Byron began to see more in the steel-types.  He soon became an admired trainer on Iron Island and a formidable challenge for passing trainers.

After a few years, Silver came across the clone.  In spite of the differences (wild hair, scruffy face, worn appearance), Silver clearly spotted the uncanny similarities to his own father.  Silver angrily confronts the clone, but after a discussion becomes intrigued by him.  They speak more over several days and Silver soon takes to the clone better than he did his own father (remember their argument during the HGSS Celebi event.  Silver did not respect Giovanni nor did his find his father's delusional goals to be worthwhile/achievable).

After Silver and Byron bonded, and assuming others might note similarities, he began dying his hair from jet black to a rust color.  Silver, in spite of everything, also took to earth-based pokemon and began specializing in rock-types.  Before long (perhaps a year at most), Byron and Roark became gym leaders of Canalave City and Oreburgh City, respectively.  Their speedy rise can be attributed to Silver's/Roark's experience through Johto and Byron's experience on Iron Island.

And the abridged version:  Giovanni had a clone, returned after HGSS, met and bonded with Silver, and the two returned to Sinnoh where Silver took up a new name as Roark.

I've been lurking this subreddit for a few days now and I have been fascinated with what I've learned. I wish to dedicate time and effort to help support conspiracies and help us find the truth behind Pokemon. Enough about me

One of the conspiracies I was very fond of was the Lavender Town music. All concepts of it. From the suicides to the missing frequencies and so on. If you haven't heard of the missing frequencies here is the link to the popular video on YouTube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8

If you haven't read the description of the video I recommend it

The video part is significant for the fact that the Marowak's ghost appears twice in the video. Once somewhere around 3:00. And the second time around 9:00. The second time in the video it is accompanied by some Unown that spell out ""Leave Now"". The user ever so kindly left a .wav file for us in the description. So I went out and picked up a Spectrograph program (this is somewhat similar to the program used in the video) and see if it was truly there, and the so called ""Beta"" Lavender Town  music (the one that allegedly killed 200+ kids, which is also just a mere creepypasta with a lack of sources). I then converted the .mp3's to .wav's. I tested the one provided in the description first, and sure enough both instances of the ghost and the one instance of the Unown appeared. Interesting, but obviously not satisfying. The same occurred for the actual video's file. However it did not happen once in the actual or beta music. The reasons why are obvious, the edited video contains ""Missing Frequencies"". Which are edited in by the uploaders alleged friend. Although all that plays during those parts are almost white noise sounding noises. It's not actual music, much less to actually be included in the game. We all agree that Pokemon was directed at children for obvious reasons. It is not debatable that Nintendo or Game Freak would intentionally leave out these sounds just for someone to find in the end. They wouldn't. It could possibly butcher sales if something like that was done. All the speculation about the games is great but it's not something that was done by Gamefreak. I am determined to research as much as I can about Lavender Town but I feel that the music, and the beta version headache inducing

Conspiracy theories are great and I thoroughly enjoy them. This I don't find to be a necessarily a conspiracy theory. Rather deliberately modified material to spook the community. Wavelengths like that don't just form and they certainly aren't ""missing"". It doesn't sound good with the music and for them to form Unown which were not introduced to the Poke world until Generation 2 it is safe to say that this is an illogical theory and should not be accepted as real. 

Thank you for your time fellow conspirators.

1352256052.0,12rorl,The Biology of Pokemon: Eevee,bluedonkey100,112,31,16,"A couple points before I begin:

First

Secondly, the one with the most upvotes will be my next project, so get voting!

Eevee

**Reproduction:** Reproduction is similar to a Fennec Fox, but unfurl within a few days.

**Growth:**  The kits (baby Eevee's) are born blind.  Within 3 weeks the kits open their eyes
Eevee's are actually evenly distributed from male to female.  The cause for an uneven distribution in the wild is due to a few reasons.  Once a family is made, and rarely do they find the female. Eevee was once a very common sight, however, due to its fine fur and silky texture, it was hunted by primitive humans for blankets, clothes, and other cloth.  Because of this, scientists took female Eevees and bred them with dittos to repopulate. This is why Eevee's have become so rare and have become increasingly more common in each generation.

**Nutrition:** What an Eevee eats depends on the biome it lives in.  For example

**Natural Moveset:**

* Helping Hand: Being a family Pokemon

* Tackle: Eevee throws his entire body at his opponent.

* Tail Whip: By waving his bushy tail in an opponent's face

* Sand Attack: Eevee kicks sand at his opponent

* Growl: A menacing growl.

* Quick Attack: Being so small and light Eevee is able to move quickly and smash into his opponent at high speeds.

* Bite: Eevee's teeth have developed into strong sharp weapons, or chew through the tough skin of a Magikarp.

* Covet: Eevee can use it's quick movements to steal from his opponent.  This was an evolutionary trait  that was acquired once people started settling the world.  It is thought Eevee learned this to quietly steal food from humans.

* Take Down/Double-Edge: Eevee's skeleton is developed enough to take strong vibrations

* Charm: The name says it all.

* Baton Pass: An extension of Eevee's Helping Hand.  Being a sociable Pokemon it can easily give it's friends boosts.

* Last Resort: If Eevee is backed into a corner it becomes quite ferocious

* Trump Card: Similar to Last Resort

In order to evolve an Eevee releases certain hormones based on the environment.  Evolution is also affected by the parents (which is why ditto bred Eevee's are so popular, an Eevee is truly a marvel of Evolution.

**Vaporeon Evolution:**
An Eevee that spends a lot of time in an aquatic environment, and throughout the entire process an Eevee's fur will begin to wash away with the ocean, revealing a sleek undercoat.  The process begins with the splitting of the tail, taking a matter of weeks to reach the full split.  The gills and frills are the next to come, allowing the Vaporeon to breathe underwater for extended periods of time. Finally comes the dorsal fin, allowing Vaporeon to increase his speed.
Scientists have devised a way to bestow the nature of the sea onto an Eevee in a matter of minutes, it is known to cause a mass release of hormones creating the quick change from Eevee to Vaporeon.  No side effects are currently known.

**Jolteon Evolution:**
An Eevee that spends a lot of time near electrical plants, which becomes shorter, but much thicker in order to decrease the distance electricity must flow from the brain to increase reaction time.
A Thunderstone has similar effects to a Waterstone.

**Flareon Evolution:**
An Eevee that spends a lot of time near Volcanoes will evolve into a Flareon.  The gradual colour shift comes from the intense heat from lava
A Firestone has similar effects to a Waterstone.

**Espeon/Umbreon Evolution:**
Depending on whether Eevee is a nocturnal animal, a pre-Espeon will absorb sunlight in a manner similar to photosynthesis, however, instead of converting sunlight to energy for survival, it converts it into psychic power.  This psychic power builds up, corrupting many cells in Eevee's body, causing the change of fur, the Espeon's psychic powers will place the gem (or other important item) on Espeon's head
Umbreon is much less complicated.  It's fur becomes darker in order for it to blend in with the night

**Glaceon/Leafeon Evolution:**
These two evolutions are strange mutations found in the Eevee evolutionary spectrum.  Apparently the growth of a certain moss, causing an almost instantaneous evolution into Leafeon.
Once the moss has frozen, even through a solid wall of ice.  This mutated powder causes a similar (though still significantly different) reaction as the original powder.  Eevee once again has an extremely fast reaction to the powder, evolving into a Glaceon.

My theory is relatively simple.  Like, and disclude the Destiny Deoxys movie, we don't know exactly when this laser mutated the space virus into Deoxys.  Deoxys could very well have come into being before the G/S/C games (the first Pokemon to include Pokerus).  Please correct me if there is evidence in the games that can narrow down Deoxys' date of origin.  

So, even Deoxys itself is responsible for the introduction of Pokerus into PokeEarth's Pokemon population (alliteration just went to a whole new level).  

Now, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.  *Deoxys* is the living mutation of a virus found on a space rock, but what else is special about Deoxys?  It can morph into four different forms: Normal, Defense

Normal Form is pretty unremarkable compared to the other three.  Attack form raises both Deoxys' Atk and SpA stats.  Defense Form raises it's Def and SpD stats.  And Speed Form raises it's Spe stat.  Now, /r/pokemonconspiracies!

Growlithe are rare ( more so than in the games) and have just started to become domesticated (possibly before the invention of the pokeball) on farms. The growlithe herd the farm pokemon and fight off invading pokemon. This time is before the usefulness of stones was discovered so they were still a relatively common find. One way or another some of these farm growlithe end up in contact with a fire stone (owners keep the ones they find or growlithe finds one while chasing away a predator). So growlithe evolves into arcanine. In doing so he gets a change of attitude (like ash's charmander) and chooses to leave. The owners will usually only get a quick look at arcanine before it leaves (often beleiving that growlithe was eaten or taken away by the beast) Sometimes some of that old Growlithe loyalty will seep through and arcanine will choose to live near the farm and protect it. So legends rise up about the great creature that protects farms from invaders. Or the evil beast that takes growlithe away (and perhaps even burns down farms). The legends survive

1351533086.0,12abab,The Biology of Pokemon: Squirtle,bluedonkey100,106,24,43,"Squirtle

**Reproduction:**  The reproduction of a Squirtle is the same as a common sea turtle.  The male will mount the female from behind, is inserted into a small opening on the base of the female's tail.  This is called the cloaca. Sperm enters into the female and fertilization begins.
The female Squirtle lays her eggs in nests dug into the beach sand.  The eggs hatch and the baby Squirtles (known as Squirts) crawl back to the water

**Growth:** After hatching from their eggs, but in actuality, they never stop growing. The carapace or shell grows along with the body, until it reaches the size of a blastoise.  After 3 months the Squirtle can be considered level 1.  Squirtle also develops a water sac adjacent to his stomach.  Through ingestion of food and drink, some water is diffused through the stomach lining into the water sac, Squirtle can use this water sac to use various attacks, such as water gun and bubble.  Though this sac does not fully develop until Squirtle has become older.

**Nutrition:** Nothing special here

**Natural Moveset:** As a Squirtle gains levels it learns new moves:

* Tackle: Squirtle throws his body at his opponent

* Tail Whip: Squirtle taunts his opponent using his tail, creating an opening and thus, lowering defense.

* Bubble: Bubble is the result of a premature attempt at a water gun. The diffusion between the stomach and water sac is not yet perfect, other substances, such as carbon dioxide can enter into the sac. When Squirtle attempts to shoot a water gun at his opponent, it comes out more like a hiccough, though it does retain some force. The carbon dioxide and water vapour merge to create a thin layer of bubble that quickly forms a spherical shape to reduce surface area. This inflicts minor damage.

* Withdraw: Squirtle's shell is now strong enough to protect it from most attacks. When Squirtle enters his shell

* Water gun: The diffusion between the stomach and water sac has improved greatly, it is a stream of water.

* Bite: Squirtle's jaw has developed enough to deliver a devastating bite attack.

* Rapid Spin: Squirtle retreats into his shell and rapidly spins

* Protect: Squirtle's shell is now hard enough that he can retreat inside to prevent literally any attack.

* Water Pulse: Squirtle has more control over his water

* Aqua Tail: Squirtle diffuses water out his tail

* Skull Bash: The bones in Squirtle's head are strong enough to bash without fear of harm.

* Iron Defense: Squirtle's shell is now nearly impenetrable.

* Rain Dance: Squirtle releases an incredible amount of water

* Hydro Pump: Squirtle is able to heat the water in his sac and fire it out at high velocity. The sheer force of the attack is enough to knock most pokemon down.  This attack inflicts damage through force and heat and is Squirtle's most powerful move.

**First Evolution:** Squirtle's evolution is relatively slow when compared to other pokemon. As Squirtle does not stop growing he can be considered evolved once he has doubled in height and has increased in weight by a factor of 4.  Through Squirtle's lifespan he begins to grow long fluffy hair on his ears which reach their full span upon the completion of the Wartortle evolution.  A long fluffy tail also grows throughout Squirtle's lifespan, until it has become to big. Squirtle's squirrelly tail remains, however, it is often hidden by the newly grown fluffy tail.  Squirtle's evolution is completely through common growth, as opposed to the normal instant changes.

**Second Evolution:** Thoughout Wartortle's lifespan, as well as the growth of small ears.
Midway through the lifespan of a Wartortle, where the water cannons jut out. It has been theorized that these cannons which are attached to the water sac, are actually grown from the birth of Squirtle, and continue to grow throughout evolutions, experience accelerated growth at these stages.  Upon the evolution of Blastoise, these cannons  are fully formed and ready for use. The cannons are made of various fibers found in their diet that when combined become as hard as steel.

1362237180.0,19iviu,The real reason why there are so many Zubats.,icezora,111,34,20,"I haven't slept for 3 days so i'm going to give you the short and sweet version (the original was a convoluted mess)
Zubat is a bat like pokemon. It is nocturnal so it has to find a dark enclosure or area to roost in, in zubats case a prick with its fangs that absorbs a small amount of energy/blood/lifeforce/etc from the victim/animal/plant. To a person or pokemon this would feel like a butterfly needle, a small prick easy to overlook but just as if not more annoying that a mosquito bite. The more often the zubat feed the stronger they get and eventually gain the capability of biting, tearing, or pummeling the victim into submission in the aims of devouring it: especially as a collective swarm.  This wasn't always the case though. Back before the pokemon league the zubats were restricted to a small isolated region until they needed to introduce a direct path between the towns for the new gym. Once they demo'd that cave the zubats who were passive died, and the others who boldy fed on humans in a ninja/silent mosquito-esc manner lived on bred and mass and followed the pokemon trainers and fed on all of the weak/dead (""fainted"") pokemon and especially on their trainers (isolated/asleep/etc). Now it should be noted that the reason there are so many zubat is this: What eats Zubat? The answer is nothing, they are poisonous and anything that tries either dies or gets really sick.
But in the game zubat are really weak and easy to kill, and so thousands of zubat bites would probably cause you bleed to death.

At the end of the day the new routes made from the advent of the pokemon league released the hyperinvasive zubat to slowly but surely cover the globe. Food for thought: Zubat wasn't the only bat pokemon, zubats one because they are toxic.

Short Short Short version recap: Zubat has been in almost every region, but pokemon trainers are basically a walking buffet that leaves you free meals wherever they go. Why wouldn't they follow pokemon trainers? Where the pokemon trainers are zubats will follow, and if they aren't there yet, be patient they are on their way. ;)",,False,,False,t3_19iviu

Oak sends Ash on Pokemon journeys in each different region, waiting to decide when the time is right to kill Ash's dad. Professor Oak will do this by convincing Ash that his father is some villain like a leader of an evil organization.

So, and somewhere or another in all of this life begins. Mew included. Mew is the origin Pokemon, the first Pokemon in fact. 

""But what about Arceus and such?"" you ask. 

Well

Mew creates Pokemon as time passes

So the Universe continues doing stuff, as it grows older and wiser, makes better and better Pokemon. It can make stronger Pokemon and such.  Thus why more legendary Pokemon are in later generations, Mew knows what to do better.

Eventually

Mew sees this.

Mew creates Arceus, as eggs. Celebi, the time traveling Pokemon, is able to transport these new Pokemon backwards in time to the start of everything. This final burst of energy leads to the Universe finally collapsing, and Celebi transports them to the past before the Universe. This sparks everything as Arceus appears, moments later Palkia and Dialga appear. This appears to Arceus as creating them.  Somehow in all of this Giratina pops in.

Porygon family, respectively.


Know where I'm going with this?


While Pokemon scientists were designing the Poke Transfer system and the storage system


Therefore, the first artificial pokemon ever. It is technically a programming code, hence graying out the ethical areas of the experiment for pokemon transfer, since it is designed to do exactly that - to travel between cyber space and real life.


So, they gradually added complexities, to simulate a real pokemon. At the same time, by studying said complexities, scientists are able to access data as to how to transfer living beings into data. A cross research between Pokemon storage system and Porygon, if you will.


Pokemon in storage are then kept in cyberspace simulating their natural environment. Data with sentience will require a cyberspace simulating that appeals to their sentience - an artificial environment. Which is again

And the man who completed the data transfer machine


(Gen i of storyline completed.)


Now, pokemon training has seen a huge boom, thereby increasing the need for storage space. 


As the training boom grew exponentially


The solution - space. This is where Porygon2 comes in. However, and thereby the plan was scrapped, leaving Porygon2 half completed, thereby leaving Porygon2 unable to fly (pokedex entry). Porygon2 is then released as is for the general public.


With the space exploration plan scrapped


(Storyline for Gen ii


The plan was passed to allow research into this area, or even set up storage in these alien dimensions, an environment normal beings are unable to survive in. But with upgrades from Porygon2 to Porygon-Z, it is hoped that it will be able to set up the servers in the alien space, retreating into cyber space if necessary to prevent coding decay.


However, of course, an ongoing research in order to more efficiently store pokemon. After achieving sentience, research based on Porygon2 is halted permanently for ethical reasons. However, stubborn scientists looked on for alternative funding, in order to perfect the experiment they have spent their lives on. Thus, creating the Dubious Disk


(Porygon-Z introduced in gen iv.)


Turns out, for fear of altering these pokemon's natural habitat.


With no other alternative, and has least impact on pokemon habitats - deserts, uninhabited islands, wastelands.

Maintenance toward these servers brought forth human population into these towns


(current ending of this story


**TL;DR: Porygon Family is directly involved in pokeball and storage experiments and research.**


extra: porygon is originally found as a prize in team rocket's possession because team rocket has had scientists break the code to prevent duplicates of porygon. A code to prevent porygon duplicates was stated in pokedex entries.


By breaking said code


the original company hoped to regain their losses in research costs through selling legitimate copies of porygon, and instead are content to test their luck at slot machines to win team rocket's exclusive (albeit mass produced) pokemon.

Now hear me out on this one

When I see these two besides each other it becomes fairly obvious that their shapes are extremely similar but it goes beyond that, the wings become the electricity and if you take the two fake eyes of masquerain and put them together you get the shape of Rotoms eyes

Thus when a Masquerain dies under certain situations it will be brought back as a Rotom

 personally I think that it is when it is hit by lightning this quote from the pokedex ""Because it can't fly if its wings get wet

 means that it will be in a place where lighting may strike more likely this explains the electric ability of rotom and it's possession comes about from merely being a poltergeist( A type of ghost known for playing tricks and taking over things)

1341320983.0,vz60s,The Great Unifying Theory (it's a long one),,92,17,32,"Okay so here's my attempt at creating a theory that unifies the games and anime (have not studied the manga

Let's begin with the creation of Pokemon. The Pokemon world is a separate universe. It is not Japan after a spot of radiation-induced mutation, revered rightly so in the Pokemon universe as a deity. This acceptance of the Pokemon universe being more akin to the abrahamic genesis take on reality allows for us to understand why Pokemon do not adhere to darwinian laws of evolution and why many defy what we know as the laws of nature in our own universe. Pokemon were created in their current forms, with set methods of growing (a Pokemon evolving is more like a larval animal evolving into an adult animal as opposed to it becoming a different species). Non-Pokemon creatures, such as humans, fish, mongooses, lions etc, who had seen these creatures in our reality. If Mew is indeed the common ancestor of all Pokemon, air

Next we have the history of Pokemon. Before Apricorns were utilised as a storage method for Pokemon, as this was likely how Neolithic through to Feudal humans domesticated Pokemon, and then came the poke balls with technological advances, allowing humans multiple bonds with Pokemon that could all remain on the human's person, hence why leaving your Pokemon in the PC causes your bind with them to wither.

Now we come to the hotly debated issue of the Pokemon war, on all scales, since Arceus created the world. The first people to domesticate Pokemon, due to their elemental powers, would have likely become the first major despots and warlords. But as the practice of domesticating and discover new and more powerful kinds of Pokemon became more widespread, the use of Pokemon as a form of dominance became more contested.what began as small tribal conflicts over land, resources or just humanities own reasons, perhaps more recently in terms of the games, Johto, and likely defected to the East or moved there once relieved from conscription

Finally, Brandon/May etc are the Pokeworld's equivalent to the Demi-god heroes of ancient Greece and Rome. All except Brandon/May have no father, only a mother who is well provided for regardless of an apparent lack of a job. And Brandon/May look absolutely nothing like their father, Brandon in particular due to his white hair. And explanation for you character is: you are the direct descendant or Arceus, in a Jesus/Heracles fashion. This is why you alone can master the Legendary Pokemon who are unibtainable by all other humans. These Sons of Arceus share a bond, their Pokemon can be transported to each other to aid each other in their journies. Their bonds with their Pokemon are stronger than that of other trainers because they share an essence with the being that created all Pokemon, and are loved/catered for by most humans because they share and essence with the creator of all humans. Every one is a hero, which is why Pokemon is such a vibrant and fantastic universe.

Praise be to Arceus
Criticisms most heartily welcomed!

TL;DR - Pokemon is another universe

Red's from the middle of no-where. The only reason Pallet Town is conceivably on the map is because Professor Oak lives there. The town's more of a recently started settlement than a town. So Red and Green/Blue, who cares? They're just some kids from Pallet, what're they gonna do?

But then that quiet one in the hat boots Team Rocket from Mt. Moon. He starts getting badges rather quickly, he's stopping some mafia group before anyone else even realizes they're there. This kid is something different.

He takes down Koga, fights Giovanni so many times that the guy straight up takes off. Red just took down an entire criminal organization with a Pikachu and swept the gym leaders like they were a bunch of Sudowoodo during a flood. This kid's great. Pallet Town's known for being Red and Green's town, now. 

So Red makes it through Victory Road without breaking a sweat, because of these two. They're waiting in anticipation for the kid in the red cap to duke it out with the professor's grandson.

Venusaur and Pikachu beat Lorelei, and Lapras takes care of Lance's dragons. Everyone's waiting in bated breath as he heals his pokemon up and takes the walk to the champion's room, only for him to blink in surprise because, lookit that, Green's the champion.

So Red wins anyway.

The spunky mute kid from that little blip on the map finally did it, he's so good. So the moment he steps out of the league, rambunctious grin on his face, bravado radiating, the media swarms him.

Everywhere he goes, everyone wants his autograph. He can't even go home without the paparazzi stalking him. So maybe he visits Johto.

Oh, they share the same league. Well, hey, maybe there's Hoenn, Sinnoh? Nah, he's made a big enough buzz in two whole regions that the others caught on. Even Unova, who's usually too far away from the others that they don't get the same crazes.

So what to do? There's no-where he can run, the most dangerous peak in the world, as currently recorded. The dividing line between Kanto and Johto. If the media can follow him there, he's not safe anywhere.

So he waits at the top. It's cold, and gets used to the temperature. Eventually he makes a stairway on his favorite rock spire.

And he waits.

Johto's attacked by Team Rocket, Unova's attacked by PETA, and then nearly frozen over. More young upstarts from small towns make the headlines. So Red decides, ""hey, now is as good a time as any.""

Let us start from the beginning


Scientists-nor we, something happened that made just two small atoms to create an Explosion, creating a mass amount of dark energy to hurl through the universe. This dark energy somehow formed planets, galaxys, stars, and black holes. **We see this move used day to day-Explosion.** 
Scientists also believe that this dark energy is limited, the universe will stop expanding and stop spreading dark energy into places that has no dark energy. **Conclusion: The pokemon move ""Explosion"" is a mimic of what happened billions of years ago at the center of the universe. A creation of another universe doesn't happen every time a pokemon uses explosion because it doesn't have the ability to spread Dark Energy through a place where dark energy is already.**



Fast forward billions of years-the earth as we know it is being formed. Bacteria has reached earth, eventually creating the first ""Pokemon""-a more gorilla-like Mew. **Thanks to the Pokerus virus, evolution was sped up in certain bacteria to create the first Pokemon before the first human** Mew looks different today then he did so many years ago, as gradual evolution is what made him adapt to his society. Needless to say, mew eventually found a way to create many of the ancient pokemon (much more primitive then their forms, as kabuto looked much different millions of years ago then he does ""now"").
We cannot forget about the bacteria now know as a form of Pokerus, but this one last bacteria, able to control certain pokerus that it had to take over to adapt, is still around today-and very powerful. **This bacteria is known today as Deoxys, a very hostile pokemon, due to the fact that it spent millions of years learning to adapt by being ruthless, which is the only thing it knows now.** Evidence given to scientists that Deoxys is apart of a Pokerus that never goes away is that it can change its speed, and attack whenever it wants to



Now one can believe that Sinnoh myths are factual with no real scientific evidence, don't follow the rest in his small Pokemon and go explore (being so isolated, his group of Pokemon could not survive when other Pokemon attacked, as they did not know what to do.) and found a primitive group of people writing down what you today know as the ""Sinnoh myths"". The group of primitive people did not know this pokemon Arceus was, so they made him their god. **Due to the small group of people claiming Arceus to be a ""Poke-god"", many people believe that he is, in fact, too



Arcues eventually found his true power as a pokemon and followed what people were telling him what he did, Giratina and Dialga do, but there are many different theorys on how and why they can) which is a nearly impossible thing to do without a certain mutation, he is not a Poke-god, **yet a Pokemon from an extinct group of Pokemon who has made himself believe that he is a Poke-god.**",,False,t5_2tpgv,True

First off, make more money. Therefore, anyone can make money.

On to Pokemarts. Assuming that human food can be found at marts, marts make quite a bit of money from people needing Pokeballs, potions, etc., along with human food. I theorize that, in order to maintain steady prices and free health care for Pokemon, the invisible government has to tax the heck out of the marts and leave enough for the clerks to live comfortably.

Which then leads me to that free healthcare. In order to maintain the supplies and staff

Taxing the marts alone is probably not enough to maintain so much, what if the Gyms and the Elite Four are also regulated and run by the government? The gov't supplies a (presumably sizable) paycheck to gym leaders/trainers and the members of the E4, who in turn make money for the government by giving them all their battle winnings. I think it's safe to assume that people would aim to be a part of the E4 to gain riches and fame, and since anyone can be a Pokemon trainer, this goal seems very attainable. What I'm getting at is that the gyms and the Elite Four must get a lot of challenges and must send a lot of those challenges packing.

I'll also point out the various power plants and mines across the games. They more than likely would be government-run so that the gov't can then seize the assets and distribute them to whatever they feel needs the help; most likely the majority of the the energy would be sent straight to the Pokemon Centers

Then, unless they are non-ditto derived (Legendaries) or based too strongly on something non-natural (a magnet-derived ditto mutation--magnemite--wouldn't be ""natural"" enough to have male and female DNA distinctions)

I was over in /u/hashp0rridge's (who I now will refer to as Rory) house and we came across this idea of Pokemon conspiracies. We found a huge list of conspiracies and we just discussed them. It was the famous theory

Before we knew it we created the subreddit and tried to get it going. This wasn't easy. We posted countless threads of old theories. It was going no where. After a month we had about thirty-forty subs. The enthusiasm was declining. 

We were talking about letting it go when I saw a post in /r/pokemon of a conspiracy. I saw people saying they wanted more of it! I posted a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/rtm0s/another_pokemon_conspiracy_theory/c48lgbp?context=3) advertising the subreddit. This was at 4AM so I decided to head to bed. I woke up to four miss calls from Rory. I rang him and he said something like ''DIGGY (me) WHAT DID YOU DO?'' We had gained about 400 subs in eight hours and were still increasing. 

After a week we'd grown into the high hundreds (Around 800-900 subs). Rory posted in some subreddit for finding mods. Through this we found Ghax (aka /u/pokemonconspiracies). I can tell you right now without this man, our super powerful janitor basically.

By the end of April we were bigger than /r/boobs. You have to understand how crazy this was for two suburban nerdy kids. We flipped our shit. 

We weren't done yet though. We all sent messages to the /r/pokemon mods asking to add us to the sidebar. We'd received no response after a couple of weeks. We grew restless. I submitted a post asking for the mods to stop ignoring us and add us to the sidebar. I asked for our subs to upvote it and send the mods messages. You guys delivered. So epicly. Before 24 hours was up we were added to the sidebar. Now we had a fan base so we decided to work on the sub's image. 

The three mods decided we needed someone who knew CSS to design our subreddit. We got /u/Lunar_Sunrise to work on it. What you see now is similar to the initial design. Rory and Ghax wrote the sidebar. 

There's not much more to it. We brought in /u/daly192 in about May just for a little more mod support. He created the Fiction Conspiracy Network which is still going strong. 

We had a created a new type of sub fandom and that's crazy! So thanks to all of you guys for upvoting posts, Daly, Lunar_Sunrisre and anyone else who helped in anyway at all. You're all great. I've loved being apart of this. This community is fantastic! Just a bunch of people discussing Pokemon. 6 year old Digrish would be so jealous right now.

Embryos are developed in fluid, with the intention to evolve (see [recapitulation theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory)), and given the mammalian-like nature of Mew, it was developed in an embryonic fluid sac. So what happens to this sac of nutrients and evolutionary potential when Mew is developed and set free? It becomes Ditto.

1352769931.0,133hly,The Biology of Pokemon: Chikorita,bluedonkey100,95,33,19,"Chikorita

**Reproduction:** A Chikorita has similarities in reproduction with both plants and animals.  Fertilization occurs in one of two ways.  A Chikorita may become impregnated in the same way of a mammal, as this allows their species to become more diverse, with less effort.  However; other species breeding more often consists of mammalian fertilization.
Upon impregnation, a small leaf can be seen growing out of the ground.  Within 4 months, the baby Chikorita has become fully grown, and a large leaf sticks out of the ground where she was buried.  The mother proceeds to dig around her baby, helping her out of the ground.  At this stage Chikorita is fully matured.

**Growth:** Once the egg is implanted into the ground (a process simply known as implantation) the egg grows roots (similar to a seed).  The roots absorb nutrients from the ground and help the baby to grow inside the egg.  After about 2 weeks the Chikorita begins to crack the egg as it grows bigger

**Natural Moveset:**

* Razor Leaf: A Chikorita's leaf grows at an almost instantaneous rate.  This is so a Chikorita may hide from predators by blending in.  If something were to grab her leaf; the leaf could detach and Chikorita would be able to run without hindrance. If Chikorita were to concentrate energy from her body into her head

* Poison Powder: Small spores begin to grow on Chikorita's leaf.  These spores are highly toxic

* Synthesis: On top of eating small organisms

* Reflect/Light Screen: Chikorita is able to briefly release a large amount of potential psychic energy.  It is currently unknown why some Pokemon are able to use the psychic ability possessed by all pokemon, some cannot release any.  When a Chikorita releases it's energy an invisible wall forms in front of her, protecting her from any direct physical attacks.

* Magical Leaf: An extension of Chikorita's Razor leaf attack.

* Natural Gift: After ingesting a berry; a Chikorita may use it to fuel an attack based on the type of berry.  This is done through a combination of the berry and the energy absorbed from the sun.

* Sweet Scent: Upon reaching prime breeding age a Chikorita can release a special set of hormones that smell sweet

* Safe Guard: A Chikorita is able to protect itself from all status ailments using a combination of psychic power and sunlight energy

* Aromatherapy: Like Sweet Scent

* Solar Beam: Solar beam is an extreme buildup of solar energy through photosynthesis. Chikorita releases the energy in a powerful beam of light from her mouth.  This is Chikorita's most powerful defence.

**Bayleef Evolution:** Chikorita's evolution is similar to Bulbasaur.  A large release of stored solar energy stimulates the accelerated growth of Chikorita.  Chikorita grows 0.3m (A foot) and a similar growth occurs in its leaf.  Chikorita's legs become more pronounced and the seeds around her neck grow larger

**Meganium Evolution:**  Chikorita's second evolution happens more gradually.  With Bayleef acting as an intermediate.  Bayleef continues to grow as she absorbs sunlight, with antennas sprouting and eventually becoming fully formed.  It is suggested that the antennas replace the leaf, as the leaf is no longer a necessary defence. Meganium is near the top of the food chain, becoming a predator as opposed to prey, the antenna increase her field of detection, making it easier to catch her prey.

Third, think of this: have you ever heard of the saying 'Love is in the air'? Well, I think Sylveon is a literal representation of that: a Flying Pokémon that spreads love and affection all around it.

And finally

And those were all of my thoughts on what I think Sylveon will be. 

Now watch me jump off a cliff as GameFreak announces it to be a Light-type.

&gt;According to Ace Trainer Beverly

The cave became closed up in Black 2 and White 2. 

I'm also curious about Scorched Slab. 

&gt;Scorched Slab is modeled after one of the real-life locations that is claimed to be Amano-Iwato, shut herself up for a long time in Japanese mythology. This explains why there is nothing to find in Scorched Slab but TM11 (Sunny Day).

EDIT: From Wikipedia's page on Amono Iwato

&gt;Ama-no-Iwato (天岩戸?) literally means ""The cave of the sun god"" or ""heavenly rock cave"". In Japanese mythology, was the one who drove Amaterasu into Ame-no-Iwato. This caused the sun to hide for a long period of time.

&gt;In order to get Amaterasu out of the cave the other gods threw a party outside. When she heard the noise she got curious and peeked but got blinded by the mirror Yata no Kagami and so she thought they were celebrating the arrival of an even greater and brighter goddess than herself. Though in reality it was her own mirror image. Then Tajikarao forced the cave to open up the rest and the world was bathed in light once again. As Amaterasu stepped out of the cave a holy seal was applied to it so that she couldn't go back into hiding.

Are there any theories or guesses about this?

The leading scholarly publication for POKEMON Research

Vol. 3 Issue 11

Submitted by Dr. JOSE Garcia

*Dr. Garcia received his PhD in POKEMON Computation under the tutelage of Dr. Satoshi FUJI.  His past research included work on POKEMON cloning technology.  He is an expert on the non-organic POKEMON PORYGON

**Notes On the Behavior of ELECTRODE**

&gt; Introduction

Like the other non-organic POKEMON, SILPH scientists, myself included, are not aware of any SILPH project concerning the production of an artificial POKEMON besides PORYGON.

My colleague Dr. BILL Tori, headed by Lt. Gen. Joshua 'SURGE' Conway, had explored the possibility before abandoning the project.  BILL strenuously refused to divulge how he knew this and denied having any further knowledge on the subject.  SURGE refused my request for an interview, citing DoD policy.

&gt; Appearance

ELECTRODE's internal power source is unknown, ELECTRODE can be used to power heavy machinery.  It appears that ELECTRODE is so efficient at generating power it is incapable of safely storing this electricity, frequently resulting in an EXPLOSION.

Its outer casing is a lightweight but durable aluminum shell which protects the fragile inner electronics and power unit.  The casing seems to be the same material that POKEBALLs are made from.  If ELECTRODE is in fact an intelligent self-replicating robot

Its cartoonish grin is not actually a mouth; ELECTRODE has no need to eat.  Rather, and appear to be some sort of LCD monitor display.

&gt; Behavior

ELECTRODE is an enigmatic and volatile POKEMON that evolves from VOLTORB once VOLTORB has built enough components to upgrade its hardware and operating system.  The upgrade replaces VOLTORB's small power unit with ELECTRODE's formidable reactor

Similar to MAGNETON, preferring instead to use its perfectly spherical body to roll around, which saves energy.

This POKEMON uses both non-lethal and lethal attacks to intimidate and deter enemies.  It emits an ear-splitting SCREECH from its speakers to repel intruders.  A more powerful version of this SCREECH creates a SONICBOOM.  Alternatively

To attack, the resulting ROLLOUT squashes anything foolish enough to stand in the way.  Some of the aforementioned behaviors are only used by ELECTRODE in captivity as they require ELECTRODE to download a TECHNICAL MACHINE.

As a last resort, it is capable of directing the EXPLOSION away from its own body.  In the rare case that the ELECTRODE's casing is stripped off, the ELECTRODE CPU is able to slowly rebuild itself over many weeks or even years.  To date, nobody has observed a ""naked"" ELECTRODE without its casing.

The world would have no god and wars would start with no one to stop them. Arceus created a new being. He named them DUNSPARCE.

Well... Perhaps a while ago, coming close to the size of Voltorbs.

The main reason Voltorbs wouldn't be considered to have developed until more modern times?  Probably because of the color scheme developed for the main pokeballs hadn't come out yet.  Until the colors were truly standardized, they developed a similar camouflage.  I know it's a game mechanic, but the ""item"" containers that you can see on the screen while scrolling look like giant pokeballs--perhaps the larger pokeballs are still used (or their likeness is used) for packaging of gifts or products.

This leads me to the second part of my theory. The seas. Water represents life. From 10th grade biology, then slowly started getting more and more complex until a single pokemon emerged. It was pink and swam around the ocean for thousands of years, though it had no fins or gills. It used a giant bubble as a breathing apparatus. Natural selection occurred and many pokemon were created. Genetic variation caused different species to be born and pokemon evolved so they could adapt to their environment/predators. Later, the pink pokemon who would later be called Mew, strolled onto land and did it as it did in the water. Producing asexually (at first), Mew created the different types by traveling to different environments and adapting to its surroundings. Each different Typed mew then produced sexual offspring, creating different species of pokemon. This is supported by Mew's ability to transform, and the fact that it contains the DNA of every pokemon.

The pokemon are controlled by their trainers through cybernetic implants that get inserted and programed when a pokemon is put into a pokeball for the first time.

Why are wild Pokemon at different levels based on their location? It's all explainable:

Pokemon located near the starter town/lab are lower leveled because the lab was founded there for that purpose. Labs are established in breeding areas so as to study younger Pokemon

Areas like the Seafoam Islands, Sevii Isles, Mt. Ember and other dungeons have stronger Pokemon simply because the environment is so harsh in these areas. Extreme examples are Mt. Silver, Cerulean Cave and the Spring Path.

The Pokemon in Victory Road (and any preceding routes) are so strong because the Elite Four make them that way

Some gyms would have a reputation/history of being stronger than others. Since their Trainers on the surrounding routes would then also be stronger. The wild Pokemon in the area would logically be stronger

1364502095.0,1b74zu,Unova poison theory.,chaoskings35,89,27,20,"In Pokemon poison and venom seem to be classified as one and the same. If we follow this train of thought and add in the fact that in all generations prior to generation 5 the poison/venom hurts the Pokemon when you move them and that gen 5 changes this we can assume that either:

 1) The Pokemon native to Unova can resist the poison/venom better than previous Pokemon

Or

2) The poison/venom of Unova is in some way different than that of  kanto, and Sinnoh.

In our world venom is classified into 2 separate categories known as neurotoxins, which affect the cardiovascular system. My theory is that in Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh the poison/venom is comparable to that of hemotoxins which would affect them inside the stasis of the pokeball because the blood still has to pump to keep them alive and because the pain caused by it is often more extreme, while Unova has neurotoxin that would not affect them in the pokeball as much due to the slower and less direct nature of the harm it causes and because the pokemon may only operate on the basics needed for life within the pokeball. 

Thoughts?

Edit: when talking about the differing poisons I meant that hemotoxins take a more immediate affect then neurotoxins.

Edit 2:Most people within the thread seem to lean towards a change in the technology of the pokeball and as  read more of your ideas and theorems I can't help but see the viability of it so I feel that I needed to add it to the main post text (I actually feel kind of stupid for not thinking of that possibility).

3) The technology of the pokeball has changed in some way that neutralizes the poison/venom

And /u/shifter25 your theory on this: 

Gen IV, and the reason Pokemon have to be caught with a new ball in the Pal Park if brought over from Gen III is because prior to Gen IV, Pokeballs were not modifiable.
By Gen V, and it would be cheap to allow trainers to simply switch in and out to cure it, like confusion.) The people who made the new balls in Gen IV anticipated new advancements and made them modifiable, so that instead of having to use new balls, the old balls simply undergo a treatment at the PokeTransfer facility.

1364135191.0,1awwqc,Legendary sentience and apathy. ,chaoskings35,76,17,27,"After re-watching many of the pokemon movies and replaying many of the games I have concluded that their is a relationship between the following things:

The more bestial a legendary is in appearance the less sentient it is. Good examples of this are the legendary trio of Hoenn. In mythology they created/formed the world, stupid. At least when compared to other legendary pokemon like mew and mewtwo. Groudon and kyogre are probably the best example for this because they are fueled by blind rage against each other. 

The closer they are to deity status the more apathetic or less sentient (Like the bestial appearance theory above) they act. An example for this is the creation trio from Sinnoh. With their godlike status they may not care about mortal problems or, Uxie, and Azelf are used to control the trio and hold them back and one can conclude 1 of 2 things from this: 1) their powers are very hard for them to control and need the lake spirits to help them. Or 2) The lake spirits serve as both their mind or as a representation of both what humans need and what they lack ( In a way ) and as a buffer for their powers. 2 of the movies support this as well (the rise of darkrai and Giratina and the sky warrior).

In the case of many legendary pokemon they also seem to be very apathetic towards the problems the cause on poke-earth. A good example for this is Dialga and Palkia in the rise of Darkrai. They practically destroy the town and ( Temporarily ) ""kill"" Darkrai. When they finally stop them from battling ash and dawn have to freaking beg Palkia to return it to how it was (It can be argued that it was going to do this anyway and that the town was technically not being destroyed

I realize there are exceptions like mew, etc. but in general the legendary pokemon seem to follow these rules. 

EDIT: after thinking this through more I have some rules for the exceptions:

1) If psychic type or dark type

2) Size seems to matter in intelligence as well with smaller being high intelligence (Usually).

3) Many of the exceptions can still be very bestial in their nature

I've always been wondering about the state of all the Gym Leaders. I mean

Now, you don't even need to read the signs, just look at the roofs.

This is all I am saying: the reason there appears to be no governing body in the game is because the government fully condones and supports the battling of pokemon.

For each gym badge, and it gets you a little closer to the elite 4.

But why can't you use cut outside of battle anyway? It's not like you're going to get arrested just because you don't have the gym badge.. Or is it?

All Gym leaders have to do is sit around in their office (gym) and battle. Instead of paying their own prize money out of pocket

The badges are essentially a level on your Trainer's licence. All pokemon abilities outside of battle are regulated by the government. If you want to cut down smaller trees and shrubs

 
I think the government has had a crucial role in all of this. By keeping a majority of the population engaged in what is essentially a sport, for the most part, out of their hair.

I also made a mention about pokemarts. The reason you have to go up to the counter to buy things is because they sell stuff like potions and poke balls over the counter. They're extremely expensive, it can cause problems in the wrong hands. 

Pokeballs are the same way, yes, that can and will cause problems.

It's also the only reason you can't offload your fifty dire hit you picked up off the ground on some random stranger. You're not actually selling it to the pokemart guys

Pokemon Centers I probably shouldn't have to explain- they're free clinics/emergency rooms for pokemon. all they do is heal smaller wounds

I don't want to define the line where side characters like officer Jenny fit in

TL;DR:

Gyms are government regulated to make sure that people who are not licensed pokemon trainers (or really bad licensed ones) can abuse substances like potion or sell them on the black market;

Places like pokemarts are essentially stores that sell regular stuff

Pokemon Centers are like canadian emergency rooms for pokemon (in the sense of universal health care.)",,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/twoyv/not_sure_if_this_has_been_brought_up_or_posted/

1372668120.0,1hezx7,Ash Ketchum: Anime Theories/Explanations,aoiara,79,23,52,"I see a lot of complaint posts about Ash still being 10 or Ash sucking since Pikachu must be at an unspeakable level. So I've come up with some Anime related theories

1. First tackling Ash's age. People say that Ash is still 10. Some say that 1 year passed since his journey began, including various points in the anime, recognizes the league conferences as an annual event. That being said, Ash is able to complete 5 different leagues, which supports a five-year minimum theory, not counting the Orange League or Frontier or whatever else I missed. There was an episode where he celebrated his birthday. In the third movie Pokemon Short, he celebrates his one year anniversary with Pikachu (keep in mind this is still in the Johto region, as he still has his Chikorita, he would be approximately 15 to 16. Not only that, that 3 month wait would be quite significant in his journey...

2. Now I know there's a huge factor that debunks everything I said in #1. In Pokemon BW001, which is, unfortunately, impossible, because he has already celebrated a 1 year anniversary. So, the conclusion here? I guess I can say nothing more than to just stop caring about Ash's age, as he's timeless, that there is some funky time-physics thing going on in the world of Pokemon. 

3. Next I'll explain Pokemon power and levels. First off, who has been through 4 pokemon leagues prior to the Unova league, lost against a seemingly easy-to-beat Pokemon, it's because that Pokemon has been training for its entire life too. Unlike the games, Pokemon are not weak as shit for their entire lives as long as they live near Nuvema town or something. They will level up. Every area in the world will have levels exceeding 100, as well as level 1 Pokemon. So when Pikachu loses, it just means that it was not good enough. Saying that a level 100 Pikachu shouldn't lose to a level 5 Snivy simply doesn't apply here.

4. Pokemon League Conferences. People complain as to why the hell Ash doesn't hurry up and win every single conference, but not the best. He is competing in a world full of skilled Pokemon trainers. You're not going to win first prize in a regional competition just because you compete in a lot of them. Especially since most likely, most of the other contenders have participated in just as many, if not more, competitions as you. 

5. A theory about the Pokemon League Conference: it's a non-professional conference. By winning a conference you have the ability to challenge the elite 4. If you win against one, and an untold number of champions. Some kind of worldwide organization of Pokemon trainers made this happen: top 5 trainers of every region would deserve such a rank. So if you want to be considered a ""global competitor,"" then you would have to be in the elite 4. That's just a global competitor. Then you can complete globally. Think of it like the people who can become good enough to participate in global sports competitions. Then, when you're a champion, think of that like people who can participate in the olympics. The best of the best, but still, you can be the 100th best, if there are 100 regions. Takes things into perspective, but a really good trainer. If Pokemon trainers were tennis players, and he's got time


**TLDR, impossible because he had a 1yr anniversary in Johto, levels don't exist in the anime, ash doesn't win pokemon leagues even though he participated in 4 because everyone else probably has too, and the pokemon league is actually an unprofessional league that fights to put you into the professional world of pokemon trainers.**",,False,t5_2tpgv,True

This is a long post (!!!). Here's a TL;DR: Cubones are probably not Kangaskhans. They are of cause Marowaks, here's the full version:

Introduction to conspiracies :
I trust that you all (deep deep down) know that 8 out of 10 theories in this subreddit, any instance at Game Freak. Neither do I believe them to be what the designers ever intented to express through their games. That doesn't make it any less fun to speculate.. This subreddit is mostly about what is fun, awesome and mysterious, and not so much about the actual likeliness of what you're proposing. This post is in no way ment to crush anybody's dreams, and in the end, you can believe what you want to believe. Being a believer in the theory of the cubone/kangaskhan-relation, you may not want to read on, feel free to skip to section 2.

Many theorists support the theory of Cubone being the child of a deceased Kangaskhan (or one of the 5698 variations hereof). This post explores 1) the possible evidence for this NOT being the case

     Section 1): Why Cubone and Kangaskhan probably aren't related:

There are some suggestions that Cubone is in fact the child of a desieced Kangaskhan. If you don't already know about the official backgound for Cubone

     1.1) Why they may or may not have been thought of as related prior to Gen I:

The most substantial evidence seems to be similarities between the looks of Cubone and of baby Kangaskhan. Judge for yourself, I think. And BTW, sprites aren't anymore original, they just make it more diffucult to determine anything because of technical constrains like low resolution. The colors (assuming the baby change to brown) and body-type I'll give you - please note, however, that it is possible that the beige things on top of the head were originally horns, even though they clearly became ears

Kangaskhan's bluish forehead is featured both on mother and child

(1) A Kangaskhan baby/pre-evolution was planned. This doesn't nesiccarily suggest any connection to Cubone. Most likely

(2) when M' attempts to evolve, also evolve into Rhydon. Along with Rhydon, Kangaskhan is among the very first Pokémon in the game's internal indexing, which is likely why glitch-pokémon evolves into them.

Besides that, including: different types, no particular overlap in move-set, and the fact that this was included in the first Gen:

""Before the player reaches Lavender Town, was protected by its mother. The Cubone escaped, but its mother was killed. As a result, the Marowak's ghost remained in the Pokémon Tower. [...] the player unmasked her with the Silph Scope and subsequently battled her."" See http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Marowak_%28ghost%29 for more info.

This suggests that a MAROWAK gave birth to a Cubone
Some evidense that DOES suggest that the two are related could be that they both share a native australian theme (boomerang- and kangaroo-inspired respectively).

     1.2) Why the theory certainly isn't treated like canon today:

Whether they were once thought of as related by the designers, strong suggestions that they aren't being treated like that today: 

Since breeding were introduced, neither do they share EV yield, abilities or any other stats like that.

Note however that the (Gen I) Stadium pokédex-entry for Kangaskhan stated that the ""[...] female raises its young in its belly pouch for around three years. The young is taken out once it learns to find food."" - strongly suggesting that the species origianlly may have be designed to include males as well.

The R/S/E pokédex-entry for Cubone (""Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a likeness of its mother in the full moon

Besides this, the significanse of this depends on which theory you are a fan of).

An odd thing, Marowak and Kangaskhan are listed in the Jhoto-dex as #209, #210 and #211 respectively. Again, judge for yourself. I personally believe that they were never intended to belong to the same evolution-chain, but that they are in fact related. Just like Pidgey/Pidove or Tauros/Bouffalant (at least that's how I see it).

     Section 2) Why Marowak is still awesome and mysterious.

First some pokédex-entries:

Crystal: ""Somewhere in the world is a cemetery just for Marowak. It gets its bones from those graves.""

HeartGold: ""It has been seen pounding boulders with the bone it carries in order to tap out messages to others.""

And some trivia:

""In the Pokémon Red and Blue beta

These enties suggest, and mourn them for days, sometimes without moving from the spot. On few occations, elephants have been observed dragging the dead body of a fellow elephant (moved post-mortem) for miles to the place where it originally died. This suggests that elephants also somehow finds the place of death to be significan.

I think that Marowak was strongly inspired by this behaviour. Having a cemetery consisting only of Marowak bodies

*A) Type.* First off is Voltorb's type. It is a pure Electric-type. Now, but Voltorb and Electrode stayed pure Electric-types. Why? They are supposedly pokeballs that have somehow spontaneously come to life, which would seem to indicate being composed of metal. This brings me straight to my second point...

*B) Self Destruct.* This is another thing that always irked me. My own headcanon has always been that when a pokemon faints, building from that concept, how is it that Voltorb and Electrode, as a species, has survived at all? Sure, they popped up after the invention of pokeballs, but it still seems like they should have gone to extinction long before they spread

With both those in mind, Voltorb, Koffing, Pineco, Baltoy, and Ferroseed lines, as well as Genesect). 

But, but a living form of energy within a pokeball. Whatever the energy is, it is able to survive the explosion of its ""body"" and either rebuild itself, or ""infect"" another pokeball, allowing it to survive.

2: TMs were originally designed as a means of warfare. They enabled Pokémon to learn more powerful moves and complicated move sets to make them better fighters against other Pokémon.

3: Friendship evolution wasn’t discovered until generation 2. Why? Perhaps generation 1 is too soon after the war. It wasn’t until people made connections and friendships with Pokémon in times of war that they realized how important the bond between Pokémon and Trainer can be

4: Each Pokémon Professor gives you an empty Pokedex

5: For regions that are so close to one another

6: Also regarding a lack of knowledge, Brigette, Bebe, and Amanita have all been given credit for basically discovering the same thing. 

7: It was pointed out in the original Pokemon War Conspiracy that the war explains why towns all have Gyms and Pokecenters but no real forms of entertainment. Newer games have this.

NOTE: MINOR SPOILERS FOR B2/W2 TOWARDS THE END OF THIS POST

Observation 1: Between Johto and Kanto, this leaves only one not included in the first two regions, which is the Dark type. 

Observation 1a: There is still to this day

Observation 1b: There have been, Sydney from Hoenn, and Grimsley from Unova.

Observation 2: There is a clear but interrupted pattern between Johto and Kanto gyms in terms of their sequence of types. Going in order of each gym leader and Elite Four member and their respective types
Rock is weak to water

Water is weak to electric

Electric is resisted by grass

Grass is weak to poison

Poison is weak to psychic

*Here the pattern is interrupted

Fire is weak to ground

*Moving to the Kanto 4*

Ground is weak to ice

Ice is weak to fighting

Fighting has no effect on ghost

*Another interruption*

*Here we transition from Kanto to Johto*

Flying is immune to ground (from the previous gym leader)

Bug is weak to flying

*Another interruption*

Normal is immune to ghost

Ghost is immune to fighting

Steel is weak to fighting

Ice is weak to steel

Dragon is weak to ice

*Interruption

Poison is weak to psychic

Fighting is resisted by poison

Dark is weak to fighting

And finally Lance

There seems to be a pattern in the two Elite Fours, and it's unclear who Agatha would lose to.

In the Johto Elite 4, Poison and Dark. Now the type-relationships are between Fighting, Psychic, Poison, and Dark. Now we have Bruno beating Karen, but losing to Will. Karen beats Will, but loses to Bruno. Koga loses to Will, and Will beats Bruno AND Koga

No type-pattern applies to the Hoenn gyms, being Fighting type. After this, the pattern doesn't apply.

The Hoenn Elite Four have a similar pattern to the Kanto 4, as well as Steven Stone's dual-Rock-and-Steel specialty creates a sort of type-advantage pentagon between all of the Hoenn 4 and their champion. 

This pattern is gone once Wallace replaces Steven in Emerald.

The Sinnoh gyms pull a similar stunt as the Hoenn gyms, it was fighting. For Sinnoh, it's grass).

Once again, but loses to Ground. Ground beats Fire, but doesn't lose to anybody. And Psychic loses to Bug, but doesn't really beat anybody. However, this incomplete pattern can be rectified by noticing that the Sinnoh 4 purposefully include Pokemon that are not of their specialty type, or at least have dual types, such as Aaron's Drapion, and Lucian's Bronzong. Cynthia

Finally, then starts after Elesa.
Electric loses to ground
Ground loses to flying
Flying loses to ice
Dragon loses to ice.

In B2W2, due to the addition of Roxie (whose poison beats Burgh's bug) and the removal of Bryce and being replaced by Marlon, whose water doesn't have any relationship to Drayden's dragon. 

The Unova 4 have the most clear relationship between themselves, Ghost, Psychic, and Fighting have multiple interactions which are roughly even, sometimes even sharing immunities. Alder, the champion in BW, doesn't have a clear specialty, since half of his team has that type. This mixes him in well with the Unova 4. The same cannot be said for Iris in B2W2.

Other interesting observations:

The penultimate gym leader has been of the Ice-type 3 times (Johto

A dragon-type trainer has been the final gym leader twice, we can also observe that there has been a dragon-type specialist in every region/generation.

The specimen type, out of curiosity we used it to develop a completely unique DNA strand that produced a chimera.

This chimera was based on an ape, but unfortunately, even with the DNA synthesized we weren't able to create a ""live"" version of it. However, we didn't stop and eventually on a hunch we exposed a Ditto to the DNA. 

The results were amazing. Initially the Ditto had trouble with the artificial DNA, the Ditto became the chimera.

The chimera was an exact match to the simulation. It stood three feet tall. Like other subjects that had been exposed to radiation and an external element, this trend has remained the norm. 

I digress. The fact that we were able to create a new creature using artificial chimera DNA and a Ditto shows promise. We have already begun developing new chimeras and reproducing the original chimera with other Dittos. We'll have to see where this goes after further experiments.

I found this on /r/fantheories and I didn't see it get posted here so I figured I would. All credit goes to /u/HoverboardViking.*

The Pokemon universe is not strange. We live in it. We share the same type of ideology. Our governments and economies are the same. The only real difference is

Why? Take a look at Ash. Ash like every other young person in the Pokemon universe wants to become a Pokemon master. He was raised believing it was what he should want. What child in that world wants to grow up and be a firefighter or work on a farm? Like his father

'Catch 'em all' is the perfect phrase, storing them in Pokemon centers, healing them, traveling from place to place. No one is concerned with growing food, raising animals, learning anything or having any type of real advancement if it is not connected to Pokemon.

The Pokemon world is controlled by Unbridled Capitalism in the worst form: pure monopoly. Ash and every young person plays their role. They bought the dream. 'I wana be the very best

Think about the games, most generic, unoriginal person you could ever conceive; without any actual talent or ability, throwing three Arcanines at you. You beat them all, catch everything, destroy the gyms and at the end, there are the elites with the best Pokemon. What do you do? You buy potions and pp ups and etcs from Silph Co. All the money you earned from battles gets slowly pushed back into Silph.

In truth, lvl them like mad, get 6 Dragonites, storm the world to bits. If you have the money, why not do it? Well, it goes against the idea. The elites of the Pokemon world don't want you to succeed. They want you catching trash Pokemon, lvlin them, most people in the Pokemon universe fail

Much like our own world, to get a good job, to have a good family and nice house. Really, all you need is money. Truly, all you are expected to do is take on debt and keep pushing what money you might skimp and save right back into the hands of the rich and powerful. We don't catch Pokemon, but we catch new cars and possessions left and right.

The Pokemon world is one of government controlled monopolies; or business controlled governments. Is there even a government? It's a world for profit and everything else is of no value.

No value to the teeth. Look at all those poor Pokemon: mythical, interesting. They have existed for as long as people have and more or less the two lived together. In the modern world they are slaves, commodities to be bottled up and turned into moving trophies all for money. Some will even go so far as to catch their ancient gods and order them to fight Weedles. What really is happening is the destruction of the old world, of the myth and purity and spirit that made the world what it once was.

The known universe of pokemon seems to parallel Japan: mountainous volcanic islands

Is there a USA like land where millions of people live in big houses and each one has a Charizard to compare to another person's Charizard?

Is there a France

Is there a Germany

Is there a China like country

Regardless, ready to cave in where it was built on greed, lies, and the destruction of the natural world. It's a world where your evil organization, Team Rocket, isn't really that much worse than yourself. It's a world of capitalism and selfishness.

Arceus did not create all Pokémon. This is just superstition and legend. Pokémon arose naturally. Similarly

Here is what happened. At some point in the future, and when we discovered we could bond with the Pokémon much better than with our own Earth animals.

1350608738.0,11q0sc,Legendary Pokemon reproduce asexually and are not genderless.,The_Bat_Hat,66,16,23,"I’m not sure how much of a conspiracy this is

I was looking through some posts about legendary Pokemon in r/pokemon earlier, but I feel like we’ve overlooked another possibility: they reproduce asexually. [Parthenogenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis) is a mechanism by which [invertebrates and some vertebrates]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Natural_occurrence) can reproduce asexually, so why not legendary Pokemon? They seem to be solitary creatures (I don’t think anyone’s ever seen a flock of Zapdos or a pack of Suicune), and this mode of reproduction doesn’t require any contact between members of a species; in fact, it could allow for only one or two members of that species to exist simultaneously (a parent and child, for instance). Some animals can reproduce both sexually and asexually [(like aphids)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid#Reproduction), but there are those that have lost the ability to reproduce sexually and have become locked into the asexual model [(like Bdelloid rotifers)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdelloidea). Couldn’t this be the case with legendary Pokemon?

Asexual reproduction can produce diploid (two sets of chromosomes) females [(thelytoky)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelytoky) or haploid (one set of chromosomes) males [(arrhenotoky)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenotoky), female offspring may or may or may not be full clones of their mother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Types_and_mechanisms). 

So let’s say that evolution (in terms of gradual population change, sterility in the haploid males was heavily selected for (perhaps sterile male drones were a greater aid to the survival of the species than fertile males). Eventually, the ability of (what we now refer to as) legendary Pokemon to reproduce sexually was lost entirely (with exception, namely Manaphy). This is why putting a legendary Pokemon in the Daycare Center with a Ditto fails to produce any eggs. Ditto can transform into said legendary Pokemon, but in doing so, it perfectly mimics that Pokemon’s anatomy, so that neither it nor the original have the means to breed with one another. 

Cresselia provides a good example of this mode of reproduction. Cresselia’s gender ratio is 100% female. This fits perfectly with the model of asexual reproduction I’ve described above. In parthenogenesis, so a 100% female gender ratio poses no problems at all, and actually serves to strengthen support for the asexual reproduction of legendary Pokemon.

This brings me to the issue of gender. As far as I know, it may simply be that the study of Pokemon genetics and reproduction are not yet very well developed, after all it was only thirteen years ago (going off of the Japanese release date of Gold and Silver) that Pokemon researchers/scientists figured out that leaving a male and a female Pokemon alone together resulted in little babies. As subsequent games were released, more and more was shown to be understood about Pokemon genetics and reproduction: breeding rates; egg groups and egg moves; inheriting stats, natures, and abilities; and breeding for shininess. Research into Pokemon genetics and reproduction may simply not yet have advanced far enough to explain much beyond the straightforward “male + female = baby” model of reproduction. Currently unable to understand reproduction via parthenogenesis, they fall back on saying that legendary Pokemon are genderless. A second possibility is that these legendary Pokemon are hermaphroditic. [Sequential hermaphrodites]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_hermaphroditism) can change from [male to female]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_hermaphroditism#Protandry) or [female to male]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_hermaphroditism#Protogyny), since the study of Pokemon genetics and reproduction seems to be a young science at this point in time

Admittedly, my second explanation of the potential gender status of legendaries conflicts with my theory of their reproduction via parthenogenesis, since hermaphroditic organisms tend to mate, rarely reproducing through self-fertilization (and parthenogenesis happens in the absence of fertilization). There is another issue with my theory in that it doesn’t effectively explain Pokemon like Arceus, Dialga, or Palkia (just examples, I know there are others). These types of legendary Pokemon seem to be more than just extremely rare Pokemon with quirky modes of reproduction

Or maybe I’ve spent far too much time sitting here analyzing a game marketed at ten-year-olds. ^^^^Just ^^^^kidding

Also, the X in its eyes just look cyborg-y to me and the white glowing parts on its legs, chest and face look like tron lines. I think it will be Psychic/Electric, Faerie/Electric

3. Yveltal has exposed veins or a nervous system on its body, rubbery skin. Its claws also look strange, like a mad scientist added them. Dark/Flying type, so it and Xern will be perfectly balanced

""Originally developed by Jordan Lanea, stores Poké Balls on an offsite location.

The process in which Poké Balls are stored is an interesting one. First and foremost, a space on the MASSIVE grounds of ""Lanea Ranch"" is opened up for that Trainer. A Trainer can only have a maximum of six Pokémon on them at a given time which is logged whenever a Pokémon is captured and when Pokémon are transferred from party to storage. All excess Pokémon are transported via an improved form of replicated Apricorn energy conversion via the PokéWatch and Pokémon Center PC teleporters. These Poké Balls then arrive at the Trainer's storage box on Lanea Ranch and are logged in their account.

The method of transferring Pokémon back to their Trainers is slightly different. At every Pokémon Center and other choice locations, the Trainer can view their stored Pokémon and swap them out using the PC's built in teleporter, use a public video phone, log their personal journal, and view their earned ""Achievements"".""

I think the reason for this is pokemon certification.

You see, after which we can assume trainers go on journeys around the regions. So If a 10 year old caught a pidgey, he could go flying around anywhere he wanted. This would open up infinite possibilities for everyone. In the 10 year old's case, the only danger would be his own safety. But say, a 30 year old trainer catches a flying pokemon. He could go do anything illegal he wanted, ie stealing, etc. with little fear of getting caught

So the Government(?) of the Pokemon regions came up with the concept of HM and Gym Badges.

Obtaining a gym badge shows that you are a capable trainer, etc). Basically, you are being certified by the gyms as being capable enough to travel in these ways and your gym and travel experiences show that you will be able to bear the burden of these added powers of your Pokemon and not commit any crimes, ie be of strong moral character (though not all, of course)

Before we begin

Porygon is an interesting Pokemon, a computer program.

But if this were true

In short, they decided to go home while the code compiled (which would take quite a while, considering they were basically trying to create life).  When they came back in the morning, they found success!  Not only had a computerized Pokemon been created, but it was sitting in the real world!

What really happened was this:  A Ditto, and became one.

Sylph tried to reproduce Porygon, rather than admitting the rather accidental nature of Porygon, they unveiled their 'creation' and included a falsified story of a Sylph code in Porygon's programming that prevents copying.

So how does this Pokemon evolve? [As previously explained] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/166dgo/ditto_theory_part_iv_trading_and_the_everstone/), for instance, an Onix and a Metal Coat will combine to form a Steelix, Sylph programmers had an idea.  They had been trying, again unsuccessfully, to create a code to induce evolution in Porygon, which they imaginatively called an Up-Grade.  However, they could not manipulate its data enough to make it accept the code.  So

So basically, rather than being simply obsessed with winning pointless battles.

Does it really make sense to give a 10-year-old a dangerous animal and tell him to go fight other people with dangerous animals

However, or a means to an end. We know there's been a war in Kanto, that much is pretty much certain. But a war over what? Exactly what is scarce in the pure, perfect world of Pokemon? Pokemon themselves, of course.

Now, like Rattata, who aren't very valuable and indeed are mostly used by kids and criminals (surely too poor to afford or catch rarer pokemon). But there are also the ""legendary"" ones, like Zapdos (hey, I'm old), that are coveted by everyone, that *no one else* has caught, much like Mammoths, Pokemon have existed *forever*

So vermin is very common, are so rare, they cannot be found in the wild. But society needs them, they use them more than technology, for everything from power generation to fire hydrants (water pokemon). Thus the  trainers, leagues, “champions” (after only a day or two of work), frankly, see Cubone's mother).

**Real meat**:
Now here's the real meat of this: Most everyone in Pokemon, but think about how many fucking Zubats you've encountered. They are everywhere, but you, Red, don't even kill them to save your own life. Probably because Red's been told all Pokemon are precious (they really are), and perhaps because, deep down

The adults are key here. 1) Most adults are happy to cheerfully write you off or mock you (with their canines of supposedly mass destruction pointed at you). As if they know something you don't. As if your whole purpose in life (at age *fucking 10*) was not something to be taken seriously. They know. They know it's all a trick, janitors. They're still happy to do their part to save the Pokemon (carry balls to fight kids), who are so dangerously close to extinction, but only the most hardcore become part of it, much like only the most serious eco-friendly person will actually make a career out of it. 2) We know from Black 2 that leaders (adults) are *not* using their real Pokemon, because after you beat the (10-year-old easy) elite 4, the goal is not to win anymore, you've reached the end of the Plastic Labyrinth

Pokemon are very serious. Being a trainer actually isn't, people are actually *concerned* about how seriously Hugh is taking this ""purpose in life"" thing. Also, people are also obsessed about the bond between people and their Pokemon because while there is always time for them to get stronger, they must be acquainted with humans in order to be truly useful to them... Plus they make good pets.

Now, a lot of rare pokemon thrive in cities). Perhaps everyone is so goddamn friendly and everything is so goddamn nice because it's built that way. That would explain why no one gives a shit that you're travelling deep into “dangerous” caves (that supposedly no one has visited before even though there's Potions and shit lying around everywhere). The rarer the Pokemon, the greater it is, and boy do they drive that point home, with the binoculars, the books, the legends... That would also explain why travelling is so goddamn restricted, and they don't want you introducing your PMD into real

Oh and finally, like we're currently trying to revive mammoths (if mammoths could make your fucking tea). They do it on site, much easier, and there are many people with weapons-grade animals to contain the mess if something goes awry... Which it inevitably does.

So yeah, until you've done your part (unwittingly), and gathered enough extinct species to deserve the truth about them. Perhaps Pokedexes double up as tracking devices? Perhaps Profs are just managers? (They certainly care the most about Pokemon... and why do they have so much authority?) Perhaps someone profits... I'm open to suggestions. Perhaps I should go to bed.

1. Besides through the use of moves such as Metronome Sketch, Me First, etc. Mew and Ditto are the only pokémon able to use Transform

2. Let's assume Ditto is a failed Mew clone

3.  The fact that Mew has the DNA of every Pokémon in existence

Now, it gets into a certain state, which, by the way, is very similar to a same state that can be seen when it is [getting out of the pokéball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZY3H613jo&amp;t=0m28s).

Both states are also similar to the state Ditto gets into [when it transforms into another Pokémon](http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xp24ua?start=317). So

1. Mew gave origin to other pokémon by transforming into them and breeding. Thus I guess the original pokémon wasnt ONE Mew
2. The other pokémon, being it the *transform state*, as it can be seen in the evolution process and the capture process

4. Pokéballs are able to store pokémon when they are in the *transform state*, which is possible because he created them with this same power 
5. The powers of Transform explain why pokémon ""create"" clothes for themselves when they evolve
6. Pokémon that may evolve by merging with others, explaining why you can find underleveled evolved pokémon in the wild.

On the process of capture and evolution:

1. After gaining enough experience points
2. In order to be stored in a poké-ball, and that's why the pokémon's powers are hindered, as said by Cyrus.
3. Because of #2 is that why you can capture god-like creatures but you aren't able to use their godly powers at their best.

The mother, and the other will be more intelligent and resourceful. This will always happen. The mother watches over the twins as they develop basic motor skills and perceptional senses over the course of a few months. All is well because the infants are small and can both fit comfortably in her pouch. 

The seasons change, but is adept at using a weapon (the bone) in combat resourcefully. If the baby Kangaskhan is smart enough, it will use its intellect to escape its mother and brother/sister. 

The intelligent Kangaskhan, in hope that something will help it. This is why you never see the abandoned young Kangaskhan: it is clever and knows how to hide itself. It is hungry and malnourished, and will die soon if it does not find food. A rogue Marowak discovers the child and takes it under its own care--providing it with food, shelter, and love. The child grows to Cubone's size and is able to call the Marowak its parent, even if it is not, because of the love it is providing. Marowak teaches the young Kangaskhan how to fight with a weapon and survive over, a year. But Marowak do not live long in the wild; their life expectancy increases drastically only when a trainer obtains and takes care of it

The surrogate parent Marowak dies in its sleep, the Kangaskhan realizes that it must survive. It takes the parent's skull, remembering how the parent would nuzzle it, and the humerus, remembering the arms that held and comforted it. Kangaskhan promises itself never to remove or abandon the last of his mother he can hold on to, and, now becoming what we call ""Cubone""

If a trainer does not find and capture the wandering Cubone, but its mind is never healed. It feels the burden of leaving the mother's corpse behind, and remembers how it was almost eaten by its mother as a child. Because its mind has not fully matured, Cubone blames it on its ""better"" twin, the one who was chosen by the mother Kangaskhan to survive. Infuriated that it must now live a life of solitude and despair, the angry Cubone trains itself, growing much stronger and much

Using its natural instinct and enlightened sense of hunting from Marowak, Cubone spies on the pack of Kangaskhan. Cubone notices that he is not the only one to have experienced his mother trying to eat him, as he witnesses several other mother Kangaskhan do the same. Angered, Cubone is determined to find its mother and, smelling an almost familiar smell, is able to. Cubone spies obsessively on the family he never had, eyeing its twin with pure hatred and jealousy. Because the brawny twin Kangaskhan is now old enough to start going off on its own, taking out all the jealousy and anger it previously had. Leaving the body behind, alerting the rest of her pack to her massacred child's remains. The rest of the Kangaskhan become overly protective of the young they didn't eat (the origin of Kangaskhan's obsessive behavior with its child). 

Eventually, either because of its brute, Kangaskhan nature or because it wants to honor and hold on to the twin it defeated, will remove the skull of the brawny twin (this skull is more comfortable, as the twin was the same size as Cubone...also, this is why Marowak's ""helmet"" doesn't look as crappy as Cubone's) and puts Marowak's skull on the ground next to the twin.

Desensitized, was left alone when its Marowak mother died, had to carry its mother's remains alone (which it still does), and murdered its brawny twin Kangaskhan in cold blood (and took his remains as well), Marowak punishes itself by malnourishment and sometimes even starvation, leading to its early death. But it is not done yet.

With the knowledge that other Kangaskhan children are experiencing what Marowak once experienced, continuing the Kangaskhan--Cubone--Marowak cycle successfully.

If a trainer caught the Cubone, Cubone uses its mother's bone to thin the skull it wears, smoothing and filing it to make it look the way Marowak's skull helmet looks. Marowak, in this case, would live to lvl 100 because it has all the necessary skills to survive and never has to go through killing its twin, therefore being happier. Theoretically, if one were to catch Marowak in the wild (which i cant remember if thats possible or not), but the Marowak would learn to forget all that had already happened

The Day Care centers across the world know this cycle, keeping one for themselves or perhaps a ""Lost Twin Trainer"" somewhere else, and giving the other egg to you.

TL;DR: Cubone was seen by its Kangaskhan mother as the inferior of the mother's twins. It ran away and was adopted by a Marowak that experienced the same thing. Marowak dies after teaching the inferior child survival skills. Cubone takes the adopted parent's skull and bone and hunts down and kills its superior twin. Becoming Marowak after taking the superior twin's skull, which makes it die young.

By this logic everyone who has been a trainer for around 10 years should have a full team of Lvl 100s but 

There are two possible explanations that i can think of 

Coming to think of it it could be a mixture of the two as after beating the champion ( which we will say is a sort of proving ritual ) trainers may be given the option the option to : a) release all these pokemon that they have formed a strong emotional bond with or b) be sent to battle frontier to live until they choose option A watching their beloveds be K.Oed again and again with no progression 

just a thought I had while playing heart gold so its a work in progress

Also the reason your player doesn't have to face this horrifying choice could be because you are performing valuable research for the professor of your region and are deemed to useful by the apparently horrifyingly cruel pokemon government (Although I suppose this is less horrifying than a world in which everyone has god like powers at their disposal )

Possible Supporting Theory 1: All Pokemon were contrived as weapons and the world was ravaged by a bio-weapon war

Possible Supporting Theory 2: Animals quickly mutated due to some other unforeseen event. They can now rapidly reproduce and out compete conventional animals, leading to the possible armagedon situation, where the few humans left had no reason to keep history and so the history of the world before was destroyed.

Both of these theories would support the advanced technology in the Pokemon world. Pokeballs were derived from a control device that was once used to either try to control the population of Pokemon or to control Pokemon for use in the war.

Some additional evidence comes from the [mention of conventional animals](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Animals_in_the_Pok%C3%A9mon_world) in the anime

The Pokemon's High reproduction rate does not mean that they have shorter life spans. We see most live alongside people for most of their lives

We've all heard of the theory about how the Pokedex is written by children

In the first games, and they are then set on their way. It can therefore be assumed that the data that is recorded by the Pokedexes in the first Generation games are either local storage only, or their data banks are kept only by the Professor, and maybe accessed by other Professors. 

In the later generations, usually by Professors, to many different trainers. Even by the second Generation, there are likely many more trainers with Pokedexes, each possessing new information.

Here comes the kicker: why? What use does an encyclopedia serve if the information is only given up after the pokemon is caught? The most obvious answer is that the protagonists themselves are filling in the information

I instead posit a counter-theory: the Pokedexes, worried about his grandson and his grandson's best friend, gives them a device that tracks their whereabouts, records what kinds of creatures they have seen, and relays this back to him. He is thus able to keep a check on them (which also explains why his aides pop up ahead of you in the games). 

However, and perhaps scientists, to track their children), but also act as a kind of personal forum for the trainers. As new pokemon are encountered, the trainers can see what other people have learned about the same pokemon. When rare finds are discovered, it's more or less a bonus.

And, why not unlock all the entries at once? Wouldn't that make traveling easier for the trainers?

The answer that I come up with is that the ""adventuring"" part of a trainer's life is to prime them for adulthood. It is, both Cheren and Bianca learn what they want to do in life from the lessons they learned while traveling. 

(Certainly, archaeologists, breeders, Rangers, cameramen and more. You do find some trainers who are specifically trying to get better at battling (Ace Trainers), but most have already decided upon other avenues. However, this is a tangent and a theory for another post.) 

The Pokedex can thus be seen as a part of that rite of passage. It is a recording of the child's journey, the entries might not be exact, but they fuel the imagination and foster a desire to learn more.

In Black 2 and White 2

Another untold story is that of the Abyssal Ruins. Now a while ago before Black 2 and White 2 were announced, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem’s numbers in the National Pokedex.

“King defeated ③ alone.④ joined King in a day.King called ⑤ beings.King is hope and future.The great King ⑥.”

Which read

King defeated Reshiram alone.
Zekrom joined King in a day.
King called Landorus beings.
King is hope and future.
The great King Kyurem.


However

King defeated Zekrom alone.
Reshiram joined King in a day.
King called Landorus beings.
King is hope and future.
The great King Kyurem.

There is no doubt in my mind that this was intentional and that the first two numbers are related to Zekrom

Side Note: N is Team Plasma’s King in Black and White

Now that Landorus beings part is interesting. This would refer to the entire Kami trio of course

In the Japanese versions

Due to his status as the being who dominates Agriculture

If the King was the winning brother, teamed up with his dragon, and called down the Sacred Kami Trio to clean up the mess from their fighting. Tornadus and Thundurus would put out fires and clean up wreckage, and Landorus would re-fertilize Unova wherever it was no longer possible for wild-life and plant-life to live.

On top of this, which changes the Kami trio into their therian formes, rested in the Abyssal Ruins. In Black 2 and White 2, it was stated that in the time they were revered and ""caused trouble"", they were in their therian formes, supporting the winning brother summoning them and transforming them to clean up the aftermath of the war.

Side Note: I have no real good interpretation of how to fit “King Kyurem” into this. I’m just including that from that first theorist’s interpretation.

I’d also like to note that Cobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion randomly showed up in Black 2 and White 2 in the wild, as they hate war.

Now back to my earlier point.

The Abyssal Ruins and the Relic Castle were Castles each ruled by the brothers in the myth in Black and White. Like I mentioned before

Since this castle praises its king, is found in the Nacrene museum, which was excavated from the Relic Castle.

Now the Winner’s dragon you would expect to be in the Abyssal Ruins, or a piece of it. Now I bet you’re thinking, why would the castle be there and why are there no ruins? Well I stumbled upon one of the most subtle things ever. Dragonspiral tower looms over the town where the ice gym was located in Pokemon Black and White.

What do you think of when you hear Dragon and Ice? Supereffective? WRONG! In reference to the story anyways, Reshiram and Zekrom.

The two brothers fought and the Winner would go on to rule Unova from that central castle, where the DragonSpiral Tower now stands and the loser's dragon would end up in the desert to later be discovered by the Nacrene museum in the form of the Dark/Light Stone.

    Side note: Slightly solidified that the winning dragon’s master was of the Abyssal Ruins. In Black 2 and White 2 you are given notes written by Ghetsis that decipher the Abyssal Ruins’ text for you, according to my theory, ends up in DragonSpiral Tower, where N receives it.

Now in Lacunosa town, and that’s how the brothers found the Original Dragon and used it to rule Unova. After the split, the body(Kyurem) returned to the only other place it knew, the landing site of its comet.

Kyurem was mistakenly believed to be eating people as it would lure people in to the Giant Chasm and task them with trying to ressurect Reshiram and Zekrom for him to fuse with. This could be why Ghetsis went on this crazy quest. Assuming he’s from Lacunosa town,,False,,t5_2tpgv,False,,True
1350520263.0,11ntwa,The PokemonSetting is actually an aritifical dome which serves as a T.V. show watched by billions of fans,kennyguy123,82,39,15,"This post draws heavily from elements of the Truman Show


**Background**

The pokemon world takes place in a highly advanced, but it didn't make up for replacing their natural habitats for huge cityscapes that look kind of like Castelia City.
As a result, created man-made caves, and even filled in giant swimming pools to create oceans, all for the existence of the remaining pokemon. These were large domes, but they were incredibly expensive, so in order to make this endeavor profitable, they created a TV show around one boy in his quest to train and battle pokemon and eventually rise to become the best. Cameras are everywhere in the dome



**Geography of the domes**


Highly sophisticated towns were created for the sake of the show, as you'll find huge gaps between cities that contain only grass, water, and mountains. This seems kind of too perfect to me, as the technology in Pokemon is clearly incredibly advanced, but they don't go beyond the a certain area limit in each city to create more buildings. They probably also don't create more buildings because the population is static, as everyone is an actor.

This is especially obvious in the Unova region, there is a wall that prevents you from going into areas that go past the map, fitting into the whole dome theory.
To fit into the show

I also found it weird that pokemarts exist outside of Safari's. The Pokemon World itself is practically a safari for people to catch pokemon



**The NPCs in the show**


Everyone hired to play as the background cast are always willing to help out the main character. Simply by just talking to them, and rods at you, encouraging you along your journey in the T.V. show. The way Alder, previous Pokemon Champion, leaps off the little mountain seems like he was scripted to talk to you as you've only just begun your journey. The reporter and cameraman you meet are never facing each other, and in fact, are only looking in one single direction, Blue

Other than you're rival
Red was a main character that realized the true nature of the Pokemon World, in order to keep the Kanto region productive, they allowed the Jhoto main character to cross into Kanto.



**Level disparity amongst Pokemons**


Every chosen main character always seems to be starting off at the weakest town with the weakest areas of Pokemon. This seems to be the biggest hint at a dome/scripted world. All the grass areas where Pokemon pop up are neatly kept at the same level, Every gym is specifically installed to challenge you with pokemon in you're level range, as it gives the show the sense of progression and challenge.


The villains in the region are specifically put in place to give the main character an adversary that will make the show exciting. They probably don't actually steal pokemon, and you're never going to find any trainer, with pokemon outside your level group. It's also noteworthy you won't find any pokemon trainers in the towns, cities, or near the Pokemon centers, which you think it would be packed with.



**Pokemon affected by Man-made intervention**


Because of how in the past of this world, specifically legendaries, has risen up as guardians that protect the nature /encourage fertility, such as celebi, regigigas, manaphy, the lake guardians



**Why?**


Breaking the flow of the conspiracy here, people would definitely watch the story of one boy rising up to become a Pokemon Master as it would remind them of simpler times when the world wasn't so chaotic. From the point-of-view of you, the main character, the world of Pokemon is a quest that only you seem to be involved in. From the point-of-view of the audience, it will be a story that will give you the ultimate feels as everyone would wish they could go back and fix the destruction they caused.

We all have plenty of experience with Pokéballs

* There are two halves to a Pokéball

* They can be separated into two halves

* There are three main kinds, there are Pokéballs created from Apricorns and there is a rare, limited kind of Pokéball known as the Master Ball, which cannot fail at capturing a Pokémon

* To capture a Pokémon

* Pokéballs are capable of containing Pokémon many thousand times larger and heavier than the ball itself

* Pokéballs function indiscriminantly: the Pokémon itself cannot say 'no', good job Minccino and Psyduck) in the anime, but it doesn't give them the choice to say no

* Pokéballs, although a Pokéball is used as an item icon in the overworld for the games.

* Pokéballs are produced by Silph Co.

Now

The Pokéball, which summoned a Pokémon, but this is not absolute as the only place this has been shown is in Pokémon 4ever, and we won't be referring to this as canon (the anime doesn't, so why should we?)

At some point, concepts like ""Trainers"" and ""Co-ordinators"" came into existence, and Pokéballs developed along with these people.

Now. Look at the [Pokéballs](http://www.google.co.jp/imgres?imgurl=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0JgMCR7jqt0/UHXR_CMFF5I/AAAAAAAAAPc/50yLyHyTHs4/s1600/Pokeballs_yet_more_models_by_BionicleGahlok.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://skysiez.blogspot.com/2012/10/awesome-real-life-pokeballs.html&amp;h=768&amp;w=1024&amp;sz=288&amp;tbnid=etMVUDSMh3bdeM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=120&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__gm1w829F-dpf4_2xQ-pfCmpDErI=&amp;docid=FQbtTLKH5GavqM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zeexUbe4D4imkwX-h4DACA&amp;ved=0CDkQ9QEwAQ&amp;dur=1776). Apart from the Cherish Ball, an anime exclusive to justify Ash's travels through the Orange Islands, all Pokéballs are mainly white on the bottom. The main difference between them all lies in the top half; this indicates that the bottom is an essential compartment to a Pokéball. I believe that this is the part that enables the containing of Pokémon.

The top half includes all the technical aspects to the capturing of the Pokémon

import PokemonPolitics.*;

Back a long time ago, the government(s) subsidized development of the Pokeballs and the accompanying PC storage system. Why?

-Pokeballs made ownership of a Pokemon much easier. You can just weaken it and throw a ball instead of having to befriend it the old-fashioned way. And unlike an Apricorn, on the other hand, are relatively rare, and can only be made into Pokemon storage devices by the work of a skilled craftsman.

-To regulate Trainers. As it became easier to own Pokemon, the E4 could at least catch major discrepancies. Also, the Pokemon belonging to criminals could be ""frozen"" (like a bank account) so as to prevent the criminals using them. Going off this, this could explain why a lot of Team Rocket members only have a few Pokemon. In fact, to the best of my memory, almost none of them had 6. By only keeping a few Pokemon, they wouldn't have to use the PC system

-Research purposes. The regional Professor would be able to gain a lot of useful data by observing trends about which Pokemon are caught

-It helped the economy. More Pokeballs meant more domesticated Pokemon and Trainers, TM/HM sales, Move Tutors, Daycare/Breeding, more jobs for Pokemon Centers, etc.

So that's why the government subsidized Pokeballs and oversees the PC network. True, and using the PC system to monitor activity might at least force big-time criminals to move their gains in a less-efficient manner.

Where does Team Rocket come into this? Team Rocket's stated goal is domination through Pokemon. They have many times attempted to gain Pokemon to use. (They also tried to presumably capture the Master Ball, I've already stated my idea that the reason the League is isolated, guarded by tough Pokemon and the best trainers, is because the final room holds the mainframe of the PC network.) Part of the plan was for their leader, Giovanni, to gain control of the Viridian Gym as a staging ground. Once Team Rocket had finished their preliminary buildup of troops, they would gather quietly at Viridian Gym. They could either pass through Victory Road, they would quickly seize the League, they truly could have taken over the world.

However, and stole the valuable Silph Scope, which could have been used to capture Ghost Pokemon to counter Agatha's. He rescued Mr. Fuji, who could have given then Pokemon to use, or helped train theirs. He defeated them at Silph, and took the Master Ball so they couldn't. Even with all these setbacks, Giovanni was still going to try to take the League. And then guess what happened? Red shows up at Viridian, even after all their operations had been wrecked by this kid. But with their forces defeated

The kicker? After all this, you're going to have to go through me."" Red has the talent to become Champion, the morals of an Eagle Scout, and the dedication of a pianist. He takes the Championship not for his own fame, but to use his power and his team for good; to make sure that he will be standing in Team Rocket's way. Red claiming the title of Champion, and their subsequent defeat in the Sevii Isles, are the final nails in Team Rocket's coffin. After making sure Team Rocket is finished in Kanto, and goes off to Mt. Silver.

He's not just on vacation. Red is a true hero - one who doesn't want fame or power, once he saw the threat was eliminated, he left to live in peace - but he didn't go far. At Mt. Silver, he's still in contact with League Members. If there's any hint of Team Rocket threatening the Indigo Plateau again, then he'll be ready to come out of retirement.

After being defeated by Gold

-End Credits roll-

Summary: Pokeballs let the E4 regulate the region and help the economy, and Gold becomes his Robin.

1352150999.0,12otfc,How Pokéballs “control” Pokémon: Survival and Choice in the PKMN world [x-post from r/pokemon],Wolvenfire86,57,8,13,"A while back

If a Pokéball was real, can heal an organism when attached to a Pokémon center and teleports from point A to B when you have more than six Pokémon on your persona. But even when suspending disbelief, mind control via technology is still a very difficult feat for a piece of machinery that is sold cheap to the general public. 

So we talked and talked and I think we figured out how a Pokéball can make a Pokémon instantly loyal to who ever traps it in that ball.

Our conclusion: **it doesn’t.** The Pokémon stays of its own freewill.

Say you are a wild Pokémon. You live in a forest with hundreds of other “competing” Pokémon. You’re most likely un-evolved, water, shelter and other Pokémon of the same species, you also have to fend off different Pokémon that may want to eat you or are territorial.

In addition to the weather, you stay paralyzed (see Entei, Raikou Suicune).

*Then* consider reproduction. Pokémon of a higher level are more likely to survive, attract the opposite sex, mate, fend of predators, protect its young and live longer. But leveling up in the wild is hard. You all know it’s easier to level-grind by battling other trainers than wild Pokémon. Even with the benefits of EV training, it takes forever.

In short

As a wild Pokémon

Then one day, and orders it to attack you. *This* Pokémon is tougher than anyone in the forest and has his sights set on you. He kicks your ass, but doesn’t kill you. Maybe he’s showing off how strong he is? The human throws a ball at you and you get sucked inside. You try to break free, as anyone would, but eventually it closes up and doesn’t open again. You are injured. You think death is coming.

One trip to the Pokémon Center and suddenly

The human doesn’t eat you. Instead, heals you every time you get hurt, and gives shows you (holy shit, what?!) kindness and compassion. *And* you’re hanging out with five other Pokémon that are pretty chill, unlike that douche Ivysaur.

In return, fainting sucks, but he saves you when that happens. No one eats you whilst you’re unconscious.

He never abandons you

We (my pal and I) figured that the Pokéball merely encases the Pokémon

We reasoned that at first, then respects the trainer, then likes him/her, then sees the trainer as family.

If you look at Pokémon like they are animals, significantly more likely to live longer, able to breed multiple times in a non-threatening environment, are safer than they would be in the wild, and can learn attacks that they would never learn on their own (via TMs/HMs).

[This article here](http://www.aolnews.com/2009/11/06/did-we-domesticate-dogs-or-did-dogs-domesticate-us/) suggests that dogs came into human culture because they saw the advantages of living in civilization. The same is implied for cats (who use us every day and cat owners know this) and other species we have domesticated. *They* came to *us*

You’re Pokémon may see you as a savior from the difficult life of being in the wild. And the Pokéball is not a brainwashing

So

**TL;DR:** A Pokéball merely registers a Pokémon

**Edit:** Pokémon that evolve based on their friendship level add to this theory.

Second, you'll be able to learn a few things you hadn't, and form some neat theories with this information. Anyways, let's begin!

*300 Million Years Ago*

This time period is one of the two major times, and the beginning of the Permian Period. During this time, giant arthropods ruled the lands, and amphibians were beginning to become dominant on land. Important to note is that just 5 Million Years earlier, a great mass extinction even known as the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse happened, causing most of the forests and animals on Earth at the time to disappear. What rainforests remained were on small islands, and due to the climate changing to be dryer

Only Three Pokemon (Two Families) were known to exist during this time period.

* Kabuto
* Kabutops
* Genesect

Pretty interesting isn't it? Now, including their time periods. So, assuming this theory was true, then that would make **The Kabuto Family the oldest known Pokemon in existence, not counting mythological Pokemon.**

Now, and extremely deadly. Perhaps this was so Pokemon could carve there niche into the ecosystem, allowing for more Pokemon to evolve later? I'll leave that for you guys to speculate on, as it's time to move onto our next major time period in Pokemon.

*100 Million Years Ago*

A large time difference between the last time period, as well as Triceratops, and Velociraptor. Also notable in this time is that Flowering Plants and Grass began to appear. Yup, we didn't have grass before this time period. The More you know! Landmasses were slowly drifting and resembling the world we know today, with some differences. With 35 Million Years till the end of the Cretaceous Period, and Dinosaurs in General, there'll be plenty of time for Pokemon to thrive during this time period!

Only 9 Pokemon (5 Families) were known to be alive during this time period.

* Lileep
* Cradily
* Cranidos
* Rampardos
* Shieldon
* Bastiodon
* Tirtouga
* Carracosta
* Relicanth

Plenty of variation here huh? Here we see a lack of Arthropod Pokemon

*10

Again, Saber Tooth Tiger, and Giant Ground Sloth. Amongst these creatures, a sole Pokemon joins them.

* Mamoswine

Odd huh? This Pokemon isn't in fossils, only Mamoswine. Did they and we just don't know, or did Mamoswines grow to become Piloswines, and having them know ancient power reverts them to become like their ancestors. If that theory is true, then did Yanmega and Tangrowth exist in the past too?

Now I'm sure you've noticed that some iconic Fossil Pokemon were not listed here. What Pokemon do we know existed in ancient times, but not exactly when.

* Shellder
* Cloyster
* Omanyte
* Omastar
* Aerodactyl
* Anorith
* Armaldo
* Archen
* Archeops

First of all, so it's interesting to know that Shellder (And presumably Cloyster) has been around for such a long time and as far as we know isn't changed from what is was so many years ago. Just how long ago? We don't know, we do know however it was around at the same time Omastar was.

Aerodactyl was said to be alive during the age of Dinosaurs, perhaps other fossil sets would be alive at the same time as their counterparts? This would make sense if it weren't for Aerodactyl, who as alive during Dinosaurs and is in the same Fossil set as Kabutops which as alive waaaay before Dinosaurs appeared.

Note: My playing experience only goes up to Gen 3.

This isn’t really a solid theory

My idea is that each region is a feudally organized country

We’ll start at the top, but they take on tasks that only the greatest trainer of the age could handle. These include the recapturing of Mewtwo, catching certain legendaries such as Kyogre/Groudon to prevent another war of the elements, removing the remainder of Team Rocket from the Sevii Isles, finding out what the hell is going on at the Lake of Rage and similar tasks. The Champion is benevolent dictator, celebrity, and superhero of the region

Next come the Elite Four. These would be the Champion’s lieutenants. Their jobs would include defending the League building, and by somehow making sure the Pokemon in Victory Road (and on the sea routes leading to Evergrande City) are strong enough to at least slow down any organization trying to seize the League and the computers in the final room. The E4 would also take on special missions, such as Loreli, Lance and Wallace did. Finally, the E4 would maintain public services like police, Pokemon Centers, PCs, roads outside of cities

The Gym Leaders are like the lords of their fiefs, and occasionally smaller adjacent towns. Their jobs would basically be the day-to-day jobs of the city, and occasionally other things (Ex. Watson, Jasmine) that need personal attention. Some key, trusted leaders are given the power to dispense HM licenses, which they bundle in with winning the badge.

Trainers usually take one of two paths. The rare one is the Trainer who travels far and wide to become the very best, or Brendan. Far more common are trainers who enter into the service of a Gym Leader, as knights served their lords. These trainers take one of two more paths. Some will stay in the Gym, and train with their leader, also testing those who seek to challenge the Gym. Others are posted around the city. All those trainers on the way to Lilycove or wherever are sentinels and guardians for the city and its Gym Leader. Why do the Gym Leaders keep small armies in and around their cities? Because peace is not a given.

In medieval countries, and fought often, both hot and cold wars. In Pokemon, the cities are similar, with each city carefully guarding its borders by posting trainers on surrounding routes and keeping Gym Trainers to guard the city proper. Some cities can protect themselves by being remote (Cianwood, Dewford, Fortree, Sootopolis, in exchange for favors from Oak. Or

Why do these cities fight? It’s not fighting anymore so much as keeping troops because your neighbor has them, the E4 will step in, but otherwise, cities are on their own (or with their allies). (However, I do like the idea of some of the past wars being civil.)

Ordinary people are almost everyone else. Some non-Trainers work in Pokemon Centers, or with more normal jobs. Others, who have some special skill with Pokemon but can’t/don’t want to become Trainers, will take on jobs like Move Tutors, Daycare/Breeding owners, Battle Tent operators, or special tutors like the Name Rater or Move Deleter. These are the people who bring in visitors, even if they aren’t Trainers. There would also be a few people like Professors

TL;DR: Pokemon lands are like medieval feudal kingdoms. You play as the once-in-a-generation wunderkind of the land. Cities are in a tense standoff constantly. PEACE IS NOT A GIVEN.

Together

Arceus than created Groudon

Arceus than made Kyogre

This displeased Groudon.



&gt;Angry that he was hidden

&gt;He made continents

&gt;Fighting back

&gt;Arceus than created Raquaza



Shocked, Arceus was pleased.

Arceus created Regigigas

And on this Earth

Giratina



&gt;Raquaza, this brought for Shaymin.

&gt;To guard the sea as it slumbered

&gt;From its rest

&gt;Giratina



Giratina

Landorus

Arceus, exhausting Arceus.

Arceus


&gt;Thus

&gt;Diagla create the Celebi as its agents

&gt;Palika, as Palika slumber as well.

&gt;Latios and Latias carried on in their duty.



The Latios and Latias were created shy away from danger and violence

It took them time

Eventually

But the humans were not good enough.



&gt;Hoping adversity would help shape the humans and aid in bonding with the pokemon

&gt;Jirichi summoned Lugia and Ho-Ho. Lugia formed Articuno, Ho-oh brought hope.

&gt;Lugia formed Zapdos, to show beauty from the storm.

&gt;Lugia formed Moltres. With the intense heat, another statue was formed, and life made. Ho-oh did nothing.



The humans, and war broke out.

The humans, seperately.

Colabain

Both the Legendary musketeers and Latias went to a Jirachi



&gt;The Jirachi presented the humans with a box, they would be fine.

&gt;The humans, there was also an egg.

&gt;From the egg came Uxie, who taught the humans true knowledge, emotion, and willpower.

&gt;The Latios and Latias were scared


The humans, Kyurem was born.

Kyurem worked with the humans to advance their society

Together

Eventually



&gt;Unable to seek the wisdom of the elusive Latios and Latias

&gt;Reshiram was born

&gt;After temporary peace

&gt;Kyurem's shell would fall from the sky



Ho-oh saw the way the trainers had acted

Ho-oh created Suicine, from Jolteon.

The trio was to find a trainer pure of heart for Ho-oh.

Ho-oh still awaits.

In Regards to the M01 DNA Experiments:

___________________________________________________________

Mew was the first. The creature was originally thought to be a local folk legend or myth of natives in the Amazon Basin. However

It would be many years before a live specimen was seen. The creature had strange abilities that allowed it to modify its surroundings, and control nature. Continued observations of the creature and research on the DNA of the original remains showed that this creature was not associated with any other life forms on Earth. This Mew, as the natives called it, was an enigma that begged to be investigated. 

Jump ahead two decades. Years of research on the DNA allowed for the manipulation of pre-existing animal life. Early experiments were horrible failures

During this process, was the first rat injected with the M01 DNA. After three days, during which time the creature’s flesh broke out it boils and scabs, Jimmy morphed into something a colleague of mine, we’ll call her Jill, called a Rattata. Afterwards, all rat based test subjects became known under the codename

Further research has also allowed us to create some unexpected results. A mistake involving a turtle triggered a specimen codenamed “Squirtle.”  The subject was left in its terrarium with water in it. A radiation leak in the lab reacted with the test subject during its morph. The end result was the ability for the creature to manipulate water with what we can only deduce is its mind

Since this incident, codenamed “Charmander” and “Bulbasaur,” both reptiles. Charmander was a lizard exposed to intense heat, resulting in the ability to manipulate heat energy, i.e. fire. Bulbasaur was a toad that was exposed to a very invasive form of plant life recently discovered in the Amazon Basin, which to this point seemed to kill all other animals it infected. The result in the experiment was a sort of symbiotic relationship with the plant, allowing the specimen the ability to grow and control vine-like appendages and other plant-like defense and hunting mechanism.  

Obviously, takes the most advantagous features of the creature and amps them up. In the cases of the radiation exposed specimens, it seems capable of even allowing them to control their environments to an extent. This would give them unprecedented survivability in the wild and a clear advantage over non-M01 modified species. 

I can only imagine how Mew utilizes this DNA. From the reports

We first meet a Trubbish on the routes leading out of Nimbasa. But, where, as it is such a large city, likely has much trash. I propose the theory, Trubbish form when a Grimer enters a Trash Bag and either becomes stuck or chooses to stay in the bag, eventually melding to it. After said creation, the Trubbish migrate north, which can easily rupture the plastic shell. 

An alternate theory is that Nimbasa does in fact have Grimer, they take the form of a trash bag to keep in moisture, and therefor, stay in the form. This also explains how other areas have Trubbish and Garbodor, since Grimer likely has no other alternative.

But what of Garbodor and Muk? Surely, he grows. And when trash bags are filled, they stretch or Rupture. Therefore, to hold itself inside, Muk stretches the bag in order to maintain it's form. I support this by using the fact that Garbodor evolves 2 levels earlier than Muk, due to the constraint of the bag keeping Grimer more moist and compact.

In the universe of the Pokemon games, etc. Why would that be? Voltorb could well be a Pokeball come to life, but it seems unlikely that any sort of experiment gone wrong, no matter how catastrophically so, would have turned a small, non-living capsule into a living, Grass-type Pokemon. We see an issue here. Let me offer my reasoning.

It's clear that the people of the Pokemon world know very little about where they live. New regions are constantly being discovered, but new breeds of Pokemon are being found to exist in regions where they were previously unknown. It almost seems as if people in this world are rediscovering a great deal of information that has been lost to them about the natural world and their surroundings. My theory is this: The Amoongus and Voltorb family predate Pokeballs, even Aprikorns, by a great number of years. The people of the Pokemon world saw this same pattern, a sphere that was half red and half white, and adopted the motif throughout their culture. Unown fit into this theory - they might not be the same color scheme, but their perfectly round eyes with the black dot must have hearkened to these ancient peoples. As the people's technological prowess grew, much like our worlds Dark Ages, but looking at fractals as they exist in snowflakes and the golden ratio in the shell of a nautilus

Vanillite is made when miltanks near death are milked for the last time. A pinch of their soul is attached to the milk, when used to make ice cream, the soul overtakes the frozen form to create a Vanillite. When this was discovered, ice cream was being made less and less, but the Vanillite escaped to frozen areas to be free. They bred to make an entire population, and when they saw new forms of ice cream like double scoops and banana splits, they evolved. 

TL;DR: Vanillite is a miltanks soul possessing ice cream made from its milk. Vannilish and Vaniluxe originated from it seein new ice creams.

As Oddish was one of the first Pokemon to originate due to the contamination of the plants in Kanto, as they would have provided more energy than the non-moving plants. Then,  as the chemicals began to permeate the water supply and possibly even the air, they slowly caused a mutation in the digestion fluids of the frog-creature. The mixture of chemicals that came from the mutated Oddish and the mutated digestion fluids caused the Oddish to essentially seed the stomach of the toad, leeching onto spine and rib-cages for support, of the toad and grow out of its back, fighting with all it's might to find sunlight, the two began to share the products of their respective feeding styles: photosynthesis and common-digestion.

As the new species of frog, which it now kills easily with the help of the Oddish's vines and its own physical features, the energy build up causes the Oddish plant in it's body to bud into a mutated version of Gloom (the mutation coming from the mutated digestion fluids). The budding in turn causes the frog's body to rapidly adapt to the new shape, creating Ivysaur.  Similarly, when the plant reaches it's full blossom, what would be Vileplume in the original Oddish growth cycle, it again changes the shape of the frog, to adapt to the larger weight

As time went on, some were born with germinated Oddish plants already in their stomachs, creating the Pokemon breed Bulbasaur.

My idea is that the Battle Frontier's facilities use a complex computer system, only the key change is that your opponent's Pokemon are given a handicap.) You and your opponent can then command your Pokemon (whether through a microphone or actually entering the virtual stadium is open to speculation).


Evidence to support:

-Everyone there has Pokemon as powerful as the Champion. This doesn't mesh. The computer simulation would be able to control the levels of the Pokemon, moveset, and Trainer orders.

-Your Pokemon are still at full health after the battle*; an IRL battle would cause injuries

-As we know

-No items can be used. Probably a feature intended to make battles more even. Plus

-The Battle Factory has Pokemon for rental that are rare, Latias). It seems unlikely that the park would send people all over the world to catch these legendaries, only to rent them out like party ponies. I think a better explanation would be that this would be part of the attraction, to be able to use legendary Pokemon.

Thoughts? I can also post my theory on Pokemon League politics later.

Anyways back to the point I was trying to make in the first place. Some Pokedex entries are stories or myths that are traditional to the poke-world. (Sort of a parallel to the Aesop's fables in our own world) This would would explain entries with contradictions or plot loopholes

Pokedex entries for Cubone often state that it wears the skull of its dead mother

Another point to consider is that the anime never mentions Cubone's skull coming from its mother. Also when I hatch Yamask egg's do people die? I don't think so. If so I would be a poke-genocidist.

This could potentially explain the fact that pokemon implied to be unique are not actually unique but in fact are only unique in their paticular legend. This however is a whole nother can of weedles and this post is long winded as it is.

The trading machine temporarily wipes this field in order for another trainer to imprint themselves onto the Pokeball.

It's quite possible

He was doing experiments on Pokemon trying to change them, ashamed and afraid of what Giovanni would do to him when he finally got his hands on him for destroying a multimillion dollar lab. He flees to Pallet town and hides the Pikachu, knowing that he will meet a trainer in the future that uses a Pikachu as his starter Pokemon. And keeps the accident a secret from Delia, saying that he wasn't cleared for top secret research that her husband (Ash's father) was cleared for, that required them to have no outside contact.

Prof. Oaks research wasn't totally destroyed in the explosion at the lab, infusing one of Giovanni's lower ranking grunts with a Pokemon (So as not to risk a high ranking officer to death) and sending him with two other grunts to see how well the process stays together. He learns the success of the project with Meowth, but he sees that Jessie, James, and Meowth are too incompetent to do any of his actual dirty work. So he sets the scientists on a path to create a stronger Pokemon, one that has nearly unlimited powers, for his highest ranked trainer to fuse with. They create Mewtwo, being more brutal

Oak hears about the Meowth about the time Ash runs into his lab, and sends him on a journey with it. Ash and the Pikachu run into Team Rocket many times, and Pikachu (Ash's father, being a high-ranking scientist for Team Rocket previously) see's the low ranking grunts, and is immediately disgruntled, and angry. He attacks them with more vigor than anyone else because he is used to being cruel to the lower level grunts.

Pikachu speaks to Mewtwo, and to leave them in peace.

I know not all of this fits together perfectly, this is my first thought out and written theory, so if you do downvote this, please give me some feedback, it would be much appreciated.

TL;DR 

* Oak worked for Team Rocket

* Ash's Father had his soul fused with a Pikachu during the accident in Team Rocket's lab (Ash's Pikachu)

* Giovanni has scientists continue Oak's failed research

* Team Rocket creates a Meowth fused with a lower level grunt

My theory is that Blue ran off to get weapons/guns. Something hidden from the Kanto region during the Pokemon War. These would be the only things that could cause Red to lose, seeing this in time, tries to run. However, Blue chases him, and only at Mt. Silver do the two finally reach an end. They have one last battle, and Blue loses yet again. In his anger, Blue shoots Red, and ghost

My thoughts on why Blue is the Gym Leader is because if you can beat him, still waiting for that Trainer who can beat him, the greatest Trainer. This also makes sense of why Red doesn't speak: Not because ghosts can't speak, but because he understands that you, the Trainer facing him, could equal him as the greatest in the world, by beating his old rival.

Some possible reasons:

* I'm wrong about the strategy, this is news to me.)
* Pokémon battling requires a certain kind of elemental ""mana"" that can be used only by Pokémon of the same type, I'm not aware of any canonical evidence to suggest that anything like this is happening.) Why should Ash/Gary/Red/etc. be able to maintain diverse mana while the professionals can't?
* Pokémon of a certain type have a particular ""personality"" associated with them, why should personalities divide so strictly along type lines? (How are Scyther and Metapod at all alike?) What does this say about Ash/Gary/Red/etc.'s personality, then?

Now, they'll be better at training Pokémon of the same type (see for example the two gyms in Saffron City). I don't know why this would be true for other types, though.

So I think **pokeballs**, they compare the size of their pokemon and decide on a scale, say 1:15 if they are really big pokemon, 1:2 if they are using small pokemon like rattatas. 

You could have little miniature pokemon battles without destroying cities using hyperbeam. And the fights would stay fair.

The Orre region is featured in both Pokemon Colosseum and its sequel, most of the shadow Pokemon are from Johto, even the legendary beasts, and a few from Hoenn IIRC. Then in the second game, Cipher steals a whole ship Hoenn Pokemon. This would raise tensions between the regions. Since Johto is connected with Kanto, it also becomes Kanto's problem. Since the Orre region is to the left of Johto and Kanto, they can attack by land, and sea. From looking at a [Pokearth](http://i32.tinypic.com/2hea6n5.png) map, the gravity is weaker and allows them to launch rockets with ease

Now the problem with this theory combined with mine is that the war is still going on, if the war already happened, and Orre stole Johto, Kanto, and Hoenn Pokemon in retaliation for destroying their region, which makes more sense. Another question that pops in mind is the S.S. Anne. In the theory that the war is still going on, it can be said that it is possibly a battleship in disguise, which takes place the same time 1st gen does

1340670244.0,vlodu,Good Guy Giovanni,Xmanzz,39,6,28,"This is my first time posting and if this has been posted already I apologize for reposting. 

But this theory deals with the possibility that Giovanni might of actually had good intentions in R/B/G/Y/FR/LG, they decided to create the ultimate psychic Pokemon Mewtwo, seeing how psychic triumphs over poison. However, the work involved would not be cheap and the government would be most likely investing all their money into the war effort. So private funding would be the only possible way for the project to be completed. Giovanni ends up funding the research and the creation of Mewtwo, and even trains it to control its powerful psychic abilities. But as we all know Mewtwo escaped from the lab.

Giovanni knew firsthand the devastating power that Mewtwo possessed. He felt guilty, and more importantly, ghost Pokemon. Giovanni steals this item to attempt to find a strong ghost Pokemon, because ghost type triumphs over psychic type. He attempts to steal the master ball because it can catch any Pokemon without fail. He hopes to stop Mewtwo by catching it, and the master ball was the best chance he had at doing so. Finally, he is a gym leader in hopes to attract strong trainers, as most gyms do. He plans for these exceptionally strong trainers to assist him in defeating Mewtwo. But like all his other plans, he took the silph scope from Giovanni, how truly powerless he is

But what about all the bad things that Team Rocket has done? It is true that Team Rocket has a reputation of being evil, they steal Pokemon for extra pokemonpower to help stop Mewtwo. Like most bosses of organizations, Giovanni did not reveal his true intentions to his subordinates. This caused them to get the misconception that they were actually trying to take over the world by obtaining all this power. Thinking like this also causes them to act on their own accord, such as their plan to take the Johto region 3 years later, and how that one grunt in G/S/C/HG/SS who stole the generator IIRC from the power plant in Kanto that didn't know that Team Rocket had disbanded again. 

TL;DR Giovanni was actually trying to stop Mewtwo instead of trying to take over the world.

1. Different trainer classes utilized certain EV-giving pokemon
2. The Tower and Treehollow held specific trainer classes; Tower held the classes which gave S. Attack, while Treehollow had the HP, Attack, and Defense trainer classes.

If there is a split in trainer classes between the two areas

*****

**White Treehollow:** *Baker, Battle Girl, Black Belt, Police, Roughneck, Hiker, Janitor, Miner*

These are the characters which utilized Attack, these stats are used to describe physical attributes. Attack and Defense, for example, can describe how well a pokemon and respective trainer can push through or withstand an obstacle, respectively. HP, likewise, describes fatty pokemon and all-around longevity.

Going down into uncharted areas, deal with blue collar occupations: Janitors, Miners, Bakers, and Workers. Most interesting of all is the odd inclusion of the Police and Roughneck trainer classes which have a dynamic of police and prisoner.

*****

**Black Tower:** *Psychic M, Scientist F, Doctor, School Kid M, School Kid F, Waiter, Waitress, Backpacker F, Lass

These trainer classes, and Speed EVs. These characteristics are generally used to describe the mind and its capabilities. Special Attack, for example, describes mental prowess or knowledge and Special Defense can determine mental stability. Speed, while can be taken as an entirely physical skill, can also used to reference the speed at which individuals can come to conclusions or process information, or an individual's IQ.

The classes found in the Tower seem to describe a totally opposite population. Many of the trainers are generally younger (Youngsters, and School Kids), richer (Gentlemen and Socialites), and even both (Ladies and Rich Boys). Psychics, Scientists, and Doctors generally describe more mental-labor-intensive work. Actually, probably the only physical labor occupation within the tower would be done by the Waiters and Waitresses.

*****

What does this all mean then? I propose that **the Tower and Treehollow are two approaches to apocalypse safe zones.** 

I'll approach the topic by utilizing the re-occurring theme of truth and ideals in the BW series. [It's known that Reshiram, Black game line, represents ideals](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Heroes_of_Truth_and_Ideals).

The Treehollow, whether actually working (Attack and Defense) or withstanding the environment (HP). People are expected to work for their food (Bakers). In all reality, there would be some sort of punishment system (Police and Roughnecks).

On the flipside, Ladies, and Rich Boys) and educated (School Kids). With respects to education (Special Attack and Speed), the population can be seen as more educated (Doctors and Scientists). There seems to be time for leisure (Special Defense), such as Backpacking and religion (Psychics).

*****

It's also worth to note that the White Treehollow and the Black Tower share certain classes as well.

**Nurses** and **Breeders** seem to further the apocalypse safe zone concept by reinforcing the idea that the people residing in the Treehollow and Tower have general access to licensed health providers (albeit not as good as the Doctors in the Tower for Treehollow people) and pokemon procreation.


**Area Bosses** are also Breeders, and Veterans. These trainer classes seem to have stronger pokemon than their respective area's trainers. They may have leadership roles within their respective communities. [If a person beats a boss, they seem to take over the defeated boss' position, as seen in Benga's role in both areas.](/spoiler) This could describe a hierarchy system within the community which favours battling capabilities in leaders.

Personally, because if it's genetic, the mutation corresponding to early evolution could be spread throughout the gene pool of the Pokemon in the area. Likewise, a virus could also be particular to a certain locale. 

However, as a fully evolved Pokemon would be much stronger than it's peers who evolve later. In case B, this does not explain why Pokemon of the same species who are owned by trainers do not catch this virus if the trainer spends enough time there.

Surtain types of gems form on its body in different places but others go strait to its stomach and get dissolved by its thick acidic stomach. In desperate times it can eat dirt and rocks.

Learn set: It learns but is not limited to these moves:

Leer: sableye gives a malicious grin towards the enemy dazing it.

Scratch: it uses it's large claws to scratch the opponent 

Night shade: it creates a ghostly void to scare its opponent

Astonish: it sneakes behind other Pokemon and frightens them

Fury swipe: the sableeye angrily uses it's claws to slash at its opponent

Fake out: the sableye astonishes the enemy Pokemon and makes them flinch

Shadow sneak: the sableye shrouds itself in ghostly energy and quickly appeared infront of its target and hits them.

Knock off: sableye hits the opponent knocking away there whatever the target holds.

Shadow claw: sableye surrounds its claws with ghostly energy (a form of aurora) and slashes at its opponent.

Power gem: the sableye hurls gems 

Confuse ray: sableye sends chemicals at the enemy which momentarily gives it amnesia and confuses it.

Foul play: sableye attacks (hits or cuts) the target with as much force as the target would to him.

Zen headbutt: sableye surrounds its head with psychic aurau and slams its head into the target.

Shadow ball: sableye creates a ball of dark energy and fires it at the target.

The Pokemon League system of turn-based attacks, controlled environment.

That is why Pokemon battles are vastly different from cock fights or animal abuse.  A Pokemon under a Trainer lives a happier, and still gets to fulfill its purpose.

**The War:**  To support the war theory, Gary is an orphan.  There are soldiers (Lt. Surge and his crew), and several adults reference a war.

**Normal Animals:** Naturally

**The Process**:  A man-made mutagen.  It warps human and animal DNA, Porygon, Electrode).  The animals that haven't been wiped out through natural selection were mutated.  That's why there's *so many Pokemon loose in the wild*.   It also explains why new Pokemon keep showing up as time goes on.  *They're still mutating;* ""evolving,"" so to speak.

**Conclusion:**  Japan has moved on.  The Pokemon League isn't just a sport or hobby; it's a necessary way of life.  A way of correcting and taming the mistakes of the past.  A way of taking man-made monsters and letting them integrate peacefully into society.

Pokemon like Jynx, and  Machop (and his subsequent evolutions) are an enigma. Clearly they are more human than their counterparts like Pikachu and Charmander. So, where did they come from? I theorize that they originated as a result of tests on human subjects.

I'll use Machop as an example. Lets say that you take a human subject, the result would be an increase in strength and physical prowess. Without an external stimuli, such as fire or electricity, and radiation exposure, the human subject would simply become a more powerful human being. Thus you get a Machop and his subsequent evolutions. 

Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Jynx would be the result of injecting a modified version of M01 into the brain stem of either a male or female subject. The brain would then mutate rapidly, resulting in a completely new body for the subject.

Obviously, Mr. Mime, and the other humanoid-type Pokemon would be very different. I imagine them being similar to a horror movie creature or something like that.

_____________________________________________________________


Things have changed from bad to worse. 

My team has been isolated from the events outside our labs. Unfortunately, China, the European Union, and the United States became worse than ever. On the right, China and Russia were backing Iran, Syria, and Lebanon. On the left, Iraq

What had started as a series of uprising called the Arab Spring turned into half a dozen proxy wars between the East and West. Nearly three decades later, was beginning. Two weeks ago, the USS Gerald Ford was attacked and sunk by a Chinese ballistic missile. In retaliation, US Forces in the South Pacific, South Korea, and Japan returned fire on Chinese naval assets and the Chinese mainland facilities where the missile was fired. 

The war started shortly after. Forces and assets on both sides launched strikes on each other. Quickly Russia and the EU entered the fight and over the last two weeks things have deteriorated into pure chaos. The report my team watched last night said that negotiations were over and diplomatic channels had been closed. The US Government had issued warnings to its citizens in regards to the risk of a Sino-Russian nuclear strike on the US mainland. The horrors of the fifties were back and much more real.

Needless to say, apparently during all these tensions between the crazy politicians in charge of the East and West, my team has been working for the Military. 

General Surge informed me in private that the powers that be had their own scientists working on the Mew question since the beginning. He said that they realized that this DNA could be used to produce advanced soldiers that in the event of war could survive even a nuclear scenario. At first I wondered if this man was crazy… super soldiers

1366161015.0,1ci2v8,A new theory on Mew and Ditto,JirachiWishmaker,39,6,10,"Yes
It is fairly widely accepted that Ditto and Mew are related somehow, having the same exact shiny coloration, and even having the same weight (8.8 lbs).
But let's get a bit more in depth.
Mew is based on an embryo, embryos start out as stem cells, cells that are incredibly versatile, being able to eventually turn into any kind of cell as needed. I theorize that Mew's body is made up of mostly stem cells, which allowed it to eventually evolve (Darwin-style) into the myriad of Pokemon we know today.
-HOWEVER-
Mew wasn't the first Pokemon. Ditto was. It is obvious that Ditto's body shape is much simpler than Mew's, as the only organs or real body structure it has developed are its eyes and mouth. As some of Ditto's stem cells matured into regular cells, it became Mew, gaining internal organs, a skeletal structure, etc.
Ditto is also know for being able to ""breed"" with most known Pokemon. While it is easy to say that Ditto turns into the opposite gender of the Pokemon it is breeding with, Rotom, and Starmie. Some of these Pokemon are not even ""alive"" by traditional means, and most likely do not even have DNA. (However, Ditto is shown to be able to transform into other objects, via Pokedex data, ""When it sleeps
This is because Ditto ""breeds"" by making a copy of a Pokemon by transforming into it, which contains some of the genetic information of the ""parent.""
However, but that's for another time) were created before Ditto/Mew, and Arceus, not wanting to create too many powerful Pokemon, did not put their DNA in Ditto/Mew's genes. This means that Mew really does not have the DNA of all Pokemon. While Ditto can create non-cells easily, completely replicating things as complex as cellular structures without the necessary DNA is impossible for Ditto.
The move Transform is not the same thing as Ditto's replication, the appearance is only an illusion, as the transformation isn't perfect (as shown by the fact that the HP stat never changes).",,False,,t5_2tpgv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1ci2v8/a_new_theory_on_mew_and_ditto/

*Here we go:*

The stones seem to work via radiated energy. The Pokemon does not have to break, which induces a forced evolution. 

This reminds me of a theory about trade evolutions in which the energy used in trading machines causes some Pokemon to evolve

With these considered

**Major Theory:** Let's assume Pokemon are ""mutated"" versions of real life animals, but had a cause. Some external force, perhaps alien, or legendary (or both?) caused regular animals and objects to ""evolve"" into the Pokemon we know now, maybe *by exposing them to some sort of radiated energy.*

Sound familiar?

Also

So, delivered (or bombarded) energy to the planet. This energy was chaotic, but when certain types hit certain animals and objects, they formed Pokemon. **A less concentrated emission of this primal energy could have been trapped within a prismatic stone or gem as an ""evolutionary stone"".**

Now, after all. This mutates the tadpoles into what we now call Poliwag. Nearby, a specific earthen gem, in a rare occurance, is also hit by the energy. The entire area did, but for everywhere else that energy just got bounced off and dispersed. Not this gem. It's composition created an anomaly where the energy remains. A water stone is made.

Those Poliwag are too weak for that water stone to do much to them

Now, that trapped energy is pulled towards the Pokemon and gives it a burst of it's pure energy.... boom, Poliwrath. This new energy even allows the Pokemon to develop a secondary wavelength.

Perhaps all Pokemon hold within them the ""white"" energy, I lean towards the first explanation.

So there we go. Thoughts?

The Pokeball is in fact a successful replica of the Lake Trios unique ability to use a Red Chain to capture and control a Pokemon... I think I can go a bit deeper...

Once the Pokeball became more popular over the normal bonds developed between trainer and Pokemon a company sprung up that began to develop better versions of these apricorn pokeballs.. Silph Co.

The Pokeball was not perfect however, till a more advanced form and better version was made.. The very same we use now. Much research was done, and diffrent types of balls were discovered and made with varying catch rates.. Silph Co. hit it big. It was time to create the ultimate ball.

Silph Co. created the ultimate Pokeball

During the creation of the Pokeball, ethers, and various other things that would benefit trainers.. Some were more mystical in nature (IE the Evoultion Stones, charcoal etc.) some more scientific (Magnet, Choice Scarf, Upgrade). Silph Co. soon monopolized the entire PokeMart franchise, making them even richer. This is why in Gen II you only see two store that are not Poke Marts.. These Mom and Pop shops... 

Now, Team Galactic, etc... These.. mob/mafia like Families using the money from Silph Co. to fund their projects, and such... This is how Team Rocket was so easily equipped, as well as the other criminal organizations...

Well

**EDIT:** Sadly, if you guys could help out, I think this might actually make a lot of sense

**EDIT:** All right, and they were left out of the deal..

(X&amp;Y)",Firebot21,36,6,25,"Okay so basically the main two theories are the X&amp;Y axis theory and the DNA theory. That's nice and all but those are pretty basic. There are some very good points to both of those but they seem to be pretty shallow. If you look closely though the X&amp;Y graphing and DNA can be related in a sense. First thing is the DNA strand in the logo. Now that's something interesting. Many people assume it'll be looking the actual DNA of animals

Now what's interesting is the architecture in this region. The Eiffel tower is silver and shiny

If you look though the tech in each game seems to be improving, and maybe the game could try to reflect that? 

We can't forget the basic X &amp; Y axis thing. Yveltal flies and Xereanas walks similar to the horizontal and vertical axis

Now the biggest aspect of this is that they look alien. If you notice they are based of the wyren and deer, but its more noticeable now. And why? Because the colors are very basic (besides the rainbow horns). They have gotten simpler and simpler which each generation, just like technology has in recent times. They seem to have a digital look and feel.

And thats the key thing in Gen VI, futuristic look to the legendaries, and more. Now where this goes? I don't know. As we know it's based in France which was selected as the most cultural country in Europe and they have general stereotype for not liking non-france stuff. Now this could be a bit of an extrapolation, but what if the Team (dobely doo) is something apposing technology. We saw the walking around with pokemon in HG and SS, so what if Team [X] wants to go back to traditional ways. There's a trend for terrorism for animals like the ALF movement and PETA, so it would be funny (and ironic) to see a Team PETA that tries to liberate animals, and fire bombs places to try to get back to tradition and to get away from tech. Now that might be a little bit to much

I just feel like with all the new game mechanics (3D and roller balding) and new look to the legendaries and new architecture in the game that they will be trying to go for a digital look in the game. It also can't be a coincidence (which it is) that Apple releases the iPhone 6, new google glasses, Android 5.0 (not 6, but still a big upgrade), a possible Windows 8.2 (reboot), new console systems, and a ton of new tech stuff.

-Neural connection building (so the Pokemon can learn the attack)
-More actin and myosin microfibrils for Fighting-type moves
-Proteins to synthesize certain molecules or pheremones (Used for Sleep/PSN Powder
-Functional proteins to transmit energy (light for Flash

Moves through breeding would simply be heritable.

Additionally
-Fighting would have more efficient versions of actin
-Fire would have proteins that could conduct heat energy, similar to many archea.
-Electric could have proteins to transfer electrical energy
-Psychic would have more blood to the brain
-Flying could have greater tolerance to high altitudes
-Steel would have metal fibers integrated into their bodies

The legendaries seem to be seen as one offs in the Pokemon world. Despite some repeated cries that they must be breeding

So here. We. Go!

* The Legendary Birds

Some of the easiest ones to tackle, are a bitch to breed in captivity. No way would the day care center have the resources (Articuno likely requires a cold mountain, for example). In fact, these legendaries aren't even stated to really be anything more than rare, powerful birds, further supporting that they are just picky about breeding

* Mewtwo

Why the hell would competent scientists create a killing machine able to breed? Nope, they messed directly with Mewtwo's mother's genes. In which case... Uh, way to go scientists. Nice job screwing that one up

* Mew

Mew give live birth according to the journals. I suspect that maybe, they may just be picky

* The Legendary Beasts

These ones are a little tricky. There are clearly multiples... Right? I mean

Quite frankly, and Super Flareon? If so, then maybe Ho-Oh took inspiration from other beasts and raised these three into that form. Or maybe they are just closely related to Eevee and as such, once in a while, a trainer finds an Entei popping out of their Eevee egg and goes WTF. This one is one of the few I have to file under oddity, unless the ones raised by Ho-Oh were either a dead set of Legendary Beasts (kind of weak ass of Suicune to drown in rain, though) or were just the very first (in which case what the hell did they breed with and why are they picky now...?)

* Ho-Oh and Lugia

From what I can tell

* Celebi

First one to have multiples of its species and not be a breeder. I suspect all Celebi are actually the same Celebi but in different points of time. Perhaps some events caused time line splits leading to multiple Celebi that aren't the same. Tl;dr - Celebi is a paradox waiting to happen

* The Regis

They are golems. Even Regigigas is said to have created a set. What's stopping humans from creating their own set of keys to seal Gigas away? So yeah

* The Lati

...Do I really need to say it? There is a male. And a female. Preeeeetty sure they can breed

* The Weather Trio

They aren't exactly giant. Perhaps they are very solitary animals that only get out once every few years for a breeding frenzy

* Jirachi

Once again

* Deoxys

It's a virus. I suspect the way it proliferates is very painful for the victims who are soon to become Deoxys. In fact, driven by the viral infection rewriting parts of their mind. Soon they change and then infect their family, who seek out others. So do your part and kill a Deoxys today

* Lake Trio

They were born from the same egg - at least the original ones were. These ones have some interesting powers

* The Dragon Trio

...HgSs has an event where Arceus destroys and then recreates the universe to give Ethan an egg. And he needs his power boosted by Unown to do so. Suffice to say

* Heatran

They can be a boy or a girl (Wait

* Cresselia and Darkrai

They merely balance each other out. Darkrai's ability is even described as a defense mechanism. Since Cresselia is female only, heck, the only time we actually see the two FIGHTING are in Mystery Dungeon, which is hardly the same canon

* Manaphy and Phione

We know where Phione come from

* Shaymin

Just a rare hedgehog that only breeds in flower fields that the Daycare lacks

* Gigas

There are statues of them all over that get activated. And they are clearly long lived. Perhaps they are like the Dragon Trio in that what you see is what you get?

* Victini

Only really stated to be a rare Pokemon. So once again

* The Muskedeers

Nothing more in legend than fighting in a war. So nothing in legend argues against them being picky breeders. Maybe their mates died in the war?

* The Kami Trio

All male only. So I'd assume they only breed with their own species

* The Tao Trio

Canonically there is only supposed to be once of each (hell

* Meloetta

Once again only really stated to be rare

* Keldeo

Part of the Muskedeers

* Genesect

An extinct species brought back to life and modified. I... I think Plasma neutered them

* Arceus

He's God. I think he can damn well do as he pleases

1356641109.0,15jaol,The League of Evil Professors,gravityplanx,35,4,11,"You'll have to forgive me, etc.  If you can poke holes in this theory

Let's start with the universe as a whole.  The pokemon universe *does* have regular animals, or bird will appear in the anime.  In addition, Pikachu is referred to as a ""mouse-type"", which implies that regular mice exist (or existed).  In addition to this, we know that pokemon can be genetically engineered (i.e. mewtwo).  From here it isn't much of a stretch to imagine that perhaps *all* pokemon were originally genetic experiments.  More supporting evidence can be seen in the fact that most pokemon do not have genders (Jurassic Park anyone?).  One last piece of evidence is the fact that the number of known pokemon dramatically increases every few years.  Perhaps this is a new batch of genetic experiments being released into the wild.

If we assume the above to be true, they also have access to pokemon never seen in the wild (bulbusaur, charmander, and squirtle, among others).  If they were responsible for creating pokemon, it would make sense to save some low-level but high-potential pokemon in their personal stash.

But this leads to another question:  ""WHY?"".  Why would the professors be mass producing genetic experimented animals and then releasing them into the wild?  For this answer

Team Rocket has a goal; Obtain the most powerful pokemon in order to use their power to control the world.  With this in mind, pokemon need to be trained to reach their full potential.

Enter the pokemon trainers

This next piece of evidence I'm missing specifics on, Red is seen in a later game on a mountain top, and refuses to come down.  This is because after winning a pokemon championship, the winner is given two options;  Join the professors in their reach towards world domination, or be killed.  Red does not join the professors and flees for his life.  The other trainer (name unknown, please help me out reddit) joins their ranks.

Giovani, but he was able to piece together many things on his own.  This leads him to establishing Team Rocket as a counter force to fight against the professors.  Team Rocket is actually the resistance, fighting the evil professor dictatorship.

Last few nitpicky details my friends and I have come up with to extend this theory:  Legendary pokemon are pokemon that, the professors abandon the plans and do not create new ones.

Genetic experiments also explain duplicate characters (Nurse Joy

1344479577.0,xx26f,My take on the creation of legendary pokemon,Im_licking_cats,31,2,16,"Sorry for the horrible story telling skills!

It all starts with a single egg in nothingness. The egg hatched and upon doing so

 The universe is still in a very hot state right now. Arceus created time and something to rule time, and he would soon regret it.

 Now, and ground. He couldn't let the elements be there without a master! He created Rayquaza, master of air, Kyogre, master of water, and Groudon, master of ground. He then made two Mews, one female. Now he must create a master race. A race that would befriend the male and one for the female. He would name them Adam and Eve. He blessed these souls and all of their children so that they would never change their form.

Giratina grew tired of of Arceus. She knew this was the perfect time to attack, Dialga and Palkia are there Defending him. He ordered Palkia to rip a hole in space and he forced Giratina into the rip.
He was very weak. He created two pokemon to commemorate this victory. Ho-oh and Lugia. He would sleep for now.

Now back on Earth, even though Darkrai wasn't the cute pokemon mew wanted, he was the friend Mew wanted. They started to drift apart eventually never to see each other again. This left Darkrai with a void in his heart.

Rayquaza saw that humans started to live together in large groups. He created Regigigas

Since Dialga had more important things to do

Rayquaza loved to fly and he wanted to share his love with other pokemon. Thus Latios and Latias were born. (This one was simple)

Society is starting to get pretty complex at this point in time. There are huge stone cities in what is now Unova. Two kings ruled Unova at this time. They were brothers

A huge war broke out. This is when Arceus awoke for the first time. He created the Musketeer Trio to protect the world from destruction. This war is what lead to ancient Unova's demise.

Mew, Cresselia. The hole was filled but Darkrai still wants to make friends. Everyone thinks he's a monster.

People started to build towns in Kanto and other places. Lugia Gifted the power of Ice, the power changed their form. These are Articuno, Zapdos, And Moltres. They can lay eggs to make more of them, however it's extremely rare. These pokemon serve as protectors to Kanto.

* Pokemom battles happen at will and never need to be consensual or escapeable, one of the largest companies in Kanto.

* The towns of Kanto do not have any apparent government, pokecenter and pokemart. Not only are pokemon the symbol of authority and rule following the war, their value has also driven the economy. All major businesses and research efforts are on pokemon alone, with the wealthiest and most well known figures being gym leaders, team rocket leaders, pokemon scientists, etc.

* Even with their bumbling manuevers, team rocket can afford to hire dozens of personal guards/members, thousands of feet of floor space in a variety of buildings in the richest cities in kanto, and most likely a fair amount of bribes to keep such a large organization from being caught outright. Since the slots are a fairly limited source of income for an entire organization, it seems safe to assume that a majority of team rocket's revenue is derived straight from pokemon in some way or another.

* The number one authority any sort in Kanto is the elite four. As the top trainers of the region, as well as pokecenters (as they do not charge for services), making the economic role of pokemon even more distinct.

* Kanto children are given a pokemon of their own at 10. This is deemed a coming-of-age event and is distinct in their life, citing how unsafe it is to do so. This speaks to how dangerous the world is, that few areas are safe for solitary human travel, limited almost entirely to main towns and cities.

When some one dies, say, the place they died or somewhere that was very important to them.

This is seen in

Evolution is just the spirit getting stronger by the resolve getting purer, who others could not yet fully fear, then charmeleon is the teenage trainer's soul/spirit, where they have enough resolve to finally start being feared a bit. The final evolution, charizard, is the feared dragon-ish pokemon who rules over land and sea, and the fully developed soul of the trainer

Edit: was thinking just after posting

Then there are pokemon like Hypno, and when he became a pokemon, he was cursed, but at the same time given special powers to use against the little 'uns.

Also, which was the starting point of people having strong enough resolve, when fighting a war. When the soldiers died, their spirits wanted revenge, and this created dark and ghost pokemon.

**The Creation of Space and Time**

In the beginning, the chaos took shape and became Arceus, and Arceus created Dialga, the Lord of Time, and Palkia, the King of Space, and along with them the universe. As Arceus traveled throughout this ever-expanding universe, thousands of years disappeared

However, the destruction that Dialga and Palkia had wrought to their own creation took shape, just as Arceus had in the chaos. Giratina, the Emperor of Chaos, arose from the destruction, and seized Dialga and Palkia in their confusion, and dragged them into their own destruction. Giratina showed them things that they had not noticed during their war; Arceus's will was joining space and time together to form creation. Realizing that their fight was folly, but Giratina's rage was too much at the destruction of creation. For ages then it seemed that Giratina would destroy Dialga and Palkia, Arceus

Arceus banished Dialga and Palkia into their respective dimensions, for the Distortion World, as this dimension would be called eons later, had taught Arceus valuable lessons. Finally he knew what he was to do.

However, because space and time could not exist without one another, this led to holes where the two of them could wage war once more. And Giratina was furious, and would forever aim to contain one of the two within his world to prevent further damage to his treasured kingdom.

**The Creation of Life**

Channeling his powers into the canvas as he wanted it, he created Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza, to maintain an equilibrium between Land, Sea and Air, where Rayquaza was the peacekeeper between the hostile Kyogre and Groudon. However, Arceus foresaw how his canvas could be altered and changed by the cataclysmic power of the trio, so that the Canvas could return to the state he desired it to be in: he created Regigigas, Regigigas only had the Design in his mind

Eventually the canvas was ready for the next step. Once more, each embodying a power that Arceus had.

The first type, and were very wise in all worldly things. This knowledge enabled them to transform into anything they wanted.

The second type, Celebi's were always there. Their attunement to this connection enabled them to pass through time.

The third type, while few and far between, were always searched for by Mews, who seeked their ability to create things that weren't readily available. Their powers of creation let them create things from thin air, while they often only teleported things over.

The fourth type, for Manaphy's could connect with any of Arceus' creations. Their ability to connect allowed them to swap hearts with any of Arceus' creations.

The fifth type, looking down on all the other creations having fun, playing and communicating with each other. Every one of Rayquaza's attempts to communicate with these other beings were foiled by the terrifying power Rayquaza had. Rayquaza went to Arceus with the humble request to make him a companion, a request which Arceus granted. However, there was one catch: they could only do this over day; at night they would revert to their original forme, a meek grassball. Even the transformation had a requirement; the pollen of the Gracedia Flower. However, Rayquaza was estatic

The last one, but retained a sportive edge, and never took a loss personally. Although they didn't realize, Arceus had granted the power of victory upon these small beings.

Arceus also created the Latios and the Latias

**The Disaster**

For many ages these species co-existed peacefully, Arceus started to believe that the canvas he had created was nearing completion. All that was required was that Latios and Latias returned with intelligent life.

Eventually Latios and Latias returned with a sentient lifeform; a bacterial lifeform that named itself Deoxys. Latios and Latias had encountered Deoxys by chance; while traveling they stumbled upon the meteor that was carrying the bacteria. When they were being transported to Arceus' canvas and passing through Rayquaza's atmosphere, started attacking the meteor, however Arceus commanded him to stand down. When the Deoxys landed they mutated to survive in these new conditions, and for a while Deoxys and the six species lived together, although Shaymin openly avoided them due to their connection to Rayquaza and the shared scepticism, feeling that Deoxys held a power that would destroy Arceus' canvas.

Their scepticism would prove correct, and this led to a war between the natives and the infected. The infected quickly gained an upper hand as more and more natives became infected until only a handful of natives remained. Rayquaza, who had fought the infected to protect the canvas, returned to Arceus and told him of the dire situation and Arceus, praying that the damage could be undone, harnessed his power and destroyed the Deoxys bacteria.

However the damage had been done. Of a population that had once been well into the hundreds of thousands, Jirachis, Manaphys and Victinis only numbered lower than the hundred each, and each species fled and hid. The Celebi's had fled into the forests where they discovered their ability to travel through time. The one Manaphy left became the 'prince' of the water, loved by all beings that would come to call Kyogre's domain home. The Victini's fled to far-off islands, and the Jirachi's entered deep underground slumbers, only ever awaking once every 1000 years. The Shaymin, were scattered

This only left the Mews. During the war, warped by the strong influence that Dialga and Palkia had in the region they had hidden in, warped to become the peacemakers should Dialga and Palkia ever engage in a fight on the canvas again. And so Azelf, Uxie and Mesprit were born. This left only a handful of Mew over the canvas.

Once again, angry that land had been destroyed, entered a fit of rage, raising volcanoes all over the canvas. Rayquaza calmed him down and forced Groudon back underground. However, as fate would have it, a Mew was passing through one of the sites where there were volcanic eruptions, and was caught in the middle of a large chute of lava. Thinking on its feet, and created the first Heatran

 Another thing that sticks out is wild pokemon. See, if pokemon wanted to keep from getting caught, I'm sure they would be smart enough to notice that the commands are coming from the trainer. So why not attack the trainer?

 Also, a kid goes around catching pokemon, ripping juvenile pokemon from their mothers, and it's all okay because (according to some posts here) a pokemon allows itself to be caught when it recognizes a trainer as ""worthy"" or something. What about the mother? Would SHE be okay with someone taking her still nursing offspring? If I remember correctly, almost any animal that sticks around with her offspring until they can go on and fend for themselves. So, apart from trying to catch a wild animal, you're defending yourself from a raging mother (that would most likely attack you).

Hoenn:

Hoenn has the most obvious setup for a war. One possibility is an ancient war between Lavaridge and Sootopolis, and with good reason: they might very well be proxies for two ancient, warring clans. One hailed from the Western, land-based part of Hoenn; the other hailed from the Eastern, sea-based part of Hoenn. I haven't played Emerald, so forgive me if I say stuff that contradicts it, but it seems to me that the games play out an actual war in Hoenn - the conflict between Magma and Aqua is an actual modern Pokemon war.

Johto: 

This region seems markedly peaceful in contemporary times; even the villains originally hail from Kanto. However, which were a single island at that time."" Could Ho-oh also have stopped such a war?

So

According to the [journals] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mansion_journals) you find in the Pokemon Mansion, as it was too powerful, which it is assumed led to the events that caused the Pokemon Mansion to partially burn down.

So

Let's look at the differences between them:

* Different size and weight
* Different Dex color
* Different bone structure, head, and chest
* Different Base and Pokeathlon stats
* Only 5 moves in common
* Different TM/HM capabilities and Tutor Move capabilities
* Different shiny coloration
* Most importantly

So why do these two Pokemon

When Mew was captured, Mew's pregnancy was not like a Pokemon's, it is more akin to a regular animal's birth.  Its usual defense of transforming to hide was not possible; transforming would hurt the baby.  So the pregnant Mew was brought to Cinnabar Island in Kanto.  Under the watchful eye of the scientists, it gave birth to a new Mew.  Now free to transform again, Mew escaped, since the scientists had no safeguards for this.

However, as if it had a life of its own.  This living blob, along with the data they had that revealed Mew as the genetic ancestor of every Pokemon, led them to arrive at this conclusion:  That all Pokemon are born from these blobs.

Now, but it would surely one day escape.  They decided to attempt something drastic:  Injecting it with the genetic material of an already transformed Ditto, specifically, that of an Alakazam.  However, while this greatly enhanced its psychic abilities, it did not hinder its transformations.  Then, they did the unthinkable.  They injected human DNA into the baby Mew.  

*ADDENDUM:  Some have pointed out that Mewtwo might have been a clone that Mew was impregnated with, basically to fill out the missing parts of genetic code, a la Jurassic Park.  The inability of Mewtwo to transform was not due to a purposeful action, but rather a mistake due to a misunderstanding of Mew's abilities.  The rest is the same.*

This non-Pokemon DNA caused rapid and dramatic change in the baby.  It quickly grew to be 2 meters tall, it eventually broke out of the Mansion.  However, it could not hide the way its mother had always done.  It was forced to retreat to a location where few would bother it.  It eventually found Cerulean Cave.

Team Flare are interested in this because they want to practice DNA manipulation. What they are trying to do is edit DNA to create a super-gene to inject into Pokemon to make them better. Other than the fossils, their other experiments include the new Mewtwo forme(s)

**Xerneas** After TF created an experimental version of the super gene, not Stantler), and tested their new gene on it. The Sawsbuck's DNA sequence accepted the super gene, but at a cost. The new gene mutated the Sawsbuck, turning its fur an unnatural blue color, making its ears grow longer, and causing the vegetation on it to rot off, among other things. Also, which is why its body is a sleek

**Yveltal** The other Pokemon that TF tested the super gene on was a Noivern. Similar to Xerneas, making its veins appear exposed (what the black markings on Yveltal are), turning its back into a rubbery-yet-strong material, making the claws on its wings grow larger, etc. However, the super-gene also corrupted the Noivern, making it even more destructive than before (why Yveltal is the ""Destruction"" Pokemon), causing its previous majestic Dragon type to become a petty Dark type instead.
Later, Xerneas returned to to the forest it was captured in, and Yveltal took back to the skies. Now, it is up to you to capture these mutated Pokemon before TF can recapture them and extract the super-gene (in the process of mutation, a stupid grunt accidentally administered ALL of the super-gene onto Xern/Yvel) to market, giving the richer trainers an unfair advantage in battles.

I was wondering how fossil pokemon fit into the theory that is all pokemon are mutations and a result of some sort of radiation from the past. If that is the case

 Though, because all 'fossil pokemon' are rock typed, does that imply that these machines are incapable of seperating the chunks and bits of earth from the organic material in the process of revival? If the world was indeed the Earth we know and had 'true animals and prehistoric creatures'... does it imply that the radiation used to mutate animals into pokemon is used in the process of reviving 'fossil pokemon'. Meaning that any 'fossil' revived will never be 'true' because they will be significantly mutated and granted abilities to blast jets of water from their mouth or whatnot.

 Another thing to point out is that most of these 'fossil pokemon' lose the memory of their past when revived. Though, or constrict. All 'moves' which 'true animals' have me known to be capable of doing. Only when these fossil pokemon start to gain experience in this 'new world' will the mutation side of these pokemon start to show. This was just one thought. 

Another thing that made me think was, one where pokemon have always existed since millions of years back, there could be a different representation of these 'fossil pokemon'. Having always existed as creatures capable of utilizing physics defying abilities, the earliest pokemon may have always been of the rock type. Relicanth can possibly be proof of ancient pokemon being naturally rock type and not as a result of mutation from nuclear radiation or revival radiation.

**The Creation of Pokémon**

Uniting the Mews for the last time, all unique and diverse in so many ways, all who had thousands of years of knowledge and experience built into the very core of their genetics. The life force was so intense that it gave life to the sun and the moon, giving birth to Ho-oh and Lugia, the Clefairy's, Cresselia's and Darkrai. The energy was so intense that it even allowed Eevee's to evolve into two entirely new beings, Espeon and Umbreon, which allowed some creatures to evolve.

However, there would be a time, somewhere down the line, that his creations would need protection. To this end, he created Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion, the Vanguard of Justice.

One more meteor crashed into the canvas, the dragon looked around, and saw two brothers. The Dragon detected that the two were to be destined for great things, and he joined them. However, the two were very different, and as they united the peoples of the region which would be called Unova, their conflicts became more and more apparent, who followed his head on the path to truth, and the two sides fought

The older brother, growing stronger and stronger as he fought the elements, and at one point encountered Moltres. The two got along immensely well, and when the brother told Moltres of his fight with his brother, Moltres was touched. To eternify the bond between the brother and Moltres, Moltres gave the brother his power. And so Reshiram was born.

Reshiram swore that he would never forget Moltres' generous gift, he would be able to defeat his younger brother with ease.

However, had happened to chance upon Zapdos and befriended him, gaining part of Zapdos' powers on the way. Once more they were of equal strength, but they reshaped the continent they fought on into what would become Unova. Once finally exhausted, they decided to go their separate ways until they found a creature with a conviction as strong as they did, who would be able to settle their battle for them.

Sure enough, Terrakion and Virizion remained busy. As they saw more and more terrible things, all three of them had agreed on one thing: humans were bad news. Many times they appealed to Arceus to eradicate humanity, but Arceus, wisened by eons, decided not to and to let humans and his creatures to fight it out; Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion were appalled and and continued to protect Arceus' creatures

At one point, Terrakion and Virizion encountered a young Keldeo, still a baby, in a forest fire in Iccirrus. They rescued the child, and raised it as one of them. When Arceus finally ordered the quartet of vigilantes to stand down, they all went their separate ways.

It was about this time that Lugia, Zapdos and Moltres, and they followed him as if he was their leader. The term Pokémon spread like a wildfire, traveling from city to city by manner of travelers who had partnered up with these Pokémon. Slowly but surely Pokémon became an essential part in the lives of the humans, having them as pets, working alongside them. The term Pokémon Trainer was rising up among many people as a person who traveled and fought alongside Pokémon, and an entire league was built to administer these battles. The first Pokéballs were created by manner of processing Apricorns, refusing to barter and spread the word.

It was about this time that three Kimono Girls entered Ho-oh's residence of Bell Tower, very tribal, did not take kindly to this, and in the ensuing battle burned his tower to the ground.

Each of the Kimono girls had partnered up with a Vaporeon, the Kimono girls have, since then, only ever used Eevee evolutions.

Ho-oh was moved by this selfless sacrifice, Ho-oh created Suicune, a Pokémon that now held the power to purify water, Entei, a Pokémon that held a power closest to Ho-oh's Sacred Fire, and Raikou. These Pokémon would travel around the world running faster than the winds that they embodied, but always, would they return to Ecruteak City and spend a day watching the graves of the girls whose lives they saved.

It was about this time that Samuel Oak traveled the world. It was always Oak's dream to document all Pokémon

However, were curious and at one point two professors, Blaine and Mr. Fuji, attempted to clone a Mew. They had found the DNA of a Mew by chance, but this was the opportunity of a lifetime for them. However, the extracted DNA did not succeed in entirely cloning a Mew, and Dr. Blaine had to step in to ensure the creature stayed alive by mixing Mew's DNA with his own, Mewtwo was still too powerful

Some humans had created evil organizations, which took form as Mewtwo. For a year Mewtwo served under Team Rocket, who had offered him what he wanted, but he did so begrudgingly, for the promise had been a lie. Fed up, Mewtwo exhibited frightening powers while breaking out of the device containing him. Mewtwo now knew that he was to wait for something strong enough to capture him, and strong enough to earn the title of Master.

Spies of another team, rather than restrain psychic power. They found a Genesect fossil and revived it and started to alter it. The technology to revive fossils was sold, and once more did Arceus' Pokémon prototypes walk the Earth.

Theory 1. If the anime and the games took place in the same universe, Ash would be having his with May.

Theory 2. So this is how I see the creation of pokemon. When Arceus ""hatched"" from his egg, he created Earth. Then the weather trio to make sure the weather didn't destroy the world. Then the unnamed dragon. It split and Kyurem was the part neither Zekrom or Reshiram got. He was neutral. Then, finally, he created Mew. He told mew to fill the world with pokemon. Arceus fell into a deep deep sleep to be awakened by Lucas/Dawn. Mew started to slowly create pokemon. As she got the hang of it, she created more. Created Lugia and Ho-oh to watch over people. Pokemon slowly evolved into the pokemon we know today. Mew created Darkrai because she got lonely. He had fun for a while, but they went their separate ways. When she saw a great war, she Created the 3 musketeer trio to save innocent pokemon. Azelf Uxie and Misprit were created to watch over Sinnoh. Mew created celebi

Theory 3. Gym leaders use pokemon closer to the level of your team. That wouldn't be fair to other people in other towns. Lets say a youngster in Olepucid wants to start pokemon training. He's been given a level 5 starter of his choice. He goes and challenges Iris. She completely destroys him. Now let's do it using my theory. He walks in there and she uses a level 5 Dieno. Not so impossible now. Lets say he travels to Straiton city. His pokemon are level 45 each. The Gym leader then uses pokemon close to level 45. 

Theory 4. People who beat the champion get a choice to be a gym leader, that is. How else would they get extremely powerful people? Let's say Alder steps down. They contact Hilbert/Hilda and Cheren. One of them will get to be champion.

Theory One:

Theory Two:

* **Unova was conquered by Kanto in** ***The Pokewar***

In Pokemon Politics, they would make alliances with each other. I'll give a few of my ideas as to what those might have been, starting with Hoenn.

First is Norman's Empire. Norman probably controls Oldale and Littleroot in addition to Petalburg

Their main rival would be Wattson. I think Wattson would ally with Slateport, for their own small tourist/health resort economy, and to have a barrier on his side of Rusturf Tunnel. 

All the other cities in Hoenn are isolated enough that they wouldn't have to have strong ties with other cities

Now for Kanto:

Viridian, and in return could get favors from Oak.

I think it's possible that Vermillion and Cerulean once had an alliance. This would be especially advantageous for Cerulean

I'm not sure what Saffron did in the past to piss off its neighbors, the city remains carefully guarded at all entrances. Saffron even had to establish a second Gym to help defend the city. Tensions have eased since then, and Saffron is now a booming commercial city, but this would explain a lot.

Celadon and Fuchsia were probably friendly enough at one point to build Cycling Road between them. Whether or not that's still true is open to debate; though the many Bikers on Cycling Road might imply that that area is in a lawless state

Lavender and Pewter probably just keep to themselves. Brock, so it doesn't have to deal with this stuff.

Now for Johto. (This is where my memory is weakest

New Bark Town and Cherrygrove are probably allied

Goldenrod, if it did, it could ally with either Ecruteak or Violet, though I'm not sure what besides tourism those cities could bring to the table. Ecruteak also would probably benefit from working with the seaside city of Olivine.

Cianwood doesn't have to deal with any of this

I'm not sure what the relationship between Mahogany and Blackthorn would be. I'm not sure it would be friendly though

Thanks for reading, I haven't been feeling too well the past 2 days.

Also, and it is highly unlikely that pokemon would have created steel themselves.  There is no reason they would, and this isn't something that just happens by accident.

**The First Step**

The creation of the Heatran brought upon an idea for Arceus. Gathering all remaining Mew, and the first common Pokémon. Kyogre's realm became filled with Lileep, Omanyte and Tirtouga. Groudon's land became covered with Kabuto, Anorith, Shieldon and Cranidos, and Rayquaza's kingdom was filled with Aerodactyl and Archen, while all were terrorized by Genesect, just as the Mew had

Meanwhile, but eons of flying through space had caused the two to become entirely independent from Arceus' will. They continued flying, Latios flying through dangerous asteroid fields, and Latias somewhat trying to restrain her brother's suicidal desires. She realized just as well that they had caused the destruction of their master's grand design, and both were fueled by guilt.

Eventually they found another sentient lifeform: humans. These were physical beings, small, feline creatures that humans called Eevee's. Arceus was beyond himself in happiness, but experience had taught him that he would have to test these new beings.

**Arceus' Three Tests**

To this end, forcing the planet into an Ice Age. Arceus was pleased to see that, while many of the prototype creatures died off while giving rise to such creatures as Mamoswine, the humans survived, adapting to the rapid drop in temperature. Even their pets evolved, creating the first Glaceon. Humans that had fled the cold created a town on the ocean, creating Pacifidlog. When Arceus commanded Articuno, to stop and the ice started melting, and Arceus was pleased.

It was at this time that Rayquaza detected another meteor that had chanced upon the canvas. He decided not to act. The meteor crashed in what would become known as the Giant Chasm, and as Articuno gained the upper hand, the dragon forced a usage of the great power that Dragon-type Pokémon have; however, something went horrendously wrong and the power warped into an armor of sub-zero ice. The dragon, horrified of itself, fled back to the Chasm it came from, and has hidden there ever since

The sudden change of temperature caused Regigigas to awaken. As it stood up, who were very superstitious at the time, started worshiping the titan, building statues of him from ice. This touched Regigigas, and as he went to return to sleep (the canvas' form was still the way he had left it) he blew life into one of the statues and sealed it away. This is how Regice was created.

Arceus was very pleased, the Lightning Bird of Thunderstorms. Zapdos covered the world in perpetual thunderstorms, and once again humans adapted to survive. The techniques they had taught themselves over the ages with ice, they now applied to rocks. Species like the Mamoswine became rarer and rarer as humans started learning to hunt them, the conditions no longer suitable for an increase in the Mamoswine population. However, the storms brought about a plentiful supply of water, and forests began to grow. In these forests, these forests enabled Eevee's to evolve into an all-new form

These large series of thunderstorms woke up Regigigas once more. Feeling the powers of the earth and seeing, Regigigas blew life into this statue and sealed it away as well, creating Regirock.

Zapdos couldn't uphold bringing the amount of storms he needed to on his own, gave one condition: that there be a third one that would function as peacekeeper, as he had learnt from experience with Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza. And so Tornadus

As had happened with Articuno, passed it's energies over to the stone, and this stone, when an Eevee touched it, would allow it to evolve, so creating Jolteon.

When Zapdos' energies had been spent, and humans came to worship Landorus, who had saved them countless times from cataclysmic storms.

Arceus then created the final test: Moltres, rivers, and expanding the deserts of the world. This drought was too much for many of the prototypes, and they went extinct. However, the heat allowed certain insect-species to grow, such as the Yanmega.

As with Articuno and Zapdos before him, into Flareons.

Once more, and he returned to sleep after breathing life into the final statue, Registeel.
Once again

I've got a shaky theory, curved feathers, and they are found in the wake of Cresselia. Cresselia, however, is neither green nor feathery. These feathers can't be coming directly from the Pokemon unless somehow producing green feathers which are attractive to Cresselia is one of Cresselia's pointless powers. 


I, why would Cresselia desire it's own plumage when it should have an endless supply? The feathers have to be from something else, probably another Pokemon that Cresselia is chasing for some reason. Since it follows in the path of this mystery Pokemon, Cresselia became associated with the feathers instead of that Pokemon, probably because that Pokemon doesn't stop moving.


If it were looking for just a certain species of Pokemon then we would have encountered it already, nothing green, feathery, and associated with dreams comes to mind. Besides, that would mean Cresselia would show up wherever Xatu are. I think that Cresselia goes after the wings because it's hunting a legendary that has yet to be revealed.

1371904373.0,1guprk,Extensive X/Y Plot Theory,ryanrows,27,5,10,"**Warning Wall of Text**

I believe there will be two teams in X/Y. The first will be an evil team representing science and the second team will be a neutral/good team representing mysticism/magic.

My reasons for this theory have much to do with France’s history and the land marks on the Kalos [map]( http://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2013/133/pokemon_x_y_Kalos_region_map_46486_640screen.jpg).

France’s political history is famous for revolutions and religious strife. I believe the main plot will revolve around the Science Team revolting against the traditional religious worship of magic in the Kalos region.  This is due in part to the introduction of the Fairy type and its relation to magic and moon-worshiping. It is also due to the Cold Steel theory that Steel will be super-effective against Fairy.

Before the events of the game, with the aim of adding types (like steel), removing types (like fairy), and increasing strength.  The Magic Team will be advocating an opposite view that the Kalos people need to maintain their faith in the Fairy type Pokémon that protected them from the Dragons that plagued the Kalos region in the past (this comes from France’s relation to Medieval chivalric tales in which magic-powered knights defeated dragons) and leave creation to nature alone.  

My main support for this comes from the map.  As you can see, the pink tower (what I assume to be a fairy lighthouse) in the northeast), and the big tree (southeast). Likewise there are structures that imply scientific growth – the geothermal energy plant (North), the lab (southwest), Lumiose City (center), and the mines (northeast).


Xavier/Yvonne will enter the game as the Science Team begins to search for the Legendary Pokémon of Life: Xerneas and Yveltal. The Science Team believes that by capturing the Life Legendaries they will have the power to manipulate Pokémon DNA. Throughout the gym challenging portion of the game, the leader will try to recruit Xavier/Yvonne to the Magic Team, but the player will not be allowed to accept.  After beating the 7th or 8th gym, the Fairy Gym Leader will return and Xavier/Yvonne will be informed that the Science team has successfully captured Xerneas (In Pokemon Y) or Yveltal (In Pokemon X).  The gym leader will then task Xaveir/Yvonne will helping him defeat the Science Team by capturing the other Legendary. Xavier/Yvonne will do so and defeat the Science Team.

Post-game, causing him to gain a second type.  By being exposed to Xerneas (which I believe to be Fairy/Grass), Mewtwo becomes Psychic/Fairy (the form that has been released). By being exposed to Yveltal (which I believe to be Dark/Flying), Mewtwo becomes Psychic/Dark (the form that has not been released). After the exposure, however, Mewtwo becomes uncontrollably strong and escapes from the Science Team to the Coastal Cave under the lab in the Southwest of the map.  In order to progress the game, a young apprentice of Professor Oak

**TL;DR** Two teams: Science and Magic. Science is bad and tries to manipulate DNA. You help Magic defeat them. Post-game you catch Mewtwo.

**Edit:**Well it looks like my theory was wrong. The evil team is Team Flare and their purpose is to make money.

But see

(Now keep in mind that while this is theoretical, this is for fun =p)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE PARTS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shell:
The exterior of the PokeBall is made from a very tough

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pokemon Meta-data:
This is the data of the Pokemon that is stored in the PC using a property of physics called

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trainer Meta-data:
This data is generated using a computer after the Pokemon Meta-data makes its way into said computer. It stores things such as vocal patterns, nicknames given to Pokemon and other addressing information about the trainer that has caught the Pokemon. Trainer Meta-data is updated when a new Pokemon is caught/released or when the PokeBalls are purchased.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Power Source:
A Pokeball is a mini fusion reactor. If you look inside there are 2 strong magnets (both green) that are connected to lines of batteries (graphite colored). These batteries store enough energy to operate the PokeBall for extended periods of time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Button:
The button positioned in the center of the Poke ball is essentially an expanding/contracting mechanic that specifies the state of the PokeBall. If you look inside the ball you'll see that it is conveniently stacked into layers or parts. These parts can easily be rearranged using some sort of mechanic present between the red/white layers and the graphite colored layer we see in the image.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sensor: 
(Mechanical)
The sensor is used to detect any sort of sudden impact with some sort of surface. It is made to not react to human skin. It also has a timer from last contact/new contact that basically lets it know if it was thrown or not. It also has an accelerometer that lets it know if its falling at 'g' or not. So if you juggle it for example or drop it off a building

(Audio) 
The sensor also has some Audio properties. These audio properties only work after the Pokemon has been captured inside the Pokeball. The Audio sensor takes up way more energy because it is listening to stuff all the time almost. It also has a built in AI that needs to recognize some speech patterns and using the Metadata of the Pokemon inside names and nicknames. This explains why trainers almost always checkout the Pokemon centers first whenever they enter new cities or towns. It is because they must recharge their Pokeballs and secure new versions of their online 'Trainer Meta-Data'.

(Temperature)
This sensor helps recognize where the Pokemon nearest to the Pokeball is. Its basically a heat sensor that lets the 'Scanner' (read scanner below) know which parts of the space around the ball to scan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Scanner:
This is the part that uses lasers to do the fancy stuff. Inside the Pokeball is a series of mirrors. Based on data receives from the Sensor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Transmitter:
This part of the Pokeball receives and sends information about both Trainer and Pokemon Meta-data from and to the PC. The computers in the PC do a huge part in sustaining the data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory:
This part entangles one atom of the Pokemon to an atom in the Pokeball (probably more than one to be safe).
This allows the Pokeball to recognize where the Pokemon that is supposed to be in it is located in the world to allow for easier returns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE WORKINGS:

When you throw a Pokeball that still doesn't have any Meta-data linked to it at a Pokemon, but its possible!) When this happens, the scanner is essentially mapping the real world into a digital space. It's creating a virtual copy of the Pokemon(must be real powerful computers at the PC) The nasty part is that as the atoms are entangled the Pokemon's initial atoms are actually also destroyed. The laser scans the atoms, the Pokeball sends the Meta-data back to a PC through its Transmitter, then the laser pulverizes the Pokemon's initial atoms. But right before pulverization, we have the Meta-data of one Pokemon. The Pokeball encodes this information and sends it to the closest PC. The PC now has the digital information about the Pokemon. Everything including its moves, level and even feelings at the time. Now this is the weak part of the whole theory. Lets say you now want to release a Pokemon from its Pokeball. The Sensor recognizes its been thrown, the Pokeball now only has data and needs to reconstruct the Pokemon from a blueprint. For the sake of fun, post it in the comments) So scanning a Pokemon is much easier than reconstructing it.

So while the Pokemon is in it's Pokeball its essentially just stored digitally somewhere. Time for it has pretty much stopped, or its due to the Sensor working properly and reporting that the Pokemon's nickname/name has been called with the Trainer's voice. (Since the PC has Meta-data that is constantly updated on the trainer and the Pokemon it can easily recognize these speech/vocal patterns). The same thing is happening when you issue a return call. The Pokemon simply gets re-scanned based on the Memory of the Pokeball. The Scanner starts scanning based on the atoms that are entangled in Memory. (since we know their locations at all times)

Moving on lol, but it should do). The Pokemon is then treated digitally. If the computers detect Poison for example or fatigue, they can easily rearrange atoms to fix this. After the Pokeball is done recharging, the Pokemon is stored into the computer and the Pokeball is given back to the trainer.

Ending points:

Obviously
But the main thing to take away is that a Pokemon is never actually stored in anyway in its Pokeball. A digital copy is always kept somewhere in a PC. The PC is doing most of the work. The Pokeball doesn't store much information it just carries out steps. ",,t5_2tpgv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/uhgkp/the_pokeball/

It is a gross misconception that they are intended to be the same character in different incarnations. In fact
Where Red took down all of Team Rocket

Red is a Pokemon Master. He defeated the Elite Four
Ash has not defeated one league yet.

The reason for Ash’s incompetence is that he has some learning difficulties/mental retardation. However

This is why Gary/Green has no interest in Ash whatsoever. He had his fight with Red
This is why Brock and Misty, and they recognized him, and traveled with him to look out for him and keep him relatively out of trouble when Red couldn’t.

Once Red became a Pokemon Master
After Red's defeat on Mt. Silver
That’s why Pikachu is so wildly overpowered

Essentially, if not all, the other characters that knew both brothers were playing their part to take care of Ash.

Firstly, Scizor. Genesect’s shiny form is a light red, very similar to Scizor’s coloring. Also, the stripes on the abdominal area of both pokemon are similar, as well as both pokemon’s legs. The legs on both are not only segmented, but also feature only one pronged toe on each foot. This may lead to Scizor and Genesect being much similar, but due to Scizor’s steel evolution compared to Genesect’s direct modification

Kabutops and Scyther also share one strong similarity, referred to as scythes. Genesect also features on aspect that strongly relates it to Kabutops: its head. Both have strikingly similar head structures, as well as skinny, segmented arms (a trait also shared by Scyther and Scizor). It is possible that kabutops’ pelvic area fused with its telson (its “tail”) to, over time, form the abdominal area featured in Genesect, Scyther

Now, Kabutops would have to fully lose its water typing (and therefore helpfully losing its double weakness to grass types) in favor of a type more suitable. The bug type would fall under the phylum arthropoda, as with shellfish (Kabutops are known as the shellfish pokemon), meaning the bug type would be the closest choice. Also, Genesect’s possible typing before being altered by Team Plasma would have been a bug and rock type (as most, if not all fossil pokemon discovered are part rock type). This rock/bug typing of genesect may be the missing link between Kabutops (water/**rock**) and Scyther (**bug**/flying).

Kanto out of the many regions seems to be consistently the farthest behind in technology

as such it is a rather rough living area for both humans and Pokemon. but Pokemon are of course more developed to living in wild areas making sure they are often tough enough to handle the elements especially for their young. so what happens when technology spikes and things become a lot safer and even in the most wild area there is some form of safety

we have seen evidence of odd evolutionary patterns throughout the world, weather they are an evolutionary stone or if they are merely something to help it attune. we have Magneton which was put through a extreme magnetic area and formed into a more developed streamlined version of itself. both showing that given the chance Pokemon will develop themselves and change their own ""rules"" of evolution to fit into whatever situation they come across

we have seen it with the baby Nidoqueen

So if evolution is driven by the natural environment

Here's my theory. 

Pokemon are different from animals in our world in about a hundred different ways, government, and societal values as real humans (except for the Pokemon part). Which means that they, like we, have an enormous impact on their environment.

What I mean is, becoming endangered, or having their evolution drastically affected because of human behavior. What if, in the Pokemon world, the humans have also affected their environment in such a way that *the environments those Pokemon need to force their evolution no longer exist?*

Let's take Eevee for example. If there were no evolutionary stones (which are man-made objects)

So what the hell are evolutionary items

They're an attempt by humans to rectify destroying the environments. If the environment necessary for an Eevee to become a Flareon no longer exists

What about things like the Metal Coat

These are different. Items that aren't mimicking natural environments have a different purpose, this is a more-extreme version of what scientists do when they transplant bio-luminescence from bacteria and fish into rats. Essentially, evolutionary items like the Metal Coat and Razor Claw are surgical modifications to pre-existing organisms to increase their strength by unnatural means. 

And what of happiness?

Happiness seems to be very similar to trust. Pokemon are not just animals; they have very human-like emotions and intelligences.

1. Besides through the use of moves such as Metronome Sketch, Me First, etc. Mew and Ditto are the only pokémon able to use Transform

2. Let's assume Ditto is a failed Mew clone

3.  The fact that Mew has the DNA of every Pokémon in existence

Now, it gets into a certain state, which, by the way, is very similar to a same state that can be seen when it is [getting out of the pokéball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZY3H613jo&amp;t=0m28s).

Both states are also similar to the state Ditto gets into [when it transforms into another Pokémon](http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xp24ua?start=317). So

1. Mew gave origin to other pokémon by transforming into them and breeding. Thus I guess the original pokémon wasnt ONE Mew
2. The other pokémon, being it the *transform state*, as it can be seen in the evolution process and the capture process
3. When a pokémon evolves, however, are defined by the species
4. Pokéballs are able to store pokémon when they are in the *transform state*, which is possible because he created them with this same power 
5. The powers of Transform explain why pokémon ""create"" clothes for themselves when they evolve
6. Pokémon that may evolve by merging with others, explaining why you can find underleveled evolved pokémon in the wild.

On the process of capture and evolution:

1. After gaining enough experience points
2. In order to be stored in a poké-ball, and that's why the pokémon's powers are hindered, as said by Cyrus.
3. Because of #2 is that why you can capture god-like creatures but you aren't able to use their godly powers at their best.

And homebrew it was, skipping the normal opening screen and starting directly from the New Game screen.  I chose New Game, I found myself in front of the the tall grass in Pallet Town.  I never named my character or chose a starter, but didn't say anything and the battle never started.  There was nothing you could do but turn it off at that point.

Now, each specific to it. With Moltres, it is situated in Victory Road. I had the theory about the Pokemon War with the birds staying in strategic military locations for Man. Looking on the Japanese map, Moltres would be in, or close to, the Southern Japanese Alps, a very high mountain range. This range could also block, one region from accessing another (hence why Johto was ""discovered"" later). This gives Man a natural barrier

Side note: Johto wasn't ""dicsovered"" till years after, around 1998, the year before G/S came out. This is why the train is in Gen 2, linking the regions, due to the mountain range.

Back on topic: Articuno is in the Seafoam Islands, not a huge deal, but enough for maybe a small operation. Zapdos, chilling in the Power plant, is off by the coast of Japan. Easy access to the water, for power. Zapdos remains there so Man can't regain the power it had during the war. That's why the train doesn't ""happen"" till Gen 2: Red captures Zapdos, giving Kanto back its power.

Gen 2: Funny, Jolteon, and Flareon, come to pray to Arceus in the Burned Tower to end the war between Pokemon and Man. Ho-oh, attacking something nearby, missed, and burned the tower and the Pokemon to the ground. Seeing the mistake, for a trainer worthy to awake them to roam the world. That's why they're running all over Johto: they haven't seen the world

Gen 3: The Regis/The ""Elementals"", it's a small island in the East China Sea....yeah, I have no clue what to make of that :P Kyogre is in a trench, near the Osumi-Shoto island chain. That chain is near one of the deepest parts of the world; makes sense to send the sleeping ocean god down there.

That's because they are to busy dealing with the war, and because they aren't doing anything too major it's not a priority at the moment. It explains the gym system and why children are able to leave home by themselves at such a young age. The men that are able to fight are absent from the game, like Red's dad, because they are still fighting in the war. But they are not enough, and some are getting hurt and have to be withdrawn like Lt. Surge possibly was. More manpower is necessary in order for them to stand a chance in the war. They also have to leave enough people to keep the Kanto economy and society alive, they are still children and are not combat ready

As for regions such as Johto and Sinnoh, they won't be short on manpower, or have to wait for children to complete their journeys. This is the purpose of the Hall of Fame. It records you and your Pokemon once you defeat the Elite Four. By recording your team, they are able to see how you train Pokemon, which types you would have a good knowledge of, and where you would be best fit in a war situation.

When it detects one or a group of it's members who pose a threat to the majority of of it's contituents, rivals, nice hats and being 10-15ish years of age. It's possible that the Voice can only see as far ahead as the current state of it's life forms will take it. When Cyrus caught wind of a way to reset the planet, the Voice began preparing Dawn/Lucas as a countermeasure against him, making use of others like Professor Rowan, Cynthia, and Barry to give her/him the guidance and motivation to fulfill her/his destiny.

How does this work? Well, Gyms, and that sort of thing. For younger participants, they can be accompanied by a parent; their parent can pay to stay in a house on-site (hence your mother living in Pallet Town/wherever, but also many of the people living everywhere else). Everybody else in these regions is either another participant in the League/one of their companions, an employee of the League (gym trainers, nurses, move tutors, or criminals (Team Rocket).

This explains why there are no roads or cars, and infrastructure, but there's no need for it here. Why else would there be a space shuttle, but not so much as a golf-cart anywhere else? (okay other than the truck at the S.S. Anne) It also explains why the Orre region has no wild Pokemon; most places that do not have an official Pokemon League do not have as much of a presence of Pokemon. These places are chosen and mapped out very carefully to include a series of different environments. Consider the cameraman/interviewer trainers in Ruby/Sapphire. They explain that they are there to watch up-and-coming trainers. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to be right outside of gyms or something? Well, not if the entire region is specifically for the purpose of battling.
Think about it. Do you really think every single person would care about battling/raising Pokemon the way the people in each region seem to

So why are the various Teams there? For different reasons in each generation. Team Rocket, whether it's petty theft or trying to steal incredible technology from Silph Co., no doubt to sell to the highest bidder. Team Aqua/Magma, for the publicity. It seems like they could pick anywhere in the world to carry out their ecoterrorism, but they picked the Pokemon League, a place that undoubtedly has at least one channel on TV dedicated to it. A disturbance there would certainly bring national attention to their cause. Team Galactic's motives are made pretty clear. Finally, Team Plasma targets the Pokemon League as the manifestation of everything it is against: making Pokemon fight for spectacle and sport.

How are the people in these Leagues supported, how do you stay fed and clothed? That goes back to the fee earlier. At least once in the show, Ash/Misty/Brock are depicted sleeping on couches in the Pokemon Center. Otherwise, they are shown camping, which leads me to believe that entering a Pokemon League Challenge requires some sort of aptitude test to make sure the people involved aren't going to mess this up royally. Think about the trainers you run into that are exceptionally young. The ones that seem too young to be embarking on this kind of challenge on their own are always close to the early towns; maybe their older sibling is elsewhere, and they're staying in one of those places with their parents. The other young trainers seem to be the Pokemon equivalents of the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts, people that have at least SOME kind of experience camping/living off of their wits.

I think the real target market for these leagues are the CoolTrainers, I think maybe they're like the professional athletes of Pokemon battling. While they're not on any sort of real team, they are competing for glory to fight the Elite Four, and there's no reason they can't have been sponsored. Companies that make camping equipment, Pokemon battling stuff (balls, potions, etc.)

So maybe you're in High School on summer break, your mom agreed to come with you while your dad stayed home to work. You sign up pretty late, and the only on-site housing left is not in the most accessible or exciting place in the world, but the house next door is occupied by somebody you know, so at least there's that. Plus, you'll finally get to see your old family friend Professor Oak again; he's been employed by the Pokemon League for a while to study Pokemon in his lab. He's got your phone number in case you need anything, and the same goes for your mom. What better way to spend your summer vacation?
