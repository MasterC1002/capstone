The End... 

It is with our regret to announce that NZBMATRIX had closed.

We have had to make this decision due to a very large takedown request from a company called Wiggin LLC. These represent the following: Federation Against Copyright Theft Limited (""FACT"")

As everyone is aware we are DMCA/Takedown notice compliant
Once this notice is completed we are left with an impossible task of policing our indexing bots.  Even then it won't stop there

Coupled with this is problems with payment providers
There are massive server/bandwidth costs to pay

NZBMATRIX has never been the subject of any legal issues or threats.

Also the Usenet Indexing scene is going through some changes

Firstly

Now, but you know what, why does it even matter? If some people have taken offence at the way I speak and act, then I'm sorry. Part of me wanted to make a joke about how people could go suck a bag of dicks if they didn't want to accept it, but then I thought that people might take it quite literally and go on a murderous rampage to acquire a bag of dicks.

Anyway, I was expecting a few hundred constant users within a couple of months... but it rapidly grew. It grew to the point where I had to get in people to deal with spam, abuse, comments and complaints (and they have done a great job, thank you editor team!) so I could focus on development. It grew to the point where I was putting in 60+ hours a week in order to get the platform to a stage where I was happy with it (it's still not there).

In the beginning, despite having far more traffic - I brought it down to $4,000. By month 3, I'd made the platform more efficient in general and if we kept it running on the existing cloud based architecture... costs would be around $3,100 a month with existing traffic figures. I'm pretty happy with that. I recently realized that spending $48,000 a year to keep this thing running (no way in hell were donations going to match that), whilst possible... was not something I really wanted to do. So I spoke with my team, it seemed great.

Some people think the drive was a good idea, we would have it. We needed to migrate sooner rather than later, and thankfully - we now have the hardware. It's some fairly sexy equipment that I got refurbished, sourced from a company that specializes in liquidating the assets of companies that go bust. To those of you that did donate, I really am thankful. To those of you that didn't because you couldn't, I'm thankful - it's the thought that counts. To those of you that didn't because you just didn't want to, well

So, I decided to go with my original decision; and turn off donations and make the damn thing free and accessible in it's entirety, to everybody who wished to use it. This is one of the few times where I have ignored my team and done what I thought was best. In the long run, I think that's the case - I've put enough funding in to the site now to keep it running for quite some time. I realize that my post on the nzbX front page may have seemed pretty snide - but it was a 4AM flu riddled developer who posted it without thinking about it too much. Apologies to anybody who felt a bit put off by it.

I am constantly working on the platform, shiny new prototype hardware"" phase, and the software is undergoing some serious testing with a small group of people; hopefully we'll be able to push those changes in to the preview branch in the very near future. I'm also in the midst of finalizing the logistics for a ridiculously cheap ""fresh content"" USP; with a retention of only 30 days - yet high speeds and super sexy downloads for all. I'd hoped to launch this venture in March and it seems that I'll still be able to!

My main goal for nzbX in the next couple of months is to build the damn community up. I have an update for the forum ready to push and I'm going to start incentivizing community activity... hopefully that will work. Given the fraction of a fraction of a percent of users who post comments

In other news

I won't ask my team to stop submitting here (as I have said previously, etc. This should make the small amount of people that have complained about nzbX content in this sub-reddit happy. I know can't please everybody, but I can at least try!

Again, we will not put a pay wall in the way... we'll just continue to make things awesome.

So

**How**

nzbX as an index will be closing down, ratings and community metadata with other installations. Neat, right? The index will cease to exist as of 6PM GMT tomorrow, at which point a countdown will appear on the site, when the countdown expires - super shiny sexy software release! As I can't really do anything at the moment, making code tweaks from a machine not designed for it is my plan (when I'm awake).

**Why**


Well

Today, as well as making references to the criminal prosecution of the administrator of a video streaming site. That's good, I'll keep that in mind if I ever set one up in Antigua. After this, whilst I felt relatively calm - I experienced crippling chest pains and my heart rate was surging fairly high in comparison to what it should be.

The couple I was intending to hand over control of nzbX to backed out, the location of the origin server is a big secret and there's no way anybody could have got your information.

So, I'd like to apologize to any members of this subreddit who have experienced performance (and quality issues) with nzbX within the past fortnight. We initially had an issue where our primary cluster (UK) had a complete and total drive failure (faulty batch), which led us to move over to our secondary cluster (Portugal). Our secondary cluster was never designed to handle the volume of traffic that we now have and as a result, slowed to a complete crawl.

The ability of the cluster to actually index became almost non-existent and site requests were abysmally slow. Thankfully

The secondary platform was turned off, we were in credit at the time. I was a bit confused and promptly called the provider, where I was cut off three times. Did I mention that I was in the middle of nowhere with one bar of signal (not even 3G), and not even a house for several miles? The timing wasn't great, to be honest.

I managed to get a stable connection to a manager eventually, I got an email stating that we were suspended due to copyright infringement and that the account would not be reactivated. This posed a bit of a problem, our backup was the only current... backup (we have older ones, but bah!). One hour later and a lot of angry lawyer raging over their terms and what constituted infringement - and we were back online (where we promptly made 6 copies of our data, which is now happening continuously).

Our primary cluster is now back online, access is routed through a number of reverse caching proxies that we have full control over - with all logging disabled. This has allowed us to greatly increase our system availability and stability, and we don't have to worry about a large (and invalid) notification scaring our host in to turning us off. The domain points to no less than three caching proxies at any one time, and a new proxy can be brought online in less than 60 seconds. At any one time, there are three online hot spares in alternate locations ready to go. In terms of long-term availability and stability - I can now safely say that we're probably the index with the most overkill setup. We have to fill in the gaps from the past fortnight in terms of missing releases, but this is being done at the moment.

nzbX has come a long way since it was started. We introduced a ratings system a number of months ago, people wanted to go ""good"" or ""bad"" - not rate release from 1 to 10 based on a changing and arbitrary method. Other indexes are now finally catching up with this. We were the first to come out with a global comments ecosystem, and are continuing to make a number of changes to it in order to make it viable (the consumption and publishing of newznab spotnab comments is coming soon).

We now have 120,133 releases - though not all are visible since we retain ""dodgy"" (spam, passworded, etc) releases server side for historical purposes. We have had over three and a half million searches done via the site, seven million NZB downloads - and over one hundred million API requests. Sometimes, I get the feeling that somebody out there has a very broken Headphones install.

We're making some changes to the way that our indexing software works as well. See, I don't think there will be an index out there that will be able to compete with us on this front.

Most importantly, no matter where they come from. Our premium feature set, is our public feature set. On top of the great features that we already have, we'll be releasing the following in the next few days.

&gt;A discovery system that is more reliable than the current (and highly buggy) broken piece of crap.

&gt;A cover view system for content discovery.

&gt;Additional filters on search and browse.

If you can think of anything else you'd like to see, stop giving private indexes so much money - profiting from copyright in the way that they are seems a bit ironic to me.

You might ask how I know this? Well,000 users and that their traffic levels aren't that high... despite that, they're claiming thousands upon thousands a month in server costs - which is nothing more than a sham.

Before we continue to give these people money, a lot and probably not much"".

Given I could now run an index the scale of nzbX for under $1, we don't even charge. Why? We made enough to cover part of our initial expenses and then we stopped worrying about payment. Profiting directly from copyright infringement makes people just as bad as the RIAA and MPAA in my opinion. You want to make money through indirect advertising? Sure. You want people to cough up a small fortune? Go fuck yourself.

Support the smaller private indexes that charge maybe $1 a month at most for unlimited access. With the advent of comment ecosystems (via newznab's spotnab plugin or nzbx's ecosystem), so why worry so much? It gets even worse when an index bends over its users, then you see people asking for an invite to it anyway.

* Added the ability for users to upvote and downvote files to help clean up the quality links from the dodgy ones. - not sure how to reward voters any suggestions? 
* To help with the voting I will be adding a recently downloaded list in your profile with easy up/down votes for the last X downloads. Might make it a widget somewhere (sidebar) also.
* Implemented SSL for login page. 
* I have further increased the backfill for movies and tv as they seem to be the most popular.

Now, so private indexes (or public) can hook it in, to easily display a ""global"" comment/rating sentiment for a release. Going one step further, I'm going to give trusted indexes the ability to push to the ""global"" chain, allowing them to add comments and rate a release via the API.

I am sad to announce that Nzbsrus.com will be closing forever.

3 days ago we were visited by F.A.C.T and served a cease and desist notice.

We were given 2 choices both of which left the site being closed but to varying degrees. 

1.)  Shutdown the site and avoid any legal actions. 

2.) Keep the site running and face legal actions. Against the owners and staff. 

In the past when F.A.C.T notices were given to us they only specifically named the owner of the site

It was a hard decision to make but the intrusion &amp; impact further legal action would have on the owners family's &amp; those staff that have only ever been voluntary would not be fair.

Over the last 12 years nzbsrus has grown to become a community

* They are not completing key functionality of the website before starting new functionality

***Key Feature:*** Discovery filters have never worked properly and being able to sort by most popular

***Meh Feature:*** Movies

* They are recreating software that have been in development for years, must be a better way around it than that.

I feel the lack of donation is down to the lack of direction of the project, then you can explorer new things. The frustrating thing is that they feel so close, but have for so long.

""Anyone elses NZBsRus VIP been removed? by dan897in usenet
[–]s0ck3t 3 points 18 days ago (9|6)
Currently the lifetime option the one that is showing on the site is not working properly


""we will revisit the lifetime issues at a later date"" was his only response regarding the issue.

Now I read the news post that the s0ck3t made

"" I am happy to say at this point we have currently activated 95% 

of the VIP memberships

The above is the part that intrigues me... if I understand this correctly s0ck3t is implying that of the 49k alleged members who got free VIP:

""...as many of you may know we had a serious

exploit found in the VIP upgrade code. This lead to 49

95% of those were verified as non exploiters and actual subscribers. He dismisses the other 5% as those that probably don't use the website much anyway. So where are the the 49k alleged exploit abusers? Seems to me like all this was just a ploy to harvest the majority of lifetime subscription accounts

""As with anything in life there may be special circumstances with each individual account

Help in the irc channel

I think that if s0ck3t had been straightforward from the beginning instead of implementing this after everything was said and done and everyone was hopeful shit would get back to normal

I've been using usenet as my main source of downloading for the past six years. I started up filesplit.org

I have been following the developments with newznab and the subsequent new herd of newznab nzb sites

Unfortunately a lot sites that reach a significant size experience the same issues of burdening server costs and threat of authority closures. A lot of nn sites have closed and many new pop-up every week

I want to run an NZB site that boasts the following:

Operates on minimal server costs. 
Requires no registration to download or browse NZBs.
No paywalls
Brings back the high quality of user editing. So will be completely user edited like nzbmatrix

If big torrent sites like piratebay and kat can do all of the above then why can't we.

I have an idea

In my opinion this allows me to achieve all of the above but most importantly builds an active usenet community

I'm aware this is no easy feat to achieve

XDM: eXtendable Download Manager. Plugin based media collection manager.

It is a python based program that provides a web interface
XDM is meant to be highly extendable and configurable.
It is NOT specialized in Movies or Games ... it has NO specialization.

It can be extended to work for Movies and Games and Music and what ever you desire.

In fact Movies
So are a few other plugins like a Boxcar Notifier
It can update if you run from a git install or the Mac binary.
Plugins are downloadable and updateable separately from repositories.

The site is still doing well, an insane amount of daily uniques, close to 5 million releases and finally, a little over 10,000 rated releases.

There are only a few rules I have in place should somebody decide they want to take over.

1. I will continue to host the infrastructure in order to ensure the damn thing stays up.

2. Adverts? Nope. Charging for access? Nope. You won't be paying a penny in operating costs

3. You will not have access to the users table

4. When I got rid of premium, yet quite a few ""private"" indexes are turning over far more than that in donations. Profiting from piracy kind of proves the RIAA right, so I just want a big free alternative to be out there.

Dear Sir

The BREIN foundation acts against piracy of entertainment content (music, computer games and other interactive software) on behalf of rights holders and interested parties such as authors, performing artists, publishers, producers and distributors. Together these rights holders represent the lionÂ’s share of the intellectual property rights on entertainment content worldwide.

We have found that one of your customers operates the illegal website http://www.usenet-crawler.com/ (IP 77.72.147.85). The website is offering a choice of popular titles in the area of films

The website is structurally making use of the availability on internet of unauthorized files with entertainment content without taking into account the interests of copyright and neighbouring rights holders. Such conduct is in conflict with the due care proper in social traffic and is unmistakably unlawful with respect to the rights holders whose interests are taken at heart or represented by BREIN. The website is causing extensive damage to these rights holders. The website is being maintained by one of your customers.

The owner of the site has not ceased the abovementioned illegal activities upon demand. My request to you is to arrange for the immediate closing down of this illegal website.

In the event you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Hello r/usenet-

I am bamathrasher, much larger and powerful index site, and so PFmonkey.com was born.

Now at first we had zero intentions of going public, to 150 members to be exact, and we prepared to do so. How we prepared is simple, I personally watched this sub-reddit for the biggest gripes and complaints about existing index sites and we really focused on how to remedy those. 

What's different about us? We are 2 admins who have taken time to learn the platform so that we can focus on site performance as our first priority. I've registered on other NN index sites in the past and my biggest complaint is slow load times, effort and money into keeping usenet chugging along. I'm also not promising our site is perfect either.

Our goal is to share our dedication to building a clean, nzb.su, nzbX, etc. We figure the smaller the community the better chance of lasting for years to come. I know you guys are frustrated with donating good money only for the site to go down a week later.

So... we invite you to come check us out

This is the subject header ideally used in YENC programs:

&gt;**[YENC-POWER-POST-A&amp;A-v11b](http://powerpost.free.fr/)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ajE0Qa0.jpg)  
**Pros**  
-Seems to be the most-used uploading program  
-Fairly reliable  
-Easy to use  
-Shows speed/progress/time remaining  
-Allows Par2/sfv/nzb creation  
-Allows you to set upload speed limit in real-time  
-Allows files to be removed from queue while posting  
-Open source  

**Cons**  
-Allows only four simultaneous upload threads meaning you likely won't be able to upload at full speed  
-Crashes if queuing too many files  
-Crashes if file sizes are large (4.37GB)  
-Can be buggy and problematic if your internet connection fails during upload  

&gt;**[YENC-POWER-POST-GB-12 Beta 12.2.7.0](http://www.alt-bin.com/misc/gbpp.html)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/89lRfnY.png)  
**Pros**  
-Same features as above but allows 12 simultaneous threads. Still not enough to max out high speeds  
-Still has a website up with working links  
-More options such as Auto Skip on Errors
-Allows files to be removed from queue while posting  
-Open source  

**Cons**  
-Contains same crashing issues original contains with large queues and files  
-Most of the expanded options are useless to most people  
-Tacky marijuana logo on the edited program icon  

&gt;**YENC-POWER-POST-GB&amp;L8 52 Thread w/ Progress! (GBlazer &amp; Latenite's Revenge)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/amLSi39.png)  
**Pros**  
-Allows 52 simultaneous upload threads allowing you to likely max out your upload speed  
-Allows files to be removed from queue while posting  
-More faithful to the original A&amp;A-v11b  

**Cons**  
-Doesn't show current bandwidth usage in post progress window  
-No official/trustworthy website to download from
-Contains same crashing issues original contains with large queues and files  

&gt;**[Easy Usenet Uploader 1.0.73](http://abook.ws/index.php?topic=2513.0)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/LMFRkwa.png)  

**Pros**  
-Modern/appealing interface  
-Allows up to 25 simultaneous upload threads (I max speed at 18 threads
-Speeds seem more consistent than YENC Power Post  
-Has a log window  

**Cons**  
-Does not allow files to be removed from queue while posting  
-Cannot change max upload speed once posting begins  
-Crashes and performs terribly during large queues or file sizes  
-Doesn't seem to allow standard subject headers (binsearch.info says on one of my posts: ""unidentified files (note to poster: put quotes around the filename in the subject)"")  
-High CPU usage while posting (35% on an E8400 Duo Core when posting  )

As you can see, 
so maybe the best option is in Linux? 

As of right now

When I used YENC Power Post GB12 to make a 537GB post, but 
it crashes if I queue every file so I have to post 40~ files at a time and keep queuing them little by little--there's no queue all and go.

So I am coming to you for help with questions and answers.

The questions are in no particular order.  I may or may not use all of the following questions/answers.  If you see that I have missed any questions

1. What is usenet?

2. What tools do I use to browse usenet? Windows Mac Linux

3. ~~What tools do I use to download from usenet?~~

* After purchasing access to a news provider and downloading the nzb of a particular release from an indexer
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cj5c0)

4. What is an indexer?

5. What are headers?

6. ~~What is an NZB file?~~
* NZB files are the most common tool used to download files from usenet. NZB files were invented to simplify the process of downloading multi-part files. Because usenet was designed to download smaller packets of data
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciewl)

7. ~~How is usenet different than torrents?~~

* With torrents, assuming a good provider, will almost certainly be the maximum your ISP allows.
Another point to mention is that with torrents
With usenet, and whether certain obfuscation can be read, is up to the automation process of the indexer.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciohe)

8. ~~Is usenet safe?~~

* Usenet can be fairly dangerous for those not paying attention. It is very common for viruses and malware to be packaged with releases. Using a reputable indexer, and scanning downloaded files with a good AV are good ways to stay safe on usenet.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciohe)

9. ~~What is a provider?~~

* In order to get access to files on usenet one must use a provider to download those files. Providers are servers that store the content on usenet, all providers should have the same content because of this, however in practice there are differences.
Sometimes files may not propagate correctly so a particular file may be broken on one provider but not another. Providers may also limit the amount of time they store a file after it is uploaded to their servers. Providers may also limit the bandwidth to their servers
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cj14y)

10. ~~Should I use a VPN account with usenet?~~

* Using a VPN account with usenet is beneficial. There are two major points at which your IP address could be logged and stored while downloading a file. First, when you are actually downloading from your provider. Although with https your ISP will not see what you are downloading, anyone with access to the logs of the indexer or provider could see what you have donwloaded or planned to download. With a (reputable) VPN, those points of identification would be rendered neutral as they would obtain the IP of your VPN server instead of yours.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cicx3)

11. What is a tracker?

12. ~~How do I get invites to private trackers?~~
* There are a few ways that you can join a private tracker. One method is by asking for an invite in /r/usenetinvites. Redditors periodically share invitations to these sites. Another way is by following blogs and forums that discuss usenet. Finally, or another forum) will help increase your chance of getting invited to a private tracker.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciewl)

13. How do I just browse usenet?

14. Why are things not completing?  What is a broken download?

15. Can you automate all of this stuff?

16. I have heard about this “Holy trinity”.  What is it?

17. Why should I pay for something that I can get for free?

18. ~~Should I connect through SSL?~~

* Some Usenet providers allow users to connect through SSL, will be unable to see the specific content that you are downloading. In general, it is recommended that users enable SSL as it has no noticeable impact on transmission speeds. Using SSL also can help prevent bandwidth shaping from network administrators. Finally, SSL gives users a greater degree of legal protection from accidental copyright infringement.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9civ13)

19. Why are there so many different usenet providers?

20. ~~What is the difference between a block account and an unlimited account.~~
* To use usenet a news provider usually sells access to the files stored on their servers. Depending on the particular plan your purchase an unlimited number of files can be downloaded from their servers, you can download a total of 100GB of files before you have to purchase another block.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cjdej)

21. ~~Why should I have a block account on top of my unlimited account?~~
* Because of errors in file propagation among usenet providers, content could fail on one provider, but be accessible on another.

24. What is PreDB?

* A pre database compiles the names

So while everyone freaks out about sites like NZBmatrix and either talk about setting up a new indexer or going back to the old fashioned way of searching/surfing headers - it won't help either way since USPs will just axe items they received notifications about.

The only change I can see that will take place that would change anything currently is the obfuscation of headers and the use of encryption.

I see the sites/ops models categorized into one of these 4 groups;

1) Cash in : Ops are in for the quick buck opportunity

2) Stealth : invite only

3) Community : Ops are genuinely invested in making a long term service that's popular

4) Here today

If you're an effective Community site, you're subject to being prosecuted for profiting by making copyrighted material easier to locate (Newzbin2), if you're not, then they'll make it untenable for you to continue (NzbMatrix).

I have been doing a lot of research on usenet and its setup with SABnzbd

My first thought was to build a small server to run the content aggregator software.  I was going to setup a small raid five server with a couple of xeon chips and around 12 Gigs of ram.  This system would be in the basement and would run all the time.  I would then have an HTPC or equivalent system on my TV in which to stream the content.

Would it be a better idea to just build one small server and have it run everything?  This would eliminate any streaming issues from the server to the tv.  If I place the server in the basement I may have to settle for wifi connection to my network and I fear that will slow things down for my purposes. 

I also thought of just running SABnzbd and everything on my desktop but it would have to be on all day to pull down content.

* I currently don't use any *paid* indexers for either SB or CP but Sickbeard is pulling / downloading stuff without an issue. Is this something that is required for CP to function?

* My quality setting in CP aren't far off from the default (just re-ordered them)

* The two times i go CP to find movies

* I currently push the little green arrow to force a search/refresh when i add a movie - is this neccessary?

As I said before

I had this idea today. Understand that right now, but I'd like opinions anyway.

The idea would be to make a meta nzb search engine (General principle of nzbmegasearch

The goal is to enable everyone to install said software on one's server

* No single takedown can affect the health of the entire swarm
* Everyone can use it

If the project proves feasible, and DMCA/missing blocks/password reporting. All of this would of course also be synchronized between nodes, within reasonable limits.

Last idea would be to add an API call for SB/CP/(insert automated download software name here) to automatically report failures, but the idea is pleasing to me anyway.

I would do the development part with a friend of mine and host a few starting nodes

Any thoughts ? My reasoning probably has some flaws in it

I have been using usenet for many years now and recently stumbled upon this sub. In reading through it, I use Newsleecher's supersearch function. For more obscure stuff, I use a combination of binsearch and usenet4all. My setup has been working for me since I started usenet probably 7 years ago, so I haven't kept up much with the 'scene'. 


I see everyone discussing the various nzb indexers and their merits, nzbx.co etc.) many invite-only. I guess my main question is, am I missing out on something great by using my methods of searching? Some massive quality of life improvement? I can see that supersearch and binsearch seem to be of a more crude variety of 'raw' search. Is the only difference the processing/grouping of the headers/releases and spam filtering?

Thanks in advance for any insight.

What's the point of making your indexer private if you don't bother to vet those people who are invited?

I thought private torrent trackers were set up more for the reason of monitoring users' peer / seed ratios rather than some form of security. The same concept just doesn't seem to apply to nzb indexing.

It seems all the indexers set up in the wake of the matrix go through an initial stage in which invites are dished out on forums or wherever before giving members the exclusive right to give out invites as they see fit. 

Obviously copyright owners have more resources to throw at getting invites to all these private indexers than any individual. So if it's possible for me to get an invite just through spending time on different forums

The only other reason I can think of is to prevent your indexer becoming ""too popular"" and thus more of a target for litigation. But something just seems wrong with that too.

($2 per month vs. $10+). 

I run a Plex-centric system in my own home but will be trying out XMBC for for sister and brother-in-law as it offers quite a few advantages. SportsDevil and format support being particularly enticing considering their viewing habits.

I am Ron Yokubaitis, Texas with my wife Carolyn including Data Foundry data centers which are covertly powered by hidden nuclear reactors. Server co-location space is then sold at our facilities at exorbitant prices to numerous power company fronts on the Texas Interconnection power grid. We supply power from our nuclear reactors to those companies, our other fronts, and various black sites via high voltage underground power lines free from oversight and regulation.
We hide many of our nuclear engineers under our internal Powerhouse Management front company
Usenet is a network of companies worldwide that share news posts called articles organized into folders called newsgroups. Usenet is different than Twitter
While news websites are limited to the common groups of say, and Entertainment, Giganews has much more. In fact, we have over 110,000 different groups! Whether you're a godless heathen that reads alt.atheism, an animal lover browsing pictures in alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.beastiality, or you want to rant about the perils of running a central intelligence front you started via demonic pacts in alt.demonic.possession
When I say news posts, alt.binaries.pictures.totty, alt.binaries.pictures.lsm, alt.binaries.pictures.ls-series, alt.binaries.pictures.ls-models, and alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.rape.
The last example is what is called ""cross posting"" when the same content is uploaded into multiple newsgroups. Posts to more than 4 groups is considered spamming and we have ZERO TOLERANCE for spam. Each spam uploaded through our service will cost you a $50 cleanup fee and we closely monitor traffic to enforce this. Spam is unacceptable to us because it is unacceptable to you
You can download or upload anything besides spam through us. We also hide your web based internet traffic with our Goldenfrog VyprVPN service. Using VyprVPN
Just don't tell us your crimes – your legal protection depends on us not knowing whats on or what goes through our servers
With a Giganews account and flexible morals, music, e-books, software, console games, pornography, or child pornography ever again. While not exactly licensed
While our price is over 3x the competition, lobbyists, federal special agents, and central intelligence in key positions in our web of fronts, we have very deep connections to fight for your online rights and anonymity. Our adviser sees a threat coming, so we're moving Giganews data to our Goldenfrog storage servers as our own invisible client.
Our invisibility comes from our third Co-CEO whom is our god, recruitment, content, customers, support, billing, servers, management, Texas at 7401 E Ben White
Baal has made Usenet what it is today. To show him you're grateful, and he just might possess you to offer it to him. The crimes our customers commit using Giganews make me proud, and their corruption fuels our demonic invisibility engine metaphysically. We use this dark demonic power to cloak our operations and fight against humanity with spycraft, frameups, blackmail, military blackops, murder, shipment
The Giganews logo is a red colored shield - subtle homage to the legendary Rothschild family whom has made a generational pact with Baal and whos family members I share much with and are our most trusted employees. My sons work here under various names
I selected the Data Foundry logo with the invisible “1” as it is our demon's number and power. While we may be called Illuminati
Besides spamming, Archangels, or the angels of Jehovah's 72 syllable name called the Shemhamforash. These are all unstoppable solutions to the 72 demon intelligences central to mankind, and will drive the dark of all evil away with an annoyingly bright holy light.
Baal is the distorted shadow and opposite of Vehuiah

I haven't used newsgroups since university..And it was only for text. Back then if you had any kind of technical problem and was able to ask it in a non-condescending way there was a group out there that would be able to answer your question.

I didn't realize people these days used the binary groups but then again ive only just found out about the .nzb file format.  That was not around back in my uni days.

I have been reading the back-posts on Newznab where people want to use it as a replacement for a website. 

As NNTP is as old as gods dog and the protocol is simple (the RFC's are well established) wouldn't it be more simple to write a little utility to scan the headers looking for a regex of what you wanted? 

You could have a dictionary of keywords to trip over. When it scans a group and finds one of the keywords it save/bookmark/convert to nzb those headers. 
That way you are not maintaining GB's of indexed data for no reason and its very lightweight.

Here was a site which had user content. Not only that it was popular with good moderation. It actually had much more social interaction than many of the bulletin boards I frequent. Hell

NZBMatrix died because it was too popular. It was it's own undoing. The problem is without its popularity, but if they didn't, the content just wouldn't have been there.

Many think that the answer is to recess back into the golden oldie days of usenet obscurity. And while that might make usenet eek out many more years as a viable sharing medium

My proposal is something along the following lines and I would like opinions on pros and cons of such an idea. Thank you for your candor and honest opinions.

- Bring back the good old days in one way
  - Site traffic for NZB downloads/uploads
  - Hosting may need to be OWN-HOSTED (Read further for why this might not be a problem) if non-anonymous methods for traffic.
  - Recommend opening VIP status for free* for first 3-6 months to build a large database.  (*VIP status maintained by requiring user to submit some level of content over a period of time. No user submitted content = suspension of VIP status until content is submitted)
  - VIP status should be given for donation of bitcoins (to help with costs of hosting the site)

Why this might work:

* Increased users to ToR increases effectiveness and speed of the network.

* NZB files are relatively small so they wouldn't be a large additional tax on the network.

* Having the additional requirement of knowing how to access the site would help towards taking usenet back to the dark ages

* Hosting yourself could be done with a modicum of preparation and study regarding securely becoming an onion hidden service yourself. With proper precautions

Some obstacles that I've noted:

- ToR usage would probably scare away a lot of casual users

- Some technical details about hosting

- Higher security requirements would need to be considered in the construction

- Site would not be accessible by the entire world (some countries block ToR). 
  - This might be offset by the use of onion.to redirect sites. Use of such sites shouldn't pose a problem for the site itself. The key here is to protect the site's anonymity, so user privacy beyond the normal privacy you would have on the site isn't really important. It's what you do with those things that is in question. If users have issues, they are likely smart enough to figure out how to get to ToR the right way or take other precautions.

I'm quite sure there's something I'm forgetting that makes this whole thing a no go from the start. Please give me your thoughts!

Again
**tl;dr: please review my ideas for hosting an NZBMatrix style site with user submitted NZB's in onionland.**

All files have ""NODLABS"" in the filename.  They are also only 7 hours old.

What is the best way to proceed?

* Can I flag them as Encrypted for review and de-indexing at NZB.su through their interface somehow?
* Can I tell Sickbeard to filter any NZB's with ""NODLABS"" in the title?
* Is there a feature in Sickbeard similar to Couchpotato in which I can choose another NZB after failure?  It seems to go back and choose the same NZB's again.

Could usenet providers get away with complying with DMCA takedowns but only for the region for which the agent is claiming rights for?

Of course they could still file takedowns with their agents in every region but at least it would create more red tape and give more time for international users to download content.
