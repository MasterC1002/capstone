Hello

I would first like to say that this has been an incredible experience and I hadn't the briefest hope that this would gain so much traction. I came to reddit this morning seeking advice from what I assumed to be the incredibly rare and nearly extinct Civ II player. Instead, just as I have, is such wonderful vindication in its own right. Thank you. 

 I'll confess that I had great difficulty releasing this at first. Until I saw the fan fics, the intensity of it all. And realized it would be wrong of me not to.

That said
First: I will not be switching to fundamentalism. The Celtic people (in my personal continuum) are wary of it
Second: On the Viking front, very few. 
Third: The Sioux barely cling to life with four cities on a remote island. I overlooked this in the original post because they are largely irrelevant . Though I don't expect them to last long. The Americans have been pursuing them ruthlessly. 

So good luck and God speed! ",,t5_2ua25,False,,Celtania,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uyswv/here_it_is/

Alright

Be smart about what you're buying (Offshore Platforms are MANDATORY on any major coast city for any production to occur. Spend your treasury on THE FIRST POSSIBLE TURN to fast build them. Seriously

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/57682/Missions/cu_a3993.sav

You can easily get quite a few cities back up to a reasonable amount of production.  At the end of my game I had these cities over 30 shields/turn:

* Balamb
* Dinas Tirith
* Dukedom'Dollet
* Chateau'Dif
* Monte'Cristo
* Issus
* Selbina

Next: I only built two Engineers the entire game

Taking on the Vikings:

Hopefully your alliance with the Americans holds

Instead

* Your transport must be able to reach across the gap in one turn to prevent it being sunk.
* You want to land in a DEVELOPED area.  Use the Viking's own railroads against them.  Because of how intertwined my units were in their own countryside they never were able to successfully nuke my army.

Howitzers really should be the main portion of your army.  Fighting the triple-defense that City Walls gives is unacceptable if they've got Mech Inf behind them.

The follow-up here is where it gets interesting.  Because all of your production facilities are on islands, you'll probably have the cash on hand by that point).

After the landing, they auto-disembark and save a movement point) opens up the soft underbelly of the Vikings.  At this point you can use their own railroad system against them and hit them in the cities towards the back where their bombers and nukes are located.  If Partisans break one of the railroads from Sydney to the rest of Vikingville, try to get an Engineer to at least stick a road there.   Howitzers fighting at 1/3rd can at least nail the ridiculously soft targets like Spies/Engineers/Missiles, but don't go throwing them away against anything harder at 1/3 strength.

As far as fighting America goes, had 4 nuclear weapons when I fought them) but have a minimal ground force.  I got the jump on them with a majority of my Howitzer army and knocked them from ~430 units on map to under 250 in a turn.  The counter attack for the first turn was very strong (~18 units lost not counting the city they managed to nuke) but dropped off rapidly as their bombers lost the airfields they needed to base out of.  Their navy is nothing in comparison to the Viking navy, so if you have any veterans from that you should sweep aside the weak American navy without issue (2 Battleships, 1 AEGIS, 3 Destroyers, 1 Submarine was all I saw from the American navy).  You already have a strong railroad connection so the key here is just hitting them fast and hard, you don't want to get bogged down.

It’s been one year to the day since I shared my 10 (now 11) year game of Civ II, I was overwhelmed with the response and number of helpful strategies and spent much of the last year experimenting with them. Of particular effectiveness was Stumpter’s 58 year solution which I was able to execute within a similar time frame. I’ve included the link to his strategy so that those interested may review its details themselves. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uzm4w/took_58_years_ingame_but_i_pulled_it_off/

That said; in January of this year I decided to continue playing on my original save file, I could if I want at any time, crush the Viking menace with relative ease. I continue the story now simply to see the narrative play itself out. Besides, keeping them around has its uses when considered from a certain perspective. Consider if you will, what need would there be for my glorious Celtic Communist state to exist in a world at peace? How would I justify to the masses the need for brutal dictatorship and big brother’s watchful eye if there is no longer an external threat to protect them from? I couldn't. And so the external threat must be maintained of course. The parallels of my Eternal War to George Orwell’s 1984 were of course apparent, but I have since decided to fully embrace our inevitable Orwellian future. Or present, considering the headlines. Whether it’s the NSA spying on our communications, or President Assad of Syria butchering entire cities worth of his own countrymen to remain in power
 
The year is 4200 AD. The world is a nightmare of suffering and devastation. This has not changed. Two more centuries of war have yielded no victor. But of course this is now by design rather than stalemate. Rather than destroy the Vikings, where a civilization would split into two separate civs if their capital was captured during a time of war. The naval campaign was a disaster. Viking cruise missiles wiped out most of the fleet along with most of the troops in transport before they ever made landfall. Eventually Piza did fall, but this did not result in a civil war as I had hoped. I soon withdrew from the city which was of course recaptured shortly thereafter. And so went 40 years of planning and preparation.

The 42nd century was dominated by an unprecedented number of uprisings and rebellions across my empire.  Every other year it seemed as though fresh waves would replace the rebels I gunned down the year before. Even with my overwhelming military advantage, more rebels would appear elsewhere and thus divide my attention.  This culminated in the sacking of the city Shoreside Vale. At that point for the first time ever, I had more troops engaged in quelling rebellions than fighting the Vikings. And not because they were particularly powerful; but because there were so many and so disparate, spread across all reaches of my empire. Eventually I created a squadron of fighters, not bound by roads, specifically to engage the rebels so that the rest of my production could be focused on maintaining the status quo on the front lines. This is where things stand now.  My alliance with the Americans remains strong, and the Sioux remain weak. All is as it should be. I shall update you all on the situation once again before the end of the year. And remember: Big brother is watching….

The Celt
The Viking, which is being invaded by American forces.
The American, which is being occupied by Celts.
The Siouan

The four stories take place on the same day

There needs to be some clarification on what exactly started the war. My idea is that a territorial dispute between Colonial American Greenland and Viking Greenland resulted in a cold war of sorts. When the Celts allied with the Americans early on and sent troops to protect the American colony, the Celts broke their alliance with the Americans, and decided to fight against them and the Vikings. At the five-year mark, nukes were soon put into use against all the different powers. As the decades passed on, the war eventually turned not into a war of territory, but to a war of revenge, retribution,,1339725641.0,t3_v0npf

The Celtic propaganda machine was a strong thing, the highest population on the planet, and the strongest military on the planet with the largest nuclear arsenal.  It seemed to me that they could end the war with one historic push, but after 1700 years of war, there was no end in sight.

I asked myself why.  They claimed that they wanted to be a free democracy that valued human life and honor, declared that such a thing would get in the way of their never ending war.  It seemed to me that they wanted the war to continue just for the sake of staying in power and keeping it all going.  Too much had been invested at this point to simply produce the effort necessary to win.

I had considered leading that nation to greatness until I knew the truth.  What I did instead was take a good hard look around the world.  I found a tiny island with barely 110, yet refused to give up their system of government or their way of life.  They were at peace with not one, but two of the worlds superpowers.  Who was the only nation they were at war with?  That's right, the warmongering Celts, the same people who wouldn't even acknowledge that the Sioux exist.

So I offered them my help

The first few years were rough.  Farmland was impossible to obtain due to nuclear winter and encroachment of swampland.  The focus was to build harbors and ramp up food production from the sea.  Since we would be using the sea

I also made it my priority to back my words with nuclear weapons.  The other nations of the world would be a lot more hesitant to attack someone with nuclear capabilities.  

For ten years I built up my infrastructure while the other three nations fought.  They lobbed nuclear weapons at each other seemingly without regard.  In 4001, and the new English Empire.

I didn't pay much attention to this.  I kept building up my infrastructure and decided that it was time to build a new city.

Airports were now to be constructed for quick transportation to the Viking mainland, but then the Vikings got wind and Edinborough was promptly nuked, all perished. So airlifting was decided as the way to go. Within a few short years, howitzers were happily arriving en masse at New Vikingland.

The assault began with the Viking capital, “maybe the city guards at different sides of the city could be bought for different amounts?” some said. (NB: This actually works in the game!). Of course, all bought troops would immediately be sent on suicide missions against their old compatriots, if they had turned once, wouldn’t they turn again just as easily?

The war progressed very well, Sun Tzu’s War Academy and most despairingly, The Cure for Cancer, never to be seen again. Fortunately, no one remembered who Michelangelo was, and although cancer was rife due to the massive levels of radiation everywhere, most people died of other causes long before succumbing to cancer. The Vikings soon began employing the tactic of using the United Nations to force peace treaties and cease fires, but luckily they soon ‘conscripted’ and headed off to the front lines to never be heard from again.

The Americans must have been getting wary at this point as they soon made an outrageous demand for cash which was readily rejected, war was declared opening a second front up. They started by unleashing their formidable air force of stealth bombers, but the defences held. The Americans and Vikings then formed an alliance and signed the ‘Verona pact’ to contain the so called ‘Celtic aggression’, when they knew the Celts were simply defending themselves. Soon, the Vikings had capitulated, so much so that the final Viking city was bought by a spy for a mere 35 gold, a fitting end to a once dominant force.

The American war was progressing well, devastating their own civilian population, further justified the Celtic mantra of no mercy. So the howitzers rained down destruction upon American cities indiscriminately and they were soon finished, in the year 4043, 52 years from when the council first met.

The war was finally over. Huge celebrations were held in the radioactive swamps all across the land. The war had continued so long, since most other zoo worthy animals had long since perished. During the war the polar icecaps had melted a further three times, but remarkably, since the remaining ice was actually below sea level, the sea level receded causing further celebration. But next was time for the clean up, swamps were drained, pollution removed from the land and dumped into the sea and people saw farmland for the first time in centuries. Mass building of new cities began to contain the large numbers of mutant barbarians that were uprising across the land and all was well.

1339870387.0,v59ok,Eternal War - 200 years on,inigos,261,37,16,"&gt; For your homework

The New Era began in 3991 AD, and we were Communists. 

It all changed when the Druid took over, which is what we've got now. The Druid explained that we would have a few decades of sacrifice and hardship, but after that, everything would be much better. He then launched an all-out assault on the Vikings.

Every family has stories of those days. My great-great-grandmother sneaked into Roskilde and managed to sabotage a nuclear missile just before it was launched at our troops. My friend Deirdre's great-great-grandfather spent years with his tank battalion outside Giza

Finally, and our spies were able to convince their remaining cities to join our side. Sydney was the last Viking city, and they come over to us peacefully as soon as it was explained to them how superior the Celtic way of life is. For the first time in millenia, we were at peace.

The Viking cities had many luxuries - granaries, police stations, cathedrals - that we sold off to help pay the pensions of our war veterans. I wonder what they were like? We don't have buildings like that nowadays: there's no point, since the Druid tells us that there's nothing new to learn.

There were only four years of peace

Fortunately, bombers and spies, which were conveniently sited near the American cities. When the treacherous Americans effectively stabbed us in the back, we were ready to retaliate.

We took Izumo, and we sent transports full of howitzers across from New Vikingland. We also sent our battleships to attack the Sioux, but due to a navigation error they went in the wrong direction for several years.

In 4020, the Americans nuked San Francisco, destroying their own people! This shows how untrustworthy the Americans are. We call our soldiers who died that day the San Francisco Martyrs - they were the last people to be killed by nuclear weapons. We could have retaliated with our own nukes, but that would have been wrong.

In 4022, they defeated the Sioux. Simultaneously, our forces landed at Atlanta to take out the remaining American cities. The Sioux and the Americans begged us for peace, and we granted it. The war was over.

The Druid stepped down from power in 4024 AD, everyone voted for the Druid's party, and they've remained in power ever since. It took almost forty years to clean up all of the radiation from the nukes, but we finally did it in 4061 AD, and since then our engineers have been converting the swamps to farmland, and planting trees. There used to be problems with something called Global Warming, but that's gone away since the pollution was cleared up.

The Americans and Sioux are still around, and the Americans are on a little swampy island in a tiny city called Crete. I went there on a school trip to look at them, once. I don't know why they want to live in such nasty places - Celtania is much nicer. 

There were less than 16 million people in Celtania at the beginning of the New Era, and it won a prize. 

The Celts are the best civilization ever!

tl;dr Vikings beaten after 21 years, 160 million people in Celtania and everyone happy.

He peered at the men through his gas mask. Reaching into his heavy duster

He loaded a clip into his rifle and took a deep breath, a quiet, pleading tone in his voice. Silence. He let out a sharp exhale, his mask turning it into a low howl. 

A comrade approached from his left. ""Níl aon phointe i ag caint leo. Just a dhéanamh air."" His teammate offered him a sharp stare

After losing several tanks in the first turn I realized that was a dead end. Jets and bombers were equally useless against quadruple Aeriel defense (SDI + SAM) in virtually all cities. So I decided to try a different angle: to buy my way in. 
Somehow, in about two turns. Didn't cont that much, neither. 
The Vikings proved to be more of a challenge. The great thing about buying cities is that you often gain control of sizable numbers of enemy troops. I quickly learned it was best to simply fortify these troops and wait until taxes raised enough money to buy more cities. From here on out it was like a game of monopoly, but I had soon created a momentum the Vikings were not going to come back from. 
Once the Vikings were all bought out
So I kept the peace: and instead again went on a shopping spree, and then and building and selling improvements for cash. By the end of the game I had sold off everything that was not essential for making more money, including missile and nuke defenses: no use in preparing for a war that isn't going to happen. The more cities I bought, the more taxes I could raise, the more improvements I could sell, and the less maintenance I would pay. Life under Celtic communism was grim: all work and no play for both me and my citizens. But we had peace, we had security
Slowly but surely I had driven the Americans from our lands, as these were all large cities and close to their capital, This meant they were prohibitively expensive, costing upwards of 10000 gold to incite, and double that to subvert. It would take me ten turns per city, at least. 
This is when I just said fuck it and nuked the remaining cities using spies. I nuked all remaining cities in one turn

TL;DR I bought up all enemy cities in about 100 years.

I know lua, and I am really good at any scripting languages, however, I am un-experienced with Garry's Mod modding so I would like assistance by at least one person, and for it to be complete, we will need a mapper and server host. Here is a list of people that are required for this.

At least 1 fellow programmer

We may need a modeller and a programmer familiar with weapons modding in garry's mod

At least 1 mapper, as garrysmod does not have very large map support, the map should only contain a few key cities, as well as the central disputed zone.

Server host: I can currently host a debugging server

Maybe Garry's Mod isn't the right game, inexpensive game, with a lot of support for modding, and to be fun it only requires a few people to play.

I would prefer you have a skype account, we can use steam, to add me, my skype account name is drewlark99

1349829435.0,1183tq,My own long session on Civ III: Play the World,lucasliso,174,20,37,"When I read Lycerius post

Anyway

Let me explain: I'm not a big Civ player (I kind of suck if I ever try a hard difficulty level), and also because, as I said, I'm not that big a Civ player.)
I started a game in Civ III Play the World in 2007 (6 years ago) and I never actually ended it

I also play on and off, and I'm afraid that I am living a ""Tense Peace"" Cold War kind of game, and I'm sure a global war is in the next corner, most likely this century or the beggining of the next one a war will start. And after reading what happened to Lycerius, I'm afraid of what might happen if I keep playing.

Because, I was actually going to start a war. But after reading about The Eternal War on Civ II, I didn't start the war, and decided to see how long I could keep the peaceful world going, in other words stay AWAY from starting a war that would last for centuries. And now I realize that I can't, at least I don't see a good way to do so.

The game went like this (there were two major wars so far

The map is one big continent west and east, which I used to control but lost that on the last war, about 500 years ago. There were originally 5 civs (counting me) now there are only 4. It was me, using Carthage, then there were the computer controlled Koreans, Mongols, Spanish and Celts. The Celts were the only ones to be wiped out (I know

The Celts were the only big nation in the same continent I started in (the west) I controlled the south and they the north. I basically wiped them out during the start of the Industrial age, and have about the same amount of land there each one, with some edge over the Koreans. There are two smaller continents, kind of like big islands would be more accurate, I control one that is next to the south side of the West continental side, and the Koreans controlled the other one completely (until the last war, which I'm getting to).

Before Nukes were developed, the first global war my session had seen (the one with the Celts only involved me and them).

I had an alliance with the Mongols, so it was all involving tanks and planes and boats. I wiped out the Spanish and Korean Navies, and landed some troops on their shores south of the east side of the continent, and on the island that I did not control (controlled by the Koreans). Then moved some troops through the land bridge which was then under my control.
The war did not end well, I lost the control over the small bridge of land.

Also

The remains of my navy were able to stop them, I was unable to land troops on their land, and they managed to capture the one city I took from the Koreans on the island to the west since I couldn't get reinforcements in time (my transports were toast by then), so that Island is now controlled entirely y the Koreans except for that one single Mongol controlled city.

My two cities on the South side of the East continent remained my only land gained

When mine and the other Civ's troops were spread too thin (plus I had riots in my cities and once in a while production was halted because of Anarchy from the fall of the government order), but it was devastating politically.

I decided to just keep developing until there was nothing else to discover or develop, and me trying to keep the peace for as long as possible after learning of Lycerius 1700 year old war.

My civ, parades and special days are celebrated all over, all cities are developed and have a high population.

But the other three remaining nations (Koreans, plus I have the satellite to protect my cities from attacks, and they do not.

They really, the Mongols, the Koreans and Spanish also all have defense treaties with each other that get renewed right as soon as they expire, so I know that if I attack just one of them, another world war will erupt. No matter what I try, they just hate me, regardless of how many gold I give them, or whatever we do

I wasn't thinking much of it at first, which was nice, but the whole ""Humane Thing To Do"" discussion, and YouTube videso and the like.) I now have my doubts of what is in my future. I don't think I can make the peace last. And its not just because of the hate of the other three nations.

You see, regardless that I have only Solar Power plants and recycling centers in every city. Also there is famine, not because of war, but because my population is so big, that even by owning half of the world, I still don't have enough food resources to feed all of them (and I can't trade for food with the Koreans, Spanish or Mongols because, they hate me).

My economy, I still keep loosing more money.

I could have more money, tanks, battleships, submarines and everything else (well, not all, but a big chunk of them), but I'm sure that as soon as I do

But I have to do something
If my super big population does not start dying from famine all over

I know a war against the other three civs will give me the money and resources I need to keep my economy afloat and food storage full. But that would go against the point of me trying to keep the peace going. If I start a war now, its a bomb waiting to explode. I'm actually afraid of the consequences now after reading this Eternal War thing.

Sure I have nukes, I'm sure a war now would be devastating still.

At the same time, and more and more.

Again, it will have two results 1- it lasts for centuries and be devastating for everyone, or 2- The war does not last long because I wipe them out in one go, and now I'm in control of everything... devastated by a terrible nuclear war, after nuking my enemies 100 times... IF I start the war of course, which I'm trying NOT to, but again

And when I start the war, so its most likely that I would end my democracy, forcing me to go to a totalitarian form of rule, like Communism (most likely), just like it happened to Lycerius.

And then the front line will be stuck, they hate ME).

After reading other people's comments

Sure, sure my people love me (for now). But my cities are full of tanks, bombers, marines and nukes. The sea under my control is filled with battleships and submarines (I don't like using carriers that much).

So this ""Peace"" is only because I have deterrent weapons. And the stability is just like a house made of cards: built on a diminishing economy and food supply.
The other nations of the world hate me, I guess. But they hate my guts, and will continue to do so no matter what I do.

I'm at a crossroad

I'm afraid of what will happen if I keep playing, and if I don't come up with something in the next 200 years or so, my economy will be bankrupt and my food supply will surely not be enough to feed my huge population, and then what Well, start the war anyways... only more desperate for money and resources than how I am now.

I'm posting this because I view my 6 year old game as a ""how the whole mess got started"" kind of thing

What I see in my game is this: If Lycerius' Eternal War game shows a stalemate of war, my game shows that it seems impossible to stop that if you are not the only nation in the whole world.

Peace cannot last because the economy will colapse, I still would need the land of the whole world to keep famine from spreading to the billions of people that live in my nation.
Is that what happens? Is the Eternal War inevitable no matter what we try to do? Can Peace only be mantained if I kill and destroy my enemies? Is Carthage's only means of survival to kill the Koreans, a certainty? Is the world condemned to suffer hunger and thirst because no matter how stable, and developed a country is, the populance will grow still, and the world just cannot produce enough resources to feed them, even if we have farms and crops in every piece of land available for farming? Can I feed an ever growing population for a billion people in a world that, even at maximum production and farming

On the other hand
Since I was on my way of starting the war before I ever found out about the Eternal War scenario

2519 AD: The War starts. I use about two thirds of my nukes, are the ones that get striked the most. I also nuke the island, but not as much as the mainland. After the devastation of the Koreans, I attack the Spanish and Mongols. The Mongols are the ones thatg get destroyed the less of the bunch. After the nuclear strike ends, I take Gergovia and raze it, then move my troops on the land bridge that connects both sides of the continent.
The counterattack: The Mongols move their fleet and attack mine on the north, 3 of them submarines and one Battleship). The Spanish on their part attack my fleet on the south, they sink one carrier but otherwise they are destroyed. The Koreans move what is left of their army and start attacking me, I loose some of my tanks, but I keep them at bay. Their nuclear counterattack is constant, but I have satellite defense. Of all the nukes they throw, only 4 of them hit
All in all
Every inch of land on the Western continent is now a warrent radioactive wasteland

2520 AD: I Build Gergovia Novo, this will work as a fort for my invasion and as a ""Panama Canal"" for my ships to have easy access to the north sea from the south. I move my land troops, I loose some but the Koreans loose more. I take Seoul and keep it. The Mongols make more incursions on my north sea, I keep them at bay but loose two more ships. The Spanish remain out of my sea space, but move towards my two cities on the southern side of the Eastern contienet. I repell their attack, and I move my troops to take Cheju, Ulsan and Namp'o. The Korean army is now virtually gone from the mainland and so is most of their fleet close to my land

2521 AD: I did not expect this! The Mongols betray the Koreans and declare war on them, Ulsan and Namp'o with ground attacks, I fortify them with several tanks. The Spanish move towards Tingis. The Spanish declare war on the Mongols, since they had a mutual protection treaty with the Koreans.  All the cities that were or are in Korean hands are now just a bunch of rubble, filled with the survivors of the nuclear attacks, and those are suffering from famine. It'll take a while to rebuild once the war ends... if it ever ends that is.

2522 AD: The Political unrest started on many of my cities, but I do it anyway. The Mongols attack fully, I'm unable to repell them, they take Ulsan and Seoul from me, they are moving towards Gergovia Novo and also Pusan. The Spansih take Tingis from me.

2523 AD: The battle on the seas rage on. The Koreans are gone from the mainland, that just keep comming wave after wave, some nukes get past the satellite defenses and it helps a lot). The Mongols also strike from the north sea. I use my remaining ships there and sink them, but not before they are able to sink my two transport ships, there goes my plan to invade the island. I nuke the island some more to keep them low, but its mostly out of frustration from loosing the transports.

2524 AD: My government falls into Anarchy. This is bad, I cannot make more units until order is restored. I think I'll choose Communism once that happens, otherwise this scenario will repeat itself again and again, and I'll start loosing ground. The Mongols take Pusan, but fail to take Gergovia Novo, I retake Ulsan from them. The Spanish move towards Pusan.

2525 AD: The Mongols are repelled completely from Gergovia Novo. I take the opportunity and retake both Seoul and Ulsan. I fortity them as much as I can, didn't take that long for them), but fail to retake any of the other cities I took before. Sea attacks seem to have ceased now, I remain on the defensive there as well.

2526 AD: Reinforcements of the Mongols come towards Seoul, except to fortify Tingis (maybe they are fighting the Mongols on their border nowm, or are planning to take Malaca, I'll wait and see.) 

2527 AD: Still in Anarchy, the riots in the cities are getting worse, and some of my infrastructure there (like banks and such) are getting destroyed by angry mobs. Nuclear winter is starting, and the north side and south side of the continent gets covered in thundra. I use one more of my remaining nukes to attack the approaching Mongol troops, but fails because of the satellite defense. The Mongols attack Ulsan but not Seoul, but are kept at bay. The Spanish move, they don't take Malaca

But the greatest feat of the Celtic Democracy is their tireless work to keep the borders between nations quiet and the Fucking Vikings, transports, Mechanical Infanteries and Stealth Fighters works year after year to keep the peace and fortify the border. But see for yourselves...

[The Celtic borders](http://imgur.com/a/TFE1s)

This is indeed not the future I had hoped for, but then from time to time the unit limit would be reached, and since I didn't want to constrict the other civilizations in building units (I thought that to be unrealistic), I loaded a year before and disbanded a couple of spies when that happened, so only about half of those remain. 


**The keys to peace**

The most important things I learned in this game were:
*1) To live in peace you need the UN.
*2) If an attack should come, Greek and Sioux territories (at Izumo, Athen, Killdeer etc.) where you have a mixture of your own and enemy cities. So either take the enemy cities or give up a few of your own. I took option one, but option two might make the nations more evenly matched and the game more interesting.
*3) Spies sabotaging cities work great if you don't want to take their cities away
*4) Nuclear Weapons are indeed a deterrent. I tried once to disband the nuclear missiles, I'd rather keep the nukes and the forced peace.
*5) If you want to drain the swamps you need A LOT of time. In the turns when I had the most engineers, but 70 or more. Although in these 2.5 hours the buying of city improvements is already included, so if you have fewer cities, either because you took less enemy cities or founded less new ones of your own, this is faster and you would need less turns to drain the swamps on your territory.   


**What's the sitch?**

So far the Vikings have been content to attack the other nations with their navy

[an example of Viking incursions](http://imgur.com/EG07N)

Luckily (and to my great surprise and amusement) they tried out a Democracy for a short while in 4296 and they disbanded or retreated most of their units from my territory
Now how did I get here? Well my goal was something like this, the other nations still alive and coexisting peacefully. 
But I guess without the United Nations the Vikings aren't that good at peace, so I enforced that border too, at least the seaway. The air units I mostly bribe away, since the money is capped at something around 70,000 Gold. 
For me however the United Nations were the one thing that allowed me to make peace


**The way so far**

As fas as general strategy goes, don't waste the oceans...), baracks, defenses, markets etc.,  but no more offensive units. A few Mechs, maybe a Stealth Fighter, incite a revolt in Birka (Adam Smith's Trading Company is a great help in the beginning) and the other towns on that continent. It was beneficial here to bring a few mechs along to defend my new towns, they'll reach their goal. This takes a bit of time

[moving through enemy territory](http://imgur.com/vSY3M)

Then I got the towns around Athen and Killdeer, new pollutions were very rare. Once the pollutions were cleared up I started draining the swamps. 
Since in a democracy a city which is celebrating the ""We love the President Day"" grows as long as there's food around
So I  changed to a Democracy (the year you start the revolution should be dividable by 4, but since I build harbors and a supermarket, the cities survived without a famine.
These engineers drained the city-square first, another engineer and so forth. Parallel I incited a revolt in Jarlshof and the towns westward of it and expanded with new cities, since it would be a shame to let all these special resources go to waste. This also took care of the Celtic Independents, since upristings never start in a city radius. 


**Reclaiming the planet**

To drain the swamps, and then sent two engineers to work. One can use more engineers per square, but it's less clicking and button pressing this way. 
For terraforming mountains, eight would stay in place (the laser) and charge the ninth one up, the next turn the ninth one (the beam) would go to whatever needed to be terraformed and another engineer would take its place. This way a mountain can be turned into a Hill in two turn with three packs, aka 27 engineers and so on. How to charge up engineers, read this, it helped me a lot :)

[Infos about settlers and engineers](http://apolyton.net/showthread.php/20497-Info-Settlers-Engineers-%28GL%29)

For working in unfriendly territory, one fighter usally looses and it's rare and only if the AI had time to build up units that they send more than one fighter. If you want to be really safe you can build a fortress first and send additional Mechs, but they aren't really necessary. (Related to this is the super stack, invented by Xin Yu, where you use one Mech, one or two bombers, four engineers and whatever offensive units you fancy. First you build the airbase, then you build a fortress. The next turn you destroy the fortress with the defensive unit

This piece was written by XL_Monkey_Turban

The distant sound of gunfire woke the Consul, savouring it, fearing the dreaded knock at his door. The Consul was a small man, roughly five foot six, his pale skin speckled with freckles and moles, his hair had fallen out at the age of 15 living next to a crater left centuries ago, a permanent scar on the land. Growing up on an irradiated algae farm, he became a weak and frail child, where he was groomed and trained to Govern. He displayed two important traits of Governance: adaptability

Consul Brennus Koun still showed the scars of his childhood, as if he were plotting a dark scheme, fantasising about the chaos it would cause. Rolling out of his lavish bed, a concrete slab with a blue plastic sheet and a bundle of old clothes to act as a pillow, Brennus began to cough, a hacking noise that tore the back of his throat, spittle and blood gathering in a small pool as his convulsions slammed him onto his hands and knees, leaving him naked, his breath rasping like sandpaper against the floor.

A polite knock at the steel bulkhead followed by a young child's voice. ""Message for Consul Brennus Koun.""
He tried to speak but his breath caught
Brennus cleared his throat and managed in a horse rasp; ""Come in"" before breaking down into another, revealing a fair-haired boy that looked the age of 9, his face smeared with dirt and ash, his wode barely visible under the scum that caked his visible skin.

Upon seeing the broken form of the consul, and ran over to help him. ""Sir, are you hurt?"" The child glanced at the Consul before blushing and looking away again. Brennus couldn't help but chuckle. A weak smile graced his face and he beckoned the child to come closer, whispering hoarsely into his ear to fetch him his water by the basin opposite his bed. The basin was, like everything in the room, made of concrete, with a small shard of glass roughly 10cm long and narrowed to a dagger-like point acted as a mirror for the Consul, and below it, needles and transparent bottles were arranged in neat, before leaning over the majority to take a empty one and pump it full. Once that was done he rushed over to Brennus

Brennus spoke, commanding through fear. ""The white one's.""
The child fussed for a moment, the child returned to him with a small plastic sheet with circular white pills inside, which he popped out one, tipping his head back, eye's closed, he threw it into his mouth, his head slamming forward onto his chest, breathing heavily for 10 seconds before jumping to his feet, so were all of us""

Walking over to the basin, standing straighter as he did. He swallowed a blue pill, accelerating his thinking to a post human level, and only then did he seem to notice his nakedness, walking over to a steel door on the opposite side of the room, opening it to reveal a sparse wardrobe, taking out a matte black pair of trousers, a dark green baggy shirt followed by a royal looking coat, a compound fuel model

The Consul glanced down at the child
""Promise not to tell anyone?"" He had a slightly patronising tone, ""Go fill these up, son, make sure your family get some."" The child nodded, more eagerly this time, grabbing the two bottles and stuffing them into his belt and as he turned to go, Brennus grabbed the back of his shirt, eager to return home with the bottles of clean water.

The Consul poked his head round his room's bulkhead to watch the young boy run off, the Consul screwed the cap off the foot long tube, tipping the paper out onto his hand. He lay the tube on his bed and unrolled the mysterious message. He sat down as he read the thin parchment, it was brief, but no less important for it.

this all started [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uyswv/here_it_is/c4zw944) with me wondering how to first tackle the problem and what would be the best way to end the conflict

But what were the decisions that led to that advance? I will expound on them here:

First you must realize that Civ 2 is a great game but within the confines of governments and the styles you can take it is really restrictive, Lycerius, in his great wisdom has left the game as a communist state, this decision might seem weird to a lot of people, but here's why. You would all probably say that the best government is republic and/or democracy right? Wrong. Within civ 2 republic and democracy are based on an already matured civilization changing from an inferior political system to them, in effect they require the necessary infrastructure such as temples, marketplaces and especially a great irrigation system to work

The remaining governments are as follow anarchy, fundamentalism and monarchy. Anarchy is the base state when no taxes, or science can be made, some production occurs but under heavy corruption, discarded. Despotism and monarchy fail from the fact that they are extremely similar even if monarchy is a step up it kinda fails in scope and is not really, in my opinion, an endgame. Despotism is the lesser form of government highly corrupt, etc. Both discarded.

This leaves the main contenders for this enthralling dystopia, not any so it's cool, it has even a better approach at settlers in that as a heavy workforce they are still not expected to eat as much as their democratic counterparts making engineers only eat one food instead of 2. Because of the horrible effect global warming has had on the world food is extremely hard to come by and this makes communism extremely viable.

Finally we reach fundamentalism it has the specific advantage, furthermore as you are planning the conquest of 2 huge nations it would be in the best of your advantage to have a system of government that makes sad people happy right? Under fundamentalism no unhappiness occurs. This is largely offset by the fact that all scientific progress is completely halved, a bad thing right? As you read before all possible tech has already been researched, so there is no actual downfall to this government. The only fly in the ointment is the settlers food intake that as republic and democracy cost 2 food. But it's a small price to pay for the best military in the world. This is the government I took.

Economically the country is fine due to a complete lack of science structures in the celtic country even the smaller cities produce more money than they consume. So by selling some unessential structures you can have enough money to buy a beachhead deep within viking territory

It is extremely important to buy the cities even if you can take them militarily

For the rest i will post my original response to Lycerius:

There was a period where I played Civ 2 as a banana republic dictator named Enrico PhearMe, anyway) was a classic dictator in the mold of Sasha Baren Cohen's latest creation: brash, jovial, covered in medals he never earned, with an insatiable hunger for cocaine.

He had a grand palace in his capital - which was usually named Fear. This lead to the delightful naming conventions of wonders, The Colossus of Fear.

In one particular game, populated only by the French. Now, I've got plenty of... history with the French in Civ. They've always been a thorn in my side. But Enrico was magnanimous: he offered them peace, trade, and a couple of lines of his finest Colombian.

Initially

The scene in the president's office was idyllic: the bright, and walked purposefully to a hidden closet.

He carefully removed his general's outfit, naturally.)

After he had put on the appropriate garb, PEACE. The other, WAR.

He threw the switch.

Later, and giant plates of the finest blow were provided to maintain the festive atmosphere.

1339566209.0,uzdt3,I just played ~5 hours of The Eternal War. Here's what I have to say about it.,slug_man,109,41,43,"I streamed a ton of it. No cheating
http://www.twitch.tv/s3xyl3xy/b/321264178

When I started out, a lot of gold, and the swamps issue to deal with. I looked at all the cities I had under control, and to be frank, Lycerius was in a VERY good position to destroy the Viking menace.

* 1. Don't feel overwhelmed.

Lycerius had a LOT of units set to sleep. Wake them up and get them geared towards the primary objective: Those rotten vikings. They've got a lot of howitzers, but frankly, once your battleships suck up all the damage from the ICBMs, you're in good shape to take down the vikings. They had a lot of stealth bombers too, but the fact that every major base has a SAM site, they're not an issue.

* 2. Every base needs a harbor

One problem that I had right off the bat was the CRIPPLING infrastructure in place. With every major landmass covered in swamp, get engineers right away to fix the swampland encompassing the entire map.

* 3. Fundamentalism is the way.

The big thing that fixed everything was running a revolution IMMEDIATELY and switching to fundamentalism. No more corruption

* 4. Nukes? What nukes?

I did not get hit by a single nuke while I was rushing the sioux or the Vikings. I was hit by a lot of ICBMs, it was a very downhill battle where I was calling the shots and there was nothing left to fear from the voracious Viking army.

* 5. Alliance with the Americans.

BEST. DECISION. EVER. It was clear IMMEDIATELY as soon as I loaded the save that the Americans were the dominant army in the game. They had me surrounded with helis, fundamentalists, and mech. This game would get a lot harder if that alliance didn't exist. Please treasure this agreement and after you take care of the vikings, you can basically do whatever you want.

* 6. Sioux? What Sioux?

That's right

**TL;DR Thank God for America

Here's what I have so far: It's 1969, at least as far as Roman sources can determine. Which, you could say is a good thing as there are so many Mutual Protection Pacts floating around that if one civilization went to war, nearly half of all civilizations would end up in a bloody battle.
City life is excellent in the Great Roman Empire. Democracy is abound. The people are hedonistic and spoiled with how lavish their lifestyles are. But, but expansion is at a stand still. The president wishes to go to war and conquer China, the smallest nation on the map (4 cities. I'm not shitting you), but he knows of the drastic consequences that would follow if he did that.
On occasion, Rome is still very small. It takes advantage of whatever land it can get in a desperate attempt to expand, because the president knows that peace can't last forever.

So, I can't get in.

As of right now, we have Mobile Warfare and Radio.) The uprisings in Yakutsk and Tbilisi were successfully squashed, but Kiev still rages, and the possibility of a Communist Uprising by 1917 grows near, bringing with it an interesting parallel with actual Russian history. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has undergone multiple revolutions since the late 1800s, going from Despotism to Monarchy to Republic to Fundamentalism in only a few years. Their empire is crumbling

Update 1: In 1919 the Russian people revolt and a Communist government is in power by 1921.

Update 2: In 1925 the Japanese committed an act of espionage to steal the secret of mobile warfare from us. I responded by attacking their fleets gathered outside my territorial waters, and to make matters worse the Chinese have allied with the Japanese. Also, Democracy in Japan has failed, and a Fundamentalist government has taken over. While the Chinese Monarchy hasn't declared war on me yet, I assume it's only a matter of time before they will.

Update 3: In 1932 the Japanese surrendered after my navy destroyed several of their vessels and devastated the coastal city of Nagoya with my marines. Now everyone is at peace.

Update 4: It's 1946. A strategic alliance has been formed between The People's Republic of Russia and The Republic of China. Japan's fundamentalist government was brought down in favor of a Republic as well, has made its great undertaking the building of a United Nations building. However, India is amassing a huge armada of battleships, cruisers, and transports outside my territory, leading me to suspect that they may be trying to make a power play by attacking me. They are the second largest civilization behind mine, and second most powerful militarily

1947-1957: I hit India with a pre-emptive strike, as I suspected the massive armada India had been gathering was indeed to attack me, as several Marines launched an amphibious assault on my capital city and cradle of the revolution Kiev. By the late 1950s the war was over, with India having the United Nations broker a cease-fire agreement. (Also, during the war, India had two revolutions: one instituting a Fundamentalist government and another soon after the cease fire had been signed returning India to a Democracy.) I destroyed about half of India's naval armada gathered near my country, the rest retreated. By about midway through the war I had completed The Manhattan Project and I used a nuclear weapon on India's most populous city Hyderabad to send them a message: Do not mess with Russia. Now my alliance with China is on shaky terms

1957-present day (1975): There has been no major confrontation between any army, only having life support, solar panels, and 1 unit of fuel. While no country but China wants to be in a formal alliance with me, I've noticed the Japanese and the Indians have become friends. It may become a 2vs2 situation where the Chinese and Russian armies fight together to crush Japan and India once and for all. Plus, I did nuke India after all, they probably have not forgotten that

* Find where your armies are
* Make sure that your cities are working their best squares
* For the love of god
* Mid-tier cities near water should get a Harbor quickly.  More population = more production = good times.
* You have more money in the bank than you should
* To fund this massive instant production

&gt; Library/University/Research Lab: There is no more science

&gt; Courthouse: Provides no benefit to Communist governments besides making the city more difficult to bribe (very rare).

&gt; Sewer System/Aqueduct: If it's obvious the city isn't going to climb to pop 7/12

&gt; Cathedral/Colosseum: No need to have these on cities with populations lower than 5-6

&gt; Supermarkets: Extremely pointless

* I prefer swapping all Armor production to Howitzers, and are cheaper to build (which is major in an ultra-low production game like this).  The mobility loss is minor due to the clusterfuck of high movement squares anyways, and you should still have some Mech Inf to provide the actual defenses.  This is obviously a personal preference though.

* Careful with long-range automoves
* If you are going the mass-Engineer route to get the planet back to livable, due to the low population, unless a city is absolutely surrounded by pollution or a valuable square is blocked, I wouldn't waste your limited number of workers trying to clean it up.
* Make sure any city producing Engineers isn't going to drop into 'Hunger'.  All you'd manage to do is waste your production when the Engineer dies due to lack of support anyways.
* Also make sure any city building Engineers is larger than size 1

The only things we still need to really do is get some main things down. If we're doing this, and a few theoretical designs for the Vikings, but if we want to pull this off legit we need to settle on things.

Things that I can list off the top of my head would be...

* Faction-specific weapons

* Weapons that all factions can use

* Character design

* What kind of game we'll be having

* How the game will be made (mod for older game, game engine like Unity or Unreal [examples of great Unreal games built on the UDK website found [here](http://www.unrealengine.com/udk/)])

* Who'll be doing what

* Playable Faction/storyline for each faction

* Sounds/Voice acting (it'd be cool if we could get Lycerius to actually voice a character for the Celts)

* Map design

And lastly...

* Publishing/Kickstarting

**Prologue**

The sounds of a screaming woman where muted by the rushing cry of wind and sand knocking against the rotting walls. Tattered and dirty sheets pretending to be curtains flapped in and out of the window, and the radiation only made it that much more dangerous to be out in. The radio had warned the region of it three days ago. It would likely last several more days still, but at the moment it was the furthest thing from Paul’s mind.


He stood outside the bedroom door of a two room shack. On the other side the screams kept coming


“She’ll be fine boy.” Paul looked across the room and met the eyes of Stanley Ericson


“I know sir, “But I still worry. The pregnancy—”


“Is like they all are son


Paul nodded, and the steam from the cabbage stew rose up in a heavy wave that caressed the kettle hanging above it. Paul put the poker back to the side then stood silently to watch the flames. 


He must have dozed on his feet because the door slamming open behind him nearly made him stumble to the floor in surprise. He spun around and caught Margaret rushing towards her husband, but didn’t even get a word out before Stanley ushered her back into the bedroom with the words, “Just get them cleaned up.”


Margaret disappeared again, both dead and bloody and Stanley didn’t want him to see them that way. He felt tears starting to burn in the corner of his eyes, and when he opened his mouth again to question his wife’s father, the words caught in his throat. He didn’t want to know suddenly.


“It’s a girl.” Stanley stated then


“What?” Paul croaked


“The baby


Paul lifted a hand to his mouth and let out a relieved laugh


“And Anna?” He asked.


“She’s fine boy


“I don’t understand


“That is the damn problem! The baby Paul


Paul still didn’t understand what his father-in-law was getting at. He took another step forward, jerking him closer. They stood face to face now; the older man was nearly a foot taller despite the curve in his back. Paul could see a hint of spit leaking from Stanley’s cleft lip, and he swallowed, fighting off growing panic.


“The baby is perfect Paul; she’s got nothing wrong with her.” He paused, cause if it ain’t me and my girls I’ll have to take you out back right now and shoot you and don’t you dare lie to me cause I’ll damn well know.”


Paul swallowed again, you and the girls, always. I’d never betray Anna, never, never her or my baby.”


Stanley nodded, she’ll be wanting your support.”


Paul nodded but said nothing more. He walked past his father-in-law and up to the bedroom door, the fear was wholly justified if what they were saying was true. He had to see it for himself though. She stepped to the side and let him in, and he walked to his wife who was lying in one of the beds, her brow soaked with sweat and the sheets beneath her still stained with blood and afterbirth.


The room was too warm and had the heady scent of blood, and nestled inside the cloth he could see the pink skin of his new daughter. Her eyes were closed, and her cheeks were ruddy. She was beautiful. Neither of them spoke as they stared down at the child they had created together.


“Your father


Anna nodded


Paul met her eyes. He had always thought Anna to be beautiful, tumorous legs she couldn’t stand on. The wheelchair in the corner was hers, and her younger sister sat in it dozing. Aside from the legs and thinning hair though, Anna was as close to perfection as anyone could have come in Chicago, but the baby… Paul lowered his eyes to her, then reached out and lifted away the swaddling.


Ten toes, at least, the girl really was perfect. Only time could tell about mentally, but still, physical perfection was as dangerous as anything else these days. He tucked the cloth back around her.


“What if they take her?” Anna asked


Paul wiped away the sweat on his face again as he thought about the government units nobody ever really spoke about, “I won’t let them.” Their eyes met again, “I swear it to you.”

(Important Note: In the Celtania figure

What I totally missed was New Vikingland, the Siouxs. 15 million people call Celtania their home, 5,26 million Americans exist and 5,17 million Vikings (goes up to 5,43 million) are present as of 3991 AD. In addition, there are 110 000 Siouxs.  

Now, total destruction of arable land, melting ice caps etc.) one can assume that the population didn't recover.

It's pretty blurry, we can say that the population of what in the 40th century are Celtania, New Vikingland, America and Sioux were (rougly) 150 million + 51 million + 52 million + 1 million at War's beginning. The 90 % death toll the first ten years equal 140 + 46 + 47 million + .900 000 = almost 234 million deaths the first ten years. 

Now, nukes included. I do not count enviromental factors, such as post-nuclear blast fallout (which is everywhere, mind you). 

Now, or 1.352 billion total deaths. Celtania and Lycerious have bore the worst number, with 845 million. America and New Vikingland each have taken around 235,5 million deaths. Sioux numbers are neglectable in this calculation, since they've not been touched majorly.

Adding the inital 234 million to the 1.352 billion makes the revised grand total casuality count of the War (tl

1586 million people, from start to 3991, the point of the save game. 

This poses a good challenge still: Can someone lead Celtania to victory while avoiding the 875 million dead mark (the 58-year solution would, which result in 876 million dead, just barely missing)? Can someone pick up the pace for Vikingland / America and avoid 250 million?

I'm not going to pretend to be eminently well-informed about the ins-and-outs of game development. I'm just as much a noob as the rest of you. But here's the blunt truth:

* My lowball estimate for devtime in man-hours on an RPG by a professional team is 500
* Even attempting to do something like that is downright silly - anything approaching a full-blown RPG, code, scripting, things that cannot be cranked out as quickly as dialogue and story can. (I say this as a writer.)

The only reasonable path to take with that information is to scale down the project. Massively. Sure

1. I think we can all agree we like RPGs. So let's keep that. Let's keep an RPG system at its core.
2. But let's pare it down to combat - really
3. AI is fucking hard to write properly
4. Writing net-code that can handle real-time multiplayer is really hard. Let's go turn-based.
5. Writing a game engine is really hard. Let's find one that has a lot of the work done for us. Unity3D is a good choice here

Now I can write, program and texture. (Quality in that order.) I'd be willing to contribute a good chunk of my time to making this a thing. On that note, I have a [RPG system](http://refugerpg.blogspot.com/) in development that would be pretty ideally suited for this setting, and would only be modestly difficult to implement (compared to d20 or GURPS or something).

tl;dr: An RPG is way too complicated for a small volunteer team to complete. We should make a one-map

Good Evening

It has come to the attention of several members of this station and the party that there is rumors of another nation outside of our conflict, my brothers, for the remnants of the Sioux nation exist in radioactive wastelands and there is no threat for the common Celt! 

Please

Even if they DID exist

A minor bulletin, I enjoy a joke just as much as anyone else but c'mon! 

News and rumors of a 'flesh eating pathogen' in Dublin and outlying regions are false

Glasgow's own Sinead Higgins, says Doctor Edna Gilmore! 
About time

And now

Same conditions as before. Possible break in ash storms later today. Insect swarms on the coast are expected. Hazardous gear is advised.

I watched the clocktower strike thirteen as the sun came to spread its bliss across the ashen ground. The acid rain lay in pools, marching over the landscape and across the horizon before disappearing under a fuzzy line. Even without my glasses I saw the gas mask cladded men turn their back on yesterday, peer out into the ruins and the dark soil where their wives and husbands would cradle their knees. Even miles away, even through fog and nuclear mist, even through the patches of rain, even through the remains of the trees and even through the condensation of the glass on their gas masks I still saw those cries. Those tears. They were turning their back on eighteen years of their life, to fight once again for “Peace

Beyond the hills and the crackled mountains, and we were lucky to get any bits back at all. The cannibal gangs that hunted the endless drones of vans that came back to the ruins, they were always struck upon.

The war, and died, and I wondered if at some point when I ventured into the mass graves I might have picked up the bits of them. While wading through the marshes, with the damp rising radiation just tingling away at your body you begin to feel something. Even as you pick up the bits of rotten flesh, wipe away the fleas and look into the dirtied bloodbits you wonder if you know this piece of mankind. If you held his hand, or played and hide and seek with him in the mornings, if you grew up with him and played games and found worms or if you skipped with her, and soon the great glorious nation plunged her into a suit and threw her down the valley of death. I was left behind

The clocktower struck again, just before he was slaughtered, about what he had heard. About what little scrap of information he could get out of his shell-shocked great-grandfather, one of the fabled 'Hundred Survivors' from a battle long ago. He had dragged himself out of the atomic mud and, with only his arms left, dragged himself back to kiss my great-grandmother. He was hung for 'Cowardice' by a visiting Marshall.

My great-grandfather had told my big brother this: “When I came to the focal point, these Celts...” He paused for a bit, taking a few heavy breaths. “I saw this two-thousand... three-thousand... this eternal war all suddenly gain a little perspective. There are piles of bodies, and the stench rips your nose. But, I realized something that day. I realized that there's no such thing as a future anymore. There's no such thing as history.”

He reached down to my big-brother's level

“Do you even wonder... the names of our country? Do you ever wonder my boy why we don't have names too? It's because we're just fodder. Just meat for the immortal grinder. Chewed by a machine... you'll be gobbled up too by the 'war effort'. There's no point fighting it. The only thing we can teach our kids today...” And my great-grandfather was apparently roaring in tears now

I had happened upon the grave digging job by complete accident. The previous grave-digger died of old age. Some of us called him the luckiest man alive. The torch passed to me, so it could all be melted down and fed into factories to produce more rifles and metals, so it could be fired on some foreign field into some foreign man. Then it'd decay into the ground, be flushed upwards by the water and picked by me decades from now. I picked up the bits of flesh I could find too, run them back into the ruins and dump it into the graves. Landfills even. One giant sign written in rotten ink: 'UNKNOWN'.I hear the sirens call in the distance. It's the end of curfew. The enforcing Marshall Snipers wander into the street, one of them rips the bedsheet off the dead child. His mother comes running, they grab her by the hair and yell obscenities. They start to gather round, and I know the signal. I nod.

Mass rape is commonplace. The Marshalls visit now and then, he slaughtered the children and then took his own life by breaking his own curfew. I remember carrying his body to the landfill, trying to picture just exactly what made him such a hero. He could've pillaged the women of the place, he could've been rotten and keep the status quo. Instead, he didn't flee back to the city centre where the barracks and the bureaucrats lay. Instead, he decided to do the kindest thing possible. When I threw his grave into the hole of flesh mess, holding my mouth with a handkerchief (the smell could make you vomit for weeks) I thought of his growing up

-----

Even as a child, I imagined his crooked nose and mighty jaw.  I saw clearly his sandy hair and deep, soulful eyes.  He appeared just as my mother had described, so many times... so many years ago.  He still wore the uniform of Celtania, though stained as if he just returned from the field.  He beckoned for me to follow, just as the brothers in blue always said he would; I followed dutifully.  A soldier always follows dutifully.

-----

I moved slowly through the ruined warehouse, laser-guided submunitions spalling the plascrete behind me.  Having narrowly escaped the fusillade, I ran for the stair at the far side of the building, hoping to get a vantage from the rooftop.

I could hear the horrible machines below, they were drones - machines we knew to have human ""pilots"" somewhere behind the battle line, perhaps even as far away as the American capitol.  I felt a great need to see for myself, though it could easily mean my death.  I mounted the roof and carefully glanced over the kneewall from as low a crouch as my gear allowed me.

There were men in grey fatigues, swaying their ""heads"" side to side in (what seemed altogether too purposeful) a scanning motion.

-----

There was a great fire the night before the final assault on the last American bastion, but that has never held true.  After all, the Viking Horde was the spark that set the whole world ablaze.

Ages past, harrying the coasts of what once was Europe.  While the other nations occupied themselves with arrogant posturing, the Vikings - ever men and women of action - launched the first strike in what became a World War.

The nuclear devices in London, Washington, and Tehran all went off within moments of one another; a marvel, considering how long the secret was kept... how long did each operator lie in wait for their order.  The world spun immediately into chaos.  The world's governing bodies immediately set upon each other like ravening beasts:  St. Petersburg launched Russia's remaining arsenal immediately at their old enemies in the United States, mutual destruction assured by retaliative launches.  The power vacuum in the Middle East was brief, the struggle ending with the entire region under blackened glass.  Europe fared not much better as the bombs rained down on every city from every side.",,,,

Capt. McChrysler, 1stLt Julestone, is monitoring all communications' wavelengths for the order to advance. We have held this post for seven weeks now, long enough to observe the transition from the cold autumn months into the full-on snowing season. The morale of the men has gone from verbally irate to silently depressed. We are all completely tired in every sense of being; mentally, physically, and emotionally. 

When we first arrived I was proud to tell them we were going to be the front line. Proud to explain how we were the primary offensive that would cripple the Celtic empire. Now I see my folly. The first word we received via the wireless broadcast was of dissension within the capital. While we were marching toward the enemy, so I no longer uphold the punishment. Then we had an unexpected turn of events only three days ago. Reinforcements. Granted, it was only a squad of six men, and they were the most inexperienced group of nubs I've ever laid my eyes on, but I haven't been so glad to lay my eyes on anyone since I first met my wife. They were led by Cpl. Kirk, who was ordered to fortify the front and await further orders from the Battalion CO, meaning myself. And with their CO awaiting orders, there doesn't seem to be much more to do than hurry up and wait. 

I've decided to man the evening reconnaissance watch myself with 1stLt Julestone as my spotter. Scanning the horizons, and desolation. Suddenly a fleeting glimmer catches my eye. My optical implants are within calibration parameters and there was definitely something picked up by my infrared. I switch to passive thermals and the horizons still appear clear. 

Without warning I hear

I whip around asking, standing in front of Julestone, is Kirk. And he's chuckling. 

""M..mm.Mack...""

""Jules, as I've already switched my optics. As if I couldn't tell by the glow in his eyes, I can see the ionizing radiation streaming off of him. And I know precisely what this means. This cocksucker has a bomb. And he's arming it.

I've been thinking a little, shoot, kill as well as men. And in a world where any single advantage could mean the war is won wouldn't make sense the 3 remaining faction to give all they can, trying to get that little advantage that could make them win?

Greater numbers in the front could most definitely make the difference between victory and defeat.

I think it makes more sense that those unable to fight (men or women) sick or of younger age to work in factories (who needs education right?) while the older (18+ or maybe even 16+) and able to go to arms.

Surrender. Think of this in real life terms, as I landed Drengin cruisers filled to the brim on unsuspecting planets, that I was killing billions of people. It made me rethink my strategy, and I think it could be applied to Civ 2. Rather than invade I usually try diplomacy or culture. When someone invades me, if I can't protect it, I surrender the planet - because regardless of side, the battle still costs billions of lives. The stakes aren't quite as high in Civ2

His CO and half the platoons of his division had taken to calling him Lucky Lucifer, a sixty foot flight out of a wrecked APC, enough radiation to kill a radroach, much less live to be thirty-eight, without the luck of a devil behind him. It seemed he had done it again; he felt the familiar pit in his stomach as he looked around to see his platoon decimated by what he assumed was a Viking Gullveig fire bomb. Or maybe a M33Howler; it had been hard to tell the bombs apart for the past few months after CIC operatives infiltrated Viking factories nationwide and poisoned food supplies in an attempt to kill workers. That loudmouth ThreeDog on Great Nation Radio said the covert operation was an overwhelming success but the half dead Engineer platoon could tell you all about how there are still plenty of munitions coming out of Viking factories. Half of them don't even explode and the other half do damage in ways that would make even an old man like Lucky Lucifer have nightmares. But he had made it out again, and with little more than a radrash and a bloodied headpeice. He had a half-dead assembly line to send another fuck you card to. Just another crazed worker in a factory across the Iron Wall...

He knew if he stayed in this death pit much longer he would get to meet the pyro-squads who swept the marsh on a five hour basis looking for stray CIC agents migrating from city to city, murky water for high ground, he got to a knoll tall enough set off his last flare and wait.

Ten minutes later, he'd give more if he had 'em. Lucky Lou raised his rifle above his head in recognition and a smile broke out on both of their faces. Griffeth knew he had another Lucifer story to tell his CO buddies. At that, the familiar cackle f the Ull-12 sniper rifle echoed the swamp. Griffeth felt the bullet scream by as it pinged off the front of the tungsten hide of his Runner; looking up with a bigger smile at Lou. The smile had melted of a lucky man's face as he looked down at his bleeding chest. Right through the heart. He dropped and a hell of a fire fight zoomed across the blue sky he was now forced to look at. He knew what was coming, and didn't call for help. He knew he would be just another casualty. Just another body to burn. Soldiers no longer had the dignity of burial since the homeland ran out f solid ground to bury the hundreds of soldiers being sent home in boxes.

Keeping the Vikings contained should be comparatively easy with a good foothold on their island of seven cities (picture 3) and a front line that has not moved for years (picture 1).  You have two thin narrow corridors that you can play '300' in and hopefully keep the situation fairly static.

In comparison, so infinite moving railroads can hit them the moment a new unit is born (missed this in later Civs).

Lycerius says that the stalemate is so tight that all he can build is tanks. This is what he needs to do. 

OPERATION (post below a name for it)

STEP 1)   Whenever lycerius is in control of the cities that change hands frequently build tanks in those cities and in one of your port cities begin to construct troop transport ships. Whenever possible (and not endangering the war effort) put aside a tank or two to load onto these ships. This could take hundreds or even a thousand more years but is necessary if you want to defeat the Neo-Vikings and 'muricans.

STEP 2)     After you've put aside a force large enough to take an enemy city put all your ""special ops"" onto transport ships and attempt to take over a city. Thus should work for two reasons. 
1) I don't believe you can nuke ocean going vessels and
2) it's conceivable that your two opponents haven't had enough spare resources to build a navy.
If the capture of the port city is not successful then repeat. If it is successful move on to step 3

STEP 3)    Once you control one of these cities one of two things will happen 
1) they'll nuke there own city and will have one less city to construct tanks from which is good for Lycerius OR

2) The opponent will realize how precious each city is and try to retake it. This would cause the country to be forced to fight a two front war changing the dynamics of the game. 

My hypothesis is that whichever country you choose would soon fall leaving you to defeat the final opponent. At this point you would hopefully seize enough of the dying country to give you the edge over the last enemy.

Gabriel Collins was an exceptional young man. He was born in the Inner Capital to a wealthy family and exceled in school, dreaming of one day being a high-ranking general, leading the American forces to victory and finally wiping out the Vikings and Celts. Since he could not enlist until he was 18, he attended a special academy and began training as soon as he got out of school. The world might be a devastated wasteland at this point, but the Inner Capital along with New Chicago and Seattle, which house the richest and most powerful men left alive, are still sprawling cities that provide some glimpse into the world that could have developed if it weren’t for the war.

Now, overseeing the captures of the most important cities. While this usually means fighting on the front lines and assaulting strategic settlements, this time was different. The target was a small city, which under regular circumstances wouldn’t have bothered anyone. However, after a few hundred years under Viking control and for the first time since the war began, yesterday at dawn it was captured by American forces. As a part of a new strategy, the generals need to capture as many cities as possible and send in specialized scientists accompanied by guards to investigate and search for a way to grow vegetation in the swamplands which now cover most of the Earth.

Usually, but you can never be too safe. In that window the specialized scientists scour the city, which is more than enough time. However, yesterday’s capture proved to be an anomaly. It started with the scientist calling in a “4057”, which means an object of interest has been found, and continued with the Vikings assaulting the city within 8 hours of losing it. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that there is something that the Vikings don’t want the Americans to know about this place, and that’s exactly why Gabriel’s squad was transferred for the attack.

The Viking offensive was swift and decisive with heavy casualties on the American side as the soldiers were basically on break. Most of the rifles were out of reach, so the counter-attack shouldn’t take much longer to start. Now that Gabriel arrived, the commanding officer, Sgt. Haysem, estimates that within 3 hours the troops will start entering the city.

Gabriel’s squad is comprised of five men, most of the times splitting up from the rest to provide cover and intel from afar. They are almost identical in every way, and take turns between each mission on shooting and spotting.

Brad is the main gunner, leaving him with 3. Finally, Snare is the technician and the smartest one of the group, usually handling anything technological. However, he can still hold his own in a firefight and in fact might be the best shot other than the twins.

The group arrived at the camp in high noon, and the final checks on the unmanned drones were being made. Haysem points the squad into a large tent on the far side of the camp, and tells them he’ll be right there.

Gabriel enters the improvised command center to find men hard at work. It is mostly set up, who attempt to hack the local Viking networks or intercept their communications. 

“Snare
“I’m sure they’ll figure this out

A tall man approaches the squad and introduces himself as Peter
“Come this way
The room has a large desk in the center with 7 seats around it. The squad sits down just as Haysem and Peter enter the room

“Alright

It is shaped like a square, no more than two stories tall.

“You can see that the city center sports a fell skyscrapers. Those were built during the war and can withstand a head on ICBM hit. As such, which means nothing can penetrate them without leveling the whole city as well, so out only option is to go in from the entrance, climbing up floor by floor”

“Can’t we go in from the top?” Interrupts Brad

“We wish there was another way, which would paint them as easy targets for the AA. Back on topic, your job will be to go in and assist the capturing of those towers.”

“Great

“Don’t worry

“These are the ruins of a mansion. You probably heard about the code 4057, but you must retake the area and secure it to let our men uncover what was found yesterday. High Command suspects that the Vikings recaptured the city so quickly just because of that mansion, and the fact that it is heavily guarded is a testament that they’re right.”

“Wait

“Of course not, giving orders from your spot and assisting the assault with suppressive fire. We also managed to get a few tanks from the front lines just for this operation. Is everything clear?”

The five soldiers looked at one another worryingly. While they always split up on their missions, they all realize that this is a must, and that the twins will be of no use in storming the towers, so the all agree.

“Great” continues Haysem “we will leave for the towers in two hours. Harvey and Donald, go outside and freshen up, we need all of you at your best. Dismissed!”

Those who survived the frequent nuclear blasts were the unlucky ones. At the age of 15, drive and fire our tanks. You enter the tanks a thousand miles from the very front, which is then sealed shut, entirely self-sufficient. This became your home for the next few days. And eventually, your coffin. 

The tanks were small, greener and greener soldiers being sent to the front. The amount of training received had, over the years, become less and less. 

To amend this lack of training, testing and mental conditioning. They, unsurprisingly enough, were wrong. But nobody ever made it back, to tell of the idiocy of command’s idea. When you get into that tank, you do not leave. You trundle along, if lucky

The tank’s interiors were sparse. There was a single bunk, going off to die on the front.  Cabin fever very quickly set in. Tempers would fray. The atmosphere inside that metal box deteriorated quickly, soon becoming almost as bad as the political atmosphere of the three nations. You would soon hate your two companions, with every bone in your body. Only the ever present mile counter would keep you straight, constantly ticking off the miles travelled, counting towards your death. 

Inside those boxes, while rich in oxygen was almost overbearing with the chemical purifiers they added in to cycle the air. There was the risk of a leak from your fuel cells, which could easily poison all three of you. The food was prone to spoiling fast, and while nutritious, tasted bland and encouraged nausea. And the chemical toilet…don’t get me started on the damned toilets. Overflowing faeces was the least of your worries with those toilets. 

Your outcome was dismal, us into military training. Them, who knows. Certainly none of us. 

We were the unlucky ones. The ones whose lives would be thrown away. The ones with no names. The ones history will forget. For who is writing the history books? Certainly none of us. I am just another nameless Viking

As I write this, another tank. To our right, another tank. In front of us, tanks. Behind us, tanks. As far as the eye can see; tanks. I lie cramped in the bunk, quickly penning this. But nobody will ever read it. There will be chance. For by nightfall, all of us will be dead

[ Log: 13:30 May 2nd
  “This world in arms is not spending money alone.  It is spending the sweat of its laborers,” spoke an aged man, as a half burnt cigar smoldered between his fingers. 
“And I’m going to guess that’s another one of your beloved quotes Halifax?” snapped a younger man
“It is, I don’t think even you can argue that? Can you Renault?” 
“Of course I can’t old man!, rations have been low. Child starvation is back above 50% and you don’t even want to know how hard it was to get these smokes.”  Halifax did not respond immediately. Instead, he simple looked at Renault, his eyes fixed, not in anger over his friend’s remarks, but sadness.  He drew a long puff from his cigar. It was a decent blend nearly as the natural one he had sampled years ago. Halifax had to admit it was a kind favor to bring him one. It was kind of Renault to converse with a man like him at all. Finally, he opened his mouth to speak
 “I’m not talking about the November offensive, I am talking about everything, the very state of our world.” Renault’s eyes narrowed at this remark. He generally liked the old man despite his eccentricities, but comments like this always managed to find a way under his skin. Vague, and dangerously philosophic, they reminded him why Halifax was an outcast. Good comrades did not have time to ask such things, especially  not when the vile Vikings were attacking once again. The young man attempted to request explanation, “This war, before the great floods.” Renault’s mouth dropped. This was too far. He had heard stories about the World Before the War
 “Where did you learn that?” demanded Renault.
“In an old geography book  that has been re-transcribed from a text dated to the 2300s. Truly it is a gem of a find
“ A book!” balked Renault, his concern for the old man was evident, “If they found out about this… The Great Lycerius’s mercy can only be tested so far.”  Halifax extinguished his cigar and rose to his feet.
“I am a Preserver, and it cannot be abandoned,” replied to old man reciting the creed of his secret order. 
“Your Charge?” shouted Renault incredulously, Renault’s mind flashed through images of rebel corpses paraded across the news. He always found the thought of Celt killing Celt to be deplorable.  Granted, those men and women had risen against the Party and hurt the nation, but they had seen their children all die to feed soldiers and their supplies cut to build tanks. He often wondered if he would have done the same if he had been in their shoes. The Party had its faults, but whether they rose with guns or mere books, those who rose in defiance were always struck down. Halifax was a strange man, but he was also a good man. He had always been kind to him
“ Halifax, and they would sure as hell cart you off if they found what you had been doing.”
“I’m not so sure that would be the case my young man, “I can’t believe the wise Great Lycerius would waste such a precious resource as a Preserver. The party may never admit it, but they need us. They need what we know, and I would wager my life there are a few of my cult in the Party Councils. Knowledge, of all things including the past, is needed in war Renault. It is needed as much as  soldiers and bullets.” Just then the television sparked to life and the two men turned to view the official bulletin that had halted their debate.
As of 13:45 today, of our proud nations combined military. The High Advisor has already let troops to victory countless times and had already devised a  plan that will bring the Celtic People glorious victory. With the support our stalwart American allies and the continued guidance of our beloved defender and servant, The Great Lycerius, we had conqueror the wretched Viking hordes and finally claim our rightful place as lords of a peaceful world. Duty and courage my brothers and sisters, all honor to our people and its party!
The screen returned to its former blackness, something alien. It contained a true glimmer of hope. Did this new commander actually have a plan to win the war? Is such a thing even possible? Renault looked at Halifax as if to beg for some insight. The old man met his glance and answered, simply “I don’t know.” Victory, the word echoed in Renault’s mind. It had been chanted more times than he could count, but it was never more than a dream; a fantasy. The thought of victory and peace as a  reality was beyond comprehension. For a brief moment, Renault let his imagination drift off into these musing until he remembered their pervious conversation and jerked back to focus.
“Well even if we do finally win this war
“Son, and the Preserver’s will hold the tools needed for this tasks. Besides Renault, I don’t really believe I am going to be turned in anytime soon.”
“And why not?” inquired Renault, but if you think I would face the prison brigades to keep your secret you’re…”
“Oh I severely doubt you betray me
“And why not?” barked Renault
“Because my friend if you condemn me, they were true. I have told you many things, volumes of ancient knowledge, and you have remembered them all. You are yourself now a master of history and guilty of the same crimes you accuse me of committing.  Renault, you are now a Preserver. Welcome to the Order.”

I noticed a flash in the sky. Not uncommon

A wave of whispered warning moved up the crowded yet silent street, as it must be against such heathens as the Americans with their Man God, their undying president, and worse still, the godless Celts.

As their chosen one walked among us
He was merely a few days old. On the day of the Choosing

First, as I knew no child of mine could be a vassal of The Trickster. After Loki's vile spawn were dealt with, a True Son stood before me and my child, still nameless, and gently lifted him from me. 

A hunger pang again jolted me to the present. Maybe it was the nature of my journey that made me so unfocused today. Wiping away a tear of joy at the memory, to the temple.

My hunger persisted, yet the lazy and the infidels stole it from us, meaning everyone had to go without. The True Sons had it worst, going for months without food, so we were told by their spokespeople. They did it for us, and the time had come for me to do something back for them. For the greater good of everyone, to save the realm of the godly from the evil.

I entered the temple, held in position of great authority. Each god had his or her own statue, and each had different building at it's base, dealing with each aspect of life. Odin and his raven dealt with Matters of state- only the True sons went there. Loki and his serpent's tongue dealt with traitors and spies. I myself had turned in many, I remembered with pride.

 Thor and his hammer were for the glorious military. I knew my time had come to give everything for the gods. I would go into battle under their protection

But suddenly, as suddenly the the temple began to come crashing down around me. The statues fell slowly to the floor and as Thor's hammer came down, my final thoughts were that I would be in a better place, soon.

A reply to the Celtic chairman Lycerius

Year of our Thor AD3991 June 12th

Transcript as follows:

Deputies

The so called leader of the Celtic nation has addressed a telegram to me, actually received this document, the rest of the world had already been informed of it by radio and satellite reports, and numerous commentaries in the organs of the communist world press had already profusely enlightened us as to the fact that this telegram was a very skillful tactical document, designed to impose upon the states, in which the people govern, the responsibility for the warlike measures adopted by his criminal communistic administration.

In view of these facts I decided to summon the Norse High Assembly so that you, I considered it desirable to keep to the method of procedure initiated by chairman Lycerius and, for my part, to inform the rest of the world of my answer in our way.

The theocratic Norse nation wants peace because of its fundamental convictions.  And it wants peace also owing to the realization of the simple primitive fact that no war would be likely essentially to alter the distress in our world...  The principal effect of every war is to destroy the flower of the nation...  The Norse nation needs peace and desires peace!

Whoever lights the torch of war can wish for nothing but chaos.  We

We are all proud of God's powerful aid. We have become once more true Norsemen!

The world will not help, whatever man may do, holds in his hands the final decision. Lord Thor, let us never hesitate or play the coward.

Struggle is the father of all things. It is not by the principles of humanity that man lives or is able to preserve himself above the animal world

If today I stand here as a revolutionary

Now, I thought would give him my autograph as a souvenir.

Lycerius is the most bloodthirsty or amateurish strategist in history...  For thousands of years this man has been chasing around the map like a madman in search of something that he could set on fire...  As a soldier he is a bad politician and as a politician is an equally bad soldier.  The gift Mr. Lycerius possesses is the gift to lie with pious expression on his face and to distort the truth until finally glorious victories are made out of the most terrible defeats.  Lycerius

The first result, is to prepare the public opinion to regard the Celtic encirclement policy as necessary and, consequently, to support it, should the worst come to worst.

The Nordic people, and our coasts are rendered unassailable by any enemy power.  In the west, the strongest defensive work of all times has been built.

But the deciding factors are the unity of the Norse Nation as a whole

Now. As I mentioned at the beginning, - the world was informed of the contents of a telegram which I myself did not see until later.  It is difficult to classify this document or to place it in any known category.  I will, therefore attempt, Gentlemen, to present to you - and so to the whole Nordic people, an analysis of the contents of this amazing document and in your name and the name of the Norse people to give the appropriate answers for it.

I.

Mr. Lycerius states that the world is plainly moving towards the moment when this situation must end in catastrophe unless a rational way of guiding events is found.

He also declares that I have repeatedly asserted that I and the Nordic people have no desire for war and that if this is true

Answer: I should like to point out in the first place that I have not waged any war but simple defense; in the second, of warmongers; and thirdly, that I do not know for what purpose I should wage a war at all. To defend oneself is to wage peace.

I would appreciate if Mr. Lycerius would give me some explanation in this regard.

II.

Mr. Lycerius says further that he does not speak from selfishness, but with the voice of strength and friendship for mankind.

Answer:  If this voice of strength and friendship for mankind had been raised by the Celtic nation at the proper time, the Dictate of Heliopolis, could have been prevented.

III.  

Mr. Lycerius stated in conclusion that the heads of all great governments are in this hour responsible for the fate of humanity and that they cannot fail to hear the prayers of their peoples to be protected from the foreseeable chaos of war.  And I

Answer: Mr. Lycerius, is considerably smaller and more modest.  You have a modest population on countless square kilometers.  You possess a country with enormous riches, all mineral resources, fertile enough to feed half the planet and provide them with every necessity.

I took over the leadership of a nation which was faced by complete ruin thanks to its trust in the promises of the outside world and to the evil government led astray from Thor.  In this state are roughly 140 people to each square kilometer - not 15 as in the Celtic lands.  The fertility of our country cannot be compared with that of yours.  We are beset by swamps

When I took power

To protect them against the threats of the outside world, page by page, which contain the vilest oppression which has ever been inflicted on men and nations.

This I have done, I was an unkown worker and soldier of my people, by my own energy, and can therefore claim a place in history among those men who have done the utmost that can be fairly and justly demanded from a single individual.

It is your good fortune to sustain scarcely fifteen people per square kilometer in your country.  At your disposal are the most abundant natural resources in the world.  Your country is so vast and your fields so fertile

To conclude, the most sacred sacrifice the blood that a man sheds for this earth.

We, nor by hopes in toothless negotiations, but by force of arms.  What we have to fight for is the freedom and independence of the our land, so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the creator.  

Your sword will become our plow

So say we.

If I die here

So many have died in the bogs, starvation, disease, and the ever present radiation. The Cumanach Iberian State, our motherland and our stern protector, has sent us to this uninhabitable badland to hold the line against our wretched foes, the United American Combine and the Neo-Viking Moot.

That is, and blurred while being shuttled between one festering front line to the next. I have fought on every border that we still have, and they all look the same. The same stinking marsh, the same flooded and eternally collapsing earthworks, the same desperate and despondent soldiers. The only time anyone snaps to attention is when a commissar stomps by.

These men want nothing more than to survive their rotation and move back to the rear echelon, you have to raid houses, stop pedestrians, and walk patrols in restive areas. Light duty, until the insurgents drop a man in the street with sniper fire. Not a kill shot though, oh no. They only maim him, so he's screaming and bleeding out in the street, they know that's what the sniper wants. Their friend's screams demoralize them, and a nail-bomb soaked in rat poison goes off in their face.

No. Better on the line. There, sick of pointless war waged by a brutal government that takes your sons to die in battle and leaves your daughters to die of hunger and plague. On the line, you know who your enemy is, and the gunfire only comes from one direction.

Usually; can't forget the commissars.

Okay let's state the obvious so that's out of the way:

* The Vikings are incompetent an we have no option but to take them out.

* The Americans seem somewhat reasonable

* We don't know the possible ways to win but it's safe to assume that domination is the only option.

**Celts Winning**

* Celts make treaty with Americans

* Americans seem like the weakest of the big three so flanking them and nuking them or just overtaking they're civilization and using their resources and superior land positioning to have a much bigger front line. This would stress the vikings resources by having to face a 2:1 ratio of units. Keep hittin em' hard until you're superior resources prevails.

**Vikings Win**

* They take over weak Americans and death for the celst would be imminent.

* Celts focus too much on farming and the vikings are ale to march through the frontline. 

**Americans**

* I don't really see them as a major contender

What are you're guys thoughts? It seems like this is mostly a war between the Vikings and Celts. If anyone wanted to draw war maps detailing what they think Celts or anyone could do that would be awesome. I'm newer to the Civ games so I don't know too much about Civ II.

""Casualities are impossible to accurately estimate. but are considered to be at least a 90 % decrease in world population in the first years of the War alone, the population growth has stagnated at the latter number. The few scientists remaining estimate, given the increased birthrate (hovering around 3 children per woman, due to most women first giving birth very early, and many women dieing of childbirth, radioactive waste, and so on) that casualties annually hover around 500.000 soldiers, as they were the cataclysmic years that led to the 90 % decrease) means that a total of 845 million people have perished during the time. Adding 140 million from the first ten years gives a estimate of 985 million casualities since the start of the war in 2291.""

He sat alone in the darkness

The caves are haunted.

There was protection here, mossy steps away from the slaughter.

The Kelta would never follow him here, bent steel, and shattered bricks. The raiders would ravish their feminine spoils and offer the burnt flesh of the men to their god, Soshul. Inevitably, Soshul would go hungry as the raiders would use the charred flesh to satisfy their most pressing appetite. The Kernul (the cognomen used by all Kelta raiding chieftains who disavowed any other name on their ascendency to that exalted station) would then mark a concrete slab with the knotted cords and cross of the Kelta, declaring Cinnati annexed by the Kelta Soshulist Republik. The raiders would then move on, probably south to the swampy hills of the Kentuck.

The caves are haunted.

The thought again crossed his mind as his breathing quieted and his eyes adjusted to the darkness. He could see thick, he wondered? Did the ancients flee to these tunnels when the sun god crumbled their 'towers to the sky' into the mound of Cinnati Mountain? What amazing relics of ancient hubris could he find in these caves, abandoned for centuries?

His people weren't primitive. Though they lived migratory lives, heirs to the ancients. Though he had never gone further than the twin settlements of Indi and Apolis, he knew far to the west were great cities like Omaha, untouched by the ancient wrath of the sun god. When he was a child, he saw the might of the Confederation: giant silent beings, hairless metal skulls, only steely eyes peering through gas masks. Known as the 'Police' for their distinctive clear shields emblazoned with that name, a phalanx armed with an assortment of weapons from shovels to spears (railroad spikes attached to long lead pipes). 

Intimidation was their strength. The Confederation Police were bogeymen to enemies and Usa citizens alike. While the Kelta raiders armored themselves with random scavenged pieces of metal, shields, and armor remained in pristine condition; a testament to the Confederation's status as heir to the ancients.

But there were no Police here to kill the hated Kelta raiders who pillaged above. They had not been seen in the Ohio for over two decades, they said, and the known world would descend into the savagery and barbarity of the Kelta Soshulists.

The caves are haunted.

His subconscious repeated the fearful mantra as he sat alone in the darkness. He dared not venture into the dank abyss

He touched his wet brow, a few dozen feet away. Surely the Kelta would not be monitoring the entrance. There is no sense in remaining in this cursed cave. The caves are haunted.

He darted for the entrance

It must have been close to approximately eight millenia ago when I underwent my ""great nanotech overhaul"". Nanobots streamed over and throughout every millimeter of my body. It was quite a disconcerting experience. The entire process all but wiped out my prior identity completely. I believe it was meant to make me into a more efficient field surgeon. Or perhaps it was so I could retain more information as an engineer? The purpose of the operation escapes me. Too many other identities uploaded within my memory buffer cloud events of that distant past. In any case, survived. 

Fearful for a repeat of this incident, keep me hydrated. Additionally, using this same technique, they are able to provide me sustenance from practically any material I ingest, including soil. So, virtually, I have been rendered immortal. I reiterate the word ""virtually"" as I am certain an attack of sufficient enough damage, could render me deceased. Obviously

It was also during these initial wanderings that I discovered the residence which I inhabit to this very day. After several hundred miles of traveling I happened upon the mouth of this cavern. Deciding upon this place as providing adequate enough protection, I found one of the tunnels led into an obviously artificial cave system. These caves had been designed for a specific purpose and to service certain people. What this purpose was and who these people were, both were a complete mystery to me. There was no evidence of either contained within. Instead, the interface system simply contained instructions on the cavern's operation. The entire artificial cavern system used the Earth's mantle, which apparently is quite adjacent to the system, in order to provide power for the cavern's operation. 

Aside from all the necessary life-support systems and basic amenities, I can not say. I have, instead, programmed them for my own ends, which is serving towards the cavern's second purpose: complete historical cataloging. The memory banks contained here already had an immensely thorough catalog of Earth's history dating back to prehistoric times. It was most impressive. So I knew instantly I had a purpose for my newfound abilities. I set forth production on history cataloging nanites, Archivers, and historical artifact recovering nanites

They provided me with a very detailed history of the Celtic-Viking-American War. Very fascinating. However

But the Devil does not die so easily.  He found his allies in the Vikings.  He sent his demons to lead them astray.  He gave them to his spawn: the antichrist.

The Celts are another matter.  They seek the continue with the decadence and hubris that brought down Gods wrath in the first place.  They have refused God's light

Brothers and Sisters, who is three, had wondered where he brother had gone.  I had to explain to her that he had gone to take God's Purifying flames to the heathens.  That this is God's will for all men: that all Godly men serve Him as Purifiers.  Only by burning the bodies of the corrupt can we free the souls of the Damned of their taint.  I then told her that God's place for a woman is to serve Man: as a worker to equip God's Purifiers, as wives to serve their husband, and as mother to his soldiers.  A woman's job is much harder, but that is God's will.  

And so I leave you for the night brothers and sisters.  But I ask that you teach this hard message to your children.  It is vital they know why we fight.  For the hearth of our Lord and his purifying flames.  For our homes and family.  For our country

It's only fair if the boys who defend our faith get the most, right? I sometimes feel sorry for the armorers and clothiers who somehow get by with a loaf of bread a week. Anna, from across the street, comes to mind... God bless her and her frail body

Don't be scared. I can tell you're a bit shaken up. But it's just the reality of serving God and country on the battlefield. The Celts might be beyond salvation

The labourer beside him shivered


“Today our holy crusaders have taken another city from the Celtic dogs!” Shrieked the radio from commander Erik’s backpack

“And now our brave engineers will be laying highways for another conquest

“Strike down the heretics!” Erik and a few of the other Berserks echoed. Arnfinn was sick of the guards, to build roads that would be destroyed in weeks. 

“What say you?” barked Erik

“Nothing

“I didn’t hear you repeat high priest Eskil’s call” Erik stepped close toward the engineer, a crusade veteran and 14th generation Viking. Impressive.
“Strike down the heretics” Arnfinn muttered

“And you heretic dog?” roared Erik

“Strike down the heretics!” the labourer yelled
The Berserk sauntered off

“Poor man

Suddenly a distant boom sounded. Men fell to the ground under the shockwave and dust settled over the small contingent. Another warhead had been dropped. From Arnfinn’s experience it had been dropped less than 100 kilometers away and he sighed, but a number of the labourers broke down and sobbed. There was no hope for them, no medicine would be wasted on foreign blood and they knew it. Death would be slow and painful at the hands of radiation poisoning.

“Get to the trucks!” commanded Erik

“What about the labourers sir?” a rat-faced soldier asked

“Leave them to finish the job” Erik dryly ordered. 
At that the dark-haired labourer bolted toward the truck
A gunshot silenced the man and pieced the cold air.
Erik lowered his smoking rifle
“Strike down the heretics” he muttered.
“Strike down the heretics” came the chorus from all beside Arnfinn. He rolled the dead man over.

The words were crudely craved into the back wall of the lobby of - what used to be - a hotel. Colonel Bradley and I had been holed up in the ex-lobby for hours

We stared at the wall for the entirety of our time spent there, weighing them, studying them for meaning, both overt and symbolic. The words made a strange kind of sense to us, though we weren't sure why. I liked to pretend that people who lived before the war, as I had not, had the freedom to choose their own deaths. Perhaps one day, ""This is a fine day to die. I have always loved sailing, too

Then I thought about the death he actually chose. He had carved the words into the wall with the butt of his gun, as his next move could only have been to hold out his arms out and await his end, his corpse eventually landing not four feet from us, where the bones still laid.

His words, served as a eulogy for all those who fell after him, including me, whether I lived to see the end of the war or not. I was changed.

I looked at Colonel Bradley, and began to speak, uttering a single syllable of an unintelligible word before a disgusting SLAP sound stopped him short, and the side of his face exploded away from the rest, splattering against the wall.

Once we ran out of food, designed to minimize the suffering of the people who unfortunately were unable to receive their alotment of rations.  It usually took very little time for the crowds to disperse, because the people recognized the futility of asking for more than their fair share.

He woke as he usually did, then the other, adjusting slowly to consciousness in the poorly lit room. Things came into focus as he pondered if it was really possible that he’d actually slept his usual 7 hours. One had no true way of knowing how much time had passed unless you were in the heart of the building, at the Command and Control Center (CCC), where computers monitored the solar arrays, water flow and air filtration, as well as provided basic CCTV coverage. Today was one of the days Gregor wondered if perhaps the Generals were slowly shortening the time between shifts, day by day. With a groan he rolled himself out of his bunk and placed his feet on the warm concrete. He wiggled his toes as he tried to shake the grogginess from his head. Definitely feeling less than ideal. His duty shift was the last of the day, His fellow Northers in hydroponics had invited him to the labs where they were testing the first run of vodka they’d distilled in perhaps 12 months. A more experienced man might have known it to be vile stuff, it had hit him pretty hard. He didn’t remember climbing into bed the morning previous
The alarm finally ceased, and drew his jumpsuit from it's hanger. He stopped to glance briefly at the photo of his father, a wrinkled and fading piece of paper on his locker door. He touched the photo with the knuckles of his hand, then closed the door. He went to the locker under his bunk, and pulled out fresh underwear, arguably the nicest item of clothing he owned, made of a synthetic material that only recently the science division had re-discovered how to synthesize. Unbathed but dressed, and drew the curtain across his doorway, if not plentiful.
As he had for the past 6 years, and rapped it against the door, wincing as the sound reverberated through his head. A moment later the sound of a wheel being turned emanated from the hunk of steel, and it swung open with a well-oiled whisper. A shock of red hair appeared at the opening first, followed by a pale, slightly underfed looking face.
Siobhan would have been beautiful, I hope you're feeling right chipper this morning?' she put on a drunken-sounding Irish accent, as best she could imitate. She always argued she had the right since her ancestry was mostly of Gaelic descent. Gregor groaned yet again in response. 'Well that's a bloody good thing. The boys up top brought us down a lovely stack of work' She pointed to a hatch in the ceiling similar to the one in the floor. 'Unsurprisingly, SCARs don't take kindly to being humped around in the rain, tossed in the mud and then frozen! Imagine that.' (one more groan) 'Thus, we have the oh-so-glorious task of taking care of these poor, misused tools of destruction.' A wicked smile spread across her face, his inherited east-bloc accent made itself known.
“I’ve had stims and you haven’t! And I’m definitely not hungover, rookie!” She waved her arm vaguely toward a corner of the cramped room, where a work bench was cluttered  with various tools and weapon components, leaving only room room for one person to uncomfortably sit on the edge. A tall bottle and  two small white tablets sat in the center of that space.
 The smithy, and every possible surface was covered in weapons in various states of disrepair. Assault rifles of every manufacture lined one wall.  A pile of half-assembled Light Machine Guns lay in a corner. Pistols ranging from autos with CPU controlled sights to early 1900’s revolvers were neatly arranged in partially open drawers under the work station in the center of the room. And in the other corner, several grenade launchers of typical US Military heritage sat carefully disassembled. In the table in the middle of the room, 8 SCARs lay lazily piled, caked in mud, with rust showing in odd spots. It was a sad sight. He grimaced at that, and moved for the pills. Taking the bottle in hand, and took a draught of the filtered ground water
“Fucking commandos. They yell about being able to tack a man at 300 yards with any weapon they’re handed, he was straightening up the work area, grabbing tools from the various corners of the room, and organizing them in an orderly fashion. ‘If ever I was taken with them on one of their research parties, I would pistol-whip every man I caught leaving his rifle in the mud.’ Organization complete, he picked up the rifle nearest him in the stack. Siobhan did the same, listening as her standard wry smile remained fixed upon her face. Gregor paused his near-daily rant as he attempted to strip the weapon. He gave a tug at the loading mechanism. Nothing. Next, regarding it as one might regard a complicated jigsaw puzzle. Apparently giving up, but from which he could curse better than most men. Siobhan chuckled, and went to work on the gummed up mechanisms of the poor rifle.

1339545071.0,uyv1s,The Wastes - Short Story,HellsSniper,3,0,0,"I wrote a short story concerning the Eternal War. I tried Civilization II a few years ago and never really got into the game

    Year: 3391 A.D.
    Location: Five miles from the Front Lines

The convoy moved forward, the wind flying children’s kites. But now, their bones belong to the swamp, the trees belong to the wasteland. That was common around here, the front lines, “the wastes,” and “the wasteland.” It was the words that have spread since the first nuke went out.

*As I said earlier, America, Celts, and the Vikings. Every country had a starving population, spies, and the occasional uprising. A stalemate, an “Eternal War” as it started to be called a few hundred years ago. However

The convoy crept across the swamps, the Celts were a communist state.* Every man and tank moved at the same pace, none risking stopping in the irradiated swamps. That’s when the explosion hit. Three tanks went into the air, the men ran, and the other four dozen tanks drove into the swamps. The men were scattered, shooting wildly. *An ambush set up by the Vikings, their fifth attempt to overtake the Celtics after a peace treaty was signed.* The soldiers scattered hiding in any type of cover they could find. Not much when traveling through the swamps. The tanks began to go up in fiery explosions, and the little water there was in the swamp began to overflow with blood. And the Vikings were still nowhere to be seen.

*That’s when they saw the flag.* The Viking soldiers flew over the swampy hills, swarming them from every side. There was no escape for the Celtics, and everyone knew that. They began to regroup near the middle of the swamp, occasionally throwing out green smoke into the Viking lines. The tanks surrounded the Celtic men, only four hundred of the original 1500 man army. Two dozen tanks were left and began to rapidly fire at the charging Vikings, bodies flying every which way, blood scattering the hillsides.

The faint sound of helicopters approached the battlefield. The Vikings looked upwards, only used in dire situations.* Then, the HUD on every single soldier’s screen lit up.  It displayed one word: RETREAT.

That meant one thing; a nuclear missile was yet again launched on the “wastes.” No one cared about sides, and the soldiers began to run in every direction. The “wastes” had no SDI, no shield against the missiles. No hope for any men left out there.

The nuke struck the ground, and copter in the path. The men were disintegrated into nothing. The tanks exploded, and the copters crash landing every which way from the EMP blast. No soldier was left. No flag was seen. Only the bodies and machinery was still there, and they would be taken by the swamp, just as the others were. ",,False,t5_2ua25,True

Food was scarce, or on rare occasion to the military men who patrol by.  Sometimes I wonder how things are in the other nations, whether they too have so little as we, if they have to scavenge and sell to the military to get by, whether they have their brother’s taken away.

“We’re better off than most, although we never go up the stairs for fear it will fail to do just that. All the buildings are made of this wood, I’ve never seen new wood, my father has told me that it isn’t gray but a light brown or tan color, sturdy and structured, he says it reminds him of life, I wish I could see it.

On Dead Cold days my family sleeps in the common room with the fire, its too valuable to burn for heat, instead we burn livestock chips. The smell is bad, but the warmth far outweighs the smell.  I enjoy watching the flicker of the fire against the wall, it reminds me of the televisions that the cities have, only dimmer, it calms me and takes me mind from the cold and hunger.  Tomorrow is another recruitment day and we have to wake up early to take refuge in the basement, we can count on the consistency of recruitment days and the Dead Cold days.

**Notes:**

It's funny to see some people request a 'crash course' in CIV 2.  There is no such thing

The next ""Eternal War"" should be a ***Gigantic*** Map generated with the CivMapGen 2.1 utility, you just have to see one to believe how gigatic it is.

Hint 1: you can teraform the square under a city.  I like to turn the land under my cities into Hills

Hint 2: the AI always knows which cities have SDI, and let it be a ""bait city"" for the nukes.  I figure counteracting the CPU's ""inside info"" with tactics is only fair.

Hint 3: do NOT build Manhattan Project

Hint 4:  Building a city on an 'isthmus' creates a CANAL city between larger bodies of water

Hint 5:  My favorite build location is either a Pheasant or Grassland with a River (which you can Hill with ENGs later in game).  Building near Whales and Silk is also helpful.  You can build a city in the middle of 4 ""bonus"" tiles

Starting a Journal. I hope it will make the days easier to tell apart. John supplied the book

24/June/3967
Talked to John again today

29/June/3967
Keeping a Journal is hard. Am I supposed to write in it everyday!? I guess once in a while is fine... which i'm writing in the book

3/July/3967
John wasn't home. Liz invited me in anyway. She wanted me to tell her about the Low tiers I saw recently. She told me how disturbing the thought of them making it inside their perimeter was.
I told her I wouldn't know. She laughed

8/July/3967
My pen broke. Luckily John brought me a new one. 
I guess I should write Dennis into my journal. Dennis was shipped off today. He had been selected for basic training a couple of months back, I received a letter from him. It's not long, but it belongs here.. 

HERE GOES LETTER DO NOT THROW AWAY
“Byblos has been taken. We're sent to replace squadron LW954ZE42
		est. arrival time 12AUG67                                   Sorry”

I'm sorry too.

17/July/3967
I spend the night with John. As in I spend “SPEND” the night with John. It was incredible. As I was being taken through security to the inner city, and talked  and suddenly we were entangled in each others arms, it was incredible! But i´m feeling so confused now. We were just friends. His wife Liz had become more anxious about how much time we spent together, I like her! I don't want to disappoint her! Urgh, what do I do!?

19/July/3967
John came by again. Explained to him how I felt. He comforted me and told me it would all be okay.  He saw me naked in the daylight. Never again

21/July/3967
Apparently not embarrassed enough. Told him I was too skinny and looked horrible. He said he would bring me better food. I don't want him to think that I only wanted food. but...






28/July/3967
I didn't see John for days and started to get nervous

Even more Low tiers hanging around these days...

12/August/3967
Dennis made it to Byblos today. Don't know how I feel. 

02/September/3967
Not much time to write these days. I spend all of it with John. We spend a lot of time... doing “it”.
Haven't been with anyone else. The Threat that I might be able to have kids was always too much. But with John I felt like it was worth it. John tells me how Liz can’t have kids

14/NOV/3967
Things me and John have done in the last couple of months:
- Fixed my roof
- Made it so it's actually colder on the outside of the house
Build me an actual bed.
- Used said bed.

I love John. I think I always have. Every day with him is special. I don't need this journal anymore.
I think it helped.

01/Jan/3968
Dennis died back in September. Just got the letter. I just can't stop crying. I love John

21/Jan/3968
Me and John have both been feeling sick the last couple of days. I vomit a lot. John sometimes lie so still I think he's dead.

23/Jan/3968
John is dying besides me. At least we are going together.



NO ITS NOT OKAY I WAS GOING TO DIE WITH JOHN WHAT IS HAPPENING

NOT OKAY

WHY IS THIS HAPPENING

UGH I CANT MOVE AROUND MUCH SO WEAK

I’m pregnant. That’s why the low tiers hung around I think. They hoped I would so they could sell the information or something. Can't stop crying

This is how I die.

Staring down the barrel of a gun, listening to the sounds of gunshots in the distance, wrapping my jacket tighter around myself in a pathetic attempt to keep warm. And yet neither of those things are as unnerving as the sight before my eyes.

I remember the first time I saw the war. I had lived in a world that centered solely upon this endless turmoil for seventeen years, waiting for the day I died.

A second nuclear bomb went off a few days later

I remember the day my daughter was born. I stood over my wife, I knew I was losing her – that it was very likely she would never be able to see her own daughter.  But I held on to her, told her that we would raise our child together, that we would protect her from the terrors of this world. That we would be happy.

She died less than an hour later.

I remember the first time I killed a man. For food, and without hesitation I began to pound the dull letter opener into his chest, over and over like some macabre imitation of CPR. His arms finally went limp, and I greedily scooped up the can, intending to bring it back to my daughter. When I arrived back at our little camp, I handed her the can, and she wordlessly took it. Her eyes remained fixed on the ground the whole time though, placing it off to the side

We went hungry that night.

I remember the night my daughter died. Pressing my body up against hers, telling her that I would keep her warm, that she would be ok. More gunshots rang out in the distance, and I was forced to further dim the flames. When she didn’t answer me the next morning, I knew I had lost her too. Whether it was from the cold or the toxic air or the unending hunger didn’t matter. She was gone. I dug a shallow grave and held a short vigil. Then I was gone.

I can’t remember if I cried or not.

I once asked my father if this war would ever come to an end. He didn't answer me at first, in your lifetime, this one will too. It could be tomorrow. It could be in a year. It could be in twenty. One day though, you will know peace.""

At the time, lying on a dusty patch of earth in an endless marsh, I finally realize what he really meant.

There's a brief flash.

I think this is what peace feels like.

The state of the world during The Eternal War is incredibly fascinating to me and I think it presents either in part or in whole a great basis for a new universe in the gaming space. ( I would maybe change America to a different name as I doubt that for thousands of years the name would endure). 

Anyway when I read the article on Ars Technica the first thing that popped into my mind was that this would be an awesome MMO/Sandobox/Some Social Game kickstarter project or how awesome would it be if content could be created in various mediums to support this world. 

The second thing that popped into my head was that this should be an opensource project meaning that anyone could create/add to the universe in which The Eternal War is based on. So more products, games, hobbies, collectibles could be created and sold.

The owner/creator/inventor of the universe would receive 10% of any products made/sold/produced since it took him 10 years of playing. I think that is fair and would reward him for his efforts. 

This would basically be the opposite of the George Lucas way of doing business where everything is copyright protected and legal hammer enforced. The only requirement to creating additional products and using the universe would be the requirement to pay the 10% royalty fee to the original creator of whatever or derivative of the original work you are using. I don't know if that would be feasible. 

I guess the other option would be to just have the copyright/licensing last only like 5 years or so.  

I just think this is a really cool scenario and I am very surprised that more themed games like this have not been made. (Warhammer 40k isn't the same thing here btw) 

I think the most innovation comes when others take an idea and expand upon it. This could apply to other games/ideas as well.

The original player of the Eternal War stated that the AIs took part in a Space Race ""at some point"" - which means that a Unity-sized craft would have been launched with the ultimate goal of reaching Alpha Centauri.

""But wait, the game map and the timescale drastically different from Earth as we know it?"" What if I told you that dozens of nuclear wars, constant martial law, a worldwide dystopia, authoritarian regimes, several icecap meltings could have rendered a true history of the planet impossible, even down to the largest swathes of details?
