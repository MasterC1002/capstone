I don't post here often at all, I was ecstatic. Here was some quality amateur film-making featuring one of my favorite cryptids. Then, I found EverymanHYBRID and was once again highly impressed with not only their ability to weave a rich backstory involving many monsters from pasta but also the scope of their fan involvement. I haven't gotten into Tribe Twelve or any others yet, but I plan on it sooner or later. 

When Slender came out, a flashlight, a forest, and Slenderman. And that's all it needed. It was scary in its simplicity. Translating the Slenderman phenomenon into a game brought Slenderman to a wider audience and gave new and old fans a fresh experience in a different form of media. 

Some of the memes suck. Some of the memes are good. That fails to ruin Slenderman for me in the slightest. I still find him terrifying, and different exposures. 

Joel Schumacher made ""Batman and Robin"" and it turned out to be the WORST Batman movie ever. It didn't ruin the Dark Knight trilogy for diehard fans OR casual movie goers. Nobody avoided seeing the Dark Knight or any other Batman films because ""Batman and Robin"" sucked. That's how I approach Slenderman. 

Some bozo on Kickstarter may make a horrible Slenderman movie. If I think it

I liked this subreddit because it featured more immersion than the others

I come to you as a fan of good horror.  I have a fascination with the Slender Man, I believe my fascination is a bit more meta than some.  I am not intrigued because I am delving into some mystery, or that I may find something.  I am intrigued because I am helping to create a mystery.  I am a part of a growing mythos that has the potential to be something truly enduring, and it taps into a true human source for its horror.

Independent film makers have, here.  The Uncanny is best known from the concept of the Uncanny Valley.  It is a concept that describes the feeling we get when we are faced with something of increasing realism.  It was a term coined in robotics, and we can also directly see it in gaming.  I would definitely love it if each of you watched [this video](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/the-uncanny-valley).

Essentially, it becomes more adorable, more approachable.  Think Wall-E.  He has big eyes and expressive eyebrows.  This creates a character with a lot of emotional depth that never says a word besides ""EVA!""  We can empathize with Wall-E because of these subtle cues.  We can tell what he is feeling and feel it, ourselves.  It's how we're tuned as social creatures.

However, it begins to look more like a human with some very disturbing non-human characteristics.  Our senses of relatability and comfort drop off exponentially, even though it looks more realistic.  It really just looks disturbing.  It unsettles us because our brains are trying to interpret the thing in front of and compare it with how a human looks, versus when you look at Wall-E and it compares it to how a trash can looks.  When the equality in our brain doesn't match up, it freaks us out.  This is why people with deformities were paraded around in Freak Shows.  They gave people a little touch of horrific fascination by looking at something that was like them but very alien, at the same time.

The Slender Man touches on that point, and it unsettles us on an instinctual level.  The higher brain functions kick in and we try to reason why it is off-looking.  We hypothesize that it is something trying to camouflage itself; trying to look human, but failing in key areas.  This implies a predator and the baser brain functions again take hold.  We reason that it's trying to hide itself, a wolf in sheep's clothing, and that sends us right back to fight-or-flight.  This is the real horror reaction at work.

This is why Slender Man is cool to me.  It's not something real, or Smile.jpg.

Here we come to the point of this:

There seems to be a childish aspect of this subreddit that can never face the fact that the Slender Man is an entirely made up work of fiction.  To them, there is no historical evidence to defend his existence.  The wood carvings were long ago exposed as photoshops, as well as every single picture of him.  There is literally no evidence to back up the existence of the Slender Man.

What you people describe as Slender Sickness, you'll feel the same effect.  This isn't because those things are real, but because your brain is aroused (not sexually) to the concept of danger and your instincts begin to kick in.  If we weren't paranoid when we felt danger cues, we'd be pretty easy hunting for predators.  Mankind would've been eaten before they left Africa, if it weren't for being on-guard.  Problem is that it's a mostly irrelevant system in modern times, so we seek that thrill from artificial sources: enter horror movies.

I love the SlenderMythos, is really ridiculous.  It prevents people from examining the mythos publicly in a meaningful way.  If we can't be adults, for a second, and break from the game, then we can foster a really odd community of people who start to think it's real.  The concept of the real versus the unreal starts to break down and people get these weird paranoid delusions.  Also, if we don't have the power to shoot down people that are obviously just karma-whoring, then this subreddit will devolve quickly.

I'm more worried about people who think it's real and then make life choices based on that information.  That's my problem with religions.  If you turn down medicine at risk to your life because it's against your religious beliefs, child.  Pretending that you disappeared or trying to scare your parents that you're being stalked is sick, sociopathic behavior.  If you want attention, there are better ways to get it.  Don't manipulate people.  The problem is the delusional will run to the aid of the liars when their beliefs are challenged.  This is some serious Stockholm Syndrome bullshit, here, and it creates a downward spiral of delusion and shit content.

Post a picture.  Make a video.  If you put in honest artistic effort, if you come in here with some shit personal story, looking for attention, I will shoot you down as hard as I can.  I do not come here to be manipulated, I come here for good art.  Let's get that straight.  This isn't a support group for Slender victims, because there are none.  If you believe that you are really being stalked, seek help.  Now.  You are delusional and you need to see that.

This is a subreddit about Slender Man horror in art, or a video.  Put some effort into it or don't come to the fucking party.  I will honestly critique real effort, and be good-natured about it, but I will not brook this paranoid, delusional karma-whoring.

Thank you for your time.

EDIT:  Upon reflection

&gt;To them

I believe I run the risk of being misconstrued

Certain people can't willingly suspend their disbelief.  They are either very gullible, that they can't stop suspending disbelief.  They get obsessed with it and they start to believe that it is really real, as opposed to just choosing for a moment to pretend.  This is the Danger Zone. 

Then there are people who are attention whores.  There are way too many of these ""EHRMAHGERD SLERNDERMERN TERCHED MER"" posts for me to believe that all of these people actually believe.  Some people are just dicking around, etc.  If this were an honest attempt, it would be heavily criticized because of its poor presentation.  But since these tend to have a personal bent (""THIS happened to ME""), I am inclined to believe it is just an attention grab.  Because of this, my vitriol is much more than it would have been.

Then there are those who can suspend their disbelief, and then come back to the real world and sleep easy.  These people are the type of people this subreddit is for.

It is time that the issue that has been plauging this subreddit be addressed. Ever since ""Slender"" made the mainstream

The reality is that Slenderman is supposed to be creepy. He is unnerving because of his inaction. The fact that he is always probably behind you, wanting more and more. We want to know the secrets behind this being.

Slenderman isn't about jump scares

From here on out

**The following are banned from this subreddit**

* Meme Images

* Let's Play Videos

* Attempts to pretend to be slenderman. Slenderman does not use the internet.

* ARG's - You can post videos

* Self Posts - Write your stories from third person or from past events. Don't pretend you are being stalked

**All names have been redacted**
This is a measure put in place to prevent the ego stroking that has been occuring. This subreddit is about slenderman

I assure you these measures have been put in place to increase the quality of content that is posted here. Even if that means there is LESS content

If you have any issues, as we will actively be monitoring submissions and will remove anything that breaks the rules.

dream nor a vision or whatever. I personally 
thought it was cool so I want to know what you 
guys think.

  My dream starts off as I'm sitting in my room 
when the power goes out. When the power 
comes back on i find a note on my dresser 
with all sorts of slendy like drawings in it. As 
soon as i'm done reading it the power goes 
out again but when it comes back on hes 
standing in the corner of my room... I'm 
terrified but then he starts ""talking "" but 
its almost like his voice is telepathic and 
sounds of a child
elderly man mixed. weird. After an unusually 
friendly conversation with the slender man I 
find that he is extremely nice and that he 
himself isnt the monster  but yet he watches
 over and attempts to help against another being
... Anyway long story short we end up playing
 xbox and he rage quit his tenticals lifted my 
tv and through it out the window... the dream
 was quite interesting ",self,t5_2s4md,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Slender_Man/comments/yik1m/well_that_wasinteresting/

In December I was asked to be a part of a Messiah performance in a small town called Shelton. You may have heard of Handel's Messiah; it's the piece where the choir is singing ""Hallelujah

There were about five rehearsals before the actual concerts, too), and we heard it was going to be very foggy tonight. But I had no idea. 

My friend and I were pretty good fans of Marble Hornets, but I was pretty spooked at how thick the fog was during intermission. At that point in the day it was evening, and it was completely foggy out. I couldn't see past more than a hundred feet or so, possibly less, unless there was a street light or something, but even then the lights didn't reveal much. It was a cool effect.

I was walking to my car to grab some snacks my friend and I bought at the local Fred Meyer. I was walking alone. No one else was outside with me...or so I thought. When I get to my car

It was Him. The Slender Man.

He was standing on top of some steps in the furthest visible reaches of the fog. And he was staring right at me. Arms out to his side. Blank face. He was a good distance away but I felt like it was the end for me. In any moment I would begin to black out and then....well

I closed my car door and locked it, he can't get me, cause he only gets close to people who aren't looking at him.

But then he moved. His arm lifted up. His hand went to his face. And then...

A puff of smoke came from his mouth.

I realized then that this was not actually Slender Man. It was a tall, knowing that I was fine... But I still sprinted to safety back inside the building. That experience was even scarier than having to drive back home seeing only the first 20 feet in front of me!

I feel this was the closest I ever could have experienced Slender Man. The paranoia of what he might do to you is almost unbearable,False,self,t5_2s4md,1342711473.0,,,t3_wtjha

Slender Man was created by a young man named Victor Surge to the Something Awful forums. There was a contest going on trying to create a new myth

A lot of people claim to have seen him
Slender Man is a very abnormally tall man, because there is no face! It's the shallow outline of where the face should be. 
People have been obsessed with this man-like creature. It's a disturbing myth that people have loved since he was created. 

You may be thinking
Well

Slender Mans prey is very particular. He only goes for very young children or very old men and women. 

in the 1920's there was some sort of dementia patients home. I'm not certain of the name or the patients
The nurses who worked there complained of one women who lost her mind years ago. She usually just sat there in her little chair and slept. This person was VERY old and was on the brink of death
The lady
""The man! he's here!"" She would scream and throw books
One week later, there was a large circle with an X crossed through it. The circle appeared to be drawn out in blood.

Now

...What if the Slenderman DOES have a face

The psychological side of this is, whatever) the brain disposes of, or deletes, that memory, believing that it had never happened/been seen. This creates a type of amnesia, a lapse in memory.

Some remember more that others, although they are always humanoid.

I know this doesn't completely explain why cameras and such don't pick it up

I'm not sure... Just some random thoughts I had. :)

EDIT: After some comments, even though we are not seeing it in person. With my theory above, the mind would still find it psychologically harmful and erase it, causing the blank face we know today.

I've transferred everything here to [a blog](http://verisimilitudeproject.blogspot.com). 







I'm currently filming a dramatic web series (thus the username). I was taking photographs of potential shooting locations three days ago when I took [this photograph](http://i.imgur.com/Onf5w.jpg). I didn't see anything odd at the time

Last night was when the weird stuff started.

I posted the picture on facebook
That's all I remember until this morning

I don't recall any of it.

Checking on facebook a few hours ago

It seems you all know about this ""Slenderman"" and that it has appeared elsewhere. So







**UPDATE:**
I've discovered a picture on my camera that I don't recall taking. It was taken at 2:55AM this morning at my back door. 

This is bad.

[It's found me](http://i.imgur.com/ZJ0PP.jpg).


**Update #2**

Hllblzr310 gave me an odd, I'll let you all know.


**Update: Morning #1**

The camera hasn't caught anything yet. All the videos have been of an empty room

I had surprisingly normal dreams. I dreamt I was walking around the base of a massive ash tree

We'll see what happens today and tomorrow night.







**UPDATE: NIGHT 2**

The camera caught something last night.

Gotta bare with me while I explain some of this to you

A few months ago I got a few friends of mine into Slenderman

Summer was around and we all had free time

I had no real high-end equipment but I knew enough about editing videos to do it and we had tall friends that could pass for Slenderman from a distance. I got a new SD card for my camera and we started thinking up ideas.

Living in an area that had little to no forest was the issue. Finally we decided we could use some nature preserves and one of them specifically was the best. Its by the water and its pretty damn big

We were goofing around at first

Then we started to film. It was going well, small shit. Figured it was pretty cool to keep it in and added my own to it. 

The more the video went on the more I saw there were problems and finally I figured my camera was probably just old. That or it was broken from water damage. Told my friends what happened and we re-did it all the following day with a friend's camera.

We were doing good

I had to start signing up for my new school year and noticed a lot of odd shit. I couldn't use the radio in my car and my phone was useless. I kept feeling like I was being watched. 

I would get back to my car and I'd see scuff marks. There was one right on the back that looked like something just skid against it up and down. I blamed shitty drivers around and shrugged it off. 

My friends started talking about weird shit going on too.

We figured it was all in our heads. We went on to keep hanging out at the preserve to find new areas to film and one of our friends fell. We all figured he fell from being an idiot

The more we went on with the jokes

**Don't look for it. Stop it. We have to stop this project. I'll be back after I know its all done. Don't think about it. Don't go back to the preserve. I'll try to call you in a week.**

I honestly had no idea what we meant and figured it was another joke

I put the letter away and drove to the preserve thinking she'd be there laughing. Instead I found her backpack there with another letter and her things inside. It looked like she packed for a trip.

This one looked more like it was aimed at another friend

**Thanks for the help

Everything on the bottom was crossed out. She never left that letter for them to see.

I saw some drag marks on the ground and just packed her bag up and took it with me. I was going towards the rocks

No idea why but I thought it was her. I followed them and ended up sliding down one of the hills. I passed out from hitting my head pretty damn hard and woke up in my living room at 4am.

It wasn't even the same damn day

Going through it I realized I was feeling light headed. 

Then I woke up back at the preserve a day later. I had about twenty missed calls and another letter. This one ended short

Every ten minutes I felt light headed

Then I blacked out again. It was a few minutes before I made the account and I was at the local park. A few parents stared at me and I panicked. I checked for how much battery my phone had and I managed to type out to you all just in case and I ran home. I ran and locked the doors and emptied the letters out.

No light headed feeling at all. Nothing. I'm taking photos of everything including my car

One of the odd things that made me know it was him wasn't that I saw him myself

The video is wiped and all I got was a few photos. One of them is her and another friend and someone in the back,False,self,t5_2s4md,False,,,t3_xl6n3

 **1.**   Don't be a **Skeptical Twat**.   There is a lot of content that requires us to suspend disbelief.  While it's okay to be skeptical if it's done poorly

**2**    Reddit is a content aggregator. For submissions,000 members, but times have changed. For comments, avoid downvoting because you disagree with someone. Downvote comments if they either attack someone, or are not following the guidelines outlined here (namely rule 1).

    
 **3.**   Try not to flood the new queue with content. If you have a lot of submissions you would like to post at once

 **4.**   Before submitting something that you believe could already have been posted

    

**5.**    If possible, post using the “post to reddit” button, located on the right column of the deviantArt page. Alternatively, use the fav.me link.


**6.**    Please keep all content Slender Man related. A song on youtube that reminded you of Slendy does not really count



**8.**    Please use the report button if you believe a post is not appropriate for /r/slender_man. This lets the mods know very clearly that you would like someone to verify the post is appropriate. If a comment or post links something that’s extremely NSFW, or NSFW links are being posted. Report blank posts if they are derailing threads, or being disruptive.



**9.**    Encourage new members to read the sidebar and guidelines

**10.**    Memes are a ""sometimes food"". sometimes

His arms were long
I've never seen a man so tall
His arms reached out and grabbed me tight
I went along without a fight
I looked and saw he had no face
And then my heart began to race
He spoke to me without a sound

--

**March 4**

Today's case really gave me the willies. A warehouse on 194th caught fire and burned three people. Standard stuff, even the trunks of every car in the parking lot. Which begs the question: Where are they? What happened to them? We don't know. There was something, though. On the back of the door, the main door, somebody had definitely painted a circle with an x through it, in blood. And it had to have been painted there *after* the fire. Oh, one more thing: None of our cell phones worked inside the warehouse. Radios

**March 7**

Im currently in the national park outside town, the surrounds, the trees, anything we thought was relevant. I just finished looking through the images and every one looks shaky. Like two pictures were taken and they were just out of sync with each other. Our cell phones went out again, too. We were dark all day, nothing would work. Not radio, satellite

**March 8**

Day two in the forest, but not just jogging for exercise, they were *sprinting*. Running from something. Anyway, my growing paranoia aside, we found the first body this morning. It was impaled on a tree branch, about thirty feet up. We had to wait until after lunch for a truck to get here with a ladder tall enough. Tellya what, the boys did not like waiting around all morning looking at that thing. It was Mike, except for the chest wound. There were no broken bones

**March 10**

My encounters over the weekend and on the 4th have led to my case being escalated. I now refer to this abductor/killer as 'The Operator'. Some joke about the comms going dark or something. Giving him a name doesn't make it easier to deal with, they were all *wrapped in god damn plastic*. Like butcher meat, but it was his *organs*. I don't know what to make of a killer who does that sort of thing. I guess i don't sleep tonight, either.

**March 21**

We somehow got the town involved in the search for the 'Forest Four' as the media puts it. Fucking vultures for a good story. There was another circle-and-cross found at the cabin, expensive ones. We had one of the grossly overpaid government techies turn over the footage and screen it for clues and boy, did he find a big one. Several times in the clip, when the holder (a girl named Julie, one of the four) waves it past the trees, or over to the side, the screen jolts hard with static, because it seemed like there was no trauma happening to the camera, he could be a good nine feet! He was too far off to make out facial features

**May 19**

The McGregor house was all the way across town, that Loccy McGregor. He explained how he'd heard of the circle-and-cross symbol at the warehouse downtown and said one had appeared on his house earlier in the week and how, only yesterday, his daughter hadn't come home from work. He said it was in chalk, right on his front door. There'd been a lot of pranks like this since The Operator had grown to public notoriety. When we got to his house, i did my usual 'Operator Check' and tried to call the landline of his house. When i lifted my phone to my ear and heard only static, i knew this one was real. Loccy, this isn't a prank, that Loccy.

**June 30**

Local news did a live broadcast from the taped-off McGregor house today. I watched it more to gauge the public opinion than anything else, then she gestures to the house and turns towards it. The cameraman adjusts his shot, and theres the frame of static. I slowed it down, then. The cameraman adjusts his shot, theres the static, and then a very slight readjustment of the shot. I slowed it again, careful to pause on that frame of static and what i saw sent me cold all over. There he was, in the furthest inch of my TV set

**July 9**

I was coming home after another prank in town. Fucking teenagers tagging the circle-and-cross on doors and in the dust on cars. I decided to walk. I took up smoking again. 

**July 14**

There was one on my door, just to be sure The Operator wasn't fucking with me. Jamie answered the phone, greeting me with his usual ""Sup, boss?"". I hung up immediately. He was pretty familiar with me doing that lately.

**July 22**

Another one of the 'Forest Four' was found today. Julie wasn't in a tree, or the CB in my truck.

**August 8**

There was another circle-and-cross on my door. This time, but i didn't wait for more evidence. I just drove straight back to work and decided to hunker in here for the night. Theres a kitchen and showers, and i can fashion a bed on a cot we use for stakeouts.

**August 13**

Okay, there was a large, red, circle-and-cross on the bathroom door. Loccy and Jamie were sharing a nightcap when i came in here, but i couldn't hear them when i opened the door. I think he's right outside. I think i can hear him scratching.

HOWEVER. 
On the issues of Slender

* Slender: There's /r/gaming for Slender. Take it there. It was fun when we started

* Memes: I like em

* Slender Impersonators: Can we just stick to the one? And  make it a good one? The user totheark was a great example while he lasted. But if you're just a troll

As I said, let us know or downvote it. We want to make this great. Hopefully we can redact these damn redacteds.

Well last night was a usual night

At about 1am in the morning I was woken up by what sounded like stones being ''pinged'' against my window. I was instantly freaked out; my bedroom overlooks a church that has no gravel driveway or indeed anything that could be thrown at the window. 

It went on for about three minutes, bricks were shat.

I managed to muster up the courage to peek out the curtains. As I moved across the bed I woke my partner up

As I pull back the curtains, but this darkness seemed heavy, almost like I was trying to look through deep murky water. This shadow just dissipates into the darkness, I can't compare it to anything because it is unlike anything I've ever seen.

I sat on the edge of my bed looking through the curtains for what seemed like ages. I felt guilty

I manged to settle back into a fitful sleep, my back, cradling me. I knew what I was experiencing. I knew what it was.

Morning came and fuck... I was scared. I felt afraid. My fear must have hung in the air like a bad smell because everyone seemed to be avoiding me today

My mother called me today. Says she had a fucked up dream of a tall, calculating it's next move. She laughed, says ''he was supremely terrifying, but he was dressed impeccably, in a suit that would not look out of place on a King.''

I know... I have nothing to fear, yet when I turn he isn't there. Fuck knows what will happen to me.",,False,self,t5_2s4md,False,,

Something very strange happened to me last night... Something I still can't quite understand... It was about nine fifty-five last night when it happened. It was about time for me to be getting to bed, severe headaches and extreme paranoia), so I knew he'd been following me again. As I stood in the strip between the fence of the next-door neighbor's fence and my own font door, I watched Daisy trot off into the dark. Then the weight set in... I knew he was watching me, but i couldn't tell from where. I had my back to the street for a few seconds as I tried to pin-point my observer's position, then I remembered where I saw him last time. He had stood beneath the street lamap across from my home, which was directly behind me. I turned around to see him there, just as I had last time and bit the inside of my cheek from screaming. My mother was still inside and awake, I was mildly surprised after turning this over that I didn't jump backward. Still, but I'm not entirely sure. Then it happened. My eyes were drawn to a bit of motion near the lower right of my vision. A pale

My question now is: Why? Why would he want to touch me? He had a perfect oppernunity to take me, or worse, those around me...

When I arrived, but that surprisingly I didn't care about.  He wasn't the neatest person.  I looked around, and eventually found that the bed was made, meaning he didn't make it home.  It's at this point that I heard the door slam.  Startled I looked behind me.

I already knew who HE was.  I'd even watched some of the videos.  I just didn't want to believe.

I ran.  I ran harder then I ever had in my entire life.  I knew what had happened to him

That night I didn't sleep.  Every little noise was HIM.  Every passing light was HIM.  I cried and prayed that I'd make the night without being taken.  I did.  The sun rose

It was when I went back to my room that I saw it.  Sitting dead in the middle of my floor.  A single white piece of paper.  With HIS symbol on it.

I haven't heard from Ryan.  I don't expect to.  I know he's gone.  And all I can do is wait.

Once. 

 Bored, they're's a guy in a suit following me, wut do i do?” bullshit, you kept coming back here and to places like it. Because of what Slendy was. Unstoppable. Faceless. Mysterious. Made-Up. 


Even though Slendy would make my pulse race like no other, scaring the shit out of them with Marble Hornets and all the old creepypasta one night; apart from a few of the more gullible ones, it was just a story for them too. And I suppose because of that it's my fault for what happened to them. I'm not going to keep you in suspense here, they're dead. Or at the very least, taken. Which probably amounts to the same thing.

Stop. You're probably thinking to yourself, I knew there was a reason I still came here!” and you're probably glad that this isn't just another picture of a circle with a fucking x through it showing up in another meaningless nowhere. Stop. This is not a goddamned ghost story. And now, you're probably annoyed with me for trying to scare you with that old trick. I want to remind you that I was like you. Once. That Slendy was just a story for me. Now take a moment and ask yourself, What would you think if you actually found yourself being attacked by a creature, who, before that point, you believed to be a work of fiction? How would you ever tell someone without it being labeled another ghost story? 

Back in high school, one night, towards graduation, a mutual friend finally convinces these two to spend the night in there, provided he kept them safe. If you're wondering how he managed to swing that deal, I have been assured by credible members of the fairer sex that the gentleman in question was “Really fucking hot.” I also found out later that the pair had been frightened by recent sightings of a strange man, and were genuinely counting on this gentleman to make them feel safer. This mutual friend of theirs, and chose to share these plans with me, and a massive asshole. 

You can see where this is going. 

After using some liquid latex applied across my face to deaden my features and give me a ghostly pale complexion, moonless Colorado night. I parked a short walk away to hide my approach, and made my way to their campsite. As I approached the tent, they were still up, laughing and sharing some stolen booze to lighten the mood. From the sound of things, the mood had needed quite a bit of lightening. It wasn't long before one of them exited the tent to relieve herself in some bushes. Moving quietly, I got myself between her and the tent before turning my back to her to watch the tent and wait. It was so dark out, I quickly turned around, she was my friend

Lights from a far away house flickered as he moved through the trees. The objective was simple; getting out of there as quickly as possible. There were rumours and myths that flew around with forests like these. Big

He didn't often believe rumours but he had felt he had to find out. For hours he had walked, and between caves of bark. The hours stretched on and his calmness dwindled. The myths had begun to creep inside his mind, and everywhere he looked he thought of seeing a strange silhouette staring at him. 

He kept walking for 10 minutes, and saw a figure at the window, standing perfectly still. The torch flickered and a chill flowed through his veins as he saw that the figure had disappeared. Unsure of where to go, or how to get out of the forest completely, he turned around. 

A sharp pain hit his lungs as he swung around, catching his ankles in roots. He kept this way up for 20 minutes crawling and creeping when suddenly he hit something hard and there was nothing. 

Barely minutes passed, lying inches from his outstretched hand. He picked it up and clicked it on. Straight in front of him was a tall, thin man dressed in a pinstripe suit. Where his face should have been there was nothing except pale, white skin. His arms hung loosely by the side of his body. 

And then the torch went out.

My jaw literally dropped in shock and fear.  My legs froze and my heart pounded faster than I'd ever felt it pound before.  My brain was screaming at me to get the fuck out of there as fast as my leg muscles would allow.  I wasn't just scared

Walking by yourself 

as the world starts to grow thin

Forced to play a game 

that you know you'll never win

You know this isn't right

You can feel it in your bones

You haven't recently felt

Like you are truly alone

It won't get out of mind

You can't leave it's sight

It's watching you by day

And hunting you by night

Keep your sanity with you

It is now your only hope

In getting out alive

And getting safely home

The stars up above 

can no longer be seen

As the mist takes you in

You hold back your scream

You know he's getting closer

As your flashlight slowly dies

Darkness all around you 

Now you're clinging to your life

What is this thing that hunts you

This thing that drains your life

When will you wake up

From this terror in the night?

All you want is to go back home

But how did you lose your way?

This road you've tread 

many times before

Has now lead you to disarray 

You feel your life receding now 

On the verge of giving up 

When a kind voice behind you whispers

 ""There's no need to run""

You turn using your last strength

And don't believe your eyes

A sharply dressed man with no face

As you receive a sweet surprise

His arms extend towards you

And pick you up off the ground

Your energy coming back now

And you feel safe and sound

The sun begins to show

And the daylight hits this man

He comes up to your side

And takes you by the hand

He leads you through the woods

To the place you hold so dear

You see your house up on the hill

And away goes all your fear

You run to it quickly

Away from your new friend 

And as you approach your home

You know you are at a safe end

You turn to wave goodbye

But it seems you are too late

The man seems to have left

With no small amount of haste

You remember the night's terror 

You remember what he said

And so you enter your house

And feel a sudden dread

Everything in disorder

Everything out of place

The thing that makes Slenderman look like him is a suit and a mask, height and disproportional (to the torso) limbs. So make some [DIY stilts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjcF9jKarc4) and make some fake hands/arms and make your costume look good.

I am in a cave now. It is cool, hardening and gluing my fingers together. That must be the metallic scent in the air which corrupts the earthy musk of the cave. I settle my mind in to wait for him, I live to serve. I serve to live.

I am in the woods now. Leaves are crunching under my feet as I make my way along an unseen path. I wonder what I am doing. I can’t seem to control my body. In fact, dead oak tree. I draw the rope off my shoulder and start tying a knot in it. I loop and coil and realize it is becoming a noose. I toss it over a branch some fifteen feet above me and tie off the end around the trunk. I can’t possible reach it and that branch is the lowest so I can’t climb to it. Again I wonder what I am doing, what does He want me to do? I pull a folded piece of paper from my pocket and open it. It says that someone kidnapped children and killed people. They cannot bear to live with the guilt any longer. Whose letter is this and how did I get it? This writing is familiar, did I write this letter? I pull a pin out of my pocket and stick it through the letter and then into my chest. Wait, I feel Him. He is here. I turn around as he approaches. Everything about him is… Wrong. He is too tall to be human and his edges seem to fade. There is only a blank patch of skin where his face should be. His long, thin fingers wrap around my body and effortlessly lift me into the noose. A branch of darkness from his back come around and tightens the knot. 

And then I drop.
