I arrived on a really gloomy Michigan day, the beautiful stories the buildings tell, the intriguing people you meet, the establishments that have just popped up in midtown to the restaurants that have been on Michigan Ave for decades. I did not even know what to do with all of it. 

No one had told me about these things

Detroit is thriving in a way people don't understand. But I am absolutely thankful that I had the chance to experience it first hand. 

Detroit did not meet my expectations

Detroit is everything I wasn't expecting. It taught me about myself and about others. It showed me that simple ideas can be manifested into endeavors. It taught me to never give it. It also taught me that Northerners can't make good chicken and waffles

That being said

I am writing today to discuss what I believe may be one of the largest sporting scandals in Detroit history

Throughout the past two years

It isn't that Cuppy Coffee doesn't win, you could assert that Dashing Donut is fast because of a natural ""sugar high,"" the same argument could be used for Cuppy Coffee's ""caffeine buzz"" and yet we do not see those kind of results. An investigation would be in order so that we can get the Donut into a rehabilitation program before he (she?) ruins their life. The well-being of all competitors should be looked after first.

I trust that your respective corporations will do the right thing in this instance for the athletes. In the meantime, and Miguel Cabrera while cheering loudly for Cuppy Coffee.

It's at Stoepel Park #2

I will be there with three push mowers.  

If you have an ordinary lawn mower, bring it.  Sure, the big lawn tractors do more.  But every bit helps.  

The Mower Gang organizes via Facebook.  This event is  [https://www.facebook.com/events/587557977927495/](https://www.facebook.com/events/587557977927495/).

The Mower Gang page is at [https://www.facebook.com/MowerGang](https://www.facebook.com/MowerGang).


An editorial:  Detroit is in trouble and needs help.  We can blame the current governor, city council, city residents, suburbanites, etc.  But that won't fix it.  Can we work together to fix one small part of it?  Detroit's parks really are a gem.  

My dream is that the Detroit Mower Gang gets so big that they have to multiple meeting points, especially for those city boys who were born and raised there.

1373133639.0,1hrayg,Want to volunteer with the Detroit Mower Gang? Here's an unofficial primer.,LeftDetroitThrowAway,85,13,0,"**What is the Detroit Mower Gang?**

The Detroit Mower Gang is a group of volunteers that meet every other Wednesday to clean up parks in Detroit. If you haven't noticed, many of the parks become completely overgrown. This often results in blight, trash dumping, crime, and general badness in the area. Rather than writing strongly-worded letters to City Council, the Detroit Mower Gang decided to take matters into their own hands with direct action.

**When are the Detroit Mower Gang events?**

The location is posted [on the Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MowerGang) a few days before the event. People tend to arrive between 5-6PM, and location. There's usually between 10-20 people at each event.

**Do I need a mower?**

No, grass clipping removal, playscape cleanup, etc. If you *do* have a mower, it always helps to bring it. Riding mowers are the staple of what we do, but push mowers excel in hitting the smaller areas that the riding mowers can't reach. There's always a need for raw grunt work. The goal is to get the park into a usable condition by the time it gets dark, and this often involves a lot more than just cutting grass.

**What do I need to bring?**

Any tools of flora destruction: trash bags, leaf blowers, branch cutters, weed and grass killer, etc. Basically, anything that can be used to help tame an overgrown park. If you don't have any of those, there's usually extra tools laying around that can be utilized. As mentioned above

**What do other people bring?**

- Riding lawnmowers.
- Push mowers.
- Trash grabbers and trash bags. Empty 40s and liquor bottles don't mix well with a mower blade
- Gloves. You *really* want to bring work gloves. The trash can get exceptionally nasty. I was not aware that an empty chip bag could be used as a portable urinal until I started doing this. Seriously
- Eye protection. Crap gets thrown everywhere. I wear [a set of these](http://www.amazon.com/20-Eyedefend-Allergy-Glasses-Earthtone/dp/B007RM28PO) to keep everything out of my eyes.
- Ear protection. It can get loud when you've got 10-15 riding mowers running at the same time. I prefer [electronic ear protection](http://www.amazon.com/Howard-Leight-R-01526-Electronic-Earmuff/dp/B001T7QJ9O/) so I can block out the noise while still being able to hold a conversation.
- Water. It gets hot out. We don't need people passing out.
- Branch cutters. A lot of overgrowth gets tangled in fences and just about everything else.
- Leaf blowers. This is more for grass than leaves. The grass is often 3+ feet tall. This results in *a lot* of grass clippings
- String trimmers. These are useful for cleaning up around the edges.
- Eye drops and allergy pills. There's a crazy amount of grass and pollen in the air once we get moving. I forgot these last time, a few drops and a Benadryl can take care of the ""I have grass and pollen allergies"" excuse :). 
- Closed-toe shoes. Boots are better, or anything that exposes your toes. Actually, just don't wear Crocs. Ever.

**Where can I get Detroit Mower Gang swag?**

Talk to Tom Nardone, hoodies, etc based on the number of times you've volunteered. After enough times, you can eventually earn [a fighter jet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_v._Pepsico,_Inc.).

Hope this helps! There's a few other volunteers on here that can help answer any questions.",,t5_2qkko,1373146561.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/1hrayg/want_to_volunteer_with_the_detroit_mower_gang/

I stayed in the awesome [Hostel Detroit](http://www.hosteldetroit.com/) and they were so nice and friendly. 
They seemed to be doing brisk business, oklahoma city, a car full of kids from NYC, and someone who I think was from norway or some other scandinavian country.  

Eastern Market is spectacular

Roads are so wide and flat. Woodward is 10 lanes in some places and not even a highway. That totally just blew my mind. Some of the empty 6 lane grand boulevards in the city were eerie

Mexicantown is so enormous. It's amazing

I had a nice long talk with the bartender at LJ's Lounge in Corktown (next to slow's) That place was really cool. I stopped in at PJ's Lager house as well. The Old Miami was ok too. I think I liked the 3rd street saloon the best. Good crowd and good music. 

The Heidelberg Project was fascinating


One of the things that some of my relatives in the D talked about was the excitement about a flint GM plant being re-opened. It's interesting because that would be like if a steel mill re-opened in Pittsburgh


I had awesome food at Mudgie's, and I think a decent amount of the food was farmed in Detroit itself. Everyone seemed to be really up on the city, with lots of Detroit pride. 


Palmer Woods, nothing in Pittsburgh really compares. Albert Kahn's architecture is amazing and everywhere.  In fact so much of the architecture in the City of Detroit is just awe-inspiringly beautiful. That fresco inside of the guardian building? Holy shit! It really moved me on an emotional level.


I drove through Grosse Pointe too and saw a peacock there. The no parking signs and the private park made me :( though


All in all

Volunteers welcome!,LeftDetroitThrowAway,77,18,19,"Here's a link [to the event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/471500222912656/). Don't worry

Copypasta:

&gt; Tell Your Friends. It's a 24 hour mowing/barbecuing/camping event. The Mower Gang is hosting a Mow-A-Thon unlike any you have ever seen. For 24 hours straight we'll mow as much parkland as we can. 

&gt; We will be all over town

&gt; More details will follow

&gt; Rain Date: June 1st. 

&gt; What It Is: The event will last for 24 hours. During that time

&gt; Who: The Detroit Mower Gang is a group of volunteers that clean and mow the abandoned playgrounds of Detroit. Everyone is welcome in the gang. You don't even need equipment. If you want to join

&gt; Who Is Making This Possible: Volunteers like yourself make this possible and Husqvarna is helping us do great work by donating really great equipment. 

&gt; Why: Because kids need a place to play and they can't cut their own grass.

&gt; When: Typically

&gt; How: We will mow as much as possible in any way possible. Members bring their own lawn tractors, blowers, and work gloves. 

&gt; How Is It Judged: Some people will be there for fun. Others will be there to compete. The competition will make use of most mower's hour meters. The team that keeps their mower running for the most hours out of 24 will win the grand prize (whatever it happens to be)

&gt; How Much Does It Cost: There is no entry fee or anything like that. You'll need to bring your own gasoline, etc. 

&gt; Schedule: 9-10AM - Arrive and check in (O'Shea Playground).
&gt; 10AM - Start Mowing! until O'Shea is done.
&gt; Then on to the next park

&gt; 2PM - Lunch - A restaurant is inviting us to dine-in. They have sinks and bathrooms. 

&gt; 7PM - Dinner at Dorais Playground (our home park where we will have porta johns and we will be spending the night. 

&gt; 11PM - Midnight Snack / Mowers go quiet

&gt; 6AM - Mowers start again
&gt; 7AM - Breakfast
&gt; 10AM - Finish

&gt; Is it fun: Yup.

&gt; Is it hard work: Yes.

&gt; Is it dangerous: Eh.. 

&gt; Is it the kind of work you will be proud of: Yes.

&gt; Why do you do it: Because it feels good to help people and because when you do good things

&gt; Prizes: If anyone is interested in sponsoring the event and/or donating prizes
&gt; We could use your help. 

&gt; Where can I buy Husqvarna Equipment: You can buy Husqvarna equipment at Lowe's and at Husqvarna dealers. Billings Lawn Equipment on Main Street in Royal Oak is one.",,t5_2qkko,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/1ewksd/want_to_help_make_detroit_a_better_place_the/

It's saddening and I started feeling bad for the city. Not because its a shitty place

I didn't get to interact with too many people since I was there only for about 5 hours. I stopped at the bathtub bar downtown for a buffalo burger and it was delicious! I talked to the border crossing guy and he told me to drive down woodbine and get out of downtown to see some nice restaurants.. sort of funny that he told me to get out of Detroit for that. 

My Gf and I wanted to see some of the neighborhoods around Detroit. This was the hardest to take in! These fantastic houses that we both would love to move into and make a home. That are now decrepit and falling apart

I hope that Detroit finds a way to get out of this. I want to revisit Detroit in a few years and see some change.. I have no idea what sort of change I expect

TL;DR: Went to Detroit for a day, an sad for the people with no jobs and not a viable way out of this yet. HOPEFUL that Detroit will recover fully and pick its self up.

After much time, I’ve finally managed to close the chapter in my life known as my house in East English Village. When I bought the house 10 years ago, a much younger and more ambitious version of myself wanted to see Detroit turn around. I’d moved downtown when I was 19, settled into a roach-infested apartment, and had a great time living there. I remember saying that the only way it was going to get better was if people that cared started moving back. About 5 years after that, I found East English Village and ended up purchasing a home there.

At the time, trash was taken out, and anything broken was fixed. It was, for quite some time, one of the nicer neighborhoods in Detroit. Additionally, the neighborhood had a large number of police officers living there which made crime somewhat minimal. People were genuinely surprised when they saw the neighborhood and realized they were still in Detroit.

The housing crash took a severe toll. The majority of the houses lost something like 70-90% of their value

Over the last few years, smoke it, or steal it, then you might as well try to break it. Ghetto culture took what was once a nice neighborhood and wrecked it in less than 5 years.

As far as the actual city, and sitting on hold for another two hours, only to be told that it’s “my problem” that they can’t give me a time that they’ll be there before hanging up. It’s the same for literally any other service that the city of Detroit touches. Horrible customer service, insane waiting times, zero workmanship, and a complete lack of pride seem to be integrated into every single city “service”. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s no point in maintaining something if your neighbors are going to destroy it. Each infested home takes out the surrounding homes with it. They eventually fall like dominoes until there’s nothing left to ruin. There was nothing more disgusting than walking into the back yard and seeing condom-filled beer bottles that my “neighbor” dumped into my yard for no apparent reason. Who knows? Maybe they were cleaning out their two busted cars and missed the trash can by 30 feet.

My last straw was spending $1000 to repair the damage from a total of $6 of copper plumbing that was stolen. Enough is enough. I sold the house for pennies of what I paid for it. I have no doubt that the next inhabitants will say they “stay there” instead of “live there” and act accordingly. I’ll drive by next year and see all of my hard work destroyed in a pile of garbage. The back yard where I had my graduation party will be a trash dump used by people that have zero pride in anything they do. The front yard that I always maintained will be an overgrown weed garden. I’ve watched it happen to home after home.

There’s still good people left in Detroit. I have met and know quite a few of them. However

Best of luck Detroit. I hope you can save yourself.

To celebrate amassing 600+ subscribers- Phillip Laurie

*Philip Lauri, a lecture that focused on being decision makers, he made the decision to travel the globe for seven months.  Upon return, Chicago and Portland attempted to be Lauri’s home while he honed his professional craft in creative marketing with a few Fortune 500 companies.  But Detroit kept calling. Established in 2009, Detroit Lives! is a social brand and creative factory that is pushing to re-define the way that others perceive Detroit.  The brand uniquely manifests itself through a clothing line, filmmaking, public art and a blog.*

1346643891.0,z9hcc,I'm noticing that not too many people know much about Detroit.,melody_hero,52,22,116,"**I apologize in advance for the mural of text. I'm just hoping to spark discussion- so please feel free to downvote this into oblivion for no reason. If you do read this though

I realize some of you Redditors live in the ""city"" (Metro areas, we're all people abusing welfare, stealing scrap from anything in sight, and carjacking people at gas-stations. *Even the ones who don't do any of that and are just trying to get out of the city.* To the ones that have spent long periods of time inner city, I assume you've seen the same problems.

All of these programs going in to help the city? They aren't actually here. This technology boom? Doesn't really have anything to do with Detroit proper. Things looking bright for downtown? It's going to get ruined anyway because you're ignoring the rest of the city. It doesn't matter if making it pretty for visitors will bring in revenue- the people stuck living in the city *will* destroy it because most of us are trapped here since everyone collectively assumes we're all incapable of doing honest work so instead of hiring some of us you hire someone else from somewhere else just because they're not from Detroit even though they're both equally competent.

Too many organizations are using Detroit as a media focal point to generate buzz for themselves instead of actually helping. Why not just say ""Detroit Suburbs"" (Metro Detroit includes the city proper. City proper isn't getting any help besides downtown which is going to go to shit because the people outside of downtown but still within city limits still don't get any attention so it needs to be excluded). Why don't we just change the name of the actual city to ""That Place From Robocop?""

""We should get the youth involved so the city gets better."" Great idea, and it's not the child ""youth"" you need to look at. In fact, it's not the youth at all. You need to be looking at people aged 16 to 45- especially those at 26 and older. A 10 year old wont remember anything you tell them. You know what would really make the city better? Stop giving people looking for employment in the city but not actually living in it preference over people who actually live in the city and looking to work in the city. I'm looking directly at you, Quicken Loans and GM. I'd claim discrimination, but of course I can't afford it since I live in the city and no lawyer would bother taking on a large company just for the sake of a Detroit resident based on the idea that he might have been discriminated against for employment.

It's not like we could have people do all of the jobs nobody else wants to- like cleaning up the city roads, get better meals, and more options than a person looking to improve their situation. A cousin of mine is currently in a federal prison. Why, you ask? Because he (and I shit you not- HE SERIOUSLY SAID THIS) ""has a better life in prison than he ever did on the outside.""

Even the state hates us. Apparently the Michigan Lottery donates millions of dollars to to public schools all over the state. Quite funny how Detroit is one of the biggest (if not *the* biggest) city in the state, and if they show signs of actually caring and holding a student back due to incompetence they'll lose their job. Don't even get me started on college students. Apparently the work I did while away at college had taxes taken out of it for being a Detroit resident... *while working 700+ miles away from Detroit.* All of my desperately needed college money taken by my city and they wont even do anything for me. I'm probably not going to be able to get a refund on that money, either. I'm surprised they didn't put their name on my degree in massive red font covering my name.

Maybe the National Guard should do the rest of the nation a favor and bomb us off of the face of the map since you all hate us so much. That way people like me who are nothing like the stereotypical ""Detroit resident"" no longer have to suffer the same fate as our moronic brethren. Or better yet, uncanny athletic abilities, unrivaled imagination, or a mind for innovation could be stuck in a hole like non-downtown Detroit *just because their parents got shafted long before that child was even conceived.* I can't even mention how many people I've seen that could have actually done something good for the world slain, jailed, or otherwise victimized by the system because they couldn't get to the resources they needed to actually be something.

This might seem like I'm just ranting- because I am. I'm noticing my once-decent neighborhood be completely destroyed and because I wasn't born in a well-to-do family in a place with a good education system and good/fair employment options I'm stuck here unless I want to risk living out on the streets until I can hopefully land a job and housing somewhere far away- which would probably mean I'm going to die on the streets. Or maybe I should write a book about living ""in da hood"" and have it turned into a Madea movie, but since I'm one of the ""forsaken"" I'd probably spend more time looking for help that I would getting things done. The only programs I can join to help the city don't actually service my part of the city- which is one of the 'bad' parts. THE PARTS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE HELP. I've tried contacting city officials, too. I've been blown off and ignored. Even someone who was running for city office who originally seemed to be interested in what I had to say before primaries turned out to be just as corrupt as everyone city official. I've tried contacting companies, Oprah, city officials, the White House, neighboors... nobody really cares about us Detroiters. Not even our fellow Detroiters.

This is the first and last time I'm going to rant here because I know Reddit just wants to see regurgitated pictures of ""cute"" stuff collected from Google images (you guys aren't fooling anybody. A good majority of the stuff that makes front page has been on the net for about 5+ years), since I see where the attention is aimed at and I know it wont benefit me at all since I'm a resident of inner-city Detroit. I plan on starting up a blog about the things that REALLY happen in Detroit... not that it'll ever generate any buzz, but at least I *might* be able to show people how Detroit proper really is to at least TRY to break the stereotypes and spark action from it's residents.

**Tl;dr**- Everyone still hates inner-city residents for no logical reason- and it's part of the problem with the area as a whole... The other part being the idiots giving others a reason to hate EVERYONE in the city.

I just wanted to let any local PC gamers know that we're hosting the 9th annual [Expo Icrontic](http://icrontic.com/article/expo-icrontic-2012) in Warren from June 20th-24th; it's an extravaganza of LAN gaming, Magic: The Gathering, boardgaming tournaments, and more (duct tape challenge, movie screenings, etc.). It's a con celebrating the geek lifestyle.

The premiere event is the BYOC LAN party. Team Fortress 2 is the most popular event, and we usually play UT2K4 because it's still fun in a LAN after all these years.

We have industry reps from THQ, and Verizon attending, so expect some cool swag and availability of experts for upgrade advice, hardware discussion, or just general geeking out. 

**update:** I see that LoL is a very popular game. It's also very popular in the Icrontic community, though in random pickup games.

It started off as a community event

I currently live in Boston

After reading some of the comments in that post and doing some quick real estate research, I'm pretty confident my business would succeed.  Not only would my lease be all but non-existent compared to my prior estimates, but there also seems to be relatively little in the way of competition.  So before I start calling brokers and booking a plane ticket, can you guys get me up to speed about the city?

* What is the West Side Industrial Area and Delray (near Historic Fort Wayne) like?  I saw some great warehouse space online in those two areas.  They seem to be minutes from downtown and right off major highways.  Are these abandoned or high-crime areas?

* How active is downtown on weekends?  I've read a lot of people live outside the city.  Do people come downtown at all for activities not related to pro sports?

* I see a lot of folks and organizations promoting small business

I'm sure I'll have some more questions

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Michigan during mid-Sept. and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration
