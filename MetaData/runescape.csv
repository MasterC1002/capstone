Hey Reddit

I strongly dislike SOF and some of the latest updates and some people don't like that

I currently have no goals on RuneScape and mostly just come on to talk with friends so I got time to answer your questions. :P

I will be happy to answer your questions and please stay nice! :)

Also I am currently at World 3 Lumbridge Lodestone if someone wants to come hang with me but I will try my best to answer the questions here first.

EDIT: System update!

Going to take a break from RuneScape

Thank you so much everyone for the positive response

This sub is notorious for being unsupportive and petty. We can change this.

We all started this game at about the same age. We played this game instead of doing our math homework or meeting girls. Some of us later met girls

My point is

Stop being dicks to one another.

...are kinda wrong!

I met my boyfriend on Runescape via Skype chat with mutual RS friends.  We've been dating for a year now. We met in person in October of last year. I spent my winter break at his house

The hassle of buying plane tickets, and not being able to see him everyday are pretty crappy things to deal with. I know long distance relationships aren't everyone's cup of tea, but being in one with him is honestly so worth it. He's a huge part of my life; we talk from sun up to sun down. The time I get to spend with him is better than anything I could ever ask for. He's my best friend and I met him on Runescape. Fucking Runescape.

Greetings /r/Runescape

Stunts 1337 started a thread in the official Runescape '07 forums that has rallied 40 pages (and counting) of support. When the servers go live, buy some stew in Seer's Village, and then do the Waterfall quest for the quickest possible combat levels.

In the words of our glorious leader

&gt;Here is a pro tip: The waterfall quest has no requirements, this quest give you free level 30 attack and strength from level 3.

The event will occur **Friday night**

This event is only the beginning. I have already collected several enthusiastic theorycrafters, share, and utilize all knowledge of Runescape 2007. Any knowledge gained will be openly shared with the public, ultimately in a wiki format. We are not simply passive arbiters of knowledge, however; we will be taking an active role in the evolution of '07scape's economy through profitable events like the one tomorrow. If you have a craving for knowledge, want to help the economy grow, or if you just want to become stinking rich and powerful

**The full plan for Friday

* Join world 27 AKA 327
* Join friend chat ""Stunts 1337""
* Get at least 6 air runes from the tutorial mage by dropping them and talking to him again
* ~~Do the Cook's Assistant quest in Lumby castle for food needed in the Stronghold and general travel damage~~ Nevermind
* Run to the Stronghold of Security and finish the first two levels for 5k gp
* Home teleport or exit the stronghold via rope escape
* Run to Draynor and buy 2 ropes from Ned
* Bank your extra gp in case you die. Keep at least 1504gp for provisions.
* Buy 6 earth and 6 water runes (17gp each
* Take the Port Sarim charter boat (1
* Buy 5-15 stew (20gp each) from the bartender in Seer's Village
* Run to the waterfall for the Waterfall Quest
* After the Waterfall quest

**Notes**:

* We are only doing the first two levels of the stronghold because we are likely to die on the third level. 5k is plenty enough to see us through this raid. **Amendment:** You may actually do the third level if you choose
* You will probably want to switch servers and/or go to other shops than Port Sarim's while purchasing runes
* The quest requires 6 air runes, and 2 ropes to complete. If anyone knows the requirements to be different in '07scape, then please speak up.
* There are lvl 84 giants in the dungeon who hit for 8-9 HP on average

**Quest Strategies**

* We will probably want to enter the tomb in teams of about 10 people so that mobs have difficulty killing us while we run past. 
* We can have rangers distracting the fire giants to eliminate the danger of being 1-shotted. Private message me in Reddit if you want to be a ranger. ~thanks **troaccid**
* We can have fletchers collecting arrows for the rangers so that they have unlimited supply. Contact me if you want to be a fletcher. 

Specific strategies will probably become clearer through trial and error

We are open to any suggestions or alterations to the plan. The plan as it stands is the work of several volunteers from the original thread

**Resources and links**:

* [Waybackmachine'd Tip.it

**All problems are solved for now

* ~~What is the max hit of the highest-hitting mob in the dungeon

* ~~Are there quick ways to level HP? Perhaps a quest that rewards HP or a lamp? We may need to level our HP first if the highest-hit in the dungeon is over 10.~~ **Solved. We should be ok without leveling HP


* ~~What is the most efficient way for fletchers to collect and transport arrows? Should they be crafted or bought; if crafted, but once we start there should be a steady supply.~~ **Solved**

* ~~How many fire giants must we contend with

* * [safespot_a](http://i.imgur.com/Q5LRAe8.jpg) 

* * [safespot_b](http://i.imgur.com/rfbTddH.jpg) ~thanks Benjolia!

Theorycrafters who solve these problems will be added to my friend's list and may be chosen as officers of the clan. I cannot yet offer a station until it has become clear how many theorycrafters are joining the guild

**The Theorycrafters** - thank you for all your help!

Reading the comments I recognize that I failed to really elaborate on the ""fun"" factor sufficiently when that was a major point I wanted to hit when I originally laid out this post in my head. My main lesson learned here is to actually edit and revise big stuff you intend to write. For a lot of good points and my replies

*It is important to note that this is an overly simplistic analysis meant to simply illustrate a basic point*

**Intro**
---

One of the most common questions in this subreddit (and for people who play Runescape in general) is how to level up a skill. When asking for advice, profit. On the surface, minimizing cost or making some money while gaining XP in a skill might seem attractive, more often than not that ""profit"" is just a big lie.

This writeup is not meant to explicitly describe the best method for a player

**The Scarcest Resource**
---

Resources are basically anything that you might consume to further your goals. For a lot of skills, and torstols. Most of these resources are continually renewed in the game through player skilling or monster drops. With the advent of the Grand Exchange, these resources can all be equated to money since you can simply buy what you need. When you run out of money, you can go earn some more.

However, or buy it. This resource is **time**. To put it a little morbidly, every person who plays Runescape will eventually succumb to their mortality. Even if you subscribe to a particular faith that has some concept of the afterlife, I doubt you'd somehow get to import your RS character over there. That said, time is your most valuable resource - once it has passed it can never be regained.

However

**An Example: First Look**
---

*I'm pulling numbers from the RSWiki for the most part so there may be some inaccuracies*

pr0n00b wants to level up Crafting from level 70 to 90

**Method A: Spinning Flax at Lumbridge**

*XP/hr*: 20k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: +157k/hr

**Method B: Crafting Green Dragonhide Bodies**

*XP/hr*: 186k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: -6m/hr

From a raw monetary perspective

However

**Opportunity Cost**
---

This concept from economics is the idea that whenever you have to choose between mutually exclusive things

In the context of Runescape, the greatest value activity is your best way of making money. When you do just about any other activity, you measure the cost in terms of how much you're *not* making use of your best source of income.**

**Re-visiting the Example**
---

**Method A: Spinning Flax at Lumbridge**

*XP/hr*: 20k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: +157k/hr

*GP Change*: +36.1M

*Time Required*: 230 hours

**Method B: Crafting Green Dragonhide Bodies**

*XP/hr*: 186k xp/hr

*GP/hr*: -6m/hr

*GP Change*: -148.4M

*Time Required*: 24.7 hours

Now that we have a more complete picture of how these methods work out, and method B costs an additional **184.9M GP**. The way you should be looking at these two methods is if someone were to attempt method B, they would finish the same XP goal sooner, albeit poorer. So what can they do with all this extra time? **Make money**

With a difference of 184.9M GP and 205.3 hours to work with, farming is about the only solid option, reaching about 2-3M GP/hr for actual time invested.

Now the real beauty of method B is that you don't necessarily have to spend all that time doing the same thing. If you have access to a better source of income such as QBD (1.5m/hr) or kilning (3-4m/hr)

**A Quick Tangent**
---

The reason why people might find method A more attractive is a psychological phenomenon known as **Loss Aversion**, 600 people would die. They were given two separate sets of options and their hypothetical estimated success rates to choose from.

**Set 1**

*Option A* - 200 people are expected to live

*Option B* - 1/3 chance of saving 600 people

**Set 2**

*Option C* - 400 people are expected to die

*Option D* - 1/3 chance that no one dies

The majority of participants preferred options A and D. The catch? Options A and C and options B and D are mathematically identical. The difference is how things were worded.

It is studies like these that help to illustrate our seemingly irrational decision making process and why it may have been tempting to pick slower

**The ""Fun"" Factor**
---

I can't ever argue for or against the ""funness"" of an activity. From a subjective point

If you intend on hitting your goal using the slower method, you have extra time on your hands. You can use this free time to do anything you like, make more money, play Castle Wars, or go do non-RS related things. In the above examples of QBD or Kiln level income, that's **80-150 hours** for you to do as you please. All while still having the same amount of gold and same XP goal met. 

**Final Thoughts**
---

For a long time there has been a major schism between players who cared about more efficient means of playing the game and those who did not care about this efficiency at all. Once more, it is my intention to foster an understanding of why efficiency minded players make the arguments they do and further close the aforementioned gap between players. I don't care what path people actually choose so long as they fully understand their options.

Whether you are playing on the Old School Servers or RuneScape Servers

We have lost over 1

As a consequence the ban hammer will be thrown around if people carry on acting like this

**This is not a circle jerk community.**

This is not to say that discussion about RS vs. 07 is not allowed. Just circle jerking and general childish behavior will not longer be tolerated.


If what you are saying is just telling someone one else that one server is better than the other this is not needed and adds nothing to the community.

These are not rules
 
* **Clue Scrolls** - It sucks that you only got 500gp from a 30 minute clue scroll but it isn't rare

* **Advice** - Bossing - Sidebar, if after looking here you still need advice sure post because then it could be an interesting conversation starter.

* **Phishing Sites** - For the love of all that is RuneScape if you find a phishing site **DO NOT** post it. Report it on the Runescape [Website](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Phishing).

* **RS Memes** - Unless it's original content it's a repost. If you must repost credit the author.

* **Picture Quality** - Taking a picture with your phone and uploading it to imgur is retarded. Alt + Print Screen ( Shift + CMD + 3 on Mac) is how to print screen learn it

**EDIT:** [This](http://i.imgur.com/Ft8kc.png) may be helpful. Thanks to /u/AlmostNPC. 

**EDIT 2:** (CMD + Shift + 4) is like the snipping tool for Mac thanks to /u/Chop_Hard

* **Flipping** - 5M Flip? Congratulations but in all [honesty](http://i.imgur.com/Wyva4Jd.gif).

* **Drops** - Just got a cool drop at GWD? Has it been posted 50 times this week already? We don't need to see that.

* **Some-one else got this achievement!** - Seriously stop Karma Whoring. 

All of these are from the current 25 in new when i wrote this. As I said earlier these aren't rules by any means just some helpful tips to help you when submitting here.

1.) Doesn't work with RES

2.) Doesn't work with Hover Zoom (What I use)

3.) It takes longer to load than an average direct link or Imgur page.

However, simply right click the image, and click ""Copy Image URL."" With that link copied, submit it to reddit, and you have a much friendlier link.

While looking for a good boxing match, i thought Staker would summon a titan of some sort during the fight , so i ran to get a steel and some scrolls. 

I returned to challenge him and said ""lets do this! titan fight !"" guess i gave it away and he declined my challenge.
While this was going on i told my friend (phill) what the guy was trying to do

The fight starts off and the staker summons, now when i saw this i realized right away what he was going to do, he had a full inventory of rocktails to use swallow whole scroll to heal during the boxing fight. 

Phill (who is maxed) summoned a Steel titan and started wrecking him faster than he could cast swallow whole scroll and soon died raging that he failed trying to dual arena scam some one. 

Anyways

&gt;**I'm not in the player support or ICU teams so I'm not really part of issuing or removing bans

&gt;**Take it easy

&gt;**Sabre**

**Huge Props to the jagex team for reviewing my case. I would recommend people to not use hotspotshield vpn while scaping as alot of goldfarmers apparently uses it too.**


EDIT: 43 days not 90. It is late at night here and i miscalculated how many days passed.

My rsn is kingkorea and I was banned on March 15th
http://imgur.com/D0I2BgI
I am(was) an owner of a max cape and my runescaping habits before getting this ban was:

1. Daily pops
2. Weekly Strange Rocks
3. Misc. comp cape requirements
4. Daily dg challenges

In the previous 1 month or so before this ban

1. Increased the net worth of my bank (goldfarming)
2. I have not traded a single player in that time period. All my rs transactions went through the GE.

I play rs sometimes with a free vpn which i believe means that other people using the same vpn might have the same ip. I tried logging into my secondary account (which i have only used for squeal spins but similarly have not traded a single player) xspelluserx but it was also automatically banned after logging in.

My problem is that, either accepting or declining it. After playing this game for 10 years, i would have expected a common courtesy of not making me wait ~~90~~ 43 days for my appeal.

The purpose of this topic was not to ""beg"" jagex to unban my account(s) or to invoke pity among the people. I want jagex to look into my account and the evidence against my account and determine the correct action. Having to wake up everyday with no response is absolutely frustrating.

Thank you and have a good day.

edit: The vpn i use is called hotspotshield which is a vpn service that has a trial. The lovely people at thepiratebay uploaded a crack of the software where i can use the trial version indefinitely. I believe all the other people who use the same vpn with the same fix might be all associated with the same ip but i do not fully understand vpns so this is just my guess.",self,t5_2qwxl,1367045082.0,,other-skill,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1d5to5/dear_jagex_mods_i_believe_i_was_wrongly_perm/

I could be wrong

**Exhibit A:** [The lottery scam post in question.](http://i.imgur.com/H6Lagh.png)

Seems innocent enough.

**Exhibit B: Background Check**

Exhibit B1: [Background check #1](http://i.imgur.com/6Jnyph.png)

Exhibit B1 shows the first post he made (he only made 4-5 posts, he is claiming that he is financially stable enough to giveaway a santa hat, AND a party hat in the future once he gets 1700 (1700 of what? who knows). 

He tried to hide his tracks for this piece of evidence

Exhibit B2: [He doesn't even have starting cash](http://i.imgur.com/2TULIh.png)

Commented on that same post asking if people could give him even a portion of a phat. He also claims he doesn't even have starting cash.

Exhibit B3: [He deleted part 2 of his Runescape story](http://i.imgur.com/48R9y.png)

He removed the second part of his Runescape story (which is possibly the story of how financially unstable he is

Again


**Exhibit C:** [The problems with his post.](http://i.imgur.com/gNYOqh.png)

There are a lot of problems with his post. I point to each of them in the image of exhibit C. The two main problems (I point out 4 in the exhibit image) are:

* If he's planning to giveaway a santa

* Where's the proof of the santa hat and the party hat? No proof given. 

**Conclusion**

This evidence leads me to believe that Gaping is running a lottery scam. He gives people ""free entry""
