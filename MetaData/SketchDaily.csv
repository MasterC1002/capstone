Alternate Theme - Manatees

Mermaids, have existed in seafaring cultures at least since the time of the ancient Greeks. Typically depicted as having a woman's head and torso, a fishtail instead of legs and holding a mirror and comb, mermaids live in the ocean and, according to some legends, can take on a human shape and marry mortal men. Mermaids are closely linked to sirens, another folkloric figure, part-bird

Mermaid sightings by sailors, dugongs or Steller's sea cows (which became extinct by the 1760s due to over-hunting). Manatees are slow-moving aquatic mammals with human-like eyes, bulbous faces and paddle-like tails. It is likely that manatees evolved from an ancestor they share with the elephant. The three species of manatee (West Indian, West African and Amazonian) and one species of dugong belong to the Sirenia order. As adults, they're typically 10 to 12 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. They're plant-eaters, have a slow metabolism and can only survive in warm water. -The History Channel",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/comments/16906r/january_9th_mermaids/

1359216976.0,17bhtl,January 26th - Serious Saturday - Balls,DocUnissis,62,5,93,"This theme by AlmightyTurtleman

""The idea is ball rendering. You render a ball in light in a scene. This seems simple but is actually very hard in practice. You can add 2 different lights, make it rough, smooth, dim, transparent etc. It allows people of any level to have a technical challenge while providing a heavy enough restriction to breed creativity. As long as the image features a rendered ball it's legit. Media isn't important as long as it's not vector. People won't even need a reference. ""

1375737838.0,1jrmft,Survey Results,artomizer,47,5,12,"Thanks to everyone who took the time to do the survey. We've been discussing the results on irc and in modmail

[So

**What does all this mean?**

* We've changed the flair. It now shows two numbers:

1. Your current streak

2. The total number of themes you've submitted a link to (still considering changing this to the number of total posts

The color scheme for the flair has also been reworked so it's more of [a progression](http://i.imgur.com/Vlq0KYh.png) rather than randomly changing colors. Thanks to JTxt for the idea.


* Most people seemed happy with when themes are being posted now


* We're going to start either combining or alternating serious saturdays and still life sundays. This might start next month as we've already got a bunch scheduled.

* We haven't fully decided what to do with contests yet. I think the plan is to leave it in /r/artbattle for now

**Other stuff

* Donkeyitis day was a success. We're going to try moving to a randomly selected artist of the month kind of thing next month... so watch out for that!

* I've added another tag: \[\](/nostreak). Including this in your comment will cause it to be ignored by the streak counter. You're welcome to use it or ignore it... we're not going to be policing it or anything. It looks like this: [](/nostreak)

* [This](http://stats.sketchdaily.net/) exists now and is updated daily. We'll be adding more stuff to it eventually

**I also wanted to respond to a few of the comments that came in:**

&gt; Is there a way to show previews of the linked images directly in the thread?

Maybe not exactly what you're asking for

&gt; I honestly have no clue how you guys keep the place running so smoothly. I can't even recall the last time I saw a nasty comment. Great community.

It's actually pretty amazing how little we have to do. The community is so great that I don't think I've ever had to remove a comment except for the occasional spam. So thanks to all of you for being awesome.

&gt; I don't know what these things are: Flockdraw replacement &amp; reference site.

If you haven't checked it out, [and will have all sorts of other neat stuff!](https://trello.com/b/bvCVRqF6/hip-drawing-app)


**And a couple from the reference site feedback:**

A lot of the ideas that were sent in are on [the to do list](https://trello.com/b/vynO3KO3/reference-site)

&gt; Last I checked there were still no animals.

We still don't have too many

    
     

&gt; better mobile support

I'd love to hear more on this if any of you mobile people have been having issues with it. I made a little change not too long ago which should have fixed the header controls when drawing an image

&gt; It might just be my computer

We've recently added something that will keep track of errors like this. If it's giving you trouble send me a PM or message me in the chat and I'll see what I can do.

Don't forget to take a look at the [reference site help wanted page](http://reference.sketchdaily.net/help) if you've got some free time!

Here are 2 sites with tools for gesture drawing:

[Artsy Poses](http://www.artsyposes.com/models)

[Pixelovely](http://www.pixelovely.com/gesture/figuredrawing.php)

From the last time we did this:

&gt;Go there
The point is first of all to get the flow of the pose down correctly and second of all get the proportions right, keep that eraser away from you), if that's not possible for you then digital also works, but it can be harder depending on how familiar you are with it. This is serious practice stuff and it's great if you do it all on your own whenever you're bored too, gives you great understanding of anatomy and posing.

Here is [the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Vr3yQYWQ).

Here are the lyrics:

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

When she gets there she knows

With a word she can get what she came for

Ooh


There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure

'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

In a tree by the brook

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh

Ooh


There's a feeling I get when I look to the west

And my spirit is crying for leaving

In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees

And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh

Ooh


And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune

Then the piper will lead us to reason

And a new day will dawn for those who stand long

And the forests will echo with laughter


If there's a bustle in your hedgerow

It's just a spring clean for the May queen

Yes

There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder


Your head is humming and it won't go

The piper's calling you to join him

Dear lady

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?


And as we wind on down the road

Our shadows taller than our soul

There walks a lady we all know

Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold


And if you listen very hard

The tune will come to you at last

When all are one and one is all

To be a rock and not to roll


And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Unfortunately surveymonkey only lets you see the first 100 answers on free surveys

A few of the things I've gotten from the results:

* I was surprised that so many people didn't care when themes are posted. I think it's still for the best that themes are posted ASAP

* If the theme (during a theme week or otherwise) is really specific we should have an alternate theme for people to do.

* Most people are happy with Freedraw Fridays as they are now

* Lots of people are interested in doing some more serious drawing exercises. Every saturday might be a bit much

* Lots of people are interested in critiques

Thanks again to everyone who took the time to do the survey and all the great feedback! If you're one of the unlucky 5 people who were the last to fill it out and your results were lost I'm sorry! Feel free to post your comments here or message the mods.
