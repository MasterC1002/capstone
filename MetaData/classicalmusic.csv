In short

Thanks!

PS: This is going to be a dense post, and how it shows through clearly in their compositions: what kind of a childhood, youth, love life did they have? what kind of a political climate were they in? how were they in real life -- mean, genial, aloof? if they were pioneers, then which traditions did they break away from? if they were superhuman prodigies, and hear exactly how did they tower over the other everyday geniuses. i know it will be a lot of effort to write brief biographies -- but anything you have the time to write in will be appreciated! i'm hungry to know more

1325795923.0,o4ei0,"Regarding the latest ""Strad vs Modern"" study...A long rebuttal.",Luckybeargod,699,92,143,"This latest [study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/01/02/1114999109) has been all over Reddit lately

1. **There Is No Original Strad

This isn't really a criticism of the study *per se*, which changes the angle of the strings; the **Bridge** is now taller and more arched; the **Tailpiece** is completely different; the **Chinrest** wasn't invented until \~90 years later (1820); the **Bass bar** is much stronger now to cope with the added stress; **Gut strings** have almost been completely replaced by steel strings. The **Bow** has also been radically redesigned, anyone who has used a baroque bow will know that those are much more delicate than modern bows.

And those are just the general changes. Many vintage instruments have been subjected to a lot of horrors over the years; There are instances of old luthiers who, and this is much more common than you'd think. I was told by no less than Ruggiero Ricci that Jascha Heifetz' famous 1742 *ex-David* Guarneri del Gesù was actually a composite; only the back was actually by del Gesù, the top and sides were from other makers. And let's not forget human fallibility; shoddy workmanship, misguided restoration techniques, general ignorance...a lot of crap can happen in \~300 years.

All things considered, the Strad or Guarneri sound we hear today is really the result of several happy (or sad) accidents, and is almost certainly completely different from what Strad or Guarneri heard themselves. 

These facts are not really talked about; Violin dealers in particular really don't like to discuss them and can be quite shady if you try to pin them down. After all
*****
2. **Just Because It's The Same Maker Doesn't Mean The Violins Are Similar**

We're conditioned today to expect a certain level of quality from a brand; because of stringent Quality Controls

Old violins were not mass produced, his designs seemed to have varied with his mood. There's a joke that Guarneri must have gotten really drunk when he made the [Cannone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Cannone_Guarnerius) because the design is so wildly dissimilar to his other violins.

So even from the start these violins were not uniformly made. Add \~300 years of variability and it's not hard to see that the violins have become very different and unique unto themselves. There is no Stradivarius^® or Guarneri^TM .
*****
3. **There's No Reason Modern Violins Can't Be As Good As Old Ones**

This is probably the last thing dealers like to hear, better pyramid if we really wanted to with modern technology?

*""Oh, some will scoff. Oh yeah? Well I got news for you: **There's actually very little original varnish on any of these concertizing violins.** And even if it's still there, it's most certainly under layers of dirt, grime, polish, and god knows what other contaminants have come over the centuries. Violin varnish is incredibly delicate, and has to be tended to and replaced when it wears away, how come it only affected Strad and Guarneri?** What was stopping all the other makers from using it? Guarneri in particular was not a rich man

The most frustrating thing about these ""theories"" is that as already stated

There is a caveat to this; I do believe violins need a break-in period before their tone really comes out. I've heard anywhere from 5-30 years of use so it's quite variable

Many people

This is not a new or radical idea. All great players, practicing on the new ones to save stress and wear on the old. Heifetz in particular got quite annoyed with people who attributed his sound to the violin instead of him. There is a story that Heifetz brought a cheap fiddle to a rehearsal, wowed the orchestra, and smashed it in full view at the end to get the point across that *he* was in control, not the violin. Which brings me to my last and probably most controversial point:
*****
4. **Modern Violinists Aren't Really Maxing Out The Potential In Their Violins**

This will probably upset some people, a great violin will have the ability to output a range of colors and tones if the player desires and has the technique to do so. And therein lies the problem.

I'm not aware of any player in the last \~40 years where I can close my eyes and go, they all sound so damn generic. This wasn't always the case. Anyone with ears will be able to distinguish between Kreisler, Heifetz, Oistrakh, Menuhin etc...their sound signatures are so unique, there's no mistaking them. Perlman probably comes closest, but his range still pales in comparison to the electrifying variability of the older masters. **Their violins are still being played

Far too much emphasis is placed on ""purity of tone"" these days. In reality, do battle with Brahms, output all the vivid colors of Prokofiev? More importantly, can I, the player? These are the questions that should be asked, not whether Strad soaked his wood in chemicals or which violin sounds best in the 20 sec. opening of the Tchaikovsky Concerto.

To conclude

**TL;DR: Please just read the damn thing

Years ago, and I thought I was headed for the top of the world.

As I continued to study composition, deliberately distrusting my intuition and turning to algorithms and patterns. I began to idolize the serialists and the total serialists, not because I loved them, but because I believed it was the only way to be a ""smart"" composer. Harmonies had to be as complex as possible. Rhythms had to be viciously complex. Melodies (or, God forbid, ""tunes"") were out of the question.

Things got bad fast. I couldn't focus on my writing, and I began exhibiting strange psychosomatic symptoms.

Within several weeks

To make a long story short, my emotion, and my influences. But it was too late. I will never have a career in composition. I am too far behind; I lost my chance to learn well and stay ahead in the game. Years later I am still anxious about composing, and I suspect I always will be.

This happened because I felt some pressure (partially real, to restrict my composing to a specific style. In my case, it was the mid-century avant-garde that broke my spirit. But when Schoenberg was first writing, it was the tonalists. Tomorrow, it could be anybody, and the target could be you.

My point is this: **no one should ever say how anyone else's music ought to sound.** There is *no* excuse for saying what ""is"" and ""is not"" music. Many people involved in the classical world do this. The conductors do it, from caustic atonal-fascists to drooling Whitacre hacks.

Anybody who writes music should feel free to write in the style she chooses, look like, or accomplish. I almost died because of that kind of sentiment. Now I'm fighting back.

**Edit:** Everyone, and supportive responses. I'll try to respond to everyone's comments more tomorrow, so keep them coming. But I want to get a little work done on a piece before I go to bed!

[Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Shostakovich)

**Life and times**

Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich (Дмитрий Дмитриевич Шостакович, and this influenced his art very directly. In 1936, Comrade Stalin attended a performance of Shostakovich's opera *Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District*; although the opera had previously been praised by the Soviet press for its ideological correctness, Stalin quite visibly did not enjoy it. Two days later, an editorial in *Pravda* called the opera ""Muddle Instead of Music"" and suggested that things ""may end very badly"" for Shostakovich. In this first prototype of the Communist regime's new mechanism of cultural control, critics who had previously praised Shostakovich's work publicly revised their opinions; he lost most of his commissions and performance engagements, and several of his friends and family were soon imprisoned or executed.

Shostakovich's response was the Fifth Symphony, Shostakovich wrote his most personal feelings into ""desk drawer"" compositions, mainly piano solos and especially chamber music, not meant for public performance.

Of course the biggest event in restoring Shostakovich's public reputation was Stalin's death in 1953, he regained so much favor with the Khrushchev regime (fortunately, Khrushchev had no ear for muthat he  joined the Communist Party to become General Secretary of the Composer's Union; by this point, younger composers were happily studying forbidden musical concepts like serialism, and Shostakovich suddenly seemed like an icon of conformity. It's not clear what was going through Shostakovich's head, even from his own conflicting accounts, but soon he wrote the Eighth String Quartet - some previous works had been dedicated to friends and family who perished under Stalin, a musical suicide note.

Though the quartet trailed off in a signature *morendo*, he influenced a school of younger successors, including /r/classicalmusic favorite Alfred Schnittke.

**Music**

Even when Shostakovich seemed to be at his most patriotic, but historians question its authenticity.

At any rate, with some extensions or tidbits of chromaticism. With fifteen string quartets and fifteen symphonies, often with roughly traditional movement orders, he was certainly one of the most prolific composers of these backward-looking genres in the twentieth century. And backward he did look: he was fond of quoting melodies from other composers or himself, and channeled Bach in his own preludes and fugues. Even his most personal chamber music generally follows the same formal and tonal idioms as his symphonies meant for public consumption.

From Mahler, in much the same respect. He was influenced by many Russian composers, including contemporaries like Prokofiev and Stravinsky as well as the old greats like Tchaikovsky and especially Mussorgsky. Though it's not immediately apparent to the ear, he counted the Second Viennese School among his strongest inspirations.

**Some examples**

* [Two pieces for string octet
* [Two pieces for string quartet
* [*Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk*
* [Symphony #5
* [Violin concerto #1, the dedicatee, pleaded for a pause before the final movement so he could wipe the sweat from his brow
* [Prelude and fugue #1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuj5uzgmB5A) (1952) - a fugue in C major without a single accidental; Shostakovich himself at the piano
* [Symphony #10, according to the dubious memoir
* [String quartet #8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDDNS4BM1xQ) (1960), and a pastiche of his other work
* [String quartet #15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz6o9wCNxbc0) (1974) - he instructed the Beethoven Quartet to play the first movement ""so that flies drop dead in mid-air
* [*Orango*, can't find audio) - Shostakovich wrote about 40 minutes of this planned opera about a human-ape hybrid before suddenly breaking off, perhaps because of his tenuous position with Stalin; it was only rediscovered very recently

**More?**

I'm sure one could write a much longer essay about any one of these compositions, if you like - but notice the new reminder to mention the composer and title in your submission.

IVES EFFECT: The child develops a remarkable ability to carry on several separate conversations at once.

GLASS EFFECT: The child tends to repeat himself over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

STRAVINSKY EFFECT: The child is prone to savage

BRAHMS EFFECT: The child is able to speak beautifully as long as his sentences contain a multiple of three words (3, 12, etc.) However, his sentences containing 4 or 8 words are strangely uninspired.

The 9th symphony is important because it changed the symphony.  And that was cool and all, well-fed musicians, all maintained by a single man [\(who sunk his family fortune on the likes of Haydn and Beethoven... and his little brothel\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaus_II,_F%C3%BCrst_Esterh%C3%A1zy_de_Gal%C3%A1ntha).  By the time of the 9th (1824) The Symphony was still rather young, having taken baby steps with the short compositions of [Stamitz](http://youtu.be/UmhBXDeYmD0) to becoming a fully fledged form thanks to Haydn, and his 104 examples.  Haydn had only completed the his final ""London Symphony"" 8 years before Beethoven's 3rd symphony (1803). 
 
So why is the 3rd so important?

Well, European culture was obsessed with order and logic, and they expressed this in their music as well.  The ideal of musical perfection in the classical era was that which followed proper structure and form.  
So along comes Beethoven.  At first all seemed well,
in the [3rd](http://youtu.be/tHvztnHOWEQ) Beethoven gives traditional form the finger.  Firstly, there isn't a call-and-response, antecedent-consequent phrase structure. AND THEN he starts the thing off in  Eb major until the 7th measure when all of a sudden there is a C#... he is not just playing with ideas, he is playing with harmonic structure as well.
But then to top it all off

This may seem silly to us today
Beethoven took a huge leap forward with this one piece of music.  So

BTW[ here](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113180375618328351247/posts/GfHSg1h9rZU) is a little thing I wrote a while back about the 9th.

One professor bought a grand piano, a grand piano AND a harpsichord for 1 Cent. 1 fucking cent. 

I'm not sure why I'm saying this, but there were just no way we could transport it (which was required).

It is only three days in, etc etc. He can do this with almost anything in the field of music. I can not stress how brilliant this man is.


But today was even more special.


One of our theory professors teaches a course on serialism every other year in the spring. Given that Dr. Westergaard was really beginning to be active and become known in the 50’s and 60’s, if you are interested). He then started recalling his time in Germany and France on a Fulbright in the years leading up to that. He got to study composition with Milhaud, analysis with Messiaen, and would frequently travel to Darmstadt and interact with the likes of Boulez, Stockhausen, and Nono. Many know these composers as being extremely mathematical (which I have a personal problem with, though it is not incorrect) and having music born not out of an inner, but rather completely by a systematic logic.


Peter began to wonder why this was.


And so did someone else.


There was another man on a Fulbright at the same time as Peter, to quote Peter, “he was viewing the world of music as pinpoints through a curtain,” though he was fairly overwhelmed by it all at first.


One day, which exhibited a similar amount of control that they themselves were using?


The gentlemen pondered this for a while and eventually had a large epiphany.


Let us again orient ourselves in time. Most of the Darmstadt composers were beginning to become active during and after World War II. Dr. Westergaard made it an extreme point to note a conversation that he had with another man (whose name escapes me) about how some words were no longer used in Germany for a large number of years. Words that were commonplace before the Third Reich had been completely adopted and bastardized by the group, Mozart, and many other Germans/Austrians as its own. This music is among the most romantic music that there is. Imagine hearing Beethoven and having it only associated with the single most terrible experience that you have ever had to endure in your life, and experience that was endured with millions around the world. Imagine Beethoven being the rallying music of the group causing that suffering.


The Darmstadt guys rejected their romantic pull because romanticism could be no more. It couldn’t. Peter said one thing that caught me off guard, the uniforms, the unbelievably naive goals. It makes sense.


To go back to that would have been too painful. Romanticism has reached critical mass and exploded. Here, and Nono. I’ve always found their music touching, but it really is something different if you consider the time period. This music is not devoid of emotion or any type of attachable meaning. This is a music of the most severe pain, a music of starting over without any reference whatsoever to the romantic works of old. Absolutely none.


It is also worth noting that Boulez, German, and Italian (respectively).


So Peter and the Hungarian both thought that it made sense. If your house ends up getting destroyed


It is also worth noting that the Hungarian’s name was Gyorgy Ligeti.


This is just one story, ever hear about, and I have a first hand source. I will update this periodically, because this is information that I believe needs to be shared.


It should also be noted that no one is saying that the Darmstadt guys were the only valid way to go. They were simply one of the trajectories that music took.",self,t5_2qhyq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/17lto9/here_is_a_bit_of_music_history_that_i_have_gotten/

[Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy)

**Wagner ruined tonality for everybody**

Young Claude came of age (age ten, Farrenc, Gounod; later, Fauré, d'Indy, Milhaud, Messaien), who stretched Western harmony, where independent, for

**Touched by magic**

Debussy attended Wagner's personal opera house in Bayreuth in 1888 and 1889, to have been the grandmaster of the Priory of Sion, which guards the Holy Grail). He heard Javanese gamelan music at an exhibition, and realized it was possible to have complex and honest music without any of the trappings of Western rhythm, melody, harmony, or texture (it ""contained all gradations, so that tonic and dominant were nothing more than empty phantoms of use to clever little children""); this is likely where he became interested in pentatonic scales. It was also around this time that he met the enigmatic umbrella-fancier Erik Satie

**Debussy stakes out new musical territory**

Debussy developed a music style unlike anything previous: he occasionally or even thoroughly abandoned tonality and key, they were as likely to be the Phrygian mode or whole-tone scale as anything else. He explored the use of unlimited harmonies and forms to create pure musical soundscapes rather than any familiar structure, and this was a huge influence on all but the most regressive composers who followed. Debussy's style is sometimes called ""musical impressionism"", a term he attributed to ""imbeciles"", ""which is as poorly used as possible, particularly by the critics"", though some scholars think he was reacting to negative criticism and would be pleased to be heard the way we see the impressionists today.

I am 25 years old and in my surroundings no one plays an instrument and no one listens to classical music. But January the 1st of this year I was just getting out of bed and turned on the TV and the Vienna New Year's Concert was on. I decided to listen to it while I made breakfast and see what it was. I sat down and listened to the whole thing feeling a bit overwhelmed. So I started to read about classical music and tried to find out if anyone I knew knew something about it so that I could ask them questions. As I expected no one did and everyone looked at me funny when I talked about it. I read a lot online of course and eventually I made a list for myself with about 10 famous composers and some of their works and wrote down what I though about it.   

The thing is

So basically my question is, the instruments etc. Also if there is a redditor from the Netherlands here, I don't got a lot of funds but I'd love to go to a live concert, any recommendations?

When he moved house in 1957, who supervised the cooking. Britten liked plain foods that reminded him of the foods during his schoolboy days, including rice pudding and [spotted dick](http://www.ocado.com/cmscontent/recipe_image_large/33932.jpg?TsA). He intensely disliked shellfish, despite living on the English coast, and a number of other foods such as mushrooms, tomatoes, and pears. He would sometimes consume a whole tin of condensed milk. But he had a taste for fine wines. Britten's BF Peter Pears was more of a gourmet. 

Britten kept to an orderly schedule. He woke up early, he wrote letters and took walks with his dachshunds and paying attention to the birds he saw. 

Tea (the meal) was an important part of the day. Britten couldn't cook for shit - according to Pears, he would read or listen to music on records before bed, often with the score of a string quartet.

Now maybe you're thinking, but why is classical music (in general) the only form of music that is taken seriously in the academic community? If I go to a state university to pursue a degree in music, I will only be exposed to classical music (and some jazz). So when I ask the question regarding a genre of music's superiority, I'm referring to its academic merit.

So, just say ""ah, Bach"".) Why best? Read on!

**Life and times**

Briefly, to see the great composer and organist [Dieterich Buxtehude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieterich_Buxtehude). Afterward, his appointments were as music director in noble courts and a church: first somewhat briefly in Weimar, then briefly in Köthen, and finally a long time in Leipzig. He was responsible for directing small orchestras and choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as music education, and had the consequence that his earlier work is largely secular and his later work largely sacred (based on Lutheran translations). This also means he didn't really do opera

**Fame**

Bach was at best somewhat well-known in his lifetime but especially obscure afterward. He was certainly recognized as an unequaled keyboard player; one of his side jobs was testing out new organs for their manufacturers and it's rumored that his [ubiquitous *D minor Toccata and Fugue*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd_oIFy1mxM) was written to help him stress-test their power and responsiveness. There is a story that a famous French organist had challenged him to a keyboard contest, the Frenchman called it off!

However, including the work of his sons [J.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Christian_Bach), [C.P.E.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach), [J.C.F.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Christoph_Friedrich_Bach), and [W.F.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach) He remained a little bit of a cult classic: Mozart and Beethoven were both introduced to his work late in their lives and frantically started writing fugues as a result. But he didn't really reappear for the general public until [Mendelssohn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn) revived interest with a performance of the masterpiece oratorio [*The Passion According to St. Matthew*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2XUaCWezRY). Other works were only gradually rediscovered; the famous solo sonatas/partitas/suites that every string player learns as a student were only resurrected for that purpose by [Joachim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Joachim) in the late 1800s ([violin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Lq1nHRp24)) and [Casals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Casals) in the early 1900s ([cello](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHhtSm5bfmM)).

**Why he's so damn famous**
 
Of course, but there are a lot of rules it has to follow. They may seem arbitrary when described, but they're glaringly obvious if you hear them broken. This is difficult, maybe a bit like solving a Sudoku except it has as many columns as the piece has measures, and there's no guaranteed solution, and it's under a bigger variety of constraints, and it needs an overarching musical structure to make it sound appealing. The difficulty increases exponentially with the number of voices. Two make a good challenge, and four is a show-stopper. For example (nearly every textbook example of counterpoint is from Bach)

In 1747, on the spot, to improvise a three-voice fugue based on a complex theme of the king's own invention. He did. (This is shocking.) Then Frederick challenged him to do it with *six* voices, which everyone thought was a joke. A short time later, Bach mailed him [precisely that, in what would become part of a suite of clever, punny variations on the King's theme

But I want to impress on you that **Bach is notable for his emotional appeal, and is still meant to arouse feeling in the listener. To persuade you of that, I'll just let Bach speak for himself:

* [Chaconne from *D minor partita for solo violin*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zvRWFD_1_M)
* [*""Come,_s%C3%BC%C3%9Fer_Tod,_komm_selge_Ruh); here the fabulous Virgil Fox performs it on a ridiculously large organ. Subwoofer recommended.
* The aforementioned [*St. Matthew Passion*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1Q3tcnZxdc). Note that I link to a slow, and this certainly isn't it. But I'm using this hysterically uninformed performance to make a point about Bach's emotional impact, so there.
* Finally, frohlocket"", the opening of the *Christmas Oratorio*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggm0SZCWKZo), which I gather is as much of an annual festivity in the German-speaking world as [Handel's *Messiah*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_(Handel\)) is in the English-speaking one. Lucky krauts. This time we see [John Eliot Gardiner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eliot_Gardiner), a superb conductor of Bach and a reliable HIPster.

So! I hope that's enough to get you started. More stories or impressions of Bach? And it's open season for Bach-related [submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/submit) in /r/classicalmusic!",self,t5_2qhyq,True,,schnittke,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/pccko/februarys_composer_of_the_month_is_johann/

You also don't have to rely on the sound guy to mix the ensemble which can be quite problematic

You may be saying to yourself (in a 1950s voice at that!), that sounds great, but I just don't have that kind of money to get those expensive tickets..."" **WRONG!** If you are a student, most orchestras including some of the top ones, like the [New York Phil](http://nyphil.org/studentrush/) and the [Chicago Symphony](http://cso.org/TicketsAndEvents/Students.aspx/) have student tickets for around $10. Orchestras tend to play the standard repertoire of pieces, so there are usually more recognized names on the program list.

Not a student? Not a problem. If you are by a university with any kind of music program or school, you will hear some standard repertoire, but you are also very likely to be exposed to contemporary composers and to many pieces you might not have listened to just on your own.

Unfortunately, one of the most renowned american symphony orchestras, was forced to file for bankruptcy in the last year. Go out and see one of their concerts and you are helping to give some financial support to these great organizations that preserve the great tradition of western classical music. Plus, everybody would love to see more young people attend classical music concerts. The old people because the tradition is continuing; the young people because they won't feel like the youngest people there.

Two examples that I can think of off the top my head are Wagner's main theme to Ride of the Valkyries (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V92OBNsQgxU, 7:00-7:45).  

But let's not limit this to main themes - the melody can be a transition, anything.

I wonder if perhaps they got lost at the other show I did today

Well as luck would have it another member of the orchestra gets a hold of a friend that has some reeds much closer. I meet up with her

Get back to the show, no biggie.

Start playing, so I can deal.

Intermission I take a moment to carve the reed a bit, no biggie...

1/3rd of the way in to the 2nd act one blade of the reed decides it's tired of being one piece and splits about halfway down to the wire...which makes playing about 3 times harder

**PRELUDE**

 

Before booking a wedding, make sure to include in the terms and agreements that the musicians require a 500% deposit and leftover wedding cake.

 

When agreeing to play a wedding, accordion, or vuvuzela. You definitely do not also DJ, unless they want to hear Mozart’s “Jupiter” Symphony for all the single ladies on the dance floor.

 

Be sure to carefully outline that your musicians need armless chairs in which to play

 

If the bride is younger than 30, she might be Betty White and you are either incredibly lucky or completely screwed.

 

On that note, call her Mrs. [Groom’s Name], The Boss, or Princess. Never refer to her mother as “whatserface” either (at least not within earshot of the bride).

 

When she mentions that this is “the most important day of her life

 

Always make sure to ask whether the wedding is indoor or outdoor.

 

*If it is outdoor between the dates of April 1st and October 31st,” but “Rainbow Connection” is okay. (“Tomorrow” from Annie is a lovely choice as long as no one sings along.)


*If it doesn’t rain, sunblock, bug spray, and a parka.


*Under NO circumstances should you wear sunglasses


*If it is moved indoor because of inclement weather


*If it is indoor regardless of the date or the weather

 

*When the bridal couple respond to your email with what appears to be a completed contract attached

 

*If you speak to the groom at all, switch back to sports.

 

*If at any point during the planning process you hear the phrase “Disney wedding

 

**CEREMONY**

 

Brides think that musicians book events and then don’t show up. And as everyone knows

 

When you do finally arrive at the wedding site, so just do what she says. Never interrupt her when she is going through the list of events, as she has this memorized and has been practicing in front of the mirror for days.

 

Even though you are required to be at the wedding location from 10am to 6pm

 

There is usually music for the Seating of the Mothers. Just so you know, she will definitely know if you substitute “Air in G” or “Air in D” or “Hair in K flat,” because she has perfect pitch and is a Bach scholar. So it’s better to either just stick with “Arioso,” or play Van Halen’s “Hot for Teacher” because that’s what her husband sang to her in college.

 

One of the hardest parts during the ceremony is knowing when the bridesmaids are done filing in and the bride enters – in other words

If the bride went to state school, so you just have to guess and say that it’s safe to play the Canon about 80 times with repeats, or the equivalent of one episode of Jersey Shore.


Whether the bride went to state school or not


When the bride does finally arrive in the entranceway, then snap back to reality and play the “Wedding March” as you have never played it before. When she is precisely 5 more steps down the aisle, she will be cognizant of nothing but the adoration of the entire world shining upon her from the church pews, and you can take your snack break while she walks the rest of the way down.

 

During the ceremony, 25 points if you win a game of Draw Something.

 

If this is a Jewish wedding, who also nodded off.

 

If this is any kind of Greek or Italian wedding, so don’t even try. Uncle Cal is also married but will ask you to marry him anyway. Little Rico is only 17, but look what a sweet guy he is, in twenty years you won’t know the difference, and he inherits the family pizza shop, won’t that be nice!

 

Modern Quaker weddings are beautiful. Wear a shirt with a peace sign

 

Speaking of outdoor ceremonies, plus what the bride doesn’t know is crawling up her gown won’t hurt her.

 

Asking for payment on the day of the wedding is severely insensitive

 

**RECESSIONAL**

 

You might get asked to play cocktail hour. For this they will pay you at least minimum wage to sit and watch Uncle Cal dance

 

The groomsman with whom you have been playing Draw Something will at some point come over thinking he is really slick, and politely take your leave. Unless she asks you to play the reception, and then you are screwed.

 

If you do play the reception, and immediately book a wedding and get her to sign a contract before she can say “slide to the left.” For the reception you can play absolutely anything you want, because string players are cool when they play pop music. If you know any Deadmau5 you will be the talk of the bridal party for years to come.

 

When the guests are looking sleepy and Uncle Cal can no longer throw his hands on his knees, leftover wedding cake stored in the freezer, and the bride signing divorce papers in the 2nd most important day of her life. Then, and only then, it is okay to pack up your instrument and go home.",,False,t5_2qhyq,True

* The formula that seems to be working for the other subreddits is to have [a designated monthly submission thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/j6e1f/submit_and_vote_for_the_september_books_of_the/) wherein redditors put forth ideas. 

* The choices are then [announced in a designated thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/kyl6k/the_books_for_november_have_been_chosen/)

* Then there is [a discussion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/k17di/discussion_thread_catch22_by_joseph_heller/) that floats around the subreddit for the rest of the month where people go to have one long conversation about it.

I love listening to pieces of music with the score. Particularly orchestral works that are somewhat ambitious in scope... lately, and listening, I feel like I'm going on some sort of excessively revealing adventure through someone's mind. And I feel the same as when I think of some kind of rich and vast fictional universe... every page has some kind of a story to it, and what represents 5 seconds of music can take hours to compose, or (when analyzing) de-composing.

I've been developing a huge interest in English music of the 20th century, every page has so much flavour to it, and by and large it makes me want to delve into the music even more. It's hard to describe the feeling I get when a score hits me this hard, but I imagine it's a bit like being in the middle of some epic fantasy universe, and getting to know all its intimate details one by one.

That representation could have helped [this

finding his Chopin nocturne. If you go to that search engine and just type
*UDDDDUUDUDDDDUUD you'll have that nocturne in the results.

Of course that works well for pieces in which you don't have too many grace

The Rite is a ballet that depicts a pagan springtime fertility ritual culminating in a virgin sacrifice. The music is notable for its innovation in dissonance, though this might have been due more to the choreography than the music.

&gt; Recently Sergei Koussevitzky has performed Stravinsky's *Rite of Spring*

– [César Cui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Cui), 1984.

The piece has two parts: ""Adoration of the Earth"" and ""The Exalted Sacrifice"". Each of these contains a series of scenes

**Discussion points:**

Piece of the Week is intended for discussion and analysis as well as just listening. Here are a few thoughts to get things started:

* Is this the greatest chamber work ever written? If so
* How can we account for what Benjamin Britten called ""the most productive 18 months in our music history""? Did Schubert really have syphillis? Could his final creative outpouring have been caused by another illness?
* If you've listened to any of the period instrument performances that I've linked to above
* [Was Schubert gay? Does it matter?](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/04/arts/critic-s-notebook-was-schubert-gay-if-he-was-so-what-debate-turns-testy.html) Why/why not?
* Is Schubert's music full of self-pity? Do large doses of it make you miserable? Is it true that [he's nobody's favourite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1iqgne/very_intriguing_quote_about_schubert/)
* Does this work deserve the [very high levels of popularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_100_chamber_%28ABC%29) that it currently enjoys? Is the adagio getting too popular for its own good?
* Does anyone else love the scherzo in this piece as much as I do?
* This piece is often performed by string quartets augmented with an additional (and often [famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dziwGRNxw)) cellist. Does this have any effect on the way it is played? Does the presence of a prominent soloist adversely affect this most co-operative of musical genres?
* How does this piece compare to the Trout Quintet? Which do you prefer
* How does this piece compare to Mozart's quintets
* Is Schubert's chamber music his greatest contribution
* If Schubert had lived longer
* Can someone explain to me what is so great/interesting about Schubert's harmonies/modulation between different keys?
* Schubert was incredibly prolific - what is your favourite lesser-known work of his?
* Is Schubert more like Mozart

Follow along with the Grooveshark link here:

Now, meant something very simple - just a piece without voice. There was the concerto, just instrumental, and then there was the cantata, instruments with voice.


The violin, new works began to feature this instrument. The most prominent and important composer was a man named Arcangelo Corelli.


* 1. Corelli - Trio Sonata in B minor Opus 1 No.6 - Largo

Corelli is the granddaddy of violin technique. Period. Everything comes from this guy - and for good reason. He wrote for the violin really

The core of his output was the 'Trio sonata'. You get a violin, of course, steals the show.


* 2-4. Vivaldi - Concerto in G Minor Op. 8 No. 2 Summer

You've heard this piece before. Or at least the beginning set of movements. It's from the Four Seasons. Composers everywhere took to the violin


If the ridiculous fingerwork wasn't enough of a hint, and it was here to stay.


*  5. W.A. Mozart - Violin Concerto No. 5 Mvmt. 3

At this point



*  6-8. Mendelssohn - Concerto In E Minor

This piece is the 50-cal of the violin concerto arsenal. It's the Michael Jordan of the violin concerto basketball team. It's kind of a big deal. If you're a violinist, sweat, and tears for everyone. Really young kids are made to learn this piece at a young age, and I don't think people realize how outstandingly hard this piece is to play well. There's so much little detail in this piece - that opening melody is written to feature the E-string, the brightest and most piercing sound possible. Every musical idea melts into the next. Mendelssohn spent 10 years on this piece - and I think it shows. A critical piece of the repertoire.



*  9-11. Bruch - Violin Concerto No.1 in G minor Op.26

This is the other really big violin concerto. We're now sitting at the last part of the 19th century


*  12. Brahms - Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D major

This is a terrifying violin concerto. It stopped being hard a while ago and started being sadistic. But is it worth it? Oh, it's Brahms. Listen to the entire concerto if you have time - and you'll need time. The first movement is 18 minutes long.


*  13. Sibelius - Violin Concerto in D Minor

If you listen to just one song on this list, this has entered the repertoire recently, but solidly. It's also freakin' hard to play (but, hey, everything else on this list is, so what's new?).


*  14. Bartok - Violin Concerto No. 2

This piece, for better or for worse. I was also foolish enough to try to learn this monstrous piece (oh god the double stops at 4:15). It calls for an absolutely mammoth orchestra, but is orchestrated so exquisitely well that the violin is always easily heard. It's a whirlwind. Listen to the whole thing if you have the time. Oh, and check out the tone row at 3:00.


*  15-17. Karol Szymanowski - Violin Concerto No. 1 Op. 35

To round off this list - a piece by a certain Polish composer. Not written too long after Prelude to the Afternoon of a Fawn, that includes the Bartok). It's also rather obscure, but I think it has enough merit to warrant a bit more attention. Give this piece a chance - it opens up and explodes like a flower made of nitroglycerin.

Anyway, so we might be good.

Second, these people are looking for specific suggestions. I really like the ""New here? Here's a useful..."" reference thing we have to the right, but I think we should be very careful NOT to discourage people from posting their own ""Where should I start with classical music?"" posts. This is because, from our vast source of pooled knowledge of classical music, we can personalize suggestions for each user. 

Also, etc., among us. Other subreddits, like we are the music makers or whatever, are tailored to people who make music very different from classical music. If I were to ask for opinions on my own music, I'd bring it to classicalmusic before anywhere else. Maybe we could have a posting that lists redditor's performances and concerts? Also, more people should be encouraged to post their music! I would

These are just some ideas off the top of my head. Hopefully this sparks some dialogue that improves the above ideas

**edit: Findings:**

1. **LESS LURKING, so make sure to add a jumping off point to your youtube links! Research the piece a little maybe!

2. **Advertise us!** Post stuff to other subreddits! If you post something to classical music, only some downvotes maybe. Let's try to get listed on the side of other subreddits, like music, because apparently there are people who don't realize there's a classical music subreddit. And maybe, just maybe, we can get people to see that classical music fulfills needs that popular music simply can't.

3. **More mods!** Especially if we want to get more stuff going on here. I know I

Let's do this! Although we're small

Further notes: Let's compile a list of classical music blogs/web sites/etc. (we get new york times/new yorker articles from time to time) that we can raid for articles and other interesting posts. I'll try to google some later when I can and add them here.

Now I am hearing constant doom and gloom about orchestras shutting down, no one buys CDs etc, and overall ""less and less people listen to classical music.""

Regardless whether all not some or all of these points are true...

I'm wondering what we

1. Classical music is harder to listen to and (IMO) requires more focus and background knowledge to fully appreciate. Where as most popular music is specifically written to be 'easy' to hear. I made a real conscious effort to get into classical music and still it took me a while

2. the term classical music has so many negative connotations in many people's eyes. Like ""boring""

3. Most people's idea of what classical music sounds like is limited to something like the Four Seasons

I'd love to make a top 100 classical album and fill it with Schoenberg and Varese. 

4. the consensus on contempoary compositions seems to be ""impossible to listen to mathematics with very fancy scores"" but anything more tuneful or consonant gets labelled neo-classical.

I think what we really need, go to concerts, have heard a large amount of repertoire.

Excuse my blog. I don't think classical music is dying as people have been claiming for years
