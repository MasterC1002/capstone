**Preface**

The MFA basic wardrobe is very general to fit a vast majority of people. This guide is much more specific to ages up to 18 as beyond that, as I know most teenagers don’t have a lot of money (or jobs to earn it). Just remember that, most of the time, you get what you pay for.

Remember, nothing can make expensive clothes look cheap like a bad fit. OTR (off the rack) clothing sizes have a huge variation depending on the manufacturer—the small shirt that may fit you perfectly in one brand could be like a compression shirt in another.  

Check out the guide
*****

**Shirts** – The basic design of suits, but stay away from brand names, band tees, and “vintage graphic tees”.

* [**Mossimo V-Necks** - $10](http://bit.ly/Tcfwsz) – Multiple colors, black, and white for starters – you can find these at target, they’re slim fitting and v-necked. Similar:  [**Gap Crew**](http://gap.us/10AsGBN) and [**Gap V**](http://gap.us/Wnoy2H) These are my favorite. Really comfortable, last forever, and if you get them in store, they’re always super cheap (especially if your mom frequently gets discounts).

* [**Mossimo Polo** - $15](http://bit.ly/XSgo3m) – Multiple colors

* **Henleys** [**Uniqlo Long Sleeve** - $13](http://bit.ly/10Foa5c) and [**American Eagle Short Sleeve** - $15](http://on.ae.com/SxLEFA) – Good alternative to t shirts and look good layered under casual button-downs. **Side note**: I wouldn’t normally suggest AE as a good brand

**Button-Downs** – This is a place to remember how important fit is: OTR button down shirts may (and a lot of the time *will*) need tailoring. As a *guideline*

* [**Uniqlo Casual Shirts** - $10-30](http://bit.ly/RRM2Kx) – Great shirts

* [**Mossimo Flannels** - ~$23](http://bit.ly/TdFnQV) – Few options online

* [**Lands End Canvas (LEC) Twill Workshirt** – $30](http://bit.ly/Su1VeK)

* **H&amp;M** - $10-30 – H&amp;M has an awful online store but generally has a large range in store. Fit is pretty slim but construction is on the poor end.

* [**LEC Oxford Cloth Button-Down (OCBD)** - $30-40](http://bit.ly/Klm9Ou) – Have sales very often. White/blue are the typical basic colors to get.

* [**Alfani Red “Dress” and “Sport” Shirts** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/VWGtj7) – Sales often. Good slim shirts

* [**J Crew Factory Sport and Dress Shirts** - $20-40](http://bit.ly/XT6nmg) – Sales are frequent and so are email promo codes. Fits quite well

* [**Uniqlo Dress Shirts** - $10-30](http://bit.ly/TZnK16) – Same as above qlo description.

*****

**Pants**

**Jeans** – Most likely will be your most used item and a staple for your wardrobe. Stick to dark indigo and slim fitting.

* [**Uniqlo Jeans** - $50-90](http://bit.ly/Xxd6zG) – Good quality

* [**Levi’s 511** - ~$40](http://amzn.to/VOfnKe) – Slim fit tapered leg. Clean Dark and Rigid Dragon are safe.

* [**Levi’s 508** - ~$40](http://amzn.to/141s0V4) – Less slim fit but more thigh room. Go with the Rigid Envy.

* My recommendation: [**Unbranded Selvedge** - $78](http://urbout.co/WcmAnF) – Hop on the raw denim hype you’ve heard all about. Probably the best cheap option out there and well worth it

**Cords** – A good F/W option. Earthy tones work well here as does navy. Make sure the wale (cord width) is thin.

**Chinos** – Known as khakis (khaki is the popular color and chino is the material).

* [**Uniqlo Chinos** - $40](http://bit.ly/11QkPjZ) – Quite slim fitting

* [**Dockers Alpha Khaki** - $45](http://amzn.to/10lsx0d) – Slim fitting (close to Levi’s 511). Navy and earth tones are good color options.

* [**Dockers D1** - $37-45](http://amzn.to/WSsiaM) – Slim straight cut (no taper past the knee).

**Shorts** – Slim, just keep them from being man-pris and you’ll be ok). RL Rugby has good options, as does LEC and J Crew.

*****

**Layering** – Good casual options are hoodies, and more smart-casual are cardigans and v-necks.

* [**Gap Crew Neck Sweater** – $40](http://gap.us/10lwQZm) – Versatile: can be worn layering

* **Hoodies** H&amp;M has good cheap (in store) hoodies. Light gray and navy are good colors

* [**Qlo Thick Knit Cardigan** – $20](http://bit.ly/VmfATC) – Warm layering piece. Good for “easing” your way into wearing cardigans.

* **Qlo Cardigans** [**Merino Wool** - $20](http://bit.ly/VWKIeK) and [**Lambswool** - $20](http://bit.ly/UOgqIW)

* **Gap V-Neck Sweaters** [**Merino Wool** - Currently on sale $34](http://gap.us/YjY6vG) – Quality is so-so

*****

**Shoes**

**Sneakers/Casual Shoes** – Going to be the biggest option here as sneakers are going to be the most useful for teens.

* **Canvas** – [**Vans Authentic** - $40](http://amzn.to/XwdaQh) Vans stores also always have authentics if you can’t get your size online. True-White is the best color here. Other options are [**Converse Chuck Taylors** - $50](http://amzn.to/WeVD2J) – go for the Optical White and [**Jack Purcells** - $60](http://amzn.to/Ws680F) – White/White colorway.

* **Skate shoes** – Tread very carefully here (pun *completely* intended), also check out the customizable ones if you’re ok paying a little more [**Adidas Campus Vulc** - $50-75](http://bit.ly/Wjvo89) and [**Campus 2** - $50-75](http://amzn.to/10C0yhO)

* [**Espadrilles** - $28-45](http://bit.ly/K0b7NZ) – Good summer casual footwear.

* [**Vans C&amp;L 59**](http://bit.ly/102s03i) – Good casual shoe with a small addition of leather.

**Leather shoes**

* [**Sperry A/O** - $80](http://bit.ly/VWMbkZ) – best colors are Sahara

* [**CDBs** - $80](http://amzn.to/UgJzNO) – You better know them. I refuse to say ~~anything~~ much about them because I see them so often I’ve grown quite a distaste for them. They are still a great option and very versatile.

* **Bucks** [**Bass Buckingham** - $80](http://bit.ly/1072BtT) – Awesome shoes. Best colors are going to be taupe suede (referred to as “dirty bucks”) or white. Make sure to let them get dirty from wear and they’ll look even better.

* **Dress Shoes** – Check MFA’s [Shoe Guide](http://redd.it/p7usf) for a much more thorough guide. I would stick to a black cap-toe, chances are you won’t need them often and you will have plenty of time for formalwear the rest of your life.

*****

**Accessories**

* **Watch** – [**Timex Weekender** - $25-30](http://amzn.to/tAicM4) or [**Timex Easy Reader** - $25-30](http://amzn.to/Yk16bD) – Self explanatory

* **Belt** – Buy one, [make your own](http://redd.it/k6uro).

* **Hats** – As teenagers, as it’s a baseball cap), or the official [MFA x Ebbets custom cap](http://redd.it/16r48w).

*****

**To Wrap it Up**

Try to build your wardrobe **slowly**. Don’t rush it, 2) don’t fit, or 3) aren’t versatile at all. You should also take it slow so you don’t blow the sparse amount of money you likely have.

**Good big brand stores**

* [**Uniqlo**](http://www.uniqlo.com) – Online store recently added. MFA’s lovechild for cheap

* [**H&amp;M**](http://www.hm.com) – Better in store options than online. Very cheap

* [**Target**](http://www.target.com) – Has good options on a budget. Check out what [Primer](http://bit.ly/qcXaUl) has to say on Target.

* [**Gap**](http://www.gap.com) – Decent quality and frequent sales. Gap has been stepping up their game recently and has been offering better clothes.

* [**Old Navy**](http://www.oldnavy.com) – Similar to Gap

***

As this subreddit is made for teenagers, age, occasion, the season, and even the type of school are the most important factors to consider.

**Factors**

***

*Region* - Different regions typically have different styles. What's standard in the south could be ridiculous in the north
 
*Social position* - Let's be honest. People who are more popular can generally get away with more than the average person. Of course, it's constantly noted that famous people can pull off things that normal people could almost never pull off by virtue of their fame. This factor in appropriate dress is essentially the high school version of that. This is also likely one of the most abstract factors but when in doubt, keep it safe.

*Age* - TeenMFA caters to a wide audience. 13 year olds to 19 year olds all fit the teen description, an 18 year old wearing a button down tucked into chinos with wingtips? *May* not raise eyebrows (again, the other factors come into play here). Might even be pulled off with aplomb. A 13 year old wearing the same? Almost certainly will be a strange sight, and more importantly, almost certainly will be ridiculed. Please don't put yourself through that.

*Occasion* - Obviously, but a button down and chinos? Absolutely appropriate for the occasion. Or say you're getting ready for a pickup game of basketball with some friends - what's more appropriate, your jeans, or some athletic shorts? In short, the occasion at hand is a very important factor in the appropriateness of your dress.

*Season* - Seasonal clothing is fairly straightforward and a lot of this is basically common sense. Still, they’re not seasonally appropriate in Fall/Winter, especially as time goes on. Other examples like this would be seersucker clothing, linen clothing, and usually shorts (in certain more temperate regions they may be fine). Likewise, things like thick knit sweaters, wool coats like peacoats or duffle coats

*Type of school* - this is probably the most obvious. The common types of schooling are private school, this guide will cater most to you. Private school students - uniforms are fairly common at private schools, and as such, chinos, polos, button downs, and perhaps even blazers may be not only standard, this is likely the most important factor for you. Not every private school is like this of course, the other factors will still be relevant outside of school though.

***

Now, there is a certain bottom line. Sweatpants, gym shorts, [slides]( http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;amp;amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;amp;amp;tid=12914512), running shoes, and the like (athletic apparel basically) should all be kept to the home, the gym, they can be fine, but in most places, but it’s less of a clear one. Blazer/chinos pairings or suits would most likely be this upper line but of course

**T-shirts**

* [Crew neck t-shirts](http://i.imgur.com/mddmW.jpg) are the simplest of all casual shirts. Anyone can pull them off and they are a lot of people’s go-to shirt when it comes to casual wear. Compared to scoop necks and v-necks

* [V-neck t-shirts](http://i.imgur.com/TfC63.jpg) are less restrictive around your neck compared to crew necks and are slowly gaining popularity among the masses of men's clothing. Unless you go to a really rural school you should see lots of guys wearing these.

* [Scoop neck t-shirts](http://i.imgur.com/ByVNW.jpg) are the least conservative and least popular of the three many types of t-shirts. I do not recommend wearing these until you are confident in your sense of style as they can look extremely feminine when done wrong.

* [Henleys](http://i.imgur.com/suvoLh.jpg) can look great in place of a crew or v-neck if you have a muscular build. I recommend getting a long sleeve one like TheNicolai because really, it's worth noting that unless you're extremely fit, the short sleeve versions will look bad.

**[Polo shirts](http://i.imgur.com/QA0MI.jpg)** are a great step between casual t-shirts and button ups. Polos are common around high schools and can look great when worn with a pair of [jeans and some nice leather shoes](http://i.imgur.com/jotx9.jpg). Boat shoes also look great with polos

**Button up shirts** are whole new territory and are probably the hardest to pull off when it comes to everyday high school life. Even though it can be a challenge, if your shirt is rather long, keep it tucked in as it will appear to fit you better. Second, keep in mind the [appropriateness of the occasion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/wlj36/the_teenmfa_guide_to_dressing_appropriately/) as it will make or break your outfit. Two other things to remember when wearing a button up is that [rolling up your sleeves](http://i.imgur.com/7IYyr.jpg) will instantly make a button up more age appropraite, the second thing to remember is that unless you are extremely fit and secure in your sense of style, short sleeve button ups should be avoided as they can appear to be extremely childish or dad-like if you're not. When picking out button up shirts for school, a few recommended patterns are [gingham](http://cluemagazine.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ginghamshirt.jpg), [madras](http://i.imgur.com/cBn9Lh.jpg)

As always no matter what you wear, and the situation you are in, so make sure that you are not overdressing or not confident in taking the next steps in your wardrobe, because not only make the clothes look bad but you may look worse than before you started dressing nicely to begin with.

Like all the other guides this is a work in progress and if you feel that something should be added

A good-looking haircut is extremely important too.

• But what's more important in high school is having *your own style*. A style that describes **you**. It's what sets you apart

• Some 'fashion rules' apply only to adults in the *fucking adult world*, and make it look good-- fucking do it. 

• Don't be afraid to wear shirts with different-designed pockets, high school and college are the times to dress *however the fuck you want, and actually be able to get away with it.* 

Having said all that, but especially clothes that are a little more crazy than the average kid trying to act twice his age. Clothes that are 'out-there' describe me a little better.

**TL;DR** Your style should match your personality; your style should match how you feel about yourself.

1329270820.0,pq1m2,Spring/Summer Guide for Teens,WheelinMachine,60,13,22,"Well it's just around the corner though it may not seem like it for some of you with snow still on the ground but I felt this subreddit needs to have it's own guides mainly because things in the MFA guides do not apply or are missing things that matter to teens so this will be built around there guides but changed to things that are more appropriate for are age.
  
**Shirts/Tops -** Fit is very important during the summer because you cannot layer with jackets and such to hide something that does not fit as well. I feel the main shirt for summer for teens should be one color or striped (if you have a fit/athletic build) tees/V-Neck tees
  
**Bottoms -** Shorts are what you are going to mainly be wearing. You don`t need to wear shorts as short as the guys in MFA
  
**Shoes -** My favorite part of summer is wearing shoes sock-less which is what I recommend you do in conjunction with a pair of insoles made for being worn with bare feet. But if you're not into that buy some socks that don't show wearing socks above your shoes with shorts does not look good. Try and limit your flip flop wearing to be only on the beach but if you live somewhere where people wear them generally then it is ok. Avoid wearing high top shoes and mid top shoes with shorts you want something that is light weight and low cut. You can't go wrong with a pair of boat shoes during the summer. Wear lightweight canvas sneakers and shoes as they look best with shorts. Some good options are, or brown chukkas will do also note then tennis shoes should not be worn unless going to the gym or participating in a sport if you did not know that.

**Hats -** As you're a teenager you can still make flat brim caps look good
  
**Sunglasses -** Unless you plan to take care of them don't buy any thing expensive. My advice is see what people where you live are wearing and get something that reflects that style. If you do want to buy a good pair make sure they fit your face properly and are exactly what you want.  
  
**Jackets -** All you will need if anything is something lightweight and waterproof for rainy days. I suggest looking at street wear brands for a rain jacket as they usually have a lot of good choices.  
   
**Sweaters -** Exactly the same as in the MFA guide. (link below)  
  
Use this in conjunction with [The MFA Summer Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/oqc1c/springsummer_guide_v20/) to pick out a great summer wardrobe please comment and tell me what you think as this is my first guide.

At least 4 Shirts

Right now you may still be growing at a rapid pace, but I would only buy from them if you really like something or if you think that you are slowing down your growth rate. 

At least 7 T-shirts

For T-Shirts in high school it's okay to wear graphic tees. People at MFA don't like them because they make you look like a teenager. Well, or douchey patterns. Find t-shirts that are utilized as a canvas instead of a billboard. You can find t-shirts like these at http://www.threadless.com/ or http://www.designbyhumans.com/ . But there are some shirts here that still violate these rules. 

Even if you do choose to get graphic tees

**Pants**

At least 3 Pairs

For jeans, or 511s, depending on how you like the fit. I personally go with 514s. Like shirts, if you feel like you are more or less done growing if you can shell out for some of the more expensive stuff. I plan on picking up a pair of Naked and Famous raw dark indigo slim guy jeans for $140. I'll let you guys know how that goes.

Chinos may look a little too preppy depending on where you go to school

**Shoes**

At least 2 Pairs

I recommend getting a pair of casual shoes  and a pair of athletic shoes only for sports and working out. For the majority of you, etc) are your best bet. Skate shoes are okay since we are teenagers if you get them in simple patterns [such as](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/l3a.html?categoryId=10105#variation-3) if you actually skate. For those of you in your later teens feel free to be adventurous and to try some of the stuff MFA would suggest for casual occasions (lol Desert Boots). 

**Bags**

Unless you have a laptop, and cost effectiveness of a solid colored Jansport.

**Outerwear**

[Only get solid colored hoodies.](http://www.americanapparel.com/f497.html?cid=210). For warmer weather get a few cardigans in  colors that work with what you normally wear.

I'm from San Diego so I'll need some help with winter coat advice.

**Accessories and Various**
A watch can really pull together an outfit. I'll just give the cliche MFA citation Timex Easy Reader or Seiko 5 with assorted NATO Straps.

Get your socks and underwear at Costco or  at a store like Ross or TJ Maxx. Get your underwear however but white socks are only for athletics. For normal wear

A lot of places clothing stores tend to sell headphones devices with fashion being their primary function. As what most people would call an ""audiophile"", or Beats headphones I wish I can go back in time to the person's infancy so I can push their soft spot in. Seriously, don't buy [overpriced shit sounding cheesy looking headphones](http://files.headphoneconert-rigi.webnode.com/200000002-02cdb03c82/Skullcandy_Give-away.JPG). Stick with quality brands that actually make stuff for the pro audio market like [Sennheiser](http://cdn.cbsi.com.au/story_media/339298598/sennheiser_hd_448_1.jpg), [Shure](http://www.gearculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/shure-professional-headphones.jpg), [Audio-Technica](http://gadgets.softpedia.com/images/gadgets/gallery/large/The-Audio-Technica-ATH-AD700-Headphones-1.png), or [Grado](http://gearcrave.frsucrave.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/gradosr80.jpg). A pair of these will last you years and you will never want to listen to music anyway else after using a good pair of headphones.

1359003846.0,1769ji,Comprehensive Shoe Guide,Eck32,46,5,28,"**How to use the guide**
This guide is pretty simple. It has a few prefaces so you can get some quick facts about shoes in general, as often as I could, the original manufacturer. Typically, manufacturers are far more expensive to buy from than zappos or amazon or ebay. More on where to buy shoes later.

When it comes to shoes, you can experiment with more interesting shoes. The biggest thing you want to avoid is trainers/running shoes in place of actual casual shoes.


**Regarding the shape of shoes**

Right now, as they are more natural looking than square toed or pointed shoes.


**On Leather Shoes**

Just because a shoe is leather *does not* mean that it is formal. All the shoes listed here are casual

**Plimsolls**

Plimsoll canvas sneakers are great, basic color. If you're feeling lost and overwhelmed when it comes to shoes, just buy a gray pair of vans and it'll work with damn near everything. White is another great color, but you either need to get them really dirty for a rugged feel or keep them clean for a crisp look. Black is over rated if you ask me, as it doesn't look very good with blue(an integral color of a wardrobe). Bright colors work great in the summer, and sneakers with patterns are also a nice way to spice up a simple outfit. If you want a color that's versatile but off the beaten track, try maroon or olive.

* [vans authentics](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/41$.html) vans authentics are the simplest and arguably the most versatile canvas sneaker there is. They go great with shorts or jeans

* [Converse Jack Purcells](http://www.converse.com/#/products/collections/JackPurcell) These are nice

* [converse Chuck Taylors](http://www.converse.com/#/products/collections/ChuckTaylor) Chuck Taylors are much more iconic than the other choices. They have more branding and because of it give a more punk feel than the others

* [Vans C&amp;L Era 59](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/exdcal.html?vcategoryId=COREMETRICS_IO&amp;cm_vc=marketing&amp;cm_mmc=vans.com-_-marketing-_-Recommendations-_-C%26L+Era+59|EXDCAL) This is a more interesting line of canvas sneaker. They have leather accents that give it a different feel than the vans authentics

If you look around on the vans or converse websites for a little bit, but just look at it. Too often people buy shoes because they look *cool* and not aesthetically pleasing.

Also

**Boat Shoes**

Shopping for a boat shoe is very simple. Get a pair in basic leather colors, but I really don't think those look as good. You should wear boat shoes without socks(or with no-show socks; check the socks section), unless you really know what you're doing. Boat shoes are best with shorts, but passable with chinos.

* [Sperry Top-Sider](http://www.sperrytopsider.com/store/SiteController/sperry/productdetails?catId=cat90046DM&amp;subCatId=cat100064DM&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;stockNumber=0532002&amp;skuId=***7********0532002*M130&amp;productId=7-100210&amp;&amp;subCatId=cat100064DM&amp;productId=7-100210&amp;stockNumber=0532002&amp;subCatTabId=&amp;catId=cat90046DM&amp;productdisplayName=Men's+Authentic+Original+Boat+Shoe&amp;subcatdisplayName=Authentic+Originals&amp;skuId=***7********0532002*M130&amp;pageIdentifier=productdetail&amp;catdisplayName=Men&amp;showDefaultOption=true) These are by far the most common boat shoes, classic brown, or amaretto.

**Boots**
Ahh, otherwise they'll just fall apart. All the boots recommended on MFA are great, but as you're a teen and (probably) poor, you won't want to spend too much money on boots. Because of this, I will not cover boots here. If you're interested, check out [MFA's boot guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/z2quy/mfa_boot_guide_20122013/). It has everything you need to know about boots, as well as many great recommendations.

**Desert Boots**

Desert boots are categorized by their short height(for a boot) and few eyelets. Chukka boots are essentially the same thing, but aren't a good choice in wet weather. They go great with jeans or chinos, but do *not* wear them with shorts. You will look ridiculous.

* [Clark's Desert Boots](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Boot/dp/B0007MCUTK) These are the circlejerk shoe of /r/mfa, but it looks good in all kinds of colors: Gray, Neutral Suedes, and even navy. That said, the most versatile colors will be beeswax, tan suede, and gray. Personally, as they have next to no traction. [Clark's Bushacres](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Bushacre-Lace-Up-Boot/dp/B00B1I5KFU) are essentially the same shoe

**Penny Loafers**
I love penny loafers. They are great with shorts, but on the other hand they are also a little harder to pull off and even a hair more formal. For versatility's sake, grab brown penny loafers. Penny loafers were made popular long ago, and because of that there are plenty in thrift stores. There aren't any clearly superior penny loafer brands, so my advice is to just head to a thrift store and take a look at them.

Here are some pictures of Penny Loafers that look good: [1](http://theshoebuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Santoni-Percy-Penny-Loafer.jpg) [2]( http://cdnc.lystit.com/photos/2012/04/18/crockett-jones-tan-apron-toe-penny-loafer-product-1-3304996-528720554_large_flex.jpeg) Note the minimal stitching and simple sole.

**Other Sneakers**

There are plenty of good looking sneakers that aren't plimsolls. What you're looking for is minimal branding, burgundy, and blue coming in next. You can wear most sneakers with jeans, shorts, or even chinos.

* [Vans Chukkas](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/category/chukkas.html) Vans chukkas are great: No branding, and many colors. My favorites are the grays and tans. Avoid wearing shorts with these.

* [Adidas Campus](http://www.adidas.com/us/product/mens-originals-campus-2-suede-shoes/07245) These are widely regarded as a good shoe, but sambas are leather instead of suede.

* [New Balance 501](http://www.newbalance.com/New-Balance-501/ML501,default,pd.html?dwvar_U420_color=Blue_with_White_and_Black&amp;start=19&amp;cgid=106000) New balances are in many people's opinions unattractive, but honestly they're pretty decent and few shoes have the same feel to them.

* [Nike Free Runs](http://www.footlocker.com/product/model:175362/sku:10642600/nike-free-run-+-3-mens/red/grey/?cm=TnDdMensRun) and [Nike Roshe Runs](http://dimeadozenclothing.com/staff/wp-content/uploads/Nike-Roshe-Run1.jpg) Nike Runs come in many different styles, so if you're looking for something interesting these are a great choice. The Roshe Runs look awesome too, they're more simple than most of the Frees.

* [Nike Janoskis](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/product/stefan-janoski-premium-id-skateboarding-shoe/) These are great and commonly recommended too. The customization feature is a nice touch.

**Espadrilles**

Espadrilles are a moderately common style of shoe, except because they have no laces they are almost sandal like. [Toms](http://images.toms.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/side/900x640/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/w/-/w-ash-canvas-classics-s-su12_1.jpg) are a great example of Espadrilles, however toms are overpriced. Because of their inexpensiveness, Espadrilles are great for more 'throwaway' looks: Interesting patterns, prints, and designs. Espadrilles are perfect for shorts. Neutral colors such as cream, white, but so are some bright colors(turquoise

* [soludos](http://www.soludos.com/shop-men) These look pretty solid

* [Asos](http://us.asos.com/Men/Shoes-Boots-Trainers/Espadrilles/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=11246&amp;r=1&amp;mk=VOID) These are cheap as all fuck

* [Drilley's](http://drilleys.com/mens_espadrilles.aspx) A few of these have a grunge vibe that I'm not a fan of, which is too expensive if you ask me.
**Hi-Tops**

Hi-Tops are a style of shoe that I don't have experience with. However, and many are fond of getting white hi-tops and then beating the shit out of them so they have a worn out feel. Hi-Tops work best with jeans, and don't work well with shorts.

* [Nike Basketball Shoes](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?l=shop, so try to pick out the more subdued ones(but don't be afraid of interesting colors, that's what makes some of these really work). [This Hyperfuse](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?l=shop,pdp,ctr-inline/cid-100701/pid-670699/pgid-727750) is a great example of one that has some color going on, but isn't too noisy. That said, it's not a real versatile shoe because of the red and black color scheme.

* [Nike Air Jordans](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/product/air-jordan-2012-id-basketball-shoe/) Air Jordans are a classic basketball shoe. You can customize them on the Nike site(although they'll be cheaper found elsewhere; more on that later) and they're fairly simple. There are tons of models throughout the years

* [Nike Dunks](http://www.nike.com/nikedunk/index.jhtml#l=chronicles&amp;co=US&amp;la=en) are another great hi-top.

* [Nike Blazers](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/product/blazer-mid-id-shoe/) These are my personal favorite out of the few I've mentioned. They're very simple

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15mtml/top_5_jordans/) a great thread about air jordans on MFA.

**Bucks**
[Bucks](http://www.valetmag.com/gr/daily/style/profiles_features/outlook_spring10/art-week4_bucks8.jpg) are great casual, except [bucks](http://www.valetmag.com/gr/daily/style/profiles_features/outlook_spring10/art-week4_bucks8.jpg) have a slightly different shape and are suede or nubuck instead of leather. Most brand name bucks are $100+, so you'll want to grab them at a thrift store, ebay, or amazon. Wear bucks with shorts(sockless) or longpants.

* Running shoes are for running and the gym and basketball shoes are for basketball also the same with most skate shoes so keep it that way.

* Cargo shorts are almost always a NO

* If you're wearing baggy jeans they look bad. I'm sorry they do at least wear a straight cut. Tapered look best.

* You're not a walking billboard get rid of the brand names across your chest.

If seeking advice on an outfit

* A picture is essential. Take a picture of you wearing your entire outfit (yes

* Include your dimensions.

* List the items you are wearing. If the picture is low quality

* Explain your personal fit preferences (slim

**Ivy League**

*Description:* The Ivy League look is something I sport fairly often because of how it walks that line between formal and informal. The Ivy League (also referred too as Ivy Style by some) look is very classy and simple. It originated in the '50s on college campuses across America. JFK was a total boss at Ivy League style back in his day. It compliments those with a average or athletic build but

*Examples of Ivy League looks:*

* [His sweater is bulgy in the back but this guy is doing it right.](http://www.ivy-style.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/68.jpg)

* [I don't like some of the outfits in this photo but classic Ivy examples.](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AD942_ivyjum_DV_20110203232219.jpg)

*How to pull it off:* There's different ways to pull off a Ivy League look but I'll just cover my favorite. Let's face it

This outfit consists of a white or [light-colored](http://www.express.com/1mx-extra-slim-fit-french-cuff-shirt-42466-800/control/page/3/show/3/index.pro) dress shirt (fitted preferably), and then a pair of brown [penny loafers](http://www.shoebuy.com/allen-edmonds-kenwood/438290/932500) or similar (I wear [these](http://www.dockersshoes.com/p/44982/c/22/BASTILLE-Red-Brown.aspx)) with a matching brown belt.

Keep in mind most persons sporting the Ivy League look have clean-cut hair and face.

**Street Style**

*Description:* Street Style is literally defined as any offbeat or avant-garde fashion inspired by contemporary culture of urban street people. Street Style is awesome because it can be *anything* and it's very flexible. It varies from city-to-city and can range from lots of bright colors to really dark

*Examples:* 

* [GQ has some great examples of street styles throughout America.](http://www.gq.com/style/street-style)

* [My favorite street-style outfits \(GQ slideshow\).](http://www.gq.com/style/street-style/201106/tommy-ton-polo-classic#slide=1)

*How to pull it off:* Street-style is what you make it. I don't often wear outfits referred too as street-style

To pull of street-style, people need to go ""that person is dressed so awesome that it actually makes me feel a bit awkward"". Here's what I do: I throw on a striped [dress shirt](http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10901&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=87663&amp;parentCategoryId=87658&amp;topCategoryId=12202&amp;productId=893365&amp;seq=03) with a [striped green tie](http://www.amazon.com/Woven-Clover-Green-Striped-Skinny/dp/B002VATKRG/ref=sr_1_40?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329536014&amp;sr=1-40), [slim khakis](http://us.dockers.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12637546&amp;cp=2271557.2271567.3015280&amp;parentPage=family), a [shawl-collared gray cardigan](http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theorion.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/9f/89f4af96-1a48-11e1-8d95-0019bb30f31a/4ed469695a45a.preview-300.jpg), brown shoes with a matching belt, and a pair of silver mirrored aviators. That's pretty fly in my neck of the woods and I'm like a gaze magnet with that on. Keep in mind that most people in street style look awkward.

**V-neck and Denim**

*Description:* Many people are against wearing v-neck tees because of that hipster aura that surrounds them. In reality though, if you're a slim build, try the tee in-store before purchasing (but that goes for most clothing anyways). Wearing a v-neck tee and a pair of denim is a clean, date-night outfit for near any occasion.

*Examples:*

* [Red tee and dark denim](https://www.jackthreads.com/data/products/supersize_SamuraiVNeckTeeRedA.jpg)

* [Dark blue and dark denim](http://images.saksfifthavenue.com/images/products/04/264/2624/0426426246059/0426426246059R_300x400.jpg)

* [Athletic v-cut and denim](http://0.tqn.com/d/mensfashion/1/0/C/-/1/_5896425.jpg)

*How to pull it off:* This is a really easy one. All you need is a solid [v-neck tee](http://www.freshpair.com/Calvin-Klein-Micro-Modal-Short-Sleeve-V-Neck-T-Shirt-U5563.html) (use best judgement on deciding the color) and a pair of slim

**TOPS**

a staple in any wardrobe is t-shirts

[topman](http://www.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogNavigationSearchResultCmd?catalogId=33056&amp;storeId=12555&amp;langId=-1&amp;viewAllFlag=false&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=207191&amp;parent_categoryId=207169&amp;beginIndex=1&amp;pageSize=20) coming in at 2 for £12, navy and a colour you like. [£24]

once you have t shirts you'll probably wan't a few button downs

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/Men/Shirts/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=3602&amp;via=top) their own brand OCBD's roll in at around £22 a pop so are not too bad

to keep you warm on top of all your new shirts you're going to need a hoody or sweater

[topman](http://www.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogNavigationSearchResultCmd?catalogId=33056&amp;storeId=12555&amp;langId=-1&amp;viewAllFlag=false&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=207226&amp;parent_categoryId=207169&amp;beginIndex=1&amp;pageSize=200&amp;refinements=category~[207227|207226]&amp;noOfRefinements=1) there are a load of different colours

for the sweater I'd probably go with a plain grey crew neck. 

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Bound-Crew-Neck-Jumper/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1884403&amp;cid=7617&amp;Rf-400=53&amp;Rf-200=16&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Greymarl) something like this would do just fine

now to keep you extra toasty on those cold winter nights you need a coat

[UNIQLO](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/072931) mountain parker

**TROUSERS**

first off you're going to need a sick pair of jawnz

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/Men/Jeans/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=4208&amp;via=top#state=Rf-400%3D53&amp;parentID=Rf-400&amp;pge=0&amp;pgeSize=20&amp;sort=-1) own brand rolls in at around £25

then you're going to need some chinos

[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/Men/Trousers-Chinos/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=4910&amp;via=top#state=Rf-400%3D53&amp;parentID=Rf-400&amp;pge=0&amp;pgeSize=20&amp;sort=-1) own brand again rolls in at £25. if you're getting 2 colours for autumn my be is on a khaki and an [olive](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Skinny-Chino/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2026669&amp;cid=4910&amp;Rf-400=53&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Grey) pair

**SHOES**

in this we're going to get 2 pairs

[nike blazers](http://www.endclothing.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=nike+blazers&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) i think they look cool as shit

for something a little more 'classy'? we're going with desert boots

[topman](http://www.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;catalogId=33056&amp;storeId=12555&amp;productId=5737490&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=&amp;searchTerm=desert%20boots&amp;pageSize=20) i saw them in store they look the same as CDB's

1370796199.0,1fzkhw,An Introduction to Online Shopping (International friendly),Arkyrie,23,0,10,"For people our age

**The good news:**
- You sit in your chair and shop. You don't even have to leave the house

- You want to shop at places that are out of your reach

- You want to shop styles and fashion that isn't normally stocked in your area/country

- There are almost ALWAYS sales that appear online. Each online store will have a ""SALE"" section

- Delivered straight to your doorstep

**The bad:**
- Online stores are often based in different countries. An easy example is ASOS, which is based in the USA. 

- This means that shipping may sometimes be expensive, often $50.

- You can't try any of the clothes on and see how they fit

- Delivery can take a while

- It is definitely not the same as actually shopping for clothes

- You need a debit/credit card to pay for your purchases

**PAYMENT**

A number of different possibilities were outlined to me below:

- You can use a debit card. You can get one as young as 13 apparently

- You can buy a prepaid debit card from supermarkets (USA)

- You can ask older friends and relatives

- You will need a Paypal account often to make purchases.

**The websites:**
*[ASOS](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Shop-womens-fashion-mens-clothing-Free-Shipping-Returns/wtwin/?xr=1&amp;mk=na&amp;r=3):* ASOS is the stock standard in online shopping, and they offer sizes from XXS to XXL. Sales are on 24/7, with pop-up sales happening often. The site is based in England which offers very quick delivery if you live there, or quite efficient services if you live elsewhere.

Make use of their ""saved items"" feature to check if items go on sale or they get discounted even further. Stock does sometimes run out fairly quickly though

*[Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp):* Urban Outfitters offers clothing that is a little bit more 'indie', their clothing is still affordable and for Americans wanting to pick up a pair of Levi 511s and Dockers pants, it's a good place to shop. 

They have more name-brands than ASOS does, go for it. Remember that non-sale stock gets replaced, whereas once sale stock is gone, it's gone for good. 

*[Plndr/Karmaloop](http://www.plndr.com/):* Plndr is the place to go if you're looking for streetwear, T-shirts galore and jackets for less than $30. There are also lots of name-brand shoes on sale, including Vans and Creative Recreation. 

When you're shopping online on Plndr, there is no better place. Their 'buy one get one free' offers are also pretty good too.

*[eBay](http://www.ebay.com.au/):* Really only good if you know what you're doing, and be wary of buying from Chinese sellers. Hong Kong sellers are usually better, because Chinese sellers often do not have an option to track your package, which can get infuriating when it arrives a month later.

When searching, but with $20 dollars of shipping tacked onto it, may not seem so worth it any more. You'll need PayPal and an eBay account to buy from there.

*[Cotton On](http://us.cottonon.com/):* Cotton On is an Australian brand which does have a US and Asian online store as well. For America, since there are often little 'fire sales' where clothes are mysteriously discounted to a very cheap level a few times a year. 

For example, since the quality is fairly average. Slim fit trackies are worth buying, I personally love mine. The shoes are of a dubious quality, though.

*[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/):* Probably only good for you Americans out there. I've had no personal experience

This is just a very, and so far, I've found it's an easy way to replace your wardrobe without maximum effort. 

Just make sure you buy things of good quality (i.e. search online for brands/specific pieces that you know are good) and you protect yourself when buying and don't spend too much in one go. Use and abuse the sales

* **Colours**

Please, burgundies, and forest greens. All of examples are not choosen in Fall's colors. Decide which ones you want. The brown pallet of colors rules throughout the Fall.

are the most versatile colors. If the fall is colder take the Harrington jacket

* [Parka](http://shop.uniqlo.com/uk/goods/071562) - The example features UNIQLO's checked light cotton parka.

* [Hooded Jacket](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Fishermans-Jacket/xqeib/?iid=2046378&amp;amp;amp;cid=3606&amp;amp;amp;Rf914=3472, it's worth checking out, though.

* [Harrington Jacket](http://www.baracuta-g9.com/G9-Slim-Fit-Made-In-England/G9S043160/5051235838840/f) - This classic harrington jacket isn't cheap but the quality is top notch and they do have some discounts right now

* **Sweaters**


Again, burgandies, tans. The most casual piece of this section is a hoodie. The second one comes crew neck and the last or the most formal is V neck. Again, avoid over-branding

Jeans, they cost 70 pounds, it's regular fit and the quality is great. If possible avoid fake fades and holes, unless want an immature look. Avoid bright colors of chinos. Colors as always, go for brown, olive etc. If you're not a fan of cords or chinos you can always go for colored denim, moleskin

It's getting colder so put away your no-show socks and get warmer socks. Please note, Zara, Uniqlo, AA, etc.) and get woolen socks. Get yourself a scarf and a pair of gloves for windy and cold Fall days. If you're younger peer, definitely don't get leather gloves. Avoid synthetic scarf and instead get cashmere, silk and wool blends. Don't buy too thin scarf

* **Caps**

As with everything, orange hat with a badge at its bottom. It should keep your head warm and happy during the coldest Fall's days. The second one is more safe, two color variations on this one and that's burgundy/cream and navy/burgundy. Two horizontal stripes run across the bottom of this cap. Again, happy and warm head. The last one is an acrylic hat, it should provide solid protection against cold  and windy days.

[Merona 3 pack V Neck tees](http://www.target.com/p/merona-men-s-3pack-v-neck-tee-white/-/A-12279245#?lnk=sc_qi_detaillink)

These fit slim and are great shirts that can replaced for cheap.

Raglans like this come in and out of fashion often. I recommend this shirt in both red/white and blue/grey. They're nice shirts and also easily replaceable. 

2x [Land's End Canvas Chambray Shirt](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-guildsman-chambray-workshirt~235398_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::UG8&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_men-_-shirts-&amp;origin=index)

This is your basic sweatshirt. I recommend the red or blue colors.

OR

[American Apparel Zip-Up Sweatshirt](http://store.americanapparel.net/f497.html)

Also a basic sweatshirt for those who don't like the speckled look. 
 
**Pants:**

 **Shoes**

[Vans Canvas Authentic](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/41$.html?categoryId=10147&amp;colorCode=QER6LS#variation-2)

OR

[Vans Canvas Era](http://shop.vans.com/catalog/Vans/en_US/style/53$.html?vcategoryId=PDPZ1&amp;cm_vc=PDPZ1#variation-3)

First of all, and they're polarized. 

[Chambray](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-chambray-long-sleeve-shirt/075397-65-006). If you don't already know

[Linen checks](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-premium-linen-check-long-sleeve-shirt/076329001-65-004). Once again

Stripes. Personally, something that lacks stripes towards the top such as [these](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-washed-pique-striped-short-sleeve-polo-shirt/071231-69-006). 

Striped T-shirts are also nice during the summer. I have a firm belief that the look requires it to be a pocket-tee for stripes, just go to target. Avoid more than 3 colors of stripes, and stick to basic neutral colors for a base for the most part. 

I don't care who says it's okay to wear cargo shorts. If you wear them, J. Crew is having a sale on all their shorts right now, but once again, you will spend more. 

The short-sleeve henley! Quite possibly the closest thing you can get to not wearing a shirt in the spring (other than tank tops

Espadrilles are a great alternative to barefoot (if that's your thing). [Soludos](http://www.soludos.com/shop-men) is the only way to go

Some side notes to add are that you probably own a pair of Vans and probably are going to not wear socks. Pick up some of [these](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/accessories/socks/PRDOVR~10089/10089.jsp) bad boys so your shoes don't smell like your room probably does. 

Accessories are also very valuable during these seasons as they stand out more with less fabric on. If you have a watch

Backpacks are great to have during these next two seasons. They offer chances to pack all your shit in places you would have kept in your extra cargo pockets. Sign up over at [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/) and get a decent pack.

1357672722.0,1675lc,Spring/Summer thread/guide/whatever,,21,4,54,"For those of us in constantly changing climates (re: texas) we have to change our dress according to the weather. I won't ignore the fact that there's [already a spring and summer guide for teens](http://redd.it/pq1m2) but i will add on to what i believe it missed out on.

**Shirts**

Your summer shirts should consist of lightweight shirts such as linen. Cotton,[ocbd](http://i.imgur.com/4kOP2.jpg),[polos](http://i.imgur.com/CMn5l.jpg) and even [chambray](http://i.imgur.com/YnNjY.jpg) or [denim shirts](http://i.imgur.com/m3GPh.jpg). As far as color goes, you want to keep the colors to a lighter range of hues. Almost like a pastel shade. [Whites](http://i.imgur.com/1AQBq.jpg), [light pinks](http://i.imgur.com/TlCB0.jpg), [light blues](http://i.imgur.com/Tbyzo.jpg), yellow, gingham, [weird stuff](http://www.unionmadegoods.com/gitman_vintage_Girl_Camp_2_Button_Down_7878.html))

-Tanktops. If it's super hot and a t-shirt is too much

**Bottoms**

If you were like me, [raw denim](http://i.imgur.com/NmD9YgO.jpg) (if you can stand it), or even [cropped] [pants](http://im.uniqlo.com/images/us/pc/goods/072040/sub/072040_sub2.jpg). But if you're like the new me, and shorts *are * your thing, here's some advice to keep in mind: Keep your short's length on or above the knee. Anything else looks baggy or just unflattering. [Short short](http://i.imgur.com/42JeV.jpg)s are cool, but expect to be called out on it. Gotta have the confidence to rock em. Get your shorts in versatile colors like [khaki](http://i.imgur.com/iwpp8.jpg), [navy](http://i.imgur.com/4kOP2.jpg), mint

**Shoes**

Aah shoes. My favorite subject. I absolutely love almost all my shoes in summer. As mentioned in the other guide, [vans](http://i.imgur.com/Cgivp.jpg) or keds in colors like [white](http://i.imgur.com/uJvU8.jpg), navy, or [ maroon.](http://i.imgur.com/c4enJ.jpg) Add [leather laces](http://imgur.com/a/1XQaG) if you'd like. Looks cool bro. You can pick up a pair of [camo](http://i.imgur.com/hYqTlh.jpg) plimsolls as mentioned last summer. Boat shoes are super easy to rock, but avoid wearing them with pants as I feel it looks try-hard. Get some in oatmeal [sahara](http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-sahara) [dark brown](http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-classic-brown) or navy. **Avoid the vans/boat shoe hybrid.** *Yuck.* Other types of shoes to wear in summer is [penny loafers](http://i.imgur.com/jcFbQ.jpg),[white bucks](http://i.imgur.com/ltp7g.jpg), [longwings](http://i.imgur.com/aLjPY.jpg)(I know those aren't longwings but you get the idea)

Limit flip flops to the beach.


**Hats**. I don't like them. At all. So I never bothered to learn the rules about them. If you must read about them
&gt;As you're a teenager you can still make flat brim caps look good

**Accessories** If you feel the need to wear something other than pants, but not recommended. 

**Sunglasses** I recommend getting a cheap pair of [wayfayers](http://i.imgur.com/6SaYK.jpg) or [clubmasters](http://i.imgur.com/e3KOK.jpg) on amazon. They're cheap and if they break

My [iCloud Inspiration Album](https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#A4532ODWGbphC2) has lots of summer looks as well as fall and winter looks. You can check there if you'd like.

1359065927.0,177svo,Backpack Guide ,,22,7,47,"Someone asked for it so here we go.

Backpacks are easily the most used item in your wardrobe. The best part is that they are like bonus questions on a quiz, fine aesthetics and convenient. 

**Things to avoid**
 
* Roller backpacks - They make you look 5. Please don't do this. I'm sure if you're subscribed to this sub-reddit
   
* [Pull String Bags](http://www.pinupbags.com.au/Backpacks/gym_pack.jpg) - These will almost always not give you enough room for your things
  
* [Mesh/See through](http://assets.academy.com/mgen/10/10043910.jpg?is=500
 
* [Swiss Army Bags](http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/500/10393071.jpg) -These are like the cargo shorts of backpacks. You think you can go to school with this because it has pockets for everything
  
* [neon](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8xlm6CMLU1qm11a2o1_500.jpg) -Far too flashy and bright for any outfit or blending into highschool/middleschool. They look quite feminine as well.
  
* Drawing/writing all over your bag. - Looks childish, but c'mon)
  
* Messenger bags - Not easy to run to class/bike to school with. Hard to keep everything together. Acceptable if you have a laptop


**OKAY THE ACTUAL INFORMATION PART OF THE GUIDE HERE WE GO okay**

Sleek bags are awesome.  A safe option is to go for backpacks like 
 
* [Herschel Pop Quiz Backpack](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=22634638&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [Rucksack inspired bags like Herschel Little America Backpack](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=22634752&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [The ones with the leather patch
  
* [Simple
  
* [Simple Textbook backpacks. O'Hanlon Mills Textbook Backpack](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=24446429&amp;parentid=MENS_ACCESSORIES)
  
* [Prints

* [Everlane's bags are super cool](http://i.imgur.com/dcWjq.jpg) (I mean both the regular back and the snap backpack.)
  

Your backpack should be enough to fit your school supplies, (even without the jacket) then it's too small.

3. There are many teens who wear nice slim fit pants/jeans but there are few that I have seen that can pull of nice shorts. So my advice for shorts is that you wear something that is similar to chino flat front shorts.

Only problem is that my wardrobe is still pretty lousy. Baggy clothes, etc. I've been reading through some things and was wondering what would make me look good. Keep in mind I'm 15, so I don't want to come off as pretentious at school or anything. I just want to look neat and like I know what I'm doing.

So, simple patterns, v-necks, and button-ups? What else? Also, what about pants? I've pretty much been exclusively wearing jeans. Different shades and everything, but just jeans. Is that alright or should I be looking for something else as well?

And when it comes to shoes I'm a bit lost too. Would something like this be alright?

1358194389.0,16kipb,Raw Denim Guide,teflonpepe,13,6,15,"This is a short and hopefully helpful guide to raw denim.
 
 
**What Is Raw Denim**
    
Raw denim explained in the simplest explanation is denim that has not went through the washing process when being manufactured. The washing process is to shrink the denim to prevent later shrinkage. It also helps to soften the material. This is why raw denim is very stiff and it is encouraged that you soak before wearing it.
 

 
**Other Stuff About Raw Denim**

* Materials- Usually raw denim is 100% cotton. The cotton's country of origin varies(Japanese).

* Fit- The fit of the pants will vary with the brands. Most brands have a wide range of different types of fits.

* Weight- The weight is called denim weight. The weight of the denim is measured in ounces. There are three categories of weight: Light, Medium is 12-16 oz, and Heavy is 16 oz and up.  

* Selvedge- This is something you might not notice at first but is a really nice addition to you denim. Selvedge denim forms a clean natural edge on the out-seam.
 
 
 
Now after reading all this text you're probably wondering why the hell you should care about if your denim is raw or not.
 
***This is why.***
 
* Raw denim is a great value. Because of the weight of the denim and not being washed nearly as often as washed denim you are able to wear it for an extremely long amount of time. Your jeans slowly become a part of you as you wear them

* Your jeans become apart of you! As you wear them fades
 
 
 
***Brands***
There are tons of brands that make raw denim, 3sixteen, A.P.C., Flat Head, Iron Heart, Unbranded(Made by N&amp;F), and Samurai.
    There is also multiple places that you can purchase raw denim. With a quick Google search you can find online shops that sell most of these brands.

I'm going into my senior year of HS and I've never once considered fashion. I'm looking for ways to improve what has come to  be my ""trademark"" (probably in the bad sense) look. Sorry for the wall of text.

I'm 6'3 and weigh 130, running shoes, some sort of colorful, nerdy shirt, and a Patagonia better sweater ([pic](http://www.surfstitch.com/product_images/25526STH-PATAGONIA-1.JPG)). I know, I'm sorry. As of now, I have 4 pairs of grey slacks and probably around 6 Patagonia sweaters of different varieties. 

I rather like the whole shirt and slacks thing - it seems to fit my frame well - but I definitely want to find the way to make it look better. I'm open to any changes in shoes (size 14 in nearly everything), shirt brands, coats, whatever. Wow, I've realized the shoes are really, really bad. They're bright green running shoes and I don't run.

The main two things I'm looking for are:  

*A source of good quality

*A coat, likely). I really like Sherlock's coat ([pic1](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5hIrmjR9WRc/TuNeNOrOCjI/AAAAAAAAAtc/LECljgGROQ8/s1600/1069291-low_res-sherlock.jpg), [pic2](http://www.fhm.com/App_Media/Uploads/Images/Original/image/sherlock-coat-main.jpg), [pic3](http://www.dorkadore.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Sherlock_Holmes_coat.jpg)), but  I've had no luck in finding something similar to fit me that doesn't look quite so... stark.

1343488116.0,xasxb,A TeenMFA Guide to Dressing in Autumn.,AnonymousTeenMFA,8,1,3,"Hey TeenMFA. I guess you could say Autumn is about a month away, but you have to understand that Fall is one of the most expensive seasons to shop in


**First off: Colours!**


As a general rule, and forest greens will be preferable to, say, lime. You’ll also want to try and incorporate more browns, creams especially, and bring in gray as well.


General advice on Autumn:


Autumn isn’t a time to flaunt your fashionista self. It isn’t a time to wear deep pink v-necks and exotic colour combinations with weird accessories. You want to stay modest yet sophisticated and feel natural in the environment and climate. Autumn is also all about layers. Both practically and fashionably. Blend your chocolates

So let’s get started shall we?




**Bottom layer:**


-Your bottom layer like most days, or [peppered shirts](
http://www.hm.com/us/product/92433?article=92433-V#article=92433-T) as they work with a less vivid



-Buttoned shirts also work if you want to find a medium between a sweatshirt/sweater and t shirt. Remember to always get a long-sleeve in the fall/winter, sweatshirts, and coats will mostly be solid, a [checkered button long sleeve](http://www.hm.com/us/product/00922?article=00922-A#article=00922-B) will go a long way. [Alternative](http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product/us/en/zara-us-S2012-s/244945/629542/RAGLAN%2BSLEEVE%2BSHIRT)




**Middle layer:**



-For the majority of cases, but by no means rule them out if YOU think you can pull it off. Patterns are going to be hard to find for your middle layer, so try to make up for it in fabric and texture if you feel like your outfit is feeling a bit flat. However [cotton crewneck pullover sweaters](http://www.clubmonaco.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12473698) are great for almost all occasions.

[Option](http://www.hm.com/us/product/01538?article=01538-C)
[Option](http://store.americanapparel.net/mt497.html?c=Peppered%20Cranberry)



**Outerwear:** 



-In a sense, and there is nothing like owning a quality, good looking coat that will last you forever. Adults can wear a piece of outerwear for 15+ years. Generally, I like to go for*waxed cotton, since it’s versatile, comes in a lot of styles, and is relatively easy to pull off. Just be careful of too many pockets, but make sure it still fits. Stay away from trenches and leather, but it works. Finally
 Let me say this again

[$100](http://www.landsend.com/pp/mens-insulated-stormer-jacket~232322_59.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::VNO&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_men-_-outerwear)

[$220](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_feature/NewArrivals/outerwear/PRDOVR~96051/96051.jsp)



**Pantalons:**




-Shorts are out of the question
) in a darker wash. Also note, and sorry to state the obvious, but jeans will never, ever, ever go out of style or season so it’s money well spent.

-[Chinos](http://www.hm.com/us/product/98847?article=98847-C) are also a safe bet

-I’m also personally a big fan of what H&amp;M calls [“pants”](http://www.hm.com/us/product/92068?article=92068-A#article=92068-D). (Go figure.) But they seem to be a jean style slim pant that come in a variety of colours. Try out a grey or chocolate colour to get something that still works great



**Shoes and other:**



-To be honest, the plain tee of the shirt realm, and the white rice of the Asian food realm. You can never go wrong. However, like the rest of your outfit, don’t try anything too bold. Try out the [OTW](
http://www.vans.com/microsites/otw/ludlow.php) set from Vans

-A watch really pulls together an outfit. Try and find something with a leather strap. If you dress with the clothes I’ve shown above, and a leather strap. It shouldn’t be hard, but bonus points for one with gold accents (gold works great in Autumn, but unfortunately for teens its hard to incorporate)

-Belts for jeans should just stay leather, and a darker leather is preferred over a lighter.

-Finally if you have a little extra dough to blow, but nothing compares to trying them yourself. Remember to NEVER over apply, you will be walking around school with hundreds of other people, you don’t want to be known as THAT guy. Once on the wrist, and once on the neck about 30 minutes before school, you want the ladies to discover it with a hug or over a coffee, not alert them of your presence.

**Closing comments:**

I’m not saying go BUY all these clothes. It’s expensive, t shirts, and a coat, but the rest you can really work into your outfit, even if you don’t have the ideal ingredients, and in many cases it could turn out better then what I have here. Anyway, I hope someone can take something useful from this, so TeenMFA gurus

The jacket seems nice and light

Another consideration is to just get a hoodie like everyone else. I have nothing against them

My last thought was to get some kind of mega ordinary windbreaker like this:
 http://www.thebay.com/eng/mens-outerwear-Zip_Front_Rain_Jacket-thebay/249205

   A leather jacket will definitely not work. Things like peacoats and wool jackets look kinda cool, most track jackets I've seen on others look kind of tacky.

Any opinions or ideas?

I've been here for about an hour and this is my first post
Next January, one of their videos appeared on the front page a few days ago. So this is serious business.

I'll be 16 then, and I'm not sure how they expect me to dress there. I'm inexperienced in dressing well, I only have experience in casual wear. I'm also on a slight budget...

The reason I'm asking now is because I'll be in the US the next few weeks, otherwise the wizards of MFA might be able to help.

I can post a pic of myself if needed

I’m a short and skinny male and I need some help and advice on finding me the right fit for me. I usually wear Levi’s 511 jeans found in the children’s section of the department store; 28W &amp; 28L. Unfortunately for me, no pun intended, compared to the men’s section. They only come in about three different colors, and yes you bet, I have all three of those colors as compared to the dozens of colors offered in the men’s section.

The men’s section of Levi’s in the department stores only come in at the minimum 29W &amp; 30L. Unfortunately for me

I apologize if this sounds a bit confusing but it's kind of frustrating looking for jeans before school begins near the end of the month. Thanks for your help.

Anyway... I've been lurking around here and other male fashion subreddits for a little while, or if it's a paper-thin see-through white t-shirt and you're letting too much show. But what's wrong with matching a plain t-shirt with a casual shirt and making it part of your outfit? Or letting about an inch of white stick out over the top of your polo? Sometimes I like to wear plaid button-ups with a v-neck of a coordinating color underneath, with the top two or three buttons open. I think just so long as your undershirt isn't hanging out past the bottom of your outer shirt, and you don't leave too many buttons undone, it looks nice.

Like your creepy neighbor Tom from across the street, and brought to tears of both joy and disgust many times. I will also say that I’ve learned a hell of a lot from some of the posts and comments on the sub-reddit. Most of you are quite apt when it comes selecting bodily linens. However

General Observations/Thoughts

Unfortunately

When it comes to clothing

Branding

I generally hate branding, and downright ugly while the other is classy and well made. Don’t flaunt your brands, but wear them with a subdued sense of pride.

Ideas That Will Probably Piss You Off

I don’t like jeans as everyday casual wear. Jeans were invented as work pants, don’t have jeans as your default pants choice. I challenge you to be different. 

Shoes

I think Vans and Nike sneakers are just fine and dandy for the younger teens on this page. However, we can probably get away with wearing a pair with a coat and tie. I recommend Sperrys. They are the original boat shoe, and most of the other brands come across as pretty copy-caty. Go with any shade of brown. They are just as affordable as any flashy, branded up Nike shoe, and they get better with age. They can be worn with no socks, but I personally like to match them white Nike mid-calves. Never wear dark socks with them. You will meet people who strongly oppose socks with Sperrys, but I think they provide a youthful twist to a timeless classic. I can’t push the Sperrys enough. Buy ‘em.

Ever heard of Bean Boots? They are great for the snow and rain and they look damn good too. They’ll last forever and the come from a great company with awesome customer service. Check them out.

Now I have to weigh in on desert boots/chukkas/others-of-the-sort

Closing remarks

Wow, and stay classy, TeenMFA.
