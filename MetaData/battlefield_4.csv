1371228915.0,1gcj48,To DICE: Please implement a Shooting-Range in BF4,kostroma,618,76,119,"Now that practicing modes for air vehicles have been confirmed it would be really nice if there also was a shooting-range on which we could try out new guns and attachment combinations before diving into real multiplayer. 

I feel like a lot of weapons are neglected in BF3 because it's hard to adapt to a new gun if you're constantly get stomped on while trying to get used to new properties like recoil patterns, damage and time to kill. Some people just get frustrated with ""ruining their stats"" and stick to their beloved M16 or AEK. 

Same reasoning goes for fps noobs who can learn and experiment with different firing techniques other than spray and pray 

While older titles included things like offline bot-matches or onslaught which were great for this purpose it is understandable that a full fledged AI and a working offline mode can't be made with all the other tasks on schedule this close to release. But a shooting-range satisfying some basic properties should be feasible: 


___________________________________________________________ 

• The shooting-range should be accessible for all players of BF4 without having the need to rent a server to host it on. (something like an offline map) 

• All (unlocked) multiplayer weapons + attachments should be accessible. (simply include the spawn menu from the multiplayer) 

• All weapons should have their exact multiplayer stats in terms of dmg

• The shooting-range targets should be spottable and take the same dmg as players in SC/HC (let us select our preferred mode before launching the shooting-range) 

• Build a map in the spirit if of Ghost Recon (→ http://youtu.be/emjQSpMEezc?t=1m11s  http://youtu.be/3QTEgc7JWmA?t=10m17s ←) including still targets, different distances and a unlimited supply of ammo and explosives for the player 

• It doesn't have to be fancy

My name is Daniel Lingen, as well as our segment host Lisa Malambri. Finally, a HUGE thanks goes out to all of the DICE developers and community streamers that made guest appearances on the stream. Not only were they a great source of information, they were the ones who got the code to where it is today - rock solid and ready to be streamed to the millions of fans watching at home. 

Now that we've spent the weekend recovering from what can only be described as an awesome E3

Corey, Twitter, and Facebook during the live stream. We did our best to get your questions covered and confirm / deny anything that we could. We also sent on your positive vibes to the team back in Stockholm, and let everybody running the booth know you were watching. 

We also spent a great deal of time in the Twitch.TV/Battlefield chat trying to get questions answered there too. 

Beyond this, and for that I am grateful.

it was no problem on BC games as we got used to it fast and we used to have an idea what dose it mean form experience and situations we are in.

or at least give us the option to switch it on or off like BC.

on the other hand can we please get a separate voice actors for each role just like we used to in BC

like for example the Russian engineer voice actor in BC2

all the voice actors in BC were great

who agrees with me ?

I'll explain by epic scenario analysis:
      
Your main weapon is out of ammo. You hit reload button. Animation begins. Empty mag is dropped. Wild enemy appears during animation. Quick switch to pistol and kill enemy. After switching back to your main weapon

Incorporating some sort of reload memory system is something that can only make the gameplay of BF4 smoother and more realistic without taking away from the fun aspect of the game at all. I don't know if something like this would be easy to add or not

Does anyone else know what I'm talking about? Am I making any sense?

I didn't record it in action due to the NDA but this screenshot from the already revealed leaked alpha stuff some time ago shows somewhat of the proof http://www.ea.charlieintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RVK3YsXh-610x400.jpg

Now the image looks pretty ordinary, out of bounds timer etc etc) yet in an empty server I began taking damage. I notice the AA had started to shoot me, the out of bounds timer got to me before it did but on confirmation of hitting TAB the server was absolutely empty. Hence an AI controlled AA defense, from what I gather is when a human is not inside the AA a computer AI defends the base on its own.

Now this very well maybe just a thing within the alpha to get people out in the action rather than messing with the base AA but what are your thoughts if this were to be implemented into the main game? Great way to prevent vehicle left and spawn rape? Or another hand holding mechanic that shouldn't have to be put in the game?

I personally love it

Just thought you guys would like to know


Edit: Apparently I started a bunch of shit with at least one person. I want to be clear

I would also like to point out, so the Battlepickups could have already been removed, they could be triggered by the commander, etc. Things are still changing so take this info with a grain of salt. 

I can confirm that there are three locations. One at B, marked by a similar logo to the med/ammo packs on the ground in BF3, except the bullets and medical cross logos are now an M9. B flag contains the MGL. This is the area at the beginning of the multiplayer trailer where they drop the tank through the ground after shooting a pillar out. It seems it is placed there to allow any class to potentially drop the tank through the ground, although it is not limited to this. The M82 was on top of the skyscraper at C flag. Obviously a good vantage point. And, there was one at D but I didn't get to see what it said or grab it, but it contained a ""GL"" in it and had a current BF3 M320 logo. The only restrictions I noticed on the weapons was that they couldn't be resupplied.

I started noticing them towards the end of yesterday's alpha session. The alpha closed before I could get back and see what the D flag one was exactly. Which I will post back.



EDIT 2: They appear after a flag is captured.

Here is why...,RicardoCasco,161,35,104,"Battlefield 4 is looking really good so far. A lot of features that were taken out when Bad Company came into play are coming back. Mainly features people had wanted for the past few years like Commander mode

However there is still one problem we're seeing that most will tend to overlook. That is **Map Design**.

Battlefield claims to want to be a teamwork based open world. However we've been seeing a lot of very small cluttered maps

Note that small cluttered maps aren't terrible

*This really all aims down to one main point. TLDR at the bottom.* 


**What BF4 needs to include with maps is:**

^^*Green* ^^*lines* ^^*are* ^^*routes* ^^*you* ^^*can* ^^take ^^*via* ^^*foot.*

1. **More openly spaced out flags** : Here we have Firestorm. As you can see the actual playing area is merely a small rectangle within the flags on a ""large map"" that have been pushed together with mostly open spaces. Still a fun map, roads, buildings and even amount of open areas for every type of fighting that way you could play the map more than one round and not be bored by repetitiveness. 

2. **More flanking routes** : Here we see the preview of Shanghai on the commander mode. The map looks great, there really isn't much. And compare it to Zatar wetlands which allows many ways of taking an objective and going around the enemy. [IMAGE](http://4st.me/EaLwN.png) 

3. **More streets and roads for urban maps** : Maps like Grand Bazaar tend to be a mess of grenades and pointless combat

Looking forward to how BF4 turns out

It doesn't make sense that even though I am in the same tank as another player on my team I cannot talk to them or issue commands. I might be assaulting a flag stealthily with another player but I am not easily able to let him know to keep quiet so we can flank.

I propose that some sort of proximity chat be introduced into the game. When you speak in the game everyone within a 10 foot radius should be able to hear you

Adding voice distortion or radio static to the in-game voices could really increase immersion and make it feel like you are part of a living breathing battlefield. I wouldn't think this proximity voice chat would be too difficult to implement either

What are your thoughts on this?

There are a few things they needs to do in regards to the Commo-Rose in order for it to be effective

* Add a text-feed for all of the call-outs. It's otherwise useless on the China/Russia side since you can't understand what people are asking for and it's going to get drowned out by radio chatter on the US side.

* Make the name of the player flash above his soldier. It helps you identify the player who made the call-out on your screen.

* Make the player flash on the map as well.

All of this stuff was present in... Battlefield 2/2142

The text-feed could either be a separate window or integrated into the chatbox. Since we now have audio that actually calls out the direction your enemy

* Enemy tank
* Enemy machine-gunner

#Now in regards to the chat-box... I honestly believe BC2 had the best chatbox out of the entire series. It was simple and intuitive

1375493741.0,1jlpce,!Suppression should prevent squad spawning,bases_loaded,97,31,20,"I've always felt this is an ideal way to use suppression. You and your squad are hunting part of an enemy squad which is badly hurt

If implemented


Suppression (at least that stops squad spawning) should be for support only

* This gives the support a powerful tool that makes the use of the class more focused
* I think this would also provide better balance for the classes since recon has C4


A support should have to fire 10-15 bullets to stop squad spawning. 

* This makes sure that suppression is intentional
* Also prevents suppression spamming over many targets


Suppression should decay rapidly after fire stops

* Also prevents spamming suppression
* Creates a time limit for suppression which is related to the size of the support's magazine
* I think it would be really annoying if it weren't the case


There should be a clear visual indicator that lets a person know when they are 'nearing suppression' and when they are suppressed.

* Nearing suppression could be the same blurry effect
* Suppressed could maybe be an abrupt loss of color or darkening of the edges of the screen
* This takes away potential frustration of 'Why the hell isn't anyone spawning on me'
* Allows the target to try and avoid suppression before they are 'fully suppressed'


There should also be an indicator on the spawn screen that shows who is suppressed

* Prevents people from wondering why the hell they can't spawn


I've always thought suppression was a great idea that could encourage team play and lead to deeper tactics. It just didn't turn out that way. I think the above 'system' could really add some interesting decisions to the game. Do I choose the larger, sole-surviving squad member in great tactical position) try to run for cover and risk getting shot, or sit here and hope I can wait it out until that LMG runs out of bullets?


The main reason I think this is a good way to go about suppression is it actually gives a person incentive to suppress his enemy. Suppression always felt like a bonus in BF3. I never shot to suppress someone. I shot to kill them. If I didn't think I could kill the person, and risk being shot while reloading my now-empty gun. If, however, I knew I could prevent that person's squad mates from spawning on them, I would be much more inclined to empty a mag in his general direction.


I'd love to hear your thoughts.

1374210432.0,1im3ge,The disparity between small arms and missile damage,rainkloud,76,14,82,"In Bf3, a Stationary TOW launcher did massive damage while an AGM fired from a jet did considerably less. 

Now that weapon ammo is purported to be limited

Here's how the missile weapons were represented in BF3:

| Weapon   | Warhead Weight (kg) | Damage vs MBT | Damage vs Jet
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|:------------
| RPG       | 2   |   41   |na
|   IFV GM|  5.9  |    41 |na
| Hellfire (Heli AGM) |9| 41|na 
| Maverick (Jet AGM) |136|41|na
| Stinger | 3| na|  65
| Sidewinder (Jet Heatseeker| 9| na| 45

That's not to say that I expect a Maverick to do 68x more damage than an RPG does   but it should do fairly critical damage and should ignore reactive armor and iron fist. A similar situation appears with Stingers. Although there's a good reason why they do so much damage there's not a good reason why heatseekers shouldn't be a 2 hit kill against other jets. 

The counter measure system is also getting major overhaul to coincide with limited ammo for heavy weapons:

| Counter  | Effective Jam Time |Reload Time | 
|:-----------|:------------|:------------
| IR Smoke    | 7   |   15   
|  (New) Smoke|  ? |   ?
|(New) Iron Fist| ?|? 
|Flares|3.5|15
|ECM| 7 |30

**CREDIT TO LYRA AND BON BON OF THE CLAN BON BON FOR BF4 ALPHA COUNTER MEASURE TIMES**


So it appears the days are gone when tanks could just smoke out of any situation involving guided missiles. Now that active radar missiles (requiring a constant lock) are in play I hope we'll also see the end of ""below radar"" effecting heating seeking missiles. Finally

In any event I really hope we'll see more variety in the characteristics between the missiles. Having them do all 41 dmg despite the warheads ranging vastly in size. What the hell

* More variety in the damage done by the various warheads (while keeping balance by tinkering with reload and ammo count values).

* Heavy Missiles from IFV GM on up should ignore reactive armor.

* Laser targeting should not increase damage but only lock on range.

* Below radar shouldn't effect heat seeking missiles.

1372173315.0,1h1hte,Battlelog Suggestion - Create a Squad,SirBuckeye,66,5,29,"When I play Battlefield with my friends, it needs to be fixed.

**We Come Not to Party**

First of all, but can designate another player to be the squad leader by right-clicking them or maybe hitting a star icon beside their name.  Members of the squad will all be in a group chat in Battlelog to get things sorted.

**Join Together**

When a member of the squad joins a server, the server creates a new squad and puts all the members into it.  This part is non-negotiable.  This is the only function Battlelog needs.  Once this part is working, DICE can truly say that *""It's never been easier to play with friends""*.  Same team.  Same Squad.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.  Also, the squad leader you designated in Battlelog, will be the SL in the game.

**Stay Together**

Squads created through Battlelog and joining together get a special attribute called ""bound"".  They could have a little icon in the UI like the lock symbol, or rage quits will never break up a bound squad.

**Wait for me**

When you try to join a friend that's already playing, or the round ends, then it lets you in and puts you on the correct team.

**Balance Issues**

So the big problem here is team balance, move an entire squad to balance the game.  If it's 13-8, is there a squad of 2 on the bigger team?  Move 'em.  If not, how about 3?  No?  Okay then, move on to individual players in unbound squads.  Start with the smallest unbound squads.  Is there an unbound squad of four?  Move two of them.  Since the squad is unbound, it's less likely that they're buddies.  There are, of course, you just have to put the new squad on the losing team and ride it out.  That's a problem

**tl;dr**  

**Pro:**  Form a squad in Battlelog and always be on the same team and in the same squad with your friends.  
**Con:** Occasionally have to deal with unbalanced teams.

I think it's worth it.  What do you think?

1371099366.0,1g8zjh,IAM Alpha 04 from the E3 stream. AMA about my BF4 Pre-Alpha experience/gameplay.,QuePasaGuey,71,6,73,"Hey all, so I can talk a bit about that as well.

Some main things I'll go ahead and mention now:

1) As you probably know

2) Right off the bat I opted to configure my Assault class a bit instead of changing my keybindings. I put on the new RDS, felt even less clunky than the Kobra. I also put on the new Green Laser Sight, which from what I understand trades the blinding component of the Red Laser Sight for a bit more visual stealth when it's not shining directly at an enemy soldier. I also put on an attachment that reduced the initial recoil of your weapon (the strong recoil that comes with the first shot in every burst).

3) I was able to click directly on my spawnpoints/squadmates

4a) On to the ammo... oh man was it bad, is that the ammo bags were NOT on by default, so my constant Q spamming on the support guys was futile unless they were knowledgeable enough to look at their loadout. With more ammo for the primary weapon, there really wouldn't have been an excuse to go less than 20-0 in the group I was with.

4b) Every kit you saw me pick up was empty. Not sure if this was a bug or intentional, but that after picking up a kit WITHOUT a secondary, all the following secondaries I find are also out. This leads me to believe that my second theory is true, because I definitely don't think everyone died with empty secondaries.

5) Swimming and shooting! I dove in and realized that my gun was out, it felt right, and it made the kill even more satisfying for me than it was for you all.

6) Someone asked somewhere what happens when you are in the building during the collapse. I was in the elevator actually. The spectator guy had just left my first person cam to watch the whole thing come down

7) And finally, but instead they managed to get the epic 3-5 minutes of me with no ammo, no support players, and useless kit switching. Yet I haven't seen anyone actually give the REAL reason for why I couldn't knife: the kit I picked up **didn't actually have one**! I was mashing the button, which albeit took me two keypresses to remember because I have everything bound differently at home, and nothing was happening. On the loadout screen you can actually select between two types of knives. I honestly forget what the descriptions said, all I know is that I ended up choosing the basic one. My guess is that you can either accidentally leave off a knife, because after another pair of kit switches

Anyways, but I'm not dedicating specific time to sitting at the keyboard to answer them. Remember, I also played commander mode, so that's free game as well. All in all, the game was awesome, minus the frustrating ammo starvation. It feels familiar coming from BF3 (as LevelCap mentioned today in his video), and the UI is way cleaner, but I'm sure DICE has commander balance at the top of their priority. Nevertheless

As we all know by now

I will start by introducing my judgements to give an overall asumption on what i believe the game would be like after release with this feature and what ways it could be improved. First of all I agree that small arms fire should damage aircrafts, the problem was that most of the time the aircraft was already taken by some idiot that never seems to notice the enemy craft and just carries on trying to kill infantry.

Introducing small arms fire is a welcoming sight from the days of playing bad company

Although i like the looks of small arms damage, which was a lot more prodominant in bad company 2:vietnam. On conquest, one person with an m60 could single handedly cripple a huey which would always result in the huey having to make an emergancy landing to repair practically EVERY time it just gained altitude. After moving onto bf3 and later returning back to vietnam, i noticed that the hueys were never used on the maps i joined. No one even bothered using them anymore apart from the odd 1 or 2 people over time.

Again

This made me think alot on how bf4 would play out and i am really uncertain on how this could lead out. My brain is telling me that small arms fire is a tactical and fair defence against aircrafts while my heart is telling me that the days of the choppers are over because of lock on weapons

Other thoughts tell me that we might pull through if more maps in bf4 are going to have more cover for choppers like in seige of shanghai. We already have auto repair which is a feature that was not in any of the bad companies

-Damage to helos would be more potent in certain points of the chopper. if you were to shoot at a helo's belly or sides etc

I tried searching just now for non-hardcore 64 player servers with 1-10 slots open. Literally none of the results suit the above. 

So I guess what I'm asking is:

Would the game benefit from restricting what server administrators are allowed to change? Maybe changing certain things should exclude them from quick match?

Here is a list of variants from the past:

===Conquest: Assault===

One team is specified as the attacker (pre-determined, so the attacking team usually starts with ticket bleed at the round's start and must neutralize at least one flag to stop it.

===Conquest: Head-On===
Each team has at least one uncapturable base. If one team capture more than half the total number of flags on a map

===Conquest: Double Assault===
Each team starts with at least one control point. All control points on the map are capturable and capturing more than half of the flags will inflict ticket bleed.

===Conquest: Assault Lines===

A new gamemode variant exclusive to the Battlefield 2142: Northern Strike booster pack, while the PAC team has all the remaining control points. However, the PAC home base cannot be captured unless the EU team controls all the other flags on the map, forcing more defense onto flags that have already been captured. If the PAC flag is captured, all players on the EU team receive an award. However, if the PAC manages to recapture a base, the round will continue. If they recapture their home base

===Conquest: Double Assault Lines===
A new twist on a twist. This gamemode has only been seen following the Battlefield 2142 1.40 patch on the Highway Tampa map. The only difference to Assault Lines is that both teams now have a base that is uncapturable until all the other flags are taken.

[sauce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_(gametype))

Battlefield 3 was predominantly Conquest: Head-On. This resulted in often drawn out battles where one team is pummeled by the other

There were only four Conquest: Assault maps in Battlefield 3:

Wake Island
Sharqui Peninsula
Strike at Karkand
Talah Market

All other maps were Conquest: Head-On.

Conquest Head-On works fine for maps that are super massive, Or Armored Kill maps.

However, pushing the enemy back into the uncap, at which point they being the rape-machine. In all other variants, the round would end when a team holds all flags (and the other team is eliminated, can no longer capture flags).

You might say: Oh, not really. In Single Assault, the team that has an uncap typically only has one base, while the other team has all other bases, or all but one of the bases. A half witted team can easily hold majority bases if they try.

The best part of Assault / Double Assault is that it ends rounds before players start to drop due to rape. A round quickly ends, but it would result in far less player attrition.

Conquest

&gt;Default Weapons:

**25 MM** - Strong against other Aircraft/ Weak vs Armor

**30 MM** - Inaccurate vs Aircraft/ Strong vs Armor

&gt;Secondary Weapons

**Heatseekers** - Likely unchanged from BF3 version. Low damage but easy to use.

**Maverick (Guided Missile from BF3)** - Likely unchanged as well. Small possibility that you can actually fire Tom Cruise at unsuspecting armor and convert them to Scientology. Damage increased by Soflam. 

**Guided Homing Missiles** - Possibly a version of ground attack missile that requires that you maintain a lock on. Higher Damage than Maverick since it requires more effort for hit. Unknown if counter-able by most likely yes. May or may not benefit from Soflam.

**Active Radar Missiles** - An AA missile that requires a constant lock for impact. Higher dmg than Heatseekers. Presumed counter-able.

&gt;Counters

**ECM** - Mostly the same as BF3

**Flares** - Mostly the same as BF3

**Fire Extinguisher** - Hopefully wrong about this but I presume this is returning to countermeasure slot. This means it will go largely unused in HC and have only slightly more use in SC. IMO would be better off used in the upgrade slot.

&gt;Upgrades

**AutoPilot** - I suspect this is what we know of as ""Maintenance""

**Reload  (Beltspeed)** - Increase burst length and decreases cooldown. Viable now that Radar should be default

**Stealth** - Increases the time needed to lock on to you. Reduces the time you stay spotted.

**Proximity Scan** - Scans a 5m radius around your craft which is useful if you're worried about infantry parachuting and skyjacking you. At least that's what it did in BF3. Hopefully they've either turned this into a ground version of air radar or have made the range specific to each class of vehicle (tank gets 5m while Jet gets 100m) Possibly placed in game to troll me personally.

&gt;Random thoughts...

* *Rocket Pods are now relegated to the attack jet which is presumably balanced by the fact they are more vulnerable.* 

* *Beam Scanning appears to have been retired.*

* *Air Radar is presumed default since it's not an unlock.*

* *No below Radar spotted either...unless it was below radar....and we couldn't spot it....get it? NM.*

---





Really hoping you can equip both Anti Air and Anti Ground Weapons. Otherwise you're going to have AGM picked *heavily* over AAM. The only way around that I can see is if they make Counter measures only effective against one type of missile or the other (e.g. flares effective against heat seekers but not radar ""active"" missiles).  That would create a strong enough incentive to make the choice of AAM vs AGM more difficult.

I'm inclined to think that might be the case since ground vehicles now have the Iron Fist system. So the question becomes

Unless they're going to create a tier system. Which I hope they don't. A tier system where older unlocks are obsolete once new ones are unlocked. Not only is that punitive towards newer players but the end game becomes duller as well as you limit the options.

My guess is that Tanks will use smoke to deflect the traditional guided missiles while using the Iron Fist to ward off the Radar Lock ones.

If not

a good example was during the EA press conference they dropped a tank  through the street using a M320/203UGL what would stop me from using an M320 or larger projectile to blow a hole in the street and dropping down into the access hallways below? Same concept. If we can blow up stuff to go up why not blow it up to go down.

**What kind of water vehicles will there be?**

Amphibious Assault will play a big role in Battlefield 4 as we’ve added attack boats like the RCB-90 (U.S.) and jet-skis. Controlling the sea in addition to the land and air will play a crucial role in victory.

And, you’ll also be able to use one-handed weapons and one-handed gadgets while in water for the first time.

How it works: You aim at the cover to calculate the distance
The grenade will track the distance it has traveled by the amounts of spins it has done and will explode in the air taking out the person behind cover.

It might even be possible to increase/decrease this distance manually  by up to 3 meters(you can irl). This is for if the cover is really thick

It can also be used to make your own estimation on the distance. For example if you are under heavy fire and can't peek you could aim at something closer then the target cover and add a few meters.

I think this is awesome


NOTE: This is how it works in real life

===========================================================================================

Part 1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack Helicopters
	1. 00:40 Gunner has more recoil than in BF3.
	
	2. 00:43 Air space seems to be limited to the same
	space alotted to infantry units instead of more
	air space than infantry like in BF3.
	
	3. 00:43 When gunner has no left over rounds
	replenishing 30 rounds took about 4 seconds.

	4. 00:56 When gunner has left 30 left over rounds
	replenishing 30 rounds took about 16 seconds.

	5. 01:15 Gunner reload time seems to take less over-
	all time (possibly the player is running belt speed).
	
	6. 02:26 Being in an attack helicopter (perhaps even
	all vehicles) does not add points to the squad specializations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spawn Screen 
	1. 03:27 Respawn timer in conquest is about 5 seconds.

	2. 03:27 Only the Medic Bag is shown and not the Medic
	Kit (small version of Medic Bag). Perhaps you can only 
	choose one or the other? Or you are always given the Med 
	Kit which would be a bad idea for balancing reasons.
	
	3. 03:27 Map seems to show a lot of room in water.

	4. 03:27 Picture in picture to show where you spawn for a
	fixed location seems pretty crappy (could be color scheme
	or camera angle).

	5. 03:27 Under the picture in picture in lower left corner
	shows a button ""Team Setup"". Perhaps brings player to squad
	menu or something totally different.

	6. 03:56 Picture in picture shows the name of the place selected
	to spawn at. Flag D is nicknamed ""Arcade"". Flag E is""Restaurant"".

	7. 04:27 Underneath the scoreboard shows ""Commander Score"".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infantry
	
        1. 04:48 Medic bag seems to have odd physics by rolling around.

	2. 05:20 Player switched to gunner seat then switched back to 
	driver seat without going through all seats to get back to driver
	seat like in BF3.

	3. 05:24 Minimap shows an arrow pointing to an objective. Commander probably told the infantry to cap it.

	4. 05:59 Minimap still shows an arrow pointing to flag E. Commander
	probably told the infantry to defend it or it just stays there until
	the Commander gives further instructions.

	5. 07:13 Minimap shows an arrow pointing to a new objective.
	
	6. 07:25 Player gets Flag Possession when entering the premisis
	of the flag his/her team owns. Receives 40 points.

	7. 08:55 Players get 30 points for healing squad members
        probably goes for resupplies.

	8. 09:31 Incindiary grenades have a large blast radious and last     a good 4 seconds or so.

	9. 09:57 Killcam follows your killer while being stationary above your body.

	10. 09:57 Killcam interface is updated

	11. 10:02 Killcam lasts about 8 seconds total in conquest (Entire killcam for conquest in BF3 took about 11 seconds in total).

	12. 10:38 When the squad receives the ammo specialization

	13. 11:13 T-POSE! (need to watch Part 1 to understand)

	14. 11:06 Player no longer does a full reload.

============================================================================================================================

Part 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infantry 
	
	1. 00:48 Player spawns with more ammo proving my point I made in Point 12 in the Infantry sub-topic of Part 1.

	2. 01:26 Press E to Enable Power on a generator

	3. 4:00 Squadmate support player to the left is using some kind of at least 5 shot seemingly grenade launcher of sorts on enemy tank. Possibly the XM-25. See 4.

	4. 4:49 After bringing up the brightness

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Tank

	1. 06:55 Player receives Flag Possession

	2. 10:29 Tank replenishes health by itself when at 12% (Possibly running maintenance upgrade).

	3. 10:51 White marker to the right of crosshairs indicate the location of where you are being targeted.

	4. 10:53 IR Smoke is a bit different than in BF3 by not completely encompassing the vehicle.
	
	5. 10:53 IR Smoke now has a countdown timer indicator and takes 15 seconds to be reloaded.

==============================================================================================================================

Throughout Part 1 and Part 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. Top right corner shows a box where when you click on it it will bring up a menu of

	2. On the bottom of the screen (when infantry) there is a rectangular box with a list of things. One of which is of lines with the key V to use. What is this? The others are also odd considering there is one of a flashlight while the player does not have the tac light equipped.

	3. Dice shamelessely self promotes themselves by putting their logo on buildings throughout the map (just kidding).

	4. Bringing up the characters hand to spot is inconsistent (sometimes the character brings his hand up

The server problems of Battlefield 3 are set in stone. Since it’s so close to the release of Battlefield 4

By identifying the problems we have faced in Battlefield 3, or lack-there-of, a little easier.

When first introduced, in the game-types they want to play. It would also open up battlefield to more competition, letting clans rent servers so they can train, as well as host matches. All of this would be great, were it not for the fact that DICE forgot to adjust for the human factor. When given control over anything, even something as mediocre as owning and administrating a server, power rushes to people’s heads faster than a snail infused with nitro can finish the Daytona 500. As ridiculous as the previous metaphor may be, as is the case with Battlefield 3.

Inane and inept are two words that come to mind when one thinks of the admins on Battlefield 3. They tend to set forth amazingly stupid rules without proper justification, exactly, is my tactical light going to affect your gameplay experience so dramatically that you must now boot me out of your game? And, finally, how in the world are the slugs in my shotgun going to ruin any possible fun you could have had on this game? It’s rules like these that tend to ruin a lot of potentially good gameplay. In Battlefield 4, DICE should be able to solve this problem easily. 

The first system they should implement is a rating system. Players should be able to give a yay or nay vote on the server, they will probably won't have too many people join their server. If there is no real repercussion other than less people on the player’s server, than what’s the point of having the rating system in the first place? The use of incentives based around the player’s performance as an admin would be a great start.

As any economics expert or mafia boss would tell you, weapon and soldier skins/camos, vehicle unlocks, weapon accessories, and more. Admins that are able to keep a server running with happy people deserve some sort of reward, right? The level of rewards you get would be based off your percentage; the higher the percentage, the better the battlepacks you receive. If DICE doesn’t want to give out battlepacks full of stuff that you should only unlock via leveling up, but still gives admins a reason to be good.  Anything would work

So I've been watching the E3/Alpha footage again this morning because I have no life, and it does seem to decrease in certain clips.

I've thoroughly enjoyed the BF series since BF2 and the changes to the series have always fascinated me (it's kind of like watching evolution unfold in front of you).  There seems to have been a significant change in TTK over the years, but dissatisfied with the netcode situation.  There are pros and cons for each version:

**Low TTK**

* More realistic
* Makes the killers feel awesome
* Speeds up gameplay
* Frustrates the hell out of the killed which can lead to more stalemates and less tactical thinking
* Leaves the dead feeling like crap and robs them of confidence in their own abilities

**High TTK**

* Less realistic
* Frustrates the shooter (""WHY WON'T YOU DIE?!"") while the target bunny-hops/dolphin-dives their way to safety
* Robs the shooter of confidence
* Can lead to some seriously goofy firefights/clusterf*cks
* Makes the target feel invincible

It is also important to note that TTK is just one factor of the whole player survivability model in each game.  Other factors include (but aren't limited to):

* Headshot/critical hit damage
* Player movement speeds
* Player reaction time/choices
* Healing/revive/resupply speed
* Visibility/suppression effects
* Environmental effects and objects and their hitboxes
* Buffs/Debuffs (conditional or unconditional damage/survivability modifiers)
* Weapon stats (TTK is a derivative/function of these stats which include ROF
* Emergent player behavior (which can hardly be predicted
* Netcode/lag issues

Obviously, that would be awesome.  Also, if anyone has any ideas for improving it or balancing it, I'd love to hear them too, but keep 'em reasonable.


[*I'd like to be clear that I'm aware that balancing a massive game like this is extremely difficult and I do not think that Demize99 and the rest of the team have an easy job.  They clearly made some tough/unpopular decisions and got serious flak for it, but merely gather opinions and insight on the game.*]

1365448318.0,1bxov3,My fix ideas inside! (no one will care though),therealrhyno,58,24,38,"Straight to business.

* Fix the hit detection (Client side). This is THE biggest concern for me. Dying behind corners, getting rid of Client side hit detection makes it harder for hackers to create hacks that abuse Client side by getting mass kills with a Medkit for example. If the ""client"" reports a kill, the server will check and confirm. Server side will fix a lot of this.

* PLEASE remove the jumping animation. I want to jump. Not do some cinematic jump that looks cool. It isn't reliable half the time you need it to be and you die. Not to mention it messes with the hitboxes and makes it impossible to kill someone in the middle of the animation.

* Fix the spawn protection. Spawning on a squad mate should NOT make a person immune to dying. The risk of spawning on someone in a firefight makes it a risk-reward system. You may win a battle

* Let's get it so every gun has different traits. Not every assault rifle does 25 damage per bullet with the exception of a couple. 

* Please for the love of God remove Suppression. If you aren't going to remove it at least fix it! Don't magically change the characteristics of my weapon and make it have more spread when an inanimate object doesn't know Suppression exists. 

* This shouldn't even need to be listed

1371153705.0,1gag96,Locking Weapons - a Game Design Discussion,Zyrisk,62,31,100,"####This is the first piece of information regarding Battlefield 4 that has seriously concerned me
In [a recent interview](http://youtu.be/0tmEjpI51R0?t=16m50s) Daskro states that “I did get to use both the RPG-7 and the Stinger for the engineer class.  They feel very similar to Battlefield 3

####This is not a balance discussion
We've seen threads discussing Stinger/Igla balance a hundred times already.  A balance discussion is not appropriate because we don't know the state of BF4's balance.  This discussion is about game design

####Weapons should be engaging
Most of the weapons in BF3 engage the player with their distinct characteristics and subtle nuances.

There are a lot of engaging and interesting weapons in BF3.  A perfect example is the RPG-7.  

####The RPG-7 is engaging
It is:

* *Skillful* - Mastering the speed and arc of the RPG-7 makes it possible to accomplish amazing feats of long range accuracy.  With enough effort

* *Interactive* -  When you use an RPG-7, dodging, and reorienting their vehicle’s armor.

* *Risky* - Firing a SMAW of RPG-7 lights you up like a christmas tree.  The rocket’s loud sound effects

* *Counterable* - The repair tool does a respectable job of mitigating the RPG-7’s damage.  Drivers and pilots can lower their chances of being hit by moving quickly and changing directions often.  Some vehicles can also equip Reactive Armor.

* *Predictable* - As long as the user is not suppressed, and obvious graphical cues.

####Locking weapons in BF3 are not engaging
They are not:

* *Skillful* - To fire a locking weapon you have to: 1) Aim vaguely at the target

* *Interactive* -  The user and the target of a locking weapon are not interacting in an interesting or engaging manner.  One player aims

Some maps provide more interesting interactions in the form of cover and buildings to block the locking weapon’s path.  This is more of an example of a player interacting with the environment rather than players interacting with each other.  Ideally

A player can place their locking weapon’s crosshair on a target indefinitely

* *Counterable* - IR Smoke hard counters the javelin and guided missiles

* *Predictable* - Countermeasures will often fail to divert heat seekers.  This degree of randomness is unacceptable.

####This is why you feel cheated when you’re killed by a locking weapon
The utter lack of effort put forth by the user

####Neither player is having fun
This is the antithesis of game design.  The more engaging the weapon is

####Flying a helicopter high and away from the action is the least interesting way to fly
This is the type of playstyle that the game’s mechanics need to discourage

If Below Radar still worked against the Stinger, interesting, and engaging way to fly.  It’s more fun.  It makes the helicopter more vulnerable to other types of attacks, so it also presents players with an interesting tradeoff.

####How do we fix this?
[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/10y94p/lock_on_weapons_in_bf3/) posted by a very experienced scout helicopter pilot provides some very well thought out solutions to this problem.


*Fixes:*

* *Change the way countermeasures work* - Make countermeasures 100% reliable

* *Make locking weapons dodgeable* - This could add a ton of interesting maneuvers and strategies to the game.

* *Make aim matter* - The more centered the target is

*Other Fixes:*

* *BC2 tracer darts* -  In order to lock a target

* *Remove locking weapons entirely* -  Favor the use of vehicle-based AA solutions and infantry-based guided rockets like BC2's AT4.

####Are we jumping the gun here?
No.  If BF3 has shown us anything, interactive, and skillful game mechanics for our locking weapons.

In E3 they demonstrated very extensively ""new"" feature in Battlefield 4

Player location etc. data is constantly written

**Playback

I don't say it's not more work, button to reset into beginning and take switching between player point of views (POV's) straight from current spectator mode? Just like in Bf 2, basically.

Loading into .demo can be harder concept considering that DICE has ditched whole main menu system and uses Battlelog as replacement. So lets integrate with help of Battlelog developers. 

We could take already existing tab ""Multiplayer"" and under it add tab ""Demos"". When clicked on that option we are taken into simple UI that has file browsing function and button ""Play"". When you click ""Browse"" it would pop open pre-defined (by DICE) demo location folder

System proceeds to boot up game and throws you into recorded demo in free-cam mode.

**Alternatives?**

FRAPS, that argument can be done, but same time it would be just what we have now with Bf 3. You would need to record hours upon hours of footage, watch even more footage and then proceed to do **a lot** editing in order to make cool videos.

If DICE wants enable us to make those ""old school"" cool **Battlefield moment** videos something like Battlerecorder is rather essential tool. This way you don't need record hours upon hours footage

**Conclusion**

First of all

Second

**It's time to make Battlefield moment videos

Edit: Naturally even larger streamlining would be have automatic recording by game

**Classes:**

**Assault:** aggressive frontline class.

*Primary:* Various ARs with 3 attachments or shotguns. Silencers only on select guns. Tactical lights.    
*Equipment 1:* 

* under barrel shotguns with various ammo like BF3. Not necessarily mounted like BF3. 

* under barrel launchers with various ammo

* breach charges. Mountable on walls/doors and open up hole when detonated by timer. Allow for player to stand very close to charge without taking damage. Damages enemies on other side and disorients at even greater range in other side.  

*Equipment 2:* adrenaline shot like BC1. Quick

*Options grenade substitute:* 2x flash bang



**Engineer:** vehicle based class like BF3. 

*Primary:* Carbines and SMGs or shotguns. No silencers. 3 attachments.
*Equipment 1:* 

* RPG/SMAW. Like BF3's

* AT4/Gustav. Faster rockets like BC2's Gustav allowing for farther tank engagement or better accuracy at aircraft.  Less damage. Won't one hit kill aircraft

* javelin. Location fire only without lock on. Can be used to hit stationary vehicles

* ERYX or equivalent wire guided. Like BF2 AT rockets or BC2 AT4.
 
* MANPADS (stingers). Similar to BF3 versus jets. Can't hit helicopters below a significant altitude (below radar). Faster rockets

*Equipment 2:*

* repair tool. Not as good at destroying as BF3's. 

* improved EOD bot. Converts land mines and equipment

* AT mines

*Optional grenade substitute:* can't think of one. Feel free to suggest one

*Other:* can fix bridges like BF2. 



**Support:** class to back up infantry

*Primary weapon:* LMGs and shotguns. 3 attachments. 

*Equipment 1:*

* ammo packs. Resupplies infantry and vehicles. 

* deploy tripod weapon. Can deploy tripoded .50s, very slow resupply, and health. Engineers can repair when damaged. One at a time and cool down. Can be used by anyone, but enemies chat fix or resupply. 

*Equipment 2:* 

* time fused C4. Can be defused by enemy engineers. 

* claymores 

* mortar. aiming and damage like that of mobile artillery in AK and recoil. Can have aim assisted by recons. When recon requests some kind of assistance appears to hit very close to request. Smoke, flares

*Optional grenade substitute:* 2x smoke

*Other:* can fix bridges like BF2 engineers. 



**Recon:** sniper and reconnaissance. 

*Primary weapon:* DMRs

*Equipment 1:* 

* spawn beacon. Would be neat to actually parachute from an aircraft. 

* jammer. Hides 2D spotting for enemy in radius. No dot when spotted or firing. 

* remote C4. 

*Equipment 2:* 

* TUGS

* UAV. Like BF3's MAV. Can also request artillery/mortar/bombing on location

* SOFLAM. Auto spot or remotely controlled. Targets much like BF3's. Has red light.

* binoculars. Visually like BC2's. Function like a SOFLAM. No red light. Require targeting whole time. If recon looses target target missiles will still follow the binoculars focus or if put away/killed his go straight.

*Option grenade substitute:* 2x marking smoke. Can be used to request a mortar/artillery/bombing. Farther throwing distance than normal grenades. 



**Medic:** well rounded medic class

*Primary:* ARs, lighter LMGs, and shotguns. 2 attachments. Can be silenced. 

*Equipment 1:* 

* defibrillator. Has cool down. Can't revive some deaths. 

*Equipment 2:*

* med packs. 

*Option grenade substitute:* smoke. To cover revives. 

* if you can think of more medic equipment feel free to suggest



**Squad leaders:** can request support from commander. Receives points for following commander directions. Can direct squad mates. Spawn location. Squad gets point bonuses for following orders and being near. 



**Commander:** directs squad leaders. Gets points for assisting team

*Abilities:* 

* some may be available based on captured bases like BF3 AC-130 and C-130. 

* supply drop. Provide ammo and health to all team assets. 

* transport drops. Drops transport vehicles. Drop from aircraft. 

* UAV. Like BF2 UAV. 

* drone strikes or artillery or bombing

* dropship. Like in EG. Can pick direction and allows for deploying of troops and drops 1 APC per pass.
 
* could use some more here abilities of things to improve from BF2. 



**Vehicles:** similar active and passive spec. A mix if same pick a secondary or pick two weapons. Some new specs and features and classes. Also, sub, battleship like 1942 so I'll suggest my wishes for land and air. 



**MBTs:** like every BF.

*Weapons (pick two

* HE shell

* AP shell

* Canister shell. Hopefully penetrates walls if destruction is good enough. 

* guided shell (user guided

* phosphorus shell

* fused shell. Can blow up near targets without impact. 

* coaxial LMG

* coaxial HMG

*Active:* 

* smoke 

* thermal

* zoom

* extinguisher 

*Passive:* 

* auto loader

* stealth

* reactive armour 

* active defense system. Can intercept slower incoming projectiles like rockets

* speed. Boost top speed and acceleration.
 
* maintence

* area effect. Like BF2's. Medic heals near by infantry, recon hides removes spotting on near by allies, and assault significantly reduces suppression to near by infantry.

* ammo
  
*Gunner:* 7.62mm robot by default

* .50 exposed

* proxy scan

* grenade launcher exposed

* area effect

* thermal

*Third seat:* laser painter. Or mortar on Merkava if it's in game. 



**APCs:**  resupplies and heals passengers

*Weapons (pick two

* active defense system. 

* speed.

* maintence

* area effect

* ammo

*Gunner:* 7.62mm robot by default

* .50 exposed

* proxy scan

* area effect

* thermal



**Tank destroyers:** so on like other armour. No gunner like BF3. 



**Self propelled artillery:** have mortar/howitzer like guns. Faster and more armoured than truck missile based ones in BF3 but slower firing and weaker.  Air burst and regular HE. Aiming much like BF3s. Can be assisted by recon like mortars. When assisted have ability to the fire 5 or show shells really quick that land in same area at same time. Have some machine guns for defense. Specs like tanks. 



**Artillery trucks:** like BF3s. Higher damage and faster firing than self propelled



**Mobile AA:** much like BF3. Specs like tanks. Maybe a flak weapon option



**Jeeps:** basically the same as always. 



**Cars:** Humvee

*Driver specs:* 

* speed

* bullet proof glass

* area effect

* armour. Lowers disable percent. 

*Gunner:* default robot 7.62

* exposed .50

* exposed grenade launcher 

* thermal

* AA like BF3 EG



**Fighter jets:** don't disable but don't auto repair. Runway repairing. Can't see spotted enemies from long distances. Recon need to target vehicle for them to bee seen from distances. Also

*Secondary Weapons:*

* heat seekers

* rocket pods

* dumb bomb



**Attack jets:** like BF3

*Secondary Weapons:*

* heat seeker

* rocket pods

* missile

* cluster dumb bomb



**2 seated bomber jets:** same things as other jets. 

*Pilot:*

* heat seekers

*Passenger:* pick 2

* TV guided missiles/bombs

* dumb bomb

* cluster bomb

* laser guide missiles



**Attack helicopters:** pretty much like BF3 spec wise. Have below radar to prevent stinger lock at low level. 

*Pilot weapons:* pick 2

* heat seekers

* Hydra rockets or equivalent (more splash

* Hellfire or equivalent (less splash

*Gunners:* gets cannon and then a laser guided missile that can lock or TV. 




**Scout helicopters:** similar spec to BF3. Below radar

*Pilot secondary weapons:*

* heat seekers

* Hydra rockets

* Hellfire missile



**Transport helicopters:** no weapons for pilot. Similar specs to other choppers. Repel rope by default. Allow gunners to choose between standard armour piecing and high explosive incendiary for some more splash. Spawn location for team.

1. Beginning around 1:05:17 you will see the player have 14/98 bullets before reload, exactly the number he had already used with his 31 bullets gun. Weird thing: seconds later, the player ""reloads"" without triggering any reload animation.

2. At around 1:10:43, and after reloading he has 46/184, meaning a full magazine reload of 46 bullets. The 13 bullets were discarded.

Originally i thought of this for just infantry maps but with tanks and helis having IRNV too

Some ideas about these kinda maps:

1: Getting shot in the head area/helmet could result in your IRNV going fuzzy for a couple of seconds

2: The green laser pointers would be invisible to naked eye

3: Some parts of the map could be lit up. For instance

Any thoughts? I wouldnt mind getting a discussion going on this.

http://i.imgur.com/EGke1va.jpg

So if like me you play with a lot of different friends and clan mates at the same time then by giving each of them a different colour you can easily and quickly know who is who on the battlefield even if they are in your squad or not. For example if i had made my friend ""DarkLord7854"" purple colour and my other friend ""Demize99"" yellow colour and was driving a jeep and saw a purple buddy on my mini map just up ahead i would instantly know it was ""DarkLord7854"" and could shout to him on VOIP if he wanted a lift

It will make the game much more fun as it increases teamwork and communication as it did with battlefield vietnam. I know we can currently have 4 friends in our squad in games BF4 but many people have more than 4 friends and clan mates playing at the same time and also having your 4 squad members a different colour would help differentiate between them much easier.

To use this feature in Battlefield Vietnam you had to do the following:
&gt; Quote: -Unique colors for individual buddies. Once a buddy has been added to the buddylist.con (located in the settings\profiles\profile_name folder), and for text, and death messages. For instance, game.addPlayerToBuddyListByName “Player” 255.0 155.0 0.0 = Red(R) 255.0, Green(G) 155.0, Blue(B) 0.0 –&gt; an Orange buddy icon.

Sinper

The sniper aspect of the class could be used to help the team be observing how snipers benefit their teams in real life.  As it says on Wikipedia, if necessary, to reduce the enemy's fighting ability by neutralizing high value targets (especially officers, communication and other personnel) and in the process pinning down and demoralizing the enemy. Typical sniper missions include managing intelligence information they gather during reconnaissance and surveillance, target acquisition for air-strikes and artillery, assist employed combat force with fire support and counter-sniper tactics, killing enemy commanders, and even destruction of military equipment, and Denel NTW-20.""  

These roles can be reflected in game.  The first role, the binoculars should also automatically spot enemies (think spotter scope attachment from BFBC2) and include a range finder.  The scopes should be designed so as to make a rangefinder actually useful.  Another thing that could help is to include something similar to the BFBC2 mortar strike, but less spammy.  Also, icluding something similar to the IRNV scope, but make it recon only and less overpowered.  This could be done by making it a gadget that applies to the zoom level you've chosen.  The whole point of the scope is to make seeing enemies easier, and that is what recon is supposed to do.  Because this should be done from a concealed position, another gadget option should be to allow the sniper to wear a ghillie suit, should a prone sniper with this gadget be allowed to be spotted? Let me know what you guys think.

The part about neutralizing enemy officers would be really interesting if Battlefield Commander is incorporated.  Maybe if the commander died, someone on a turret, someone with a deployed lmg, another sniper, or a medic could have distict icons when spotted, and the sniper could get a bonus for killing these people while they are spotted by someone else.  Sniper rifles should have greatly increased suppression per bullet compared to other classes (but no random bullet deviation).  This would represent the fear snipers are supposed to create.

Sniper damage should be adjusted, but at long range it slows down to the point that it transmits all of its energy into the target and puts him on his ass.  This could be reflected by making the sniper get a headshot at medium to long range, and at very long range, allow one hit kill body shots.  This would encourage snipers to help the team from afar.

Scope glint should stay, this would allow players to use the taclight to find snipers by scanning with it in dark places looking for scope glint.

I also propose a trip wire gadget that would basically be a trip wire attached to a flashbang.  The sniper could place it in a door way and the target would be stunned when they activated it and the sniper would be alerted by the loud bang.  Claymores should also be given to the sniper.

Finally, and the ability to shoot through helicopter cockpits.  However the shooter would only be allowed to fire while the weapon was on a bipod.  Also, recoil would be higher than other rifles and could possibly take up one of the gadget slots.  This way, the player can only defend themselves at close range with their pistol.  The anti material rounds would punch holes in walls and destroy other equipment like medpacks, ammo, and things like that in one shot.

Finally, you still hear a loud crack, but you don't know where it's coming from.

Aggressive Recon

The close quarters aspect of recon should also be embraced.  They should be given C4 as a gadget option (and honestly, so no M107, M4A1, and pistol at the same time.  The purpose of this is that the class still wouldn't have the front line power of the assault or support class, but be versatile in combat.

Recon should also be allowed to use two more types of drone.  First would be one of the kite like ones (Israeli Skylark I think) and the player would be able to control it or designate an area for it to orbit and spot automatically.  The other would be really cool for aggressive recon.  A smaller version of the EOD bot that functions as nothing more than a steerable camera.  It can be driven around corners to find/spot enemies

I would also add smoke grenades as a gadget.  As far as the current gadgets go, and remove the spawn beacon.

Thanks to everyone who actually read that whole thing.  Do you guys have any ideas for the recon class?

_________

LIVE UPDATES:

* **Karl Magnus Troedsson**

* In the pre-Alpha stage

* **Levolution** is a ""concept""

* **Spectator mode is confirmed.** You can spectate through **first person

* Changes to the **suppression system** are confirmed. Suppression is now more heavily focused on the support class. Magnus Troedsson says it will be much more obvious in long range combat

* Thanks to /u/SchnitzelSandwich for pointing our something I completely forgot to mention: Magnus Troedsson says you will be able to **dive underwater and ""sprint-swim""** both above and below the surface.

* If I heard correctly you can now **lean over cover** with a sniper rifle and look down the scope.

* For those not watching the stream they have 64 computers set up in the corner of the EA booth at E3. There's a big screen playing the reveal trailer.

* **First look at spectator mode!** You can switch between any player

* We're watching from the view of a pilot of a U.S. attack helicopter

* Big news: **having control of different flags will give you different abilities.** In Seige of Shanghai, flag D gives you some sort of scanning device.

* Taking down the skyscrapers is done by shooting down four ""pillars"" on the four corners of the building. It is player controlled

* You can **use pistols while swimming in water.**

* First

* They're running PCs on the show floor. It's also confirmed to run **64 players at 60fps on next generation consoles.** Yesterday we learned it will be 30fps

* More gameplay. We're now looking at a player using a tank. There is an underground parking garage on this maps as well as the metro station we saw yesterday. Patrick Bach says metal detectors are in the metro station

* Helicopter is on fire. Is it me or does that fire look much better than BF3?

* **There is not unlimited ammo for main battle tanks.** It seems that there is for attack helicopters.

* New kind of red dot sight

* ""You can use your sidearm while in the water

* We're watching a guy who seems to be trying to shoot down his team's helicopter with a **stinger**...

* **Knife customisation

* There is still debris falling from the sky around the map following the skyscraper collapse.

* **The commander cannot force people to do things.** If you want to go take a different objective to the one the commander has ordered you to take

* /u/SchnitzelSandwich notes that the stinger appears to have a slightly longer lock on time. Good observation: ""There is a guy who is a Medic who pulled out what looked like his defibs. It says that he has 2 ammo left when he pulled it out. **Limited revives maybe?**""

* More gameplay. We're looking at the free camera in spectator mode

* One minor thing is that bullets are now much more obvious as they go through the air. Not sure if they have tracers or not but there are orange streaks all over the place in hotspots on the map.

* One thing that seems to have changes is that it is no longer the case that enemies are orange and you are blue, I'm not sure why this is the case.

* There seems to be **a lot of microdestruction**. Think Close Quarters

* I'm off,False,self,t5_2uie9,1370983569.0,rumor,pc,t3_1g55z3

1371668105.0,1go88e,[Suggestion] BF4 - 72 Player servers,Apocalyptical,44,18,30,"So in BF3 32 vs 32 (64 Player) servers worked really well because you could end up with 8 full squads working together on each side.  With the squads bumping up to 5 players (from 4) it throws off this balance and you will end up with 6 full squads and 2 loners; plus the commander who doesn't take up a squad spot.

My request is the the server player count be increased from 64 to 72 so that in a full game all the squads can be maxxed out which theoretically would result in better team play...

TLDR:

* 66 Players = 6 Full Squads + 2 loners + 1 Commander
* 72 Players = 7 Full Squads + 1 Commander


EDIT:

Also want to point out that this wouldn't just be a change for the large the other server player counts would change too.

 • 16 player servers would now be 20 players (+2 Commander spots)

 • 32 player servers would now be 40 players (+2 Commander spots)

 • 64 player servers would now be 70 players (+2 Commander spots)

 
Of course these are just the default sizes, 60 player servers as well. The purpose of the change isn't to make the servers bigger it's to balance the squads so that they can be maxxed out if the players choose to.

 * The Premium Service gave you all five expansion packs plus access to the Premium Member perks and specials.  It did not include the base game.  This will probably be available within a couple months after launch.  it's a decent deal because it's actually less than the cost of all the expansions purchased individually.

**Premium Edition - $60**

* The Premium Edition bundled the base game together with the Premium Service for one low price.  This was an insane deal

If you fly the helicopter so that you control the [**yaw**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes) with your mouse X axis, if you control the yaw with mouse, there is a threshold speed you have to move the mouse at before it starts to turn at all, making it very annoying to do fine tune aiming with.

I personally would make it so that you could have a more open flanking type route above the Metro Station so to get from one side of the map to the other you can go above or below ground. The top of the map could be similar to Seine Crossing. But that's just my opinion

So, information about the maps, interviews with devs or staff, etc.  Basically all of the questions that we had during E3 posted into one thread so we can get the most out of it.

I know we'll probably see a lot of new footage come out of GC

To start

1: (Assuming this is a newer build that we'll see) What are some of the major changes you've noticed between the E3 build and the GC build?

* Animations?
* Effects/Textures/Models?
* Any new levolution moments?
* UI features?
* Etc.

2: What new things do we have to look forward to?

* Weapons/attachments
* Gadgets/knives
* Customization options (skins/emblems/camos)
* Vehicles/customizations

3: How do you feel the game has changed/progressed from BF3 overall?  Do you get the feeling from this build that this is just going to be BF3.5 as some people believe or does it genuinely feel like a fresh new entry into the series?

4: How does the new Battlelog integration feel?  Is it still clunky and awkward or does it verge on seamlessness?

* Did you get to play around with the new tablet or mobile UIs?

5: How does the balance feel?

6: Any classic BF glitches still present?

Well then out of nowhere my post got taken down for no apparent reason when it was only a few hours old. I had no idea why and messaged the mods to ask what I did wrong so I could prevent it in the future. I never got response.  I wonder if this is the reason. No idea.

Transport helicopters are (to me) like boats in bf3, but maybe increase the damage/accuracy of the side guns.
 
The problem with points can be easily solved and was addressed by a user in the comment section of a post. The pilot should gain points obviously if someone spawns on him

Another reason why I believe the transport helicopters are untouched is how helpless it is from ground and air. If the only form of protection is from the underpowered, the pilot gets a SOFLAM/heatseeker ability to further protect itself from air threats, and also have customisation like the attach helicopters such as proximity scan, laser painter, auto loader-like perk which could speed up the cooling down process of the mini guns and other perks.

1369103544.0,1eqm5c,Sniping in Battlefield 4 and Recon Balance (very long),luckySkillFaker,22,6,15,"hey reddit :) so today I want to talk and go over some of my ideas for sniping and the recon kit in Battlefield 4. So please feel free to share your ideas too ;D

ok so let's start out with the weapons we all know that the Sniper Rifles are the main weapons for the recon kit and this is where most people want to see changes in BF4. Many people want to get back the damage from BFBC2 so that OHK are easier achievable and even though this would make the Recon class more viable, just think about all those times where half your time would not move up as attackers on rush. I'm mainly playing the recon class myself and I hate it when people always get down on the snipers. On the other Hand I think there should be a happy medium between playstyles and nobody should be forced to play in a certain way, so how can we get that happy medium between long range/passive and close range/aggressive?


let's start out with the aggressive side since that's what I'm mostly playing so I'm more familiar with it.
As I said in the beginning I like how it takes some skill to play aggressively with bolt action rifles up close
So here is my thought how about a ammo like magnum ammo from BFBC2 which increases damage up close.
Most sniper rifles at the moment have a damage from 80-59
Like this a Headshot would still be a OHK at all ranges (240% damage) and a 3HK at long range which would only make the ammo viable for close range.
The upper Chest hitbox would be a OHK up to lets say 20 meters. (like SV98 in BF3)
However if this would still be too strong I think you could also decrease the bullet velocity ( which would also increase the drop) in order to make it a little bit more challenging.

I think like this it would be a lot easier to play the objective!


Now for long range sniping or passive sniping.
Let's talk about bullet velocity first. (Bullet Velocity in BFBC2 was 600m/S for all rifles) The bullet velocity determines how fast the bullet travels and also how much it drops. The lowest velocity of 490m/s belongs to the M40A5 and the best one of 650m/s to the M98B. So it is pretty much obvious that a long range sniper would go for the M98B. I think its actually pretty balanced with a 12x scope and fewer rounds for its high velocity however I still think that a bullet velocity of 650m/s is not quiet high enough since some of the AR's can shot at 670m/s and I think the highest bullet velocity should belong to a sniper rifle. In my opinion the bullet velocity for the slowest sniper rifle should be 550m/s and for the best one 700m/s to make it a little bit easier to get those needed headshots. 
But we haven't discussed the main problem with long range sniping yet. Which would be that most of them are not playing the objective. I know that many of them are playing a supportive role close to the objective but still behind or with the team which is probably what DICE had in mind ( which also works pretty good) however if there is someone up on a hill trying to get 1000m+ Headshots he isn't helping anybody since he is just playing against other snipers
So much for the nerfs now let's talk about buff's.
I would like to see multiple Ghillie Suits for snipers (desert

so much for the playstyle I know I haven't talked much about the passive inbetween sniper which supports his team since most people I was talking to (who are playing that role) are pretty happy with it.


So now let's talk about gadgets!

I really like the idea behind most the gadgets although I hate that I have to control almost all of them xO! Mav really awesome spotting tool but it makes you stay there out in the open like an idiot so what I would like to see for the MAV if it is making a return in BF4 is that I can aim at a point  on the map radius maybe like 100 meters (maybe like 20meters height above the ground/object) where it will be flying to if I send it there(will hover in the air).
In exchange for that it would do it slowly in a straight line so it would be easy to shoot it down.

For the TUGS make it easier to deploy! just that you can drop it nothing to add here i guess :P

For the Soflam I would like to see it having an attachment slot (like underslung for assault) so you can just aim at the target to designate it. In exchange we would have to sacrifice a attachment slot and it would have decreased range. 

For the Beacon... I'm happy with it :) only problem again is to deploy it! Make it so that you can drop it so it wont attach to the ground but it is faster and safer to put it down.

now for some gadgets which have not been in BF3 which I would like to see in BF4! 

Motion Balls! Please put them back in they were one of the most useful gadgets in the game also encouraged ptfo in my opinion.

C4! I would love to see C4 for the recon kit again
Other throwing mode would be more like BFBC2 although less range than in BFBC2 and it would not stick to anything.

....I know the Recon wont get the C4 back...

so I thought about something else what if the recon would get something like a time-bomb. It would be bale to disable tanks in one blow it would take like 10 seconds for the timer (and if that would be too strong make it so that you can disarm the bomb if you go up and hold e for 2 seconds or so :P


so these were some of my thoughts on sniping in bf4 I had mostly the pc in mind but I think that this would apply very well for the consoles too :)
so please let me know what you would like to see for the recon BF4.

(ps: English is not my first language)

1368482004.0,1e9tey,Let's talk about HUD (or Heads-Up Display).,NoMoreNeedToLive,25,9,18,"One thing many people criticize in Battlefield 3 is its UI (User Interface). Countless of good suggestions have been made about ways to improve the menus




I wasn't all that fond of the BF3 HUD. Let's first talk about the 'static' HUD ( the minimap, the minimap and your ammo) but it also had info that is not necessary to be on the screen the whole time(your squad status, the score, the objective squares and most of the time the minimap wasn't used). The bright colours made it pop out against the environment. While the static HUD isn't great, it was functional.

Now the 'dynamic' HUD (don't know how else I should call it) however, I know what weapon I'm using and I would most likely know how much points a kill earned me. There is no need to flash it in big letters in middle of my screen. A thing that also bothered me at times is that the guns seem rather big and takes up the half of my screen.
**In general** the BF3 HUD showed too many **unnecessary information** and **flashy colours** which contrasted strongly with the environment. All this used **too much place on the screen** hindering the vision and decreasing the beauty of the game. 




The BF4 gameplay trailer has been released and while it HUD might be a placeholder
[3](http://bf3blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/battlefield-3-magnum-3.jpg) [4](http://i266.photobucket.com/albums/ii272/misnomer01/BF4hud_zps7233e051.png).
The first thing that you notice is the colour change. The bright colours have been traded for grey/black. It is very noticeable that the BF4 hud merges more into the environment while still providing clear information. The next difference you notice is the ammo/health indicator on the bottom right. It looks cleaner while providing more information. For the rest we can't talk about all that much since all the other HUD aspects are multiplayer only. The weapon size stays about the same as in BF3. 
**In general** is the **BF4 HUD less outstanding** while still providing all the information you need.




Now suggestions for improving the HUD for BF. 
The main changes needed to solve the problems I have with the BF3 HUD are:

* **Less outstanding colours**. The current BF4 version has already vastly improved on this so I won't be addressing this.

* **Less unnecessary information**. Every piece of HUD that is on screen while you not needed

My suggestion for the latter is simple. The addition of a **tactical view**. When a button is pressed the player gets to see all information, requests of teammates that are relevant to the player (requests should pop on for a while, even if the player is not in tactical view), your/other squads their objective (which would be important if commander mode makes a return), your squads status, ...

When the player is not using tactical view, allies in the line of sight and relevant position (e.g. not a guy on a mountain 1000 meters away from you) and requests. I wouldn't even put the classic minimap in the normal vision since it is pretty big and barely used for getting the accurate enemy position. A smaller, more basic map could take it's place innormal view that would provide the direction of allies and nearby spotted enemies. When you get a kill it shouldn't be showed in the middle of you screen, but your kill should be highlighted in the killfeed and stay for a while. The points you got from your kill could still come up where the where because it was rather satisfying to many people.

Leave your own opinions and suggestions about the HUD in the comments. 
Thanks for reading this wall of text.

1366836357.0,1d19ah,A few of my Ideas on BF4 (Longish),jimopl,18,3,7,"We all remember the Voice overs from the Alpha correct ""Be Advised there is a blah blah blah in the AO"" Well those sounded much more like soldiers than BF3s do with the whole ""im getting it pushed up my ass over here"" or whatever he says
My idea is that Normally the VO will sound much more like the Alphas did, and all around more professional, and then when suppressed even a little bit they get more like BF3s VO, showing more stress and the professionalism wears off and they sound all around more scared. We could also extend this to work in Ammo and health, if you have a good amount left its like ""I could use some ammo"" while if your out your screaming your head off at the guy.
Its not important in the long run but it would be a nice touch and also add variety in some sorts


Besides that I believe that the ""ammo"" Squad perk should not give you ammo. Rename it and instead have it give your squad Dual Magazines (if its a magazine fed weapon) or Extended mags if its not a mag fed weapon. I say this because that perk makes the support class less useful


Customizatable HUD, its size, color, pretty much everything. If you want to remake the HUD like CoD, do it, Want a BF2ish HUD, Do it. You can choose minimap type like on PC right now why not expand it for this type of thing.
Of course there would be presets but a full customization option as well.


Every jet has the possibility to become a 2 seater, the F-18 has a 2 seater varient (F/A-18F as oppossed to the F/A-18E) as does the A-10 (YA-10B) and Im sure we could figure out things for the RU jets.(first off I decided to overhaul the vehicle attachment systems, Defacto jets have flares and an airrader (which needs to show missles on it!) &amp; an IFF indicator on the HUD and can choose any other 2 attachments)
So the Pilot would select the second seat attachment and anything else (so like missles, ecm, etc...) Then a second person can get in the jet and the second seat can control more weapons that he may select (like JDAM, more Missles, etc...but not flares or anything of that sort)


All Class Equipment is an idea Ive been toying with as well. Essentially its what it sounds like, 1 all kit. Ideas Ive had are: Parachute (default one, can be like BF3s) Grappling Hooks,NVGs, Tripods (can place LMGs on them and they get extra accurate),Binoculars (act like Bf 1242s/BF4s), 1 Flashbang (only 1 cant be regained), Claymores (hand detonated only like IRL


Vehicle Disabling is area specific
Also different tanks get disabled easier/ harder than others, which it does IRL)
Although disabling is back


Small and Large medkits/ammo packs. the small ones are very similar to BF2s packs and function in the same way (they dont have to be put down,False,self,t5_2uie9,False,,,t3_1d19ah
