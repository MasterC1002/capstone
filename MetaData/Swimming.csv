1357718394.0,168m6r,The Most Common Freestyle/Front Crawl Errors I see at all levels and what can be done to correct them.,spartanKid,193,16,39,"I'll preface this as saying

I will, this is just a habit that will never die.

The freestyle is generally broken down into phases: Entry, and the Recovery. The entry is when the hands are entering the water out front, extending and reaching. Then the Catch happens when the forearm and hand drop and anchor on to the water. The Pull/Power phase is when the lats really engage and accelerate the body. The Recovery is when the hands have reached the hips and are done pulling and are raised out of the water to begin the cycle over.

**1) Rotation:**

Early on in the instruction of children and new swimmers, to the shoulder rotation of the freestyle. In fact, more attention should be focused on the hips and full body rotation. Swimming is a full body activity, and every stroke requires rhythmic motions of the entire body. Novice swimmers often focus on just rotating the shoulders, while leaving the hips relatively stationary. This is incorrect and inefficient. The proper freestyle technique is that in which the entire body rolls side-to-side, the rotation of which is being lead and driven by the hips, abdominals and lower back. Think of your entire body being on a roasting spit like a pig. You will then rotate about this long axis as you make your way down the pool.

Here is a video of Ian Thorpe (greatest 200/400/800m swimmer ever) swimming: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv_sDYHYzFw

Notice how his hips and shoulders rotate together. His whole body smoothly transfers momentum from side-to-side as he swims forward. The ideal freestyle would evenly rotate to each side, especially when trying to breathe. Even the world's best swimmers have a dominant side. That is OK. 

Notice also how Thorpe is looking forward and down while he swims. He's looking at about a 30-45 degree angle forward

**2) Dropping the Elbow in the Catch**

In freestyle as well as the other three competitive strokes

The key to using the entire forearm and hand as a paddle is to minimize wrist flexion and maintain a ""high elbow"" pull. A proper high elbow pull looks like this:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6qIhkuzTx0

Here, demonstrates an EXCELLENT high elbow pull. Once his arm goes out front of his body, his elbow stays at the surface of the water while he lowers his forearm and hand into the water and anchors it in place. He then pulls his body past that anchored forearm and accelerates down the pool. Notice how this pull also ties in nicely with the rotation of the hips. When his arm is in the water anchored and pulling, that same side hip is rotating up as the arm pulls back. The pulling motion and hip rotation are inherently entangled. Hackett is always pulling with his forearm and hand leading the motion, he never drops his elbow or leads the pull with his elbow first. 

Maintaining a high elbow pull recruits more of the lats and upper back

This video
http://www.floswimming.org/coverage/234221-Technique-Tuesday/video/174628-Meat-Hook-Freestyle

In the video he also mentions sculling out and kind of waivering back and forth with the arm out front. This is just coasting and wasted effort that is delaying the pull. This is also a good time to bring up the good old ""S"" curve patterned freestyle. Years ago, if viewed from the frame of reference of stationary, non-rotating hips, it would look like an S pull. BUT YOUR HIPS ROTATE, so just pull straight back, keeping that elbow above the hand and wrist. 

**3) Breathing:**

The freestyle breath is often over looked. Lots of people think that you just turn your head, make sure you aren't really laying on the elbow and pressing outward when you breath. Most often people really LAY on opposite arm when the breath, sort of pressing down and out with their arm as one fixed lever. This places lots of extra stress on shoulder and elbow. A high elbow pull is possible when breathing and not, it will just take some practice. 

Listen/watch this video about the breath: http://www.floswimming.org/coverage/234221-technique-tuesday/video/99220-the-freestyle-breath

Many people also like to LIFT their head out of the water to breath, to get all the air you need. The head can stay in line with the body, at that 30-45 degree angle forward, but just rotated to the side. The wake created by the head creates a pocket of low water behind it, allowing you to breath. 

Erik Vendt, and generally tough event swimmers has a pretty good breath technique here: http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Swimming+Olympic+Team+Trials+Day+8+0Eim5do-EGvl.jpg

**4) Hands**

I brought this up a little before, this isn't necessary and will almost certainly lead to hand cramps. Instead let you hands relax. Don't spread your fingers out but don't smash them together either. 

When your hands are entering the water out front of you

The other common thing is what was mentioned in the meat hook video. The tendency to have the hands kind of wander and wiggle around out front after they entry but before the catch. This only delays the catch and leads to gliding and coasting instead of constant propulsion down the pool. 


**5) Recovery Phase**

The recovery phase is the part of the stroke most people see from the deck and what many people base their opinions about ""smooth"" swimming on. 

The recovery phase should begin once the hand has reached the hip/waist area of the (maybe 3-4 inches below the hip bones). Once the hand has reached that level

Watch this video of Phelps: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax77_hHq9Dc&amp;t=1m15s

His elbows start the recovery and begin to come out of the water once his hands reach his suit/waist area. He isn't locking out his elbow to finish the pull and he isn't flicking his hands and wrist. He then extends and drops his wrists forward to start the entry and catch of the next cycle. Watch the video from the start to see him really put many of these points together well. 

One of the very common sightings recently has been the straight arm or windmill freestyle recovery. Unless you're an advanced competitive swimmer

**Conclusion**

I really hope this has all been informative and helpful. While it seems great to try and make all of these changes and tweaks all at once I strongly advise against it. Making stroke changes takes lots of time

I was diagnosed with cancer back in 2009.  I was 1 month from getting married and it just pretty much devastated me.  Anyway

After 6 months of chemo, I actually gained weight on chemo.  Went up to 244.  I kept eating because it made me feel better.  Coupled with the fact that now I had a thyroid shot because of radiation (I had a lymph node in my neck that needed to be radiated and it also hit the thyroid)  I was up to 256 by December 2012.  I went on a vacation and sitting down I popped a button of my size 42 pants.  That was the final straw.  I decided to do something about it.

Back when I was in the Navy

I made a goal then to at least get a mile, my lungs ached from the scar tissue and I was having trouble doing any type of stroke) with the understanding that I would work my way towards all freestyle.  So after about a month, I moved to 7 laps free, 7 laps breast and alternated each 7 laps (why 7?  Because 70 lengths is 35 laps and I can count to 5 and 7 while swimming than I can to 70 and breaking up the stroke helped me keep count).  After I got around 50 minutes, I started to introduce free style into my breast stroke sections, I would do 7 free, 1 breast, 1 breast…until I did 7 and then do 7 free and so on.  That helped me get it around 44 minutes.  Which I stayed out forever.  Until 2 weeks ago when I dropped down to 41.  THEN today I did my first sub-40 minute mile.  Now I still have lots of work to do

TL:DR- I had cancer that stopped me from being able to fully swim

&gt; Swimming, American swimmers don’t.  Why would anybody put themselves through this shit?

The training is dreadful and boring; you swim 2-4 hours per day 6 days per week and most of it is staring at a black line in the water and doing it in silence.   For no incentives.

When kicking:
 
* Keep toes pointed like a ballerina.

* Try not to bend your knees and keep your entire leg relatively straight.

* Keep your butt above water.

* Try to practice with a kick board if available.

* Try and have JUST your ankles and the heel/sole of your foot come out of the water

Arms: 

* Extend your arms

* Keep your fingers closed

* Elbows should be nice and high

Breathing: 

* Every breath you take try and have either your right ear and cheek in the water

* Try and count how many strokes you will do before your next breath. I recommend doing every 3 or 5 arm strokes (mostly 3) this is so you can work on Bi-lateral breathing

* Breathing on one side is considered a bad habit and can put you at a disadvantage


Misc.: 
* Try to swim with a friend.

* Only swim if a life guard is present.

* Try and have a set plan before you go swim.

* Its okay to have people critique you while you are swimming.

* Everytime you go to the pool

* Try and sign up for lessons with a swim teacher. Many cities have free lessons. Personally

* Always have a checklist in your head while swimming, if your arm is extended, etc. 

* Try not to be lazy or build on bad habits. 

* Drinking water

* Be cool in the pool. 

* Oh don't pee in the pool

I have always enjoyed the water but never swam in school as I was not good enough. The most competitive swimming I have ever done was when I was 15 in boarding school

I learned how to swim when I was 6 in aftercare when I followed the older boys into jumping into the deep end and started drowning before the aftercare teacher jumped in and yanked me out. I then spend most of my free time after school at the Yeoville swimming pool teaching myself how to swim.

Last year, Vietnam having a beer with a British guy looking out into the sea and decided to go swim to touch a protruding limestone rock mass. It was a 1,5 kilometer swim there-and-back and I enjoyed it, open-water long distance swimming has always been meditative for me: Focus on strokes, breathing and my mind just goes empty (I had casually swam in university and did about 1,5 km every session).

When I returned home in October I wanted to swim

Answer 1: Become an Olympic swimmer. 

To do this get a time machine and go back to ages 8 to 10. Start swimming and join a club, later twice a day, later 4 to 6 hours a day. Add some weights. Watch your diet, cut out junk food, get a nutritionist and a coach. There's not much to it.

Answer 2: Go swimming. Enjoy it for itself, fitness and health. Make friends you can trust. These aspects will last you a lifetime, your momentary obsession with looks will pass.

* **I want to get back to/start swimming. What do I do?**

Answer: See the sidebar. Use the Zero to 1500 plan. Swimming is *hard*. Don't get discouraged but keep at it. Don't let the Speedoes fool you

Also in the sidebar? Drills! Do them. And join a club

* **Am I too old?**

Answer 1: To swim, especially Master's. Swimming brings health, fitness, and not least camaraderie with like minded individuals. Or swim open water, when people stay competitive until their 70s.

Answer 2: To become an Olympic or National level swimmer, you won't know until you try. Get out there and swim.

* **How do I get faster?**

Answer: Listen to your coach. They are the ones who see you regularly. If you don't have a coach,,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,True

I got there, somehow it doesn't suit the exercises she has to do. So this girl and I decide to share the side of the lane and take turns doing hundreds. Not ideal but fine. The other girl gets out a short time later and another girl asks if I mind sharing. No one else has gotten out so I say sure and we continue with the same set up as before.

Eventually old lady loses it and abuses the new girl saying she had no right to get in this lane when there were two others she could have chosen (which both still had the same set up).

* Fourth: Questions are encouraged

***

**Care to share some pics? Current

Since I want to remain anonymous

**Age?** 23 **Sex?** Female

**What sports or fitness activities are you involved in?** 

I swim. I swim a lot. And I do a bunch of cross-training such as different kinds of cardio (running, dryland (medballs, jumps, swiss ball, squats) and weights. I have been competing for about 15 years, started in a summer-only swim team and have now been on the international level for 7 years!

**What’s your story? When

Well, 7 and then 8 times a week by 15 years old. My best friends were at the pool, we knew all the swimmers in our province, it was a very social thing. At about 15 I started winning more meets, making teams, traveling a lot more and it took over many aspects of my life like school, friends and other hobbies. Swimming is my lifestyle

**Do you want to share any athletic or fitness-related goals

As I said, oh how I miss the full-body suits!

**What is your training regimen?** 

I have been on a varsity team for the last four years (my last varsity season just ended ☹). We swim 8-9 times a week for 2 hours, I work with a strength and conditioning coach in dryland twice a week for an hour, that’s where we’ll work on power; lots of clean and jerk, jumps, medball throws, kick boxing. It changes every week, and I absolutely love it!

**What does your diet look like? Do you take any supplements?** 

I am obsessed with food. Not in a healthy way. I have a self-imposed diet that I follow more or less depending on how close to a meet I am. Lots and lots of forbidden food: pasta, rice, cheese, any sweets (chocolate, sugar, pastries, muffins, juice, any cream

But I also contradict myself a lot in the sense that I love eating out, yams and home-made granola. I eat around 2,000 calories per day.

As for supplements, sodium bicarbonate (to buffer acid lactic) and it would make me bloated, nauseous and it’s just really really uncomfortable to take 36 pills of baking soda every day.

One thing I want to add for those as anal as me when it comes to food: it’s a mistake. Going in to World Championship a couple of years ago, exhausted, depressed and I injured myself really badly. I wasn’t able to train well at all, competing poorly and I was miserable. I have a huge issue with control and body image, but I have learned the hard way that in my sport, in ANY sport/fitness activity, you don’t win medals for being thin, won’t kill ya!

**What have you achieved so far? What are your ‘numbers’ (times

This is really fun but I’d rather not say too much :P

**What is your competition and/or training philosophy? What challenges do you face?** 

My training philosophy: go go go. Coaches and other athletes see me as the hard worker, I am a nerve wreck. I used to have tears in my eyes before my races and I still shake like a leaf on the starting block. But I love that feeling. I build my confidence from my training and think of key words before and during the race. I just get into the zone!

The biggest challenge that I face is dealing with my bodily responses to stress. A week or two before a meet I’ll have stomach cramps

**How do you motivate yourself?** 

A lot of it is being part of a team and immense respect for my coach. I also have a strong will to “redeem” myself from failures I have experienced in the past, I think it’s ok to do it.

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and that of your SO/friends/co-workers?** 

My dad does not approve of my priorities, that’s not cool. As for my friends, they ask questions and they are interested and they support me, they try their best to understand. Also I tend to listen to them more than I talk, my best friends are not swimmers and it’s nice to get out of this world once in a while! I find it difficult to make non-swimmer friends in college though. Mostly because I do not get hammered during the week, or ever on an Olympic year, and I go to bed at 10pm every night. Loser

I am not involved in school whatsoever because I spend so much time at the pool and I wish I had more time to really experience the whole college life. And I have always dated swimmers. Now I know better!! It’s hard to maintain a good relationship with a non-athlete though

People my age generally don’t have quite the same lifestyle as mine! 

**How do you work on mental strength?** 

I believe that mental strength is at least
It’s arrogance and it’s fear. You have to have the confidence to know that you are going to do well but not underestimate your opponent. You have to want it bad enough to stay motivated during training, but also expectations from my team mates, my coaches and the national team. I love it and I hate it. I love it when I get to race and do well, when I am ready and confident. I hate it when I just want to hide and do my own thing, when I need to learn, when I need to make mistakes.

When I feel like I can’t cope with the stress, and a detailed plan to get there. It is an absolutely amazing feeling to go after something so important to me. Maybe it will never happen again in my life!

It's a good read. You can buy it off Amazon or Kobo for $16 or so.

""Tony"" was an excellent swimmer, this went beyond a single tip in passing though. He tried to run a practice within my practice just to get out of doing a ""hard"" set. 

After weeks of breaking this habit

When this attitude started spreading I changed my approach. I pulled each swimmer that missed more than 2 days in a row and put a choice to them: Commit to the team or walk. I said I was done hearing halfwitted excuses. Most of these swimmers were seniors and had college/graduation stuff to focus on and I simply said find a way to balance it or quit. Decisions were made

Tony avoided coming to practice to avoid the conversation. He appeared at practice the day before a meet. He had been gone for 4 practices. I asked him the same question I asked the others. Tony attempted to guilt trip me into keeping him on the team. Saying it was my choice whether he stays or goes never acknowledging it was his own actions that lead him here. After a few minutes of trying to encourage him to accept responsibility

Side Note: I also coached Tony for water polo this past season. Besides being a key player

Rule 2: Never get into an occupied land without letting the person/people already swimming know you are entering.Do this by dangling your legs into the water or standing to the side at the end of the lane when they are turning.

Rule 3: If there is only one other person in the lane

Rule 4: Once a third person joins

Rule 5: Circle swimming is dictated by the fastest person present, most ignorant or first in the lane. Take note of the swimmer's speeds before you enter. Direction is often pool specific. Check for direction signs or ask.

Rule 6: Tap feet to pass. The person whose feet are being tapped moves out of the way to the corner at the lane end. Do NOT speed up if you are being passed.

Rule 7: Move to the side to allow faster people to pass. Allow them to turn at the centre of the lane wall. if there are more than one

Rule 8: Do NOT turn or push off in front of faster swimmers. Faster swimmers should allow slower swimmers as much time as possible before starting.

Rule 9: Do NOT start swimming immediately behind another swimmer. They will not know you are there when they are turning. Injuries will result.

Rule 10: Swimmers resting at lane end should stay as far to the side of the lane as possible.

Rule 11: If the lane has a few swimmers doing long-axis strokes (front crawl

Rule 12: Be polite. Communicate. Do your best to explain the etiquette. Remember most lifeguards don't seem to know these. Most pools don't have them posted.

Edit:

Also:

Rule 13: Arm collisions occur. Live with it. If it seems to happen to you regularly

Rule 14: If there is a collision or accident

Rule 15: Cross the center line before you turn so you aren't pushing off into oncoming traffic.",self,t5_2r0po,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/mrw88/mainset_of_the_week_actually_its_probably/

3000 meters -  while I am not a Buddhist, I could sense every muscle fiber in my body working.  Every contraction and expansion of close to thirty muscles.  I found the following list of muscles used for the front crawl on www.swimtoslim.com:


Upper Limb:

Thenars, Biceps, Triceps, Deltoids


Neck:

Sternocleidomastoid


Front Trunk:

Pectorals, Rectus Abdominus

Pretty amazing if you ask me

Eventually my body was giving me signs of exhaustion. Cramping in my feet and shoulders let me know that it was time to quit. Make it back to the end. Stop my watch. Jump out of the pool

Walking back to the locker room, somebody else that was in the pool stopped me and asked where I swam in college. Considering that a year and a half ago I could barely make it 100 meters with out a rest, I took it as a well received compliment.

I saw the Water Snake post and had to share this.  This is a great game for any age level and is terrifically inclusive.  It takes minimum 2 lanes (more is better) and a good number of swimmers.  Here's how it works:

[A standard double knockout bracket is used.](http://www.printyourbrackets.com/)  Swimmers are seeded randomly.  The coach needs a list of all of the swimmers best times over a 50 (or 100).  You also need pair of dice.  Start with the first matchup.

1.  Each swimmer rolls a number.  1=Fly 2=Back 3=Breast 4=Free 5=Swimmer's Choice 6=Opponent's Choice
2.  Coach looks up the times for each swimmer and calculates the time difference.
3.  The coach starts the slower swimmer first.
4.  The coach starts the second swimmer second
5.  The first to touch the wall wins and advances until their is a champion.

As you can probably tell, but I've found that it often leads to people posting best times in their off events because it's advantageous much of the time to choose them.

I taught this to one of my coaches and he does it with his swimmers every second Friday now with a small prize at the end.  100% attendance almost every time.

The United States can wear them until June 3rd! After that the new mark 2's will be required. The times swam in the carbons will count as USA swims but they will not count for a FINA sanctioned meet or a world record. The only people that need to worry about that will be the people at Charlotte and Masters Nationals. But an Arena rep will be there with the new suits so it doesn't matter for them. Carbons will not be outright banned. They already have the mark 2's rolling off the line in full force and they are approved.


http://www.arenainternational.com/arena-waives-fina-approval-on-three-models-of-powerskin-carbon-pro_en_0_2_4875.html

Read that^ but they were banned due to a permeability issue. They are replacing all suits with the banned barcodes which is good since I have one of those. They are sending out directions for receiving a new suit that is not banned on may 13th. So it works out I guess. I get a brand new suit even though Ive worn my arena 10 times!

But Arena is trying to ""grandfather"" the suits so if you have a suit you can wear it until the new ones come out. That is not official yet,False,self,t5_2r0po,1367978498.0,,,t3_1dtizo

What stands out the most to me is when I started coaching. I inherited a team of 300 swimmers. It was a summer league team that had a ton of national level year round swimmers and the previous coaches focused on catering to them. When I came in as a coach, and one for those that didn't. Instead of focusing on winning City Meet, which my team had been close to winning for three years, I implemented a system of using my national level swimmers to help teach the summer league only swimmers proper technique. We focused on being a team, the training, and progress rather than results. 

In this process

We entered that meet favored to finish last, mostly through proper technique off the walls. They were executing perfect streamline and huge kicks. About halfway through the meet, we're a few points behind. It comes down to the relays at the end. Our 13-14 male and female kill it! Then comes the break before the 15-18 relay. The points are tallied and there are three teams which have chance of winning, one of which is ours. Our ladies lead off and have the swim of a lifetime and win. All we need is our males to finish third in order to win. 

They take off and are in an early lead. Second leg and our rivals are catching us. Then

We finished tied for second. It wasn't about the results, our team focused on the success. 

We took a group of casual swimmers and made a family. On top of that,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,t3_yajvj

This time I've added a T-30 option for the *sissies*.

Winner(s) will receive the Fancy Gold Trophy,750m. Last time there was no gender segregation, if there are enough this time, there will be. If we have enough entries, I may add other categories (stroke, age?). We might add some flair options.

For those for whom this is a new challenge:

* Honour system applies and rules all.
* During the month of November
* One stroke only for the time. You may stop. You may not dive.
* You can do it two more times in the month. (3 attempts total). It doesn't matter if you are swimming an hour every day. You mentally decide your attempt before you start. Not AFTER a particularly good day.
* No drafting off others. One lane, snorkles etc
* At the end of the month PM me your best distance for the times of the three attempts. I'll create a separate account for entries. 
* Include your stroke and the pool length (METRES ONLY
* At the start of December I'll post the results and we'll have a ranking.

Note: This isn't just for the fastest swimmers. 

Why would you do this?

* It's a good test of fitness and speed
* It will give you a measurement of improvement
* It is a great challenge for all levels
* Many will call it boring. That is part of the point. This is about finding out a little bit about yourself in distance events where the challenge is as much mental as physical.

* Last time we had suggestions for other options.There's still nothing stopping anyone organising something different. So it is what it is.

1368715976.0,1egbt6,Open Water Wednesday - How far can you swim?,TheGreatCthulhu,34,4,29,"With the Northern hemisphere open water season getting underway

A common question is some variation of:

&gt;*I want to swim 1.5k/3k/3k/10k

There are different answers for this depending on many factors:

1: What is your swimming experience?

2: What is you current swimming training?

3: What is your open water experience?

4: Wetsuit or not?

5: Sea

6: How long do you have to prepare?

Previous [Open Water Wednesdays](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/search?q=open+water+wednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on) have covered some of these questions, basic skills, swimming in different conditions.  

* To swim any significant distance in open water the first requirement is regular swimming every week. This seems obvious but some people seem to think it isn't necessary. For almost any distance from 1k up

* The second most important requirement, from different directions at different speeds in different weather conditions. Water conditions change dynamically, even during events. **You MUST get  experience beforehand**. You must practice your skills, especially sighting and navigation, but also pack swimming, rough water, fear

* **A wetsuit is NOT A SAFETY AID**. Many experienced open water swimmers feel very strongly that people substitute wetsuits for training and experience. One of the most frightening videos I've ever seen of this was 2012's [Escape From Alcatraz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=smX3YKyYvHw). Watch it. Experienced open water swimmers view this video with genuine horror at the ineptitude on display both of swimmers and safety crew and logically therefore of the organisation. Because this isn't a really rough day by OW standards. 

**YOU CANNOT SUBSTITUTE A WETSUIT FOR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE.** 

Just because an event allows you to enter with your limited experience means nothing. They just want your money. Events which have real qualifications requirement are not elitist. They are experienced and aware of the dangers. They are the *good events*. (Seek them out).

* You cannot safely swim 1k this week, in a month you will be swimming  barely over 6000m. You can prove me wrong, maybe, in the short term, but in the long term to do otherwise will lead to inevitable injury.


***BUT HOW MUCH DO I NEED TO TRAIN?***

There is no simple answer. However...

Endurance swimmers and athletes have a few rules of thumb:

*  *You can swim in a day what you swim in a week*. 

This is a reasonable guideline for medium to longer distances. I find it is most used from about 20k to 45k distances. If you are swimming these distances then you likely have your own opinion and may disagree with me. This is absolutely fine

This rule breaks down at the lower end. If want to swim 1k open water

*  *You can swim 4 times longer than your longest training swim FOR ONE-OFF EVENTS*. 

This is a very old rule. The last part means that doing this in the absence of regualar training means injury is more likely. You may get through it on grit but you won't do it regualarly.

So

*Open water requires training

I hope this helps some of you. Have a great season! And remember: **Safety Always!**

Here is where I mention that I'm 5'3"" and female. I am also the proud owner of a 2:17 200m IM, I obviously know what I'm doing: my ""slow"" pace is realistically quite fast due to a background in aerobic training. Lastly, I pride myself on lane etiquette and giving way to those who are training faster than I am. They're not difficult to spot. They're the people who catch you up.

My lane partner this morning, I caught him. He seemed surprised, wavering and thrashing on the wall in confusion, and he let me past. That was fine.

A few minutes later, he pushed off right next to me and sprinted, forcing me into the path of incoming traffic. Luckily, our one other lane partner had just gotten out, otherwise there could have been a collision.

Thrashed like an old thrashing thing as we went up the pool. Experienced Swimmitors will know that all it takes is a cheeky gear change from 3rd to 4th and you leave someone like that behind, resting for a short time before taking off right behind me again and sprinting until he could sprint no more (another three lengths).

Shortly afterwards, but by the look on his face and his mean glare that was trained on me, it was definitely not polite. He got out then, storming off the pool deck and into the locker room. I half expected him to slip on the wet steps, he was stamping down them so hard. He'd been in the pool for the grand total of about ten minutes.

I know I'm small. I know I'm female. But are some men's egos really that sensitive that it infuriates you to be passed by a woman? My size inclusive

I do *not* think I deserve to receive muttered insults and evil glares because I can swim well. It's not the first time something like this has happened, by a man who couldn't keep up with me. I did laugh, even though that sort of anger is a bit scary.

Please tell me I'm not the only one who this happens to

this time back, i did that. and then three swims later (today), i just kept going until i hit a mile. i jumped out of the pool 40 minutes later feeling great.

honestly i've read about technique and everything on here, effort, breath, etc. that are allowing me to keep going without breaks.

1. Works in any pool
2. The lanelines need to be removed.
3. One swimmer starts as the ""head of the snake"".
4. The remaining swimmers should remain on deck.
5. One swimmer is called by the coach to act as ""food"".  They jump into the pool
6. ""Food"" must remain stationary
7. The ""head"" swims to eat the ""food"".  The ""head"" can only move in 90 degree angles.  
8. The ""food"" is swallowed
9. The ""food"" then becomes the ""tail"" of the snake.  
10. Steps 5-9 are repeated until no ""food"" remains. 
11. The last ""food"" eaten becomes the  ""head"" for the next round.
12. Repeat until all swimmers have been the ""head"" of the snake.

I'm not hungover her or anything

Why I'm writing this? Well

The assisant coach we have on our team is named, no big deal normally. 1 thing to know about SD is that he has this weird fetish with leading, like he has to lead no matter what, even if someone else is faster. If you pass him, he'll get pissed and send his watchdog, the AC on you.

But all of the sudden SD got annoying. So I tried to stay away from him, but try spending 27 hours a week with a guy you dont like for 6 months. Eventually SD realizes I cant stand him, so he starts to hate me. Still no big deal, I can handle myself in a situation quite well. He knows that so he changes his tactics. He turns AC against me. 

She wont do anything positive to me anymore. We were doing 75s Kick, but SD doesnt like that cause now hes going 3rd. So you know what the prick screams? He yells, ""AC! THEYRE BEING ASSHOLES!"" So she stops us and asks what were doing. We tell her the time was too slow and we kicked the time down so we would be better. She pulls us out of the water and scolds us. Then she asks why we don't respect her. We don't but we still tried to tell her that we do. After 15 minues of that she asks us again. So I said ""because you do shit like this"". Ya that one ended well.

So here we go. We now have an all out war between the corrupt AC/SD and the captain/breaststroke. And both of the teams are fighting for the a
Support of the rest of the team. Suprisingly

So AC and SD now realize that I was elected captain for a reason and they learn they can't take me down, he responds with a simple ""it was a joke whatever"". 

By this point everyones fed up with SD, SD is a Junior and wants captain next year. The team (without my influence I promise) decided they dont want to elect him next year lol) 

Here I are now, thats fucked up. Ill repeat for emphazise. My assistant coach doesnt want me to succeed. 

I want to tell new swimmers that it gets better, but in reality its done wonders for my character. I'm always happy, I always seeing the good side of stuff even when the worst shit happens, but lately ive been wondering if the now 5000 hours I have put into swimming was worth it. After getting this rant out of my system, I'd say yes. If I had to say a moral to this story it would be this:

1294333604.0,exc0x,The Flip Turn,broken_hand,26,2,22,"I noticed a lot of new people to r/swimming and I haven't seen any post explaining the flip turn. I will try to explain it the best I can and hopefully others will add to this.

Why do the flip turn?
The main reason is that you can swim much faster using this method versus a wall touch or grab. I however, I am not tempted to stop on the walls as much and it doesn't afford me that ever so slight break that grabbing the wall does. I find it also helps with interval/ set workouts since I am able to be more consistent w/ respect to time using a flip turn, whereas my time w/ a wall touch can vary to the point where I am unsure if I am swimming faster or performing a faster turn.

How to preform the flip turn?
While looking for videos explaining how to do this I came across a goswim series.

[part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFQpLyihI5M)
[part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryN-4R1E8d8)
[part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHXNBbLFiJs)
[part 4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQh2SqA2Ck)
[part 5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss6-htcF9mA)

These videos are excellent
 
When I was learning the most difficult part for me was the somersault. Once I had that down I could preform the w/ almost no additional instruction. In order to master the somersault my coach had us the team swim a set were we had to somersault three times each length. It was very awkward but it helped teach my muscles what to do.
To do a somersault while swimming

[Short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK9mm39uHZ8)

Use which ever method you works best for you. I recommend the goswim videos. Remember its an awkward movement at first



**Edit**

**floor markings**

I forget to mention the lane markings, without having to look up at the wall. To use them being the turn when you are passing over them. You will have to experiment with this to find the sweet spot. Remember this spot will change depending on how fast you swim and how tight you make your tuck. (if you flip to late you can always tuck tighter).

**Backstroke**

Also

**tricks**

* If you get water up your nose while you are spinning upside down, just a steady stream. If you struggle with this then as the video suggests you can try a nose clip. (I have no experience with these, so I can't speak to their usefulness)

* to help get the rotation/spin, try to find an underwater shot. So as you see your head naturally goes toward your hands. What you want to do is then imagine that you are using your hands to splash water in your face. If done correctly this will also help you set up for your stream line off the push. However you want to remember that your abs should be doing the work - like the instructional video said - but this could help beginners and those looking to speed up their turns.
See [spartanKid](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/exc0x/the_flip_turn/c1bqlzr) and [enderx475](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/exc0x/the_flip_turn/c1bpu97) comments' for different explanations.

* Once you have the basics mastered, you should be doing these fast. 


**Edit 2**

I have been and will continue to update the tricks and body of this post without using the traditional format of multiple edits. By doing this I hope that it will be easier for new readers to understand the message.

1354805300.0,14dv79,[WOD]The Red Mist (endurance threshold),TheGreatCthulhu,31,6,5,"This set originally comes from Paul Newsome (swimsmooth) and is designed to increase your threshold swim speed for endurance and distance swimming. 

Simply it's descending 400s:

* 4x 400m at threshold pace + 6 sec /100m
* 3x 400m at threshold pace + 5 sec /100m
* 2x 400m at threshold pace + 4 sec /100m
* 1x 400m at threshold pace + 3 sec /100m

Take 20 secs rest after *every* 400.

So you need to know your threshold speed. 

How do you measure your threshold pace?

You need to do a 400m and 200m time trial. Do the 400 first as it is less likely to interfere with the 200. Take plenty of rest inbetween.

Threshold is calculated first in meters per second by this formula

(m/sec) = (400 - 200) / (T400 - T200)

where T400 &amp; T200 are the 400 &amp; 200 times in seconds.
Then divide 100 by your m/sec result and you have your threshold speed per 100m in seconds. (It's very easy to plug into a spreadsheet

  
For example: 

if your 400 time is 7 minutes and your 200 time is 3.30, which is 1 min 45 secs per 100 threshold speed. (Round up to full seconds).

Then for each set

This set will see you decreasing time, but coming in on or close to the time.

Important: Retest your threshold speed every 4 weeks

1344172048.0,xpokz,Looking Back At This Past Week,God_Wills_It_,26,2,30,"Hey Swimmit!

First off I want to say hi to all the new subscribers that have popped up because of the Olympics.  I hope you stick around.  Second I want to say give a big THANKS! to the mods for keeping spoilers off the front page and for all the work you have done over the past months getting this sub back up and active.

But I wanted to take the time to look back on what we just experienced and get your opinions on what you expected or are looking forward to in the next few years.

**Phelps**

I hope everyone enjoyed what they witnessed in London.  I know I sure did.  Michael changed our sport forever.  It will never be the same and we owe him the biggest thanks.  If you want to say thanks I think the best way would be to donate what you can to [The Michael Phelps Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/MichaelPhelpsFoundation) which promotes the sport of swimming amoung young people.  

**Lochte**

I think given the expectations many people will say that this was a disappointing meet for Lochte despite bringing home multiple medals.  To me the only real disappointment was his 3rd place in the 200 Back.  But I'm curious to see what the rest of swimmit thinks.

**The Next Generation**

Despite losing Phelps we as Swimfans have a lot to look forward to.  With the rise of Franklin, Ye Shiwen, le Clos, Meilutyte &amp; others we see a changing of the guard.  I can't wait to see how far these swimmers can go to set new WRs over the next few World Championships and in Rio.  **Who is swimmit pulling for over the next 4 years?**

**WRs

There were 9 WRs in the 32 events in London.  That was a lot more that I expected.  I expected maybe 1 or 2.  I'm curious as to what swimmit thought was going to happen before the games and how they feel now.  I think we have to admit to ourselves that the suits had less of an effect than we thought.  (At least in longer events).  It really is the increased training and improved techniques that have driven swimming forward over the last decade.  3 of the 9 records in London came in 100-meter events,500 (And a just miss in the 800).  I just did a quick count in my head so let me know if I missed or added one.  Makes me very excited for the next few years.

As for the doping allegations against the young swimmers Ye Shiwen &amp; Ledecky.  I'll admit that I was skeptical after the first night and Ye Shiwen's smashing of a suited record.  But after seeing that the suited records aren't nearly as untouchable as I expected I accept that all those swimmers that participated in London are clean.  They are until it's proven otherwise.  But it is a part of modern athletics.  All modern athletes will have to deal with it.  It think it's best dealt with with things like Project Believe

**Just a few more questions for swimmit**

**What for you was the best story of these Olympics?**

I hope to get lots of different answers for this but for me it involved Phelps.  But not him getting the most medals or finishing as the best swimmer ever.  It involves his loss in the 200 Fly.  I love the fact that le Clos has been inspired by Phelps for almost a decade and all he wanted was to be in the same pool as his idol.  Not only did he get that chance but he chased down his hero to out touch him on the last stroke of the last swim in Phelps' best event.  And then watching him barely hold it together for the interview was amazing.  You can't make up a better Olympic story.  

**Possible Changes for future Olympics?**

If I were in charge I would add a 4x200 Mixed Freestyle Relay.  2 men &amp; 2 women swimming 100 free.  I would also have both men and women swim both the 800 free and the 1500.  There is no reason that they shouldn't both swim both events.  There are world records in the men's 800 and women's 1500.  Just swim the 800 on the first day and the 1500 on the last.  Give the distance swimmers a chance to recover and have more than one event.  What does swimmit think?

**Biggest disappointment in the 2012 Olympics?**

For me it was the U.S. coaches.  I don't think they did a very good job on either 400 Free relay.  Small nitpicking but that's what it was for me.  What about you swimmit?  

**Tl;DR  I'm a huge swimming nerd.  I would appreciate it if you would answer some of the questions in bold and give me your opinions.**",self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/xpokz/looking_back_at_this_past_week/

So pathetic

I have lots of advice for new swimmers (although not all of it may be good).  


---------

 * Ze goggles

 * Drag force is massive. You can't get very far with poor form in this sport (unlike cycling or running) 

 * Good form comes with practice and feedback.  Biggest thing to remember is that you want your body to flow through the same segment your head and arms passed through. I'm not going to explain form any further since I still suck at it [watch videos instead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2n_AceCr-c)

 * That burning your nose gets will when water enters it will go away. Maybe after about a few weeks of swimming. 

 * Don't bother purchasing jammers for a while. Just swim in whatever you like. Consider it a ['drag suit'](https://www.google.com/search?q=swimming+drag+suit&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fjH-T43eE8LJ6wHH4Z3JBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=890). My triathon captain would often wear a drag suit. My swimsuit had about 3 times the drag factor

 * Getting down breathing takes a while

 * You can use your whole arm to pull yourself through the water

 * swimming  in a straight line is hard

 * I don't wear swimcaps (yet). takes too long to put on and pulls on your hair

1307886354.0,hxrfz,Nightswimming,TheGreatCthulhu,24,5,20,"It was my first night swim since the EC. Like many sea swimmers I love night-swimming. Just after midnight on Sunday morning

The water had been cold on my stretch of coast all week

We all arrived around 11.30pm. The long northern latitude twilight had finally bowed to night

I live the furthest away, though compared with others, it's a small number, with some of them having over five hundred or a thousand laps done, over many years. (After my next lap I'm a member of the 100 Club).

I was sure The Queen had done night laps before, even during her overnight training swim, (the only one of us ever to have a done a full night swim ... in training). It seemed it had never been done. This island scares some people in the daytime.


This night swim was different to the usual annual training event which happens inside the island. This was around the outside of the island in full dark. The wind was coming up and instead of south westerly

This was also special. Night-swimming, The Bull, The Yank and others, and a few people I didn't know. Missing however were other friends, two of them now on the other side side of the world. 

Night-swimming in one of the world's great swimming locations. What more could a swimmer want? (Warm water

The Yank gave a safety briefing. We were divided into three groups so we would be finishing roughly together, I with green.

We entered the water just after midnight. The people who'd never done a real night swim were given a minute or two to see if they felt okay. At the last minute The Yank decided we all needed a nightmare and decided to forego his togs. I shudder still. But I understand the motivation.

Even the colder water at the slipway felt a bit warmer than home, took off after the two first slower groups and the Hun and I followed last.

I know from talking to people that many are horrified at the thoughts of anything touching them underwater. I imagine the thought of it happening in complete blackness is worse

We stopped at the first corner, eyes were adjusting from the glare of the car light at the slipway so it seemed particularly dark at the start.

At the first corner we could feel the growing chop from the wind

We swam to the second corner, for once.

The moon was hidden in clouds behind us. The world consisted of only a few colours. The neon greens


And in the void was one of the reasons we love night swimming

We hit occasional kelp. The Hun hit a buoy on the inside of the island and I hit ropes twice causing us both to laugh. The last hundred metres to the slipway was the usual hammer of cold water from the stream outflow. I didn't even see the one boat I knew was moored outside the slipway. 

I've swam for hours in the dark. There is something zenlike about it. It is utterly exhilarating and calming at the same time. This was only thirty minutes of heaven.

It's been a cold week in Ireland, leaving us all much colder after a mere thirty minutes than we would normally be in mid June.

Basics about me:  I'm not fast, so the turn isn't a great concern, but my endurance is.

Problem:  Sometimes I can get in the pool and get a mile+ in no problem, I find my heart rate climbing after 400m and I begin to get out of breath.  I try to pace myself and calm down, but usually to no avail.  I end up taking a 20 second break and then going back at it.  And after I do this I'm usually good for the remainder of whatever distance I am swimming that session.

So it seems I'm just starting at too hard of a pace, which is something I really want to avoid.  Endurance and fitness don't *seem* to be the issue, it's just that beginning of the swim which is a roll of the dice for me.

During that final 4 x 100 relay, something was discovered (this is where my second-hand, not first-hand information starts, as I left the pool once it was announced that we had won). The coach of the team had forgotten to update the relay order card for the 4 x 100 relay. The order for prelims and finals does not have to be the same, so we swam a couple different girls in each race, a completely legal action, however a form must be submitted documenting the changes. Since the form was not submitted, the forty points awarded for first place were removed

Because of this, and no further recognition was given to our high school.

Back at the school, there were no insults or hard feelings directed at the coach by parents or students. He was new last year, and had helped move them from a team that barely placed at state to a runner up team last year and now a championship winning team. The only thing they didn't have was the title, stripped from them by a simple clerical error that really should have been reviewed by at least some official or assistant before the meet even started.

Base your intervals at your own pace. I will be having my swimmer hold a golf ball on the 50 drill for every 100 in this set. The idea is to get him using his forearm to pull water. I am really focusing on the first third of the pull and the last third. A lot of people (on the first 1/3 of the pull) pull straight down- causing the body to pop up &amp; on the last 1/3 of the pull- people pull straight up (body drives down). This cycle can be vicious when both arms are constantly doing this. 

*focus on finishing your pull past your suit/hip. Extend your elbow after every pull to the point where your triceps are getting tired. That is a sign you are pulling a lot more water with every pull (you should feel more of a boost if done properly)*

My name is Ryan and I've been in love with swimming ever since I was born. I was also born with a hearth problem and as such, but even afterwards, the only sport I loved enough to continue was swimming.

It is only recently (a month or two ago) that I made a point of it to go swimming 3 times a week. I'm currently at 1 km in about half an hour

Since I can't do front crawl, blocks that you could between your legs and so on. And I realised that maybe I could get more out of my weekly swims by switching it up a bit.

(TL;DR:) So my question is, swims 1 km in about half an hour without any big problems but who also wants to strengthen his muscles and get some endurance, what could be a good way to proceed? I can always use hand paddles, fins, etc. and I can also pay for a teacher to teach me front crawl if that would be a good idea.

Thanks for the help!

A bit of background: I took swimming lessons at age 6 or 7 and learned the stroke basics, and my endurance is okay(I have been mainly focusing on fly lately, and I can do 200s but I need about a minute rest between sets of 200s). 

So

-Do you have any workouts or workout ideas(in or out of the pool) that you think would help prepare me for the intensity of the workouts that I will have to do on the team?(Currently I get swim workouts off the internet, yesterday I did a set of 10 x 100s @ 2:00 where the first 50 was fly and the 2nd free. I made the interval every time, but it was nearly a continuous swim(I had 3-8 seconds rest after every one) and I was exhausted afterwards, but I did complete it. Another set that really tired me out was a set of 20 x 50s @ 1:00 alt free/back.

-Do you have any tips or advice so I don't look like a complete fool? Things like swim etiquette, etc.  I will obviously be the 'new kid', and I don't want to be that newbie who does everything that all the other swimmers have known not to do for years! 

If you want any more information, etc., to help answer any of these, let me know.

Thank you so much for reading/responding!",self,t5_2r0po,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/1eb5mg/joining_high_school_swim_team_for_the_first_time/

So I decided to do the 100*100 workout today and just kind of went for it with no prep.  Ended up losing gas hard at 65 and stopped at 70 and I think it's because I didn't prepare (and maybe not in the best of shape). So some questions for anyone who has done it: Do people swim right through or take a break every 20 or 30 sets?  Do you sip a mouthful of water every once in a while or just wait until a break?  Do you eat before?  Do you even eat during (a bar or something if you get out to take a break).

The week (for me) was approximately 100k in 8 days in open water topped off by a 6 hour qualifying swim (to qualify to swim the channel) in ~52f water

Probably the worst part was hour one because I was cold

I fed every 25-30 mins ago thanks to volunteers with bottles of Maxim or Perpetuem on hand.  About 3 hours in a seal popped up next to me and scared the shit out of me.  There had been reports of seals biting in the area so I yelled at him, I splashed a seal, I could just see him laughing at me) but he swam away.  The adrenaline that he gave me got me through the fourth hour.  Then there were two hours left and I knew I would finish.  

I had been acclimatizing for months now and although it was cold

These are useful if you get a copy of someone’s plan or find some on the ‘net

* So

**FR** or **f/s** or **f/c**: Front crawl 

**BK** or **b/c** : Backstroke

**BR** or **b/s** : Breaststroke

**fly** or **FL**: Butterfly

**IM** : Individual Medley, b/s, f/c in that order

**kk** or **kick**: kick only

**pull**: swim using a pullbuoy between the legs

**Pad/paddles** : Use paddles on the hands

**Pull &amp; pad** : Use both pullbuoy and paddles

**UW** Underwater

* Some other common terms-

**Set**: one particular group of swims. Like 10x100m is a set of 1000 metres

Sometimes though *Set* may be used by people to describe the whole day’s training

**RI** : Rest Interval

**Neg. split** : Do the 2nd half of a set faster than the first half

**Br** : Stop and Breathe for a specific period ( e.g 200 f/c br 5 every 50 means swim 200 /fc stopping every 50 metres to breathe for 5 seconds).

**EZ** : Swim easy

**WU /  WD / SD** : Warm Up


**Bi-lat** : Bi-lateral breathing (breathe to both sides)

**4l/4r** : Breathe every 4 (or whatever number the set specifies) to the left or the right.

**Desc.** : Descending. Reduce the interval between sets

**MI**; reverse I.M. sequence

**IMO or IM Order**: One repeat of each stroke (4x100 IMO =100 fly, 100 fr) 

**IMO by round**: 4x(3x100) IMO by round = 3x100 fly, 3x100 free

There are some other things like l/s

**Examples**

Something like; 

- f/s 40×100 @ 1:40

Means: “Do front crawl, starting each time after 1 minute and 40 seconds (for a total of 4,000 metres).” 

(This is a popular set with distance swimmers

In this case the rest is determined by how much under 1:40 you finish. If it’s 1:20 you have 20 seconds rest

Another example:

- FR 12 x ( 4 x 25 on :25) @ 2:00

This is more complicated &amp; means: ” Do front crawl, 12 times. Giving a total of 48 lengths, 1200 metres.

Sometimes the time is not specified

* BK 15x50m 5 RI

means backstroke, with a 5 second rest. 

(BTW

*All of the above means that you can put a lot of information into a small amount of space like a pool whiteboard or onto a laminate.*",self,t5_2r0po,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/elk0n/swimming_notation_understanding_a_swim_training/

I had no idea what to expect- I still remember swimming (by myself, at a local YMCA) 5x25's on 1 minute. I hovered around 30 seconds. I then joined a club team, as any 13 year old would be about the coming practices. Wow. The initial experience of swimming was brutal for me. I went from going 5x25's on 1 minutes to 15x100's on 1:45. 13 year old me, felt like quitting. Somehow (I still don't even know why) I decided to stick with the sport. Around 4-5 weeks ago I decided to possibly pursue swimming as a career and or lifestyle. In a matter of 4-5 weeks, but through perseverance I hope to be. Good luck

Boland and Ehrman basically held serve from prelims, while Bundas lost a bit of the time Whitener had turned in on the fly leg in prelims. Whitener, however, blitzed the anchor leg with a stellar freestyle split en route to the record.

I have plenty I can talk about but I'll welcome suggestions/questions for subjects.

Anyway

For Open Water you need some things you will not have for the pool;

* Silicon swim hat (better than latex). I recommend ALWAYS wearing a hat

* Good goggles. Bigger goggles with rubber gaskets are preferable for open water. Swedish googles aren't really suitable. Googles should be able to stay sealed in choppy water and be comfortable for long durations. Aquasphere or Blue Seventy make great Open Water goggles. I use Aquasphere [Kaimans](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_sc_2_18?url=search-alias%3Dsporting&amp;field-keywords=aqua+sphere+kaiman&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=aqua+sphere+kaiman) exclusively. I have worn them without discomfort for almost 20 hours. Generally you need to be able to adjust the goggles while wearing them.

* You need TWO pairs of goggles

* Anti-chaffing lubricant. Salt from sea-water acculatates on skin contact surfaces and can lead to severe chaffing
  
  * Petroleum jelly. (Vaseline). Easy to apply in any weather. Lasts comfortably up to 2 or 3 hours. Messy. Don't get it on your goggles. Higher cost.

  * Body Glide (or similar)

  * Aluminium-based deodorant. Stick form

  * Lanolin. Pure grease which results from washing sheep wool for dying. Cheap. Most long-lasting. Difficult to apply when cold. Turns white on contact with water or sweat. Will ruin goggles if it gets on them.

  * Channel Grease, however... it's easy to make your own. 50% petroleum jelly/50% lanolin. Easier to apply than pure lanolin, lasts as long. Just as messy. Also changes colour on contact with moisture. Keep away from goggles also.

  * Duck/goose fat/butter/olive oil etc. Go ahead. Tasty. NONE of these will keep you warm.
 
* Ear-plugs. Reduce possible ear infections from Open Water and the possibility of Exotasis

* Sandals. Cold numbs feet. Numb feet can get lacerated very badly.

* Post swim clothes. 

  * Carry a old t-shirt for first layer as you will not get all the grease off until you have a shower.

  * Multiple lighter layers are the best way to rewarm. Hat &amp; gloves.

* Wet wipes or a damp cloth to wipe off grease. dishwashing liquid works best.

* Suntan lotion. Open water swimmer's tans tend to be deep and, even on dull days). (This is optional in Ireland!)

* Drink/food. Dehydration is more likely in OW where you can't drink regularly. Rewarming after cold water consumes far more calories than the pool. Be prepared.

~~* Optional: Vinegar. For jellyfish stings.~~ Vinegar (or urine) do not work for almost all jellyfish stings.

* Optional: Piece of carpet or rubber mat to change on.

* A swim box or leakproof bag to carry all this stuff in and to keep your clothes dry while swimming.

* Optional: Wetsuit. Some OW swimmers frown on them

Edit: * A watch. (Thanks broken_hand). While for a few this is optional

[This](http://ruthkazez.com/swimming/ZeroTo1mile.html) program is linked over in the FAQ so I thought I'd give my thoughts on how it worked for me.


some background:

In September I joined a gym


By the end of November I had worked up to swimming 200 yards but was still struggling with breathing even though my stroke was  coming together nicely(practicing 5-6 times per week).



I started the [ZeroTo1Mile](http://ruthkazez.com/swimming/ZeroTo1mile.html) program on November 27th; a little apprehensive but hopeful that my breathing would right itself as the laps increased.  I did the program lessons on Mon-Wed-Fri while continuing to work on TI drills on Tues-Thur-Sat.

Looking back

I'm an 18 year old boy
I swam competitively between the ages of 7 and 15, moved to water polo. I've always been relatively big, when I was 15, I weighed between 93-97kgs. Since then, I've obviously grown a bit, and unfortunately put on a lot of weight. I'm unhappy with the way I look (I know this isn't /r/weightloss or anything) so I'm motivated to come back into the sport. When I swam, I did 200 butterfly and 400IM as my main events. When I was 14, and my parents doubt that I could ever do a time like that again. To try and prove them wrong
I started the 63 days of training today

Warm Up:  
400 (50free/50back)  
2 x 100IM's on 1.45  
Main sets:  
4x50 fly (on 1.15
4x200 free (on 3m
Warm down:  
200 (25free/25back).  

I could continue doing this and building up until I am able to do 200 fly again

I am planning to do the swimming leg of a spring triathlon relay on June 23...so

I am not an ultra-beginner swimmer. I haven't swam competitively since high school (I am in my second year of graduate school now)

I've never done open-water swimming before

I am feeling really overwhelmed with all the information/training plans out there

I'm planning to attend a couple of open water swim clinics, and another on June 15, which involves a 300 meter loop. (These aren't in the lake where the triathlon will take place, but they were the best I could do.)

I also have the option of joining a Masters swim team (where I hope to get most of my instruction on technique), to be precise).

What advice do you all have in planning my 11 weeks of training? (Especially the next month or so when I don't have access to an organized swim program.) How can I get the most out of these 11 weeks in terms of my performance on race day?

I came here in fits of frustration after each go at it, not feeling like kicking was taking me anywhere, grandpa's lapping me (I actually got on here JUST to post this once and then found the exact post on that same day).  I didn't understand how I was so freaking bad.

I just kept at it though, was just getting comfortable being the water.  My second big step was to finally stop TRYING to go forward so much and just relaxing and keeping a steady pace.  Then as I began to break it down I got a rhythm to my breathing, then my kicking, then my strokes, and then it all just started falling together.  Now I'm at the point where I can keep doing all of it without really thinking, and then singling out something to work on.   I finally got all the way through the week 1 exercises with some gas to spare, and I'm ecstatic to continue.  Umm.. I guess it's time for a TL;DR

The class was registered as full, but it seems to be just me and two older ladies, one who is extremely afraid of water. 

Previously, and the last time I tried to learn, the instructor tried to teach me to scull (that was a no go) then jumped right into trying to get me to learn a freestyle. When I had issues breathing, the only advice he had was to get a pair of nose clips. Yesterday, we learned some breath control and floating front/back (thankfully, floating is something that I've been able to do), so this slower pace is making me feel a bit more confident about what I'm learning before trying to tack on one more thing to think about and coordinate my body to do.

The most important thing is: It's different for everyone.

Remember the marathon swimming motto: **Practice everything**.

But there are some guidelines.

* First

You can generally assume that that you have enough glycogen in your body to last from two to three hours. (Contingent on not having depleted it in training or recent exercise).

So for a swim or race under two hours

Swims where feeding is necessary dictate practice and experience. 

FINA marathoners will probably feed small amount every 10 minutes. This technique was pioneered by Peggy Dean and the US team in the 80s. The rest of us tend to feed from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. (I feed at thirty minutes). This MUST be tested

* Second - what do you feed on?

For most swimmers, scientifically shown to be more effective but has proven to be a problem for many swimmers (e.g. me) in distance sea swimming for a few reasons: (salt intake, prone position, soya protein metabolization).

Again

* How do you feed?

This again is to the swimmer's preference. Feed (dolly) poles which hand a cup or bottle to the swimmer. Or a bottle dropped on a rope. The commonality is feeding is mostly liquid. If using a pole the swimmer must not touch the  pole itself. I've also seen fishing poles used. 

* Anything else?

Containers: Experienced swimmers will often only use a container or bottle with particular features. This is not minor as using a wrong bottle type for a swimmer can lead to salt water or air ingestion

Will you need/use electrolytes? If so how will you schedule them into the feed plan? Do you have a feed plan so anyone on the crew can take it over at any point? Do you want to schedule any other *treats* ? Duration: Do you have enough if you swim runs over? Do not assume that knowledge of feeding in other endurance events will transfer to sea-swimming

Hey!

I learned to swim a couple of years ago in my thirties, the only other options for classes for adults are:
1. join a masters swim team where the requirements for entry are the ability to swim some large amount of m without stopping
2. join a class for triathletes who hate swimming and just want to be really fast

I don't know how to flip turn, see what's wrong with my form, flip turns).  

At this point I feel like a fraudulent swimmer because I don't know any of this stuff!

I feel like I am in the adult swim ghetto--by myself I can't get up to the number of meters I need to be in a team situation (and I don't really WANT to be on a team anyway), why can't adults get three?

I've considered the TI weekends

First I want to start off by saying I’m still young, to my parents’ wishes.  I started with one of my friends, with other friends who had already swam some.  My friend quit quickly, within a single season, but I stuck it out.  Let me say, I was no good.  I quickly realized that I could not swim butterfly or breaststroke.   Also, I was nowhere close to being the skinniest kid on the swim team; I had yet to work off my baby fat, at silver state (that’s what we call the meet right before state) I swam the exact state cut for 50 back.  I didn’t go to state for an individual, I wanted to quit.  But then I made the state cut in the long course 200 backstroke, and swam the 1000 as a bonus event.  That was when I discovered my calling as a distance swimmer.  I started swimming the 500

TL:DR: I used to be chubby and slow, and started working hard.  Now seeded third and fifth in the state for the 200 and 500 free respectively, along with two top 16 relays.

As you may know, we wish to see marathon swimming continue to be celebrated and encouraged, and confusion with other types of swimming reduced (which intends no disrespect to those swimmers and swims). This has been an increasing area of concern for marathons swimmers who operate under rules in place since 1875 and Captain Webb's first English Channel crossing.

As a step toward fostering and supporting marathon swimming

We had a “soft” launch last week with a small global invitation list in order to get some people involved before announcing the forum more widely and to test it and see if the idea was valid or potentially valuable

The CS&amp;PF Channel email group

Marathonswimmers.org is not intended to replace or compete with any of those, help and add to our global community.

It is intended to be open

There is no cost and no commercial element. It’s a free forum that we hope will become integral to the global marathon swimming community

We hope it will be useful for learning AND teaching, volunteering, making connections, encouragement, trackers, cheering, celebrations and congratulations

From beginner to the world’s most famous open water and marathon swimmers

We dearly hope if this is your area of interest you will drop by and make it yours.

I got some requests for a stretch-cord shoulder routine

**15 minute shoulder/rotator cuff strengthening set**

Materials: Two stretch cords

*Stretches: 1 minute per stretch

* Pinky-lead. Standing, or straight out like Jesus) raise your arms with the pinky side of your hand leading. If you're overextending your arm at the elbow you can keep a slight bend in the elbow, just make sure whatever bend you have remains constant throughout the movement. Raise arms until they're point up over your head. Lower slowly. At the bottom of the exercise don't let any slack come in to the cord, keep tension on the entire time. That goes for the whole set.

*Stretch: Arm across the front

* Palm-lead. Standing

*Stretch: Arm behind the head

* Super-mans. Standing, but this time lead with the backs of your hands and raise them straight out in front of you, until they're above your head and you look like superman. These are slightly more difficult than the previous two and if you have to you can cheat by bending backwards a little when raising and lowering. Don't turn it into a military press by bending your elbows, that defeats the point.

*Stretch: front of shoulder pull

* Pulses #1. Standing, 60 reps. For the next to exercises you'll want a short, heavy cord. I generally take the purple cord and wrap it around my fist a couple times to shorten it. You're standing on the middle of the cord, and bent as close to 90 with as close to a flat back as you can manage. Your arms should be straight and your hands should be next to your legs, about even with your knees. Backs of the hands point behind you. Keeping your arms straight and the backs of your hands pointing behind you/up at the sky raise your arms directly behind you, they should come up to almost even with your spine. These are pulses so keep them quick, full range of movement should only take about 1 second. When you get to 60 your arms should be burning a little.

*Stretch: low grip

* Pulses #2. Standing, 60 reps. Almost identical to Pulses #1, but this time instead of going back your arms are going out to your sides. You probably shouldn't be reaching parallel to the ground on this exercise, it has a slightly smaller range of movement than the last one. It's also less tricep focused and more shoulders only. Backs of the hands lead, straight arms, usual drill. One second pulses with as great a range of movement as you can maintain. On both this one and the last one you can do a 5-10 second hold in the extended position once you reach 60 if you're feeling competitive. 

*Stretch: high grip, don't push to hard because it's easy to pull the front of your shoulder in this position*

* Outward rotator cuff #1.  Standing, listen carefully to this part; take your heavy cord, and bring it behind you, the middle of the cord should be right at the base of your coccyx, now bring the ends in front of you and wrap the cord all the way around your hips, now the cord should cross itself right at the front of your hips, grip the part of the cord that is just past where they cross, right side with you right hand, [reference pic for the resting position of the exercise](http://i.imgur.com/kLM4c.jpg). Note that in the second picture the cord is under tension; like the rest of the set there is no resting position where you're not holding tension in the cord. Now for the exercise. This time you can actually bend (extend) your elbows, you should rotate the hands out while keeping them raised as long as possible

*No stretch

* Inward rotator cuff+Pulses #3. Standing, and for my cord length/hip width I can now grab the cord right behind the handle. Wherever you grab, make sure when your elbows are against your hips there is tension on the cord. The first and last 6 reps are inward rotator cuff, you should keep your upper arms basically stationary and your elbows fixed, while your lower arms go from parallel to the ground and pointing straight in front of you to crossed against your belly, alternate which arm is on top when crossed. This is a strong movement and shouldn't tire you out. While the pulses should be hard to do right. After the first 6 rotators you should keep your grip on the cord where it is and hold your arms out to your sides [like this](http://i.imgur.com/1k2Sw.jpg). Keep your arms straight (no elbow bend) and the 8 pulses should be straight out to the side. Then 8 more pulses straight out to the front, this time you have to bend your elbows, keep your hands at roughly hip height. Then back to 6 more rotations just like the first 6.

*No stretch

* Outward rotator cuff #2. Standing, ""out (same as #1), up (from the fully extended position bend your elbows and raise your hands up to hip height, wherever they are is fine as long as they're at hip height and still as far out as you can go), and in (release back to the ""rest"" position same as in #1)"". Count on about one second for each one of ""out"", ""up"", ""in"". 12 cycles of that. After the last to exercises this should be hard

*No stretch

* Last exercise, 12 reps. Form is (even more) important in this exercise. You start and finish in a ""he-man"" pose. Standing on the middle of your light cord your upper arms are parallel to the ground and straight out from your torso. Your lower arms and pointing straight up with your wrists above your elbows.

Your wrists move in an arc from directly above your elbows to directly in front of you elbows. It helps to do this one in front of a mirror or dark window so you can watch your upper arms and try to make sure they don't move (and also check out your guns). Slow lower, slow raise. 12 reps.

I have to love a question more interesting than ""how do you deal with boredom and cold?"".

I wrote a quick list of the things I could think of straight away. I'm sure there are more I'll think of later.

Camaraderie
--------------
First and foremost, sharing tea or hot chocolate, cakes and biscuits in all weather, at all times of day and year, talking shite, but mostly talking about weather, swimming and the sea. Barbeques in Sandycove at midnight after a swim. Getting a cup of tea and a biscuit when you've forgotten to bring any. Loaning someone grease

Sense of well-being &amp; exhilaration
-----------------------------------------
What brings an 85 year old man to the sea every day? A sense of well being from that 20 metre dip. Meeting the people he has been frinds and swimming with for 60 years. Regardless of scientific eveidence of the tangible and measureable beneficial health effects of cold water swimming

Challenge
-----------

Open water, you should always know, that you are not the boss in there. It's said that sometimes the greatest freedom comes from letting go. Open water challenges you to accept that you will never be greater than nature, regardless of how experienced you are. And it and you challenge youself when you enter the natural environment. You challenge yourself to become one with it, not to be an outsider there, but to become part of something larger, something greater. I  have to mention here that I am an atheist. But being an atheist doesn't preclude a sense of wonder. In fact being an atheist has always fuelled for me that sense of wonder in the world around me, rather than accept without questioning. And it is rarely greater than when around or in the sea.

Competition
-------------

And there's competition, or ability. Open water caters for all classes and ages in a spectacularly fun way. Beginner and intermediate races are often easy to get into. And if you have a reputation or record, you find yourself getting invited to other events.

Constant Change
-------------------

The repetition of the pool is a problem from many open water swimmers. That sense of adventure is one side of our experience of constant change in open water

Similar to the aspect of challenge is the fact that no two days are the same in open water. There is a non-linear aspect to open water, every time you are in the sea, some aspect of that day that was unique. And that will last all your life. You will remember swims from years ago, for no particular reason than maybe a  cormorant came down to check on you while you were swimming past Seal Rock. Maybe the currents have moved again. The light hit you in a different place or there was a sudden surge of cold or warm water where there's never been one before. The sea has almost reached out to you and if you allow yourself, you can take each and every one of these moments as as a gift.

Ego
----

The seas cares nothing for your ego. But sure you have an ego. We all do afterall, within most of us is something that we define as us, to ourselves, that is our ego. The sea will take all egos and only damage who fail to recognise that their eog is not greater than the sea.

Natural world
---------------

At a very simple level, rules and the people who love enforcing rules through power games.
No-one owns the sea. When you step into it, then you dissociate from it, and it's easier to feel that you have no direct relationship wih it, and more importantly it's easier to stop caring about it and to feel that your own personal actions have no effect on it. Every swim in the sea is adventure. What will the currents, winds and tides be doing? Will I see wildlife today? What direction will I swim? Every single time around Sandycove Island or out to the Metalman or down Clonea is different. Recently I swam through the largest bloom of jellyfish I've ever seen and that's saying something. It was truely astonishing. I had to stop and just float because of how extraordinary it was. No-one else ever in the world will swim through that bloom, see that sight. And I climed onto the rock, the first time I've done so. Was I the first person to ever swim out there and then climb onto it? The rock on the seaward side is completely covered in layers of tiny petrified winkle shells and is extremely difficult to walk on. There was partial sunshine and the water on the far side was very cold. Another little adventure. Tomorrow will be a different one. You can make your own adventures.

Flying
------

Leonardo Da Vinci said that swimming was the closest a person could ever come to flying. Despite all the technological advancements, you feel weightless and three hundred and sixty degress of freedom. I don't just swim out to sea, I am also flying out there, seeing the land from my own altitude, but with a similar sense of being apart, alone and in my element.

Extension of swimming ""life""
--------------------------------

So many kids swim in pool clubs. Then come 16 or 17 and it's over for them. Or maybe they go to colloege and squeeze another few years out of it. I've seen how the competitive pool world works. Too many people trying to dominate kids and parents

Feeling alive
--------------

A bad day in is the sea is better than a good day in the pool. There is always an element of risk in the sea, by understanding as much as I can, but I also admit to occasionally needing to do something that is deeply scary and therefore stupid. Last week I swam diagonally out of the bay to sea, kilometres away from land. It was scary. I felt alive. Maybe swiming in neck deep water is all you require for this. Or worrying about cold, or jellyfish, or fish or rocks. Anything. Everything. They all make you feel alive out there. Never in the sea will you be in that dozy state possible so many other places.

Fear
-----

So, had a bunch of crap happen in my life so I didn't do any exercise and the quadriceps basically disappeared - and I hurt the knee again. For the past few months I've been going to the gym, trying to get the quadriceps back (it's getting there, slowly) and I decided to start swimming (because riding a stationary bike sucks). Since I didn't really know how to swim I started with an instructor (group of usually five - eight people, three times a week, for an hour in the pool).

So I am doing well, I am avoiding it. And honestly I don't care for it much.

Last time the instructor kept convincing me that the breast stroke is really not hard on the knees and I should just do it, and blah blah blah. So I got tired of standing still in the pool like an idiot, arguing with him, and I tried it for a length (twenty five meters). My technique is nonexistent, and I felt my knee hurting a bit. Afterwards he said: 'it hurts because you're kicking too hard, if you do it properly it won't hurt.'. Well duh, but I don't know how to do it right

Tools currently at my disposal:

* Garmin 910XT
* Polar heart rate monitor (used only for swimming)

* Finis Freestyler hand paddles

* Flippers (Zoomers I think?)

* 25 yd pool

So, and doing it at about 1:50/100yd, which is just slower than my previous Ironman pace.

Hopefully this gives an idea of where I'm at right now.

Bi-lateral breathing:
----------------------

An important skill for open water is the ability to control your breathing. More so than pool where bi-lateral is nice

 * Firstly bi-lateral breathing is more important for safety. The swimmer can obviously see more, rope, boats. 
 * It's a great aid in bad weather. For example, well, welcome to throwing up due to swallowed water, or abandoning to due to swallowed or aspirated water.
 * Apart from the navigation aspects consonant with being able to see more, are rarely aware of swimmer's requirements, (regardless of briefings), sometimes go on the swimmer's blind side. It's easier to not have a blind side. 
 * Breathing to one side causes blind spots in races. For example I like to swap to a swimmer's weaker side on a turn or approaching a finish. Lead them to believe you have dropped behind and then come around them. And there are other ways to take advantage of someone with limited breathing options ...

Other breathing skills;
------------------------
 * In rough water
 * Another problem if you are considering longer distances in the sea

Improving sighting:
----------------------

 * Sighting is a *vital* skill. 
 * Try to sight from the crest of waves
 * Separate breathing from sighting. 
 * Keep sighting as brief as possible.
 * Start with sighting every 6 or 8 strokes. As your skill and confidence grows you will be able to reduce the required amount. Sighting is hugely dependent on conditions. Flat water requires less
 * Try looking forward from as close to the surface as possible. EDIT: [see this pic of Olympic Medallist Keri-Ann Payne for a good example](http://www.imgur.com/5DppN).  Lifting your head to get a good look will drop your legs, I favour my right side. BUT, just after beathing on my left side, I find I have greater control on looking forward from a very low postion, with my eyes about 1 cm above the water, than if I try to do the same thing when moving my head from the right. So you will need to find you own optimum position. This can be practised in the pool. ",,self,,

So why do waves present such difficulty? It's simply because water is dense, divert or stop.

Everyone has probably stood on a beach in waist high waves and felt how easily the waves can push one around.  

Children learn to jump as the waves approaches to go over the top

The video below perfectly illustrates the problems faced by swimmers unfamiliar with waves.

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWH1agpu4M]

I hope you noticed the guy on the left at the start, he went under the waves.

Power within a wave is concentrated when it is breaking in the crashing top of the wave. Waves breaking into shallow water

The water in front of a wave is sucked up into the wave face

Remember that water being dumped on beaches by waves needs to escape back outward

The trough in front of a wave is lower than the average height, but if you come up just behind the lip of a crashing wave, you have to be careful not to get dragged back over the edge, ""going over the falls"", though is generally not a problem unless you are very close.


In [this image of a local shingle beach](http://imgur.com/hHScv), some is banked. The areas between the banks are more likely to be deeper, and more likely to be channels as this trough extends outward. The difference will usually look somewhat subtle, but is pretty consistent. If you notice in the image, where the arrow starts, the sand extends further into the shingle as this is a lower trough and this recurs along the beach, so there is actually more than one channel, the effect will dissipate.


* Don't panic. There is no situation made better by panic and most will be made worse

* Don't try to get away from waves. You won't win. Face them and work with what they are doing.

* Look for channels, don't try to swim back into land against it.

* In water where you can walk, moving out in the intervals between the wave fronts.

* Once you reach chest deep water, so get swimming.

* The best approach when going out from a beach is to dive under the oncoming waves.

* Don't take a huge breath of air

* Don't try the same thing with waves breaking over rocks. Because idiocy.

* Swimming against a rip current is a poor decision. Change your angle by 45 to 90° and you will quickly move out of it.

* As you progress out pass the breaking waves, one of front of the other, a house and tree or similar, and you will be able to tell your position along a beach. Otherwise you can be 100 metres to either side and it will still look like the same place.

Waves interfere with swimmers by stopping them getting out deeper, by pulling their legs from beneath them and by breaking over them. All these problems can be reduced or eliminated with experience and practice.

I am a 18 year old senior in High School (America so units will be yards) and I cant stay motivated to swim any more. I have swam since I was a wee little lad and my coaches have always been impressed by my ability to perform at all ages regardless of how hard I work. Literally everyone tells me I have natural talent in the sport

I quit swimming for a year (age 13-14) and came back to a new coach at my local swim program. He was the best damn coach I have ever seen. He brought me from a 5:55 in my 500yard freestyle to the 4:48 I currently sit at. He brought me from a first time miler 18:42 to a 16:32 in a year. At my swim program there were 4 people in my age group

So I am gridlocked and cant find any motivation to even touch water. I have potential to swim at least swim in Division II NCAA but still

So I ask you swimmit,False,self,t5_2r0po,False,,,t3_nzc5q

",1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/nxxcv/tonight_is_the_hardest_workout_of_the_entire_year/,"Since Region is right around the corner, my coach makes the hardest workout of the year on New Year's Eve. Since I'm only a Freshman, this will be my first year going to it. People who have been swimming all four years say that it so hard

For those who are concerned
111 75's on the 1:15.
(Swimming 75 yards in one minute and fifteen seconds continually until you've done it 111 times)
But it changes every year. This is just an example of how extreme the workout is going to be.

So

TL;DR: My coach plans to torture us with an extreme workout tonight from 5-7 that most people don't make it the whole way through. How do I survive it?



UPDATE: It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. You guys really helped! As I said, my coach told me to start making them under the 1:30 and that's exactly what I did. He walked up and down the lanes (I was in lane 1) with me telling me to keep my elbows up, make my entry deeper, my turnover faster, etc. Even though I knew I could have pushed myself faster, I still feel a sense of pride that I did every single one with time to spare. 

My twin sister who also swims stopped atleast 6 times and turned to me and said

TL;DR: The workout ended up being 60 100's on the 1:52 with every fifth one being swam last length butterfly. I finished everyone ahead of my group with time to spare.

1325165426.0,nuw2b,Questions about breathing.,tenekejimmy,15,2,15,"Now that I can do 6x25 yards without drowning or drinking half of the pool (it's down to only 1/4 now. :) ) and out of survival mode

I try to have one google underwater and rotate my head with the body. I can't always do it though

To prevent this I seem to do the last stroke with extra power... it pulls me out of the water slightly and gives me a second more to breathe. But I worry that this is something that could cause shoulder problems later.

Also, in what angle? I'm guessing I should always keep the same angle between my arm and my body, pulling and pushing the water towards my hips no matter where my body is facing, right?

1324301755.0,nigt3,Open Water Wednesday: Planning a Christmas or New Year cold open water swim? Some advice.,TheGreatCthulhu,17,3,5,"This is just a rehash of [last year's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/eop7t/advice_extensive_for_anyone_considering_a/) for those who remember.

It has plenty of detail but **the most important items are IN BOLD**.


With Christmas coming

A Christmas or New Year's Day swim is absolutely worth doing for the sense of well being afterwards. You do not have to come over to the Dark Side of swimming.



Cold is a skill


**PLAN:**

* **Make sure you have**: **a swim cap** (silicone or neoprene preferably)

* If you only have latex cap

* Bring sandals or deck shoes.

* **Bring something to stand on while changing**. A spare towel

* Put your swimsuit on before you leave home. You will spend less time getting cold before you swim. Don't forget your underwear! :-)

**OBSERVE:**

* If it's an irregular visit

* Watch the water before you get it. Regardless of the amount of people in it, rocks or a ladder, the exit will be difficult, dangerous or impossible.

* If you have been drinking alcohol the night before

* Forget grease. It does nothing for cold protection and you won't in long enough to worry about chafing. If you are swimming that long

* Neoprene (wetsuit) gloves and booties will significantly reduce the discomfort if you are not used to it. There are no Channel rules in operation for Christmas Day swims.

**BEFORE THE SWIM:**

* Take the clothes on your lower body off first. Keep your torso &amp; body warm for longer.

* Change as close to the water as you safely can. You want to reduce the time exposed before and after swimming.

* Wear the sandals as close to the edge as you can. The ground will be colder than the sea. Cold = numb = lacerations = blood.

* **DO NOT STAND AROUND TALKING** once you are changed

* IT'S NORMAL TO BE NERVOUS because your body is adapted to avoid cold. Just be positive. Accept the increased heart rate. Tell yourself you are a swimming god.

* It's not a competition. Depending on your location there may be lots of people who don't know what they are doing in the water that day. 

* Stay clear and watch everything. Move carefully.

* **SPLASH WATER on your face before immersion**. This indicates to your body extreme cold is coming (by which I include temperatures of up to 14C/58F for those of you not used to it). It will allow your heart rate to settle quicker and make breathing easier.

* Just as you get in..tell yourself it's warm. Cold is partly about attitude. Tell yourself it's actually better than you thought. *Hell

* **DO NOT DIVE IN**. Just don't do it. I don't care how tough you think you are. Unless you are a very experienced cold water swimmer this is a dumb thing to do. It causes heart attacks and rock impacts. But don't stand there trying to get in either. Walk in to your waist. 

* Splash the water. Then off you go. No more than 1 minute getting immersed.

**DURING THE SWIM:**

* Without experience it is difficult to get your face into cold water. This is normal. Cold stimulates the gasp reflex through increased heart rate. It makes breathing difficult. This is also normal.

**STAY CALM.**

* Change your breathing pattern to head above water or breathing every stroke or 2nd stroke.

* Without experience expect your heart rate to take many minutes to settle.

* **DO NOT STOP IN THE WATER**

* **HAVE A GREAT TIME**. Feel like a hero. Do 10 metres. Or 20 or 50 or 500 metres. It probably won't kill you. Probably.

**EXIT:**

* Watch your exit. Be careful. It is at this point most lacerations occur on the feet

* Get your sandals/slippers on and get to your clothes.

* The temperature WILL be below 10C

** AFTER THE SWIM:**

* **AFTER-DROP** is dangerous**. You have only about 8 minutes before its onset. After-drop is the body temperature dropping after you exit the water. It's not a problem if you are only in a couple of minutes though

* **DO NOT VIGOROUSLY TOWEL YOURSELF.** It will accelerate afterdrop.

* Dry the torso first. Dress the torso.

* Then put on a hat.

* Then the lower body.

* Then have your chat

Go home and stuff yourself.
