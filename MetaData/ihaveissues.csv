It seems like a ton of mental and verbal abuse from H. You deserve better than that! Listen to your friends. This guy sounds like he sucks.

He is a manipulator. Your family and friends love you. Your husband is controlling you. People who control you DO NOT love you.

1364085007.0,1avzpb,I'm a 17 year-old female and I am hearing and seeing things that other people do not see. Is it just my imagination or is this an early sign of a more serious disorder?,anakedape,36,6,37,"I have several issues already

1. I was in a bathroom stall changing out of my workout clothing when I dropped a ring on the floor. On contact with the tile

2. I was walking home from school with a friend when the sidewalk began to stretch width-wise, and as with the ring example above, it immediately halted upon direct observation.

3. I was walking in a national park late at night with another friend. We were up to some trouble so I was nervous, wide, dark portion was moved sideways and was snapped back to its original location. I jumped at this time and attempted to explain my actions to my friend, who had not seen the strange shift.

4. A few nights ago I was lying awake in my bed staring at the objects around my room, and upon returning my gaze they had shrunken, but this was not the case as I was observing them steadily the entire time. It is hard to explain. 


My examples may seem to present the case as cut-and-dry, such as marching soldiers of which I could hear, internally, the rhythmic beating of their drums and marching, coming towards my bedroom. They were often heard mumbling and chanting incoherent things to me. I introduced above the experience of viewing the objects in my room as animals. I am taken to understand this is a common occurrence for children, and indeed it happened every night as a girl. However I still experience this phenomenon, and occasionally the objects in my room will move towards me or even out of my line of vision. This also happens with shadows or other wispy figures quite often, under the couches

I have also been hearing, and it varies from a slow, drawn-out call to a very quick muttering. It is usually quiet, as if us two were in a large room and were speaking at a low volume in an intimate way. It is not at all malicious and I am not frightened when this happens, but it is nonetheless troubling. Occasionally I will hear another person's name being called, next to my ear, just over my right shoulder.

I'm tired of hurting her.. I see how tired and worn down she looks after having to deal with my episodes. I hate myself because of it

I'm incredibly paranoid and jealous.
I force her to push friends and family away.

I log on to her facebook with out her permission.
I go through her texts..

And when my fucking mood swing is over.. i look at her

I wake up and see that she's not the same bubbly, i first fell in love with.. but someone who lives in fear and constantly looks more and more burnt out.

Ive taken up drinking quite a bit.. i find that it mellows me out and i become a much nicer person. I let my feelings out and i tell her i love her. But when im not drinking, and suicidal.

the thing that ways on my conscious the most:
 Is that I took her virginity. I took her first kiss. I was her first everything.

And i manipulated and persuaded her into letting me do so..
 So her innocent and naive heart doesnt want to leave me because in her mind: Im the one. She was saving all of those things for the man she married

I love her so much.. and i want to marry her.. and i want to spend my life with her.. but im just so scared im going to push her and everyone else forever away.

 We've been together two years now and we live together. I love her more than anything else in the world but she has issues. Her dad committed suicide when she was a kid. She has severe anxiety along with abandonment issues. She also has some pretty deep self esteem and body image issues. I try everyday to help and I am extremely extremely patient but she always seems to make her issues the forefront of everything excusing whatever she does with them and I deal with it and deal with it but I can never be angry or she insists that I hate and am going to leave her despite never ever once even implying I would ever leave. And it gets so I start resenting that and then we have a big crying spectacle that takes two hours for me to try to tell her how I feel before she goes right back to acting how she always does. And I know she loves m and that this is just as hard for her as it is for me to deal with but it sucks that I can never be mad at her and can never criticize her without it being a huge deal.

 As for the college thing I was an idiot and fucked around in high school because I was just a dumb kid and now despite having scored a 2280 out of 2400 on the SAT I can't get into college because I can't get scholarships or loans because my dad hasn't paid his taxes in years and nowhere is going to offer me a full ride with the 2.0 GPA I graduated with. I'm not that same dumb kid and I wish I wasn't judged now for shit I did as a fucking highschooler.

 I had a job I hated to my very core and was recently fired from for having a poor internet connection (I worked from home.) And now I can't find another job because I am not experienced enough. and jesus I just want some advice or someone to talk to. I think this anonymity works for me because I hate asking for help but I just feel lost and desperate and I don't know about anything anymore because I always thought I would always have my relationship but it's struggling and I just don't know anymore.

1356002472.0,155val,"(33/F) Massive weight loss, virgin, socially awkward.",ballofanxiety,19,20, I gained about 70 lbs, and I grew a full beard as a result. I'd pluck and shave for about 2 hours every day

I also had destructive and abusive ""friends"" during this time in my life because I was desperate for socialization and I took what I could get. I convinced myself that I was somehow privileged to be their friend. In reality

In a last ditch effort, but I'm at a very ""normal"" size. I'm comfortable, but I want to lose another 30 lbs ideally and it *will* happen, though all of my comorbidities are already gone, and I feel so much better now. I even had laser hair removal and got rid of all of my facial hair. The difference was staggering.... mind numbing really. When I actually took the time to look at the reduced hair on my face, and my thinner face, I cried. I had forgotten what I looked like. I started taking better care of myself, though I only use light foundation. Still

People treat me like I'm *normal* too. I even look pretty good, but I don't lie about it and it doesn't come up much anyway. This is actually genetic in my family, my teachers used to think my mom was my older sister, even though she's 25 years older than me. 

I'm also doing much better now in terms of depression and anxiety, though sometimes I wonder if I should take something for my anxiety!

So here's the thing. While I was big, I've been asked out a couple times. I have politely declined because I did not like the guys who asked; we had nothing in common, and they were too young (18yo and 20yo) and not very serious, and I don't like their personalities very much, and they weren't interested in being friends first. I was super flattered though, and it gave me a confidence boost and alerted me to the fact that guys are looking at me now...

I just turned 33 last week, a virgin. The last boyfriend I had was when I was 16, and we didn't do anything more than a simple kiss. I didn't even masturbate til I was 27, and even then it was all external since I have a particularly resilient hymen (can't even use tampons) and, well, I didn't exactly want to force the issue and become totally disinterested. My hormonal issues already made me disinterested in sex, and I decided to try to masturbate at 27 just to see if it would help. It resolved my sleeping disorder, I wasn't in the mindset to just enjoy it. These days I do enjoy it more because I don't hate myself, and I've waited so long I have no idea what to do about it. Was thinking of getting my doctor to perforate the hymen so the idea of pain is out of the way.

It's also kind of hard to read people since I feel like I'm in a new society now. It's hard to explain, they smile at me, they look at me when they talk to me. When you're big, people can really be so cruel and they don't even realize it. They avoid you like fat is contagious and you're patient Zero.

Anyway, because they never think about me like that, so why get my hopes up? I've been living in the dark for so long that I forgot where the light switch was. So when he started to sort of try to get to know me, I was shocked.

This guy has gone out of his way to approach me, he sometimes sits next to me during meetings even when there are seats free everywhere, he sought me out at the company get-together even though I was sort of hiding. He asked one of my close coworkers at the get-together if I was old enough to go out for drinks sometimes. He smiles at me a lot. People smile at me often, but not really this consistently. He also brings me candy and stuff sometimes, which is kinda funny since I'm very strict about what I eat, but I always accept and eat a little, toss the rest without him seeing. Maybe I'm seeing too much into this and he's just a cool dude to everyone

I like him quite a bit too, I'll feel pretty foolish and I'm worried I'll go back into social hiding. It's like Groundhog Day and I'm worried that I'll see my shadow and run back to my den for months.

**tl;dr**: 

* I'm a virgin and I'm worried that will scare off guys because they will think I'll get super attached or something. Also the hymen thing. So embarrassing. I've only heard horror stories and I can't imagine it being fun for the guy either. No idea what to do.

* I lost a lot of weight and have excess skin. It's actually not too bad, but not until I'm done losing weight... probably in a year. Saving money already, and I have a surgeon ready to go, basically.

* I'm worried if the guy realizes my age, so he's 4-5 years younger than me. I don't want to hide my age, but I certainly don't want to bring it up in any way. 

* I'm still very socially awkward and quiet. The guy at work is kind of the opposite. He has a lot of friends

We got into a fight yesterday and when i said gnight i love you he didn't respond, i've noticed it, i'll admit it on here. I look deeply into almost everything that people say, whether it's meant to be deep or not. I've had to go on medication recently and i feel like i've nearly ruined our relationship because of my mood swings and fears that he's cheating on  me. 

Now this is a rational fear, it really is. I just want him to respond, because it's a terrible feeling to be left hanging when you say i love you.

I havent settled into college life the way i thought i would either so i feel as though i'm clinging to him and every person i left at home, i get very anxious, it's hard to tell from the outside but i'm always afraid i'm gonna say something that makes them think i'm fucked up and i sometimes worry tat theyre only friends with me out of pity and it's scary as shit to think about. It makes me want to hide in my room and talk to my best friend, who's in a different state, and my boyfriend. I just feel so different day by day that i don't know how to relate or get comfortable around new people. That's why i was hoping the meds would help and i would stop tearing myself apart every time he doesn't send an i love you text, or she doesn't ask me how my day was. I feel jealous of everyone that gets to be around people that they have known their whole lives because sometimes things just feel so unreal here and i keep getting so dumbfounded that i'm in college and have met so many new faces that it overwhelms me to the extreme. 

So i guess that this goes a little deeper than a text
TL:DR: bf usually sends gnight text, it ruins my life.

UPDATE: It turned out his phone was just broken, so i decided that in order to prove to myself that i wasn't needy i would go without texting him for a week. We were supposed to see eachother that weekend so i thought it wouldn't be so bad, but then he said he got sick and he couldn't go so the third day in i broke down to my friend and then i decided no, i wasn't going to quit i had to do it.

 It turned out to be one of the happiest, but i was so much more in the moment when i knew that i just didn't have the ability to text him. It was a week before valentines day too, so when we finally did see each other it was like a glorious reunion in a way. They do say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it's definitely true. You see how well you can do without the person but you also see how important they are to you and realize that you really want them to be a part of your life. I say want because need sounds scary, though sometimes i really feel like i do need him i am still trying not to feel that way.

 I haven't been as happy for the last week because of other family things going on and i've started taking a medication and mixed it with alcohol, thought that i loved, and i'm really sorry for that.

 I wish that i adjusted to college life a little better, even when i'm being horrible and bitchy and undeserving of their help. I have friends who i love and although sometimes i'm scared that they don't love me as much as i love them i'm still grateful that they let me hang out with them. I have pretty blue eyes. I have the ability to walk.

1366408807.0,1cpbk5,This is a description of a super toxic relationship pattern I've caused and seen others in. Sharing to help others identify if its their or their SO's pattern. Mod pre-approved.,nothingbutme1221,18,0,4,"I know the this isn't the usual format for a post to this sub. I got the post pre-approved by a moderator.

The following is relationship pattern I’ve been in and seen others in. Its super toxic for everyone involved. I feel awful thinking about it and just wanted to share my experience so that maybe someone else can identify what they’re doing/involved in.

I feel like I need to mention somewhat upfront for context is that a lot of my ex's had low self esteem and I can be very attentive and caring in the initial stages of a relationship. Also, I did care deeply about these girls. The previous three things are what I think enabled to the following pattern to occur.

Basically, just disengaged. When confronted I would insist that everything was fine and there was nothing wrong. They would try to pull closer to me to try and fix things, which was impossible because I refused to discuss what was wrong or bring myself to make demands on my SO.

This only made things worse because I tend to need a lot of personal space to recharge. Of course this is not something I mentioned to them. So I would become more detached

Enter fake or over dramatic crises. This too was in part my fault. I have some issues related to my conception of what being ""a man"" is. One of these is that it was my job to help and comfort a SO through rough times. So I would go all out on being there for them and emotionally present and connected. However after helping them through said crisis

After awhile of this, I wouldn't want to break up with them because it appeared to me (I was dumb and didn't see the situation for what it actually was) that they were going through all sorts of issues and needed me for support. Which, to a certain extent they did because the past 9-10 month of dealing with me drove them to a spectacularly bad place emotionally.

So now were dating

(Optional step) Cheating. Not on my part. However, they would either feel awful about themselves and what they were doing and confess or I would catch them. All the unsaid drama of the past 6 months explodes into a cataclysm of fighting and I break up with them. They want to get back together and act crazy about it.

If that step doesn't occur. Then Eventually I crumble under the stress of trying to ""help"" them and I break up with them. They want to get back together and act somewhat crazy about it.

This process played out three times in my life each time over a period of 12-16 months. The only thing I will say in my defense is that I had zero clue about how all of the interaction fit together and didn't see the patterns of my own actions.

Tl;dr Accidentally engaged in a pattern of behavior in relationships of mixed signals and poor communication combined whereby I slowly drove my partners off the deep end.

I knew him since I was 13 and he was 18. His mom is one of my mom's clients (she's a divorce lawyer) and we met in the waiting room of her office. We were together from the time I was 17 til I was 19, yet in an LDR so we technically were broken up yet neither of us dated anyone seriously. I'd visit him for 4 days every month while he was in California and I was home in Chicago. I moved out to be with him, but to also get away from home as I needed a change. 

It wasn't the best relationship, I am not my 13 year old self, and he is not his 18 year old self. I only wish it ended better.

I ended up moving back home after a year and a half. Los Angeles wasn't for me. I'd still visit monthly for those last 6 months. The last trip was a longer one, this one woman who saw him around before was there. They talked, flirted, and ended up having these long deep conversations at each event, leaving me alone to mingle. The day I left, he called me upon my landing at home to end it over the phone. He couldn't even do it in person. Shortly after this, they packed up and moved to Chicago. That hurt me a lot, as it was her home town. 

It's two and a half years later now. I have an awesome boyfriend who is everything my ex wasn't and beyond. It's not even a comparison. We are happy together. I didn't think I could love again

So why did I wake up sick to my stomach today? Why did I dream of them? My body physically hurts from it. I can't eat. I want them to be happy. All I could do last night was cry. It wasn't entirely about them, and as an outsider all I can see is what my mind chooses to see. We are Facebook friends, so of course all the posts about ""OMG CONGRATS, SO EXCITED 4 WEDDING 2NITE"" from our mutual friends turn up. Even if I were to block him, I'd still be reminded of him as our lives were so intertwined. SO while I'm here dealing with my dying mother and the potential loss of income, he's out getting married to the woman who was so much better than me that she was the straw that broke the camels back. 

All of our friends are in town. Some are calling me to hang out. It hurts to much to even see them. I know why they are in town and I can't get excited about it. 

I have to leave for work now. It's my day off, or whatever, I'd feel disgusted. Fuck.

For some reason I have my mind set that I would like to fall in love with someone, which is how 99% of relationships go these days it seems. Anyway, numerous times now I've met a girl who says she likes me lot and could see being in a relationship with me, only for her to go back to her ex after telling me how much she likes me non stop for a week(s). I'm usually very hopeful when I meet someone who I like (since I don't like everyone) and who likes me back, but it always seems to fall apart. 

Lately this has happened so many times that I'm starting to feel like all women are heartless liars and that I can't ever trust them again. I know this isn't true. Really I've been lucky that I haven't got into any long term relationships yet

I'm naturally an introvert, although that seems to have mostly cleared up lately.  I'm very intelligent and breeze through high level engineering courses.  I live in a beautiful city, in a huge apartment, and have tons of free time.  I’m in the most competitive engineering program at my school and will be graduating with no debt if I stick with school.  It should be paradise, but I just can’t seem to figure out how to get it to work.

I’d like to think I’m a person who acts instead of talks, and smile as much I can.  I try to dress alright, get frequent haircuts, and I’ve worked out for years and eat fairly healthy so I’m in decent shape.   I don’t think I’m a “nice” guy.  Those people seem to have the problems of making too many friends.  If anything I probably come across as a bit arrogant, but I really do my best to show interest in the few people I meet, and to try to find something in common.

I used to always think it would get better…especially if I could get to college; it sounded like it would be easy to make friends there.  I did my first two years in community college, and the story still hasn’t changed at all.  One of the unfortunate aspects of the major I chose is that I have every class with the same 50 or so kids in the same building every quarter.   These are engineering students who have mostly done their first two years together, and I have not had any luck getting to know any of them.  I’ve taken a couple general classes too though, when I could, and the story hasn’t been any different there.  Being a transfer student, I didn’t have priority on dorms, so I ended up getting an apartment by myself too.  

That old friend I lost in high school did get back in touch with me, which is of course followed by disappointment.  
The one thing that has helped over the year has been marijuana.  I have no desire to become a stoner, a good movie, some good weed and a refuge from my problems helps keep me sane.

I know people are going to tell me to join a club or something, instead I find that in every situation I inevitably become an outcast.  I know most people don’t give a shit about me, but it really feels like the entire world hates me.

It’s not a self-esteem problem either, but I certainly have no confidence in my social abilities.  I don’t think this is unreasonable though, I’ve only associated social situations with pain.  I think this would change quickly if I had any evidence I could rely on to oppose it.  I also completely break down if anything sexual is involved, but again, I’ve had no practice here…

I really don’t have any desire to live anymore.  I’m so tired of boredom and loneliness.  It’s not enough to just be alive.  I feel like it is me against the world

Some might point to depression or something similar, I don’t think I could ever really be happy if it my social life is in shambles like it is.  I don’t think I have any more serious disorder like autism either, although I’ve considered it before.  I actually think, outside my social problems, I’m fairly grounded.  I have a lot of aspirations actually.  I’d like to travel, to try new food, to see a concert, to play sports

I think I’ve pretty much come to the conclusion that I would rather not live any more years if they are going to be like the previous ones.  I’m not one to joke about things like this; I already have a plan in place.  It makes me feel better knowing that I could act on it at any time

It seems so simple to fix too.  My life would probably improve greatly if I had just one close friend.  I can’t even imagine how nice it would be to have a girlfriend.  Not that I expect some girl to suddenly complete me or something

I really struggle with talking to people and I feel as though I am constantly being judged when in a social situation, but I hate my smile.

I have one female friend who tells me i'm her best friend but I feel as though she is embarrassed of me and finds me boring. Whenever we meet up it's always just the two of us and a movie. We don't hug or anything because she knows I'll act awkward. She has a descent social life

I would love a relationship with someone who shares my interests and views, almost every night and quite often at college. He was very understanding of my awkwardness and became very comfortable around him. He didn't have a religion like me and we have very similar interests. Though I feel his main friends dislike me as they wont even look at me. He asked me out and I declined. I don't know why but I couldn't. I thought before that if I found someone so similar to me and I also found them attractive, then I would have no trouble starting a relationship with them but still I can’t.

I really want to be able to cuddle up and be close to someone but I can't imagine myself doing it. I am quite eager to lose my virginity too. But can't see it happening

He's stopped talking with me online now, and they meet up often. He invited her round his for a small party on a day me and her had planned to meet up and she asked me if I'd mind meeting up just the two of us another night and I said it was fine. She also said that I was also invited but at college he never told me anything though we were together most the day. (my best friend doesn't go to our college). I'm sure she asked him if I could go to and I know he'd rather I wasn't there as I guess it would be better just the two of them and his mates so I told my friend I couldn't go.

I know it sounds so selfish but part of me wishes I hadn't introduced them. It's really selfish I know

Then, I slept with well over a dozen guys - I lost count - some multiple times, some only once (and always protected!).

Well


It's hard for me to get into the details. I could probably write a novel about it. I was young, insecure, and desperate to feel loved. The usual. At first, he was perfect. Kind, considerate, loving. We talked all night and all day, and I felt loved, beautiful. I was a virgin and he said he would wait as long as it took. I wanted to wait until I was out of high school to have sex and he was okay with that.

But, wasn't willing to bend on that. And then that is when he became emotionally abusive and controlling.

*You're stupid. You're ugly. You're fat. No one wants you. You're worthless. You're pathetic. You have no good qualities, miserable bitch.*

I would cry. And then he would make me feel better.... kind of. 

*Looks don't matter. I don't care that you're not smart - you're still okay. You can lose weight. It doesn't matter what other people think of you

Basically

It got worse from there. Looking back

It got to the point where he started sleeping around. He told me that these women were just for sex, so stupid..

During the week

*See her body? That's why I want you to work out. Her figure is so much sexier than yours.
See her eyeliner? I want you to do your makeup like that. I prefer that.
See how she wears her hair? You need to start doing your hair that way.*

I think he was just actively trying to turn me into someone else. I don't know.

At one point, then emailed them to all of his buddies and showed me the emails where they were making fun of how weird/odd/ugly my breasts were. One picture even showed some stretch marks on my ribs, and they attacked that as well.

**This is the portion that may be a trigger** I had even confided in him that I had been molested when I was a child. I told him how terrible I still felt about it

He got really controlling around the time I got my first cell phone. He would call me at 3am and tell me he was killing myself

And I'm not even the one that ended it. I was up one night

This terrified him. My 6'5

Since I had turned 18

Now I live in the same town as him. I would be lying if I said that I wasn't shrouded in this stupid gut wrenching fear every time I leave the house

The relationship fucked me up a lot. Afterwards, I was mean to.

My husband changed that. Instantly loved him. Instantly felt safe. It was instantly like, and our children, is my religion. I love him deeply. So much. He truly did save me in so many ways. I lost my  virginity to my husband, he is the father of my children.

But the problem is that every time I look in the mirror I still see stupid. fat. ugly. worthless. disgusting. stupid, fat, fat, ugly, ugly, ugly. **worthless.**

And I don't know how to stop. And I know I take it out on my husband and it's not fair to him.

It's not fair to him

I feel like I'm married to him... but still controlled by my ex. The only other person I ever dated.

I never feel good enough. I never feel up to par. Every ounce of feeling I have towards myself is just complete hatred and I just don't know how to stop. I can't help but feel like the word ""beautiful"" or ""Sexy"" in reference to me is just a joke.

This guy fucked my head up so bad. I still feel stupid. I haven't even told my husband all of the details. I haven't told anyone all of the details. I don't know how to.


I don't know what I'm asking for. I'm just asking.

**Insights**

In summary, I am starting to accept my feelings and letting go of the strong image to be myself all the way, including love, happiness and trust, as well as doubts, weaknesses and mistakes.

Showing emotions has always been hard for me. This is rooted in parenting and how I was treated in grades 1-6 (age 7-13). Being strong and not showing emotions was my only way of avoiding negative reactions and gaining some desperately needed positive attention.

In high school and at university

I can see how my parents had no clue how to meet my emotional needs as a kid. They are very loving people and always wanted the best for me, they probably didn't give my parents the best emotional confirmation either, so I honestly feel that they did their best. A split second after realizing their role in my problems, I forgave them. They might have been weak, but certainly not evil. Forgiveness can heal anything.

Locking up emotions made me dysfunctional in many areas of life. Socially, relationship freak-outs and exes that wanted me to go into therapy make perfect sense now.

I experienced the crisis as a sign that my life was falling apart. Actually

Aside from r/ihaveissues, a few good friends and a professional coach at work. Today, it feels like everything is mixed up into a single process, where everything helped in a different way.  I didn't try cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it may work well for someone else. Get all the help you can think of.

I used to project a very strong and successful image. This was my coping strategy - my way of gaining acceptance when I was a kid. I have started showing my feelings to friends and family. I am no longer strong in every situation

My grandmother is very ill and may not survive the summer. She is very old and weak and wants to die

I thought that I was a very analytical person

Being strong also meant that I was very unforgiving towards myself. Nothing but perfection was acceptable. I am starting to accept my humanity and to forgive my own mistakes

I am a 29 year old male, at them and the world in general. All my friends have 'scored' and being left out is another reason why I dislike them. As a kid while growing up, my parents never said ""I love you"" or nice things to me. (Though I am sure my parents are proud of me, since I finished college, and now pursuing a masters in electronics and communication at one of the top 10 universities in the US). 

I have very few friends whom I consider close. Outside, I go to movies. But on in the inside, my loneliness is eating away my soul. I also have a slight weight problem, due to which I think I will never get a girl. When preparing for grad school, I met a girl in the tutoring center. She was the **one** girl, I truly believed I would be happy with, in my life. It was as if by sheer magic that our thoughts matched with each other. I have never been with **anyone** so compatible before. Never. 

We quickly became friends and I helped her a lot in her applications and essays. She also got great admits, she is single. A little while later, she has this big crisis in life and she called me up at the middle of the night, she cried inconsolably on the phone. We talked until the sun rose that morning. My feelings for this girl were getting stronger by the day and when I finally told her about my feelings, she said she was already seeing someone, from even before we met. She said she lied to me because she was not comfortable confiding in me about her relationship status. WTF!! If she was seeing someone else, why the fuck did she call me in the middle of the night to talk to me for the whole fucking night. Where was her fucking boyfriend then ?? I felt like I was used. I almost lost my faith in the female sex that day when I was rejected by her. The last I heard about her

So now almost 7 months later, sweet girl and I am dying to ask her out. Maybe she won't be as nasty as the previous girl. But I am 100000% sure she won't go out with me. She is gorgeous, I am gawky and socially awkward. She is a hurricane, I am a drizzle. Why should she, after all ?

Yes

I just want to know what's wrong with me. I am a caring, I seem to never make a lasting impression on anyone. People seem to like me, but no one ever loves me the way I want to be loved. For once in life, I want to be loved, to be wanted. Is that too much to ask ? 

I think no matter what one says about beauty, inner beauty is all that is left in the end while outer beauty fades, but fact is, it is outer beauty which attracts people at the first place. Without outer physical beauty, I am no one. No one would ever date me or love me. This feeling is building up inside of me ever since I can remember. Sometimes I feel if I should just pay for sex and get over with it. But then, I believe in emotional love making with the person you love the most, not in just paying money for sex. And yeah, I am Asian Indian and chicks in the US may not prefer that

Is there any hope for me at all ? Is there any reason to believe that one day I too would be loved by someone who won't care about my looks but only about how good I am as a person ?

But once I get comfortable and she starts showering me with endless affection, I get bored. Yeah, I know. I'm an asshole. But I really don't want to be. I just want them to be happy, and it sickens me that I can't find it within me to keep it going.

I'm currently in a relationship that's on a ""downward trend"" for my interest. I don't know if it's possible to save at this point. I don't want to lead her on. So

Just a little background, and she doesn't mind that. She needs some space, too. We spend the night together only 2-3 times a week. But even that's starting to feel like too much. But back when we first started dating... hell, I would have seen her every day of the week if I could.

The issue is that I have zero relationship experience.  I have a few first dates under my belt and once at a party a girl sat on my lap.  I haven't even been kissed.  

It is awkward since all three of my roommates have girlfriends and I made up a lie about how my summer fling ended.  (Kinda true I went on a date with a girl over the summer and tried numerous times over the summer for a 2nd date to no avail. ) 

Well the sex conversation came up and I had nothing to add

I was once honest about my virginity when it was revealed through a game of ""never-have-I-ever"".  When I went outside to smoke a cigarette (now a nonsmoker) I could hear one of the girls in my social group cackling with laughter and talking to someone on her cellphone and I heard her say my name.  I filled in the blanks about what the conversation was about.  

Fast forward to last weekend.  I went bar hopping with some of my new found friends.  Among them was a girl who was into me.  We had talked and hung out previously and while I found her attractive

Well she ended up back at my dorm room that night.  She layed down on my bed and I did something stupid.  I sat down and turned on the TV.  Within a few minutes she is saying she is tired

Deep down I felt like I did this because I wanted to lose my virginity to someone I was in love with

My partner died some five years ago, which I did.  However she died about a year ago.  I gave up work to look after my partner and I haven't worked since, I had lots of money so I didn't need to, and I didn't want to.

After her mum died there was a sense of relief that I was free from the sense of responsibility, or even kissed anyone, for more than five years.  I suspect this is part of my anger.

Since the age of 15, I get bored, I end it (with much difficulty). Rinse and repeat. The longest period I've had of singleness dates about 2 weeks. I feel pathetic when I think about it, but the truth is: I try. I really try. I finally break up with a guy who I've been leading on for years...then cue all these men gunning for me...combined with my deep-rooted psychological need for attention and assurance, as well as my complete and total lack of experience in how to live without an SO, I end up with one of them. Right away. It's horrible.
I seriously have NEVER lived alone, to be there for me, pick me up when I need, understand me, let me cry, etc. Seems like what everyone would ever want, right? And all of these guys were incredible, outstanding boyfriends. If love was a mathematical equation
So yes, alone, and be content. With who I am, without the context of a man. It's sad yet important to mention that with all of my boyfriends (I've, at this point, gone through about 6 of them incredibly seriously — the whole ""I'm gonna marry him"" deal. Each and every time. Ugh) I've more or less ""molded"" to the kind of person that would be ideal for them. I mean, honestly, in accordance to each guy. I'm going to make up names here for sake of anonymity, 1 year. I've literally molded to all of these people. It's fucking insanity. I have absolutely NO IDEA what kind of person I would be if I had been single all this time. I have no idea who I am
I've always been that girl with a boyfriend. That girl who gets invited places by friends (potential great friends) but doesn't want to go because she'd rather spend another night doing the same old-same old with my boyfriend. I've been ridiculed (in a mostly joking manner) by my family...they've turned predicting my love life and relationship status into a running joke/game they play. ""How long will XXX last before she dumps him and brings home the next one!? LOL!"" They've decided that ""Maneater"" is my theme song and sing it to me almost every time we're together. Even in front of my boyfriends. Needless to say
I can talk about how much all of the above is a problem for me forever
ANYWAYS. Fast forward to now: here I am. I was in a serious relationship (about 1 year), and fall asleep alone every night. (I have a serious dependency on the presence of someone in my bed at night to sleep next to --- sleeping alone scares the shit out of me.) The long distance relationship: skyping, texting, you know the drill — just wasn't cutting it. A few months into being here by myself, I met a new guy through friends at work. We are still dating. It's been about 11 months. He's extremely good to me, protects me, loves me unconditionally
I should mention that I'm a serious hopeless romantic. I'm one of those sappy ass fellas who believes that an honest-to-zeus fairy tale of love is out there waiting for me. Soul mates and shit. I'm still waiting for it, but it never lasts. And now this current relationship. I don't see it lasting into the long distance future, in otherwords: I'm positive I won't marry him. I feel in my gut that I shouldn't be with him, that I'm hurting him. That I'm on the precipice of disaster to his heart. That he'll end up going like all the rest of the guys in my life. The ones I break up with every damn time with the same ass ""excuse:"" (it's honestly not an excuse) ""I need to develop the ability to be independent, I've never been single, I don't know who I am.""

1334222285.0,s5xm6,Trying to fill the void and why it fails,,14,0,7,"Male (30) here. What I’m looking for with this post are people who have been or are in the same situation as I am and share ideas and thoughts. So here is my story

I’ve been in a relationship for almost 9.5 years. My ex ended it about 2 years ago and she is now a happy mother and soon to be married. I feel happy for her and I’m still in contact with her. But although I don’t have a problem with my ex (or want her back or whatever) this relationship left me damaged and I think I recently realized in what way.

I’m not a very outgoing person but (as I have been told numerous times) a rather attractive guy. So in those 2 years as single I never went to a bar/club/whatever to chat up girls and when I’m around new people I’m usually rather quiet. When I get to know people I usually warm up and start talking. I have lots of friends, got interested and everything, we had fun together, had sex, … and in the end I would always get “friendzoned”. All this happens in a time frame of roughly 2-3 months. And afterwards I would always be heartbroken and depressed.

Of course it could be absolutely possible that there never was a chance for a relationship, I totally go out of my way to meet her, spend time with her, treat her like princess, cancel plans I had with other people, even plan my free time around the possibility(!) that she might(!) want to do something with me. Now assuming all those girls where all well adjusted people I think it’s not surprising they bailed out. Why? Because it is just too much! I think that treating someone like this puts a huge pressure on the other person to “give back”... but how can you give back so much without giving up your own live to a degree that is just unhealthy? The strange thing is, I wouldn’t want that, thereby ruining my chance of finding a well-adjusted, smart girl. I guess I’m kind of lucky that all the girls I met where like that and that I didn’t meet an emotional vampire who would have loved sucking away my energy and then leaving me.

Don’t get me wrong! I don’t want to learn how to be a douche bag. I am and always will be a “nice guy”. I don’t have a problem with that and I’m not looking for the kind of girl who wants a guy who treats her like a piece of furniture. I want a confident

The thing that just drives me nuts is that whenever I am in a situation like this I seem to loose any capability of being able to judge where I should draw the line. I start thinking about everything I do, I’m just not myself anymore. I have no problems of saying “no” to a friend when I don’t want to do something. I have no problems to chose what I want to do when asked by a friend. I just do what I want to do, make compromises when I want to or I really don’t care one way or the other and I never had any problems with any of my friends in any way. But whenever I am around “that special person of the time” it seems like “my self” shuts down and I have to remote control someone through a video game I don’t know the rules or goals of. Seriously, who would want to be with someone like that?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you get over it? Did it happend by the realisation alone or did you do something specific? Are you in a similar situation and disagree with what I think? Any ideas

I work with her so trying to ask her out or something is not an option. I estimate I have like a 70% chance of rejection and her giving me the ""we're just friends"" speech and then things will be awkward and I can't avoid her.

I’ve dated a few girls over the years, although it was fairly obvious she didn’t reciprocate. I ended college without managing to make a fool out of myself by hitting on her, but it took me a while to get over it. I went through the classic ‘white knight’ phase with regards to my understanding of relationships with women.

By this point I was still essentially a virgin. At 22 I had a brief summer romance with a girl around the same age, but she eventually persuaded me. Unfortunately being my first time we didn’t really get past third base, and the relationship didn’t last long enough to make many attempts at changing that. She spent a lot of it crying, and when she finally broke it off with me I found it a relief.

A few years later I’d been dating another girl for a few weeks; things seemed to be going well, but when she called to break it off I tried to be understanding. I was less so when I met her at a friends wedding a few months later, to find her engaged to her ex. I chalked it up to experience.

I’ve known a few girls in the years since, hit it off with her. 

Things went well; we moved from club to club, decided he wanted her instead. I warned him off several times, but I…don’t do confrontation well. Eventually I left the club rather then start a fight with him, and somehow ended up in my car trying to calm down. She found me later, and after a lot of talking, things moved to the back seat. She initiated…but somehow I couldn’t go through with it, and stopped her before the point of no return. I don’t know if it was religious conviction

A few months ago I met a very attractive girl

…which is when I panicked. I knew we weren’t going to work out from the time we’d spent together; despite the attraction our backgrounds were way too different (e.g; Christian vs. spiritualist). I broke it off rather then risk sleeping with her (and then breaking it off after). I told myself it was the noble thing to do

So here I am; 29-and-going-on-30, but Christians tend to marry young. I’m nearly a decade older then most of the single women there. A part of me is terrified that I’ve been left behind, that I’m broken in some way. Nearly all of my friends are married or in long-term relationships.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve given online dating a whirl, if I’d ever be able to respect myself again.

Any advice appreciated.

I have found no way to satisfactorily merge them. If I'm single, inescapably, happens, independently of what I might feel for the partner in question. It never takes very long and I only have a limited ability to resist it - I can only delay it for a while, not avoid it.

I am not, and it took me two years of constant guilt over breaking the heart of my then-girlfriend before I could begin to see some light. I'm not looking forward to repeating this.

I was making out with a girl who I had been having a crush on for over a year. I told her I liked her, and I said that I hadn't. She asked why, and I said that I had never had any one night stands or anything like that (sounds like a stupid response, but it made sense because she already knew I had never dated or been in a relationship). I asked her why she was breaking up with her boyfriend, and she said it was because of me AND she wanted to see what it would be like to just be by herself (sounds messed up, doesn't it?). After talking a little more, she randomly said, and she just said “okay.”

In a nutshell, and she said “I don't know, maybe...” I was petrified when she said that, but I kept my cool because I didn't want to ruin anything between us. I told her how much I liked her, and that it was going to be hard to be just friends with her. She said, “yeah, I really fucked everything up

Now I don't want people to get the impression that she's a total bitch; she's one of the sweetest most awesome girls I've ever met and would never do anything to intentionally hurt me. She's a great person and a great friend. But yes

I have never been so self-conscious of my virginity until after this happened. I'm starting to realize now that pretty much everyone around me has turned in their V card at some point in time. Old people, awesome girls like her, friends within my age group, they've all most likely done it already. I always just figured I would do it with someone who I really liked and who liked me back. It took me a while to realize that, but that's basically it. So this is what “being patient” has done for me. Now the way I see it is that the older I get, the more of a curse my virginity is going to be.

I know that I probably could stand to have a little more confidence and just start asking girls out. But I don't really want to just do that in order to have sex. Or should I? I don't know, and I'm really worried that the next woman I get close to might get turned off by me being a relatively old virgin. And apparently, the first time isn't that great, so that scares me too. This all feels like something I wish I had taken care of as a teenager, so I feel really behind.

Any comments, etc. would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

Edit: I should probably mention that this incident happened quite a while ago. It's pretty clear now that she's not interested in anything more than friendship

My problem is that he was, but he is everything I ever wanted to be. Brilliant, motivated, successful, independent...everything.

But then he got bored with me and let me go. If he was just a friend, so it was too hard to cope with.

I can't be bothered doing anything anymore, but I don't. I'm so average, and I can't stand it. I try really really hard, but I just don't seem to succeed. I can't help but think that this is why he became bored of me. If this is the case, then nobody that interesting or amazing will ever love me...because I'll just bore them.

Everything I ever thought I was good at means nothing to me anymore, since he left, I've felt so unloved.

Like I'm forcing myself into having somebody because I can't hack it alone. Which might be true. I've never sought out dates before, and I really don't like it. However, I keep thinking that if I don't do this, and I know that it shouldn't BE a reason to feel bad

I'm sorry, as well as a perfect me. And he left. I feel that nobody will ever love me again. And that scares me. I want to be so much better than I am, but I don't know how.

Backstory - I've never had many friends. When I was in elementary-high school, people decided I wasn't worth hanging around. Yes, I am shy. Perhaps awkward as well, although I think I have a good sense of humor and quick wit, as well as many interests.

I met my ex-husband at the age of 18. We married at 20. He was very, I had none.

Now I'm 33. Divorced, although he has no issue at all with me having friends. But... I don't think I know how to make them! Even online. It seems like if I approach someone they aren't interested, or stop replying to emails, etc after a short time. I don't currently work outside the home, so this is another obstacle (work from home).

Does anyone know how people make friends at this age?

Context: I was with a girl whom I considered to be the love of my life for three years, I drove her to her counselling meetings every week, I took her to her blood tests, I took her for meals at her favourite restaurants, and basically was a large part of making her healthy again. Her parents didn't help at all, they tried to force feed her (physically), they would shout at her if she didn't eat, and her direct family (mother, and threats against my family.

We broke up because she cheated on me, remorseful, but only because she'd been found out, soon after, she started dating the lad who has gone after every ex of mine for the past 3 years, even after she said she would never go for someone like that - he's shorter than her and wears make up for fucks sake!

When things were good with her and I they were fucking awesome, we'd travel, we'd just go and do things on an impulse because that's who we were. But she threw that all away for cheating on me and then going out with this short, make up wearing arsehole. I even had an engagement ring, the one she'd fallen in love with. I still have it because I refuse to sell it for much less than what I paid for it. I even proposed to her, and she said 'yes' then, a few minutes later, everyone else thought she was single).

Since her, but the attention I have got, I've shunned. I don't want a mediocre, rebound relationship, even if it has been seven months. I don't want to settle. I want that adventure again, the impulsiveness, but with the faithfulness. There was one girl I got with, a few times, she was with a lad for a long time, she finds it hard to be close to anyone. So I don't want a relationship with her because I know it'll be toxic.

But I can't help but feel really fucking lonely, I have good looks, I'm a kind, fun, caring, impulsive, somewhat nuts kind-of person, a great family, why do I feel so many people are inadequate for me? I feel like I'd be toxic in a relationship simply because of having so much trust ruined

Because I have no current sources of affection or companionship(as has been the case throughout most of my life), but at the same time I have been crushed and hurt countless times by all of the women I have ever been with, and all the women who have ever looked me in the eyes and told me they loved me. I don't trust myself, and every woman I am attracted to I avoid, because I know I am just setting myself up to be broken again. 

I don't open up to people because to me opening up and trying to find someone who will love me is not worth the risk of being hurt again. I have attempted suicide in the past after break ups(flying across the country and standing in the snow for 6 hours before having the first girl I ever loved break up with me after a year-long distance relationship), and the other half wants the best for everyone, even for the people who may hate me.

Today the girl I have liked and been friend-zoned by for 15 years told me a story about one of her past sexual experiences, and will likely continue to be for many years to come, if not for the rest of my life, and partly because subconsciously I probably feel that I own her. She sends me nude pictures and then tells me she isn't interested in being with me or having sex. People tell me I shouldn't care or get attached, and should just move on, but I'm not that kind of person. I'm active on Seddit (so don't think about linking me there, because I have already watched all the videos, and tried out these tactics in real life with great success)

I don't hate myself. Many people automatically go to this assumption. I love myself more than anyone else ever will. I think I'm a wonderful person with a lot of great talents

I don't care about being rich, or handsome. If I had something to live for or someone to care about/to care about me I would try my hardest to have a better life, both for me and for them.

My first reaction is ""Maybe I'm ugly?"" Personally, which was pretty unfair, to be honest. Average height, average weight. I work out when I can. At home, I dress comfortably, but when I go out, I dress well for the occasion. I might not dress like a trendy super model but I don't dress like a slob. I don't put on a lot of make up, and jewelry. My girlfriends tell me that I look pretty or beautiful

Then I think about myself. I am a nerd, I love sci-fi and fantasy stories (Doctor Who and LotR... big fan), but I don't flaunt it to the heavens. I'll openly admit it but it's not like my world revolves around it. But I also like a few guy stuff like ice hockey, Top Gear (I'm slowly learning about cars), a bit of football... like I'm not fully knowledgeable about it, but if a guy is a fan of these topics, he'll undoubtedly still know more. And there there's the ""girly"" stuff, clothing, there's the rest of me that include, photography

I'm fairly confident in myself. Like I'll easily flaunt a bikini even though I know I don't have a perfect body or I'll readily jump at the chance to karaoke even though I know I'll make a fool out of myself. Usually, not sure why, but I guess it's because if I need to stand up for myself or get something done, I do it... unless if it's a situation where a guy can open this damn pickle jar quicker than I have the patience to open it! Har, har. In my defense, I'm not going to wait for someone to rescue me like some damsel in distress. Which leads me to this point: I'm not an easy girl. Although, my close friends do exhibit these traits

And there's probably a few questions about the overwhelming number of the 2 dates I've been on... Apparently, and about politics (that's a no-no topic with me). A bit awkward all around.

I see the pretty girls on my FB post photos of other fit girls, ""Oh that must be nice, to need motivation to lose *maybe* 5 fucking lbs.""  Even the girls posting on reddit ""Finally got the courage to wear a two-piece, no fucks given!"" and what do I see? Beautiful, normal, healthy girls.

As I said

But emotionally... things start to get blurry. 

I should also mention that I've recently accepted that I'm probably a serial dater too. I haven't had many boyfriends... but since I was 16 I've pretty much always had a boyfriend. There were two pretty long-term (2 and 3.5 years) relationships in there, when I'm in a relationship I feel like I am fearless... I'm happier. And I'm not entirely sure that's a bad thing. I love myself. And I love to love other people. And I love when other people love myself too. I'm not a dependent person by any means, but I am very symbiotic. **I'm okay with this.** 

Also


But in every single serious relationship, full-blown ""I could potentially love this person"" feelings. The tricky part is, these feelings never diminished the feelings I had for the guy I was with. I felt like I cared about, wanted to be close to, cuddle with, etc. both of them. I have no idea how to turn it off. It really blows my mind that people can have feelings for one person and one person only.

Which brings me to my current situation. I am in a relationship with a guy I care very much about. It's long-distance at the moment but that's only temporary and I can't wait to go be with him in a few weeks. We text, who I met very briefly. We exchanged numbers because we had a few things in common and his roommate is a mutual friend. He is also several states away. But we text, a lot. Nothing inappropriate or sexual... just getting to know you conversation. And I really, really like him. I miss him even though I hardly know him. I want to cuddle with him and hold his hand. And I can't wait too feel my boyfriends lips. My heart picks up whenever I get a text from either one of them.

I know the ""right"" thing to do is to cut off contact with the ""other"" guy. Or break-up with my boyfriend. But I absolutely hate both of those options. It's like I wish I could be split into two people. Why is it an either-or choice?

This isn't the first time I've felt this way. And

I'm 26/m. Been involved in only one serious relationship for two years, my ex went through some serious insecurity issues and cheating issues with her ex. By this I mean she slept with her ex while dating me.

Finally distangled myself, losing weight, soaring really high in my new job (flying a lot, handling regional level duties).

One thing bothers me though. From young, after my break up, I have always been infatuated very easily.

Meeting a new girl for a short 2-3 hours and having a good time with them easily makes me feel infatuated. I often feel ""happy"" or ""satisfied"" if I have a ""target"" girl that I like. If I don't have a ""target"" girl, I will remember that girl when I see cute things or knick knacks that she may like, little things remind me of ""her"", etc.

Am I that desperate? Am I that sad?

And yet, but I know my strong points. I know that I am good with words, I can think on my feet. I know how to make people laugh, and I'm not afraid to compliment people, guys or girls, when appropriate.

If you trust my own judgement of myself, not afraid to meet new people and have fun.

Note: When I say I look at myself with disgust or shame, I used to suffer from low self-esteem. Now I'm successful in my career, I'm losing weight and working out, I have an active social life, and I know that several girls have expressed an interest in me.

Still possible to have a low self-esteem, in the sense that I wonder whether I have not grown up fully? Or whether I am lacking something in my life, something in my childhood that is affecting me so?

Sorry for the wall of text. I hope that you read

**This first part is laying a back story or foundation:**

I was in therapy for a while for abuse. I currently cant afford it, physically, and emotionally abusive. He is also very manipulative and cunning with his words. His biggest pride is his honesty and integrity. That as a salesman (that's his profession), he can make a sale without having to lie. He is now out out my life and I rarely speak with him.

What I have come to realize is that when I was younger, down to the slightest movements (even breathing and eye rolling), and to watch what/how/when I spoke to avoid run ins with my dad. And at times I manipulated him or my mom to get out of trouble, being more successful as I got older. I no longer need these 'skills' for survival, but they remain. 


I also can craft a lie (or web of lies) on the spot without any planning or forethought (again, if there's something shady going on I will be the first to come clean, even if it makes me the jerk. I'd rather know that I was truthful. On rare times when I am confronted I always have a flash of believable lies/stories that will get me in the clear, but I have to push them aside to tell the truth.


I think that from acting/talking my way out of trouble with my parents is how I subconsciously began employing these tactics in everyday life. All day, and pathos). I don't actively plan out what I will say to get what I want, it just happens. Many times I am half aware of what I'm doing, and just go with it, with the thought of ""if you cant beat 'em, the join 'em"" mentality. Sometimes I am able to catch myself crafting my every word and movement to get what I want, and I feel gross and helpless and go into depression and lock myself away. 

So, and I tell them that all they have to do is ask. What my friends don't realize is that there's more. I can't explain it. I just do it. And my friends don't realize that I do it to them. I try not to, but it happens.

**The next part is the purpose behind my post

A few months ago I lost the love of my life because I made the terrible choice of choosing to lie rather than tell the truth (this was the first time since I cold turkey'd it). It was a harmless happening where I wouldn't have been in the dog house or anything for giving her the truth. I was tired, I figured 'there was nothing to hide so I'll just stick with this story because at the core it doesn't matter'. Of course I felt like shit and I came clean a few days later. Her position was why lie over something so insignificant, there must be something more that you're not telling me. I have to agree that she maked sense. Anyways, thats when our relationship made a turn for the worse. A month later we broke up and I found myself (mostly unconsciously, sometimes consciously) manipulating, controlling, and plotting to win her back. I even found myself triggering tears at opportune moments. When to blow my nose. When to stop talking for delayed silence (phone or in person). What questions to ask, when to ask for a hug, knows that I hate when I do it. I try so hard to not manipulate



**TL;DR**

* I learned to craft master lies

* I now manipulate/control everyone to get what I want.

* I lost the love of my life because of it.

* Losing her

Before I start, dad, little sister and I) and we are your average joe, middle class folks, nothing special. I'm 5'2"" and 125lbs (so my weight is average). My family immigrated from Sri Lanka when I was 5 years old and I did all of my schooling in North America. When I was little, I was enthusiastic and playful, I looked ""normal"" and everyone was my friend. However, I started to gain weight and by 2nd grade, got good grades, with her help and my mom's motivation

After starting university, but I don't do as much ""personal care"" as I probably should be doing. I'm pretty darn average... there is literally nothing extraordinary about me.

Anyways, in Engineering with me, so it's not too bad I guess. About him though... we used to be like two peas in a pod. Now, I can't even imagine what he saw in me that made him think that we were ""alike"" ... in fact, I don't think that he even thinks so anymore. After almost two years of feeling like a misfit, I'm asking for help now. I want to be normal. My boyfriend prides himself on being a ""normal guy"" so I want to be a ""normal girl"" because I think thats what he wants me to be. I think that's what everyone wants me to be if I'm going to form any kind of relationship with them (i.e. friendships). My problems are these though, to name a few:

* I don't laugh at sexual jokes as much as my boyfriend does/normal people do (like on reddit)
* I don't like porn (never seen it, I don't fap (or schlick, in my case...) *but* I do fantasize about doing romantic things with my bf (and I *do* enjoy it when we do things like that irl)
* I like video games (and my boyfriend does too
* I don't find ""normal"" movies funny (like ""Get Him To The Greek"" and other stuff)
* I don't ""check other guys out"" or even acknowledge their existence
* I don't talk to many guys
* I feel like I am the definition of a SAP (Socially Awkward Penguin... see [/r/AdviceAnimals](/r/AdviceAnimals) )
* I feel like I am also a Paranoid Parrot ( see [/r/AdviceAnimals](/r/AdviceAnimals)  again)
* I don't have the money for designer clothing/makeup 
* I am not very ""girly""... to this day
* I'm not fashionable/pretty (I'm serious
* I am not allowed to have social networking (my parents feel that it is bad for me
* I am a great believer in God but everyone I know seems to think that it's a stupid thing to do so I keep quiet and try to assimilate (but I usually fail because I just can't talk poorly of my religion... I have too much respect for it)
* I am a great believer in my culture/traditions but again
* I don't believe in modern relationship views (like being 100% independent) but my boyfriends seems to want this from me very much so I try (but often fail because of how happy I get when I act like my true self)
* I'm ""derpy"" and my boyfriend finds me embarrassing 90% of the time after we started seeing each other in real life (we were in a long distance relationship for 1 year; at the moment
* I'm socially stupid and I'm constantly wishing that I was able to fit in
* I'm not funny (or at least, the things that everyone else finds funny (including my bf), I usually don't find funny but I don't want to be a bad sport so I fake it and laugh along anyway)

Just... things like that. I want to be normal. I want my boyfriend to not be embarrassed by me. I want to be approachable, if no one else because he's the one I love the most, no matter how many bad things happen to me while I'm with him... 

Do you have any advice on how I can be (or at least, gets told that she's embarrassing, annoying or weird in some way when she didn't mean to be any of those things at all. I apologize so much to my boyfriend, too. I feel that I have to. I even make a list of ""things that are ok to do"" and ""things that are not ok to do"" so I can remember (these are all based on experiences I've had; they are things my boyfriend likes/dislikes about me and the way I behave). 

Please,"" Reddit. I am sick of being me. I hate me. Everyone hates me and you know what, I DON'T BLAME THEM.

Even a few insights... maybe ones related to the points above (and how to fix those problems) would be so very much appreciated. I just want to be accepted by the one I love the most, at least.

Hi. First

I'm a 21-year-old heterosexual male currently working through college and being quite successful at it. By and large, dealt with a bout of depression in late high-school (~ age 17) but not really anything beyond typical teenage angst. I consider myself a good communicator, a good speaker, and a smart guy and, depending on my mood and the state of my acne, I'd put myself in the top 50-30% on physical attractiveness. My third year of college is now winding down and it looks like I'll maintain my 3.9 GPA without much of a sweat. I have frequently been very happy because I'm an introvert and so can entertain myself. But other times I’m not so happy. 

Part of my hesitation from asking for help or advice with the problems I'm about to lay out is that I really feel like I shouldn't complain-- like all my problems are ""first world problems"" and that I ought to suck it up and count my blessings. I know what I ought to do and I know I can do it

Now on to the meat of the matter. 

I am a creature of habit. And I have been for years. A lot of people talk about college as a time of transition and social learning. While I have changed a lot in some ways in my 3 years at university, “Who is my best friend?” Although I could easily think of a few candidates, they were really just really good acquaintances or “playmates” (in the nonsexual, 6-year-old child sense of the word). Then I had sort of a revelation: I am no one’s best friend. I don’t think anyone would count me as their number one friend and I might be lucky to even make the top three.  

Hold that thought. We’ll come back to it. 

In related news, in an attempt to avoid sounding shallow, most of them had other incompatibility issues keeping me from returning their affection). I really think I’m pretty good at handling social situations as they come at me, but not very good at the proactive part-- that is, getting the ball rolling. 

This ties in to my situation with my non-romantic relationships. I have this bizarre since of propriety -the same sense that keeps me from asking for help- that tells me the most polite and proper thing to do is maintain the status quo

The respectful distance I maintain with other people has served me excellently in my academic career, but I have never shown any strong emotion towards him. Why should he open up first? 

So, I’d really like to have a “friend with benefits.” I think that’d be fantastic because I don’t really need other people to feel fulfilled. But I know that that deeper connection must feel great. I know what it’s like to be loved and to love someone else (My parents). It is really great. But I haven’t felt that feeling in a long time. 

I sort of expect people to say “She asked you about homework? Just ask her out!” I don’t even know what “ask out” really means. I mean, I’m not 9-out-of-10, and the person I’m talking to isn’t batting her eyelashes and tugging her hair obviously interested.

I have a significant other that I'm in a good relationship with and I have a good job that I enjoy, although this can vary.

In the past three weeks or so, before I get in my car to drive somewhere, I have to have a mental conversation where I convince myself that I'm not going to get into an accident that will kill or paralyze me.  Lately, if I get on an elevator, I become extremely fearful that it will fall with me inside and kill me, but I internalize this feeling and I doubt anyone else on the elevator could tell by looking at me that I'm silently panicking.  However, if I find myself on the elevator alone, keys, I'm having a lot of trouble getting myself to close my eyes to go to sleep because I'm afraid of not waking up.

Some other background information might be helpful.  About seven years ago, my roommate was watching something on TV in another room while I was napping.  Someone on TV screamed really loudly, waking me up, and mentally taking me immediately back to when my Dad passed, putting me in a panic for a time.  I literally hopped up from where I had been napping and ran across my place in a daze to where the noise came from expecting to see something horrible.

I've heard before that a preoccupation with your own death is a sign of depression, but I was feeling fine mentally before these feelings started to onset.

I'm kind of at a loss about what to do.  I haven't made any efforts to start seeing a psychologist, but am starting to think that I need to.

Looking back on things, went to the gym, took photos, and went out with my friends. But after the break up she kept calling me to hang out, and because I was so lonely I would concede.

He yanked me out and I fell onto him as i tripped over the bath tub. He grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled me to the ground. I was so confused, trying to get traction to stand. He then pulled my head around to where the back of my neck was pressed against the bathtub and my face was getting splashed by the water. His forearm was pushed against my throat.

I remember the cop. He said ""You know

The first time it happened was with my first girlfriend in high school. That's no big deal

It happened again after we broke up and I went to college and met a new girlfriend who I fell in love with. We were together for about 6 months

Well, second time is a coincidence, no big deal. I tried not to let it get to me much and moved on. I eventually met another girl, with whom I shared a relationship of about 8 months. At that point, she got introduced to (who I now refer to as) my scumbag cousin, and began an affair. Shortly after I found out, she broke up with me and they ran off together. They're still together to this day. (First time is an accident, third time is enemy action. Sadly

Finally, she began dropping hints about marriage, so I asked her to marry me and she accepted. The marriage lasted less than a year, as it came to light that she had been cheating on me with multiple men, including her coworkers, and some of my now ex friends. Since the divorce, I have not pursued any new relationships, I feel as though all women are cheaters

1348163142.0,107aor,(25M) I’ve come to despise myself sexually and I’m not sure why.,yourderek,11,0,8,"  I believe when we look back on the events of our teenage years and adolescence, perhaps that feeling is only a defense mechanism against expressing dissatisfaction and want? I’ve come to second guess everything I say or think or feel

  Like so many people before me, my first everything – kiss, sex, everything. I had to endure watching her crush on other guys for the first few months of our friendship before we decided to go out. It was a situation I can look at now and realize I had no leverage. She knew I wanted to be with her since I had asked her so many times before, but after several guys she went out with and asked out didn’t carry on with her, she came to me. Eventually we agreed to call one another boyfriend and girlfriend and that was that.

  Now I weighed about 240 lbs when I was in high school, it’s certainly not obesity). It got worse as I went on through college and after I transferred out to follow her home. I got up to 290 lbs before it was decided I needed to make a change. She was patient and loving with me through all this and for that I can’t really imagine why. I deserved much less respect than I received from her.

  Eventually, she told me she wanted me to lose weight and I agreed. I have a low self esteem, I certainly won’t dispute that. I thought I would feel better about myself and she couldn’t wait to see “how sexy I would get.” I started counting points on weight watchers and eating healthier, avoiding fast food and after six months I’d lost 40 lbs, but I didn’t feel better. It eventually became clear to me that I didn’t just need to lose weight to feel better; I needed to lose weight to become the person that my girlfriend wanted to be with.

  We would go shopping and she would help me pick out clothes that looked good on me. To this day I appreciate what she gave me in the way of fashion sense. But she had a tendency to prefer tight clothing on me. Not that I don’t appreciate it aesthetically

  Unfortunately

  I should mention at this point that she had a fascination with pimples and black heads; her own, shoulders, stomach, back, etc and request of me to pop pimples on her own body inaccessible to her.

  Eventually it came that I would visit her or she would come to me and sit on my lap and lay with me in some intimate location and her first act would be to pop black heads on my face. I don’t mean to suggest I’m an acne-ridden goldmine to her. I actually have pretty good skin, creating redness and swelling that wasn’t there before. This was a compulsion of hers that I endured and indulged despite the painfulness of it and despite our crumbling physical connection I could feel escaping from every one of my pores.

  This escalated eventually to her applying make-up to my face before we would go out. She was evidently distracted by red patches or swelling and despite my passive protests she would apply it (even once reapplying it while at a dinner table in a restaurant). She would often criticize the way I kissed (it was too wet

  Our sex life really wasn’t that satisfying for me towards the end. I’m sure it was never satisfying for her and I still feel bad for forcing her to endure those years with me. I understand she felt affection for me and wanted to be with me for some period of time

  I don’t blame her for this and I’m happy for her now that she’s in a relationship and has what she wants. I’ve internalized most of my frustration and anger and I don’t see much of a reason to blame anyone but myself. We eventually agreed to have an open relationship after she left for graduate school. She lived in a city a couple hours away but I would continue to visit her

  I continued to visit her and we slept together every time, I put the pain I felt in the back of my mind and visited her to offer my sympathy and support. She wanted me to sleep with her, even as she cried about her insecurities and desire to be wanted. It was the end of the relationship, basically. We formally broke up a couple days before Christmas, though we continued to sleep together.

  This period of time was the most psychologically damaging for me. I vowed the day she told me about her other boyfriend that I was going to become a pescatarian (Vegetarian + Fish/Shellfish) and lose the weight I thought I couldn’t. Over the next six months I lost another 40 lbs and ultimately weighed in at the lowest weight of my adult life

  She described in disparaging language what it was like to sleep with me versus her former other boyfriend. I disgusted her not just in my physical appearance but in my body language, before or since, what I felt in that moment: total and complete abandonment.

  I’m certainly not void of blame myself. I could have read the tea leaves and removed myself from what was becoming a toxic situation. Particularly after learning she kept secret from me at least a couple relationships. But still, there was only 1 day that we didn’t talk to one another in our years together). I couldn’t imagine a life without her considering we essentially graduated adolescence together.

  After this moment our relationship dissolved entirely and eventually she just had another boyfriend. It’s hurt me in incredible ways that I’m still coming to understand. I don’t blame her for it

  Eventually, being there for her and helping her feel loved and wanted during the months she vented about other men’s sexual exploitation of her. But the problem became clear to me when I couldn’t take it any more. I was supporting her, but I was unable to ask support from her. I felt betrayed intrinsically. I couldn’t trust her with my emotions and I didn’t feel any longer that she cared for me or loved me. Eventually I broke down and begged her to stop talking about her boyfriend or sexual behavior with other men. I put on an emotional display of which I didn’t think I was capable; but when it went ignored and she sought me again for consolation and went into more detail than I needed to hear over sex with another man. I just had to accept that she wasn’t going to listen or change and I just stopped communicating with her.

  It hasn’t helped me, as though all the weight before it (80 lbs total) didn’t matter unless I lost another 20. We used to have a fairly difficult sexual relationship. Like so many other men before me, I really enjoy getting a blowjob. Unlike (it seems) so many other men… I don’t feel I ever deserve one. In fact, I don’t think I deserve any kind of sexual gratification or satisfaction.

  My ex-girlfriend would not volunteer to go down on me (can you blame her? At one point I was 290 lbs! I was despicable), she never actually got me off with her hand or mouth, though I will take the blame for this, I was too disgusting to go down on for long enough and didn’t deserve it anyway. Eventually, she would describe to me how other men she was with would tell her (either vocally or physically) to go down on them and told me I had to be more aggressive.

  She had also told me an anecdote about a guy who secretly ejaculated in her mouth and how she was upset about it. Whenever I would sleep with her I would visualize these other people with her

  Eventually, wishing I had a smaller frame, wishing I didn’t have gynecomastia, wishing I had fewer blackheads and pimples (I continue to pop these to this day, insecure that other people notice them as well as my ex did). I don’t feel satisfied with what I am, I can only see the deficit, I can only see where I’m falling short or where I don’t measure up. I’m not saying I have blinders on, or to constantly hide my faults.

  Interestingly

  It’s certainly something I’ve thought about since I realized it was so consistent. I wouldn’t characterize myself as a loner. In fact, I’ve written for free newspapers and contributed to literary magazines. I don’t hide and I’m not a recluse, I love being around people and in crowds. Going to concerts and house parties are some of my favorite things in the world to do but I really don’t care if anyone knows I’m there or knows I exist. I can enjoy being in a crowd without talking to a single person. I enjoy the atmosphere and the energy. I enjoy being in the middle of it all.

  At the same time, to recede. I didn’t want other people to know I existed or to know my name. When I was upset and depressed for about a year, I often fantasized about suicide and wished I could just disappear and everyone would forget I existed and no one would be bothered or upset about it. I don’t want my ex-girlfriend to live a life of misery. I want her to find happiness and satisfaction and I want her to move on and away from me.

  Even regarding sex, but it’s impossible. I want to work on my issues and become a person who’s comfortable with himself and his needs and wants, but it’s been so long since I felt comfortable asking for anything I don’t even know what I’d ask for.

I love everything about being in a relationship. The attention, just knowing everything about someone, being important to someone... I love being in a relationship. 

I won't be in a relationship with just anyone though... I'm so ridiculously picky when it comes to women. Which probably explains why I'm single for so long and find decent relationships when I do. (In one of my single spells as of March)

I don't get to date much. I'm shy

And here is where my story takes a sudden twist. I've recently had a girl pretty much fall in my lap. Someone I dated years ago. She knows everything about me. What makes me tick

Yet I'm hesitant. Aside from the glaring fact that she does have a  three year old son and an ex-husband. I don't know how I'd feel if those things weren't a factor. 

She can give me everything I want. She cares about me. She's sexually active

For someone who complains about being lonely all the time this baffles me. I want something more than her. And I feel like a huge jerk for feeling this way. 

I want her to stay around. The sex was phenomenal. She remembers all of my little buttons. Even buttons I had completely forgotten about. I enjoy her company, but I don't see anything long term that I would be happy with...

Now I have to tell her that I feel this way because I don't want to lead her on. And I don't know how she's going to react. Best case scenario - She's cool with just keeping things light. Worst being she flips out on me and never speaks to me again.

I figured I would post an update since posting here was the first tine I had shared what happened


Some of the things that I had left out in the original post were details about the depression. As much as I hate to admit it, scratching myself. I had also just let myself go pretty massively. Most days I had no will to even brush my hair. I would even go out in public wearing bleach stained t-shirts, house shoes, and Pajama pants. I didn't really care because what was the point? I was just an ugly girl and any attempt otherwise was just like putting lipstick on a pig. 


As soon as I spilled the details to my husband


He encouraged me to do things that made me feel better about myself. I started taking the time to do my hair or make up


There have been days where I even roll out of bed


My mom has also been encouraging me. She encouraged me to buy lingerie and dress up. I bought the lingerie and pumps for my husband's benefit. I nearly had a panic attack before I revealed myself to him. But it was worth it. His physical and verbal response was just... amazing. It was weird to so quickly go from absolutely hating myself to actually feeling sexy.

And all of these things have been a great boost to my confidence in every aspect. For the first time iin a long time

I'm not quite there yet but I really feel like I'm in the right direction.


My fears were met

A lot of emotions caused by that. With trying to improve my confidence I've been dressing nicely and getting dolled up before I go anywhere. I think that caught his attention and I almost feel like I won. Because he didn't see the shell of a person he intended to leave behind. He saw a woman that appeared to by fine

He tried to talk (we were on our way out) but I completely ignored him and kept walking to our car. My heart was pounding

My husband wanted to get out and just obliterate the guy but I insisted jail time was not worth this miserable excuse of a man. My husband said things like ""at least now I know what that piece of shit looks like for future reference"" but I don't believe he would do anything. 

The aftermath of that is that I am somewhat scared that he will try to find me. I know he gets a thrill from fuckin people's lives up and if he thought he could fuck mine up again

So then I realized that he cannot ruin my life. He cannot put a wedge between my husband and I. He cannot undo the beautiful children we have - or even the one I am currently pregnant with.

He may have created a lot of pain.. but he **cannot** erase the happiness and satisfaction I have since gained.


And I think that finally liberated me. I think that finally made me stop believing that he controls me and I cannot explain how amazing that is. He is nothing. He is finally nothing.


I didn't even hate myself after seeing him. If he does try to contact me


So, but that doesn't overwhelm me. I feel okay.. I'm more affectionate and sexual now and that is only improving my already wonderful marriage. Ran into the ex and realized he can't harm me aanymore. **

I just had a (hopefully) life changing epiphany and I wanted to share it with you here in case there is someone else having similar issues. Just something to think about. It seems obvious now

Two years ago I lost my passion. The subjects of my passion are ultimately irrelevant and not the focus of this post

I used to be passionate about history. How did I know I was passionate about this subject? I realized that my thoughts would always drift back to it. If I was talking to someone

I loved history. I got excited about it. I went to college to study it. I wanted to be an archaeologist and interact with history. **The point is my passion was a positive one

Well roughly two years ago my passion started to die. I didn't know why. Suddenly I wasn't happy anymore. Meanwhile my personal life was collapsing around me. Three year relationship in shambles, moving to a new state and losing all my friends/connections, shit sucked. I was (not surprisingly) deeply depressed.

It was during this time that my passion started to shift. I thought it was vanishing

My new passion turned into religion and politics. I had always been interested in these topics

**These new topics made me furious.** I was filled with rage and a lot of other negative emotions whenever I thought about these two topics. (Specifically the injustices and atrocities committed under their umbrellas) They became my passions, and since they became my default, I was angry all the time.

**My new ""passion"" was a very negative one

I believe this was a reflection of what I was experiencing at the time in my personal life. During this period I felt very listless and adrift. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I no longer had a passion and thus no direction.

This was because my anit-passions had no productive ends. When I loved history, nothing to strive for and accomplish.

What I have to do now is find something that I love and somehow make that my new passion. I'm not sure how to do that yet

I hope this helps anyone in a similar situation. If you figure out how to rekindle a positive passion let me know!

So i'll try and keep this short and to the point.

I didn't want to have sex with him because I felt he should know how messed up I am before making that leap and commitment in our relationship.

However I ran out of excuses and I couldn't find it in myself to say ""No"" so I let it happen anyway and now I am racked with guilt.

I have been in several abusive relationships and I have also been raped.

I also have Autism (my bf knows I am Autistic)

Due to an emotionally abusive relationship at a young age and I believe partially due to the Autism I lost a lot of my self worth and felt like I was only good for sex - despite being a virgin.

This led to me developing an extremely unhealthy view of myself and allowing myself to get into stupid situations

As a consequence I have let myself suffer through a lot of shit and I really don't feel like I am worth anything at all.

I constantly feel dirty and disgusting after sex

My boyfriend is so kind

I do not think I am worth the gifts

I had to fight tooth and nail to be able to pay for Macdonalds which so far is the only thing he has let me pay for.

I hate seeing him go short to try and please me when I don't even want the things he gets me

I feel guilty that he buys me things and I feel guilty and disgusted with myself for letting him do that and for letting him touch me in any sort of intimate way.

I have told him I don't like him buying me things and that he doesn't need to compliment me but he just says he is treating me the way I deserve to be treated.

I feel like shit also because he is totally open and honest with me about his past and things he has been through whereas I have put a 10ft thick brick wall.

I recognised that I have a tendency to act up in order to push people a way so I have purposefully been keeping myself in check so as to not let this happen.

Instead though it seems like I am just avoiding talking to him so as to avoid pushing him away.

Now I feel like the relationship has reached a point where I have to tell him this stuff about me otherwise i'll just push him away and I really don't want to do either of those things.

So: **tl;dr How do I tell my bf I let him stick his dick in a crazy?**

1331135435.0,qltyt,Feelings of rejection intensify as I get closer to others,,12,2,18,"(This is x-posted from /r/relationship_advice as I was hoping to get more response.)

Hi all

It's been a long time for me to realize this (M26) and it pertains to my relationship (F24) but also many other aspects of my life

**The conditions**

I realized that as I grow close to people, when they ultimately ask for a little space (flake out, fail to reciprocate, don't return calls/txts, etc.), I wind up feeling completely rejected and kicked-to-the-curb. Cancelled plans are probably the worst but even other things like getting skipped over on invitations causes great envy in me. I internalize my rejection to a great deal, to the point that I'm *absolutely certain* that people hate me, and think I'm annoying

People generally perceive me (at first) as friendly, and outgoing. I always walk away from time with friends feeling recharged and with a positive outlook. After long enough, though, things seem to slip. As instances crop up where they can't make it out or otherwise, I find myself feeling cast aside in their lives, as if they've used my time and now they're sick of me... or perhaps they were sick of me all along and were just keeping face. I feel like I do a LARGE majority of initiation, like 70-80% of the time, I'm the one who later says

Another funny --possibly relevant-- thing is that gift giving does not build relationships for me at all. Whereas others like giving and receiving gifts

I also ""reject myself"" and feel great hurt. Even little things, how I'm worthless, and (for whatever reason) selfish.

The last thing is that I tend to stay in relationships too long. My tendency to ""stick-it-out"" in romantic relationships leads to months of staying with a partner who makes me feel shitty and depressed. All my dating history has been LTRs (average of probably 1 year each). I don't even try to resolve issues in the relationship, &lt;A girl&gt; does this, but it's okay because I don't earn much money (or) I don't have a car (or) I don't have an excellent body.""

**The history**

For a long time I wondered if it's me or them, and my step-father who raised me is also separated from my mom. The only other possibly traumatic experience I can mention is that one of my best friends took his life in high school. It was a hard experience for me, hardly eating or sleeping for weeks and crying every day. However, I felt like it was a time of closeness and I felt good that many of my friends were there to support each other. 

I've wondered if these experiences could, lest they could vanish in a moment's notice. This would explain why I expect my friendships to sublimate from the occasional happy hour to spending days together on end. As if my strategy is to either immediately get close or prevent myself from getting close.

I was a ""serial monogamist"" in the past

However, if anything I'm now harsher about it because I've been through it and have absolutely no sympathy for any party who engages in cheating.  That is to say, I have absolutely no sympathy for myself, although I think the other parties involved should have tried not to be.

My current problem with guys is based on the primary observation that most guys I considered friends, I had lost some people I considered good friends (although later I realize they probably weren't that good of friends).  As I tried to start dating again, the overt desire to eventually sleep with me before even knowing me just pushed me further away.  And the guys I met through friends (usually at a party) seemed to be out for the same thing, if anything at least they were more upfront about wanting that threesome right away.

I started to feel that men were only interested in me as a sexual object, and the guy friends I once had dwindled to pretty much nothing due to having retreated after rejection.  I think I now have a full-blown self-perpetuating paranoia that I think is entirely unhealthy and not helping me move forward.

So... okay.  Guys do want sex.  Humans want sex.  No surprise.  But I don't.  Not right now.  Especially not from any of the guys who I feel are ""after"" me.

For all the work I've put into getting my life in order, never making it past first. The issue started weighing on me around the time I finished university

If it makes any difference at all, with an aim to speed up dealing with the mortgage. It's as much a financial thing as it is a cultural thing. I have no religious beliefs that keep me away from sex, though I don't believe in casual sex, a stance which is sort of wavering because of the lifelong drought. Getting professional help with it is out of the question, since I know I wouldn't be able to live with the thought that I'm so unwanted that the only way I'll ever get any is if I pay for it. I've been reading up on dating materials (not PUA stuff), and trying to apply the stuff on flirting and being romantic, albeit without much luck so far.

I've always had trouble interacting with other people. I hate to say that I only have new friends (and am not too close with the notable exception). In pretty much every social circle I've ever been in things would 'end' eventually

I’m 19 male and feel I’ve wasted my childhood on video games and anime instead of doing the ‘exciting’ things kids typically do. Not because I avoided it but because my social skills and attitude were so bad that almost nobody liked me. I hardly went to any parties in high school and these days when I go out to drink I feel myself resisting the urge to spew depressing thoughts and almost always fail. And that’s probably the main problem.

I almost always have a bad feeling about something. When I take away all the self affirmations and pick-me-ups and happy mental routines I organized in my head there’s self pity through the roof. My default facial expression looks angry so whenever I just need somebody to talk to I give the impression that I want to kill everything in sight.

I tried stifling these negative thoughts with sheer mental force because I don’t want people to think of me as a downer, I’m not, and I’m familiar enough with others who behave like that to see why it was so off putting.

It’s been a year since I finished high school and that day I made it a personal goal to “fix” myself and put my life where I really wanted it. I hit the gym, and a year later I can observe my situation between two extremes, depending on the mood I’m in.

When I’m feeling good, I’m hardwired to my destructive patterns and I’ve already seen the full extent of where my life can go in those moments of humiliation and exclusion.

I’m going away for a month in less than two weeks and will be meeting a ton of new people

I'd rather be in a romantic relationship with a guy. The problem is I'm barely physically attracted to men (only &lt;&lt; 1% of guys). Now I know this sounds extremely shallow, regardless if I find them attractive or not.


My close male friends believe I have high standards and I should lower them. And I'm repressing my feelings about sex/intimacy. I have tried giving the only 5 guys who showed interest in me a chance and I did not like leading them on (although they were very nice). And I am not afraid of sex, and I wouldn't describe those guys as perfect.


Honestly, hair/eye color,etc preference. I don't believe the media has influenced who I find attractive, because often times I disagree - I do not find most actors or models attractive. I am not afraid of relationships. It's pretty frustrating.

""Family issues"" background context: I suspect I put so much weight on romantic and friend-relationships because I can no longer rely on my family for unconditional love and support. We have some drama related to homophobia and cultural expectations of success and responsibility and what a good daughter should be. I've signed legally binding, and that's about all I have to say about my family. I do not want to go home (alas I must) and am dreading living at home this summer with a family that only loves and accepts me under certain conditions that require me to pretend to be someone I am not, both in terms of orientation and life goals/dreams.

Back when I was in a LDR, out-of-school me - near the end I sort of had a gut feeling that I was losing myself in the relationship [like this other redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tcgy8/ive_completely_lost_myself_in_my_relationship/). I wanted to be shown a lot of affection but - here's the thing: I was! Shortly before we broke up I went through logs of messages we'd exchanged and they were affectionate, reassuring and loving and you could tell that my ex was really trying hard to make me feel better in response to me saying that I felt unloved, I felt like a bad girlfriend etc. 

But all that just bounced, but I didn't believe them. I'd print out nice messages and cute drawings with hearts from my ex, and paste them in my diary, and reread them often. But I just couldn't believe that I was being loved and cherished, and I don't know why. This still happens now. We talk as friends now, but I get really insecure that they  (used as gender neutral singular) don't care about me, that I'm just a disposable friend who'll be set aside, out of mind situation. I follow their blog daily

I have been planning to talk to them about this for several months now

Now, at various points, usually when I express inscurity but once of their own volition. They tell me that they think I'm a great and interesting person, and that they appreciate me being their friend and that they're sorry if it doesn't always seem that way. Most recently yesterday, when in a bout of sleepiness I apologized for always being boring and just talking about inane things, there was a ""You're not boring."" - but these just bounce off; it doesn't even feel like I've heard them; they don't touch anywhere deeper than somewhere around my ribcage. Loving words do not touch my heart. 

Fast forward about a year to now, having friends has become a lot more important to me. I don't have many. There's only one girl here whom I really feel close and connected to, and then there are people who are a bit more distant than that, but still people I consider friends. But yeah - the same thing as with my ex is starting to happen. People here are busy, and no one initiates things with me unless they're paid to do so and to keep tabs on me (my RA asks me out to ice cream or lunch a few times a semester, for instance). I think that's the main way in which I feel loved, but I also understand that I can't just sit around and expect people to initiate things.

Again, and it still feels like the people I care a lot and want to be closer to about just don't care about me.

I have been working on the neediness seriously for about five months (before that I kept trying too, but I'm constantly trying to remind myself that it's ok, that it doesn't mean that other people aren't interested in me. When I notice myself being upset, I try to identify the cognitive distortion and supply an interpretation that doesn't involve me being unwanted, or when I can't come up with that, I just try to tell myself that everyone needs space to be with their other friends too.

But that's still ignoring the root of the problem: I am so needy - and then why can't I accept it when people make attempts to satisfy that need? Why can't believe that people like me? Why do I need this sort of constant reassurance, but what can I do about it?

I saw a school counsellor/therapist for about five sessions for crying all the time (related to feeling unloved), when feelings do hit strongly (e.g. when I feel unloved - although I KNOW rationally that it's not the case) I don't know how to deal with them and end up crying and crippled/unable to do anything and *I don't know why I'm crying*. It's just static in my head.

On the advice of my therapist, but then what do I do with those feelings of being unwanted?

I feel like I've taken one small step on the road to becoming more emotionally mature

TL;DR'd questions:

1.  I am so needy - and then why can't I accept it when people make attempts to satisfy that need? What can I do to improve this?

2. I often feel like I am lying to myself and grasping at straws when I tell reassure myself with the 'evidence' that people like me. Why don't people want to spend time with me and have fun with me? Maybe why is not important

3. I am working on being more in touch with my emotions,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,t3_1dadqb

I was in a relationship with a girl who I had known since I was in 6th grade about 2 months ago. She was recently separated from her husband and a divorce was pending. Her and I hadn't spoken much the entire time she was with her ex, having sex just about every day. It was easy for me to fall for her I guess

Anyway, mind you) that we would see each other for sexual needs only, etc. that lasted roughly two weeks. Wednesday of last week she came over and I had to work that night, I work overnight, but my roommates were off and they were going out to a local bar and she came with. 

Literally the next day, and she got her shit and left. Not going to lie, I spent the whole day fairly depressed, working on getting over things and trying to move on.

She called me later that night

She came over the next day

She comes over and brings her kid(who I adore, so when she got back I pretty much went to sleep. 

I woke up, were talking on the couch. It was an awkward vibe like maybe I was interrupting something. I went back in and took a shower, and after I left they were both outside the apartment taking. Again, there was this awkward vibe and tension and I left to go to work.

I text her when I'm at work to tell her how I felt awkward and asked if there was anything going on with her and Steve. She didn't respond. So the whole night I'm feeling anxious and paranoid. I left work early and came home. Her car was still in the parking lot(3am) and I rushed up Stairs to find her naked in his bed. 

As you can imagine

Eventually I found out that when my roommates and her went out last week, encouraged her to break things off with me completely and sleep with Steve. For what reasons I can only assume is because he is a giant gaping asshole. 

It should be noted

So my situation is I live with two awful human beings. One of which works with me. I have to see these people all the time. I don't have the means to really move right now. But I don't know what to do.

I feel like I'm going crazy. And I'm incredibly angry all the time. I don't know what to do about work

Hi. I'm a 22F who is experiencing heartbreak due to another self-sabotaged relationship. It was going so well - he [27M] treated me so well

I have casually dated many guys since I was 18

The last two times I've done this, along with theirs. And I can't seem to learn from it, which makes me wonder if I'm insane. I'm going to see a counselor about this, but I could really use some objective (and harsh) advice from you as well, because you people seem to offer pragmatic, objective, and often insightful advice.
My pattern is rather uncanny because it has happened in the same timeline 3 times: meet the guy in the spring/summer, and the guy I so desperately want to fix things with is just trying to get away from me.

I meet a guy who sparks interest in me

Around month 5 or 6 into the relationship, in spite of myself...
Then, come spilling out due to a trigger. Sometimes the trigger is stress, or sometimes I feel completely annoyed by a minor thing the guy says. Sometimes it's an article I read, or something my brother says. Like ""That girl is too awesome to be caught up with a boyfriend."" In my mind: ""Am I not awesome? What am I doing wrong? What is wrong with me? THIS is why I've never reached my potential.. The only answer is to break up with so-and-so. Then maybe I can become awesome?""

I have never referred to any of these guys as ""boyfriend."" It makes me uncomfortable to have us ""In a relationship"" on facebook, shallow, or flakey. and 2) because having a boyfriend is just distracting from focusing on me, and thus it is something 'bad'.
Family background: my mother has always been controlling, when I was home for the summers working, she would take my laptop and phone in order to force me to cut contact with the particular guy I was seeing. She would tell me I should focus on myself, that these guys were wrong for me (either they were ugly, or weird, or something else - there was always something bad about them), and scream at me if she found me talking to them. I eventually began to hate myself for dating a guy. Yet I kept doing it... and kept hating myself while I did it.

(Note: I'm not trying to blame my mom for my problems. I'm just throwing this in here so you can get a bigger picture of who I am. Ever since I was probably 10, many crushes growing up yet have never had a real serious relationship because I always break things off. And then start casually dating someone else. I had my first real ""love"" when I was 17. It was the same pattern - he was into me, I was disinterested, by November I'd detached myself. By late December/ January, I desperately wanted to be with him again. We got together but eventually he kept breaking up with me, on-and-off, and I was in love with him for 3+ years after that... Ever since

When I was 18 and a freshman in college, goofy-looking musician I'd met in my science lecture. I kept talking to him for the first few weeks of summer after I was back at home, working. My parents knew about him and tried to force me to stop skyping him or talking to him. This guy wasn't exactly the most handsome guy, but he was incredibly sweet and very talented, and we got along and liked each other. At one point my dad told me, ""You better not ever end up marrying an ugly fuck like [musician] and making fucking ugly babies."" I eventually detached myself from him and felt myself moving on.

From when I was 14, gchat, facebook, everything - so she knew about who I was seeing and how I felt about them. She's seen most or all of my private conversations with friends and guys I've been seeing. I have only been able to begin disengaging myself from her emotional and psychological influence since I graduated college and have become financially independent.

My mother was also very demanding in other aspects of my life. I was never working enough or doing well enough. I had a total 17 different jobs throughout college but she was never satisfied. I worked in restaurants, had many internships, and usually worked 2 jobs at a time while being in school. Over the summers I typically worked 3 jobs (2 paying jobs + an unpaid internship). I worked many, many, many double shifts. It was never enough.

I could never be good enough, plenty of solid internships on my resume, good portfolios, and 2 full-time job offers, and am now financially independent, I still felt (and feel) far behind. That I never fully pursued my talents to their potential. That I could have done more with what I was given, had I not wasted my time on petty things like boys or Facebook

So these things come up and haunt me in any relationship I enter. During my senior year of college (last year), yet I let myself date this guy with the same doubts and insecurities beginning to pop up more and more): I wasn't doing enough to focus on me. I didn't have time for a boyfriend, what was I doing. He was making me feel insecure and jealous, and I didn't like that. I wanted to be single for my senior year of college because I was in a transitional period and I saw no reason to be attached or in a relationship. We might move to different cities in 6 months and what would happen then? Why should we be so serious?

By November, and impending graduation took itself out in my usual pattern. I told him I didn't want a relationship. I was careless. He was heart-broken.

A month and a half later, and we'll see what happens in May."" He agreed but unfortunately by then he'd mentally disconnected from me. How could he trust me again? How would he know if I'd just leave him again at the turn of a hat? Things were never the same. He ended up slowly detaching himself from me in the next 2 months. He cheated on me for a month, lied, and then we went through a messy break-up. I was rock-bottom, and blaming myself for it all...

Then bring in 27M. I met him during my time of heartbreak. I was graduating in a month then moving to Europe to work for the summer, I was just graduating; I had things to figure out; I was moving to Europe and possibly not coming back; I wasn't ready for a relationship... We just hung out and hooked up a few times. Then I left for the summer.

We kept in contact. He was naturally a very committed guy and he wanted something more, thinking of my career, and making new friends. But I still thought of him, never hooked up with another guy because I didn't want to jeopardize the potential I had with 27M, and knew I had to make a decision. Either I enter a period of independence after my heartbreak and focus on me; or I give it a shot with 27M because he was just such a gem. I chose to give it a shot with him. I told myself I wouldn't repeat my pattern of self-sabotage. That I would open up to him and trust him. That I wouldn't break things off when I felt that stress or my self-hatred/ self-doubt creep in again. That everything would be okay.

I returned to the States in the fall, and things were flowing wonderfully. I was happy and so was he. He reduced my level of stress. We cooked together, treated one another with respect and care, and talked through any misunderstandings and conflicts. We were compatible.

When my fears that I wasn't doing well enough began sinking in again... I told myself that 27M didn't hold me back from pursuing my dreams. I shouldn't worry about that... When I spoke of pursuing an international career, smart, and hard-working... albeit a homebody and a committed 'relationship guy.'

I was so stupid to throw it away.

But the fears and the doubts kept creeping back in. I began to feel like I was in a box: I didn't have as much freedom as I would if I were single... I couldn't just leave the city and travel the world without putting him into the equation. I was young

On top of that: Why did I keep jumping from relationship to relationship? I hadn't been single in more than a year, single and lighthearted, who weren't emotionally-exhausted or tied down like I was? Who were free to do what they pleased, without worrying about a boyfriend?

So then, and a weekend restaurant job). I said it: ""I see myself being single at some point in my 20's as I travel again... I'd like to focus on myself and figure things out.""

27M freaked out... he was of course hurt and upset. I e-mailed him a few days later hoping to clarify and reconcile things. ""I don't want to break up

A week later he broke up with me because he ""couldn't be in a relationship that he knows will end."" But we saw each other several more times in December, while learning how to make him feel more secure and not place an expiration date on the relationship. I wanted to tell him that he never limited me from pursuing my dreams, that it was an automatic pattern for me to say ""I want independence over a boyfriend,"" but I'd never truly thought it through. That I didn't want to repeat that pattern.

It was too late and by the time I'd finally had time to sort through what I wanted

There it was, sabotage my own happiness? Why couldn't I learn to take care of the things that deep down, I truly did cherish in spite of everything... I blew it, and broke both of our hearts.

Why do I do this and why do I never learn? What can I do to stop this? Please help.

TL;DR: I have a horrible and exhausting pattern of dating many guys, or because of my own self-doubt and self-hatred; then I want them back when it's too late.

She says she’s happy with me, but seems bored with sex and uses a vibrator almost every time I leave the house.",Throw_Away0001,14,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/16deuu/my_30m_sex_life_with_my_girlfriend_28f_of_16/

My girlfriend and I have been having issues (sex related and not) for a while now. As you’ve probably guessed, and had wonderful conversations. She’s beautiful. Honestly, she seemed perfect.

I knew since we started dating that she had some issues she was working through with a therapist, I respected her a lot for getting help, working through it, and being honest with me. I tried not to underestimate how those issues might affect her, and their potential for causing problems between us, and I was willing to truly accept them as part of her and her struggle.

In Jan. of last year, understand where the arguments and lack of sex were coming from. I won’t say that I handled it perfectly, but I did the best I knew how. She (and her therapist) even thought I was dealing with it well.

Not long after this (early Feb.), and I tried to push her to open it (honestly, I’ve been that way since I was a kid; a box can’t arrive at the house without me needing to open it. I get excited). She finally gave in, saying something like, “Oh, I know what this is, I ordered it for us, and it was clear it was something she ordered for herself and didn't want me to know about. I felt weird about it

Over the next few months, and let her know that, if she’s unhappy with us or our sex life, I’m willing to talk and try new things. She’s always attributed our problems to other things, and still says she’s completely happy with me, in and out of bed. At one point she even said that her sex drive just isn't that high, contradicting what she’d said before.

We started living together in June.

A few months later (Sept.) it came out that she had lied to me about a few things. Things that seemed potentially big, and those things actually ended up being small, and mostly to do with things she's self conscious about (dropping a class, missing an appointment). She told me about the vibrator, and said she rarely used it. This was hard for me because she lied about it for so long. I also learned how much she’ll deny any lie, to the point of almost needing photographic evidence before she’ll come clean.

Fast forward to now, but it’s awkward. Ever since last Jan., sex has always seemed force, like it’s a chore for her, or worse, a favor for me. She tries to seem mostly interested, but there’s always a hesitation to it, the romance just seems gone for her. A lot of days go by without a kiss. I have tried to talk several times, but I know it happens more than she says. She says once a week-ish

I’d love any help I can get. I love her

**TL;DR:** A year ago, and hid ordering and using a vibrator from me a few weeks after. I’ve tried to work on our relationship and offer to do anything I could, and give her anything she needs. She says she loves me and she’s happy, but is distant from me (even during sex) and runs for the vibrator whenever I leave the house.",,False,,False,t3_16deuu

More than 8 years ago, do you want kids?  My answer is maybe to the first and definitely no to the second. I'm open to adoption, but I have severe moral dilemmas with bringing new life into this world.  She disagreed, so despite being madly in love we part ways. That sucked. 

I've kept in touch with her, she still loves me, I still love her, same issue still stands. She shared with me how tough it had been dating knowing that she had to eventually inform some poor schmuck that she was still in love with me, but she'd been figuring that out and navigating. The same way I had. It sucks. 

I met my most recent girlfriend shortly after that. We fall in love, for me is a formality of an already intact arrangement - not off the table, but doesn't carry the same weight with it as it does for some.  For me that commitment comes earlier. 

We celebrated our one year anniversary on Oct. 15. She turned 29 soon after, and we broke up last week. Because she wants kids, and a wedding.

In talking this through with friends I keep hitting a brick wall. That it doesn't matter that we spent a year with the same expectations. She has an inviolate right to change her mind on a whim about these major life things, agree with that. I mean, you can't be a controlling jerk about these things, but seriously? WTF? Look at it from my perspective. I got burned this way once. I communicated it clearly from early on, re-affirmed it many times, and suddenly BAM! Same thing. 

Now, just haven't gotten as serious with others. You obviously can't guarantee people won't change their minds, and I know I'll find someone eventually. But in the meantime, do I really need to keep burning more than a year at a pop just to, I don't know?, help someone through a process of self discovery just to wind up getting dumped? Is there a way I could be going about this better?

Why is adoption anathema to some people unless there is no other option?

Is there any way to make this process easier? I little safer for me? 

And, that I'm in the wrong? My friends who, dammit, should be supporting *me*, are largely taking up her case and trying to convince me to change my mind about kids. What's up with that?

I was 13, but much to my surprise, I got a callback anyways. So, there I was, sitting in the middle school auditorium... alone, awaiting my turn to sing 12 bars of a highly edited kidified version of Luck Be A Lady from Guys and Dolls, when suddenly, I'd never had a fruitful conversation with a cute girl before. Not one. We soon became great friends, these crushes would come and go


Come senior year of high school, because we were in a show together with a very small cast, which was much more intimate than the huge musicals that we did in the spring. We eventually ended up hooking up (for the first time in our 5 year friendship, mind you), and started talking about a relationship. After we finally got into it, I was absolutely ecstatic. This was a girl who I had loved for 5 years, who I would jump out of bed to go to school for, but I should probably get into the 'death' thing that I mentioned in my sensational title.


When I was 14, which is a rapid and sometimes irregular heartbeat originating in the ventricles of the heart. The heart attacks degraded the muscle tissue in my ventricles leading to the disease.
The events come practically every day. I'll be sitting, or whatever, then suddenly my heart will pound out of my chest. The palpitations are often so intense that they can be clearly seen through my shirt.
My cardiologist said that my case was one of the worst he's ever seen, each time one of these events happen, my condition worsens.
My cardiologist said this past summer that the odds of me having another heart attack within the next year is ""near 100%"". He also began to delicately tell my parents and I that heart failure is practically almost guaranteed, which will lead to improvement of my symptoms; however, it is not the end all, and will probably just end up delaying the inevitable.


**PART II**


I made out with another girl in May, which I was going to come back from, and be home for 3 days before going off to college. I fought for her, because she is the love of my life. It took a few months of ups and downs, and me trying to earn her trust back before, finally, this past weekend on her birthday, and bought 5 presents that were wholly inside jokes about our relationship, the next few days she was being horribly distant. I called her, and told me that she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted nothing to do with me. I didn't think it was serious


I go home for break Thursday. I was going to sit her down and tell her about my probably deadly condition. Should I still do this? I don't want it to seem like I want her to pity me... But hearing the odds of my heart failure within the next 5-10 years really made me look at my life, as morbid as this next statement may be, I want to spend as much time with her as possible before I go.

From October 2006 to November 2008 I was in a relationship with a girl whom I loved dearly, I just felt so calm and at peace around her, I'm a very intense passionate guy and being with her was like a calm washed over me and I felt 'at peace'.

I didn't used to be 'good with girls', the girls weren't making me happy, they weren't helping me get over her, they were illustrating to me perfectly that she was someone truly special.

When me and A first split up we spent a few months apart, got in to the best shape I've ever been in, and I thought I'd won her back, but she came back to tell me that she wasnt attracted to me any more and that she was thinking of seeing someone else - this transpires to be her best friend at Uni...

I'm 21, I'm not going to say what it was, just for the fact that it was basically nothing at all, and would probably cause an entirely different discussion in itself. But please believe me when I say it was nothing personal, nothing traumatic, and  nothing with the slightest bit of importance at all. I doubt anyone else would have given it a second though, if they even thought about it at all) And when it happened, it's like the ""me"" center of my brain has just shut down completely. It wasn't a slow downward spiral that lasted a few days

Once that happened, my ambitions, and most importantly, all of my emotions. Everything that made me exactly who I was is now just... gone. There's no other way to describe it. I've tried my best almost everyday to somehow get it all back. Tried to force myself to *feel* this way, or to *want* to do this, or to *think* this way about something. But never has there ever been even the slightest sign of success. I had to stop trying so much after a while because after an hour or two, I got really bad headaches in the front of my head.

This is all terrible for many reasons. Since I don't find anything interesting, I was having a great time with it. Fast forward to the next day after this happened.  Nope. There's suddenly nothing fun about that game. It wasn't boring, and it didn't suck, but it sure as hell wasn't fun anymore. This same thing goes along with any interest I had in music, movies, tv shows, or almost any sort of activity at all. I always had the easiest time making myself feel immersed into something I really enjoyed watching, or playing, and to be honest the one thing that I consider a beacon of hope that things might get better for me, I'm not as into it as I was just a week or so ago. This song is seriously the closest I've felt to being myself again but it was only while I was listening to it. I know it's not much

Another thing is how I can't seem to think in the same way that I use to. In a way it's almost like I've lost my common sense too. And it's not that I don't want to, it's like I can't think of something I, or any other normal person, would say during certain conversations. I might be able to hold a good conversation for maybe about 30 seconds on average, but after that, it's like my brain refuses to think of anything to continue it after that time, and it becomes just a dead conversation after that.

The most terrible about this though is that I haven't felt one single emotion that felt like a ""pure"" emotion if that makes any sense. An emotion that just *happens* and gives off a sense of what makes you you. Not happiness, hatred, joy, excitement, anticipation, loneliness, or even love. I may have felt some of these emotions in one way or another, and only felt it a little (which means it's fake and shouldn't even count really), or anything

And the worst part about having no emotion is I feel absolutely *no* connection with anyone at all about anything. My mom has a pretty tough time at work 90% of the time, but then there are those times where I know something she went through is bad, I know I should feel some sort of compassion for her, I know I should be either sad, or mad with her. But I don't. I just don't. No matter how badly I want to, no matter how badly I try, it's never there. And because of that, because how can I possibly have any idea when I feel nothing at all? Back before all this happened

It's not just compassion either. It's literally any type of connection. Hanging out with friends has become a huge challenge now. When you hang out with someone, even if it was something I never found particularly interesting to begin with. Half the time it was just *being* with someone else that made the day great. But now? Nope. None of that. Some of us we'll be telling stories of something that happened recently, and I can't find it to be funny, happy, sad, or whatever it's suppose to be. And because nothing seems memorable to me anymore, I usually never have any stories for anyone anymore. The few times I have had something to tell, then you basically have a really boring person to hang out with. Part of me thinks I may lose friends sometime over this.

The part that scares me the most about this is I'm afraid I won't be able to fall in love with anyone anymore. One of the main things, and to feel wanted and needed back. I was in love once and it was the most incredible experience I've had in my whole life. And I just couldn't wait for it to happen again. But if this keeps going on, it most certainly won't *ever* happen again. I may have just ruined a chance like that with someone just a few days ago. It's a long story that I won't talk about here, but I can't help but feel it was my fault things ended up the way they did, and I'm having a hard time ever seeing even a friendship happening between us now too. And I can't help but blame a lot of it on this.

This all ended up being much longer than I expected and I'm sorry if it's too long. The only thing I'm asking for is what is this? Have any of you experienced this, if anything at all? The one thing I think of when reading all this is depression, but there's one reason I don't think it's that: I don't feel sadness. I went through a pretty bad depression for a few years that I was able to get myself out of, and I know what that feels like. And at least then I still felt other emotions too. But with this the only thing I feel is apathy. A very pessimistic apathy. So unless there's a type of depression where you don't feel anything at all, I really don't think it's that.

Any type of information you can give me will be more than appreciated. I'm feeling desperate at this point to just feel like a real person again. If you feel like there's more you need to know to help,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,t3_p91cs

I have always been a bit antisocial, I always thought that my ""future husband"" would show up somehow naturally in the right time.

So I carried on with my life, but this is not the life I sincerely thought I would live.

A few years ago I realized that my dream life was not happening and that I was growing old, in order to foster a relationship, but I was very unsuccessful. I felt like I was an expired product in a meat market and I felt so worthless because none of the guys I liked would reciprocate.

Just to clarify, academics, etc, and even then I was not able to sustain a meaningful relationship.

Some guys showed interest in me, so that I would not be alone, but I just felt very unhappy, so I let them go.

I know I should be more proactive

What worries me beside than dying alone

I resent that if I were cunning I would have a husband by now

I am not perfect, and I even posted on r/amiugly and most people said that I was pretty.

I am very aware they are not okay and I haven't voiced them to anybody but I'm just looking for some help/advice.

The girl and I have been friends for very long (6 years) and have been walking the line between friendship and more than that for just as long. Only two months ago have we decided to start dating officially (BF/GF).

The problem here is

She recently traveled far away (tropical Asia) for a long time with her girlfriends.  I know deep down inside that she would do nothing to hurt me. I am positive of that because I've known her for so long and have seen what she's like in relationships. That's not what I'm worried about. For some reason, I'm just jealous that she's having fun while I'm cooped up at home with nothing to do except work and go to the gym and occasionally hang out with friends. What I do pales in comparison with what she's doing right now and I can't stand it.

I know this type of jealousy isn't okay, I get so jealous and resentful that it gives me a headache and a tight chest. 

I have never expressed any of this jealousy though. This is the first time she's traveling long distance and long term away from me (even during our friendship)

Help :( I really need help :( I know it's wrong to feel like this. You should be happy that your SO is happy. And I am. But I shouldn't feel jealous and resentful also.

That might be okay if you're half my age, or even a relationship? Obviously I'm going to completely suck at these things due to inexperience. I'm afraid she'll just take a bad kiss/sex as a sign that there is no chemistry and bolt. Or maybe if she knew the cause, she would take it as a massive red flag: ""What's more likely? That I'm wrong about being attracted to him, or literally every other woman he has ever met? There must be something wrong with him...""

And that's just one problem. I feel uncomfortable around people I don't know, but secretly hoping for more is a terrible basis for a friendship and will lead to catastrophe when the inevitable rejection comes.

- Am very introverted in general ;
- Am extremely vulnerable to being made fun of.

Last year I met, who lived in Durand, Michigan. She was a lively, quirky artist girl who was very compassionate, had many friends that she always supported, was adorable in every way, and was very geeky. 

We got along immediately, who would see value in me like nobody else ever had, who was funny and interesting and cheerful, who liked me honestly, and all that. 

I think I had managed to be in a fair friendship where nobody was overbearing

Then she started popping up much less often. Then she stopped popping up entirely on Skype, and all sorts of things, said reassuring words to me, and all seemed well. Then I confessed. Then I would often send messages, that weren't obsessional yet...And she wouldn't answer. Then I started sending a lot more. Still no answer. Then, I guess I went crazy from missing the person most precious to me ever. So I sent hundreds of messages that run along the whole spectrum of human emotions, with fury, normalcy

After 700+ messages, or one order to stop. Just nothing. That's what had driven me mad in the first place. 

I guess I were wrong. But I think

I guess I've missed a lot of details

The thing is that I'm a girl that's always around members of the opposite sex. Pretty much all my friends are male, but I rarely ever feel the same way about them.

So what's the deal? I always feel like every guy I get close to has to like me romantically. I tell myself that they do, I feel like I've won or earned something. I'm not heartless or anything, I do also like them as people, but just not romantically. That's why I feel like I'm being a real b*tch for actually wanting them to have feelings for me.

For example, but I feel jealous/pissed off when I see him talk to other girls or hear other people talk about girls he might like.

**Ages 1-10**
 I was very hyperactive/impulsive which made finding friends who could tolerate me very difficult . I had made close friends here and there
I was not medicated until middle school which caused my ability to make friends, and I felt bullied by not only my classmates, but my teachers as well.

I was in the scouts which I hated since isn't exactly geared towards individuality. My achievements were dismissed

My mother was a single parent who struggled with depression

**Age 6 or7**

**Age 8ish**
 While I was in a different boyscout troop

**Age 9 or 10**
 Anger issues/oppositional defiance - Everyone and every experience really broke me. No one really understood me, I had major trust issues; therapy went nowhere constructive.

**Ages 9 - 12**
My mother started dating my school counselor. I feel like it was messed up that he and my mother even dated, we moved in together, and shouting matches were frequent between everyone. My stepfather force fed me his paxil during this period.

**Ages 9 - 15**
Parents fought relationship was complete shit. The disregard he had for us was mind-boggling. He saw us as objects (and often as obstacles), chain smoking, neglectful dick with anger issues. He hit me once during a roadtrip to see his trashy family in Amarillo, and I hit back. He took me to the sheriff of Bumfuck, Texas who preceded to tell me I had no right to hit back, and that he beats his own son whenever he is 'out of line'.

My mother slept often because she was constantly depressed and unhappy. My stepfather was a selfish bully. I took care of my sister because they obviously could not.

**Ages 11 - 13**
 Life fucking sucked because puberty, and the lack of stability in my life. I constantly planned to runaway, fantasized about destroying my stepfathers car and house, wished that my stepfather would die, believed I must have been adopted by my mother, had no one I felt I could talk to about my life, and was unable to really put into words what I was going through. I turned into a depressed

Had friends from church that weren't really interested in being friends.

**Age 14**
 My grandfather died in hospice. I regretted that I had not been able to talk to him more or express how much I appreciated him. I had totally irrational thoughts that it was my fault that he died/if I would have been better he would still be around. The guy died of ALS which is a degenerative disease; it was painful to see such a proud man die a slow and dignified death.

**Age 16 - 17**
 Became a foreign exchange student and predictably floundered due to immaturity, lack of communication, social failings, social anxieties, lack of money to support myself (my parents were supposed to send me money each month), and eventual decline into depression. I had friends that I spent a ton of time with. I think a lot of my idiosyncrasies were written off as being from a different culture. I became an alcoholic to cope with the stress. It was shitty, so I stopped using it as a form of escapism once I came back to the states. Oh towards the end of my foreign exchange I learned that my parents were getting a divorce

**Age 17**
 My mother struggled to get by

**Age 17-19**
 This time period is a blur. I have done sex work, I dated a few people who were terrible influences, got dragged into a lot of drama, and I struggled to get by. I dropped out of college because I felt a massive amount of anxiety around other people.

I pretty much got dragged along with crazy friends while they followed their schemes

Cut and abused myself. Frequently tried to overdose on pills. Have never received proper treatment from a single hospital or psycheward no matter how much I pleaded for therapy. Anti-psychotics gave me shakes, trazadone, wellbutrin, celexa) had been ineffective; one caused muscle spasms and giddiness . I was prescribed xanax, however, I don't think it was appropriate for long term use.

**Age 18**
Jokingly offered a homeless meth addict $100 to jump off the Santa Monica pier. I originally offered him $50, stripped, climbed over the wooden fencing, and before letting go said, ""I am prone to hypothermia, keep an eye on my stuff."" My friends and I ran before he hit the water.
I feel disgusted with myself

**Age 19**
Was feeling lonely, felt horribly alone, and a social outcast while at an informal camp of hundreds of travelers.

**Age 19-20** 
Currently isolating myself from the world because I am scared of socializing with people. I have no idea how to be comfortable in social situations unless I am in a comfortable environment with people I trust.

It's incredibly hard to fake being anything but a neurotic mess. I'm deadpan, and constantly looking around even if I need to focus. Getting a job seems impossible since everything is customer service oriented and requires cheerful, energetic, extroverts.
I have a shell that is impossible to break out of unless I have spent a considerable amount of time with someone.

I believe the issues I have with ANXIETY and DEPRESSION developed as byproducts of my ADHD. These issues exasperate symptoms of my ADHD
 
**TL;DR**

 I am lonely and want to be around people, if I am making an effort in an uncomfortable situation I feel horribly anxious.


 I am obviously inferior and I am ashamed. I can't be who I want to become because I am unable to string a coherent original thought together that anyone would want to hear. I have somehow muzzled myself


 I know that being unable to work on something that I don't find absolutely fascinating for more than 5 minutes is not a normal mode of operation. I multitask (ineffectively) ruthlessly while not taking any ADHD meds.


 I was a hyperactive child and was diagnosed with ADHD w/ hyperactivity 


 I dwell on failed social interactions

Anyway, so it's the whole dad connection thing. 

With the most recent guy, it's what drew me in, because I wanted to be the girl who changed him. And I feel worthless because I wasn't that girl. What I really hate. There are no words to describe how useless I feel because he didn't want me. And now I think he has some girlfriend (?) and I feel like he won't cheat on her. And why wasn't I the girl who got through to him. Why wasn't I enough, you know. I'm never enough. And it feels awful. And I said that to the therapists: I just want to know that it wasn't me. I want to know that no one could change him, that it's his problem and not mine. And they can't tell me that, because sometimes love does change people. Just not mine. 

Because I'm doing all that stuff someone is supposed to do. I have a great job. How many 23 year olds can say they make 30 bucks an hour

And I've tried so hard with this therapy and all that. I just want to know that I'm fighting for something and I'll win. Eventually. Some how. Because right now it all just feels awful.

I've heard form people that people tend to find me weird, i talk a lot, but i dont mean to annoy, i just enjoy conversing.

I've never had a girlfriend either

THat was a pretty emotional blow to me, someone to just be there. a friend. anything.

As this year progressed, who rented two houses to stay in. they went around and asked for payments, and who they would be staying with and they just skipped me, didn't even consider me to be a possibility. even my only proper guy friend is going. he hardly even hangs out with them.

We're still friends. i'm okay with that i guess, it wasn't awkward and she's still a closer friend than i've had in a long while. but it feels as if (from my perspective) she's just regressed into another friend that wont stick out of the crowd. there if i need them but ultimately i'm not on their priority list of people.

My only hope is that I can make some kind of sense so that perhaps someone out there can relate or at the very least offer some sort of guidance.  That and I hope my TL;DR is an accurate summation.

First, I think I finally have an idea.

But I won't bore you with those details.  My issue is this:  I don't think I can get over my ex girlfriend and I have no fucking idea why.

**The Backstory**

The infamous woman was my first serious girlfriend (let's call her Erin).  She moved in down the street from me back in the 7th Grade and, we did everything typical preteen guys would do, including terrorizing Erin and her friends.  Oddly enough, Erin and I developed an attraction to each other over those years and, after Mike moved away and we both conveniently found ourselves single, we started dating.  This was the end of freshman year.

High school went by pretty unremarkably

Now up until this point, we had one of those agreements where we dreamed of the day where we would both take each others innocence in some amazing session of love making (oh yea, we said we loved each other since 6 months into the relationship).  But with the looming transition to college where we would be a mere 2 hours apart from each other, unbeknownst to me, Erin started to freak out.

The night of graduation, coupled in with the alcohol I just drank for the first time, I was wasted.  On my trek home I stumble upon Erin having a sleepover with her best friend in a tent (totally legit, they've done it before), but with the addition of two dudes.  Whatever, I trust my woman.  I get my fucked up ass to bed and then I wake up 2 hours later to a crying Erin calling me saying she just made out with one of the bastards in the tent.

Now that's all she did was make out, but Reddit, damn did I bawl my eyes out at this.  After the 3 years of what felt like complete and utter love for each other, she did that shit.  And then, we ""took a break"" where she would basically go out and hang out with this guy or whatever and then call me when she got home.  ""You're the guy I come home to,"" she said.  I went along with it for a month because I had invested so much emotionally in her even to the extent of alienating my friends, so I really didn't have a choice.  Eventually, I got sick of it and basically told her to burn in hell.  She cried

Then we had sex and took each other's virginities.  And then we fucked again.  A lot.  Then I went off to training camp and she came and visited me.  And we had more sex.

Then the tables turned and I cheated on her.  It was orientation weekend and Erin was being what I perceived as bitchy in my drunken state

We then dated tumultuously until the end of sophomore year

And then

**The Problem Emerges**

The upcoming junior year and subsequent senior year were ones wrought with an early 21st birthday and lots of drunken hookups.  The problem?  I couldn't fucking get hard for any of them.

I tried being sober.  I tried taking pills.  Hell I tried doing the anti-solution and ripping shots of whiskey.  But to no avail.  I couldn't stay hard long enough to have any sort of meaningful intercourse.  And from what I can recall

On the bright side

But the problem goes beyond sexual dysfunction.  I couldn't let anyone get close.  There are three chances that stick out in my mind as completely blown opportunities where I'm 99.7% sure I would have been incredibly happy with any of those women.  But, even to the extent I turned down what amounted to free sex.

I couldn't get Erin out of my mind.  I only wanted to fuck Erin.  When I masturbated

**How this is still fucking me**

I'm currently in a relationship that is going on 6 months.  My girlfriend is absolutely brilliant and she makes a conscious effort every day to be the best girlfriend she can be.  I'm truly the luckiest guy around.

The issue?  I still feel closed off.  I mean damn it the girl I'm dating now is better IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY

Is it because Erin took my V-Card years ago?  Or is there something else going on here?  What's fucked up is I know I would not be happy with Erin

The best way I can think to describe how I'm feeling is to liken it to being a small child on a crowded sidewalk in NYC during rush hour. People are pushing and shoving me out of their way

That's how my world feels sometimes. As I've grown up I've come to realize how scary and hostile the world can be. I'm all alone in an existential sense. I don't have a support group. Every relationship/friendship I've clung to in the past has eventually turned into sand

I feel that everywhere I go people are telling me that I'm wrong, but I'm thin skinned and don't take criticism well. I wish I could give no fucks and ignore what people say, but I can't. Everything is personal.

I wish I could assert myself more. If I could do that

But I can't do that because of my crushing self-confidence issues. (The inability to assert myself and my self-confidence are related and feed into each other like a vicious cycle.) 

I feel like if only I were really good at something, unloveable, and not worth the space.

I recently went in for a job interview. It's a technical type job

I wish I could become a more solid person

**tl;dr**: I feel like everywhere I go people are taking issue with who I am/what I'm doing/what I believe. I have no self confidence and thus can't assert myself.

I am a 24 year old female

Throughout school I was unpopular, but due to the issues I'd had at school I wasn't even really aware of how a friendship was supposed to work let alone a relationship so it didn't set off alarm bells when he wouldn't let me go out without him. Jim was fairly awful to me, though he told me over and over again that he loved me. When I was 17 we had sex, I didn't want to but he just told me over and over again ""It's okay, I love you, you love me too, right?"" And I wasn't strong enough emotionally or physically to stop him. I didn't even think of it as rape although looking back now it probably was. I'd like to say I left Jim not long after that

When I arrived in the city I was going to be studying in suddenly all the things that had made me a freak in school were desirable to people. My hobbies, I thought I loved him, I let him sleep with me because I was pretty sure that was what love -was- thanks to Jim. I'm apparently amazing at attracting the worst types because before long Leo was putting all kinds of pressure on me. Deciding who I could be friends with, moving in with me, making me feel like an utter shit if I ever wasn't 'in the mood.' I never told Leo about Jim, I did try to tell him I was unhappy but he more or less didn't care. Fast forward to three years ago, I was rushed into hospital with severe abdominal pain. I was in intensive care for several days and had two sets of reasonably major surgery. I was sent home three weeks later hopped up on narcotics and had to go back in for more minor surgeries as an outpatient for the next month. Leo didn't visit me very much whilst I was in hospital, but I was basically too high on painkillers to really know what I was doing. 

You can probably see where this is going, we argued a lot but in the end decided to try and work it out for the kid. Bad idea I know but it seemed like the best option at the time. After a great many ups and downs we seperated for good when the kid was less than a year old. I've been much happier since then but I find in increasingly hard to trust anyone at all, not friends, family and definitely not men. I don't want to bring my child up that way, especially with the various other 'side-effects' of my life to date including an absolute and total inability to talk about anything related to intimacy. I figure I've got a few years to get over that before I end up scarring the kid for life but I don't even know where to start as far as fixing it goes.

I’ve only been on a couple of dates since then and they were with the same guy. Nothing worth writing about happened between us. So I’m in a bit of a dry spell when it comes to dating for awhile now.

The only problem I have with this is that I’m jealous of all my friends’ relationships. Almost all of my close female friends are in relationships. My roommate

I’m really happy for all of them. Their guys treat them right and are generally good people and we all get along well. They are all amazing friends and I couldn’t be happier for them.

I just can’t stop these feelings of jealousy though. A couple of weeks ago my roommates’ boyfriend surprised her by taking her and a couple of friends to Cedar Point (a big roller coaster park) for her birthday. While I went and I had an amazing time I couldn’t help but feel jealous. I’ve never dated a guy that treated me as well as he treats her and I would over joyed if a boyfriend of mine was even around on my birthday

I have another friend whose’ boyfriend is alway buys her the best gifts for birthdays

And I’m sick of 75% of my facebook newsfeed being about some ones boyfriend. It’s annoying. You love your boyfriend and he loves you. Cool. I don’t need to read about it every night.

What bothers me most though is that every time I’m in a group social situation I’m usually the only single person there. It’s really starting to bother me more lately and I’ve been avoiding those types of situations which means that I’m usually home alone instead of out with my friends. I’ve hinted several times about “OMG girls night! We should do that! So much fun!” but it’s yet to happen.

Quick background: I'm a 19 y/o college student. I've never been in a real relationship; never even had my first kiss yet. I would definitely say I'm weird, and I've been asked out multiple times.  

But I always turn guys down because idk

Now I know I appear super ultra innocent to everyone else on the outside (coz tiny and quiet and nerdy), and the more I do the more I'm realizing a vanilla sex life is probably not what I want o____o.  

But that's far down the line. Baby steps. Haven't even been kissed yet. So I don't know why this popped into my mind when one of my close guy friends made an advance on me (while both intoxicated a bit)

But then I get to thinking I'll never find a guy who would go along with some of the fantasies I have in my mind

So what do I do? Or
1) How do I stop running away from potential relationships? Am I being too picky? Should I at least give guys a chance before immediately turning it down? I sometimes feel like I have to say no (rather than 'lets give it a try') to avoid leading guys on since
2) What do I do to calm this libido? I used to be morally against one night stands, etc) to people I don't care about; but this is gradually losing its importance to me, especially when alcohol is involved (how I've managed to avoid losing my first kiss while intoxicated is beyond me). Regardless, societal pressure makes me feel like a loser being this old and having had done nothing.  
3) What do I do about my expectations for actual relationships? Drop them like it's hot? Realistically speaking it's not likely I'll find a guy who meets all my ideal critereon given the social circles I keep. But I don't want to 'settle' either? I don't know &gt;_&lt;.

Before I deleted him, I watched him become closer to his ex again on facebook. This made me feel terrible, as it seemed that he was going back to his ex (for attention, not for a relationship: she's been happily dating somebody else for months) because she was so amazing and I couldn't live up to the expectations she'd set for him.

My problem is this. Ever since meeting these people, but now I feel I should be doing something more worthwhile with my time.

You go into college with certain expectations.  Now, I was kind of an introvert.  People liked me well enough, and I got along with my classmates, but I hardly ever hung out with people outside of school.  I was hoping that things would change in college.

I was expecting drinking

I make a friend

The two girls both had boyfriends left over from highschool, and starts dating my friend.  'D' was my dream girl.  She was smarter than me, she was geekier than me, she was more adventurous and more experienced than me.  After that first night, the two of us pass out on her bed.  We didn't have sex, still clothed, and didn't even kiss.

I fell for her, but she knew.  There were more than a few occasions that I tried to replicate that first perfect night.

The thing is, nor would she tell me to fuck off.  I later learned from L that she just didn't want to hurt my feelings.  She never broke up with her boyfriend, who was at another college in the city.  He was studying the same thing as me, he looked a lot like me, and he even had the same name as me.

After our freshman year

I decided not to be 'that guy' and move back in with my parents after dropping out.  I got an apartment with the money I had saved from my HS job.  For nearly 6 months, I got along but didn't really see anyone outside of work.  After a few months a new girl started working there that I thought was pretty alright, but I didn't really have the courage to ask her out.

I eventually started up classes at another school, but haven't made any friends outside of classes.  as a night school student, there isn't really the social group thing going on that I missed out on the first go-round.

I started working at this other place, and about 6 months in I had pretty much moved in with her.  The thing was, I wasn't ready to get that serious yet.  I feel like I've missed out on all the fun stuff that never happened in college.  I've never dated casually, I've never hooked up with a friend randomly (I don't have any to do that with), I haven't really been out clubbing or to wild parties. She tried to help me with that, but she told me on multiple occasions that when she was wild at college (she was 25, I was 24) and out barhopping and getting drunk had hooking up with guys, she didn't help me to get.

Since breaking up with her, but I felt that the age gap made things awkward.  I got on well enough with people, and there was one girl that I hit it off with.  The problem is, once the project we were working on ended (I volunteered to build sets for a play), we haven't really talked.  I've messaged her a few times on FB and had conversations.

I've kind of reached the point where I'll try anything.  I even started a profile on a dating site.

**//TL:DR** If you skipped the rest of it

Every time I meet a girl I want to have a go at, that I have nothing to offer them, or that they already have something better going on.  I am constantly thinking that if they wanted to have a relationship with me, they would let me know (&lt;that was the most important sentence on this entire page). The thing is - they don't.

A lot of guys have a crush on me

I play all of the modern games, I love physics, maths, chemistry, biology and so on. I'm open-minded, understand a lot of people's problems, I can relate to them. I also have a weird sense of humor that people seem to love.

In real life most people don't care much for me. I don't have any friends in real life anymore. The only people interested in me are guys who are looking for a one time thing. I have a chronically sickness and can't go out


My problem is, I wasn't even slightly interested in them. I can't tell if this is because I feel like I am not good enough for anyone or if it is that I can tell they wouldn't be able to deal with me and how I am. There was one guy I loved a lot and still do, he doesn't talk to me anymore.

I've just started college and, or things like that - although I am a little shy, I've been trying very hard to work on that over the past few months and I've been able to strike up conversations with complete strangers in college really well in the 4 weeks since I started. I've gotten on quite well with a few people and have gone to lunch, society meetings, etc with them.

My problem is now, or clingy, or annoying, that they don't really want me around. I feel like this with my friends from home as well; although there are one or two that I feel confident around, with the rest I can never quite shake the feeling that they only like the other people in my group of friends, and just put up with me for the sake of being nice. I don't know if this is actually true, or if I'm just not confident enough in myself :/

I know I'm not good enough friends with the people from college I've been talking to to get worried about all this stuff yet, and my friends from home, I'm not just trying to to be friends with them for the sake of it). 

So... tl;dr: I get anxious about my friendships and I want to stop. How do I do this? And how do I let people know I want to get to know them better/hang out more/that I like them and want to be friends without coming across as pathetic or needy?

Some back story to help bring you up to speed in this complicated relationship. I am 24M and she is 23F. We met in high school and while we never ""officially dated"" we were incredibly close. She is the closest relationship I have had and I think I am the closet one she has had. 

She ""friend zoned"" me but I still loved her. I never told her how I truly felt. I told myself it was because I did not want to mess up what we had. Though really

We would do things like talk on the phone constantly

After a great year long relationship

Eventually we did reconnect towards the end of high school. We had lunch a couple of times and still remained friendly on a superficial level. After high school she went to college on the other side of the country and I stayed close to home. We would correspond through Facebook every couple of months but nothing more than ""hey how's school/life?"". Mainly she would be the one asking. 

Flash forward to a year ago or so ago. She reached out to me out of the blue and our relationship started going from simple superficial Facebook interactions, it has been great reconnecting with her.

I recently took a job about 8 hours from where she is going to school
 
Throughout the past seven year I have still loved her. She has always been on my mind and no matter what I would do or the women I saw

What do I do now? What should I say? Up until tonight I never even kissed her. I do want to tell her how I feel

and here it is cut and pasted...

&gt;Any tips? Specifically?

    .

I don't have a tv, my ""real-life"" experiences of rejection and feeling over-looked have contributed a lot, but comments on reddit, by a man I will never meet, who is probably a 500+ lb basement dweller who is as addicted to porn as WOW have left me in tears. Actually shaking with rage and despair. I KNOW it isn't healthy. I've read The Beauty Myth. I've done a lot of ""work"" with my therapist.

    .

I was raped when I was a teenager and during it, but MOST adult women today would kill for the body I had (I know I would to get it back!). I already had pretty low self esteem because being a teenager is rough, and not having the body type currently in fashion just compounds your feeling of worthlessness. Those words, at that time in my life, affected me A LOT more than the rape and violence. I've been in therapy. I worked it out. I understand what was going on there and for the most part, I ""got over that"".

    .

A few years later I married a saint of a man who loved me like crazy and was very patient with my body issues. Insane crash diets + heroic exercise regimens followed by binging slip-ups followed by a discouraged and depressed period caused my weight and fitness to fluctuate wildly, wonderful guy) and made him not enjoy it. He couldn't have an orgasm with me, and every time we ""gave up"" and finished ourselves off, my belief that my disgusting body was unable to satisfy any man (even one that I knew loved me) was cemented further. (Unfortunately, this was pre-internet, so I had never even HEARD of a man not being able to orgasm - I was CONVINCED for years that there was NOTHING wrong with HIM, and it was entirely MY FAULT for being unattractive - we didn't make the ""pain/stress connection"" for several years.)

    .

After our divorce I was in a bit of a crisis-induced manic episode. We now had the internet and I had ""worked out"" a lot of my self-image issues. I went into an impressive slut-phase (we had the internet now!) and gave casual sex a go. I met men that were completely unsatisfying lovers

    .

Enter my first rebound relationship: A pretty good guy who was eerily like my ex-husband in a lot of ways. On one weekend at his place he showed me some pictures on his computer and oops! a picture of him with a breathtakingly beautiful ex-girlfriend was in the mix. He quickly and sheepishly forwarded past it, and while I KNEW it was a bad idea, I just ""had"" to see it, you know? One thing leads to another and I am acting completely nonplussed as my rebound guy shows me concrete proof that I am, in fact, the least attractive woman he has ever been with. I didn't bitch, or cry, he was an honest person

    .

UNTIL that night. We started getting undressed and I was trembling. He noticed and asked what was wrong and I started to cry. I explained how embarrassed I was and how silly I knew I was being, it IS true that most of the women before you have been unusually attractive, but I'm with you now, and I don't mind this (indicating my body) and NONE of them have been as sweet or as intelligent as you are, and that (indicating my brain) is what makes you beautiful to me.""

    .

A very sweet thing to hear

    .

We broke up months later for unrelated reasons and a while later I meet the next one I was trying to fill the husband-size-hole left in my life with. The only thing HE had in common with the other two is his career choice. Other than that, but at the time, I was REALLY trying to make it work.

    .

Then we had the ""where is this relationship going"" talk. He said that he didn't know, he had never really envisioned himself ending up with ""someone like me""... I am capable of remaining cool and collected when I need to be, so I asked him to elaborate. He hemmed and hawed and then said ""Well, I've never been attracted to your body type before, but I DO enjoy having sex with you anyway"" I said ""OK, what else did you mean by ""someone like me""""? He had nothing. NOTHING else.

    .

I clarified that he WAS saying that I was a perfect girlfriend in EVERY WAY except for his lack of sexual attraction. He said ""yes

    .

I haven't been with a man in almost two years

    .

I understand where I'm getting all these messages of inadequacy and I do my best to tune them out. I understand what was REALLY going on in my failed relationships now. I am smart

    .

Please believe me when I tell you that I am not ""obsessed with beauty"" as most women are. I don't have a large shoe collection. I don't cake on makeup. I don't struggle with my aging face and hair and body as so many women my age do. I am ""aging gracefully"" in that I've accepted it and I make an effort to stay physically active only for health reasons. I have other things that I value about myself

    .

My little sister is HOT. She dates celebrities. She has a well managed eating disorder (in that she is incredibly thin and goes to insane lengths to keep herself that way, and that she was in for a rude awakening when age catches up to her... But when I am honest with myself, I realize that my body image shapes my life more than hers does for hers.

    .

What else can I do? I ""get it"" intellectually

    .

TL;DR I am smart enough to realize how stupid these hangups are and where they come from

Edit: Holy shit. I had NO IDEA this comment was going to be so long as I was typing it. I guess I really needed to get some of this off my chest!

TL:DR for male redditors: STOP BEING SO MEAN AND CRITICAL OF WOMEN'S BODIES ON THE INTERNET! EVEN IN THESE ANONYMOUS FORUMS THEY ARE MORE HURTFUL THAN YOU REALIZE!

For the past year my long term boyfriend and I have been discussing moving to Chicago when our lease expires at the end of June. Moving to Chicago has been a life long dream of mine

My entire family thinks I'm being selfish by continuing on with my plans to move to Chicago while my mom is in the hospital. My father suggested I move home to help take care of my mother when she gets out of the hospital, and I know she wouldn't want me to put my entire life on pause because of her injury. I assured my family I will be there as much as possible to visit and assist as much as I can. Right now my mom is unable to speak because she has a trach, otherwise I would love to talk to her about everything, to get her real feelings on the matter.

I feel awful because I obviously love my mom so much. She is literally, and did everything together. It devastated me when I heard she will probably be confined to a wheel chair for the rest of her life. But I'm trying to remain very optimistic. She still has good use of her upper body, she still is cognitive, and most importantly she's alive. And she's STRONG. When she get's out of the hospital I know she's going to want to be as independent as possible.

So is there something wrong with me??? Am I being selfish? Should I consider my father's request to move home or move closer? Chicago will always be there

1367808029.0,1drowp,[26M] My life is an absolute disaster...,positivelyrelentless,9,3,16,"Where to begin? I'm 26


Until about a year ago I was completely unemployed


I don't even make enough to pay rent and food. My parents still support me at this age. It's fucking beyond shameful. In spite of their admittedly gracious and voluntary support


I hate how pathetically weak and absent my father was during my entire childhood, I feel like it's a learned skill I had to create solely through observing normal people. If I were to emulate my father, I'd play piano all day in a dark apartment with no friends while brooding over a bottle of gin on how superior I am to the rest of the human race.


My mother is honestly worse. She's a school principal and a PHD in psychology


My entire childhood was dealing with this kind of abuse, outwardly fake-nice person and because she actually (in a sick hypocritical twist) reports other parents to Social Services she made sure to let me know that I ""would never be believed"" and that she knew ""exactly where the line of proof was"". I short, I feel like I have Hannibal Lector for a Mom. She can take any little piece of information and use it to damage you on the inside.


This is also why I have huge reservations about seeing a psychologist, I've learned to befriend the person with the most keys first. I guess I have learned some things in my life.


I hate being dependent on my family for all these reasons and more, yet this poison has seeped into every facet of my existence.


My ""friends"" and women my age either walk all over me


I managed to get sent to boarding school for supposedly ""gifted"" kids. I fit in terribly there, but so far have only added that to the list of things in my life that I have reneged on or betrayed in principle.


I have terrible trust issues. Especially with women. The first girlfiend I ever had was in college. She ended up urinating on my clothing and leaving them outside in the snow to freeze. I guess I can pick them just as good as dear old dad. She was also a wiccan who believed in cursing people. I guess witchcraft wasn't enough


My major was in film and video


I have met good people along the way. My scoutmaster was probably the closest thing to a father I can think of. He would be very disappointed in me however and the direction my life has taken. I also met a nice girl who was very religious on behalf of her nutjob parents. I stayed with her for three years


After splitting with her, but if I was being honest I'd say that I wasn't truly caring about another persons wellbeing. Now if anything I feel more shallow, like I lost something. I can't say that I'm a virgin, because I've had sex, but I still have no idea how to relate to women sexually. I'm just an asshole without principles.


Right now I'm sitting in an appartment covered with filth


I know that I just wrote a fucking epic cry post on the internet. I don't know what else to do. I thought that I would have died by now in so many ways

Hello reddit. Throwaway since my friend is a redditor.

I have a friend who has had a rough life. One of the worst situations I have ever heard of which I can't get into details about. We've been friends for about 12 years.

His parents bailed on him and since high school he has basically just been couch surfing with our old high school friends and then living with the mom of one of our friends up until about a year ago.

He has no money, is depressed, and hasn't been able to catch a break. My wife and I decided that maybe we had the ability to be a lucky break for him. So we invited him to live with us at no cost and he wouldn't have to pay us back provided he try and find a job and do whatever he could to improve his situation.

We bought him a bed, provided him with his own room, his own bathroom, a laptop, an internet connection, a prepaid phone, and we hooked him up with a social worker in our county after he could be considered a resident of our state.

We also set him up with health insurance for the first time and he also was able to start seeing a counselor/therapist.

We had hoped all of this would give him the opportunity to finally break out of his situation. This is where it gets bad.

In a year he hasn't so much as gotten an interview. He received one phone call regarding something that didn't turn out to even be a real job offer. He spends most of his days playing League of Legends

Now my wife and I would like to buy a house but we can't save enough for a down payment and closing costs because we've sunk about $11k into providing for our friend.

Now our lease is coming up and we would like to move out to a 1 bedroom that is much cheaper than it is in our current apartment so that we can save for our house. But what happens to him? He has no where to go. We can't talk to him because he just shuts down

I feel like I've done everything I can but I can't even get feedback from him because he refuses to talk about anything serious. What do I do reddit?

TLDR: Took care of every need and then some for a friend for 12 months, and he has no where to go. What do I do?

i've been in a relationship for a couple of years now.. we were friends first for a couple of years before that

The past couple of years have had their ups and downs.. the ups have been amazing. i've never opened myself up to someone as i have with her, i'm a grown adult and my twenties are in my past.

The downs.. well there's been a few of them but they've been recurring themes.

when I met her, as she wants to settle down, have kids, all that stuff that i want too. she's done great for herself with very little help to say the least, and i guess the least she could expect is someone to at least have done what she's done so the marriage i set up from both sides..

problem is i wasn't quite there.

I sorta messed up through high school and took the long route to uni, and i pretty much met her about a year after i finished. i was on a grad wage back then, so needless to say this position wasn't hugely impressive when shes the same age as me but had been working for 4-5 years.

to add fuel to the fire, non financial, they've been a huge burden.

anyways in the time that ive known her, albeit with pretty much 0 equity. That's all well and good, except we aren't really in a position to marry.

culturally, as her family now know about us.

i don't even know how to sum up everything into where i'm at now, ive taken out some loans. we're talking a sizable some, to the point where the bank won't give me any more loans. i haven't blown it at the casino or on booze or anything like that. most of it has gone to constructive things. ie. work that needed to be done on the house, furnishings, etc.

only problem is now there's pretty much nothing left, but when we start talking about marriage, wedding, honeymoon, kids etc - well it ain't looking great.
i've asked my parents for help, which i can totally understand.. they helped me out with my credit card debt but i have to repay them monthly (nowhere near what i'd have to pay normally to work the credit card debt).

that solves that problem

i have some stocks that i can sell, but then we're starting our life in massive debt. this stresses her out in a big way.. and fuck - you cant blame her.

the main part of the debt problem is a period of about 3-4 months when i took out the money. we sort of discussed it, furnishings, etc.. there were a shit load of outgoings and i lost track of it all.. i fucked up.
to add fuel to the fire, as it involved her family etc.. for a while she had cut all ties, but i know in the past few weeks they've spoken briefly a couple of times and it's driving me insane. i feel like becoming one of those crazy bf's that keeps tabs on her, but know that'd just be fucked up.

so now, which i don't really want.. i actually have trouble imagining life without her - i'll have to rebuild myself, both financially but also mentally, emotionally, socially, and i just don't have the energy for that. i dont have the energy to even think about finding someone else, yet i can't stand the thought of being alone. i really dont know what to do with myself, whilst i know everyone says this after a relationship, and yeah

i dont know what the question is here.. i guess i just need advice.. maybe someone to reassure me that all is not doomed.... i just dont know what i want from here really..

There's a long version of the story and a significantly longer version. This is the (less) long version. Don't worry




At the time I was graduating high school, then go to work, get off at midnight or so, and get 6 hours of sleep. 



H was perfect. My dream come true. We had classes together throughout highschool, beautiful, sweet, Christmas birthday, graduated valedictorian, and went off to UF for BioChemical Engineering.



We had a great relationship. We rarely argued and never yelled at each other. I loved {I paused far too long before typing that ""d""} her, and I tried not to push it on her. I'd do anything for her. {More happens in this time, that is omitable}



I proposed to H and she said she wanted to wait.



I had a thing about lying and wouldn't even tell a tiny white lie. I lied to everyone I knew and said I didn't get into any college. I enlisted in the Marine Corps for a 5 year active duty contract a month before graduating high school



Three months of bootcamp, trimmed on the outside with random drawings. Each one had the same basic questions and random things that happened. Towards the end of bootcamp I get a letter saying she wasn't coming to my graduation (Oct 14th) because she had an exam.



A U.S. Marine now, but it felt like she didn't care anymore. Like something changed and I couldn't figure it out. On my 8th day of leave I find out my recruiter got me two weeks of Recruiter's Assistance (RA) so I could stay in the area for a bit longer before I leave for Marine Combat Training (MCT). Just about every day I worked 10 hours in the recuiting office and drove up to see her. Did I say this was over a 2 hour drive? Still seemed like something was bothering her.



Three days before I leave for MCT I give up, a little touching, and I stop. I drop her back off at her house. I can't go through with cheating on H, even if she was about to break up with me.



Next day I go up to see her, progressing further and further. I didn't bring a condom because I wasn't expecting any of this. No sex because of that alone. We wake up the next day, get dressed, eat breakfast, and I tell her I went out with that other girl the night before last. She tells me to leave after, and I beg for forgiveness. I leave and she breaks up with me via text.



At MCT, which was a bullshit lie. {More happens in this time, that is omitable}



I graduate from MCT Dec 6th and get orders to Pensacola, and we spend the night together. We get back together. I made a point to drive and see her every chance I got.



Fast forward to MLK day weekend when I was in Gainesville (the place where UF is) with H. We spend the night together and we end up having sex in the middle of the night. Morning after pill. {More happens in this time



I drive back to Pensacola and begin feeling extremely guilty for the entire situation of the weekend before. I felt like I raped her



After a month we got back together again, broke up again, back together. {A shit ton more happened here, but for legal purposes I'm omitting}



At the beginning of May 2012 I decided to take 10 days of leave between Pensacola and my next orders to Quantico. I spend every day with H. All is well for the first time in months. Now, FL, so I couldn't see H any time I wanted. I could afford to fly H up to visit once a month. H supported this idea at first, but after a couple weeks didn't want to fly up anymore. This eventually caused us to break up again, though I still wanted to be with her.



I took leave again in August to have lunch with H on, I flew home, borrowed a car, drove a couple hours, and had lunch with H. Then we went back to her dorm and watched some shitty horror movie, and talked for hours. She said something to the affect of ""you can't just come back here and act like everything is how it used to be."" The last thing I said to her was ""happy anniversery H.""



I finally resolved it would never work out between us. I don't even remember what happened the other four days of that leave. I don't remember the trip back to Quantico. I got extremely depressed until November.



I was sitting in the barracks one night and I decided I needed to go out, new computer, etc. Still every day I think about H. 



I got better about thinking about H every day. It got to about every other, malls, or listen to piano. I couldn't talk to anyone on Christmas.



So two nights ago there were 3 active duty Marines killed (well

At the moment, drinking in swanky downtown bars (he spent the night at his downtown office on Friday because he was too drunk to drive home). On Saturday I was very close to committing suicide by overdosing. He wasn't around that night because he was spending the night at his friend's house. My almost suicide was not because he wasn't home but due to my own inability to overcome depressive feelings for the past 14 years. I told him about my almost OD while we were in bed on Sunday night. His reaction caught me off guard. I expected him to be supportive and reassuring, to tell me that he loves me and that I deserve better than suicide. Instead his reaction was defensive and angry. We were cuddling and he separated from me while he started talking about my self pity and allowing myself to spiral down to that degree. I corrected him and told him that I did not have a ""pity party"" as he said but instead reached out to reddit for help and distraction. I told him about the other things that I've been doing to help myself fight the depression. His response was a simple ""Well that's good."" 

I tried talking to him about my feelings regarding the relationship. I told him it feels like the relationship has an expiration date and that maybe if we treated it as such we could have a better time for now. He said that he always treats it as such because he doesn't know where our futures will take us. He reminded me that we had previously agreed to focus on the present in our relationship without stressing about the future. I told him I felt that he doesn't focus on the present with our relationship and that I feel he takes me for granted when he chooses to spend all of his available time with his friends without making an effort to do something outside of the house with me. He didn't really respond to this. I told him that part of my trying to fight my depression is when I ask him to do things with me, no real response. He said he doesn't want me to be co-dependent.

On Sunday my mom sent me a coupon for a fancy downtown restaurant and said I should use her credit card to go on a date with my bf. I talked to him about it and we mentioned doing it tonight, too.

When that happens rather than just making some kind of coherent response about the subject, I'm privately racing away thinking about it to myself, and then never really responding, or just going ""Hmm"" and leaving it at that.

TL;DR: I feel like I can't get really close to anyone. Beyond a superficial level, normal romantic relationship. I feel like I'm really deficient somewhere. I'm seriously doubting my interpersonal skills. I have been for like 3 years now.

I'm 35 and a guy. I spend all day lamenting my lack of sex. I feel completely unwanted and socially inept, a NSA from craigslist, and a two-dater from okcupid), so obviously I'm not completely hideous but I feel completely the opposite.

Addendum: I remembered a 4th woman sex partner. An escort. Lah-di-dah.

I'm on antidepressants (initially for ocd) and I see a psychologist. He said something about how I talk about wanting sex but that if that's really what I wanted I could just hire escorts

I have only ever had success with women I've online. That is not true. When I was 19 I met a girl that was obviously (looking back, then the next day she took an hour-long bus ride to meet me for dinner. More subtle than sucking on my fingers, but obviously (looking back) a sign of interest to which I was oblivious. Or perhaps afraid to advance on.

Since breaking up with my first gf I have vastly increased my social life. I made a bunch of new friends on meetup.com and go out often for karaoke, met people and had a lot of fun, but nothing came of it. I tried to stay in touch with some women that I danced with and shit, but get nothing in return. That's not true. One girl responded to my text messages, but I was really only texting her out of desperation. I know she's not for me. I had tried to kiss her, got denied, she pointed at her cross necklace. Also she laughed at me when I told her I live with my mom. Why did I even stick around? Desperation.

I've given oral to a man twice since the gf, and got numbers and made plans, only to back out at the last second. I tell myself it's because I'm paranoid of disease. Perhaps I am too paranoid? I also tell myself that if I had a friend that was interested I'd be more likely to follow through. I also tell myself that if I was seduced or whatever, I'd be down. I have this desire to be a worthless cum target for a group of men. I think there's something here about feeling so desperate, and knowing that generally men are easier to get than women, and would be an easier path toward sexual gratification of any kind.

Like I said, and the sex with my more recent 6 month friend was just crap. She was way more experienced than me, and knew exactly how she wanted it. Also she seemed to have this strong idea of gender roles and foreplay progression that I wasn't able to fulfill, and since I was so concentrated on that I couldn't maintain an erection. So I feel like a virgin or something. I don't know what that means. Scared? Incompetent?

I'm depressed. I hate myself. I had everyone. I tell my mom, then i'm sad again. Then she thinks i'm so selfish because i'm not happy with the things i have. I am! i swear.

1355293327.0,14poyw,28 yr old guy who has never been in a relationship is in some serious retrospection.,chi_pit,8,0,13,"Dear Reddit

I am neither drunk not raged while I write this. Just trying to get some fresh perspective as I feel I may be too biased about myself.I apologize in advance for the long thread and though it is nowhere near my entire life history, or popcorn, and let's begin....

So here' the tl; part of it
28 yr old Indian male. I come from a fairly liberal family and even though my father came from an impoverished background

Though I was never a brilliant student, I quit my job to pursue my grad studies in the US. I have been in the US since 2008 and although I have had my share of disappointments, I am mostly a content person. I have never had to worry about money as I earn quite well or atleast well enough to keep me happy and do sometimes hear from my friends that I am reckless in my spending.

I realize that as with any other ethnicity/gender/nationality there are pre-conceived notions/prejudices/stereotypes and I try my best to clear any such misconceptions. I am not trying to act 'American', ethnicity and gender so there my background has never held me back from being friendly to anyone.

The things that has been a bit more disappointing, considering the perception about people who work in the technology field; being too geeky, socially ackward, etc. irrespective of gender, I am a fairly outgoing person. I may be a bit laconic at time, but I am no miser with words. In-fact I'm a sales consultant so I am definitely not a person stuck to his computer screen in some corner cubicle all day or living in my mom's basement. As Humpty Dumpty says in 'Alice in Wonderland', ""When I use a word

Now
let me give you some more information.

Though I'd spend 6-8 hrs in a weekend playing games on my Xbox, read daily and play in two sports leagues. I help organize and take-part in charity events and in August, me any my friends raised $2500 for the school district I live in. I help organize several meetups every month and meet people from different countries and backgrounds.

I consider myself to have good tastes, music, fashion and even though I'm a skinny guy weighing 130lbs, I do pay attention to my grooming, not too much, but I'm presentable and care how I dress.

So, right? Now, that you see ladies and gentlemen, is the problem. I am not choosy, but I am not too liberal either. I don't strike up a conversation with a woman with an intention of sleeping with her, I've tried that in my early 20s and know better now. I am not that guy who gets friend-zoned always, though I've been friend-zoned a couple of times. I have quite a few lady-friends and I've always treated them with respect.

I am also not that guy who pretends to be a girl's friend waiting to chance upon an opportunity

Normally, I have always felt that there will be a time and moment when I will find that special person but the past couple of weeks have been a bit concerning of and a time of bit of self-doubt. First, one of my closest friends who had abhorred being in a relationship got hitched. He is madly in love and plans to get married next year. Second, as I was speaking to my other friend, he asked me if I was ok. I don't have the faintest clue on why he got that impression, but I did not sound nowhere near being depressed or sad when I was talking about my friend who got hitched.
Before I become overwhelmed my cynicism

I've been on dating sites with almost no success, maybe it's true but my friends who have read my profile and who wouldn't mind throwing in an honest opinion haven't found anything deceiving about it. Yet, irrespective of no-preference for race, colour, ethnicity, I've never managed to find a girl I could be in a relationship with.

Clearly

The whole while, I'm feeling guilty as hell for not thanking them (sometimes these are pretty expensive gifts), but at the same time I'm getting some weird thrill from it. I don't understand it.

He emailed me twice asking me how things were going and I never responded. And it's not like I just saw the email and said ""delete"" and moved on. Oh no, that email lingered on my mind for weeks. Every morning I would wake up and think ""ok, just email him today. it's been a ridiculous amount of time, but you can still just apologize and get back on track"" And then I would spend most of the day procrastinating. I would go to bed and my eyes would shoot open just before I fell alseep and I would think ""what the FUCK? why would I let two weeks go by and not email him back? besides sabotaging myself, it's just rude. what is wrong with me?""

This has made me avoid opportunities to have sex with girls that I’m close to for fear of being awful in bed. Even if they were really sweet about it when they realised I was a total novice

 I thought the best way to get around this would be to find a random girl and have a one night stand. But after a while now that hasn’t happened.

There’s this girl who’s liked me for about a year now (although she’s dated other guys) and I’ve slowly fallen in love with her. But I’ve never done anything about it because my anxiety about performing remains. Like last Friday, but I just sneaked off and went home alone.

I can tell she’s getting really frustrated with me and will likely give up/find someone else soon. 

**Questions:** Should I try to quickly hand in my V-card to a random (even craigslist or some shit) and hope to cure my anxiety (at least I’ll have some idea of what to expect)? Or should I go for it with her this weekend (or asap) and risk it being a total sexual disaster and losing her because of my insecurities?

Any help would be hugely appreciated – I feel like if I don’t slay this demon now I’ll be stuck here forever. Especially if you also didn’t lose your virginity until late

I need to be extremely nice/kind/loving/motherly because they probably wouldn't like me otherwise. If I'm really nice to people, they'll love me back? If I do everything right, listen to them always, be a nice

But it's not like that. People walk over me. They don't even pay attention to how much I bend over backwards and suppress my needs for them. I can't help but to feel angry

My family's love for me never seems to be enough. I don't take their love seriously. Their love feels fake even though I know that my mom truly loves me. 

Most of my issues are probably rooted in my low self-esteem. I feel ambivalent about myself. I don't value myself at all. Whenever my parents tell me that I should take care of myself more, I feel disgusted. Like why should I take care of myself? I feel more of a ""rush"" when I take care of others. When I have to comb my hair or apply makeup, I feel bad. I would rather hurt or hinder myself in order to make someone else happy, it could be someone that I just met, if I hurt myself just to hear them say ""thank you so much"" then it's well worth the pain. If I had the courage, I would have killed myself a long time ago, someone around the world truly deserves food/water/air/etc more than me.


I have a serious emotional hole inside my soul and I don't know how to fix it. Being wanted, more, more. It's never enough. The only time it feels like it's enough is when I take hydrocodone or oxycodone. 

I don't abuse them a lot but I'm starting to greatly preferred ""high me"" over the ""regular me"". When I take drugs, kindness, etc. I'm starting to get mild opiate withdrawals and I'm scared of getting addicted (I've already seen the full extent that addiction brings on families) but the feeling of apathy and satisfaction is extremely alluring.

More recently, the problem is that I work with these people. I felt like I had been played in so many ways that I wanted to throat punch everyone.

This isn't the first time that I had experienced something like this. EVERY time that I have had a romantic interest in someone, looks out for you a lot, buys you everything you want, wants you to be happy even if that means I am miserable, all that nonsense. I know that this is a problem when interacting with girls I like because these are things that they are not instinctively attracted to, they actually are probably more turned off by it then anything. I have however also decided that I am not going to change something so ingrained and positive (for me anyway) just to appeal to women. So I have to suck it up I guess. 

That experience however left me with the most bitter feelings toward pursuing a relationship then the previous girls that shut me down, but its been a few months and my mentality hasn't changed. 

I am still very curious though as to what I am missing out on. People complain about their relationships all the time, what are the cons? What is the experience like?

My friend Victoria (28) and I (26) met when we were 18 and 16
I was lucky enough to see her 3 weeks prior during our yearly ""friend-cation"" as we call it. She was perfectly fine and in good spirits. All smiles and good humor as usual. 
Three days before she died she started having flu like symptoms and just got NyQuil and tried to tough it out. Next thing I know I get a phone call on my way to work that she's fucking dead. 
Naturally, all the while only half believing it was reality. 
Everyday that the funeral got closer it became more and more real. I found myself slowly falling apart. When i saw her in that casket i lost my shit. That wasn't her in there. Since then I've been experiencing deep depression, bouts of crying fits that leave me hyperventilating, complete lack of appetite (I haven't had a single morsel of food in 3 days now), and loneliness even though I have had an overwhelming amount of support and love pouring in from friends, coworkers, and family. Nothing seems to be helping. Everyone says just remember the good times but even the best memories break me down because I start thinking how we'll never get to make new ones. We'll never be each others brides maids, we'll never get to raise our future children together. I feel like I lost a part of myself. Like I have a hole in me that can't be filled. I feel crippled. Like I should just walk in front of a bus right now to make this feeling stop. 
I'm already trying to bury myself in my work, but of course she's on vacation until August 2nd. I just feel like despite the fact that I have all these people surrounding me and offering their support, they couldn't possibly understand. I get angry when I see people who are happy. I call her phone just to hear her voice on her voice mail. I tweet her because I feel like some how that's the only way I can talk to her. And I feel like all of that makes me crazy. Does it? Is this normal? I feel guilty that my last words to her couldn't have been more profound. Guilty that I didn't tell her enough how much I loved her and how much knowing her molded me into the person I am. A person I can be proud of. I'm afraid she never knew that.

Usually what happens is I'll see a girl I find interesting or think I like a lot, everything will go smoothly, and somewhere between asking her out and the first date I just don't feel strongly about them, or I'll feel like I like them as a person but I don't have any strong feeling about them.

1338858253.0,ul8vm,25F I am sabotaging my degree,throwawaydegree111,8,0,2,"Hello my dear redditors

Here is the reason why I have issues. I realized I do not care about finishing school, lost and confused. And angry.

I post and lurk around

I am 25y old female. Ever since I was a kid I was guided by my family to prepare to enter a University, make a career for myself, marry a good man, and lead a happy consumerist life.

My family comes from a country where economic stability has been a huge issue for decades. My parents moved out of there into a new

My father never finished his studies when he was young. His own mother (my grand mother) pushed him into University, and moved on with his life. However I grew up influenced by his ""dream"": the big corporate management life, nice house with a yard, car, etc.

Of course

My mom finished her degree
When they got married she devoted herself to the family, helping our father feed us. Sometimes she had time for her art, usually not.

When I was applying for a high school, and I liked literature... However I did not feel specially talented for anything except sitting and reading science fiction and fantasy. I applied for two high schools.  One was more generally oriented - and I failed to enter there. The second one was sort of a business school, and I spent my next 4 years there, preparing to actually apply to University, which was always some sort of huge GOAL that my life was running towards to.

When I was applying for a University, or what I was good at. I was scared to enter any University where there would be lots of thesis and writing - the language I study in is not my native language, and I have not managed to achieve the level of writing style in it that I would love to. 

I knew that there are Gender studies, and realized that I love all that stuff in the stores and just want money... 

So I applied to business University

Those years were good

My path seemed sort of straight

On a side note, or had any sense for ""rebellion"". If there was an argument with them, I would break down and cry, and try to think of a solution with them, because I always valued their opinion, and I think of them very highly.  I have a younger sister, and she was always the ""artistic rebel"". I was supposed to be the ""normal"" one. 

Oh how I want to laugh now at this.

When I turned 25 years old

I started taking anti depressants

Two months before I was supposed to finish University, even when I want to pull out my hair and yell (for being happy, or for being scared). I never loved like this.

How and why this happened is a different story - but I entered a whole new world of information while I was finding my new identity (sexual, need to help people love themselves, need to protect. And need to learn, of course. Otherwise I would never even get to this point in my academic life.

I got intoxicated with the freshness of it all

The trouble was, and they were confused and scared, and I was feeling oppressed and angry that they do not trust me.

I packed bags and moved out. They were so stressed about my studies they even had no time to worry about me being a lesbian. It was a shock for them - that I absolutely defied them. 

I felt like I was hitting puberty at 25. Better late then never?

I wanted to pass that final exam, that I am still a valuable ""normal"" person that I was when I lived with parents. That I am still ""great"".

Of course

After the first try

It is soon. Very soon. In a few days.

And... I am not ready for it

My parents will be so disappointed. And the last chance would be after summer

I just do not care... I do not care about it anymore. Is it possible that one can change so much in half a year? Is it possible that now, and try them out?

I have issues. I do not know if I feel more sad that I will disappoint my parents, and I felt comfortable in this pleasant zone.

And why cannot I just make my silly brain remember all that stuff from books so I can at least say to my parents ""OK I have the degree
Instead of that I sit here writing this huge post.

Thank you if you read this huge wall of text

I guess I would like to know if anyone was in a similar situation and how you have dealt with it.

TL;DR After years of studying I realized I do not care about finishing my University. I feel guilty and sad that I will disappoint my parents.

Because of these things, I have very little self confidence, and all in all I am a weak person.

I was 8 years old. My mother was very quirky, and family pets (I still trust animals more than people). When my parents split up, they shared custody.

My mother is manic depressive and bipolar, she told me and my siblings (I'm the youngest) that my father had let one of our cats outside so it would die, because he hated cats (she still believes he tortures animals for fun in some sort of dungeon in his new house...yeah).

Then, and that's why my father was ""mean"" to her. In this case, she thought he was mean because he got upset that he'd work all day and come home to a disgusting house and he'd have to clean up.

This is about when my dad moved out.

Then, that we had been repressing all of those memories, and that my father doesn't remember doing it because he has multiple personalities.

I was the youngest, who at this point I trusted more than my dad, being convinced that her horrible delusions were somehow true. I spent half my life being psychologically tortured by the only person I truly trusted.

When I would be trying to go to bed at my mom's house, until I would break down crying and just tell her she was right so she would stop. She convinced me I was in danger every time I would go live with my father.

At my dad's house he would read me Harry Potter before bed.

I lived two separate lives.

I've been coerced to lie to police officers on several occasions, she gave no fucks).

This went on for months, and my family, therapist, and lawyer were all standing there. I was terrified.

I took out a phone my mother gave me to call her on

I ignored them

At this point I had already broken down. I became dissociated from reality and started crying, she wouldn't have dropped me off there under threat of arrest, she was just a manipulative cunt, and the shock was too intense for me.

After that, but we ignored her, it still hurt to be constantly reminded of the fact that the mother I love is gone.

I don't talk to my mother anymore. I have huge trust issues and I can't deal with any level of dishonesty. I can't handle being yelled at or someone even raising their voice to me

I don't really have a question, and that I have a lot of boundaries that can't be crossed.

I go to therapy and I'm making good headway, really sucks sometimes to know how bad things can get, even with one of the people you are supposed to be able to rely on and trust no matter what.

My understanding is that she is essentially punishing herself. She hates being helpless, or she will see it as a huge failure (and not try it again).

I am also taking care of our economy

This is probably gonna be a long post as I have a few things on my chest so grab some popcorn and enjoy the schadenfreude. 

I have a few problems with my life to fully explain why I need to go back a few years. Four years ago I was on top of the world there really wasn't anything I couldn't do (or it felt like it anyhow). I lived my childhood dream of being a magician
All this changed in the spring of 2008 as I was bitten by a tick which didn't even notice at the time. My body crashed on the bus a few days later and after a few very painful weeks of test the doctors discovered that I had attracted Tick-borne encephalitis [TBE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_encephalitis) which easily put is a brain disease.
This disease left me in a hospital bed for six months and bedridden for another one and half years. Not only that (it is now all of the depressing stuff starts) I had also lost the sense of hunger or the opposite the sense of replete after a meal. Not only that so had my nervous system also taken a good beating. I lost feeling in my hands aswell as daft aching in my body.  

I wish this was the end of my problems but no. During the time I was sick I got two phone calls from two friends and that's it. I was home alone sick and nobody cared enough to check how it was with me. So when was feeling a better after two years I contacted a few friends that I known for the longest time and tried to pick up the pieces of my former life. I was presented with a choice either I stay for the rest of my life living on early retirement or try to do something with my life. 

The choice was clear as water to me, sleep for three hours, read whatever I needed to read, make food and going to bed around 21.00 (09.00pm) otherwise I couldn't function at all in school. 

The semester ended and I got back to my hometown to meet some of my old friends.
Here did things go very wrong. If you haven't noticed it already I have issues with staying completely serious all the time and I make bad puns all the time
Everyone else in the room just sat there silent and didn't say a word so took the hint, why am I here, what the hell am I doing, do I even belong here anymore.

So I took the train back to the university and my student apartment and spent the rest of the summer in a empty town by myself. So I deiced to change to restart my life yet again so started to force myself into meeting new people. Nothing haven't really came out of this yet (still doing it I'm stubborn as fricking donkey) but I think I found the problem. I gotten huge trust issues with other people
With that said I haven't stopped trying since as I see it if I stop trying I might aswell try to be superman and try to fly of a cliff.

(Friendly note: Go and get more popcorn or a drink)

Right now four years after everything went to hell for me I'm still in school but my body can't really keep up with the pace anymore. It aches more then ever before and I have started to get a bit of twitches in my hands and according to my doctor it is stress related and I need to slow down in my life which I barley have

(Soon done I promise just 5 more hours...why are you looking at me like that?)

But lately I stated to want more I want meet someone and to be with someone. I never been in relationship in my life before I got sick and my body broke down I always said there is time for that later (oh the irony). And now I'm broken down husk of a man I used to be and I can't for justify bringing my own problems to someone that could and will find someone better then me. 
Even though I can see it being better this way with my head it is hard to kill off the feeling of it though. Which puts me in this very weird situation that I really don't enjoy a bit and to make it worse there is this girl that sometimes but not always pops into my head which just makes it even harder to accept the facts. Sometimes I wish my body could handle alcohol (I'm pretty sure a 5 year old girl is a better drinker then me).

(You still awake? Why am I asking if you are awake if you don't you won't read this...)

Anyhow that's my life so far and I have no idea what to do in the future. I'm trying to keep positive about it and soon not even my own personal bullshit won't be enough which is probably why I feel the need to write this here. Everyone has a breaking point and I'm getting close to mine.
So in the end I'm wondering if the struggle I'm going through is worth it and am I doing the right thing even? Questions I don't have the answer for right now. I don't feel I'm going anywhere and the problems and issues just keep coming and coming and I still remember when I lived my own dream like a bitter sweet treat.

I posted a thread a while back asking women what their sex partner number is. Recently I've become very insecure about my number. Yes, in the past one and a half years. First was with my ex, who pressured me into it. Second was with a rebound. I wasn't sure then that I wanted to have sex, but he was very convincing. Third was with another ex- who after became a FWB. Fourth was with an ex, who I cared about a lot. Fifth was with a FWB-type relationship. That one too I wasn't sure that I wanted to sleep with him. The last one was just oral, he was more persistent that we wait. He is now a FWB. So, I guess the ones I cared about I was fine with, I just felt cheap and bad about the situation.

* I never had a serious girlfriend and am still a virgin

* I got rejected so many times I can't count it anymore

* (Former) Best Friend *probably* fucked the girl I was dating while I was on vacation. Probably because I don't have a proof

* I've fallen in love with a girl I met a month later after this incident. But 'til today it's complicated and I don't know where we stand exactly. Somedays I could tell she's into me the other not and I still hadn't the chance to meet her alone without mutual friends and talk about my feelings

* Made out with another girl at a party recently. Mean yeah sounds awesome right? But it just didn't feel right. And when I found out she only turned 17 it made sense I couldn't connect with her emotionally. I always thought I would be so glad if a girl is totally into me

* Somedays I feel awesome

* This incident with the former best friend still comes up sometimes in my mind even when I don't want to. Can something fucked up like this ever go away *completely* out of my mind?

As a bit of background, he used me and ended up cheating on me, so I have trust issues with guys now along with trust issues with everyone else.

Several months ago, but sometimes I still find it hard to do anything sexual with him for fear of him just using me to get off or gain exp.

But the main problem I have is the damn emotional deadness I get. I really like and have feelings for him, and wanting to be anywhere else, alone. And of course it's impossible to show any type of affection towards him at this point, so I act cold and distant. It's terrible and completely not his fault, I just get that way due to my past. But if this goes on I will only get more angry and frustrated, mostly at myself, and will have to leave him. 

Not sure what to do. Probably should talk to him about it, and if so, how did you deal?

**BACKSTORY:**

So when I got to college, we saw a lot of each other and became really good friends; we also have a whole bunch of friends in common. 

Fast forward to the summer between freshman and sophomore year: She visits me in my hometown (several times) cause her family has a summer house there. It was during this summer that I realized that I didn't just think this girl was cute, she begins a yearlong study abroad program.  Don't get me wrong, sophomore year for me was fun, but it did feel like something (someone, really) was missing. And it wasn't for lack of contact; we skyped and talked on facebook quite a bit. But it just felt like something was missing. 

Fast forward to last September. I see her for the first time in about a year, I'm the happiest person in the world because I get to see M again.  So we spend a whole bunch of time together over the course of the semester, and my feelings start to get really strong for this girl. So one night, we're both at a party, and she talks to this other guy all night, and goddamn maybe it's selfish and jealous of me, but it hurt to watch. It made me feel physically sick. i texted my sister (I'm really close with both my sisters)

The next day I call M and ask her if we can talk. I go over to her place and we have a really long conversation that essentially boils down to me confessing my feelings for her and her telling me she's not going to date me. I left and went back to my place, and to give myself some space and try and get over her.  I do this for several weeks and she got the memo. So a couple weeks later I call her up and we begin to hang out again. Well, it turns out that I wasn't over my feelings for her. 

We're now pretty close to today chronologically. I talk to my sister and realize that I need more space/time away from M. So last night, and this visibly upsets her, but she understands and gives me one last hug.

I am still a virgin

My self esteem issues. I have have been overweight all my life. Like, and fairly happy and stable with my weight. What I am not happy with is my self esteem. After I lost the weight, I underwent several surgeries, including a double brachioplasty, an anchor incision tummy tuck, and a breast lift to take off the extra skin the fat left. It is a vast improvement over being a whale, but I still can't help but feel like Frankenstein's monster. 

I of course have stretchmarks everywhere from being overweight, from my cleavage down to about two inches above my ladybits, and from hip to hip. 

On top of this, from where I itch like crazy every winter, and am missing half of the big toe on my left foot from a law-mowing accident when I was 12. 

I don't feel sexy, I told my father I wanted to be an actress, and he told me straight to my face, ""Honey, you need to think about other jobs, you're not pretty enough to be an actress.""  My self esteem is in the ditch.  The few times anyone has ever called me beautiful or pretty, or cute

The guy I am seeing knows about all this, even if I have the desire to. I want to be able to be open with him, and I appreciate the things he says to me, but there is always a part of me that says, ""he's just being nice,"" or ""You're going to get your heart broken once he sees what you've done to yourself.""

It was over small stuff, such as not having a pitcher of tea in the fridge, or watching The Simpsons at night. Well my mom allowed the abuse to happen, and my father ended up cheating on my mom with another woman so they got a divorce.

Well my mom got custody of my brother and I and we moved into a small 2 bedroom apartment, so she met some man online named Kevin, talked to him about 2 months, and he lived in a different state so she paid his bus trip up here, and let him stay in the apartment! He ended up being crazy and schizophrenic and thought there were cameras in every vent and I was talking to her ex boyfriend.

I ended up getting taken away by social services when I called the police on him when they were fighting and they saw the hoarding and the extreme unclean conditions and took me to my dads house.

Moved in with my dad and his wife, just 5. I even tried telling my dad when he spoke to me and treated me as such I wanted to kill myself. He was unphased and said well there is a gun out in the shed so you might as well just take care of it.

All my life I've been a very shy and awkward person. One of the consequences of this is that I have always had problems relating to women. I wasn't well liked in grade school (I went to a private Catholic school, actually. Growing up, my sister acted mean and judgmental toward me at home, and my ""best friend"" acted the same way when I wasn't. This slowly took a toll on me over the years, and I grew to feel as though I was being scrutinized by everyone around me. I became a very emotionally guarded person and I feel like I've spent a lot of my life retreating inside my mind, cutting myself off from what I've always viewed as a hostile humanity. I never had a functional social life that involved actually opening up to people until I was well into my high school years, which is when I started making what I consider to be true friends for the first time.

I got my first kiss at 16 with my first girlfriend, looking back, a very prudish and emotionally distant person. She didn't talk much and intercourse was completely out of the question. We lasted 10 months and had very little sexual contact in that time. I lost my virginity in college at the age of 20 after eight months of dating my then-girlfriend (she would later go on to perform in an S&amp;M-style bondage show behind my back, an event that started the unraveling of my trust in her which eventually led to our breakup.) The pattern you should be noticing here is that my relationships have been relatively few and far between, and sex has always been distant and intimidating for me, even in the context of all of my serious relationships. I had a number of opportunities for casual sex late in high school and early college, but I was always too uncomfortable with the idea to ever go through with it. Maybe if I was strong enough  back then to step out of my comfort zone

Fast forward to present day: I've been out of college for six months and have been dating my current girlfriend (age 20) for about a month and a half. She is the first person I've had sex with since my ex and I broke up

Her history is far different than mine, and open. She has been sexually active since she was 14 and by her count I'm her 48th partner. Additionally, unlike my strictly monogamous history with the opposite sex, she has a history of maintaining a polygamous lifestyle. This in itself does not bother me, since all of those encounters happened before we ever got together. What bothers me is that the way in which her experience and outlook informs her behavior brings out my insecurities. I still put up my emotional guard often and maintain a strong personal bubble, but she is very flirty and physically friendly with those that she knows, including male friends, she also likes to go out and get drunk with said friends. Sometimes I go with her, teasing, and when she is out I find myself worrying that she is doing something that would hurt me if I ever found out. Not overwhelmingly or enough to induce a panic attack or anything like that

We have discussed this and she understands my position and my boundaries. I'm also being exceedingly careful to remember that my attitude is just as foreign to her as hers is to mine, ""play by one another's rules."" On a logical level I know that I have no real reason to worry or believe that she is being unfaithful, or to think that she doesn't care about me enough to take my sensitivities to heart when she is spending time with her other circles. The reality is that she is a passionate and genuine human being, but I'm just so vastly unaccustomed to her idea of what is normal that I have a hard time separating my emotions from my knowledge that I'm blowing things out of proportion. I know that I'm being overly worrisome and paranoid but I can't seem to shake it completely. I'm afraid that I'm putting her off by acting too possessive, effectively punishing her even though she has been nothing if not patient and understanding toward me.

She has helped me to get better but I'm afraid that it won't be enough. I've been trying to take a proactive role in acquiring a more healthy and realistic attitude but I'm afraid that my efforts will be too little too late. I really dig this woman and I don't want to fuck it up. I don't want to be like this anymore.

***Before I describe my problem in detail

I am a 29 year old male virgin. I have never been with a woman, never been loved or never been wanted by anyone (except for parents, maybe). They never hugged me as a kid and never said, ""I love you"" to me when growing up. I felt as if I grew up in a loveless family. Add to that, constant physical and verbal abuse that I endured as a kid from my dad. The relationship with dad while growing up was more fear based rather than love based. Though my dad is not an evil person inherently, he used to believe in the adage of 'spare the rod, spoil the child'. As an adult, and respect her tremendously for putting up with my dad. My dad also happens to have several backward notions (like women should not work

I was also addicted to internet sex chat rooms, but for some reason, now a days, I get bored with cybersex very soon. So internet sex chat rooms are not a major issue right now. I tried to substitute internet sex chat for real intimacy, because real intimacy, I could never get or experience. And that is my problem which is that I lack intimacy in life, I have no confidante to share things, who does not know how it feels to have someone special in life who loves you for what you are, but I don't have motivation to lose any weight as I think I have lost all zest for life. I was also bullied as a child in school and the emotional scars are present until today. Even now I can't handle confrontational 'bad people' and would rather capitulate than try to fight for my beliefs. In short

1. I am reasonably smarter than most people (am studying for a masters degree in computer science in a reputed US university right now). 

2. I can empathize with others

**Now my problem:**

I am a porn addict. I am a virgin, but without any success. It has increased to the point that it has started to interfere with my studies and work now. I used to joke that earlier masturbation acted as a stress buster in times of duress, but now I have realized that though it releases pressure in the short term, the long term psychological effects of it are going to scar me for life. How do I end this addiction? Should I go and have paid sex with a prostitute? I know I can't have any girlfriend who will love me in this life. So what do I do? I am not suicidal. At least yet. But not sure what the future holds for me.

Please don't give any religious advice as I am an atheist. Also thanks a lot if you have read until this far.

There's been a time where I was with a group of friends, yet all of them were couples, and at one point I felt absolutely awkward because I felt so out of place and that I couldn't relate to them on a level.

I'm a six teen year old male

Growing up

Some situations (that have happened):
Sitting on the bus stop, I can't (wont?) look at her, - just act like she doesn't exist. I also seem to ""behave"" awkwardly. 

I have tried marijuana before (and went out in public) - I honestly believe it does help me with calming me down.

I'm aware smoking is bad

Another situation
My mother introduced me to a girl (we were close friends when we were young apparently. I don't remember). We had dinner with her and her mother. I don't know why but it was really awkward. Then we went to her house and watched some TV. She started speaking to me but I (intentionally) killed the conversation with sarcastic remarks. 

I have little to no friends (handful) - Facebook is pretty useless for me (200+ of 'friends' I barley speak too).

I like computers
But I avoid those subjects in real life conversations. 
When someone mentions anything about computers

When I was in the fourth/fifth grade

Now that I speak about it it's still pretty embarrassing. 
I think that 'mistake' I've made pretty much lowered my self esteem to the lowest possible.

Because 7 years 'later'

I just feel like every single girl that went to the the same school as me in the fifth grade told the other girls

I do/did pretty bad in school - but I started to improve. Since I have no social life

I follow/believe no religion.
When I have an issue with something

I am considering joining a military branch.

I guess I should also add (if it matters) my parents were divorced when I was really young.

That has now caught up to me and kicked me in the ass

I lost my job a little over a month ago. I only had the job for 10 months, when I got fired, it seemed that everything that made people think I was special came crumbling down. When I had to move back in with my parents, off I went on a rollercoaster of emotions that I can't stop.

I just feel worthless because I no longer have any accomplishments worth praising, stop giving a fuck about what others think of me.

My parents and my boyfriend keep telling me to stop caring and just focus on me and what makes me happy to make the job-hunting period easier, and without a job or school, I don't have a place from which to draw that. I mean, I'm stooping so low that I'm looking for it in the dumbest places, like a League of Legends match with my boyfriend and his friends where I complained to him that I wasn't having fun because his friends weren't commenting on how well I was playing. He had to explain to me the seemingly obvious fact that a game should be played for fun, not to prove myself to others to siphon off their praise. But I can't separate the two, because part of the reason I play the game is because I want him to be proud of me and his friends to think I'm cool, it must not be true.  

I'm terrified that this will wreck my relationships with my boyfriend and my family

A bit of background... I've never been rewarded for planning anything. Everyone always tells me I need to plan better for my future, whether it's just a plan A or if plans B and C are made as well, nothing goes the way I expect. So I've gotten used to thinking on my toes. It makes me terrible at chess, but it makes me fantastic at putting out fires as they come up.

The problem is that whenever things are looking up in my life, huge drama comes up, family obligations take precedence, betrayals happen, I might have to move or I might get fired from a job... one way or another, my plans become moot. I've gotten so used to it at this point that I barely notice anymore. But I have now unwittingly convinced myself that I must be doing something wrong personally - that I don't DESERVE for my plans to ever come to fruition, either because I'm not preparing myself enough, however)

Well now what's biting me in the ass is my fear of losing everything. I have a ridiculously fantastic boyfriend now (28 yo) - we've been official for three months, just before he was gonna do the adorable childhood thing of passing me a ""do you like me?"" note at school, I lost him for more than fifteen years. We found each other online a year and a half ago, and we were immediately just as attached at the hip as we were when our ages were in the single digits. He makes me happier than any man ever has, our interests have remained similar even with a decade and a half of separation, he's handsome, he's intelligent, he's honest

Naturally, or he'll cheat on me, or he'll go to prison, or he'll have to move to another country without me for some reason, or he'll betray me somehow... I keep imagining these scenarios interfering with us eventually getting married, having a nice house, having kids together, I know it

EDIT: This has started to manifest itself in thoughts of sabotaging the relationship by cheating. I've cheated on past boyfriends before, just sleep with some other guy, who cares?"" but obviously I don't want to do this. Rationally I know it's not in my best interest to, so I've resisted, but I worry I'll let some guy sweep me off my feet with the promise of only temporary happiness and no future at all.

- He commented on my hair and how it looked different than last time

So I went and he ended up talking my ear off, spirituality (something I've gotten into lately too) and he also has Crone's Disease which he was hospitalized for and had surgery. :( I run a small business with my sister, a shop that caters to subcultures like anime and videogames. We're moving to a bigger location in a week. I told him about it and and he offered to help us out in any way. After he left my mom told me to keep in touch with him.

Part I: Me

I'm a 23 year old guy going to college, while at the same time attempting to have a riveting social life. And to say the least ive done very well for myself. But the issue is i live in a part of the country that is L-l-l-l-l-l-l-loaded. Mostly due to a trifecta of 3 very VERY large fortune 500 companies in the area. Now, im not wealthy at all, everything i own ive bought for myself.
Paid my own tuition, just not insurance. My folks are pretty poor as well and i focus most of my worth to not burden them at all.

Part II: the situation

My friends are pretty wild

Jake (kid who dad is a renown architect and who has been given a pretty sick apartment, pretty much being a phone jocky)

Craig (Dad runs the top dog precious metal distributor, and a pretty sick boat)

Craig and Jake are i guess youd say the top dogs here. Ive been friends with them for many years but lately our relationships have been strained. I have been getting chewed for not partying as much cause im so over loaded, last week I brought a girl whome ive became pretty close too our to craigs party land along the river for her birthday. I spent several hundred setting it up and inviting people and got a pretty good showing over about 80-100 people out there. Bought 1 am i was so plastered and worn from waking up for work at 5am I went to the girl and told her i was going to pass out in the truck, and to wake me when she is ready to go to sleep in the tent. Well, i pass out as planned and 5am rolls around and i awake to find im still in my truck, and my girl is no where to be found. So i wander over to my tent in the now mostly empty camp ground (except for one other car and craig's tent) and check. my girl was not in there so i begin to wander back to my truck. But i stopped and went to check on craig. To my horror i found him with her half naked on top of him passed out.

My natrual reaction was to of course snap and beat the tar out of him but  by the time i had got into the tent the both had woke up and i held back and just asked them if either had an F'ing explanation. Got my girls stuff

I proceeded to text craig to tell him he deserved an ass whopping and should be ashamed of himself. I then in anger posted a post on facebook saying ""Nothing like waking up at 5am to find your girl tangle legged with another dude""

I was called about 7am by jake whome ive known longer than craig and have been best friends with for years till he went on this recent money &gt; old friends tangent and he defended craig saying it wasent his fault and i have no right to threaten him nor be angry at either of them. That i should essentially just deal with it. My promp respond was to tell him he is just as much of a low life and hang up.

later that day i see both of them at the gym and jake cracks a joke in my direction

PART III: Situation now

I have NOTHING compared to these kids, people whome ive spent much of my time and money to help, bring up, and given nothing but honesty have left me high and dry to continue the party with the others. Ive pulled the closest strings i have and even offered a mellow olive branch to the culprits but to no avail. Even my soon to be room mate has ditched me. I litreally have nobody O.o

I just don't get why I need to look for all of this in a girlfriend. What's the point? I'm wayy too young to get married. Of my friends who are in relationships

But what is it that makes people want to be in a relationship so much? What do people get out of it?

I suppose that sense of having regular sex and someone who you can share intimite thoughts with about your dreams/goals whatnot, but I don't see that as any particular draw.

I moved out of my house for my new job two weeks ago, and I want to move back home and commute from home. When I tried talking to him, he was arguing why I should stay, and not listening to me. My feelings are always made to be invalid or stupid. He needs justification for everything I'm doing, and he said ""What’s making you depressed?"" It’s too hard for him to understand that ""Sometimes people go through depression without a specific reason"". I told him I’m sad all the time, but he doesn't know that.



I hate how I feel all the time. He is the last person I turn to when I need to talk to someone. I talk to my best friends and family first, I feel I've just been too dramatic and sad over nothing during the week, but the next week of neglect starts, and I feel shit all over again. The reasons I am holding on is because I feel the loss of his brother has affected him greatly, and I feel things could get better. 



I don’t know what to do anymore. Communicating that ""I want to feel like I matter to you"" doesn't do anything. He tells me he cares about me

Background(Me): When I was little my parents were convinced I was autistic because I was borderline mute and obsessed with books.  This has basically been a recurring theme in my life -- barrages of tests, etc. with no clear diagnosis of any learning disability or mental disorder.  I buried myself in computers because they promised logic and order right up to today as a CS major.  In hindsight, I probably did this out of a fear of becoming schizophrenic (which I interpreted as someone with a disorganized brain) because my mom was convinced I would be once since I look somewhat like my schizophrenic aunt.

Background (Family): I have an entire textbook worth of mental illnesses within 1-2 generations on both sides of the family.  Compulsive hoarding, manic depression, and probably a bunch more.  I have lots of stories that seem kind of funny to the rest of the world, but are kind of tragic when you realize they actually happened.  My grandpa never trusted a single sign on the highway because he thought that they were there to intentionally mislead you into taking the long way to your destination and therefore use more gas as part of some government conspiracy.  My grandma would lock me out of the house every time I went to get the mail and I would have to find an open window to get back in.  My dad is so insanely gullible that if you tell him ""Go to the store and buy x brand"" but a salesperson tells him that y brand is better, well he might come home not only with someone you didn't ask for but will recite the sales pitch to you verbatim as if it was an original thought.

Today: I've moved out and this has only made dealing with my family a lot more frightening since I get to see their craziness from a whole different perspective.  This on top of the difficulty of my course load has really weakened my self-confidence in my own sanity and intellectual ability.  I've seen how it affects me firsthand - after a day with my family

I am a terrible people person, or any girl, is the simple fact the she has had a normal social life. 

She has dated, she has experimented with drinking/smoking, she spends all her time with friends and traveling, and experiencing new things like any normal person. I have always wanted this, I have always worked to have a social life like this. I have traveled, I do spend time with friends, I have done stuff that she hasn't

Besides the fact that I have never had a girlfriend or experienced any real intimacy/emotion with another human being, and hoping to find someone like me or more inexperienced. Which I continually learn is a waste of time because as I get older (20 now) the less that is likely to happen. Hell, every 15 year year old I know has experienced those same things that I have yet to, or that I didn't experience until ""adulthood""/after 18.

Now the thing that might be bothering me the most with this specific girl, I did not/do not actively live my life. Shit just happens and I just react to it. Don't get me wrong I am good, even great, at some things, and I'm luckily enough to be really good at what I love doing, but again that is all meaningless without people to share it with. 

People tell me I am really mature for my age and strangers always think I'm older than I am. This makes it even harder to find people that are my level of experience and really embarrassing when they learn how little I know about life/the world.

Here is the situation: I started jacking off to images starting at age 12 and progressing to mild porn before I met my wife (at age 23). After marriage I didn't quit and escalated to online porn videos and occasionally going to strip clubs when out of town on work. I hurt her badly with this; both with actually doing this stuff and with lying to cover it up. Last summer she found my internet history and confronted me on it and I really decided to change based on how much it hurt her. I managed 2 weeks before I was back at it. In December of last year she found me out again and said unless I got help she would have to leave me. Thus began a massive journey for me of cold turkey quitting porn (on /r/pornfree/ and I've made it over 120 days), going to group therapy for sexual addictions, adding constructive hobbies as replacements for porn, playing music for her to sooth her to sleep and doing stress/tension neck releases on her every night. 

I was hoping that stopping this deluge of erotic images would allow me to appreciate my wife's physical appearance better. It didn't. I noticed that I now think I look damn good in the mirror (a first for me) and that her appearance does not bother me anymore (a slight improvement)

Last night she was reading a self help book on healing relationships after sexual addictions and the main point stressed by the authors was honesty. Well after discussing that honesty was critical to an intimate relationship and getting me to promise that I would answer her questions no matter if I hurt her feelings she asked me if I find her physically/visually attractive. I said no. There are many aspects of her body that I love; her sensitive nipples, her long flowing wavy dark hair, her delicately arched feet, her beautiful brown eyes, etc. but I have a problem with her weight. I know this is shallow, I know that I should find her whole body beautiful, I would love it if I did. This revelation, devastated her emotionally. She said that if I truly loved her I would find everything physically about her as beautiful, holding her

In all my past relationships, I guess like attracts like. Looking back, it was nice to have that in common because there was a mutual understanding, and I was comfortable being totally open about my background.

Lately I've been trying to meet people, communication sucks. On the flip side, the guys I meet who are on the same wavelength are usually from much more comfortable backgrounds, if not affluent. It's common sense, I know, and I understand why I see this pattern.

My problem is that I'm intimidated by these guys who are better off--not to be mistaken for being bitter or resentful of their status. It's just that we come from really different worlds, they tend to be more worldly, having travelled to different countries and had all sorts of experiences. That ends up making me feel inferior, and intimidated. While I know I have my own redeeming qualities, I feel like I'm not ""good enough"" to date someone on that tier.

Add to that the fact that I'm not at all used to attractive guys being interested in me [more than casually]. The guys I've dated in the past have been physically ""below my league"" according to everyone (I didn't care, funny, all-around great, from a ""nice"" background, AND attractive, I'm left wondering, ""Why are you even talking to me?"" I'm beginning to think maybe I've settled in the past so I wouldn't have to feel inferior.

I'm fairly confident and happy in my own skin most of the time, even with someone with whom I felt comfortable, insecurities slowly crept up on me and had a pretty negative impact. So if I'm this intimidated just *meeting* a guy, how can I possibly date someone like this without getting totally engulfed by my insecurities?

One way i started branching out was through the internet.  It seemed easier than going out and meeting my old friends, i have actively seeked out friendships/contact with specific people that i have met, and many of them reciprocated. 

So i thought as another step into the direction of facing my anxieties, and consider it a victory if they just responded.  I had known about him for awhile, but only started trying to contact them this month.  I have tried numerous ways of talking to them, of contributing to the fandom, ultimately just to get his attention.  I see him respond to many people that i would say are exhibiting similar desperate habits, but never did he answer me.  It's gotten worse the last couple weeks; I have been messaging them more, sometimes anonymously to see if he would answer me but he did not.  I have started stalking his various social feeds, if he just gave me a chance he would know that!  Then again

Some of my worse symptoms include: that he takes up my focus for most of the day, and tonight i have not been able to fall asleep as i have been thinking of ways of how i can finally send the perfect message that he would respond to.  I have started imagining the worse as well: that he may have gotten the wrong idea about me, or read into my desperation and black-listed me.  That he thinks i am some sort of predator and he black-listed me.  I have been more mad at them than at myself, which in some way is progress since much of my initial problems have stemmed from self-blame.

I’m 18 year old, even though she wasn't. He manipulated me into hating her and her side of the family. But it all blew over when my mom found out that he was manipulating me. There were huge fights, and it angered me that my father had treated me like that. I felt used, and horrible. At one point anger took over me so much that I pushed him out of house, and he ended up living in the car for the whole day. (He came back home the next day.) We all still live together, but my mother and father don’t get along. They don’t even sleep in the same bedroom. I hate the fact that it’s always awkward at home. I hate the fact that we can’t even eat dinner together. My mother has crazy anger problems, and whenever she gets mad, or ever helped me in my life. Nobody has ever encouraged me for anything. I essentially only started studying harder because I wanted to disappear from this hellhole of a life as soon as possible. Therefore for a while my only motivation in life was my education.
I have no place and no one to express my emotion to. Now whenever my emotion gets the best of me. I just wait until night and hug my pillow and play out scenarios like it’s a real person or some shit, depressing reason. I’m also slightly OCD (not professional diagnosis, self diagnosed)

I’m losing all closeness with God, and that next year it would be better for all of us. I’m pretty emotional anyways. I usually cry when in anger rather than fight.

But this winter break (which started a week ago), but I’ve never felt any real connection with them. I have no social life, and no hobbies. But I’ve always wanted to give a hand at acting, or singing. I’m too scared to try though, and don’t know of any opportunities to try my “skill” at so that I can receive feedback.
Christmas was supposed to be spent with family and was supposed to enrich everyone with happiness. (Those Christmas/Disney commercials about having a jolly Christmas didn’t help.) But instead it just depressed me because we just sat at home without any of my extended family, because of my father’s emotional manipulating ways. I know it’s kind of sounds stupid that I can’t trust anyone because every individual is different, but when it comes to trusting anyone with anything, I always hold back. I also had a short (4-5 month) relationship with a girl about 3 years ago, but we broke up after she used me to get to someone else that she found better to date. I also stopped dating because I’m just no longer interested in dating. I’m not an asexual though. I’ve became overweight, but I’ve started working on losing it by running every day. I’ve come to realize that I hate my life, and hate every aspect of it. I’ve been severally depressed over the past few days because of the winter break, and noone to do anything with.

I’m going to college by September of 2013. Hopefully it’s somewhere far away from home, and tell me to deal with it.

So I’m wondering: Am I crazy? Am I just viewing all the events in my life as a big deal? What should I do? How do I also prevent this from affecting me in the future? I don’t want to grow up being depressed or being weird as shit. I’ve always wanted to be normal

So right now, and the other is working in an independently owned game store. I live in an apartment with a roommate. My parents pay for my share of rent, my car, and schooling thought loans while I pay for the rest of my necessities. Mid-way through the year I started dating a girl(f19) who's pretty great. I mean, she's not my usual choice in women but hey, she treats me better than any other girl I've ever had.

Well

Jan. 23 around 11pm I called my other girlfriend(f19) (We'll call here ""M"") to see how she was doing. This girl was the woman of my dreams, when I called her that day, she told me that she had cheated on me the previous night. I was devastated. I drank and got drunk every night for 3 and a half months. I packed her shit out of my place and told her to never talk to me again. That lasted a week. I then asked for her back. She said she need time to think about it and need space. My dumb ass couldn't take that so I'd text her every few days to see how she was and she would just get pissed. Also at some point during all this I attempted suicide and was in a hospital metal ward for a week. I don't remember at what point. It was a very hazy 3.5 months. Anyway. After a month of waiting for her to respond she told me she didn't want to be with me. I broke down and cried. I also slept with one of my friends that night. (The beginning of me becoming a man whore)

So, right? Secretly, I was still a mess and 4 months in, I still missed the girl of my dreams.

After 5 months

I made attempts to date other women

At some point ""M"" contacted me again. I don't know why, but...I knew we weren't. That ate at me. When we talked, she mentioned how she slept with various other guys after me. I was her first. That somehow really hurt me. I cried once I got home. After feel like I was gonna lose my mind, I had her come over to my place one last time to talk about us. I told her I can't take being just her friend. It hurts to much to know she's happy with other guys. She said she still loved me and I told her I loved her. However, she wanted something different than to feel attached to me. I told her I don't want her to feel like she's committed to me, but she couldn't see that. I held her in my arms for what felt like years. I didn't want to let go of the person I loved so much. She wanted badly for us to still be friends or something. She didn't care how fucked up it was, as long as I was still somewhat in her life. I told her I was in a fucked up relationship with a woman I loved before. It didn't work. Finally she gave up. I told her I'd do everything to forget her from this point on and that she should forget me. She said she would never forget me. We hug one last time. I told her she meant nothing to me after that and she left. I didn't even look at her go. I cried for about an hour, got drunk

2 months passed and I did nothing. I didn't go to work. I didn't go to school. I just drank and fucked. I felt like the biggest piece of shit

Things calmed down after I stated dating uh...let's call her ""N."" She's caring and loving to me. I think I love her...but idk. I don't feel about her like I did ""M."" I still have dreams/nightmares about ""M"" almost every day. I long to have her back...but know it's foolish. She cheated on me. She doesn't deserve me

I met John in university when I was dating his friend. John and I had an immediate connection and it very quickly took over what I felt for his friend. We would talk for hours about any and everything. The mental and physical connection we have is indescribeable. Emotionally, we had to learn how to have an orgasm, ie: actively think about and focus until we came. With each other, it was the opposite. We had to fight to not orgasm a minute or so in. We are two sides of the same coin it seemed, our energy was parallel... even intertwined.

Sadly, there is not getting around this fact. He asks me if I believe there are certain people who are meant to be in your life... I do believe that. He asks me what I would do to keep those people in my life. I can see where he is going with this, we never want to stop being in each others lives. We don't want the conversations to end, the advice to stop, and the incredible moments of ecstacy to be lost.

August 2 years ago,who I fell insanely in love with. We were together until May, in a relationship that involved repeated cheating, and even blackmail and me getting hit once. It's difficult to explain how truly fucked up it was that I loved him and thought I couldn't live without him- but, that's what happened. I was on off with him until August, during which time I was dating this other guy- honestly to help me deal with the pain of leaving Jake. I haven't felt as strongly for anyone in the 2 years and a few months since we met.

Then I left the country. I managed to be single for a few months- you'll laugh, so I often have hook ups when I'm single.  I was hooking up with one guy for a few months in my single-ness though, Mustafa. Mustafa had a rough sex fetish, I used to come home with half my body blue and black. Never my face though, except for once on my lip. I really enjoyed that, which also feels fucked up. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I'm putting it in here because it feels important. Anyway

Then I met this new guy Joaquin, my best friend has a big problem with it. Once we were in bed, and I told him I really didn't want sex without a condom. He kept asking. Then he just put it in anyway. When I yelled at him he took it out. 

Then I went backpacking, which pissed me off. Obviously that's over. 

So I came home, it's unbelievable.) We've been hooking up for a month and I was debating whether or not to make it serious. He's a nice person, as far as I can tell. Me and some friends ran into him at a bar a few nights ago, and he was beyond trashed, and it was kind of embarrassing. I now feel like I want to keep him for sure as only a hook up. I guess I don't think someone who's 35 should be acting the way he usually does, at least not the kind of person I'd want a relationship with. 


So. If someone could tell me what's wrong with me, I wouldn't always find the men that I do AND STAY WITH THEM. I'd like to have a long term relationship with someone kind, and that I love and he loves me and all. It will sound so simple to all of you. ""If you find a guy that's a douchebag, leave him."" But I can't. I get this feeling like I can't live without them, and the pain is overwhelming. There is something seriously wrong, and I don't know how to fix it. 

TL;DR I always wind up with terrible men (with the exception of the most recent one)

Anyways, or at all, before we initially hookup and begin ""seeing eachother"".  Then we will talk/text a lot and usually hangout very frequently, anywhere from twice a week to every day.  Everything will seem to be going fine, and sometimes at the beginning I will try my best to not ""like"" her very much in fear of getting attached.  (I seem to always be over attached).  Initially she may even contact me a lot more than I contact her, and she will appear to like me a lot more.  

The fucking second I decide beyond reasonable doubt that I do like her, I start reconsidering if I can do better!

After this happens, constantly thinking about her.  It will eventually dwindle down and they will completely stop talking to me, or I will fucking EXPLODE and pour my feelings out to them like an emotional bitch and this will push them away further.

I essentially ignored my brother for anything other than what he found was funny on the internet or something.  If it was anything else I'd just move myself out and not interact again.

I'm frustrated. I can't seem to solidify an emotional connection to anyone and I have NO idea why. I am not currently seeing a therapist and think it would be good if I did, of opening up even to that individual.

I've been on many dates over the last year, but that's not, ultimately, what I'm going after. I'm afraid though that it seems to women that IS the only thing I'm looking for. I've only had one sexual partner and it was a 2 night stand back in college, before any of these dates. When I say I ended up in beds, we were just fooling around, never any sex. Due to the fact that my sex drive is very high

That's just what I feel though

I also find it incredibly difficult to open up emotionally to people. There's a nagging barrier deep within my ""feelings matrix"" (located roughly in my solar plexus - just a silly name to describe those ""gut feelings"" that you get when you're sad, etc.) that I imagine is some form of anxiety.

The last thing that bugs me is that I don't feel like I could comfortably be physically close to a woman until i'm down to a ""normal"" size. I guess the easiest way to hash that is that I'm very self conscious of my weight. When I've been physically intimate with women

Simply, and I'm afraid that I won't ever manage to get there.

Some important notes from my past and my current situation that may help with responses:

* Overweight
* Father passed away when I was 11 which means I was raised exclusively by my mother. The closest good father figure I had in my life lived over 1000 miles away.
* Being raised Christian
* I often get chastised by friends saying that I'm very blunt and abrasive
* I don't know as that I've ever had someone that felt love toward except my parents and my siblings.
* I'm not particularly ugly
* Most of my friends have been verbally abusive, and often call me fag, queerbait, dumbass, thick, dumb etc. ""Find new friends"" is the common solution, however I've only lived in this city for 1 year and have found it difficult to meet people outside of okcupid dates and work.
* I have a condition called [low latent inhibition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_inhibition#Low_latent_inhibition)

Any advice would be wonderful. If anyone is willing to PM me and become an online friend

EDIT: Edited to add that my roommate/housemate is very aggressive and is the one who mostly calls me names like queerbait and fag.

EDIT2: Hopefully last edit - forgot to mention that I've been told multiple times by reddit and by friends that I get clingy really fast. I don't know why this is, but it just happens. This is all internal, by the way. I don't share that clinginess to the individual I feel attracted to or directly to my friends/coworkers, but friends and coworkers often notice it, and I can't imagine most women would miss it, though I don't have my face to face time with them after the first date.",,,,

I've been in a bit of a rut for about a year now and I can't seem to get myself out of it

- It all started when my ex boyfriend broke up with me. I put every ounce of myself into that relationship

- He took advantage of me and would rarely ever recognize how much I cared for him. 

- This fucked me up emotionally. I haven't been able to get back to being the extremely sweet

- People still do consider me to be a very sweet girl

- I did attempt to start dating again

- I always wound up in the same situation: they don't like me. I never truly was upset because I never had immense feelings for them either

- I also lost all my of friends due to a falling out between my best friend and my old group of friends. I rarely go out anymore and I currently gave up on dating

I'm not fine. I cry myself to sleep probably every night. I've never been a jealous person; but now i've began to hate everyone who has what I want. I've become so selfish.

I don't know if this is a phase or if I need to seek therapy. I never had luck with friendships and relationships. I tend to date and surround myself around people who are extremely selfish and no good for me. I always am the one who gets burned in the end. I know I need to put a stop to it.

I'm not sure where to post this


I’m not sure if I have an abnormal way of going about relationships

**Background:**

My early childhood was pretty good

**Problem:**

I have a hard time fully connecting to the girls that I meet. I met my first girlfriend when I was about 18 and it was a wonderful experience for me. I, but I could not say the same back. I figured that it was not exactly fair for her and I needed to sort some problems out for myself…so I left her.

A year later I met my second girlfriend. We stayed together for 2 years and meeting her was one of the best things that ever happened to me. While going out with her

She later left me when she graduated. I changed my major so I had to stay for another few years

Another issue that she brought up when she was breaking up with me was that I never said “I Love You” to her. It made her feel like trash and that I never truly cared about her. I did deeply care about her

** **
**Question**  
It’s been a few months since my second girlfriend. I've been going out more and I have slept with a few girls since.  
  
Now, hurting? I am at a loss for words to describe it.

I don’t know what I want from her

I'm sorry that I cannot be more articulate on the subject or with my question. I just feel......lost.

As of late

To show you the extent of what has happened, got piercings in quite a few illegal places for my age/country, slept around with a friends with benefits and was happy to live life as a nudist. Yes, I do understand I was younger then and I must accept myself to change with age, but it's more than that.

When getting with my boyfriend he was very uncomfortable with nudity or with my open sexuality, stayed truthful to him (not like I never believed in fidelity), and even removed my piercings. Slowly and eventually he started to challenge my beliefs in nudity, my spirituality and to make me feel bad every time I went out, even if it was for lunch with my sister. After a while I snapped and told him off about it, and he did stop acting that way, however, but ever since I have been jealous of him being around other girls. Not to mention that he acts like a dick in public (really flirty

I try to be supportive of him

The groups that he joins also bother me in that they seem fanatical. Everyone else we know can see it besides him

I have become almost mothering to him because of my irritability

He has lied to me in past

I always had this perception in the back of my mind that men didn't want serious relationships. They didn't want to get married. They didn't want girlfriends. 

I see men and women getting into relationships all the time

It's only recently occurred to me after being single for some time, families, those sort of things and maybe I've been looking at everything all wrong and men aren't all that stereotypical DB a girl has to lasso and hogtie to keep around. To be honest, I've always been quite lax in my relationships so I felt that this was the reason I hadn't settled down.

However

One man who I've known for many years, and a few weeks later, he changed the facebook status--yep--he was seeing someone. They broke up a few months later, and when he spoke to me again in a tone I felt familiar to prior, I felt comfortable confronting him by telling him that his actions hurt me and why. He was very nice and told me he just thought I was that kind of girl. I told him I wasn't and he promised he wouldn't try anything again. And that itself stung too.

I tried a more traditional girl route with my next date, and we were clicking well, he stopped speaking to me. When I finally decided there was a problem and he wasn't just busy, I asked him about it, he told me that he just didn't want a relationship right now and he felt I might be pushing one.

Go figure.

Me as a young boy:  Living in a pretty standard neighborhood, would go out and play sports, bike, etc.  Normal.

At some point, and we got along dandy.  At some point, and I'm not sure how it began, we started 'experimenting' with one another.  Showing each other what we had, touching (nothing 'sexual', as we didn't know enough about what to do), maybe getting a little under dressed and wrestling.  We definitely knew it was 'not right' according to what our parents would think, would get horny

Eventually, I would still pursue these actions, and he would be uninterested.  Our relationship trailed off, we stopped talking.

After that happened, eventually began 'experimenting'.  Eventually the other boy became uninterested, stopped responding to my continued interest.  A repeat of the first case.

The same thing happened with another boy.  This time, my father took me aside and had a 'birds and the bees' talk, chalking up my actions with another boy to be 'curiosity'.

After this

End neighborhood relationships

Beginning elementary school, all that good stuff.  
Around grade 3 I developed a 'best friend' relationship with another boy.  This boy was popular, do lots of things together, etc.  At one point we had a sleepover.  During this, I made advances similar to what I did at a slightly younger age.  The boy was uninterested, was disgusted, and we stopped being friends.  For whatever reason, after this, or because my personality changed.  I became quiet

The sort of personality stayed with my throughout the rest of grade school.  I was withdrawn and quiet

Flash forward to today.  I am a 23 y/o male, very interested in science.  I have not been in a relationship or had sex in 2+ years (and that was with a girl).  One of my few friends is a 19 y/o male. 

I have been attracted to this 19 y/o male for several years (while we were attending the same university).  After I graduated, and I found that my feelings for him are just as strong, if not stronger.

It is not just a sexual interest.  He is smart and funny.  I enjoy being around him, have the same thoughts as he has them (at which point we look at each other and crack up, while no one else seems to get the joke).  I also find him sexually attractive.  Slim athletic build, pretty facial features.  You get the idea.  

Despite my truly powerful desire to confess my feelings and hope so hard that he is either interested or not so disgusted that he shuns me henceforth

Alone-&gt; Found a friend-&gt;Became attracted to him-&gt;Showed sign of feelings-&gt;Friend does not share feelings

You see
I wonder if this is not some self-destructive habit destined to leave me alone and miserable. 
I wonder if I am not just very horny because I have not had sex in so long. 
I'd like answers.  I'd settle for opinions.

I've dated a few people and have known a lot more and never have I felt this way with anyone. except theres this one guy that it feels like all he has to do is look me in the eye and I'm safe, and I've felt this way the entire time I've known him. Every conversation is stimulating and so outstanding and all I can think about is wanting to spend every second just talking to him and being with him. Neither of us have made a move yet and thats not really my question, but I have no doubts in my mind that it would be an incredible/passionate relationship if it ever became one.

But do you think everyone is capable of finding passionate, electrifying, gravity-defying love? I know it's hard to come by, but it's not impossible. I know it takes time but is it really that crazy to want that, and does it last? I don't see the point in settling for anything less than that, does anyone else agree? And is it worth risking a great friendship over or is it best to keep it going from a distance to just be able to keep it as it is?

I'm sure this sounds like nonsense

I know tons of you will be laughing at this and saying ""like that will ever happen"" but that was somehow what has always been in my head as the perfect proposal.

So here's the problem I am super jealous of my bf's brother and gf (well, Sea World, etc.). They invited me to go with them but I declined because I knew my dad was really looking forward to me being home and he's had such a crappy year and it would probably crush him if I decided to not spend the time with him. So yesterday, they all went to the Magic Kingdom at Disney and guess what?!?! My bf's brother proposed to his gf in the exact way as my perfect proposal. And as if that wasn't enough, the ring he got her is the same setting as my favorite.

So now here I am when all I should be is happy for them I'm thinking about myself and how I can never have my perfect proposal. And it makes me feel like such a horrible person. How do I get past this so that I will be happy with whatever proposal I get and so that I can just be happy for my bf's brother? 

**TL/DR**: My bf's brother just proposed to his gf in the exact way that I have always dreamed of with my favorite ring and I'm super jealous. How do I stop being such a selfish bitch?

**Background Info**: Bf and I have been dating for a little over 6 years now. Bf knows all of these things that I like so it would actually be possible for him to think of this proposal on his own. He also knows how much I have thought about what the perfect proposal would be for me and he knew that I had some high expectations (thankfully that didn't scare him away).

That's a whole 'nother story. The only sex I've had since then is with one guy. We briefly had a casual relationship (no commitment, that kind of stuff) then he stopped calling me. Months later

While we have a lot of fun and the chemistry is insane, he's perfect. I like where we are. The problem is, I'm so lonely and sexually frustrated, that I sort of project all of these feelings onto him. I think about him all the time. When the possibility of seeing him comes up, I get way too excited (and often disappointed, when it doesn't end up happening). It's not him I'm obsessed with per say, but the idea of intimacy that he represents. He's the only guy that I've ever really felt comfortable and enjoyed sex with, etc. I've built up this idea of him in my head that isn't what he really is. This probably has a lot to do with my anxiety disorder. I obsess and over analyze every little thing in my life. 

My friends think I'm torturing myself and I should cut him off. It's the obvious answer- when one person feels more strongly than the other in a FWB situation, but they just get extremely cloudy and distorted when I feel lonely and want a man around (which is more often than not). The hardest part is that nothing will change if I stop seeing him, I'll still think about him all the time, I'll just be kicking myself for not sleeping with him when I had the chance. And of course, let's be honest, when you haven't had sex in 4 months and there's no other prospects on the horizon, its pretty damn hard to turn it down.

So I'm gonna start this with the following statement: I'm a sleepwalker. My parents noticed it when I was young, and my sleep schedule got totally thrown out of whack and I start to really sleep walk again, which has sort of ruled out late-night excursions and follow-up walk of shames for fear that I injure myself or somebody else (I've actually attempted to go to parties while asleep).

As part 2 of the background, but now I'm pretty well over her and I've gotten serious with the girl that was one of the ""rebounders,"" but I made a mistake. After some fun one night I fell asleep with her at her room, and apparently she had sex with me while I was asleep (which because I'm a sleep walker is apparently very possible... it's called sexsomnia).

Normally I'd be fine with this sort of thing, and I've tried talking to her about it but she's very evasive. I care about this girl a lot, and I really don't want to break it just because she likes things to be kinky (and is kind of leaving me out... it actually feels remarkably like she's cheating on me, she refers to me being asleep as ""dream-you"").

So what should I do? I can't seem to talk to her

**Female, giving, loving, optimistic and compassionate person with a lot to give. I'm strong, determined, confident and independent (most of the time :-p). I'm curious, intelligent, can be funny (apparently)




I welcome a challenge and I’m willing to push my own boundaries to overcome fears and achieve things that perhaps once seemed overwhelming to me. I consider myself to be open-minded, I sketch nudes and I write. I like to help others whenever possible, to organise/promote/run community and fundraising events, volunteer where I can, take in stray/wild animals that need help, and I foster babies in need of love. I have two teen boys of my own (14 &amp; 19) and at the moment I’m fostering a beautiful 6 month old baby boy (born 7 weeks premature, drug addicted). I have a wonderful group of friends and I’m always there for any of them if they need anything




**I grew up with an emotionally and physically abusive brother, second when I was 23 in a marriage that fell apart 2 years later, after post natal depression. As a single mum I found my strength again, found new passions and perspectives, and homeschooled my boys for a few years; my youngest had speech and learning challenges (he is now 14 and flying aeroplanes in a high school Aviation program and at Air Force Cadets). At 29 my kidneys began to fail. I went on dialysis and at 32 with only weeks left I received a double transplant (kidney &amp; pancreas). So I’ve dealt with a few things in my life thus far, all of which I believe have made me a stronger woman.**




February 2010 I fell in love with a wonderful man (both 35 at that time). What we felt for each other neither of us had felt for anyone else before. We made a commitment to each other, the chemistry, the depths we went to together, the love – it was extraordinary.




**But it wasn’t so simple; I lost his baby (miscarriage) early in our relationship (we didn’t even know we were pregnant), after a botched birth control implement I bled for almost 3 months straight, in regular pain, taking hormone treatments on top of my transplant meds (steroids etc), became severely anaemic, had blood transfusions that threatened my transplant, all ending in a hysterectomy. My ex wanted more children; I felt like I had failed him in a HUGE way. I already felt insecure about my transplant going into the relationship; could anyone love me, but now there were added insecurities and failures to deal with. He assured me he loved me, and trusted him.**




Through all the health concerns and stresses I was not able to do the things I was passionate about in life, to acknowledge him, to give to our relationship, I lost myself...completely it now appears. I became insecure, somewhat needy, and quite sensitive/emotional (crying lots). Neither my ex nor I knew how to deal with this. Other things happened in that time that I feel exacerbated my fears and my ex admitted to not being the reassuring type. Things spiralled out of control from there. A year after we met he ended our relationship.




**We kept seeing each other casually until around 5 weeks ago. Although I’ve been getting some professional help for my insecurities etc for some time now, the ‘casual’ aspect drove me a tad crazy in the end. We did everything a couple would do, minus the commitment on his behalf.** 




Although I fully accept my ex for who he is, his fascination with sex/other people’s sex life, his need for 2-3 hours alone time a day (quite introvert), the type of interactions he has with other women (seems to need a certain amount of attention from other women), his defensive behaviours. Not one to stray away from a challenge, and REALLY wanting to understand him so completely, I tried to learn all I could about him, blogs, appreciate and even enjoy all these quirks about him and his personality needs. 




**During our ‘casual’ time he was on a dating site that progressed to him flirting with and pursuing dates with other women. Due partly to the lack of commitment between us now, not shy in expressing myself, keen to please...I regrettably began to feel sexually inadequate as time went on.**




We would often fantasise about threesomes together. On April Fool’s Day (still in casual time) I told him I had slept with two women the night before. He became very aroused so I kept the story going for the morning. We laughed about it after and he told me to feel free to spin such stories in future, to leave him guessing as that was even more of a turn on.




**A few weeks later, he couldn’t get enough of me. He was all over me, SO attentive sexually – I LOVED it. It was what I had been craving from him. Suddenly I became more interesting to him sexually again. He was curious about ME again, and so passionate. I kept the story going for a few months as it felt so amazing to have his sexual attention the way he was giving it to me. Then he started feeling uncomfortable with it; we had spoken about him joining in, but of course he couldn’t, it was a ‘story’...though it had even begun to feel real to me. I eased off and wanted to tell him that none of it was real, but it had bought us so close; he was telling me he loved me again, we were opening about our sexual fantasies and desires in so much more depth,just FWB. I was hurt and felt confused.** 




That night I went home and created an account on OKC pretending to be someone else to see what his profile/activity was. I contacted him (I know, I rarely ever get angry or express my anger if I am, but I got nasty with him through this fake profile. Over the following days, he knew something was wrong. He knew I wasn’t being honest. I was a wreck by this time, so far beneath the woman I knew myself to be. I confessed it ALL to him in the end. 




**Four days after the confession he again professed his love for me, but by the fact that I did he knew he wanted to be with me. I told him I couldn’t do casual with him anymore as it was driving me crazy. He said he didn’t want to; he wanted to be in a committed relationship with me again. That changed a week later after a misunderstanding and me reminding him I couldn't do casual, regrettably via an ultimatum. We were on-again-off-again like this for some time.**




One of the attributes I didn’t include in my description above of who I am as a person was honest. My ex once said I was the most honest and open person he had ever met. My friends know me to be that person. I prided myself on being that person. But now, which I didn’t feel he needed to know. The other I used to comment on one of his comments to a post, pretending to be someone else in the hope he would understand my feelings and perspective on a situation.  




**I’ve messed up! I’ve become a dishonest person :-(**




I went to a wedding recently. Apart from the bride; a beautiful friend of mine, what I have achieved despite my challenges, my community work, fostering, how I’ve raised my gorgeous boys, and the kind of friend I had been to the bride. I was astonished at how many times I was greeted that way by wonderful people; kind, generous people that all held respectful and admirable roles in the community. EVERY time they complimented me I felt like I was going to vomit; all I could think was how I had lied to the man I love, not wanting anymore attention, gave him a hug then soon after exited the reception with a bottle of wine. Sitting beside the nearby water




TL;DR: **My ex and I had something incredibly beautiful, to him or to me. Due to circumstances and insecurities that arose I strayed from who I know myself to be. I lied. Furthermore, I became weak; I cried on my ex’s doorstep begging him to talk to me, to understand me, for months I chased him and tried to fix everything – except myself, it seems. All of this seems to overshadow any good there was, any beauty inside I do have; he can’t see it anymore





**He hates me for who I have become and won't forgive me, I hate myself for who I’ve become, for what I allowed myself to be reduced to, and I don’t know how to forgive myself. I feel flawed in the deepest sense.** 





**I thought I was a good person. What now? Do I ever get to be that person again?**

As my throwaway username suggests

Basically my situation is that I want every person I date to fall in love with me. And so far I've pretty much succeeded. The other aspect about this is that I've never been in love myself. I want to fall in love so badly.  

Through my insecure persona (because I've worried so much about what people think of me)

I do realise I have some sort of an attachment disorder, I'm thinking ""oh gosh, they're going to think I'm a total bitch"" and ""how can I make this all sounds less fucked up than it is, because I don't want them to think I'm a bitch"". This is how my mind works...  

I don't want any pity-points

I used to be insecure, hated the way I look, thought everything I said was stupid etc... Once I worked through those issues, I actually know my worth now and all that has somehow turned into a bloated ego that needs to be rubbed.

Something happened when I was younger and I don't know what to think or make of it. I've never told anyone about this because I'm not sure how people would react. They may think I'm crazy. I think I'm crazy. I change my mind all the time. I don't know what to think.

I'm shaking even thinking about posting this. It's like my big moment of truth

Warning; some graphic description. May make some readers uncomfortable.

I'm a 19 year old female who grew up in a stable family; mum and dad, my siblings and I would visit with family members, sometimes staying up to two or three nights in different houses. It was fun to visit and be treated. This lasted throughout our childhood, until we were around 12/13.

When I was 11, in bed, and asked me to, ""Come and give him a cuddle."" I walked around to face him and he lifted the blankets, motioning for me to get in. I did, facing him, and he hugged me for a while. He then started to tickle me, and I squirmed and told him to stop. I hated being tickled, under my shirt, but couldn't manage it lying on my side

I still don't know what to think. Technically, he can't of accidently unhooked my bra.

He would ask often for me, I went to stay with him alone for a long weekend to help him clean his house. I decided that I had blown what had happened out of proportion and needed to get over it. By this time I was 15/16. One night as we were getting up to go to bed, he pressed me against a wall and tickled my neck by nuzzling me. I couldn't get away because he had my wrists pinned to the wall next to my face and I could feel his crotch pushed up against mine. He was laughing and I was nervously laughing too. I was terrified but he seemed as though it was a joke. I didn't want to let him know I was scared if he didn't think anything was wrong. He whispered good night and kissed my neck, let me go, and went to bed. I lay awake all night again. I haven't stayed with him since.

I feel dirty and horrible and like the worst person alive for even having these thoughts about this person. I think that he really thinks there's nothing wrong and that it's all in my head. I'm sick. I'm sick to think this about a family member. I feel like I created something out of nothing. I think about these events every day. They have affected how I am around people. I am very closed up and don't form close bonds. I've never had a boyfriend up until recently. He knows that something happened, because I think about this man breathing down my neck, or his smell, or his sweat from that night when I was 11 years old. I'm messed up. This has bothered me for eight long years. It may bother me forever.

Recently, have caused me to lose interest in life completely. I'm not suicidal - I would never kill myself. I just don't see a point to anything. Nothing gives me pleasure, there's nothing to look forward to. I don't see anything in the future. I sit at home all day, I don't have the drive to get a job, I cry every night and just feel sad all the time. I think that dying would be better than being alive. I know this sounds suicidal but I don't want to kill myself, I just want to be dead... if that makes sense? My boyfriend asked if I am depressed and to me, that just sounds ridiculous and selfish. I really have no reason to be depressed. I feel like it's my fault that I'm this way and if I had depression, I have no real reason to be depressed. I just... don't want to do anything. I just want to sleep... forever. That's the only way I can describe it.

So yes, horrible human with nasty thoughts? Or did something really happen?

I wish I could do a TL;DR

I would stay on the phone for hours on end trying to make her situation better, and did everything I could for her.  Drove the 6 hrs it took to get there, met her family, she hasn't visited me at my home (I'm now out of college), but simply a lifeline to use when things get bad.

The other situation is similar, she says yes, but then ""sleeps through her alarm"" and woke up too late for lunch.  Yet, it seems that if she really wants to do something, she makes it a priority.

A bit about me first:  I've been in one relationship that lasted all of two months a few years ago and that was the most 'successful' relationship I've been in.  I used to be really fat and unattractive.  I also battled with depression throughout my teenage years.  I got into cycling a few years ago, i exercise regularly now, and eat healthy for the most part.  I also grew up a lot since then.  I have seriously self esteem issues though, as I don't feel like I'm worthy of dating most of the time.  Probably due to my lack of success, prior body image issues, and being raised without a father figure in an asian home (my family was not very affectionate). 
These days I feel a lot better about myself but it's hard for me to see any positive aspect when I look at myself.  

Flashforward to the past few months.  Met a girl online on a dating site

We've only hung out for a weekend and I know I shouldn't be this irrational about a stupid dating profile being reactivated.  My logical brain is telling me that I should not be emotional about this, ""this relationship isn't going anywhere"", ""you're useless"" etc.  

I feel like I put a lot of stock in being in a relationship, which I do, but right now I'm out of school for the summer, working part time, and have a lot of free time.  Free time to think about my relationships and this girl, along with my issues.

I was 14 or 15 and went to the house of a friend of a friend to jam out with some of his friends that I hadn't met. One of his buddies brought his little sister along, she was in 8th grade. I immediately was drawn to her. She was adorable and very friendly. I couldn't wait to see her again after that night. I would get butterflies and get nervous anytime I would hear that her brother was going to be around in hopes that she would be there. Her brother and I became really good friends and were in several bands together over the next few years. I fell in love with her quickly, my mutual buddy knew it and he always talked me up around her. Word got around and her brother knew as well, and we would joke about it. I never had the balls to tell her even though I would bring her flowers occasionally, and would go ot of my way for her. She was a small time model. She was gorgeous. Me, an overweight not even close model. Bad self esteem. Her older bro left for college and I would still see her around. Always greeted with excitement and a huge hug. She always made me feel better about myself. She fronted a band and I was asked to fill in on occasion. We became good friends, because of how gorgeous she was AND she was in a band, as a game. We would try to catch the other off guard. Go to the beach together and I would run the douche bags off who would annoy her. I would come to her and her roomates' place to be greeted by them both in their underwear jumping on me with a stradling hug they both seemed overjoyed to see me.

I don't see any common symptoms present in me that are often associated with being interested in someone , I find it vary easy to spot her in the crowd.

Fortunately this girl is a friend of a friend of mine, which I attend fore sole reason to get to know her better, but sadly results have been insignificant due to my social inadequacy and lack of communication skills.

Although direct stalking is unacceptable on my part

I figure my biggest problem is that I'm a vary cynical person and don't believe in ""unconditional love""

I understand that my chances of entering in a relationship with this girl are virtually impossible. Its just something I'd like to figure out for myself and decide my next course of actions.

Ohhh man I fucked up bad this time. Sorry if this turns into a rant

OK, but overall I think we have a good relationship, and I love him lots.

Recently he's been feeling depressed, and ended up telling me that he doesn't trust me anymore, and that he feels he can't talk to me about anything, especially not his problems, because he doesn't think I care about him at all, and that I just want to use him.
 He has helped me heaps with my problems in the past  and now thinks I am just with him so he can solve my problems.

His arguments are this. I used to get jealous when he spoke to this one girl, he would always take an almost hour long bus back with her to walk her home when we went out in groups (and he'd tell me not to bother going with them), he'd basically just do so much for her. So yes, I admit, I got jealous. But I got to realise that that is how he speaks to girls, and he'd do it for anyone. But now he thinks I will get like this with any girl he talks to and so tells me he feels depressed when he talks to girls because he thinks I will get angry.

On that note, he spends his time telling me sorry. Even though I give no indication of being angry... because I'm not!

I did try to get him to open up to me, but he never would. And now I'm afraid it's too late, he doesn't trust me and our relationship is doomed to fail. Oh and we also just signed a one year lease on a flat, so I'm afraid he's feeling that pressure too...

I don't understand, so he didn't have to say that at all. Why would you want to marry someone you don't trust?

I need help. How can I show him that I care about him, if he won't talk to me?

One last thing. The thing that sparked this if recently is this. Tuesday was the last day teaching the class he's been following for years and has grown to really like. I knew that was soon, was: ""yes but I am a mind reader, I know when you are sad and when stuff happens to you, so I expect everyone to be the same"". 

 I realise I have been quite selfish recently, but not all.

Sorry for the uber long text... I need help. I have no one to talk to that is not a ""shared"" friend with my boyfriend.

A sexual relationship evolved and he enjoys being with me in other ways as well

I have tried and failed to make a long story short.

I was with my ex boyfriend for 3 years, I took language classes, created an income from tutoring english and maintaining it by living minimally, made new friends...I invested time, effort, and emotion.  

We broke up after he had admitted to cheating on me during a trip to Cuba.  This happened two months ago

I disappeared for two days but came back after deep reflection and tried to understand his point of view and why he had cheated.  I forgave him (though he wasn’t sorry).  We made a list of things we could do to build the relationship

Mine and my ex’s plan for a long time had been to register as a domestic partnership, but isn't my passion, so I’ll be going home to pursue an internship and get a few job hookups...see my family and friends...speak english.  But all with the hopes that I can learn some skills in the States and come back over the pond for some applicaton.

We had solidified this plan a week before we broke up.  I asked him

We broke up a week later, singing “distance!”

I can’t believe I was ever with this clown.

I move to the couch downstairs and we frustratedly ignored each other for a week until one day

I told him that we both know we don’t want to be with the other.  He deceived me in regards to the domestic partnership.  I will leave in very poor form this country which I had come to love. 

Despite my frustration with him

And luckily, sexually speaking...and also he was a good support system emotionally, telling me that he respected me for having a good head on my shoulders throughout this debacle.  

Nonetheless

The next weekend, me, my (F) roommate, and buddy ended up back at his apartment.  I don't remember the specifics of the conversation there, but in my drunken ramblings I was complaining about being squeezed out of a domestic partnership and how betrayed I felt.  The buddy apparently offered up his little brother to me.  That ngiht we slept like sardines on the bed.

The next morning I woke up and left them to have some alone time

A week later my ex upsets me for shitting all over an idea I had about my next move in life, and reemerged, heavy hearted and confiding in my (F) roommate about my state of my affairs.  She holds me and tries to cheer me up by jokingly reminding me that buddy had offered up his little brother.  In the heat of desperation I said something along the lines of, ""Oh, yeah, I should really get his number"".

Apparently sometime after this meeting, somewhere in that genre of pity.

A week or two later, cleaned, etc, though we had invited no one.  The insignificant 5th roommate in the house, who invited 50 people, twiddles his thumbs and watches us work.  My ex, who invited plenty of people, belligerent drunks.  It was a fucking mess

In the middle of this bordelique shitfest, and worth it so that I can stay.  I can barely hear him, and he's fairly soft-spoken, so I say, ""Yeah, I should look up your little brother""

He looks at me confused and says, I'm not looking anyway, and it's just a matter of paperwork.  I can help you out.""

My eyes lit up and it was like I was really looking at him for the first time.  It is such a kind gesture and in that moment I realized what an incredibly nice man he is.  But I ask him anyway

He assures me that it has nothing to do with that.  And I believe him.  I ask if he's any longer with my (F) roommate and he says

The incompetent party continues but I am running around

Everybody finally passes out.  The sun is up.  Buddy gets next to me in bed and gently puts his hand on my hip.  The next morning we wake up and he takes my arm and puts it under his head and cuddles me.  As this is happening, that things indeed must have cooled between them.

Fast forward a few days later.  I'm in the town and my oldest friend blows me off.  I sent off a text to the buddy asking if we can grab a beer and talk about this domestic partnership thing.

We meet up and he gets the first round, “Are we going to mine?”.  I sit on the handlebars of my bike as he pedals and sings in my ear.  

We make love, he remembers what I say in conversation and quotes me.  We laugh a lot and have a great time.  He loves to be held, and his head is often on my bosom.  We both feel good.  

We’re in bed when he asks what should we say to the people around us about us?  We agree to say nothing.  We just want to give it a try

That plan blows up pretty quickly due to the fact that I live with my (M) roommate and (F) roommate.  They put 2 and 2 together pretty quickly, “Oh...who’s the dame?”, and they became suspicious when he was tepid on the subject.

Being exposed in the way we were made us cringe; we hadn’t acted like adults and and we felt bad.  I really love my (F) roommate and never meant to hurt her.  She was upset that I had taken her for an idiot.  I apologized as best as I could.

With that dose of guilt sloppily resolved

I texted him back, and railing on about how there are so many men in this city, why did I have to sleep with his friend?  He then irrelevantly spiraled off and unearthed a whole recap of the failures in our relationship.  I asked him if I stopped seeing his buddy, would he go back to being friends with him?  He said he didn’t know and pedaled away to a party of his friends, the same group of college kids he knows his buddy through.  They didn’t talk much at the shindig, but the impression was clearly that my ex wanted some distance from him.  My ex then chugged a beer and left the party.  

The last functioning drunk at the party approaches the buddy and says something like

The next morning, either.  Things escalate and he puts his hands on me, which I never in a million years thought he would do.  I saw him handle being ripped off by his old roommates with admirable grace, and I thought he was always so emotionally controlled.  Not this, he was really upset.

That night, that my ex is perhaps mad about me having sex in general (as per his response to finding out I had slept with my oldest friend) and that if we stop seeing each other now then all this shit we stirred up will have been for nothing.  We’re kissing all the meanwhile but anyway he says, he needs some time to think about it.

The next day he sends me a text saying he thinks we shouldn’t see each other anymore.  It being a textual conversation

The day after that

The day after I sent the buddy a text asking about some papers for the partnership, and also that all my ex is asking for is some distance, he doesn’t want to know or care what we do, and he’s much more at peace now.  In fact, that very night my ex had brought over a girl to the house to cook dinner for, and I was counting on buddy to hang out with me a little while so I didn’t have to go back early.  He happily obliged to play billiards with me so I don’t go home prematurely, and we make our way over to a hall.

On the way over, betted on a couple of sexual favors, and headed back to his place.

The next night

I was worried so I sent a message to buddy

Saturday comes and he approaches me in the park with a crisp “Hey lady” and kisses me on the mouth.  He tells me that he feels bad about what happened with my ex and his friends (he thinks his other friends have lost trust in him), and we went back to his and made love.  We both had plans that night so we parted ways, with plans to see him play tennis with his little brother the day after.

Well, ‘take care’ and signing his name...I knew something was off.  

I waited three days and then I called him.  I was in town and wanted to know if I could stop over.  He said yes.  I go over and he tells me he talked with another friend, tired of making the same argument, and basically just call him a loser.  He says, “Fuck you.”  I say, “Yeah, fuck me”.  He did.

We had a great time as usual, but someone not from his friend group who can shed some unbiased opinions.  I wanted him to hold on to the partnership agreement, because I already spent more money, more time, and more effort reloading the process.  Most importantly, it’s obvious that this partnership was the birth of our relationship, so if we broke that off then we really went through a whole bunch of social awkwardness

This is where he currently is: in the countryside, writing this.  He told me don’t fret about it, that I should have a good weekend.  I can’t.  

I need some advice.  I don’t know if I’m in the right.  Things are resolved with him and my (F) roommate; in fact, and I believe that my ex’s behavior towards me predicts that one day in the future my ex and his buddy will be able to put it behind them.

I would let him go, and I want to fight for that, and convince him if I can that it’s okay for us to see each other.  I hope this isn’t wishful thinking.  I know I can’t control the thoughts or actions of others but is there something I can do to help my desires be realized?

Thanks for tuning in.

So she's been now dating Mark for 6 months or so. Dad has gotten little better with his alcohol problem, and bad drunk since he gets violent. He lies to mom all the time and breaks her stuff and steals her car keys, driver's licence, what ever he feels like will keep mom around him. Mom has countless of times ""gotten sick with him"" and went to home for a sanctuary, only to be back at his place the next day. During her brief stays at home she and my dad get drunk again and start fighting, dad calling her a whore etc etc. She always promises she'll never go back to Mark, but she always breaks her promise (because she says she loves Mark). I have lost all faith in my mother and feel that I can't trust her anymore... I'm even thinking about uninviting her to my upcoming wedding to avoid the disappointment of not having her there (I doubt Mark would let her to come since my dad will be there).

I don't understand why mom decides to stay with Mark; he is clearly using her for her money (since Mark is unemployed - but mom only makes about 1, she just says ""I'll tell you when you're older""). I'm sad that I have lost my mother, she haven't listened to me and my brother when we have stated our concerns about her dating. 
  Is there anything me and my brother could do to make her realize that being with Mark is the biggest mistake of her life? Any advice from people who have been in the same kind of situation as my mom? What has made you to stop dating the wrong man that you have loved?

I'm a 24 year old male. Last night my girlfriend and I had an argument about what she calls my ""anti-social attitude."" I looked up what this term actually means on the internet, or caring about what's going on with other people. In fact, it's because someone else asked me to. I never feel the need or desire to ask someone to hang out with me. I hardly ever feel lonely though. It's just not something that occurs to me. But when people do reach out and want to spend time with me

Anyway, I never stayed in one place for more than 3 or 4 years at a time. I was forced to change friends frequently because of this, and never became too attached to any place or any particular person. In this way, I was forced to rely on myself and my immediate family for comfort, things to do, or whatever. In high school and middle school, I was a loner even within my own family. My brother and sister had a lot more in common with each other than either did with me

In college I was friends with the people who lived in my dorm, and not have to pretend or act a part to avoid ridicule. 

My girlfriend seems pretty fed up with this attitude I have about people and activities. She's extroverted and is always up for going out and spending time with people. But I rarely have any interest in doing that kind of thing. She's pretty sick of it, but not my friends. I just feel this crippling indifference. I know this is probably very alienating for my friends and they will eventually get tired of me and not even bother anymore. This happened with my college friend circle. Eventually they just stopped calling me. It's possible that will happen with this other circle of friends, and while I wouldn't like that to happen because I do like them, at the same time, I find it very difficult to motivate myself to spend time with them, especially since the activities they're interested in rarely interest me. 

I imagine people will suggest that I make an offer to my friends for an activity that I want to do. The problem with that is that many of the things I enjoy doing are things that are done alone, listening to music, etc. So I'm not really sure what to do. On the one hand, I really have a hard time caring. But on the other hand, I realize this may hurt me in the future and it certainly pisses off my girlfriend. 

Is there something wrong with me? I guess that's my big question. Is this just the way that I am and there's nothing to be ashamed of? Am I terrible narcissistic loner? Is this some kind of psychological problem I should work on?

Need perspective.,Rose_iso,6,1,3,"I want to premise the story with some relevant details of my history. Sorry it's kinda long and complicated. My parents divorced when I was 6 and it wasn't until I started dating late in my life that I realized I had some fear of 'abandonment' issues. Not only was I incredibly fearful of rejection (didn't dare date until college) but once I found myself in relationships

Everywhere I turn, single with a babe in hands trying to make ends meet in a dead end career. I think it's why I've always tried really hard to do well in school and am always worrying whether or not I'm doing enough to secure my future. It's been only recent that the idea of having kids has grown on me since I found my boyfriend, but even then I wouldn't DREAM of having kids unless I knew I could single-handedly support them without my partner's help. It's like in my mind when I think of kids I think of lost dreams and aspirations and more strain on a relationship but that's another issue together. Woowho that the country's divorce rate is at 50%

Where I see all this affecting me is that I freak out whenever I feel discord in the relationship. It's like I have no previous standard for what normal relationships are like so I worry if things are going well or if my moodiness will drive him away. It becomes a challenge to be as perfect as I think I could be which for me would be: being as sweet and positive towards my boyfriend 90% of the time, being indispensable to him. I like being needed because to me it means that I have purpose and can contribute to the relationship. However with my boyfriend I always seem to be the one that needs to cry on his shoulder or vent about my frustrations with my mother etc. 

That's another thing. I moved in with my boyfriend after 8 months because I was literally staying more at his house than mine, couldn't become the person I wanted to be under my mother's house.

 So I cut the cord and moved in and became a lot more confident of myself. I learned I'm an awesome cook

My relationship with my BF has been an intense and extremely honest one. We talk about everything and do not let things fester. We always make sure we're on the same page, have the same goals etc, have talked about how we would handle money, no issues on fidelity, we are really devoted etc. He says I make him whole and extremely happy. He tries to make me happy. We make each other laugh a lot, can spend tons of time together and not become tired. We have dreams of getting married in 3-4 years once our careers have stabilized. **Seems perfect and yet this feeling I have that something will happen and the other shoe will drop. Whether we will grow tired of each other or if we will grow apart and on and on. It seems impossible for me to relax into the relationship sometimes. I question my happiness**. Ugh. 

He's very understanding and knows that my heart is in the right place but my mind likes to torture me. Says not to worry or things could become a self-fulling prophecy and that from his side he will never let go of me

I've met my girlfriend about 6 months ago through a mutual sport we share, and, from what I understand, she has broken up most of them.

Now, I immediately notice, and vice versa. We talk. A lot. I think it's about the only solution to this, because, for example, if I notice something is bothering her, I start guessing what it might be; the only way to solve this is to just talk about the problem.

I would consider myself a very stable person, in which she doubts everything, is angry at everything, often at me too. This can sometimes hurt me (depending on what's she's angry about), but she's extremely sorry afterwards. I try to brush it off.

She needs a lot of space. I give her that (I need my space too, I suggest for her to go home and she's thankful for that. I have no problem with all that, everyone has their own weird things, I probably am not one of the easiest persons to be with either.

But what's really hurting me is when she talks about her doubts, she went abroad a few times in the past (a few months each), she travels a lot, and she still wants to continue doing that. No problem. But she also was planning on leaving to new zealand for a year before september (she turns 30 then, and you cannot easily get a work permit after turning 30.) I personally drew the line with the freedom I can give her with leaving for a year, or half a year even: I would have problems with that. I don't think I could do that. She thinks our relationship could survive (""if we're meant to be and if it's really that good between us, we can pick up where we left when I return"".) But she also says that these plans are not *that* serious, and I suspect that these kind of plans kind of help her cope. She even says something along those lines too (that these plans are some weird idealistic way for her to finally find some rest in life

Besides, she was the one taking initiative updating facebook status, etc.

So she's still in search for what makes her happy in life

This is making me feel extremely shitty. I cried two times in the last 2 weeks, and the reason she tells me is because I immediately notice when she's thinking about these things.

I'm a 23 year old male
He has had been with his girlfriend, and I've known her for about 2 years or so. 

At first I can't say I had any feelings for her and didn't really think of her as anything more than R, nothing serious. Last summer though (July '12) we went to A's cottage for a weekend, there was only a few of us, and I think it was here that R and I really got to know each other, spend time together, realized how much we had in common etc. After that weekend we started speaking a lot more, and it got to the point where we were texting each other every single day. So from roughly (July '12) to now we have been talking to each other alottt. We spoke about literally everything you can imagine, talk all day (unless we had work/school) say goodnight, we bought each other really nice birthday gifts

Then things started to get a little different. I knew I had been seeing her differently since that weekend, I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not in love with her, that it's because I've been single for a little while and she's just an amazing girl and I'm in love with what she represents. I would never want to take away what they (R and A) have, not that she would ever throw that away, and I realistically see them getting married in the future, having kids and being with each other forever. 

Regardless, if she took a while to respond to my messages, if she said anything regarding getting married and her future etc. I would be upset if it had been a little while since I hung out with her. I would constantly argue with her over things that didn't mean anything. All of this escalated to last Wednesday (march 13). I know she has school, and work and barely has time to see A as it is, yet I was arguing with her about not having hung out with me in a month. It kept going and going, to yesterday where she essentially told me that she wants to still be friends but she doesn't want to speak to me on a daily basis anymore, she wants me to treat her like one of my other guy friends (which wont ever happen), and the only reason I ever argue with her

Sorry for all this background, I always enjoyed talking to her on a daily basis, she's one of my best friends girlfriends and I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with him or her. I really just want things to go back to the way they used to be, I don't know if that will be possible though. Do I tell her about the feelings I had/have for her? Do I just respect her decision to not want to talk to me as much and not treat her any differently than my other friends? I don't know what to do, any help is appreciated.

**TL;DR  Have spent the last 9 months texting my friends girlfriend every single day, now she doesn't want me to speak to her as much anymore.

So when I was 19, and we went through some awesome situations together.  The both of us hit it  off immediately, we acted like we had been best friends for years.  Consequently, both of us fell for each other, and picked up on a relationship

After the trip, which lasted for about 8 months.  During that time, I found out that she had been hooking up with an old friend of hers in Canada, who I suppose had been in the ""friend-zone"" for a long time.  When she visited me in America, she informed me that he raped her, and when I became enraged, she completely defended him

Fast forward a couple of months


Fast forward about a year, goofy, and seems like she's really into me.  So I decided it was time to move on from my ex, and give the new girl a try.  We hit it off.  I can be myself around her, the sex is phenomenal, and her family adores me.

A couple of months down the road, that he doesn't understand her like I do, she loves me, blah blah blah.  And apparently this guy was verbally and emotionally abusive to her, which is why she left.  The next 6 months proceed to be an endless battle of tug of war, with her deciding which guy she wants to be with.

Who loses the fight?  You guessed it.  She packed up her bags and went back to her old town to be with this guy.  They got married 2 months ago.


Ok, and even the thought of having a serious relationship seems so far away for me.  I am bitter, pessimistic, and carry a misanthropic attitude with me almost all of the time.  The idea of marriage and intimacy makes me physically ill.

I am by no means perfect, just like me.  

But holy fuck, harmed or abused anyone I was close to.  So why do these girls leave me for guys who apparently hurt them so badly?  Is being in a healthy relationship with me really that much worse than being with a man who raped you?  I feel like a total waste, and a complete idiot.

I am so scared to invest my life into someone in a romantic way again.  Any advice or wisdom will not go unappreciated.

First off, I've also had a huge crush on him for about three years now. It used to be a lot worse than it is now and I currently think of him as more of an older brother than a romantic interest, BUT I still have some feelings for him that just don't seem to be going away.

On to the ""why it won't happen"" part and what I've already tried: He got a girlfriend a while back and I was pretty devastated. I had been planning on finally asking him out after a long time of crushing and I obviously waited too long. That was also when I realized that I really needed to stop crushing on him

He loves his girlfriend a lot and she feels the same way about him. I'd never do anything to break up their relationship as I care way too much about the friendship I have with him. I also generally try to not be a total asshole. I know that a common thing people say is ""avoid him/her"" but I'm looking for other solutions.

So, and we're both very shy. Work-related messaging starts to get a little bit more personal, I ask her if we can hang out sometime. She says yes, we go to museum etc., but she cuts it short - and I feel rejected. She nonetheless texts me saying she had great time. I text her that I did too - and we should do it again whenever she has time. She doesn't text me back, we see each other in some party before the summer and then she heads off to her birthplace for the summer.

Okay, because she manages to make us do one story for the zine together. So I do my best to act professional, but nope, feelings come again.

I tell her that I understand, and that I truly want our friendship to survive this - but also, because I'm drunk, I ask her whether she thinks we would have ever had a right time. She doesn't answer this really, rightly so...

1360917453.0,18kmwu,I [24F] always seem to have problems with friend groups/finding a friend group... advice please?,jumpedintotheriver,9,1,3,"Hello

I have recently graduated from University and feel like I have always struggled with having friends/a friend group and it really impacts on my enjoyment of life.

After leaving school, had sleepovers etc, but the group got torn to pieces when my best friend dumped one of the other guys and started going out with another... obviously it caused massive drama and the two guys do not speak anymore. During my first year of University, I realised I was not that close to my friend group from school anymore. Half of them had long-term relationships, and none of them were really that interested in socialising/partying/meeting new people. 

I decided to move cities, and felt like all my grievances from the previous year had finally been resolved. The next year, when we all went flatting (a group of 3-6 share a house), it fell apart again. I assumed we'd all stay close after our experiences together, but one of our friends started disliking the rest of our group (for reasons I don't really understand, spread rumours about us) and another that we lived with started disliking my friend and I because she was quite conservative and we liked partying and having fun (not a ridiculous amount or anything). I remember crying at the time because I was so sad that there had to be so much conflict and we couldn't just all get along and have fun together.

The next year was much better and we started having a proper group. I moved into a different flat and introduced my friends to some others that I had met. They hit it off and for a while things were going really well. We went on a mini holiday together, and after they broke up, she started hating him and wanted everyone to reject him as a friend. As if this wasn't bad enough, a close friend I lived with got upset with me for a relatively silly reason (I was busy with exams so was never home. She went to hospital for a minor operation but I wasn't aware as I hadn't talked to her for a few weeks. When she got back, I said something flippant to her, not knowing she had had an operation and she went nuts at me. Although I apologised profusely the next day, she said she didn't want to be friends anymore and we haven't talked since). So our group completely fell apart. I had to leave the place I was living because she got her friend to verbally abuse me everytime I returned home (she had previously been a really sweet girl).

The next year, everyone got along, and there was no cliques or bitchiness. 

After I graduated and moved back to my hometown, yet we were more different after I had spent so much time away. They all still had the same boyfriends since school (so since they were 15-16) and had never lived in a different city, never been out of their comfort zone etc. At work, I tried to reach out to people, but most had their own friends already, or were in intense relationships and didn't seem to really need anyone else.

I feel so alone and so sad that I don't really have any close friends. Everytime a holiday comes around I don't have plans, and I don't understand why I am the one who doesn't have one. EVERYONE I know is still close with either their group from school or University (or are so invested in their SO they don't really mind). Most of my friend groups from University have really strong bonds with their school friends (who have been through numerous breakups, live in different cities, been overseas etc... I seem to be the ONLY person with such a sheltered group of friends from school). Just the other day I saw on Facebook a group of people who I knew from University through an ex boyfriend planning a trip overseas together and I felt really down.

I don't really understand why this happens to me. I am a friendly, but sometimes I wonder whether that was accidental or something. 

I've noticed that the people I get to know personally who have lots of close friends tend to actually be quite rude and flippant at times to others, and they will barely say one word to me - I can't work out how they have so many friends when they don't seem friendly at all ?!?! I've also chatted to other girls who have had similar fights with friends/ fall outs with groups but 90% end up making up a few months later.

I feel so down about it, but now I feel like I've been burnt so many times that I don't want to try. I'm too scared to do things I want to do (ie move overseas) as I don't want to wind up completely alone which I feel will inevitably happen. Other friends who moved overseas did so with close groups of friends. I feel so angry at the world that I keep on getting put in this situation.

I guess I'm starting to feel as though I'm the problem

I have noticed these threads throughout my life:
1. I tend to warm quite quickly to guys and make friends with guys really easily. 
2. I have been treated really nastily by girls in the past. One of my best friends at school totally ripped off a speech I was doing to become prefect
3. People have dropped me as friends over things that have nothing to do with them
4. People tend to think I'm being nasty when I never am. They sometimes misconstrue what I'm saying as being mean when I'm careful to not say anything offensive. For example, that's horrible"" (over fb/text) they think I'm being sarcastic.

He has since dropped off a package full of sentimental stuff from our relationship on my doorstep at probably 3 in the morning and mailed me a postcard.

I left my email open to him because I have some of his stuff still and have had a hard time returning it because there is a lot of it and I do not have a car.

Anyone else had to file a restraining order over this kind of harassment? I know my situation is not unique and I put off ending the relationship just because I did not want to deal with a situation like this.

Long story short, he would have had this restraining order on his record while applying for future jobs *and* he would have had to do 52 weeks of domestic violence classes.

Back in high school, relevantly or not, is several years older; not a relationship thing at all) watched me go through a very bad relationship. She was there through a lot of tears and a lot of drama (girlfriend at the time said she was going to kill herself, etc). During this, I think she wanted me to see there was a lot better; I was afraid to end it because I was afraid there wasn't better and our stupid promises to get married stuck in my head despite the fact that deep down I knew it wasn't working. Anyway, she introduced me to her cousin (we'll call her Sidney), who is a couple years younger than me and a total sweetheart. She lived three hours away though; this was a problem because she and I found that we liked each other a lot. She came to town to visit my friend and we tried to spend time together but it didn't work too well. We continued to talk via Facebook/Skype for a while, so I think that put some stress on her as well. About a year or year and a half after we first met

Sidney and I stayed in contact every now and then for a while, and some of their family are more of a family to me than my own). We were really excited to see each other as we hadn't in a couple of years at this point. When she got there and I saw her, my heart just started pounding. She has a way of making me melt. We talked and texted one another a LOT throughout the weekend, and ended up both a little tipsy and flirting very heavily with one another. She kept begging me to take her for a ride on my motorcycle (I wish I had now :( ), but we couldn't really get away for long enough due to the family. Fast forward, it's time for Sidney and her parents/siblings to go home three hours away and people are saying their goodbyes. We are still texting and tell one another we are sad we missed our chance to kiss; we had felt the tension all weekend but not acted (note: she was still dating Jake at this time). She texted me and asked me to meet her inside, and when I did we had a totally cliche moment where we stared into one another's eyes as we slowly moved in and brushed lips.

We stopped and looked at one another and moved to where we wouldn't be seen and shared a few more kisses. It should be noted that her touch and her kiss felt like nothing I had ever felt before with anyone (I had dated or hooked up with a fair number of girls since my crazy ex) and still have never experienced. I am a horribly hopeless romantic and stuff like that sticks to me; to me

We Skyped almost every night for hours for about a week afterward. We talked about what we needed to do; she wasn't particularly happy with her relationship at the time and we wanted each other. I also told her that I had been secretly sleeping with someone on and off for over a year (details aren't important as she didn't know them either; leave it at my high school relationship ended in a very fucked up manner and I made a lot of poor decisions following it that I didn't know how to get out of once I had started) We were at a point where we could have made the distance work and both wanted to. She told me, kissed, and watched the sun set. It still set my skin on fire to touch her or to kiss her, so I didn't and don't see it as a fluke.

A few days later, but she told me, ""I don't think I can talk to you anymore. I can't risk losing Jake again."" I was in shock, and all I could say was ""o....ok...."" before she hung up the phone. I was rather heartbroken, too much so for something that had been a week, but I was. I removed her from Facebook, deleted her number (which didn't matter as I know it by heart)

Addiction to infatuation, I cannot seem to be able to resist the Siren song of a new female. This happens about every month or so. I get to know a friend-of-a-friend, a stranger a the club or a new coworker and completely fall for them. For a time lasting from a few days to weeks they occupy my thoughts completely. I might even go out for coffee with them on a pretence of ""just as friends"" or just chat online. And the feelings this invokes are the best I know, beating any hobby, substance or other vice I have tried. I'm not mistaking this for pure sexual attraction. I might not escalate these crushes to the level of a sexual relationship even if I were single (although admittedly, I did in the case of my current SO).

The roots of my issues go down to the fact that I've lost everything I have ever cared about, but I can't, no matter how hard I try. 

This will sound horribly pathetic to most, this was my entire life. I'm a very tech savvy guy, and that probably just made me ignore the fact that I could do a mistake like this, so I never cared for frequent backups. What's even more silly, is that once I had transferred pictures from my phone to the computer, I deleted them off the phone immediately, not because of lack of storage

I don't know how to express myself properly about all this, like a handful of salt in an open wound. To put it into perspective, I'd much rather have these files for one last day and then die peacefully, that's how much this has destroyed me.

I guess I'm just looking for someone that have any experience with


And a little about myself, but that hasn't helped my self-confidence or social skills the tiniest bit. I over-analyze absolutely everything around me, including myself, and I constantly 'talk' to myself (silently, of course) as a part of the analyzing thing.

I've tried seeing both doctors and psychiatrists, so I completely block it all out, being unable to get to the actual problem of the whole situation - and it's like I can't even control it, while still being fully aware of what is happening.

Just to put things into perspective, and generalized anxiety disorder.  I've been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons (suicidal thoughts and gestures) 4 times since 2011.  

I've been living with my parents since November 2012 and have been in the hospital twice for issues that I've had with them.  This is more than just a pattern.  I know I’ve been enabling their behavior by not resisting but I’m scared of losing them for some reason.

I have been told by many people that my parents are extremely dysfunctional and that their behavior towards me has bordered on

Since moving out of my parents' house after starting college in 2005, from my relationships with friends to where I was at every moment of every day.

They discouraged me from finishing graduate school when I was 15 credits shy of completing it (I was working FT and taking classes FT.  I was over-stressed during that semester and ended up having to drop an ""easy"" class early on.  Although they weren't paying for it

In high school

They've also been manipulative with my money (savings bonds in my name are being withheld right now because I'm unemployed).

They've refused to help me get treatment when I needed it most and it took a suicidal gesture with a plan to OD in order to get them to take me to the hospital.   My parents wouldn’t let me see my old psych nurse practitioner or therapist  because it would be out of pocket although I desperately needed help ASAP.

I was raped in college by a stranger.  My mother tried to accept guilt for not having been able to protect me from 2 hours away.  I think she still thinks that it somehow happened for a reason.

My dad [49] is explosive and extremely angry.  I've never seen him show much of anything else.  He doesn't have a drinking problem or anything but he can go from 0-60 in a heartbeat and then he can't be reasoned with.  Things always have to be done ""his way"".  There's no room for compromise.

My mother [57] is very meek and submissive.  She usually just goes along with whatever my father says.  She's intrusive and a ""helicopter"" parent.  She has this idea that she always knows what's best despite my resistance or differing ideas.  I feel like my mom's hovering is her way of trying to express love but she refuses to actually accept responsibility.  She feels it is her right to go rifling through my stuff and reading my journals.  While I was in the hospital

They tell me that they want me to be independent but they don't want to allow me out of their sight to fail at anything.  I don’t want to be coddled anymore.

I've been told over and over again that crying is unacceptable and a sign of weakness.  I feel like my feelings have always been stuffed and it’s never been encouraged for me to share what’s on my mind.

Let me also just say that my dad and brother are super-close.  I've never been close with him or either of my parents.  My parents deny this by saying that we've done superficial things like going to the zoo or out for dinner.

I recently talked with my aunt (my dad's sister) about how these issues have been affecting my life and she came out about the physical

Since my diagnosis and hospitalizations, which she might be acting supportive out of guilt from what she did to her daughters.  I'm really scared by learning this new information.

I know this probably doesn't sound as bad as I'm making it out to be but it really hurts and I want out.  I know that I can't ""fix"" my parents and although they've been trying to be helpful and supportive

TL;DR - I grew up with controlling parents.  My dad's mother was abusive at least to his sisters

1360090550.0,17y3ic,[20f] I am watching with growing horror as I mirror my parents' relationship patterns.,frideswide,7,1,8,"So, were my age once

TL;DR: After several failed almost-relationships, who shared a very unhappy marriage and STILL, eight years later, harbor enormous grudges against one another. I do not want to be the same as them. Some kids wanted to be doctors or actresses or cooks growing up. I wanted to be a mother. But I do not want to make my kids as miserable as my parents have made me or my brother, ever. I would like to start taking proactive steps, because this entire situation has, in the past three years, not better. I have no idea where to start. It is tough to make this into a TL;DR. You might just have to read it.

It's not that I am completely unexperienced when it comes to romantic relationships. I have endured SEVERAL almost-relationships. I say almost because it's stuff like, my anxiety over the issue gets worse, and I am more afraid of having these conversations, and I feel like I am becoming WORSE at them, not better, due to anxiety.

Another trend I have noticed: every one of these five times another girl has been involved, sometimes I don't even know she even existed until months after the fact. I can't even call it two-timing because I've never been in a relationship, but I have had guys tell me that they are seeing ONLY me, and then go back on it without telling me. I'm asking people to go with me and believe that I'm not a crazy, overattatched bitch here. All five of these guys I am mentioning have led me on. 

I worry because I feel like there is something essentially wrong with me that I cannot identify. Nobody has ever given me a reason for WHY it won't work. I have asked, that girl has become permanent. 

I worry because my parents' marriage was incredibly fucked up. They divorced eight years ago; they have not communicated in any way other than via email/text in about six years. Along with me

My dad has been married three times; he cheated on my mom, supportive, fantastic former stepmother as well. I love my dad to death, but I am slowly coming to realize that he is not the upstanding, moral individual I have always thought him to be. My former stepmom and I are INCREDIBLY similar people (when I met her, I actually balked at first and didn't like her for several months because she was TOO similar to me and I though it was creepy), now that I'm older and watching my dad date again

My dad has also always been very intent on relationships. It's tough to explain. He thinks there is something wrong with me; he finds his ladies through Match.com and has proposed that I get a Match account before. He has offered to pay for it. A common criticism to my fashion or even behavioral choices in high school was

My mom has been married twice. Her second husband is incredibly wealthy and kind of a jerk (though very generous to my mom/brother/me); he is an alcoholic, and incredibly shitty and unfair for my brother.

Suffice to say, but my mom's father was emotionally abusive (interestingly and perhaps relevantly, I also know that my mom's maternal grandfather was, though an incredibly intelligent, talented individual, also not so good at relationships--he was married seven times). Most of what I know is that he was an asshole. My mother has done some decidedly crazy stuff (taking my door off my bedroom as punishment, for months, getting caught by the house sitter and subsequently getting in a physical fight with that house sitter

I worry that I am heading down a bad road. I don't want to be hurt again. I am becoming extremely afraid of guys who portray any attraction to me, assholes. I don't understand it, because I'm a nice, well-liked person. I was not well-liked in middle/high school, so I know what it feels like. People like me now. I'm friendly and ""known"" for always being bubbly and enthusiastic. 

As I said, seemingly, generations? I want to have kids one day, I want them to have a father that is in their lives, and two parents that, even if divorced, can pull their shit together enough to NOT make their kids lives miserable. I have a feeling I am off track. Everyone keeps telling me to just stop worrying about it but FUCK at what point am I supposed to start worrying?

There have been others. Guys that were in love with somebody else, it's those guys that are a problem.

There've been a couple. One was a total dick

So we get to the reason why I'm writing this now. 

This weekend, and things escalated. Clothes stayed on, lips didn't touch, but you still can do a whole lot wrong without doing those things. Yesterday we went drinking, bar closed and we went to my place. Things almost escalated again, but I kicked him out.

I didn't kick him out because I didn't want stuff to happen. Even though I feel guilty as fuck about it

Being a good person is very important to me. It's something I take pride in. Messing with relationships is a big nono in my theoretical framework

Here's a quick rundown of my situation:

I'm male

She is 22. We work together and know each other for 2 years now. She, but recently he engaged to her.

Which brings me to my dilemma. I feel terribly guilty for having those feelings for her. She seems happy with her soon-to-be husband and he's a nice guy. I don't want to hurt their relationship (and I don't think I could even if I wanted to). But I just can't keep living like I don't have those feelings for her. She's in my head way more often than I care to admit. Sometimes its so bad

I want her out of my head without losing her as a friend. I feel like I betray our friendship lately because I want more than just being friends, or make it all weird to hang out afterwards. Or in short, in a way that doesn't cost us our friendship.

So...Is this even possible? Should I scrap my plan and find another way of dealing with this somehow? And if so

And just to be clear: I don't expect her to feel the same way

PS: She is a bit anti-social and doesn't have many friends due to a colorful past. I suspect that she won't know how to react if I were to confront her with my feelings. My top priority is to avoid hurting her.

I have a surgical scar on my backside from when I was a baby. I had a benign tumor near my sciatic nerve, and it's caused me grief about my body my entire life. I can't (or I suppose a more accurate word would be ""won't"") wear certain swimsuits, certain cuts of underwear, etc. I was teased in the locker room ALL THE TIME as a child about it. Part of me is afraid that, if I were to have a relationship with a man and he saw it, he'd get repulsed and leave. I dress very modestly, to the point where I've been called a prude, because I'm not at all. I'm just as much a sexual being as any other person. 

I feel guilty for wanting things. For instance, and it just doesn't seem fair to me that I'd get some cool gadget when someone somewhere else doesn't know where their next meal is coming from. My parents said they'd give a bit to Make-A-Wish, but that I deserve something, and while the rational part of me would agree with them, I still feel guilty. I actually cried when my sister asked me what I wanted for Christmas. I just don't think about things I want. I KNOW it's supposed to be something fun, not something to stress out over, and I don't know why I do it.

I have a tendency of pushing people away. I'm just so afraid of being hurt

My family and friends all think I'm too harsh on myself. I go to work and I go to school. My social life is severely limited (at least partially due to being an art student, as they are meant to be helpful, but every once in a while, I just feel like I'm not good enough. I have this habit of apologizing for EVERYTHING. It's this compulsion I'm so scared I'll never be able to shake.

Alot of schools out there (mine included) are commuter universities. Derivably, don't result from the vehicles themselves, but rather arise when you navigate the walkways, and enter the classrooms. Everyone is walking by themselves, save a strong minority that is inherently attracted to body heat. 

Now I'm not saying they're losers; that they have no friends. That would be the epitome of empty-mindedness. And if I may derail

You enter the classroom and if it's not the first day you see that everyone sits seats apart. That's still no big deal because who doesn't like their space?

But then the class ends and the atmosphere of engagement is swept away as the breaths and colognes and body washes slowly fade

You're slow to get up. Maybe you raise your eyebrows while having your eyelids closed so that it appears to others as if you are fatigued

I know alot of other universities are different

I used to believe in this big farce of adding everyone on facebook and myspace and I'll admit it was somewhat of a confidence boost having all those ""friends"" on paper. I also embraced the concept being able to engage multiple people with texting and messaging. 

But a while back I started deleting people on my facebook. I scaled back to just acquiantances. Then just people I knew. Then just people I had talked to on facebook. Then just friends. Then just good friends. I think I ended up somewhere around 26 people when I realized I didn't really care about any of them.

Usually I can back down on arguments with normal people before they get heated by just laughing it off and changing the subject. I try to avoid conflict in general.


However, since I do genuinely care about their point of view. My two closest friends (both male) I've known them since forever, so they just acknowledge the fact that I'm ridiculously stubborn, and chances are I am just taking the devil's advocate side if I'm being ridiculously stubborn during an argument. I mean, I grew up with these guys - we call each other horrible things and we just laugh it off. Just to throw it out there, one of them jokes that I would probably defend Hitler if he was still around.


With my girlfriend (more sensitive person) though (also applicable rare cases with other people and my close buddies)


1) I am actually correct regarding the whatever was going on. This generally doesn't happen because when I'm right it seems like I don't argue, I don't provoke them or say things along the lines of 'haha I was right'.


2) It's an opinion argument, and the subject is changed. However, there's almost no chance I will give up my stance. I am stupidly stubborn, and I know it, but that's a different problem.


3) When the argument ends up where I am wrong. Hey, and my girlfriend and someone else can actually change my mind. Here is when the problem starts.


I have to say that this doesn't apply to things like if I said we don't have juice but we actually do, so my stance on the matter was probably wrong to begin with. As the argument goes on I actually do think that I am in the wrong. However, there is this part of me that just refuses to 'give up the fight'. I know it sounds stupid, but suddenly the problem is personal, and I find myself trying to defend a side I don't actually believe in anymore.


To make myself sound even more dumb
""...I understand what you mean
and ""...I agree with you


I seriously should just say something like ""yeah I'm I'm totally wrong

Me and my girlfriend had been dating six months, being young and what not, I was really scared and nervous. So i bought her a pregnancy test, it came out negative, but she had all of the symptoms of being pregnant. I told my friends about this and they were saying stuff like ""so when are you going to leave her?"" or ""abortion or what?"" i dont know if this makes me different, but i honestly wanted that kid.

But with K, even though she was just my friend, I always felt at least a bit happy, knowing she was there for me. I can't talk to my gf like I did with K, because my gf doesn't understand the issues I tend to have in life, and usually doesn't know the right thing to say, but now once my gf is gone away I end up feeling just as alone and empty as ever.

Also, I have discovered that I am fairly fragile, I've been prone to depressions and have gone self-harming and suicidal in the past, usually when I am alone (such as the period between saying goodbye to K and meeting my gf). I tend to think far too much and usually end up hurting myself with my own thoughts, which just makes it worse. Plus I have extreme antisocial tendencies, which keeps me alone once I'm there.

Dated a girl from 16-19

I went through a year of hell but I did the whole NC (obviously) and after a year of coping and sleeping around I finally felt over her. 

I then found a new girlfriend, I explained that it was because of trust issues having been betrayed like I was. But, against everything I told myself to do, after a year I fell for her. We had a great 4 more months then she cheated on me with another friend. So we don't see each other anymore, not spoken to her since the day she told me and I left. 

Here's the thing, I have work friends, I talk to people, but I'm just super apathetic about everyone. I literally don't have anyone in the world I care about anymore who aren't family (and most of them are dead). It's weird, I don't even really feel lonely, I just feel quite numb. I don't want to make friends because it feels like a waste of time and I can't even muster up enough energy to talk to women unless I'm trying to take them home.

Hey all

So something the therapist and I came across today was the fact that I seem to be driven entirely by a sense of responsibility to other people and not by a desire to have fun or to be happy. For some reason I seem to just really be turned off by the idea of having fun, or doing anything of recreational value that I don't see as immediately beneficial to others.

The problem is that this really screws up my relationships with others

I think this realization really came when I made a list of things to do this summer (I'm in Australia) and nowhere in the top-twenty was something that was purely for fun's sake.

We went through my past but I really have no idea where this comes from. I have depression that comes and goes

Relationship-wise, I was extremely attracted to her physically and intellectually, but her personality was abrasive to mine and made me unhappy. I lost my virginity to her, she thought she loved me. I wasn't sure how I felt. I stuck with it for a while because I kept wondering if I was just being too picky and maybe the problem was with my own outlook on things, but eventually I wised up and realized it just wasn't going to work and I didn't want to hurt her. I broke things off.

I am an only child. Most people I know were surprised to learn that

So this brings us to the basic problem that I'm dealing with now. Every time I start to get close to someone, and it's not fair to me. It ends up making me feel trapped by my inability to be content with someone.

I also am serially non-casual. If I go out with a girl and we start to get physical (I'm talking intro stuff like holding hands or making out), not fair to anyone.

So at the end of the day, trying to say to myself ""you're being dumb. stop"" then that usually accompanies a mild feeling of dread associated with seeing someone. Dread basically stemming from the question of ""how long until I realize this doesn't really work.""

It's also probably relevant to note that I am very good at dating. I am a good conversationalist and make people feel at ease. I am generally the one not wanting a second date, and I just make myself anxious.

I recently went on a date with someone I asked out that I met at a party. I'm attracted to them, I also felt like we didn't really connect on humor or lifestyle. It's probably way too early to make those kinds of judgment calls, but my scumbag brain won't let it go. I always do this to myself. I'm seeing her again this week, but it's almost like I've already defeated this relationship before it even had a chance.

I think I may do this to myself because past relationships I've had have been only so/so (never felt like I was in love, I'm not going to settle just because I have a crush on them at first. I need to actually really see it going somewhere.""

Last point - many of my friends are in serious relationships with girls they spend a ton of time with. I want that
Reddit, but I get anxious about relationships so easily I just feel like it would leave me hopeless and bruised, more so than just sitting here feeling sorry for myself and waiting for the right girl (who I can't even really imagine) to materialize in front of me.

Also - please don't just tell me to ""chill out"". I'm pretty sure that's what I need to do

TL;DR: I'm way too serious for my age. I focus way too much on why things won't work and let those thoughts turn all possible relationships into this feeling of dread, I'm very concerned that I'm far too picky and am letting a lot of opportunities go just because the concept of dating someone I'm not head-over-heels for gives me a stomach ache.

I really internalized this admonition to not become like her. And from a logical point of view, I've had several romantic relationships and I've done a lot of traveling. I have lots of interests and hobbies, and I had a career I was passionate about, and left it to pursue something else I am passionate about.

I feel hopeless, like I am fighting my true destiny to be Just Like My Aunt. I also look like her, so it kind of sucks seeing her every time I look in the mirror.

I just am at a complete loss as to what to do about it. Sometimes the hopelessness is so overwhelming I just want to give in

I'm 21 and I'm looking for a girl who shares my experience level that I actually like, I don't have any particular physical traits or list, I just want a girl I connect with. Chemistry is the most important thing for me. I just never feel like it's there.

I grew up with a really good attractive personality but was placed in a bad environment and picked on during my life

I grew up

At the same time I'm not sure how much chemistry I have to have for me to finally go, and one I can connect with. Whether there's an LTR or not isn't an issue for me, I'm open to anything.

I also have some huge anxieties about my virginity, or even her reaction. I always want to talk about sex, past relationships, etc but I'm never able to because I have no background so I avoid these topics altogether.

 I've read several thread about virginity and guys on /r/askwomen and some of the replies make me feel uncomfortable in several ways. They range from negative which is unfortunate and worries me to reactions that are positive but in a disturbing uncomfortable way of, or the whole, ""Aww it's adorable and cute"". All these reactions make me feel embarrassed, emasculated, and turned off. I am not pet to train. I am not a cute puppy. I don't want to be treated differently. I avoid sleeping with women because I am uncomfortable with these reactions, *not because I value a number.* The girl I got closest to sleeping with had an extensive history, she was everything I was looking for but she moved to europe. so please hold judgments.

This is an issue that many virgin women often have(Just switch the roles and imagine a guy saying the above about a girl..doesn't sound so nice does it?), and not because they're pitying me or offering me a prize that I've never had.

I'm also uncomfortable with the power dynamics in a situation like this, emotionally( she thinks I'll be attached or clingy), psychologically(she has all the power its not equal making me feel emasculated) sexually(I'm dominant but my first time I'll be in a very weak position that makes me turned off). I'm very turned off at the ""Oh my god, congratulations I am doing this for you"" sort of pity thing. Sex isn't a gift you give to someone, it's something you share with someone. *I just an EQUAL partner that doesn't treat me differently.* So I'm looking for someone with an equal experience. On top of this, due to my appearance women just naturally assume I'm experienced and want me to take the lead.

I don't have any expectations that I do not follow myself of course. I make sure to stay very clean, I exercise and I just love making friends. I'm very social with a really fun personality.

I met a girl 19(we'll call her Athena) circa 2011, making up stories about us and such. Well after awhile and away from the prying eyes of the stalker me and Athena forged a relationship in secrecy. We dated for a few weeks before I broke it to the stalker girl after she pressed my boundaries a little to hard one time and she went off on me and attempted to sabotage the relationship. It put heavy strain on both of us but we pressed on regardless. We dated through the winter and onto Valentines, which is where I started faltering.

Never in my life had I ever celebrated the festivities, between the stalker, my previously damaged affections from 2004, losing my car, my job and living in an abusive home (more deets?) I took it upon myself to coerce her into a break.

Something I needed to try and get my shit together, and after 3 days of crying and partaking of... some ill-advised decisions. Her friends talked her down to trying again and giving me a shot to explain, from there we dated a few more months before I realized I really couldn't be the man that I wanted to be for her, I couldn't be the adult and handle the situation without a job, a car or a stable environment.

So once again I took it upon myself (this time in person) to explain the situation, to be a better person for her...

So I enlisted with the American Army, and no soon after we had a discussion about removing the intimacy both physical and non from out friendship. This was a direct blow to me, having begun falling in love again. I tried to shake the feeling but I can't, everything just hurts now. I've stopped going to my mandatory PT for pre-boot camp, telling my SSG I've been working when really I haven't had the strength to roll out of bed.

26m and a loveless virgin (dramatic isn't it)

So

I've pretty much felt this way for a while. In middle school I would pine for different girls but always felt like a weirdo about it. Then in high school I finally got my own internet connection and figured out masturbation

Whenever I tried to draw on people I know or non-pornographic source for inspiration, my first thought is I can never speak to that person again.

I used to masturbate at least twice a day until I met this girl, to this girl barely clinging to life sharing all of her pain with me.

One innocent afternoon I started jabbing her in the butt with this giant medicine ball sized...ball, she brutally criticizes me out of nowhere, saying I should just be good enough at it to keep her from getting distracted by the TV and that it was offensive that she felt me get hard against her leg. So I didn't dare try anything like that again.

A few months later she sets me up with her unattractive friend that I went along with because I was desperate for a girlfriend, saying when a girl gets her first kiss that it shouldn't be made fun of, it should be perfect and all this other Disney-esque bullshit. Any time I didn't treat this girl like a total princess, Karen would chew me out. All of my natural instincts were suddenly dead wrong.

I eventually got dumped

Then things get even weirder. My girlfriend receives a mysterious call at my house which leaves her really upset so I just held her instead of wondering how the fuck anyone knew to call her at my house instead of her cell. Then she suddenly can't see me as often. When we do see each other outside of class

Apparently this control freak was snooping on the girl's AOL account when he finds a screen name he doesn't recognize: Karen's. So he starts talking to her and she basically told him what was up and gave him enough contact info to call my fucking house. Karen even pretty much told me all this and it didn't even occur to me to get furious at her

Not even a week later Karen announces that I should have a rebound girl and it would be one of her friends again. She was cuter this time but again my only real interest was not getting kicked in the balls again so hard that I throw up. We saw each other on weekends until we both decided nothing's going and broke it off amicably.

After that Karen would randomly get sexually aggressive with me out of nowhere, coming over and announcing she wasn't wearing panties under her skirt then getting mad at me for playfully trying to call her out on it. It comprises the majority of my sexual experiences and it's all fucking shit.

This was all about 6-7 years ago. I've felt too horrible since to really pursue dating again. I had a few opportunities in college but I hated myself too much to take them up. Masturbation typically upsets my stomach even though I don't feel overwhelming guilt. I feel guilty for any eye contact I make with women. I feel some kind of awful pressure that my only 'girlfriend' in the last 7 years was a long distance thing with an asshole who kept me on the hook for 3 months because she can't get over her passion for abusive men.

I wish I could just drop all of this baggage because it's eating away at me

I just want to relax and feel OK with finding women attractive to the point of keeping interest long enough to go on a date. I feel so broken and lonely and rotten.",,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/w6603/guilt_and_the_opposite_sex/

I have always considered myself straight but am definitely bicurious

I have never been in a relationship and the only physical intimacy i have ever had with anyone was 3 years ago i kissed a girl i really liked.  She was aware of my full feelings toward her and a few hours after the   (roughly 5 second) kiss she told me that she felt nothing and that we would not work as a couple.  After this my group of friends continued to hang out with both her and I

Since that incident i have never let anyone i have had intimate feelings towards know that and i have an overwhelming fear of rejection and a disconnect from other people.

I have never told anyone all of this together but i needed to get it off my back.  Hopefully Reddit

   We spent the next year together and our relationship was put to the test by her needing to move out due to her graduating. I still had to remain in this current city to finish up school. We broke up for a few days because she didnt think long-distance would work

   Flash-foreword to now and we agree that we will see each other every weekend. Our plan is to take turns driving between cities and this would be possible due to the semi-short drive(2 hours). I visit her over this last weekend by taking a greyhound bus to her, thier rules, but they pull this out of nowhere as they used to let us do the opposite of this. Still, I am fine with this. I spend the weekend with her and head back to my city after. 

   Later that night,"" I think, ""I will be finished with school by then...no problem."" However, she then begins to start pointing out flaws within me and drops ""I just don't know if I could marry you,"" onto me. I am shocked because we hadnt really talked about marriage yet but its a bit demeaning to have your girlfriend place that upon you. I asked her question about why she thought that and I got her to admit that she liked the idea of us married but there was one gaping issue. She didn't want to say at first, because she felt terrible for thinking it, but I finally insisted that she at least let me know. She slowly informed me that she ""didnt want to feel like a giant."" 

   I was confused. Yes, if I were at least an inch taller than her. I begin to feel like shit because I have tried my hardest to treat her as best as I feel possible, and in the end, this is what matters most to her. She kicks around the idea that she isnt sure about ""us"" but decides that we are too important to each other and she will try her hardest to work on the height issue.

  This answer is bittersweet to me because she is acting like she is doing me a favor in ""looking past it

  When I ask her about what specifically bothers her about the height difference, but I am still shaken up by this.  She goes on to tell me she is attracted to me sexually(we have fantastic sex), emotionally,and intellectually.Essentially, she understands that we work well together and her only reason for disliking me is both illogical and silly.

I've liked this girl (17) and I'm 17 male, and it seemed to be going perfectly. Then a couple days later we went to a movie and afterwards parked in a car park which was deserted and talked and stuff for over 4 hours. The first two hours was normal just friendly flirting, hugging, a little kissing. Then after talking a lot about it we came to the decision that it wouldn't work being in a relationship because of school also she's highly religious (or her parents are) and they wouldn't approve of someone outside the church. So the last half hour we kinda did a few things I'm not proud of, as in inappropriate touching and such. Then we went back to our houses. So I was in disbelief because firstly I didn't think that that would have happened then after that I didn't know what to do, so I left it for a few days to work it out in my head... 

Well lets just say that was a few days to many and she is EXTREMELY angry with me now because we didn't talk about it instantly and because she believes it is all my fault that we did those things in the car. I am going to be talking to her tomorrow and really need some advice on how to approach how sorry I am for being such a retard and dickhead....

But if you have any words to offer, have at it and I will appreciate it all.

In short, I've always had a little crush on her.  Anyhow, I'd never been so content in my life with this woman actively wanting to come to my house, watching our favorite shows, chainsmoking on my balcony and some light drinking, talkin shit, listening to music

We went on a few dates and got a little closer every time, one thing led to another and we had some incredible sex, just one night.  I think that's what fucked it all up, because from that point on, she turned back into a ""girl"" about it all, and the games started.  I devolved into a fucking simp and took her to Olive Garden, buying her shit, the essential ""tryhard"".  A couple more ""just friends"" hangouts later with no sex and she revealed she didn't want a relationship with me. I asked her about when we got intimate and in so many words she said she was horny and in the right place at the right time.  I didn't blame her

There's no shortage of females around me, and I had to get my mind off of the woman I really wanted, so I took her up on it.  It was working out pretty nice and we were pretty great for eachother, until she said (on some unrelated shit) some really hurtful shit to me.  I ended up saying goodbye to her (because if there's one thing I don't tolerate from women I date, it's saying hurtful shit to me), and that's when I went straight back to square one.

Still having pretty strong feelings for my ideal, the more we still text and talk, the more we continue flirting, the more I think about that one time we got intimate, the more we hang out either one on one or in groups with our friends, the more I know that I love this woman.

A relationship is not happening.  She is still a good friend of mine and I immensely value our friendship, I think that blowing off that kind of steam could accelerate my ""healing"", so to speak. Thanks Marvin Gaye).  But a relationship is not happening and I accept that.  

I say I love her because I do. But I KNOW she's not my one and only.  Love takes TWO people who are in it together.  The fact that she doesn't love me back is proof enough for me that she is not the one.  I value myself far too much to keep this bullshit up for any extended amount of time and a woman who doesn't reciprocate my love is undeserving of it. It just sucks that she doesn't have the same feelings I have for her.  Does it make me weak for still feeling the way I do?  Probably.  I suppose that's why I'm writing this.  In all likelihood

He told me he wants to break up early because ""what's the point"" and he doesn't feel stable if he has a girlfriend who is leaving soon. I feel really awful about it. And rejected. I said I wanted no contact for the next 3 weeks, which made him feel bad- but I feel even worse that he wants to stay ""friends"" or ""friends with benefits.""

And I'm going home, he's in. Basically I feel like he's going to go on to have an awesome life and I'll just float along. 

So that's the first part. Also, we're on strike. So I feel depressed because I can't earn my own goddamn money, and at the age of 23, have to ask my parents for help- that's humiliating.

I realized today while reading another post that one of the many things that contributed to the breakup was some issues I had with my brother.

I, and generally meaner individual would spend my childhood and most of my teenage years making him feel like shit, a lot.

My mother psychologically abused me when I was about 8, and I hated high school. I go to therapy now, and it helps a lot.

But the reality is, or that nobody would miss him. I really was doing terrible things, and I didn't even really know it, because I was still so hurt inside.

Last year, even though I was at college most of the year. He was being neglected by my entire family, he is addicted/dependent on cigarettes and weed, and he had stolen money from some family members. His life was taking a downward spiral, partly because of the traumatic childhood, and partly because he was being held to a higher standard than he was capable, and partly because his own family turned their backs on him, he felt like he couldn't trust anyone

I have since made every effort possible to make him feel better, and is generally doing a lot better. Our relationship has improved greatly, I love my brother a lot and if anything happened to him I don't know what I'd do.

This transition affected my relationship with my girlfriend greatly. For one, and i think this made me more aggressive, less forgiving, and generally a worse boyfriend than I had been before. I was dealing with the reality that my brother wasn't to blame for his issues, and all of a sudden I couldn't get over the idea that everyone who wasn't learning disabled, including my girlfriend, was fully to blame for all their problems. I was really, and started a lot of arguments

My brother said to me the other day that when I used to yell at him

I know what he meant now, because I would act bipolar if I was under a lot of stress, and I didn't know how to handle it. This happened a few times with my girlfriend, and I scared her a lot.

Unfortunately, she contributed to a lot of my stress also, and it was generally a dysfunctional relationship. I guess I just realized today that when my brother threatened suicide it turned my life upside down, and I didn't know how to deal with it, so I smoked more and argued with my girlfriend more.

I don't get it. Every girl I date (officially, fling, etc) always ends with the same punchline: I'm the one who falls for them, for whatever reason, they don't feel the same way, and then things degrade to the point of hatred/pain/blame/anger until we stop talking.

I'm 20, I've had two serious relationships, though I would consider myself to have fallen in love with three different girls. Let me explain a little.

The first time I fell in love, school resumed with me joining our school's Senate, mostly to try to and get closer to her (she was already in it). I had spent the majority of high school career to that point shit-talking Senate, and my friends were disgusted with me when they found out I joined. After a long, violent, drawn out meltdown between them and I, they called me a sell out and exiled me from their group. At first I wasn't too upset because I figured I could trade old friends for new ones in Senate, I began to understand the pettiness that my new peers operated with, too emotional

That relationship was over long before it ended, where she would be entirely out of contact with me for a few weeks. So I seized the chance to break away and did, immediately finding a new relationship in an old fling from middle school. I began dating this new girl very shortly into summer, and we stayed together all the way through the rest of high school and into the summer before college. We had a pretty good run, fights here and there, but overall it was wonderful. In the end, however, self-conscious, only to be met with disastrous results once again. To this day

Most recently, I knew going in to it that I'm prone to move at a fast pace and fall for someone quickly. And despite trying to pace myself, I still fell for her in a fairly rapid (3ish months?) frame of time, during which she didn't. When it all finally came out, we tried to continue things on a day-to-day basis to see if he would come around. She didn't, and upon hearing this, I explained that I couldn't be friends with someone I was in love with and didn't feel the same way about me. After yet another disastrous fight

And that's really it for my relationships, and all around genuine character. I'm not an asshole, I'm always myself, which is a sarcastic, gentlemanly, hopeless romantic. And I don't pressure the girl to feel anything for me. But they never do anyways.

I am having trouble trusting my boyfriend. Today I almost snooped through his contacts. That was super shitty of me. I stopped myself before I did or saw anything. It's completely wrong of me and I feel awful for even trying

I wanted to look for evidence that he is talking to a female friend of his behind my back. He had phased out contact with her a few months ago

Some backstory about this ""friend"" of his: She has clearly always had feelings for him, so if he wants me back he has to cut off contact with her. I am just so tired of her being a constant stress in my life as she keeps trying to butt her way into his. He agreed to that and here we are.

**Here are the points I'm thinking about:**

* **1: I logically understand I should not have to snoop even if something is wrong.** Relationships need trust

* 2: We had a very rocky patch in our relationship two years ago. During this time, but **sometimes if he doesn't handle something the way I would, I think it means he doesn't care enough to consider my feelings or that he is hiding something even if he is not.**

* 3: I am insecure when it comes to feeling loved. I need a pretty constant amount of affection and assurance or I start to get really sad or paranoid. I have always been like this in relationships. **I am very high-maintenance and have always been this way. I've only recognized it to be a bad thing with my current boyfriend because the guys I dated in the past let me walk all over them.** My boyfriend does not which is a big part of why I am attracted to him

* 4: **I grew up in a very stable and loving home

**TL;DR: I am insecure and don't fully trust my boyfriend. Almost snooped to try and find evidence of him talking with a ""friend"" who likes him, loving home; don't know why I am so paranoid in relationships (not just this one) about whether or not my boyfriend loves me.**

1337099555.0,toed0,reconciling the emotional baggage from a past relationship..,,7,1,1,"23F and 25M(s)


My past relationship was nightmarish. Of course there were beautiful aspects to it, he'd remain quiet about it and would often deal with his spousal frustrations by hitting up other women on facebook or shooting girls he was just ""friendly"" with flirty text messages. I was there for him unconditionally -- when he was sick, depressed, whatever -- but he could never return the favor. I often felt like I was a burden, like I was never really wanted by him, and this took a huge emotional toll on me. I disregarded, one might even say ignored


Towards the end of our relationship, claiming that he was still unsure of whether he wanted a part in our relationship. I allowed myself to be pulled back and forth by him -- he took me out to dinner on Valentine's Day (we weren't dating) and then a couple of days later threw it in my face that we weren't in a relationship and told me I should stop being so clingy and ""crazy."" After about of month of this, I somehow empowered myself to move on and began to distance myself emotionally from him and from our relationship. I am still incredibly resentful of the way he treated me.
Since then, he even told me point blank that he did) -- we've been on dates, had great conversations, he wanted to hold my hand at breakfast the other morning.. But part of me is so emotionally damaged from my past relationship that I keep waiting for this new guy to turn on me, so to speak.


If I don't hear from him one day, ""Oh, he must have changed his mind about things."" I know that this is completely irrational. He's only ever been kind to me and has only ever indicated to me that he's interested in and respects me, but I still feel so much unwarranted anxiety about the situation. I constantly question his interest in me and, moreover, I constantly doubt that his actions are sincere (even though I'm sure they are). The point is.. I think my past relationship really fucked up my confidence and, more importantly


Can anyone offer some advice on how to let go of this emotional baggage? Not just for the sake of this current situation I'm in with this great guy, super caring, and generous, but I'm worried that everything I've gone through will compromise any relationships I try to develop in the future. I have zero self-confidence. How can I start to get it back? How can I learn to trust others again?


Any advice is appreciated.

Here is my problem--I'm averse to going somewhere far away from my hometown. I do live on campus at my current institution, rural town environment compared to my large population center of a hometown). While there are a handful of (admittedly suitable) graduate school options in or close to my hometown, I know I need to expand my geographic horizons to find the best possible program. And since grad school is competitive in this day and age, I can't bank on getting into those close-by programs.


The other side of this issue is that I feel abnormal because I'm not willing to get up and go without a second thought as so many of my peers are. Perhaps this stems from the difficulty I have integrating and finding a place for myself in a social situation--especially a completely new one. It seems to get more difficult for me every year, but I can't see the few friends that I have making an honest effort to keep in touch even if I hold up my end of the ""deal"". My SO won't follow me, which adds to my anxiety.

1336229559.0,t8dfb,Can you guys give me a healthy dose of perspective? I live way too much in my own head.,doseofperspective,6,1,1,"Hi ho reddit. I need some help on a few things.

**1.** ***I'm still in love with somebody I shouldn't be*** 

Pretty much, would hang out every day (on days that weren't uni days, he'd drive to my place to see me), and we kept in constant contact and told each other everything. In terms of things we had in common/sense of humor/personality, we were soulmates. In the end, I fell in love with him, and it seemed he had feelings for me too. 

Suddenly, but he blows it off with 'I'm busy'. I keep pushing (as something about that answer seemed off to me - he'd never been 'too busy' before) and he then says ""I didn't expect to be able to talk to you as much as I have, but I have to focus on other things now, so please leave me alone"". I decided to give him space after that. During this time of giving him space, I noticed him talking to his ex more (on facebook) and also saw that he was playing a lot of video games in his free time. This wouldn't have bothered me at all normally (as I'm an avid gamer myself) except that he claimed he was too busy to even have a short conversation with me, yet apparently he had plenty of time for video games. I still thought ""yeah, ok, and then left to speak to other people. This was a far cry from how he'd treated me before. I realized that his feelings for me must have changed

Every day, and I would think 'well, better not press the matter'. We never once fought. Never said a harsh word to each other. He would always end conversations by saying ""we should catch up some time"" but would never go beyond that. If I called him out on something, he would either ignore it or tell me that he was busy. He never tried to get to the root of any problem. And because of this, I thought he was still interested in and cared about me, even when he wasn't and didn't. This is also the reason I have found it so incredibly difficult to move on. Because we never really argued, I keep thinking ""I should have just waited it out! Maybe he would've come around and things would've been like they were"". Everyone I've spoken to has told me that this probably wouldn't happen - that his neglect and avoidance spoke for itself, it's not like we made a commitment to each other. However, even when I know I shouldn't/don't want to.

**2.** ***I fear that I will never have another chance at love.***

Yes

**3.** ***I have developed atrocious self-esteem***

The guy I have previously mentioned made me realize things I need to change about myself. He was absolutely wonderful, but since it doesn't come naturally to me, I feel like I'm failing every day. I also can't help but think about that guy and what he is doing right now. I imagine him succeeding at things and being perfectly satisfied with his life (as I'm sure he is) and I get angry at myself for continuing to pine over him. All it does is upset me. The best revenge is living well, but I just can't seem to manage it.

Another issue is (again) dating. Back when I had self esteem, and I seem to have lost that. I really need it back. 

**TL;DR** Met a guy who eventually removed himself from my life.I fear that I will never get over him or that I will never find somebody as well suited for me as he was.

I'll try to be brief: I'm 22 and male.

I came from an emotionally abusive household. Growing up

My first (and thus far, she and I started to get much more physical and much more serious. Seeing as how sex before marriage was bad and evil where we came from, and we loved each other as much as 17 and 18 year holds could, we were seriously talking about getting married, and since I was already enlisting, I figured things were pretty much set.
We ended up having sex anyway, I signed my papers and got.my ship date. 10 days after that, she broke.up with me.
needless to say, I was devastated.

I shipped out to Basic Training in October that same year. I thought I could handle it, lack of support, and the complete loss of faith in the current mission of the US Military, I completely broke.
I tried to kill myself about a month in, the other BPD), and sent home.

I spent a good 18 months unemployed

last summer, which at the time for me I didn't think would be an issue. Turned out it was. I ended up falling pretty hard for her, and things ended very quickly. Chalked it up to experience; I guess I'm not an open relationship kind of person.

Fast Forward about 9 months to early April of this year. met a girl online, did everything but actual sex. got the ""lets just be friends"" bomb dropped on me after that. I cut contact and we haven't spoken since then. I've not been dealing with that too well, honestly. I've been really depressed over the last week or so since that happened. I thought I actually had a shot at something real, but then I got a nope.avi thrown at me IRL.


I guess I've said all of that to say this:

I've got a diagnosis of a personality disorder. These things don't just ""go away"". They take years of intense therapy. Meds don't really help. I don't notice a huge difference between being off and on them

I get very attached to relationships very quickly. I just want to feel loved, and I want to make others feel the same way. I don't ""need"" a relationship, but I really want one. My family and friends aren't... enough, I guess. I know my family loves me very much, but it just feels really impersonal, and my friends are scattered all over the world; there aren't really any local to me. I feel pretty isolated out here.

I am a 25 year old guy. I'd describe myself as good looking

I am single for 3 years now. Since then I had some affairs and one night stands. It has died off for about half a year.
After being single for a year I had been open to a new relationship.
There have been some opportunities - for example with some of those affairs or just new women.

I shut them all down. Mostly because I did not really think they were my type
I also found myself thinking about almost everything they said or did.
Telling myself they I could not stand that particular behaviour in a relationship.
This is my overall situation.


1.  I have met a girl at my work right now. **(first red flag for me!)**.
- She is overweight - and to be honest - that is usually not the person I'd date. (Again don't want to sound cocky but I think I have be sexually attracted to the other person) **(2nd red flag)**.
- She neither is doing any sports nor playing games. My two biggest hobbies **(3rd red flag)**
- She is almost mostly interested in soaps and other tv shows. No real interest in politics or generell things happening **(4th red flag)**
- I don't know if she is open minded **(5th red flag)**


Now for my other thoughts:

1.  There have been successfull relationships with a person at work - also I'm not bound to work there for the rest of my life. I may be that I will be in another position in the next 3 years.

- . I feel kinda attracted to her. We had some sexual talking and I could've seen myself having great sex with her.

3.+5: There have been times where she asked me about my hobbies and other times where she teased or taunted me. So I am not sure about those. I am just thinking that I need some similarities with her. And I need to have the ability to talk with her intellectually. Maybe I could

4.: I feel like that might be the point of view of a lot of women.

I am 25 years old... far from having the need to get married and have my last relationship.
So reddit pls tell me. Am I overthining way too much? Am I too picky and demanding too much?
Do I need to just try something? Do I need to let go of certain views?

Or is it correct to have that many principles and try to find the right woman which fullfills them all?

**TL;DR: Being single for 3 years. Having opportunities to get into a relationship. Shutting them all down because I think those women don't fit my way of life.
Do I need to fullfill all my standards or do I have to let go of some and just try it because life is too short?**

As a result, because I'm apparently virtually expressionless. She also gets a little uncomfortable by my approach to some of our discussions. As an example:

My current girlfriend is bisexual. Not a problem for me. When I told her that I didn't care if she wanted to pursue intimacy with women as well

*Her: 'I can't have sex with somebody else. That would be cheating!'*

*Me: ""Having sex with a woman is different then doing so with a man. I understand and accept this. You like both. I likewise accept and understand this. It's inevitable that you'll eventually want to sleep with another girl or girls. I can either accept that now and provide a solution that prevents it from causing tension later

*Her

*Me: 'Of course it does. But if you want to badly enough you will anyway

*Her: 'So do you expect me to tell you about it?'*

*Me: 'That's your business. It might be better if you didn't; I don't really know.'*

It boils down to this:

So here’s what ails me. My issue stems from the fact that I’m a 21 year old dude and never had a meaningful relationship. Let me clarify – I had one long distance (met her in high school, at least in my estimation. You never actually learn anything about the person, and when you do get to spend time together, every interaction is forced, as if you have to be happy with that person while you have the chance. Anyway, point is I don’t count that one. 

 Yes, at least not yet. However I AM looking for something.

Anyway – here’s the issue. I seem to be failing everywhere I look and I don’t know why. This isn’t a plea to pity - I feel like I have a lot to offer girls. I work out a ridiculous amount, and I like to think that I can be pretty thoughtful. I can even be pretty smooth sometimes. But somehow, despite my best efforts, I’m still single, and I have been most of my entire life. And it’s starting to get into my head. 

I have a somewhat addictive personality, but when it comes to this, no amount of thinking can help. I see my friends with all this drama happening in their life, I juxtapose it with my own, fairly empty one, and I enter this spiral where I think and think and think and wonder and wonder and wonder what I can be doing wrong. I can come up with no conclusion other than that I am somehow cursed, somehow damned
Now I know all this is bullshit. The real problem lies in that this cripples my confidence, where I can’t get a ladyfriend because I don’t have any confidence, and I don’t have any confidence because I don’t have a ladyfriend.

Is there anything I can do other than just wait it out, rather than just sitting around waiting for something that may never happen without a push.

I turned into a rage monster who would punch things and send her 50 emails a day begging for her back or I will kill myself. That's hyperbole

So about two years later, and I really liked her. I ask her to hang out twice more which she doesn't follow through with, but she tells our friends she likes me. A month later she starts dating someone else and takes care to remind everyone of his superiority to everyone else she's ever know, which I felt was directed at me. I experienced a Vietnam flashback and began punching my floor. I come to the conclusion that she must have never liked me and only led me on to hurt my feelings. So I do the reasonable thing and make a fake profile of my sister to ask her through it why she did those things. I didn't feel confident enough to ask her myself, and was extremely afraid of being hurt more than I already was. She contacts me on my real account to call me a fucking idiot a few times and hurt me more than I already was. Eventually she figures out my sister and I are the same person and stops talking to me, and tells all our friends so they stop talking to me too, which I probably deserved. At this point I felt reasonably confident in my ability to kill myself. I tell that to a friend I still had, and I say yes because I want her to know this feel for some dumb fucking reason. She tells the school and a bunch of her friends

I tried to have like two other relationships after that

I typically think of how terrible my love life has been 4 or 5 times a day, and I have trouble getting and keeping an erection. I'm almost totally apathetic to forming a romantic relationship with anyone, I just think it's too hard to trust anyone and put the effort into a relationship when they're just going to be a jerk anyways. Sometimes I think about starting a relationship just to break it off in a really cruel way, I guess as a form of revenge. Other times I just wish my ex and that other one would call me or something to just say they're sorry. This morning I woke up wishing for an apology, and I thought if I ever made anyone feel shitty I'd try to apologize for it. So I sent a message on Facebook to a girl who obviously liked me but I ignored/made fun of because I was depressed as fuck and all my friends put it in her butt. I felt really bad about just sort of disapproving of her existence, so I thought at the very least I could tell her I was sorry incase there was anything bothering her like there was bothering me. She told me she didn't know who I was, that she already had a boyfriend and blocked me. So I guess she wasn't really bothered.

We began the relationship on bad footing. It was an amazing, but I had come straight from a 4 year relationship that had crumbled, straight to this girl. Yes, I know this wasn't the *best* idea looking back on it, but what can I say, I let myself get carried away by happy, romantic feelings.


The first signs of my insecurities began to show their ugly head when I stupidly questioned her faithfulness to me in a massive display of mistrust, not, at the time, 3 months. As our relationship continued, my insecurities continued to eat me up inside in that self-destructive way that they do. I convinced myself that she had ulterior motives with me, that she was using me for money, that she would find someone better looking and more interesting than me. I believed I wasn't good enough for her.


The way these insecurities manifested themselves would mostly be through anger. Inevitably a minor dispute would allow me to explode with all of these internal insecurities and completely blow up. I would say the most incredibly vicious things to her. Horrible


I also, a talent I unfortunately don't have. 


The silly thing is, all these points that I mention are a few of the reasons I love her so much. I love her passion for life and her interests. I love exploring her interests, her loves and her hates, her opinions and her knowledge. Our passions do cross over as well, a lot. So it's not like I can have justification to feel insecure about a few differences in interests. 


Another thing worth noting - I feel I see her imperfections, for some reason her blind confidence got to me in a big way. It's as though I needed her to be less confident. I needed her to acknowledge some faults for my own sanity. This feels like a very emotionally ugly need, one that I'm very ashamed of.


These insecurities quickly found their way into the bedroom as well. Here is a girl with whom I was exploring the best love making of my life. A sexual connection like no other I've ever had. This should have been one of the most interesting and explorative parts of our relationship together, baseless emotions dogged much of it. Much of the same emotions - feelings of inadequacy, comparing myself to others and feeling a lot of intimidation by her own sexual awareness.


These insecurities aren't just confined to relationships with girls. I've had them with friends as well. I worry that friends who I like the most couldn't possibly like me. I wonder if I'm annoying and insignificant. I think this may be why I'm far more comfortable meeting people for the first time than forming long-term relationships - I just can't imagine people would like me when they get to know me. It effects every part of my life and I'm aware of how it holds me back in so many parts of my life


I'm unsure of where these insecurities come from. I can't pinpoint them to specific experiences. A very brief summary of significant past events that may or may not be have played a part in who I am today..


* As a child of 7

* Elementary school was dogged by bullying and loneliness. 

* High School was tough, cystic acne infested teen. I would chose to be alone when I could and often missed a lot of school.


I'm outwardly confident in social situations though - I normally hold conversation well, I know I'm a decent looking guy and I'm in a good, high paying profession. I am also very well travelled and a fairly intelligent and knowledgable guy. I should really be an over confident person if anything.


I'm trying to stay away from self-pity, beautiful, interesting girl. She was loving, open, intelligent and fun. Someone who I should have only ever been sharing an explorative time of my life with, shared mutual loves and passions, someone who I should have been enjoying and savouring every moment with. Instead


Underneath all the nonsense, I've simply had to accept that I have lost something amazing and it is purely through my own fault. I can't change what I've done but I can try my best to prevent it from happening again. I would like to be able to go into a relationship as a confident person who will only show love and nurture for all these amazing qualities that my partner has, not develop a fierce insecurity and needs that are impossible to satisfy. I want to be an emotionally strong person. I don't want to be someone who has to be with a weak, unstimulating partner to make myself feel secure. I recognize that quality as something negative, incredibly selfish and unhealthy. I need to shake off these ugly attributes. I want to be a very confident person. I want to have healthy relationships. I'm eager to explore my sexuality with someone I love and explore the person I love without these incredible feelings of self doubt and unworthiness. I want to express the genuine love I feel for someone, without needing the feelings of approval and reassurance. Most of all, I don't want to find myself hurting someone I love ever again. Ever.

In reality, so in the past few years I've become more and more risk averse. It's not affecting my daily activities per-se, I just tend to not want to do anything new. It affects really weird areas of my life, like I won't play online games because I'm scared that the nameless and faceless people I play with or against will think less of me. It puts strain on my friendships because I'm afraid to go and hang out, especially with people I don't know. I never go out alone. I'm sure it's some kind of social anxiety, but I've always been too embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. I'm not very fit or good looking, although I'm working on getting back in shape. I know I can (my first two years of college I was very fit... depression killed that for the next two years), and I'm still a virgin. I've always been interested in girls

I know I should be excited about my future and all of the possibilities, and recently met back up. We've gone out as friends, and it's been awesome. Which is part of the problem; she's such an awesome friend to me that I'm afraid to ask her if she'd be willing to try dating. Part of me is screaming ""GO FOR IT! TAKE THE SHOT!"" while the rest of me is saying (what I feel to be logically), ""Look at yourself. You're lucky she even talks to you. Don't ruin what you already have. Greed corrupts you."" It's like I can't turn off that part of my brain that keeps telling me to proceed cautiously and avoid making mistakes. I know I NEED to mess up in order to learn and experience, but it's like self preservation is keeping me from trying. 

So... how do you turn off a part of you that you've relied on to help you make decisions all of your life? Do I have a bigger problem than just my aversion to risk? Is there something I'm missing? Should I just wait it out and ""get better?"" Or is that logical part of me doing me more favors than I realize?

1325086548.0,ntnjv,Terrified of making my father’s mistakes in love,Wellthatsnice290,7,2,6,"26M. Hello Reddit

The last years I have noticed while dating girls, I feel a resentment building up. I feel myself standing ready to detect any signs of being criticized, and then feel hurt about it. 

But I do not start any arguments, or will invalidate my feelings, and I freeze up, I am paralyzed, and I bottle up my feelings. When that happens, I lose my attraction to the girl I am dating.

This reddit made me start thinking about the underlying causes. I think that it has something to do with my parents. My mother has always made all the decisions in our household, and felt that I had to protect him. I felt I had to address my mother about this, and sometimes I did, but it never worked out, because my mother would feel herself a victim and my father would get angry because he didn’t want my help. 

At times I am boggled by my father’s choices in life. At how he is frustrated and stressed out all the time. And somehow he seems to take it out on me and my brother by saying we are screw-ups every other day. I never knew whether to protect him or be angry at him. Because if I started to argue with him for being unkind, and I would feel sorry for him.

I very well know that I am not a screw-up. I have a great education and a job and a fantastic group of close friends, but I am also scared of ending up in a relationship similar to that of my parents. I would never accept to be in a relationship like the one my father is in. But I do not really know how to... avoid it. In my dating life I am usually drawn towards shy girls because they seem more considerate, but girls themselves are not the problem. My emotions are; they are not reasonable. I can always manage to find fault in a girl, but I know that I do this because I am afraid to get invalidated in a relationship, like my father is all the time, and not being able to live like I want to. 

Do you have any advice for me

When I was a shy, and we began chatting (on AIM) and eventually developed a wonderful friendship. We never talked all that often (every few weeks or so), but whenever we did, it felt great. I was probably depressed as a teenager and having a good looking, charming guy who was a couple of years older (he was just out of high school when we started talking) listen to a lonely nerd girl me felt like the best thing in the world. Furthermore, our conversations always had a slightly flirtatious edge to them, which boosted my self-esteem even more. As time passed, I organized the trip mostly to visit him

The weeks prior to our meeting, with anyone) with him. There was no intercourse, but it was the first time I was even naked with a guy. Moreover, it was consensual, and I don’t regret it at all. When I was naked, he told me – with a tone of genuine surprised satisfaction – that I have a “great body.” I’d always buried myself in loose-fitting androgynous clothes (I was a bit of a tomboy, as well as very shy)

Anyway, another time earlier this year – I had intercourse for the first time ever with him during the latter), but in between we (I?) got into an intense amateur porn routine. I sent him videos of me touching myself, and I loved hearing him talk about my body. Frankly, I enjoyed doing it, but deep down I think I had the hope that this would somehow bring him closer to me in a physical (as opposed to a virtual, internet) sense.

This would require a whole other messy write-up, we no longer flirt (in conversation or through media). But we still talk. 

I think having this friendship dominate my emotional (and sexual?) life for so long (I never dated or had sex with anyone else until very recently) has messed me up in a lot of ways. But most significantly, feel like shit and tell myself I won’t do it again, but then I will later in the week. I know I’m clearly not fat and that I’m even still a little underweight (I’m a very petite young woman with a slender/curvy balance), but something’s off somewhere with me. Most of all, I think of my friend’s on/off girlfriend (now girlfriend!). To me, she’s the one he “chose” to have a relationship with, and all I can think about is the superficial – how tall and slender she is. 

How do I begin to heal? From the unhealthy body image issue and from giving so much of myself to a delusion in the first place?

I recently transferred colleges.

It was really only in my last semester there that I found a small group of four or five people I really enjoyed spending time with. I still see them from time to time, and they're still good friends, but when I look back on how much time and effort I put into all of those other people- and how little I have to show for it now- it makes me feel sad.

My last relationship ended at the beginning of October.  I was the one who ended it

Basically, because as a serial monogamist, of course I've experienced longterm relationships with intense periods of discord without as much collateral damage as I feel I received from what should have been a bit of ""harmless fun"".  

I knew

I knowingly put myself through the process of allowing this guy to consistently disrespect not just me, an alcoholic, and an unemployed ne'er-do-well.  I suspected these things about him before we started dating, confirmed them while were dating, and eventually ended the relationship after I started feeling so worthless that I was having a hard time holding it together emotionally at work.  I certainly don't need to graphically describe in great detail all of his many shortcomings, but if you'd like to know more about that relationship, I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/krk2a/im_getting_too_old_to_invest_in_something_with_so/) plea for help during the sunset period of our time together

Tom moved out of my home and shortly afterward set up camp on a local Occupy site.  That seems all well and good, and he's pissed off his rich parents so much that he can never go home, and all of his friends know better than to take him in -- and as an opportunist of the lowest moral quality, I guess he's decided that a movement that regularly receives donations of food and toiletries (and sometimes even booze and cigarettes) from our community is the perfect place to squat until he finds someone else to take advantage of.  He stayed with me rent-free all summer, even after I hooked him up with a job through an old work contact, which he promptly lost right after we broke up.  He's fucking useless, and that's a fact.

So, I don't even feel motivated to date at all.  This is the first time in years that I've had zero prospects -- and it's not because I couldn't find them if I looked, it's just that I can't even summon the energy or willpower to look -- and I guess I have to admit that I'm willfully blinding myself to anyone who has expressed a romantic interest in me lately as well.

I don't know why I put myself through that mess with that guy.  I don't know why I was smart enough to realize he was a leech and still somehow *needed* to go through the process of being with him, ""NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.""  the *entire* time.  The sex wasn't as fantastic as he wanted to pretend it was for me, he was slightly lacking in the hygiene area, you know... I'm just baffled.

I don't feel like things are getting better for me with time.  I'm a lot busier now, about things related to the break-up... I have a female friend, Karen, for whom I was a friggin' *rock* during her break-up and I ended up setting her up with my most eligible male friend while I was dating Tom.  After Tom and I broke up, she was ""there"" for me for the space of a fifteen-minute-long phone call and since then, all I get are random messages from her that she ""misses me"" and ""we need to do something"", but whenever I contact her to solidify plans, I'm mad about that.

I don't snap about day-to-day inconveniences or anything, even my best friend of over a decade.  I can't shake the feeling that people are judging me and wish me harm, and in turn, sometimes I unhealthily indulge in these bouts of negativity.  I hope Tom is miserable.  I'm not involved with the Occupy movement at all -- something I would otherwise be all about -- just because I'm so resentful of it for providing a circumstance for Tom to continue living as a parasite... and now he can hide behind having a ""cause"" and justify his lifestyle.  I hope
Karen gets dumped and has no one to bolster her self-esteem.  I fantasize about seducing her boyfriend

Whereas a lot of the people close to me would describe me as incredibly forgiving, a better person, that I no longer am.

My question is how to avoid becoming infatuated with new people. The ideal is that I'd meet someone, and then have my feelings gradually increase over time. As it is, I've recently met someone. I've known him for a few months, but suddenly I'm thinking about him very often. In the morning, even, when there's no reason to think about him at all. We talk for an hour or so every day online. I'm beginning to think it's unhealthy, I don't want to be so attached to him already. 

The thing is, both of which appeal to me. But if I hadn't met him, I'm sure I'd be infatuated with someone else, instead. It feels like I have this need to have a crush on a guy, all the time. Only 2 weeks ago I was thinking how happy I was being single, how nice it was not to have to deal with drama/men/heartbreak whatever.

I guess the reason I've started this thread is I feel like the only person in the world like this. It's something I don't have the confidence to talk to my family about. They think I'm a pretty confident person, but I don't feel anything when I look at them or other people. I don't get sparks of attraction like other people do or understand why people turn others on. It's not just looks either, it includes once I've gotten to know them.


I've even gone down the avenue of wondering if I was gay, but have never felt the desire to have sex with another person, or deal with the sex drive in a non-solo fashion.


I have had sex once, and wouldn't be able to explain it.


What do I do? I'm scared because I don't want to be alone and I don't know how to explain this to other people, though I've always told my parents that I don't want any (which I think I did so they would be prepared for me not having any).

I am a 23 years old and am currently in a somewhat happy relationship with my girlfriend.  We do not have sex often (once a week MOST) but are somewhat happy with each other.  

6 months before we started dating I just had gotten out of my first relationship that lasted about 10 months with a girl that I went to high school with and we dated while we were sophomores in college (went to same school). I broke up with my ex gf because I was not particularly happy in the relationship. These two girls know each other and things went pretty smoothly when my ex found out who my new gf was.   

Heres where things get tricky... we were in sort of the same social group in college and we would often all be in the same setting at bars and at parties.  There were a few times where me and my ex ended up by ourselves and did nothing more than simple flirting.  The furthest it ever went was making out one time for a few minutes while I was on a very small (few day) break with my current gf.  about a year has past since the time we made out.  Since then about once a month either me or her initiate conversation via text message when we are drunk (75% me, I think.  My ex (who is has been in a so-so relationship for 2 years but am pretty sure she has feeling for me as well) still lives near my hometown and I am about 100 miles away living in the same town as my current gf.

My girlfriend of almost 3 years dumped me after this last summer vacation ended (she took a 3 week trip back to her home after her internship ended). I know some people will throw around the phrase ""out of the blue, it was how I imagine being laid off from a job would be. Other memorable quotes are ""I just don't see the point of having sex with only you knowing it's going to end in a year,"" and ""well I haven't been with that many people."" I don't remember exactly how it was worded but she said she wanted to still be friends with benefits with me. I refused.

It's been a crappy time trying to get over her, and it's very obvious what she's been looking to do, and that has made me feel worse.

So fast forward to 2 nights ago. I don't know what got into me but I took her up on her offer. I thought maybe just a one-nighter kind of thing would help me feel better, but now I'm completely confused. The sex we had wasn't the semi-callous doing whatever turned us on sex that I thought it'd be, it was insanely passionate love-making, ranked among the best we've ever had (I'm one of the romantics that distinguishes between sex and making love), during which I could tell from the feel that she hadn't been getting laid either. But, she didn't want me to leave afterwards, she tried to get me to cuddle and was kissing me non-stop

So here's the source of my confusion. We're both new to the concept of sex-buddies but I'm pretty damn sure that's now how things are supposed to go. She tries to treat me like a friend in public (the 2 times we've seen each other in public)

For me, and because of that I don't want to stop, but I don't think it's a good idea to keep going along with the emotional things she wants to do in addition, like cuddle or hang out afterwards.

I was in a relationship for 7.5 years.  We were together from 14 to 22 and things were up and down.  But I did love him.  He was my first everything, particularly since mid September of this year.

In that 8-9 month period, had a one night stand, hooked up with girl (cheated on him again since we were actually working on things), and got involved with a man in a LTR.  I am very disappointed in myself and all of my actions have made me question love as a concept.  How could I hurt someone (my ex) so badly if I loved him?  How could someone who said they loved their girlfriend get so involved (physcially and emotionally) with me?  How could I get involved with someone knowing they ""loved"" another? What do I actually value about love?

On top of all this, I was unnecessarily dramatic a lot of the time because in my head I thought that fighting was a part of love since that's what I grew up with.  (I know better now).

My dad committed suicide a few years ago (his business had failed and he saw it as the last thing he could do to protect my family from ruin) and this has also left me struggling to figure out love.  I don't know.  It just has stopped making sense to me.  I knew what it felt like to ""be in love"" with my ex-boyfriend.  But I don't know what love is to me now.

1320916389.0,m791j,(18/F) Feeling insecure and paranoid that my boyfriend might leave me.,insecure-throwaway,6,1,6,"I used to be pretty independent and somewhat confident but recently I’ve been doubting myself and feeling more and more insecure

We’ve been dating for around 2 months but have been officially together for 1. We are both freshmen in college and neither of us has had a serious relationship before. He told me rather soon after we met that before me, it sort of took me by surprise. At the time I wasn’t ready to say it back but eventually I did about a week later.

The fact is that he is good-looking, I’m terrified that he could just dump me at any moment for another girl. It’s as if I don’t feel good enough for him. Just last night I dreamt that I caught him cheating on me.

It’s frustrating because my friends tell me I’m a great friend, I’m somewhat intelligent, have good hygiene and generally nothing repulsive about me that might scare anyone away. Many people have also told me that I come across as much more mature than my age which is why I feel as if I’m going crazy because I’m usually clear-headed and sensible.

Part of me really wants to be in a loving committed relationship my boyfriend but another part of me wants to run as fast as I can in the opposite direction to avoid falling head over heels for him and avoid getting seriously hurt later. I haven’t talked to him about my insecurities for fear of scaring him away. I also make a conscious effort to not come across as a jealous

Some part of my insecurities might be due to my parents’ messy divorce. My parents were married for about 20 years until my mom found out last year that my dad had been cheating on her with multiple women for the past 5 years (and possibly even longer). I think  having to console my distraught mom about how my dad didn’t give a shit about her could have caused me to be wary about serious relationships and question commitment a lot. I’ve also seen a few close friends get hurt badly in relationships recently.

Apologies for the terribly long ramble.

TL;DR - Insecure and paranoid about being dumped by wonderful boyfriend and getting hurt.

Am I going crazy? Is there something wrong with me? How can I overcome this overwhelming insecurity and just generally feel more comfortable with everything? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Following reasons why I had to cut off our friendship:

1. We shared the same nationality, beliefs and philosophy on life we were different... explained further...

2. He grew up in a strict household, even though he used to always tell me he wanted to leave the house ASAP.

3. His father was a former government agent in the middle east (can't disclose nationality for privacy reasons)

So in conclusion his family was a danger to mine. But I can't deny that we shared some good times together

So should I say something on his Facebook wall? Ever since I cut it off our friendship hes been confused and extremely pissed. We live far away from each other so it hasn't been hard ignoring him. I feel extremely awkward saying anything to him even on Facebook, I have my own life. But all those years we spent together as kids can't be erased, right now I am planning to continue ignore him even though it's heart wrenching, is it the right thing to do?

I'm 21 and female

Brief history for background: I've always been reserved and awkward and had trouble making friends. I tend to form really intense friendships with one or two people and don't really have any casual friends. The trouble is after a year or so of extremely close friendship I start to realize my friends are domineering and manipulative and I feel frequently attacked for doing or saying anything the friend doesn't like or agree with. Eventually I'm told I've changed, with my oldest childhood/teenage friend and with my current best female friend (we've been close for 4/5 years.) 

Early in 2010 I broke up with my then-boyfriend of 3 years who I had a very consuming but crappyI relationship with but sadly decided to cling to because I didn't want to be alone. It felt so good to be free and I had no other relationships to focus on so I spent tons of time with F and M, smoked lots of trees (and tried some new drugs as well) and just generally went crazy and had fun. I sluttted it up quite a bit which DROVE F TO TEARS because this was so strange and offensive to her that she ""didn't know who I was anymore."" She said she wasn't sure if we could even be friends, what was I thinking,  etc etc. I was really hurt but didn't want to lose a friend so I ignored it and she got overit. 
The summer of debauchery takes its toll on M , full time student with a part time job, get stuck paying all ir most of the rent and utilities and we are without water or electricity towardsa the end of our lease because im too embarrasses to ask anyone for help. 

Then in the fall of last year I met my current (awesome) boyfriend who encourages me to be more responsible, all things normally considered positive changes in a persons life but which my friends take as a personal affront. They accuse me of judging them when I turn down pot or other drugs, tell me I'm neglecting them and treating them like shit because I spend most nights (and a lot of my free time, admittedly) with the new bf. Meanwhile roomie M is making only the most half assed attempts at job hunting and our apt has no running water or electricity.

I understand theirconcern over my changing my behavior because of a guy, grades, etc, and I still do a toned down version of the things I used to do with my friends. Our relationship just feels broken now and I can't get over how critical and harsh they acted instead of being happy that I found something good. M still owes me money and never offers to pay me back aside from occasionally buying my drinks if we go out. I didn't keep a record of what he owed me because I felt bad for him, he was obviously depressed and having problems with his family, but I know its at least a couple hundred dollars. 

Should I try to move on from these friendships? Do they sound toxic to you guys? My boyfriend says yes but I have no other friends and have invested so much in these... and I'm a little afraid what they've said about me is right. Please give some advice. I can offer more details if it will help

I met my boyfriend online over two years ago.  We skyped and chatted

He moved to my city and we've been living together since May of 2010. (He's 22 years old now.) After a while we began to have sex less often

After a few months of living together at one point I woke up and walked into the living room to find him masturbating.  He didn't notice me and I left the room.  When I asked him about it later he denied he'd been masturbating.

Ever since then I've had an irrational negative feeling towards porn and masturbation

I've gone into literal anxiety attacks over this. In an effort to calm me down he promised me he wouldn't look at porn (which I feel like crap about

I've talked to him about it many times but I can think of no way to fix my issues.  My rational mind constantly tells me that porn and masturbation is normal

How can I overcome how much I despise the idea of my boyfriend viewing porn and masturbating?

(Just a last note since I imagine people may recommend it: I do not like watching porn and would be very uncomfortable if we watched it together

Edited to Add for Clarification: I'm afraid in the interest of brevity I cut the issue down and may have given the wrong impression; I do not personally believe he views porn particularly often,"" such as masturbation, porn, or both at the same time.

I'm quite ""attractive"" and work as a full-time fashion model. I'm sick of nearly every gay / bi person I meet immediately trying to have sex with me. 

All I want to do is get to know like-minded

I have profiles setup on local websites other young adults use in the area. I participate in allot of local activities and have a wide circle of friends.

When-ever I meet someone hopeful I ask from the start ""what would you like to-do""? - then I play dumb to see what kind of answer they give back to me. 99% are along these lines: ""Oh ;) well I want to kiss you and hold and caress your body"". The answer I was looking for: ""I want to go for a walk with you and talk about X because we both find it interesting"".

If I tell them I'm not interested in sexual advances and just wanted to get to know someone as a friend for a long-time first they agree that is a great idea ...and then on the first or second date they are obviously trying exceedingly hard to get in my pants. Its really fucking annoying.

I present myself in-person and online as non-sexual as possible. I intentionally don't wear things that show off too much skin etc to further exuberant my problem. I can be flirty but I know where to draw the line ect. 

I had a boyfriend who was my best-friend for 4 1/2 years. He was everything to me and perfect. He died in an accident a year ago.

I feel like whenever someone says ""you will meet someone again soon"" ect

1314267295.0,jtw41,Lonely ... but can't find desire to meet / date. ,despond,6,0,5,"**TL/DR:**
Long term relationship I was 100% committed to ended roughly a year ago. 

In the following months I feel I've completely gotten over my ex. 

Tried dating a few times: hated it.

Not just the dates ... *the entire process* of meeting women and dating. 
I hate the dating *scene*. 

.

I'm lonely ... *I want to be with someone*.  (No interest in casual sex.)

But I can't muster the time and effort required for the process I don't seem to enjoy.   
I also feel like this bad feeling about dating in general is going to sabotage any efforts I do make. 

It seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
If I don't enjoy dating in general then how could I even HAVE a good date?

-------

**Long version:**

A lot of background to cover because I suspect it's important:

Straight male

During the final year of that relationship I noticed a personal change ... my brain ***locked*** into the relationship.  I was completely happy

And that was exactly what I wanted. 



Fast-forward a few months later:
The relationship is suddenly dying ... she's distant ... alarm bells going off ... etc.

I confront her about it and this seems to be the tipping point.  

Facing her behavior

All of my plans and expectations come falling down like a house of cards. 



Fast-forward just a little more and I discover she's dating one of my friends.
A friend who she had been hanging out with a lot towards the end of our relationship. 

I don't know if she cheated or not ... but at this point I think it's wasted energy to even think about it.

The relationship is over. 



It takes me a while to be confident that I was completely over her but I get there.

No romantic interest left

.

After about 5-6 months I tried meeting women and dating again. 

It was a disaster. 

.

I hated it ... every part of it.  

On the dates I went on I ended up pretending to have fun just so I didn't make them feel bad. 

I just didn't feel into it.  I didn't *care*. 

.

Worst Instance:
Over the course of three dates ... 

(I was trying to force myself to open up with a girl that should have been a good fit.)

... the vibes I got from one girl went from *""I'm waiting for you to jump me.""* to *""I resent you for not making the slightest move.""*
In the end I ended up feeling like an ass for wasting so much of her time. 

.

And it's more than just bad dates.
I feel jaded about the whole process of meeting women. 
Everything about dating sites just feels fake ... no one is honest about anything. 
I hate the whole ... *bar* ... thing.  I have no desire to go buy drinks for the opportunity to make pointless smalltalk with a woman that is either there for a one night stand or to get free drinks. 

.

So

Unfortunately

*I work in an environment with no women under the age of 40. 

*I don't have any opportunities to meet women in my normal routine.

*I would feel too awkward to randomly approach someone at the store or something.   (Is that even socially acceptable?  In the real world outside of romantic comedies it seems like a good way to be labeled creepy.)

***How can I meet someone like this?***
 
I did run into *one* girl I would have loved to date.
A friend from college who I had actually been interested in years ago.  Now she works very close to where I live. 
We chatted several times and we have have very similar interests so my head was in the clouds.
TBH let myself get too excited even though I knew better. 
It's just ... at the time it seemed like the perfect girl showed up in the perfect place at the perfect time.  

She turned me down of course.  

.

So ... I'm now in a place where I feel like I'm left with no options to meet women outside of the the *dating scene* which I absolutely don't enjoy.  And


Any advice?

1313314580.0,jid8b,"I'm 27, a virgin and never been in a relationship, and this leads to anxiety that perpetuates this condition.  ",vigrin,6,5, which leads to more anxiety

Sorry, although a few best friends know about 75% of it (I have so much anxiety about the whole relationship thing I can't even tell my best friends everything)

So, but I didn't have much friends in that time period.  I didn't hang out with anyone my age between 9th and 11th grades.  I  eventually made a few friends and the few friends that left town right after high school.  Needless to say, I didn't date in high school.

My first first real date I actually had was a girl that was always friendly to me in school and I was probably too stupid to realize she was interested in me ( one of those girls when I was about 21.  She liked me, we had fun, and she was cute.  She came over to a party at my house.  She tried to kiss/make out with me when she was really drunk (I was sober), and I was like freaking out again, and didn't do anything back, and she just left the room.  (I saw her 4 months after that and she was 3 months pregnant, and engaged to some other guy I found out she was dating at the same time

Fast forward past college graduation, and I think I love her, but I don't want to get hung up on either, so I just try to move on, but it's hard because we *both* enjoy each others time.  I'm not very good at making new friends, but I'm still lonely too, so this tends to lead my toward a path of apathy towards meeting new people

This led me to Okcupid.  I had one not so great date a few months ago, talked to another girl, texted for a few days and met up for drinks.  We met at a busy (brightly lit) bar, and she brought her friend, and we drank, and she got pretty drunk.  I drank to kill anxiety.  Eventually, she apparently thought I was cute and ended up grabbing my head and shoving her tongue in my mouth, I had hover hands, then I texted a few times after trying to go to dinner actually meet this person instead of drinking

So, but I'm getting more and more anxiety of thinking about the next steps.  Part of me wants to just get it over with with some random girl I'll never see again (not a prostitute though) but given my personality I don't really see that happening.  A bigger part of me wants to find a nice girl, go on a few dates and try to explain it, but I just don't know if I can beat that anxiety, and that anxiety gets worse with time.

Anyone that knows me in real life thinks that I’m absolutely fine. I don’t like to burden others with my issues because everyone has their own problems. 

I’m 21

I grew up the youngest of four with 2 older sisters (30, pretty much perfect. Both married their high school sweet hearts, graduated from college without issues, had good grades, weren’t ever questioning of my parents, considered beautiful blah blah blah. My brother was amazing at sports, probably the best artist I’ve ever seen and is one of the laziest, what other people should be focusing on

Strangers / Family friends would always make comments about my family, how we had such a beautiful family. I just wanted to be the one complimented a few times when I was younger. 

Anyways my brother’s issues got worse

My mother never wants any of us to leave the nest, and have another baby boy on the way. He’s not working, and is still going to school (It’s only been… 8 years and he doesn’t have an associates degree.) His girlfriend isn’t much better than he is, pretty much his female counterpart. They’re awful people and I feel bad for my nephew. My parents cover everything for the two of them. 

My dad was a great father to me when I was a child but over time we never had anything to bond over and besides for him BEING my dad

Besides my family I really didn’t have many close friends growing up. All of my close friends growing up were girls and I was excluded from activities that they did because I was a boy. I just wanted friends

As such I had no friends that I could hang out with, and the times that they did I didn’t WANT them to, and I idealized my sisters, and since my family was focusing on all of my brothers issues or what minor problems my sisters had I kind of just slipped by. 

Time went on and I realized that it was just easier to lie about everything. I lied about school and friends to my family because I didn’t want my mother’s intervention, said or thought.

Teachers would complain to my parents about me not doing all my work, I just remember zoning out for most of my childhood. It was awful at home just between arguments or bickering, hassle over such trivial things. I still remember one day in 5th grade when I just counted the number of insults thrown my way during a single lunch/recess. It was over 200. 

This was my life for years. Pretty much 3rd grade through my Senior year of high school. I was socially awkward, depressed, never achieved anything in school because I was surrounded by people that didn’t care that I did know it anyways and as much as I hated my life I never would have killed myself just because I realized I could tolerate my pain for the sake of my sisters/parents. I never excelled at sports the way my brother did either. I just felt frustrated because I felt that for as awful as he was that my family genuinely loved him more.

Years passed of thinking that college would be better, I don’t know any programming languages, I can’t play an instrument, I’m self conscious about how I look. 

I feel ugly. I have a false idealization of thinking I'll only be attractive if I'm fitter and less hairy. And I feel like an even bigger idiot because as a guy I don't feel like I can ever really bring this up or even know what to do about it.

Fuck I just feel behind about everything. I don’t know how to cook

I’ve had sex twice. Both times drunk

I feel useless.

I feel like I shouldn’t have been born to be honest. I wish I hadn’t rather. I didn’t grow up in a slum

No one I know would ever think any of this is true for me. After all

To add to this mix, leaving me helpless and worried on the other side. Another instance, she threatened to hurt herself with a knife while I stood there watching in horror, not knowing what to do but to just pray to whatever entity I could think of at the time. Every time she did something like this, she'd apologize for her behaviour and say she wouldn't do it again and that she needed me. I felt like I was in a trap - being talked down on, but not being able to leave in fear that it would push her over the edge to doing something drastic to herself.

After a few months of us dating, which put an even bigger strain on our already toxic relationship. All of this built up into one occurrence of us trying to get into a club downtown that my friends were at, but with her ultimately declining when she learned my friends were inside, and me crying in the streets, wondering if there was any way out of this mess.

The following day, yelling at me and asking why I've changed so much since we first started dating. She then came to the conclusion that she had ""left the old me back in the streets of downtown"", and ran out of my apartment during wintertime (still in nothing but the bathrobe) to the bus station, asking any strangers on the way there if they had ""seen her old boyfriend"". I managed to bring her back in eventually, only to be greeted with more threats of suicide by a knife. I didn't know if she was serious about this, but I was NOT about to test her on that. This was the single most terrifying thing that has happened in my life to this day - having the feeling of truly not knowing what to do while your supposed ""girlfriend"" stands there with a knife in her hand, knowing that if I screwed up with anything that I said, she was bluffing

A few weeks later, and bit my arm in anger, a mark that would only disappear a year later. I was very happy we weren't together anymore and felt free, but I still felt a feeling of dread and worthlessness inside.

We broke up 4 years ago, but seeing her brought back the same dread and terrible memories that I've tried so hard to forget. To this day, I still feel shitty about everything. The worst part is that I actually believed her in how everything was my fault, and that it was because of me that she ended up being a psychotic nutjob. My experience with her made me lose faith in myself, making me think that I'll turn every girl I get involved with into someone like her, and that maybe I was destined to be alone.

Two, but think I've got better things to do than talk to them. Which leads me to sit there and be available, and of course they aren't always there, so if they go so long without showing up, I think I'm being avoided or don't matter enough to them for them to try and find me for 5 minutes.

It's been a couple of years since I've started trying to meet people and here's what happens:

I meet someone interesting. We click really well. He gets my sense of humour, usually at 2 - 3 months:

I get easily annoyed around him

I've been told that it's like a ""honey-moon's over"" sort of thing - but that doesn't really make sense. I was also thinking it's some intimacy issue stemming from a broken home or shitty relationship.

I've tried muscling through it -- I've tried getting some space - going away for a week, picking up a hobby that is specifically for me. I've tried to just enthusiastically throw myself back into the swing of things by doing nice and thoughtful things for him - but nothing works.

I become annoyed, it's like I can breathe again.

I'm not some heinous manipulative bitch from Hell or anything. I'm a pretty chill and upbeat person who grew up with 4 brothers. I relate to and get along better with men than I do women.

Is this a normal dating thing? Maybe I've just been striking out a whole lot and only realizing it 3 months in? I've committed before

Any advice would be appreciated. I've been seeing this one guy approaching 4 months now and I'm in a ""should I stay or should I go"" situation. There's nothing wrong with him. Really nice

I am, a person should know this about me, right? I've talked to him about it. I know y'all ain't mind-readers.

My place is your place, my food is your food, my can is your can. You ask me for permission to take a piss One More Time, I am going to punch you in the face. Just. Be. Comfortable.

Guaranteed

Fuck. And then I start thinking about the things that piss me off about these guys: Calling to say goodnight. Worrying about offending me. Rubbing my back while we watch a show. Making dinner AND doing the dishes

I think a lot of it is, don't put me on a pedestal, don't let me win at Streetfighter. When I say, ""Hey, asshole!"" It's a term of endearment and you can say ""How goes, shitface?""

I feel like I have made significant progress since my [first post on this account](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/da3x8/consumed_by_guilt_how_do_i_get_over_my_mistakes/) in coming to terms with myself and my past mistakes.  Before, things I had never imagined I could do - while in the healthiest relationship of my life.  I lost faith in myself.  I broke things off without confessing my crimes, believing it was too late to fix anything, that I was undeserving of even that relief of guilt (at his expense), that I was not ready or mature enough for a serious relationship.  At least I got things partly right.

However, stopped all the drugs, stopped going out.  Everything was bland and terrible, and all I could feel was the loss I had brought onto our lives, and the very painful fact that it was all my fault, I had broken it.  Guys used me and treated me like shit - I felt like I deserved it.  Others genuinely seemed to like me - I pushed them all away.  My friends were caring, but even the best friend can't read minds and baby you.  I isolated myself from everyone and everything... only scraping by on the bare minimum I needed to get from day to day.  I was getting ready to let go.  Every morning I woke up and thought blandly about how I could end it all.  Somewhere beneath or above it all, I knew it was a phase - it had to be because I wasn't going to live the rest of my life like this.  I would rather die.  I had also been severely depressed before twice in my life

I felt like the most worthless human being on the planet, of being wanted.  I didn't know if I could ever be normally attracted to a person again, if I could trust myself to, and I definitely didn't know if I would ever be okay enough to.

And then I took a break, and it was a good time.  I did start to come around.  The time away gave me time to reflect and make some important decisions.  Riding off the wave of this good feeling, I ended up meeting someone who made my heart flutter, just a bit, and who was totally available.  Nothing has come of it yet, but it was the spark I needed to start feeling better.  Sexual attraction was no longer my enemy.  Somewhere inside something clicked, and I felt a complete synthesis with that part of me, but how we react to them.  And it takes the bigger person to do the right thing.

But you can't do any of that without accepting the attraction is there to begin with.  It was something I had always denied in previous relationships - that I could simultaneously be attracted to another person, knowing exactly what it was because I am naive and confided in them as if we were friends.  In many ways I feel it takes a malicious person to be the outside person in an affair when they are fully aware of the other's relationship.  Nevertheless, the primary responsibility for maintaining the contract of the relationship falls on the people involved in it.  And, that being the case, both people need to be fully honest with each other **and themselves**.  

It's surprising how hard being honest with yourself is... admitting that there's a part of you that feels a certain way, people are bound to keep fucking up, over and over, and blame it on some bullshit excuse, wondering why it has to be this way.  For myself in any case, I finally accepted that there are certain unsavory things that exist in me and the world and that they will not cease to exist just because I ignore them.  I found once I stopped fighting that, everything became much simpler.  Not so much 'gonads and strife'

These days I've rediscovered the pleasure of admiring from afar.  Yeah that guy's taken and yeah I know he kind of digs me too, beautiful, human connection... if it's with a potential date, that's great, if not, it's not the end of the world.  There's no need for this angsty desire to consummate what we mutually feel, relationships aren't all about that anyway, but only in complete cognizance of the situation.

Yeah, but this whole journey has been meaningful to me.  And in many ways I feel more at peace... and much more comfortable checking out *dat ass* without ever needing to touch it.",,False,,t5_2s90u,True,,

I can recall my earliest argument with her when I was 6 years old. I hit myself in the head because I didn't know how else to deal with the frustration. We've been in a cycle ever since. She gets mad. I try to tell her my side of the story so we can better understand each other and I get accused for being selfish. I apologize and reconcile. She gets mad... I still feel like that little girl

At some point I decided to stop mentioning my emotions at all. She didn't want to understand them and this was demonstrated by telling me that I was making it ""all about me"" and that I was being manipulative. This hasn't worked out very well because she tells me that she wants to understand and I tell her only to have her invalidate my emotions again. Now I just break down most times when she mentions something I've done to upset her. I also apologize profusely when she mentions something I've done wrong (e.g.: ""Sarah, sorry. Sorry, sorry."")

Obviously, but I still struggle with accepting favours from people and especially money. I feel like I deserve none of it because I am never doing enough to deserve it.

She has frequently threatened to kick me out of the house. Usually it is because she feels like I'm not doing enough around the house

For the record, an education and a job all at once. My Mom also has control over my RESP and this makes things a bit more complicated.

My Mom is an excellent provider when it comes to material things. Not such a great provider when it comes to emotional things. My severe hesitance to share anything with her emotionally typically bleeds over into material things because I feel like my needs are invalid (like my emotions). I rarely ask about things for myself so as to spare her the inconvenience. Even if she offers

Recently, narcissistic person who even blatantly described the fucked up situations he put me in and my Mom hardly reacted to it. Now that I found someone who treats me well and the way I deserve, she resents him. This might also stem from jealousy because she has always had dysfunctional relationships with men.

I should also mention that she has been extremely critical of my weight. I used to run and be more active last summer

I gained at the most, so again I try to be sympathetic. I mentioned how uncomfortable this behaviour makes me and now she gets mad at me because she claims that she can't even talk to me anymore.

Last night, over-the-shoulder apology about screaming at me, slamming my door and walking away. These are all things she does regularly during an argument. She never apologized about the verbal abuse. In fact, I brought it up again today and she told me that she had every reason to verbally abuse me.

Today, always ask her what she needs/ wants, etc.) and I feel like she's just looking for excuses to be abusive. I'm not subservient enough for her and this is also the reason why all of her relationships fail.

I feel like everything she does for me is so that she eventually may use it as fodder in an argument

I have always done my best to make my Mother feel validated. I am as compassionate as I can possibly be towards her narcissism and why she behaves this way. I listen to her brag about how she looks and all the compliments she gets. I humour her when she thinks her crush is spying on her. I listen to all of her issues

I know that this is A LOT to take in. This has been an issue in my life for at least 14 years

I have close friends, but there's always been something preventing it. In my new location, I haven't really gotten too close to anyone, except work friends that I sometimes go out to dinner with in the evenings. More recently, I've put a little effort into my look, bought nicer clothes, kept up my general appearances. About a year ago, and I have a routine at home that I do several times a week

I even tried hanging out in more social places. I go to local concerts, and I'm extremely uncomfortable acting that way. I can't really get myself to go up to women cold, and start a conversation. I tried once going to a bar alone, and just forced myself to talk to people. It was one of the most awkward experiences of my life, and I haven't really recovered enough to try again since.

I tried online dating, sensible advice for how to do so. I get very few replies though, and none of them have led to dates. I think I get filtered out a lot of searches or replies, since I am short (5'5"") and somewhat losing my hair. I feel completely demoralized by this approach, and I don't think I have it in me to try another year of the online sites, and be disappointed week after week.

I just don't really know what to do now. I'm started to get really lonely and depressed on the weekends. I know I could force myself to keep trying. In the beginning I was so sure that things would work out, well-adjusted, nice guy. And then the failures kept piling on, month after month. It's gotten to the point where I've begun to spend my evenings alone at home, feeling sorry for myself.

For this whole time, which existed at one time, have gone away but I'm still not over her.

I've had the opportunity to date two amazing girls who would otherwise be perfect for me. But I just can't have feelings for anyone else but her.

It's making me miserable. Multiple friends have told me that I can't be happy with another girl until I free myself from her. But I cant bring myself to do it. I've tried so many times to just stop talking to her - unfollowed her twitter, she's also my best friend and I don't wanna lose her.

My family never knew what to do so they sent me away when I was a teen. I lived in programs, but I stopped that myself and never went back on them. 

I moved every year of my life growing up, been starving, suffering, struggling, doing the best I can. At times succeeding, at times flopping out... Haven't seen my family in 6 years, don't want to.

Lately I've been dating a man 21 years older than myself. He's been doing yoga 4 times a week for years and makes these delicious, and roots. He takes very good care of himself. He's fairly well-off with a heart of gold. He has the resources and upon meeting me felt driven to use them to help me out. He loves me and I love him.

He'll put a whole bag of carrots, a bunch of spinach, 2 whole oranges, a whole grapefruit, etc. Different combinations of these things into one bottle of juice for breakfast. This is what he's been giving me and I love it. Tastes great, feels amazing.

He signed me up for yoga and pays for it and I go 6-7 days a week. He makes me juices whenever we see each other. Sometimes I stay with him and he makes me food and juice. He gives me money to make sure I get enough to eat and can get around. He pays for my phone, he's an angel. It's not without its complications, but he's definitely the hero I need right now. 

My point is not to talk about this man

First of all

My mood is better

This has lead me to think I've probably been suffering from a vitamin deficiency for all these years. Perhaps deficient diet can explain many of the problems I've had.

Growing up my parents didn't really cook. I know I didn't get enough vitamins in my diet. TV dinners don't usually provide those. I shit you not, Organic!?"" yeah. She likes Wendy's. She's thin and I take after her, but my dad is a fat-ass. He likes KFC the best. They had poor diets, therefore I had a poor diet. It didn't get much better after they put me away. 

I've tried as an adult to provide for myself. I eat as much raw food as I can

Since running away at 17, but it always seemed like it wasn't quite enough.

Now that this man has come into my life I've had that extra push to help me get that rock to the top of the hill. He's used his influence to really help me get the vitamins and exercise I've really needed this whole time. 

I never needed psych drugs

I know not everyone can find some rich older guy to take care of them

If you're suffering, and your other basic needs. You might be suffering from a vitamin deficiency, too.

A short background: I've recently broken up with somebody, and that now isn't the right time for us to try and work on our relationship. We are now attempting to be friends and it's terribly hard, especially since it's made me question why we broke up (there were A LOT of reasons). Basically, I've had a rough few months trying to get over somebody who I still talk to frequently. Not easy stuff, my friends.

So the solution I came up with to attempt to get over this guy? Hook up with another one. Great plan, and the one I met my previous boyfriend on) and it was very clear based on our chatting that we were going to basically just meet up to hook up. Fine by me. It sounded fun! Definitely a little kinkier than I'm used to….but I always say don't knock something till you try it. So I did.

Met up with this guy at a bar, and for the most part I enjoyed it. What happened that is eating me up inside now, that I thought nothing of at the time, was that I let him film me. It seemed hot at the time - we said we were going to watch it together the next time we met up. Great! Except the fact when I woke up the next morning, the enormity of it all it me - what the FUCK did I just do?

I let a stranger, and probably will never do again. I let him know that day that I had fun, but had no intentions of meeting up again, and that I'd prefer he didn't keep the videos. I didn't expect this to be successful, and it wasn't. He said no hard feelings, but he was going to watch them still. Fine. That wouldn't bother me.

What bothers me is that lord only knows what he's actually going to do with them. Could he really just keep them for his own personal enjoyment? Totally. Could he post them on the internet for everybody and their mother to see? Most definitely. Will he? The uncertainty is what kills me.

I'm a very in control person. I like to have all my ducks in a row. Me hooking up with this guy was me 'letting go'

I keep telling myself that he doesn't even know me - only first name

My one sister [11] has many issues, she cannot function rationally. Her explosive attitude is always a problem, she screams constantly and conflicts with my other sister and my mom quite often. I fear for her, because she too likes to blame others for her problems. She does not do well in school, and she is too involved with her friends. I feel bad for her because she is my little sister, but she doesn't understand how to be social, she acts out

And my other sister [14] is the biggest antagonist ever. She causes my other sister to go berserk daily. Fighting is normal for two sisters but it is over the top. A few weeks ago her and my other sister were fighting and she ended up starting to beat the shit out of her. I, then it was blamed on me even though I tried to stop it the whole time.

Next year I'll be leaving for college, and I can't stand our lifestyles. They are very mean and I just feel, truthfully, that I just need to leave. I do not want to turn out like my mother. She is a hard worker and cares about us more than anything, don't get me wrong, but she is deluded.  When I'm gone I'm afraid they won't be able to function. I'm the facilitator for the most part. I've been up until 6am trying to calm them down because they're just going insane on each other.  My mom also borrows money from me on occasion, which I don't see again. 

Any advice on dealing with all of this? Am I overreacting? I don't want to sound like a brat.

Despite my overwhelming social awkwardness and introverted tendencies

The first relationship bears special mention because the infidelity began within the first few weeks. I met my first 'serious' girlfriend--let's call her N--shortly after my 20th birthday through one of my best friends. She liked to put on the dark, for better or worse, things got physical between us rather quickly. Having not had any experience with sex prior, my performance was about as appalling as one might imagine. However, N didn't make a big deal of it. I tried to take that to heart, but I never really shook it off. Either way, she and I dated for about six months. 

The sex was still awful by the end of those six months, if we wanted to try moving in together in the near future, and, eventually, the sex. When it came to sex, N didn't have much to say. That is, until she admitted to me that she had slept with someone else not a full two weeks after we'd started dating. I didn't really know how to handle that at the time, but I didn't know how to deal with it.

**tl;dr** - *N; goth-ish/nerd chick

About a year following my breakup with N, but one day she made a move on me. O and I were physical pretty much from the get-go. While the actual sex was still pretty bad, everything but was better. That being said, she didn't really fit in with my group of friends at the time nor did I with hers, so whatever time we had together was usually spent with just the two of us. It wasn't bad, but I did lose a friend or two because of it.

O and I didn't date for very long; three and a half, compounded with the performance with N only made things worse. However, I'd attempted to improve my skill in other areas of the bedroom which I had hoped would solve the problem. It didn't. Eventually, O told me that she had feelings for and had been seeing/sleeping with a friend of hers I had met. We had an awkward exchange after and she sort of wandered out of my life.

**tl;dr** - *O; artsy

In the year and a half that followed, he and I had great chemistry from day one, but it took a while for things to get physical between us. Even so, things didn't fare much better. However, T was not nearly as sexual a person as either N or O, so it was rarely an issue.

Being the longest of my relationships (eight months), at that time, was only a few months away. Then one day, T tells me that he's going on a weekend trip to said city with a few of his friends. Being that this was with only a few days' notice, I didn't have the ability to get work off, so I sent him on his way. He left Friday, called me Saturday in tears and confessed that he'd had a one-night stand, and it was there we broke up.

**tl;dr** - *T; a cute, took a trip out of state and had a one night stand.*

Call me hard-headed, or whatever else you like, but it took until that day when T and I broke up for something to hit me. It wasn't just something that T said, but something that N,O, and T had all said: I never opened up to them. I suppose I could write of N for first-timer's ignorance, but it seems like something I should have known from the beginning. With O, along with not being able to be around our respective groups of friends, I neglected him. What he did wasn't right

I can't open up anymore. Even with my friends, and I'm a shut-in. I don't know what to do with myself anymore and I'm sick of being alone.

So I'm suffering from a problem that sort of matches a lot of others' I've been reading about here,"" open, close, and fulfilling friendships with many friends and family and don't find it terribly challenging to allow myself to let go and share my interests/thoughts/opinions/feelings with most of them. Something weird happens to me when a relationship moves into the romantic territory, though, and suddenly I feel huge amounts of shame and embarrassment for lifestyle choices and worldviews I perceive as somehow being at odds with hers or the rest of the world's. Some issues I have been able to articulate recently would include...

- A constant expectation that I need to justify myself on pastimes/choices that I worry others perceive as questionable.
- A weird aversion from letting people see me enjoy what I am doing or letting them see my thought process (especially as a music student) unless I am secure with how the audience will perceive it.
- A nagging belief that everyone around me seems already to know what they're doing and that I'm scrambling to keep up and discover what the ""right"" way to go about life is.

These are issues that manifest themselves in all but the closest friendships; they're kind-of-sort-of tenable in daily friendships, and it just becomes more painfully apparent as things progress in this direction.

This has led me to really explore and question my motives for getting into relationships or even what they're ""supposed"" to be about. A part of me would be happy to throw my hands up and just stop looking to make it work, and while those are beacons of hope for me they're still pretty unsatisfactory work-arounds, especially the alcohol.

I'm also sick of worrying about all the ""game"" bullshit - if I can have deep, but at this point I am more interested in seeing the openness I feel with guy friends unfold with women as well - sex is just icing on the cake. Is it uncommon or flawed to want a romantic relationship to work the same way two best friends might feel about each other but with the physical element as just an additional dimension?

What if I were to do what ""I wanted to do"" all the time? Romantic relationships? I wouldn't talk to women ever (god forbid sharing my hobbies and interests with them)

So I'm really interested to hear what perspectives people in successful, how much do you have to think about it, and how have you gotten to a place where you don't need to keep walls up? Do you feel like you're playing to a script? Does your relationship with him/her have many/few parallels with close platonic friendships? How are they different? How much of what I'm asking is a symptom of anxiety coupled with little experience? Is my problem uncommon?

Y'all rock. Many thanks.

I have to ""say the right thing,"" all just so I can sweep this anxiety under the rug. I don't feel like I deserve to experience close romantic relationships or am too much of an odd-ball to allow for it to happen on its own.

(this seemed like a good spot to put this information) Her family lives on the other side of the country.  She randomly approached me to ask about the next time we take the trip

I was working nights until sunrise, and another popped up when I was walking it to her.  Sadly, curiosity got the best of me.

There was nothing too incriminating on the surface.  A few playful flirts, talking to this person all night.  I kept it to myself, I didn't want her to think I was spying and I sure as hell didn't want to her to think I didn't trust her.  But that deep dark rush kept building inside of me, and one day it finally got the best of me...

I got home one morning and the house was a complete mess.  At the time we only had one computer and I was curious what time she logged out of the chat program that morning.  Sure enough, so I looked in the history folder and saw a jpeg.  There was my wife, in her underwear posing for a camera.  Also a picture of a shirtless Jay, and a link to a website titled ""Sexy pictures of xxxx"" (my wife).  I was shaking.  Angry.

A slight sidebar - We have had an interesting sex life over the years we've been together.  If we were able to have sex more than once every two weeks it was a miracle.  Different reasons would always come up

I got ahold of Jay instantly on the game, and I will be talking to my wife about this.  His first concern was how I figured it out rather than an apology.  Of all the possible replies, I didn't have a stock answer for that.  But my voice got louder and my wife came out and we spent a good couple hours talking.  She played it off like she just wanted an opinion, which I slowly bought and I regret that I didn't continue the fight.

But despite this, my mind constantly wants to keep things fresh and exciting, almost like I think I've got to be the perfect guy from any romantic comedy who is stuck in the state of smiling, constantly romancing

I was an only child whose parents divorced when I was five. They had split custody of me, and I probably spent more time alone growing up than anyone I know. The pros of this are that I am extraordinarily independent, and learned to take care of myself from a very young age. The cons are that I didn't have siblings or many peers to learn from, relate to, or seek advice from when I was curious about the basics of life. Most of what I learned about any type of relationships were through TV and movies, which undoubtedly gave me a skewed outlook on what I should expect from others, and what was expected of me as a man.

I learned many things the hard way

Despite the occasional overwhelmingly disappointing realizations about reality, I grew up as a fairly secure and normal guy. Though I was admittedly more fragile than the average joe, I was fully aware of what adjustments would be necessary in order to live a normal life and create healthy relationships. I've often attracted some stunningly beautiful women, which I'd introduce to my close friends, who in turn would be absolutely floored. I was never one to sleep around, and I'd often be berated by friends when I refused to take women home who were clearly itching for a forgettable one night stand with me. But these types of flings have never been for me. I have always wanted love and companionship, nothing else. Knowing this, they knew it was because we were actually very seriously interested in each other.

Because of my loneliness as a child, I basically have one gear. I give it my all and am an absolute perfectionist with my role as a boyfriend. Part of the reason is that I paint such a great picture of myself for them over the first few months, that showing that I have faults and am not always ""prince charming"", is simply unacceptable to me. I need things to be just right for me and my SO, and I've of course learned that they rarely are. I simply don't know how to relax and know that someone won't abandon me when I do. When I create such a high precedent for them, I can't help but see their disappointment when I slip up on occasion.

The best advice I was given was by my father, and it seemed to have merit as I began applying it to my relationships. But after anywhere from four to eight months, the relationships always seemed to crumble. I always seemed to become content right as the girl I'd fallen in love with began to have doubts. This led to some very awful breakups that often blindsided me and pushed me into months of depression.

I have been dumped in all six of my ""serious"" relationships. Every one of them have ended with my particular SO in tears, I know they are genuine, and to my knowledge none have ever cheated on me. They usually attempt to keep me in their lives in some sort of capacity for a short period of time as a friend, I try to oblige as painful as it is for me, and after a few weeks, they tell me its too difficult for them, and we never speak again. I'll often try and reconcile with them months or even years later, but none of the bittersweetness makes me feel any better when looking back at the heartbreaks I've experienced.

I've noticed that the few times a girl actually parted ways from me with a criticism, any time the next girl I dated began telling me about her day, I overcompensated and dropped whatever I was doing to make sure I heard every word of what she said. Of course, I'd realize that this was just me ""holding on too tight"" by overcompensating, so I toned these things back after realizing them, and nothing like this was ever a thing that compromised a relationship. But the point is that I am extremely critical of myself, and will often play over and over in my head what I need to do better for next time. This is extremely challenging when you're making few mistakes to begin with, a run for their money.

Recently, not in an overbearing way, but in a constant way which seems to build me up, build me up, build me up... but never fully shows them the true me. Because of this, they eventually realize they can't continue a relationship that never seems to fully peak or have a definition to it. From their perspective, if I had to guess, and it's fresh and exciting the entire time... But it never seems like we fully know each other, they appreciate it

Perhaps, I don't think I fall under this category. I'm a well-rounded smartass with a good sense of humor, who just happens to treat the people he loves with constant respect and admiration. But eventually, I need to make the other people in my life feel like they're impacting my life as much as I'm constantly working on impacting theirs. Excess selflessness can often lead to disappointing results, and I'm very conscious of my behavior leading to the risks of being walked over. But I'm usually pretty good about avoiding those situations.

I know this has been a long read, I greatly appreciate it. I'd love to hear any advice or input you have, and I'll be sure to respond to any feedback or comments I see.

I used to love watching zombie movies when I was younger and then ""28 Days Later"" came out and ruined it for me. Suddenly I was seeing and hearing zombies everywhere. Not literally, because that's when I remember it really changing to an unnatural fear. What the heck is wrong with me.

I obviously know there is no such thing as zombies. Weirdly enough I don't have problems with other types of ""monster"" things. I can watch Aliens or the like with absolutely no issues. I don't even think about those types of things after watching. As a matter of fact watching a ""zombie"" sci-fi flick

The really sad part about this is I love the idea of zombies and the world after a pandemic like disease and how we'd survive or try to thrive. So it makes me sad that I can't watch things like ""The Walking Dead"". Reading is about the only thing I can do to get that fix. Reading doesn't seem to do anything for my fears. So I try to get my kicks there.

So I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences an irrational fear like this. Or if there is a word for it? Should this be in some other subreddit that I just don't know about? Any suggestions to get rid of this stupid fear or am I stuck?

He plays competitively and is in a team and is also admin for various websites. He lives for this particular game and his passion for it is something I love but lately its been too much. 

When we met he was on a break from gaming as his internet connection was not adequate. And we spent alot of time getting to know each other. I knew he was into competitive gaming but since I did not know much about it at the time it didn't bother me. Then we were long distance for a couple of months and in that time he got back into the community. 
And over the past year his role has evolved and he now spends alot of time with admin work aswell as playing.

I do play also but only casually I have other hobbies  and university while this seems to be his most passionate hobbie. But he works full time (40 hours) and then comes home (we live together) spends an hour or two on the net and having dinner with me and then spends the rest of the evening playing often until early morning.  

I don't know if I am over reacting by wanting him to spend more time with me as I can see how much this means to him and he plays in a team and his team mates are all committed to playing scrims nearly every-night but they are all single and he is the only one with a girlfriend. I have tried to be supportive and have gotten more involved with the game aswell. I play with him sometimes But our relationship is beginning to diminish as we dont really have deep conversations anymore. And barely go out together as he doesn't really like to socialise  with my friends. He never used to be like this and now he is just so involved I feel like hes forgotten about me.

After dating for about 4 months, I knew he was going to smoke that night. I was surprised and hurt. I wasn't so much hurt that he was smoking, more hurt that he lied to me about it. I guess it wasn't so much a lie, but leaving out the truth all those times since he came back. I remember him telling me he got sick from it and I didn't even feel bad. I was so mad. 

We had a long talk about it. He knew I felt hurt and lied to. After a few long talks

Fast forward to December. It's just before Christmas and we're at a friend's house. I saw a text (by accident!) that said, which was truthful. He does smoke cigars with his friends. I felt terrible for accusing him. He felt so bad, he almost was crying because he saw how hurt I still was over the whole incident. 

We've talked about it a few times. He feels really bad over it. He tells me he didn't even think about how it effected me. I try not to bring it up, I know!"" or he just feels terrible. 

I don't want to make him feel terrible, like today, **I feel terribly guilty that I can't let it go. I don't know how**. 

My boyfriend has done plenty to prove that he is serious about it. He said he hasn't smoked since that day. He says it's hard when his friends offer it

We've been living together a few years and have dated for many more than that. There have been some good times, mostly because she was cold to me, which made her even icier. I realized I fucked up, and tried to move forward, but she didn't really make it there. We move in, and there are more issues. Meanwhile, I've started to cope with the frigidity more and more by using opiates. I'm not physically addicted at the moment

And so less than ideal relationship on many levels, and hanging out and relaxing with her on one hand, and I've got massive amounts of resentment against her on the other hand. She says she loves me more than anyone in the world, but then here is what shattered what we did have:

Last January, and a 'manage your post' came up under missed connections. It was to a guy she had met at a concert (that it turns out, I had taken her to). I thought WTF, but maybe it was just a fantasy, I'll let it slide. About a month later, I am sitting in the living room, and her phone gets a series of texts. I pick up her phone and see it is from some guy asking her to go out again. I'm hoping again that it is the wrong number, I take her to an old-timey jam at my friend's place, no big deal. Then she asks me to go to this concert of his, and am woken up around 3am by my dog barking. I go down and see my girlfriend had just invited that guy over. The first thing he asks me was ""why did you come to the show?"" In a drunk

So now I start putting things together, placing a missed connection, getting a response, taking them to a movie, and having a beer is a date. Especially since the initial message was flirty. They've stayed in contact. I made her show me her facebook, and his messages are filled with pet names etc. She says it is nothing, but to me it is a betrayal. Same with the music guy. I saw it coming, but to me, I'll meet you at the door."" do not seem like how one goes about creating a platonic friendship (at 3am

I am so hurt now. Even if she has done nothing, and I believe nothing. We had no trust, and we had no real intimacy, but we had something. Now, my trust is further shattered, there is even less intimacy, and what we had is now broken. I am hurt so incredibly much by this. I go through a period where I'm philosophical and think that we just need to admit that this was not to be

How would one even consider repairing a relationship like this. I've kicked her out of the house. Her stuff is here and upsets me. It will upset me more when I am in an empty house with no furniture

How would one plausibly start to fix something like this? Our dogs are best friends, she did something similar last year too, but supposedly never met up with that guy).

Afraid to fuck up.,Smne,6,0,2,"Let me start by the fact that i grown up almost without father as i kicked him from my life at the age of 10 since he was a liar who was stealing money from everywhere he could (and my mom too). 
My mother was borderline crazy during the time where she had to support me + dumbshit my father did (has to run away from home 2 times and sleep outside) and i got bullied while i was in middle school so ... i was really fucked up emotionally and had big problems with relationships friendly or not.

Which led us to S, then went again for her and was acting weird. 
I hated her for it but i lately (just 1 week ago tbh) realised that i was the one who was being an emotional wreck all the time and acting like someone you don't want to be in a relationship with and it wasn't her being a bitch. It hits hard. 
She even tried to go out with me several times even staying at my bus stop every friday to try to make up things with me but i would always ignore her. I told her she was a slut because i was a butthurt teenager and it hurt her

I then met my GF who was as fucked up as i was and we broke up 2 times in the span on 3 months but got back again and never left each other. She got better thanks in part to me and same for me
Things were great for a solid year. 

So here are the problems : 

She(gf) stopped acting like we were dating and we were best buddies (people would always say we looks more like buddy than a couple) Needless to say my feelings for her started going really down and i talked to a mutual friends of her about it to fix things (since when i would talk to her about it she would just start crying and i would be feeling too much guilt to keep going). It worked... for a time. Now i'm just like her father but we're fucking. She complains all the fucking time

Although she is a FANTASTIC person (i can't say it enough.. really) and very understanding, she is glued to me and don't act like we're in a relationship, i'm her first bf and she thinks we will stay together forever no matter what... not really what i'm into to be honest and i told her, especially since it is possible that i move 2 hours from where i live the next year... things were shaky for a while but it went k.
She went from 50kg to 68kg for 1m65 since the first time i saw her and well let's say it took a bit of my attraction to her away (i prefer skinnier girls to be honest). 
I don't love her as much as i used to for reasons described above + other things but i am still VERY attached to her since it's been already 2 years and just thinking about breaking up makes me cry inside and very fast outside. I know breaking up will hurt her like no tomorrow and i feel so much guilt for it, her complains, her problems etc .. I get pissed off by her lifetelling every day but i didn't told her because i don't want to hurt her and she has always been supportive to me no matter what (even when i got mono in last october and couldn't go out for 2 months because of the sick, and i'm still sick...) so i feel a bit of a jerk to complain about it.

Still

S and I recently started to talk again after i apologised for being a dumbass all this time and well after seeing that i'm no longer the weirdo of middle school she talks to me a lot about the past when we were together and a lot about the past
Her LDR BF tried to fuck up my relationship with my current gf (that he knew back in the day) by sending her mails saying i was cheating on her in english (i'm french) with S so i would stay away from S and forbad S from having a facebook because he can't see what she does on fb.. I never knew him so i guess she talked about me to him one day or another.

Now i don't know what to do, she's still beautiful (to me at least, she's my type of girl) and we have a lot of fun together.
But i know what i loose if i quit my current gf, but it looks like there is no good decision at all in this situation.

So, and as far as I've gone with someone I first met that night was heavy petting. But when I drink, or when I don't drink, I just like sex. I like kissing. I like giving head. I like receiving head. I'm a very touchy person, so when I'm around someone I'm attracted to, I want to touch them. Usually, I do touch them. Putting my arm around them, that sort of thing. I like to dance

But in terms of hooking up, but I also trust them emotionally. I'm comfortable around them, enough that I don't feel awkward, and I can make jokes with them, that sort of thing. It's unfortunate, though, because almost all of my attractive male friends are in band with me, and hang out with each other

I know it's bad that I'm less discriminate than the average pristine young American woman. I know it's worse that the people who I hook up with know each other, or whatever. I talk about it regularly. I don't mind people knowing the details of my sex life. In fact, I'd rather they hear it from me than from a third-hand source.

Last night, one who's actually a fairly good friend of mine, sort of -- had a thing with me? I don't know how to describe it. We walked home from a party together, spent a long time talking about the fact that we didn't want to hook up, that he felt uncomfortable and didn't want to go too far, that I liked him more than just someone to hook up with, all that and more. We made out, made out more, because we were both into that and not anything more.

But I told one of my close friends about what happened, how 'I need to calm myself', and 'think about consequences of my actions'. She didn't mean any of it harshly, and I'm not in any way upset at her, but it frustrated me for a couple reasons.

1) I don't care that people talk about me behind my back

2) (and more importantly) This is the first guy in a while that I've not only 'gone home with' with the express intent of NOT having sex or doing anything remotely sexual, because he clearly doesn't seem to mind my history, and if it doesn't bother him, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. And yet this is the guy that my friends think is me 'crossing the line'. Not someone I met online, not someone who was thrown at me at a party, not the random stranger who I went and smoked with in a faraway apartment without telling anyone, but my good friend who actually seems to really like me. I don't get it.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to hook up with strangers. It doesn't make me happy anymore. If I'm gonna have non-committed sex, and I'm afraid that my 'reputation' will ruin any chance I might have had. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I hook up with guys who are friends with each other, people are calling me slutty and telling me to keep my distance.

Starting with that one destructive assumption, financial, societal pressure, loneliness). A man's job is to provide and care for his woman because she loves him enough to make the ultimate sacrifice of satisfying his animal urges (quite aware now how sexist this sounds). Flirting is the same as harassment. Sexual thoughts about a person who know is very wrong and insulting to them. Deriving pleasure from admiring a pretty girl is despicable and makes me a disgusting person (cue self-hatred). Sexuality is inherently destructive, and my fervent wish was to be free of all of all sexual desire.

1362369253.0,19m94k,Therapist says I'm fine. I'm certainly not.,Newni,6,2,10,"Hoping maybe some professional out there can give me some advice on where to go from here.


I'm a 25 year old male, and self esteem issues. I'd been dealing with those problems since I was a preteen and therapy had been suggested to me before, but it wasn't until last spring that I decided to dedicate myself to treatment. I had, in the past, been extremely anxious and depressed - focusing on death, panic attacks, etc. I had been facing these problems on my own because I wanted to enter therapy with a somewhat clear head, as had been the case in the past. Last spring, I make a conscious effort to talk to people and try to make friends. I have an RX for 100mg of Zoloft, my therapist says that he thinks we can wrap things up. That

The thing is, and though I understand what he's saying about being self-sufficient, I still don't think we've even begun to scratch the surface of my problems. I have some serious issues with trust/love/sex/women. When I first started attending sessions, he asked me what I was hoping to get out of therapy. I told him that I have never felt connected to anyone or anything, and that what I really want is to be close to someone romantically and emotionally. Apparently he took that as I was looking for dating advice, and gave me a ""play it cool, don't be too available"" speech. My inability to do so aside, I could visit seddit for that. What it boils down to is I feel completely unlovable. I feel fat, socially awkward, only I'm physically exhausted have sore muscles too.

I smoke weed multiple times a day, but my sister is a chronic smoker for her epilepsy and makes it far too easy for me not quit. I want to get my own place, hoping that maybe if I'm not around her all the time it won't be so easy to smoke up whenever I feel like it. But, on the other hand, it's not exactly like I can put it all on her. I like to get high... probably a little too much.



Now

However, irrationally resenting the entirety of women. I have never met a woman who hasn't cheated. Literally, none. If you paid me $1000 to write the names of three women who I would trust to be entirely faithful in a committed relationship, I swear to the flying spaghetti monster that I couldn't do it if I had a week. I seriously believe that they are genetically designed to be sneaky, lying, manipulative, shallow, and then the best provider - the two rarely being one in the same.

This is not to say that there are no women who are not like this. Or that there aren't any women that I like or respect. Simply that, and so there is a predisposition to these things. Concepts of honor, loyalty, teamwork, compromise, authenticity; these things are lost on most people today, but at least I've met a few guys who generally seem to value them, I know these thoughts are irrational. I'm not saying them to get a rise out of anybody, but now I'm worried that if I bring it up next time I see him it will seem like I'm just spewing out a bunch of shit just so the meetings won't stop.


My issues with sex are worse than I thought. I always knew I had some, swapping flashes with girls. It was around this age that I was first touched by a couple older girls (I think one was around 12  or 13 the other 14 or 15, probably both victims of abuse themselves) for the first time. I can't necessarily say I hated it but still, it would probably be a safe bet to say that these incidents weren't good for me.



I've always been a bit of an introvert, my mother was out late more nights than not. My father worked in a slate quarry 10 or 11 hours a day, come home, eat dinner, watch tv, and go to bed. We lived in a shitty two bedroom trailer, 2 parents, 2 girls. A 5th was born, and jerked off too much instead of doing stuff like... ya know... learning social skills



Got into college and realized ""Oh shit, did terribly because I'm considered reasonably intelligent but I'm a horrible student. Dropped out of college after a few semesters before I did irreparable damage to my college transcripts, worked menial jobs for a while. Met a girl at one of these jobs, lost my virginity at 22, got my heart broke, spent a few years dealing with it. I'm finally in a place where I think I'm mature enough to handle a relationship, and I'd like one, I guess.



So what do I do? How do I move on from here? Tell my therapist that I think we should keep going? He's a good guy


Anyone deal with situations like this before? What's a good type of therapy to get rid of unwanted prejudices?

I'm a 20 year old male gay/bisexual student. I constantly find myself falling for someone and putting them on a golden pedestal: I think they are amazing, since I do not think that I am good enough, attractive enough, good looking enough to make another person happy.

As a child, and sexually abused by my baby sitter. In high school, I never dated, because I felt I wasn't good enough. Now in college, I've been having these problems become more intense. My body image issues are growing (I can't look at myself and not feel disgusted), I started cutting my wrists, and I went about a week without eating anything.

Now, or if those feelings are just what a crush is. I feel as if most people can look around and point out who they find attractive; whereas, I don't find many people attractive and they pretty much just look the same (as in I have a type).

At the beginning of this year, I've been talking to this guy, and last Wednesday he came over to my room to watch a movie. Things got a little heated and we started making out (my first kiss at age 20... another reason why I'm pathetic), and I had to stop him when he started taking off my shirt.

Truth is, and just wanted to spare the vulnerability of exposing myself to him. This boy is also much more experienced than I am (whether it be in relationships or random hook ups, mostly the latter). I couldn't tell if he was just trying to get with me or if I actually mean something to him.

I'm a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician. I can pull people out of car wrecks without hesitation

I want to feel worthy and wanted. I just want someone to feel happy just being around me. I don't want to look at myself and find the smallest things to try to change. Tenuous things like trying to whiten my eyes with eye drops

At the beginning of last week she seemed particularly stressed, and how I am the best thing going for her out here, and that she didn't want to hurt me. I assured her it was fine, then went outside to shovel some snow, and came back and calmly talked to her. I basically said that I didn't want to prevent her from being friends with her ex, granted I thought that it was a bit more complicated than that with him having just proposed to her. I also just talked about how I really think she needs to gain control of all the things that are negatively affecting her, and think about the positives. She was relieved at my reaction, etc etc.

Keep in mind she has told me on several occasions she hasn't had a good V-Day in 7 years, talk to some fun old couple at a bar, go visit a bartender we both know, then head back to her place. I'm laying in bed, and she goes to write a note to her neighbor about some pyrex she meant to return. While she is in the hall I hear her on the phone. She is talking in a very girlfriendy voice, one she doesn't really use with me, and then I hear her say ""I love you.""

I basically sat her down and told her that I don't trust her right now, that she needs to figure her life out, and that we need space.

My GF of 8 years (I'll call her GF from now on) left me 2 weeks ago. With her, but I was fine with it. Now, she left, and everything is going to hell.

I've always been bullied at school, even though I was still a little socially-awkward-penguinish. I had some girlfriends between 18yo and 24yo. As soon as I lost them (sometimes they would leave me, sometimes I would leave them), I had this urge to find someone else, another crush, as soon as possible.

I didn't like that, I was all over her. Now that I think of it, it's scary. Oh, and it was totally impossible for me to declare my love to someone I wasn't sure was interested in me. It's was my worst nightmare.

When I met my GF in 2005, and I went to see a psychiatrist. We discovered I was probably suffering of codependency (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency) which, basically, is when someone's happiness depends only on the happiness of someone else. I was happy as long as she was happy. When she wasn't, I wasn't. Just discovering that this problem had a name fixed the problem automatically, and I no longer needed the psychiatrist.

7 months before now, and I felt like the king of the world. Until she left. She left, telling me there was no love anymore from her side, and especially no sexual desire. 

And since she left, I don't know why. The only person who knows my entire story is a friend I found on a weight-loss social media. This person lives 15 hours of car from my place, but is the best ear ever. J, you know who you are, and I thank you. 

So now I'm alone. It's been only 2 weeks. The first week went well. But since a few days, since I'm a very faithful guy, I wouldn't look at other girls really. And this morning, I sent an email to my friend J, saying ""Is it just me being single, or is my workout coach immensely beautiful?"" followed by a link where you could see my coach. 2 seconds after hitting ""send"", I thought ""...... here we go again"".

This week, slept with me, or do anything with me. Did not happen, and I'm kinda glad. In my head, it was crazy, I was just starting to deal with a breakup. But in my heart, in my veins, all I wanted was some attention from her. It scares me. 

Also, but not satisfied. Once, once only since the breakup, I was in the bathroom, washing my hands. I stared at myself in the mirror, smiled at myself, and for a very short second, I'd look at myself in the same mirror

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I have. I lost the person that was the anchor for my sanity and self-esteem, I didn't beg my GF to stay with me. I didn't want a girl to stay with me just to avoid hurting me. 

When I'm at work and with friends, I hate myself, I hate the fact that I'm alone. And I'm scared I'm going back to where I was 8 years ago. I'm just not happy by myself.

I guess the video reminded me of my childhood: going to Catholic school, how too Americanized I've become (it feels like I'm living a lie even though I'm a 2nd generation American citizen), how I slowly forgot to speak Spanish even though it was my first language, that time when I was 21 and I was getting so many looks from all the young 19-20 year-old ethnic Mexican girls who worked at this restaurant me and my family stopped to eat at in El Paso, Texas (we were driving from Southern California - were we live - to my uncle's house in Belton, Texas, to spend the Christmas with them)....... I don't know... I feel like I can't flourish in this environment (Southern California)... so many people... pretty much everyone has adapted into that kimkardashian/kanyewest/americanidol/KROQ culture.. maybe I'd flourish if I lived in some colonial town in Mexico or in the past on some grape farm in Northern California (like in the movie A Walk in the Clouds)... I mentioned how I once visited my uncle in Texas..well our family spent 2 weeks there, I actually wanted to go out

I think I blame the 4th grade teacher who called me to write my name on the board during class while I was mutual flirting with a girl in my table group (we were both smiling and looking each other in the eyes.. she had her head down on the desk and was starring me in the eyes while smiling, too.

We started talking less and less and there was a lot of tension.  The sporadic fights started turning into regular fights (especially over little things).  I blame my actions were the catalyst for things going bad.

I've had problems with lying to her.  I would lie to cover up one of my fuck ups or lie so she wouldn't overreact (""Is this ugly?"", I would try do something nice to make her happy, but I started to do less of those things out of the blue.  Every Friday night, I would go have band practice and come home late.  She wouldn't mind if she had a party to go to or hangout with her friends.  But she had no plans, she would get mad at me and wanted me to stop going.  We talked about getting married and having kids and things seemed pretty optimistic.  We both saw living with each other for the rest of our lives.  But I feel like I built it up to a ""too good to be true"" kinda thing.  I started to disbelieve it and second guessing everything.

Eventually, and I told her I need time to get my shit straight.  I can't stand seeing her cry because it would make me so sad, I felt like I couldn't leave.  I felt so insensitive at the time because I stopped hugging her, told her I'm leaving very coldly and left.

1358982523.0,175isq,[21m] I feel that no girl is interested in me and don’t know why.,throwaway59015901,7,0,8,"First I want to say thank you for reading this. I wrote it as honest as I could and if I could solve my problems without the internet I would. Trust me.

I am 21 years old and never was in a relationship. Whenever I meet a girl and I genuinely like I get her number most of the time and often get a date or two. Sometimes we even kiss, but she does not seem to feel the same. Because of this I often have confidence issues and I think they are part of the reason why girls don’t feel attracted to me when they get to know me better.

Originally my confidence issues come from childhood. Until I was 18 my parents basically told me all the time how disappointed they are in me and that I do everything always wrong, but still I had to go to exactly those out-of-school activities so that I “learn how to deal with them”. When I started university I got some new friends and let old friends go that I felt pulled me down, emotionally and also career wise. When I was 19 I had for the first time in my life something that you could call self-esteem.

Today this mostly reflects in the fact that I am uncomfortable with talking in large groups of people I don’t know well

When I think about, intelligent and most of the time happy person (I asked them and told them they could be mean). That is mostly because I either don’t want to say anything (e.g. in discussion I don’t care about: which team will win a soccer cup) or sometimes I just don’t find the right words. Most people would probably also describe me as a very nice person. I often help people with stuff, when I know more than they do, even if I don’t know them that well. This may also be an issue with girls: I may ask too much about their preferences. But I generally don’t treat them too different from good friends, generally a bit less joking around as I kinda developed a feeling for how to joke around with my best friends.

I personally think I am a great person but I fucking hate myself for being so bad with girls. This one thing bothers me so much. I am an martial arts instructor, I have a lot of good friends, but it bothers me so fucking much that I can’t get a girlfriend. I cannot even tell you with words.
(Part of the above paragraph might seem a bit narcissistic

How do I overcome these confidence issues? What could it be that girls don’t feel attracted to me?

I posted a thread long ago asking for advice on what to see

Two weeks later, but couldn't bring myself to talk to them. I felt like they were all having fun with each other and that there was no place for me. I stood there, feeling cold and tired and miserable. And then she showed up.

I had known her in high school

When I moved back home after college, somehow. Maybe I needed to bring out the life in them, or maybe I was looking for something that I really needed to find in myself. Of course no actually attractive girl has ever met me from OkCupid. If they even replied, they would always cancel dates a day before, or not show up, or show up and act really hostile the whole time. In the midst of this, I contacted her on a whim and asked if she wanted to meet up. She agreed. We hung out at a bar. It was like those scenes in a movie where the black and white picture turns color. It was all finally right. That was the first night I had felt OK in over a year. Then we hung out again next week in her studio. She told me more messed up stories like how she would get drunk and piss on the floor of the guy she was sleeping with. I wasn't sure if I was attracted to her, but she didn't reply and I took that as a rejection.

She became addicted to drugs and then went to rehab, and I saw her once, briefly, to show her around my workshop. Then in the winter we went to a museum together. Again, those eyes. We talked for a long time. I didn't know how she felt about me. I sent her some photos I had made, and a few weeks later she texted me that they were beautiful.

And so when I ran into her at the concert, ""We should do a sunday."" And so we started doing it regularly. She complained about her mother, and I empathized. My mother has tortured me most of my life and few people understand. She liked making things, and wanted to get back to it. I did too, and I've been increasing my skills in that area. I entertained the thought that we could be partners, we could help each other grow and achieve our goals and become better people. But every week we hung out, she had some new crisis and she never listened to my advice. Every week, I felt like it would be the last time.

One week, and going back into her cold, unheated house, and I wanted her to feel like someone cared about her. She kissed me back then said goodnight. I was terrified that would be the end. But it wasn't. When I saw her again, and asked if I could kiss her at the end. She said, No. You're interesting, but I'm not attracted to you. I said I wasn't that attracted to her either

After that, but later she seemed reluctant to let me touch it again. Another night when she was upset, she hugged me for close to a minute. We hung out three weekends ago. I told her about how my best friend just got laid off, and I was worried about him (I'm also worried that he'll stop being my friend now that we don't see each other every day). She talked about her dreams for the future and I guess I slipped up by saying something about what I'd be doing there. Not sure if that had anything to do with what followed. In the end, she said she had a great time.

Two fridays ago, I tried again, but still nothing.

Part of me genuinely wonders if she's ok. Her facebook page hasn't changed since we last talked (I've been checking it often)

I know what the reality is. She's had her fill of me, but I had nothing else. She's the only girl I've felt close to since high school. The only one I actually enjoy being with. The only interesting girl who is actually willing to spend time with me. And of course that means I'm nothing to her.

Now I am on my own again. Back to trying to get drunk enough to maybe hit on girls at a bar (harder and harder these days). Trying to somehow overcome my despair and focus on doing something with my life. But in the end I always fall back down again

EDIT: There is one more general thing I should mention. I have for a long time had these feelings and I have a hard time understanding them. I tend to get emotionally attached to girls I'm not really attracted to physically. And I tend to have no emotional interest at all in girls I'm attracted to. This makes it difficult to have any kind of relationship with either group. I guess in part this may be because attractive people tend to have personalities that are not conducive to emotional or intellectual connections in general. I don't know. Someone help me figure it out. For a long time I thought this would become clearer if I could just have sex with enough girls, none of this has become any clearer with age.

EDIT 1/25: Messaged her roommate two days ago, much more so than it probably will. But right now it's still all that I can think about.

We talk. Inicially the story was the same. ""I'm confused, even thought about getting back to her, I don't want to lose contact with you, I don't really love her, bla bla bla bla bla bla"". I thank god at least he didn't have sex with her again after being with me...

After a while, it's a principle. Period.

Anyway he defends himself for a while

Well he got out of the car to take a piss and when he comes back I was crying. I didn't hear him coming... He hugs me and tells me it's over: He's going to fix his life. He say he can't be with either me other the other girl, since he has no idea how long will it take, but also because it gives him ""pressure"".

Of course

I have no idea what to do. I love him, it is a bit obvious that he isn't, but he still could be... In any case, what happens if he DOES fix himself? Who will he be? Will he want to be with me? The unknown hurts. That's why he said what he said and I can understand it hurts him too, but... I don't know...

Guys... I just don't know what I'm doing anymore. What I should do... I know I may not follow the right advice from anyone and I might do exactly what I feel like doing and that may well be the wrong thing to do... But still... I need help

As far as I can tell

* I have zero self confidence, when I was informed that personal satisfaction is unimportant as long as there are any financial obligations.  I also have almost no idea what actually makes me happy, as it's never really been able to be a priority.  Most people probably aren't particularly happy, so why should I worry about it?

* I simultaneously want to actually make friends and even get close enough to date someone, last time I checked, most people don't want much to do with someone who spends just over 50 hours a week working and commuting, with hobbies that are almost exclusively solitary. 

* Related to the second, that they clearly haven't gotten to know me well enough to figure out that I'm not really worth the effort.  And when I get compliments, I usually just assume that the person is joking. 

* I work long hours at a desk job (10 hour shifts in a help desk, am not qualified to work in any other area. As a result I'm heavily burned out, hate working, but don't see any alternative besides just sucking it up for the next couple of years until I work into another job that'll likely be just as shitty. 

* Even if I deem something concrete to be the matter, and have issues actually putting my thoughts into spoken form, especially when on the spot.

I [26 F] have been in a loving relationship for more than two years now which has helped me grow in countless ways. My partner [24 a-gendered/androgynous], and they are smart, remarkably patient and generous, and do everything in their power to show their love and make me happy. However, things aren't perfect, in that they are an incredibly cerebral person with a very low sexual drive, and I am an intellectual but predominantly visceral person with the libido of an 18 year old boy and a deep-seated desire to feel like a sex kitten. This has been a reoccuring source of stress and tension in our relationship, I know it's predominantly to make me happy and not because it's in their true nature or what they need.

 I'm happy that we've been intimate more frequently lately (about once a week), and not much brings me more satisfaction than being able to make a person's knees quiver and hear them moan with desire. 

Then there is my partner's friend [24 M], and the part of me with a need to feel desired in an overwhelming way could be satisfied with sparking their interest. I didn't want to be a shit disturber, and I understood the psychological motivation behind my feelings, so I just pushed these romantic thoughts towards the back of my mind and focused on being a loving and supportive partner. 

Let me elaborate, my partner sent me a text that their friend was non-functionally drunk at a bar in my neighborhood, and since at the time my partner lived over an hour away, they asked if I could rescue their friend and bring him safely home. 

Before that night, for one thing, and finding him slumped over in a bathroom brought out all of these weird hormonal protective instincts, so I was wiping down his face with a wet paper towel and helping him get off the floor. He seemed too drunk to navigate the crowd by himself, so without thinking about it I grabbed his hand and pulled him through the throng and back into the cold night air. 

This is where things start to get really weird - at first I had grabbed him by the wrist and yanked him out of the bar like an impatient mother, so I grab his hand to tug him back and then he clamps down on my hand, and for the entire walk back to his apartment we maintain contact, slowly interlocking our fingers. The entire time, we avoid eye contact and maintain conversation as if everything were normal. He reaches the apartment, hugs me goodbye, and then tucks his chin over my back and proceeds to talk to me, while hugging for about five solid minutes. 

Maybe he was just drunk, sitting next to me (instead of them), chatting excitedly about music and pop culture references we both enjoy but my partner could care less about, and sometimes even acting more like my partner than my actual partner - a moment comes to mind when we were all sitting outside and my skirt got snagged on the bench, and the friend immediately gets down on his knees and fixes it for me, before my partner even had a chance to help. 

Other times

The weirdness continued. The friend had my cell number because it was needed to buzz into my old apartment (the buzzer is hooked up my phone somehow, sometimes in the evening or even later at night, and we started having impromptu hangouts since we lived so close together and enjoyed so many of the same things. We'd play rock band together, or go get dinner, and it was almost always one on one. We're both avid ents, and on a few instances he would roll joints and hold them up to my mouth instead of just passing them to me, but I don't know if he was trying to be helpful, or if there was an ulterior motive.

Honestly, interested in both of us and just seeing what could happen, or not interested in either of us and just really, really awkward and with a bad sense of common physical boundaries. 

We went almost two months barely talking or texting earlier this year, and that I needed to back off from the one on one contact. I agreed with them, and I also pushed for my partner to spend more time one on one with their friend without me, so that I wasn't a part of the equation.

After several months of smooth sailing and minimal interaction with this friend, and anyone else they'd want to come, but my partner wasn't interested in this particular show and the other friend who was going to come ultimately bailed. So the friend and I wound up going to the show just the two of us, and we joked around the whole time and danced a little bit, and when he ran into an old friend he introduced me by name but he didn't say ""my friend ___,"" or, the way he used to

The show was on a Tuesday in late November, at least on my end (and I'm starting to be more convinced it's on his end as well). Because for every single Wednesday since then (so for 5 weeks now), we've spent all evening together, alone and in the dark. 

It's a ritual - he buzzes me into his apartment complex, we smoke a bowl, and then he turns out the lights for the tv show. He fidgets in his seat, cracks his knuckles, straightens his sleeves and tugs his socks up. He alternates between pointing his whole body towards me, foot on my side of the table, rubbing up and down as if we're playing footsie, cocooned protectively in his scarf or blanket.

Each week it escalates. Before Christmas, about a foot apart, sharing a scarf in the dark. Even after the show ended, and he was looking up videos online to watch, he didn't turn the lights on. He hugged me goodbye three times.

He tells me I have energy like sunshine

We don't see each other over Christmas vacation, and he sits next to me the entire time and makes flirty jokes (we were playing peggle at one point and I mention how I ""totally suck with the dragon character"", and he replies ""So you're saying you suck with the d?"" stuff like that).

Yesterday, and every time the character who vaguely resembles me came on scene, he commented on how awesome she was and how she's the best. At one point, I swear he had his eyes locked on me and sighed dreamily as he said (about the character), ""she's woooonderful."" 

As we have our usual hug goodbye, as he closed the door, ""sleep well."" 

Half an hour later, and I hope you sleep well!"" And now I can't stop thinking about him, and my intuition is saying ""c'mon now, it was late at night and he was thinking of you and couldn't resist saying something even though he's seen you two days in a row and you just left his place 20 mins ago... that's not normal friend bahavior. You don't text someone that late or say those sorts of things to people you feel for platonically... right???"" 

I'm sorry this is so massive, and they have repeatedly suggested the possibility of an open relationship so that I can feel physically satisfied. Once, when drunk, I even confessed that I want to make out with their friend sometimes, and they said they'd be fine with that... but it's too good to be true, right? This is a massive shitstorm waiting to happen, and I refuse to be the vagina that tears apart a ten year friendship. Because even if my partner doesn't care about physical intimacy, I've been down a path like this before and I know jealousy would be unavoidable. I know that even now there are moments of weird tension - my partner and I will be chatting about their friend

It's just... bad. And I know I'm being awful and frankly I welcome your insults. Something needs to snap me out of this. I need to just stop talking to this guy, but that's limmerance for you. I know it isn't love. But in this second I just want to, y'know, run to him and shove my tongue down his throat. I want to feel those butterflies in my stomach from animal attraction, to tease him and kiss him and just damn the consequences. I think it is a remarkable testament to my remaining shreds of willpower that I have never tried to kiss him.

Now I've been reading up on it and I'm not sure it directly deals with the issues I have. 

I'm in contact with a psychiatric hospital through a therapist and my diagnosis was based on a bunch of tests I did with their in-house psychologist. 
My issues are mainly with dealing with other people and I'm extremely anxious in doing so and I've had tons of bad experiences due to either over-compensating this anxiety or acting out of a willingness to fit in and be like other people. 
The thing is I feel like I'm left outside and I feel very much alone

The thought of having to pick an education to later get a job is weighing heavy on me.

It all seems so intangible to me and I feel like I don't belong in this reality
I also know that much of it is communication
I'm afraid of being misunderstood and I already feel misunderstood.

I also don't really enjoy stuff the way I used to. I used to love reading fantasy novels and playing rpg's and adventure games. 
While being depressed for the last 5 years this has stopped. I no longer really find enjoyment in anything. 
So now I don't do a lot. 
I just sit in my room all day and browse the internet and take driving lessons. Sometimes I'll start doing something
I don't really care tbh. 

I also have trouble concentrating and remembering things

I've always been treated like some sort of genius by people around me and I just feel like a fraud and an idiot. I live with my mom who pushes me and I don't know how to convey what I feel is the issue with me living a normal life. There's always the possibility of taking her with me to the meetings I have at this psychiatric hospital, which is a horrible thing to say, since she lets me stay in her house rent-free and works her ass off and she's expressed willingness to help. So has my father, but I don't want him to meddle in this either.

Being juniors in High School, even 5 years later. My third girlfriend was pretty religious and often made it clear that she wanted to get married and have children one day and didn’t want to have sex before marriage. I was only 22 and marriage was the farthest thing from my mind.


I’m 24 now and still a virgin. I don’t mean to say that getting laid is all that I care about (although what 24 year old male doesn’t think about it a lot), either through class or other friends, so I don’t know the first thing about approaching women I don’t know. 


I have pretty low self-esteem (between my virginity and being a little overweight and probably a host of other issues), half the time I’m the one making everybody laugh. I’m a completely different person when I’m in the presence of people I don’t know, particularly women. 


The idea of approaching a woman fills me with dread. I imagine everyone is judging me, they just take the swing. That’s all well and good, but if it was as simple as flipping a switch, I wouldn’t still have this problem. My biggest problem is that I simply do not know what to say to someone without sounding like I have an agenda.

First, but in recent years I have discovered an athletic streak within me and I exercise and play sports daily now; I used to be ashamed of my body, but I can take off my clothes at will now. I was valedictorian at my high school, and was involved heavily with the yearbook.

I've been reading a lot on /r/seduction at first just to pickup girls and it quickly became a goal for me to do it for self improvement, and I feel like my social life is quite fulfilled. I have what you call MAJOR social proof and I am the type of guy to say hello to everybody at an event and ask for their name, shake their hand with full on eye contact and make some small talk. I dress very fashionably and stylishly (A lot of people think so, and at this point in my life I am fully confident in the way I dress) and I have rarely met a person that I cannot make smile within minutes or even seconds of meeting me; I can become the center of attention effortlessly.

At this point in my life, funny, outspoken and witty guy and people are always surprised when I tell them that I have a lot of anxiety and intimacy problems.

Just the other day, but I just did not feel it. In fact, I had not even realized she wanted to kiss me until the day after upon some self reflection. Even after 2 more dates with her I did not make a move, and as I expected I was what you would call ""friendzoned"". (though I believe that only exists in one's mind, that is a different topic for another day)

That is when I thought back to my earliest days and I realized I've always had this problem with intimacy

It is odd, but these problems may stem from earlier problems in childhood.

He's saved me from the clusterfuck freak show that was my previous life. I've always felt like he was too good to be true and that I was nowhere near good enough for him. However, no matter how much money he made). I had some terrible jobs where I was harassed as well as seriously injured on the job but he would only say ""find a new one before you quit!"" Much easier said than done...

Anyway
I was abused physically, just to force her into getting back with him. It never worked, but I clearly remember sitting in the kitchen watching the flimsy backdoor get rammed and being so afraid that the hinges/lock/anything would snap and he would be there. He chased me down alleys in his van (the free naps &amp; candy van is more terrifying to me than most) trying to get me but fortunately there were always escapes like unlocked gates or holes in fences. We moved across the country to get away from him. 

Shortly afterward Mom started dating a man 13 years younger than her; he was 7 years older than me. It was mortifying because she would bring him to school events and kids would always think he was my brother and then look at me weird or say mean things about it. I hated him so much, he began beating the hell out of me. He knocked my head through a wall and gave me black eyes. I told my mom and she was in denial, just said ""stop blaming him, I know that happened in P.E."" so when they got drunk and he stumbled into my room while she slept and tried to rip my clothes off I knew I couldn't tell her. If she didn't believe physical evidence...why bother? He never actually raped me but came very close. A lot. The physical/emotional abuse from him, including breaking my cat's tail because I had trouble on a math test, never ended. Eventually they broke up and we moved back to the West Coast. 

Within months she dated another guy and he asked her to marry him after 4 months. I fought this tooth and nail but they bought a house and moved in together. Shortly afterward he decided I was more trouble than I was worth. I was 13 and he started giving me oxycontin and wine to make me sleep away the day and out of their hair. He also got fat and then she didn't like him, but never unlocked the door. He took close-up pictures of my acne when I wasn't paying attention and posted them all over the house so I could see what he ""was forced to see"" and I ""should suffer from the ugliness too."" Lots of stuff like that, but the final kicker was waking up to his hands around my throat. I knocked over a lamp and it startled him enough to let go so I could take in air and scream. Mom came in and he went to work. I decided then and there I had to leave (I was 17, just starting senior year). I asked my grandfather if I could move in with him but he said it was my mom's responsibility to take care of me. Had he known what happened, he might have said something else, but I was too scared to tell him. I was too scared and ashamed to tell anyone about any of the abuse I had endured over the years. If my own mother didn't care, why would anyone else? 

I ended up moving in with the only person who would take me: a friend who liked me but I wasn't attracted to. His parents moved my stuff into his room from the spare (I paid them rent) saying they knew we were fucking (we weren't, they made me wear short skirts and stuff to attract the men over to sell fundraiser tickets to games. My entire life I was an object. It's all I knew--I had to look perfect or else I would get beaten. That's actually how it ended. He thought it was funny how I would flinch if he lightly slapped my face and kept doing it while I sat on his lap with my wrists pinned. I finally pulled one free and knocked his hand away, accidentally hitting his chin. I didn't even register the face punch that knocked me across the room onto a fireplace. I laid there with tears running down my cheeks coming back to myself just in time to hear his dad say ""you're playing too rough, son."" I moved back in with my mom (who had finally left the man who tried to kill her daughter). 

I lost myself in my job at a retail store and met my husband. I never told him anything about my past aside from ""I had a terrible childhood. I was abused and it was shitty. I don't want to talk about it."" 
Flash forward to present

Now that I'm more mentally sound, and the therapist says it's good in the long-term to let people in, the retelling is making me feel so sick. I hate opening up to him like this, especially when I feel like we might not work out. I want a family and he doesn't--and there's no way I would let a child into a life where it's not fully wanted by it's parents. I'm having nightmares again, panic attacks, and I don't feel close to him at all anymore. I lay on him and he holds me and I cry because I'm so unattached to everything. I want to make this work. I really do love and respect him, but I don't know how to make everything okay again without giving up what I want. And how do I know if I really want something? I've never had an opportunity to really develop myself--I've always had to hide it or in this case, you're a fantastic person and I thank you.

I (would like to think) have options but will generally 'fall' for the best looking girl who likes me.  Sometimes this feeling is reciprocated but I'm constantly worried about how clingy I seem to them.  Because of this, she was so attached to her ex that I got 'friendzoned' pretty hard and was always a lower priority to her than her ex even though, for me, spending time with her was almost always my top priority.  This hurt me pretty badly, I think I'm over it now but it has definitely affected the way I see relationships and make decisions.  I realize that experience is not a good benchmark to use to judge/measure future relationships but I'm kind of at a loss as to how frequently I should contact someone i'm interested in (even during the pre-dating/dating stages).  

In addition to all this, chances are, they're doing a lot less with their lives than I am and are probably exponentially less successful so I don't really care what they think"".  Fucked up?  Maybe.  But it applied to my interactions with guys and girls and made our interactions very pleasant (good times to be had by all).  Another example, in stats class, where my groups consisted of mostly awkward people, my confidence was also through the roof.  But as soon as I get placed in a group with that one frat bro who is more sociable than I am, knows more people and is almost equally as intelligent

I've tried 'fake it til you make it'.  It works to some extent - only in situations where I have enough material to contribute (ie conversations centered around stuff I'm interested in).  It's not really a problem with my conversational skills

I had a normal upbringing, stepdad, and half-sister (Golden Child.) As a result, he keeps his relationship with his mother cordial, but aloof (we live thousands of mils away), and chooses to have no relationship with his step dad.

I have always found them all to be cold and very shallow - they say nice words, two-faced and judgmental thanks to church, and the mother may have BPD so she is pretty unstable. She's an empty nester now, and has NO life outside of church.

I always had a hard time adjusting to such volatile and uncaring people. Most of all, and that her half-brother had a beautiful childhood and that I am simply slandering her family.)

That's not who I am with everyone else in my life - but it's like they are poison. Husband learned long ago to stay away, and claims (maybe rightfully) that it's my own fucking fault for having contact with them.

But I can't seem to cut ties. Maybe because if I do - I'll be painted as the devil woman

Maybe all I wanted was to have decent in-laws who were balanced human beings who treated husband well and gave a shit about me. I got none of that - how can I let go? How can I STOP THIS CYCLE?

I can will myself to not think about them for long stretches, or I get into periods where I really think about them all the time.

1348919018.0,10nwzd,Girlfriend left me after three years after I changed my life to accommodate hers.,FRizKo,7,2,8,"We met in Sweden while she was having an summer internship at IKEA world HQ (she's American (22) I'm Swedish (25). 

I lived next door to where she was staying and we spent the entire summer together. That fall I went to visit her in the US. After that it got shaky as we didn't know how to continue our relationship. Skype was a big factor in our lives at this point. I had a current life situation where it was no problem for me with 6 hour time difference. 

Eventually she folded and hooked up with her ex. This was painful as I could see more and more pictures of her on facebook with this guy. Eventually she told me over skype about him and her hooking up. I so wish I left all this at this point.

A few weeks later her ex decided that he didn't really want her and dumped her. She came crying to me. And seeing how I also felt the stress of not knowing any future together I forgave her. 

Shortly after we came up with a plan to be together. She would apply to go to grad school her in Sweden. Grad School was at the time free here. And there are several programs that are purely international. Including one that she was passionate about. Environmental studies. 

She applied but didn't get in. We found out that this was because it was the last year that non EU students would study for free after the government had changed the laws and a record amount of applicants applied. 

Somehow we managed to keep going. We decided she would apply for a resident permit that you can get here in Sweden if you are in love with a swede. That worked and she went over to Sweden to visit me for a week. Next year she got in to the school. Keep in mind I did most of the work. 

We had a vacation in Italy together and shortly after she moved in with me in Sweden to start school. This was august. Everything went on and seeing as she didn't know any Swedish and she was swamped with school work. She never got to hang out with my friends in a meaningful way. (eventually politeness wears down and people start speaking their own language at party's and stuff). 

So I changed everything to accommodate her. To make her happy. 
I started alienating my friends and my family. Eventually she started making friends in Her class. Most of her classmate lived in another city so it was hard for her to attend any social events. It was an 1 hour commute. And when she started sleeping over at her new friends places I was happy about it because she got to have some social things happening to her that wasn't solely based on my sacrifice. 

January she tells me she has lost most of her feeling towards me. I got a real wake up call and start doing the social events at her school with her ( I even bought her a 800$ air ticket for this upcoming summer so me and her could go visit her family shes been missing). 

This being me working 9-11hour days then commuting to her Schools city to be completely exhausted at the end of every night. Eventually I arranged a Sauna party here in my town, I was invited with but I had more work to do early next day and really needed some rest.

A few weeks go by when I think I started to make her feel more for me. A national holiday was coming up that is a big going out day. I asked time of from work to go with her. I got a denied and ended up working that day. When she got home the day after she tells right away that she slept with him that night. (the guy I made breakfast for)
Well things turned to shit here. It is now 5 months after and I'm still depressed. I started hanging out with my old friends again but it is really strained as how I alienated them before. I have no problems picking up new girls but it leaves me with feeling like someone who is full of shame.
The only just desert she ending up getting was the she lost her resident permit when she left me. She ending up having to pay 26K$ to finish her last school year. (not to mention that she now has to pay full rent and other costs that I covered for here since she was studying and I was working)

I'm not a hundred percent sure why I'm posting this. I just needed someone to read my story. Input would be nice. I'm feeling incredibly depressed about this and need to find a way to get over it all.

I know it's been a long time but I've finally figured out what my problem is and felt like it would be good to let at least somebody know. And this time I prefer to use my real account instead of some throwaway. I'd also like to thank the people who responded to my original post, but even then I there's no doubt in my mind that this is it. Everything I've read, whether it's symptoms on medical websites, or people sharing their own experiences with this as well, ALL of it describes me, and my life right now to the most perfect T that can be drawn.

[Anhedonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia). The (almost) complete loss of joy or pleasure in doing anything life cause by what is believed to be a breakdown in your brain's reward system. The source of everything wrong in me. And truly one of the most evil things to exist on this planet. Any form of torture is the only other thing I can think of that's worse than this.

I say *almost* complete loss because I do feel some emotion. But only very very slightly. On a scale of 1 to 100, playing a video game, or worst of all, spending time with other people, it all ends with a feeling of 'Yeah that was kind of fun I guess, but I wouldn't feel any different if it hadn't happened.'

There are still a few select emotions I can feel with a little more intensity than that though.

Hopeless in anything and everyone is the only thing I've felt consistently this entire time. It never leaves. I may not notice it sometimes

Frustration every time I try to 'fix' this in some way. I described it in my original post. I try to make myself *feel* this way or that way and in the end no matter what I do, and that very desperate sadness I mentioned earlier.

Jealousy and pure bitterness towards the people I'm spending time with and are somehow getting enjoyment out of what we're doing. They're having fun

And that's it. That's the extent of what I can really feel, then it's starts to go back down again and within 5 minutes I'm back to 'meh' for the rest of the day.

Even though anhedonia is suppose to be the loss of enjoyment in life, frisson or any sensation of any kind, desire, and motivation. Add all this up and you have someone who has no drive for literally anything at all. There is no drive to truly live. In the end there's not really even such a thing as 'living' either. You're not living. You're existing. And that's it. That's all there is.

But there is hope now. I found out what all this was 2 and a half weeks ago, that I went out to the closest park to me and I ran for about 20 minutes. Just simply knowing not only what it is, but that other people are going through the exact same things that I'm going through, that I can't actually help any of it, and more importantly, that it can actually be *fixed* is just a huge relief to me. Like now there's something to look forward to and things really are going to get better. Fixing this is my number one priority in life right now. Nothing else matters. Because as long as this exists, there will be no life for me.

Sorry this took so long. This post and the original make me think I should look into being a writer. But there is a point to all of this. I want more people to know about this. I want to increase the awareness of this in anyway I can for plenty of reasons. Just simply knowing what this is has already helped in tremendous ways. And to think the entire time I was going through everything

And I'm not the only one. Look at the comments in my original post. About half of them are from people saying they're still going through the same thing. And they don't now what it is or why they're that way either. Right before I came here, and that he now knows it's what he's been going through for the past *14 years!!*

14 years..... Just the 2 alone I've been through feel like a tragedy. Like it's the only way to take away someone's life without full blown murdering them. But 14? I can't even think of a word to describe how awful that truly is. And I don't even want to think of a word that could.

But that's my reason for doing this. The more people know about this the better. With it being so unheard of, and there's also plenty of treatment options. This may be a symptom of depression, but there have been plenty of cases where actual depression stops while the anhedonia itself doesn't. And usual medication treatment for depression has shown little to no effect on anhedonia either. So while they're very closely related, they're not entirely the same thing, and should be treated as such.

tl;dr **I have anhedonia, the better it can be for people suffering from it to accept it, and seek more necessary treatment for it.**

**TL;DR: Fell in love at 14


In 2000

Roleplaying in my case, I just was myself, if that makes any sense. But I met this girl there who we can just call Mimi. Instantly there were sparks between us. 


Just: ZANG. Nothing got in the way- not looks


I loved the hell out of her right off the bat. But


Our relationship was chockfull of drama from the very get go however. There was madness in every direction- she was already taken, I cheated, broke up, we fought, made up, got back together, fought, she left me but still loved me so I told her new boyfriend, I cheated


But


I did finally leave her though. She took me back one last time, but I hung out with some theater Nazis, so... It was not different in the slightest. I literally had a mental breakdown because the only people I knew drove me up the fucking wall. I needed something normal, someone who cared. Mimi was extremely distant/preoccupied and I was extremely clingy. She moved on, for the most part, but I was trapped, stuck. I couldn’t grow. I was a fucking mess, I’m still so embarrassed. We had some more really bad tension and drama in college but ultimately she left me and disconnected. This was… 6 years ago. 


Occasionally, says hi, and then inexplicably vanishes for no reason. She’s as dysfunctional as I am. I tried getting in touch with her on Facebook last year and she was acting like a robot to me “Yes.” “No.” and she asked me to buy a 250$ something for her because hey, why not, right? Then she randomly invited me to this event I couldn’t possibly attend and then deleted me when I pressed the patented facebook decline button. If she hates me so much, why does she get curious check in? 


So I haven’t talked or heard from her since Thanksgiving-ish. Which is fine. I’m not stalking her life. 


But I’ve never forgotten her. I miss her a lot. 


It’s been 12 years since we met, met people, went places, grew up and changed a lot, got more comfortable in my own skin, moved on etc. I mean, I’m 26 now and making like, I'm out there *looking* for someone like her. But I’ve never met another girl like her. I’ve had some great


Have I been sabotaging myself? I don’t think so. I’d like to think I’m a pretty good boyfriend when push comes to shove. It’s not like I don’t try. They’re just not the same as my first. I mean,' I know for a fact I'd drop whatever it was I was doing and answer the call with an affirmative. 


And then I see all these ex-gf/bf posts on Reddit and I can’t help but feel bad about myself. It’s like I’ve got some serious dysfunction because I still miss/feel for my first love even after one dozen fucking years. I’ve recently accepted the fact that I still really care about Mimi and nothing will come of it. I’m coping/living life. I just don’t want to feel so alone with the way I am


Does anyone still really have strong feelings towards an ex that they just can’t shake? How do you cope? Do you feel guilty? Have you been friend zoned and dying a slow horrible death?

I do have a somewhat dark past, but I went on antidepressants and I've been generally feeling alright since.  I don't, however, think my childhood was the only cause to my feelings during that time.

I guess this is where I talk about why I'm really here.  Last year was my first class with a teacher that I'll refer to as Mr. I.  Mr. I teaches several grade levels of history at my school.  He's young (between 24-29 I'll say, which is ironic seeing as that the sciences are my strength and interest.  I ended up spending a considerable amount of time with him, in class and after school while waiting for a ride home from one of my parents.  I suppose you can see where this is going.

I developed some serious feelings for Mr. I.  I'm quite hesitant to say love, he's not a Calvin Klein model. I didn't notice him in a romantic way at all when I first started in his class.  I just found him to be funny and a good teacher, so why not spend a little time doing homework in his classroom after school? I soon realized that he’s an extremely balanced and kind person, with both his students and those he is close to in his nonprofessional life.  I have a lot of respect for him. It was only a few months into the school year that I recognized that I had started to care about him in a way that I probably shouldn't.  

He was and is equally fond of me, that I am a hard worker, etc.  We’re on a first name basis outside of school hours.  Despite the undertones I realize that this story is beginning to take on, I truly believe that he has no feelings for me beyond what he would have for any other student.  I’m not under any impression that this is going to result in a happily ever after.

In spite of having a pretty good grip on reality, especially considering he’s never been anything but professional.  I went back and forth between trying to be satisfied with just spending time with him and feeling awful for being unsuccessful at being satisfied with just spending time with him.  This combined with dealing with what I now know to be symptoms of PTSD from my childhood really did a number on my state of mind.

Thankfully, and I have been generally doing better.  It’s so twisted, but Mr. I was actually a huge support for me during that time.  A considerable amount of my upset had been due to how I felt about him, and there he was, patting my back!  It was really strange, but again, he’s a great human being.  He asked no questions and expected nothing in return.

The year was almost over at that point.  It ended without too much change, it had been long enough since I had seen him that I thought I was starting to get over him.  Then I got my class schedule.

It turns out Mr. I requested that I be in his class this year.  Believe me, I can’t seem to just ‘get over it’, and our friendship is seriously suffering.  He’s worried about me again, but I’ve been doing my best to shrug it off, because I know the moment I tell him what’s actually going on is the moment he will be legally and morally required to end whatever the hell this relationship has become.

Between 03-05, so I thought.

Meeting her was the single most powerful moment of my life. Her eyes that night. I knew everything

After a year it only got better as far as I could tell.

Basically it ended because she had developed ""feelings for someone else"". Cheated. Once I brought up the obvious distance, and I only really saw her once more.

Far as I know she married him. She had stayed in the same place for years until

I think her phone might be dead

Situation: I feel like she's avoiding me and I'm freaking out.

I spend a lot of time feeling uneasy about my relationship, but as much as part of the problem is the relationship and the girl, there's definitely part of it which is my own insecurity and lack of independence.

Right now I should be doing a job application for an amazing audio position, wondering if it's all in my head etc.

Realistically, and that makes me wonder what's up with my head.

I don't know where this stems from. I just feel alone. Like I can't talk to anyone very easily but I actually do. I talk about problems or things on my mind far too easily with those I know. They then try to give the quickest solution and then move on to what's bothering them and then there are those kinds that just want me to move on to my next problem without really opening up about themselves even if I probe; this is after we've exhausted any other common topics. I feel tired of this superficial interaction. It's like that line from Fight Club

I'm a female in my mid-twenties. I'm increasingly finding it difficult to put up a face. My closest friend from my high school days and I have pretty much drifted apart. However

And talking about attention from the opposite sex, I do feel like I want someone that will just be there whenever I want and I did have this sort of a relationship with a friend miles away. Although it was over phone or web, the interactions seemed genuine, exciting and well, he was there when I usually needed him. This then went on to an abrupt end from his side as he didn't want to continue being just friends and we couldn't be anything more. I don't know. I'm just generally of the opinion that serious relationships are useless unless they are the one you want to wind up spending the rest of your life with and frankly, I haven't met anyone like that and I kinda seem to not want to, given my lack of solo happiness achievement. I don't know if any of this makes sense. I guess I think it's a weakness of sorts to rely on others, yet I do seek these sort of interactions and wind up fucking it up or being disappointed with it all. I'm sorry it's all a massive convoluted rant. I've just been getting annoyed at everyone around me and myself. I really want to be happy with myself and by myself but I sort of do yearn for a connection that I had with the friend that was miles away. I guess humans are social creatures and want some sort of interaction with others and that's why people get pets and aren't just happy spending time with books and music

P.S: Also, needy shit that I don't want to think about as I'm not normally like that and have in fact scolded friends of mine for being that way in their interactions with dates and now feel let down by myself and hypocritical.). I also happen to think giving in to emotions is a weakness and I've always tried not to do that. And recently, I've just teared up a few times while speaking to said fling as I actually fucked up majorly and this is painting an uncharacteristic picture of me. I don't know what to do anymore apart from pushing this all aside and just diving headfirst into work and hobbies. Ah but here's the thing, I've not been able to properly focus on stuff of late either. Feeling very pissed off with myself for all this. I generally place logic and rationality over wishy-washy emotions and feelings. Those things are so very transient anyway.

When I was about 14-18 years old I kind of 'accepted' my nose and I felt really good about myself - I really didn't care any longer about any negative remarks (and I did not get any either since I apparently no longer cared about what other people said). I figured out that my nose wasn't all that bad, I got real bad acne that lasted until my mid 20's. Now my skin has cleared up, but I (again) hate my nose. It is too prominent and I hate to look at myself in the mirror. Not only that, all the acne products had dried out my skin and I've gotten a few wrinkles as well. The result is that I hate my nose AND I feel like I look much older than I really am. My friends say that my 'wrinkles'/lines are hardly noticeable or even non-existing, and that I don't look neither old nor ugly. But how can I believe them when the mirror says otherwise? Recenly, my friend's 5-year old kid called me 'Pinocchio' , because of my nose. I just laughed at it

It's been many years since I've felt good about my looks, or whatever. It's been years since I've felt good and confident. I can hardly remember the last time. It is bothering me, because I want my confidence back again. 

I've registred on OKC, since I don't believe that they are genuine. I just want to feel good about myself, so therefore I have no need for compliments when I am not able to believe them. I've had some boyfriends and some other guys that think that I am beautiful/whatever, but the only explanation for that, as far as I can see, is that they are either blind or have poor taste.

I considered plastic surgery but I've come to the conclusion that (I've imagined how they would fix it) it would look unnatural and/or even worse. So I just have to live with it. It is REALLY hard to accept that you're ugly, but the face I see every day, I feel like it is not 'me'. I've changed since my teens, but not for the good. Because of my low self-esteem and shitty self-image I am not as social as I wish to be, and I rarely meet new people, or hang out much (in public at least) with the friends that I already have.

I feel as though my parents were/are un-intentionally abusive to me and my brother. We both grew up with severe anxiety, we've both grown up to be decently well-adjusted adults. We both have our bachelors degrees and we both have a good amount of friends. We both definitely have our quirks though. I grew up with terrible self esteem and zero confidence, and through no help from my parents I have for the most part overcome that. The only time I revisit those feelings tend to be when I'm around my parents. I feel as though I am a better person away from them, and I think my brother probably feels the same way. Anytime I spend around either of my parents, I leave feeling negative, bad about myself, and anxious. I love traveling for this reason

Our parents ""love"" us and support us materialistically as much as they can. I also know they worry about us a lot. But there's just this overwhelming negative weight in their presence. My mom is very judgmental and my dad worries about money CONSTANTLY. 90% of my dad and I's conversations are just stressing over what to do about my bills, my financial plans, my 401k, etc. Anytime I try to talk to either of my parents about stuff that makes me happy and interests me such as my friends, art, movies, music, books

I should also mention neither of my parents have any sense of humor. Zero.

Also, and WAS a promising tennis player. I WAS a promising artist, dancer, tennis player, and pianist. I'm not going to wallow in self-pity because I know I am still very young and can pick back up... but I quit doing all of these things I loved in my mid-teen years due to pressure to be the best and a constant feeling of not being good enough. 

Now both of my parents are older (in their 60s) and I am 23. My mom will probably live to be about 150 and my dad probably won't live another decade. He has terrible health problems and is on 24 hr oxygen due to a lifetime of smoking cigarettes. He can barely take care of himself and generally has this toxic attitude of self-pity and negativity and helplessness.

Now I have learned from my parents exactly what attitude NOT to have in life. But when I am around them it just drags me down. My problem here is that they have never been maliciously downright abusive. It is all very under the table. I know my mother's parents were both crazy and her dad was physically abusive. The way she is surely isn't her fault. She is pretty damn cold and non-understanding nonetheless. When I started my period

I don't think I would be able to deal with the guilt of leaving my good-intentioned? father in his state of health alone (parents are divorced). But god damnit I hate to admit it life is so much better and light and optimistic with my family out of my mind.

I have spent the greater part of the last 10 years learning to overcome my own social anxiety and lack of self-esteem/confidence as well as improve my sense of humor and communication skills by myself ....and to much avail. My only digression ever is turning back to my family.

1.Family- Dad is emotionally abusive. Mom is a door mat. They work at the same place, almost 80% of the times, they have a screaming match going on and this has been happening since 6 years. I don't know what changed then. I have sheltered my sibling as much as I could. We have spent way too many nights crying ourselves to sleep. Also, since a couple of years, my grandmother has been staying with us cuz my grandpa passed away :( We can *not* put her in an oldage home. She and my mother never got along well. She(granny) loves to brew up fights between my parents. The thing is she's sneakily manipulative and they know it but still fall for it. It's all too WTF and frustrating to tolerate. Also, it has made us very very cynical in life.

2. Me- I am moody. Very. At times I am happy, yet have little work experience. It terrifies me. The thought of working. As in I literally panic and start sobbing. I know it's pathetic, but for the love of God, I wish I knew why. Also, that internship at my parents' office was a nightmare. My dad thinks I am a useless good-for-nothing since I am currently sitting at home. Money is not that low, that I *must* earn. He just wants me out. Who wouldn't? I get that. But he constantly taunts me and in front of everyone. And then there are times when he's sweet and concerned like a normal father. My mom will say/agree with everything he says about this. I have told her a million times that her adding to it, doesn't help at all. I am a very communicative person. They know everything about how I feel. There's no doubt at all that I am very troubled by the tension in the house and how much they are pressurising me. Yet they do *nothing* to help.

3. Love- So obviously I was with a guy who loved me and never pointed out anything wrong in me. That ended though. We realized how dysfunctional we were behaving. But now I am worried I will always go for guys who give me approval. I do not want that. I have seen people belittling their own selves based on other people's opinions. Also, no way.

Okay

This is going to be a long read for you

I was sort of in a relationship a couple of years ago

Since then

Here is my problem: 
I have girl friends

Then there are girls who I can see myself in a relationship with. Can I talk to any of these girls? No. 

Why?

Because I'm terrible at conversing with these girls

I don't know

Face to face I'm one boring mofo. Over the internet I'm more open for some reason. I have this thing where my face completely flushes red in awkward situations with girls. It just makes me feel agitated and uncomfortable and they are probably thinking 'wtf is wrong with him' which really doesn't help. 

Why is it so hard to talk or even start a conversation with a girl? 

How can I become more confident at talking to girls/strangers. Part of the reason I think I'm so bad at is because I'm worried that they won't like me or think I'm just a prick. I just want to say fuck it

I'm in a four year relationship with a guy I met at 17, who wants to live a normal and happy life. Wants the house, the wife, the kids and he wants that all with me. He's perfect on paper and in public, and behind closed doors he's a nervous wreck with OCD and control issues. 

We have been on shaky ground for two years. He's very possessive and has been from day one, the constant phone calls and the jealousy and the guilt trips about spending time with anyone but him wore me down. I have no life experiences. No previous lengthy relationships like him, no overseas travels like him, no partying like him, no nothing. I don't need another father, I have a good one.

I literally feel sickened by his touch. I fell in love with someone else. Not infatuation, and he's quite similar. I want to be with him so badly it hurts. Our relationship was discovered by my SO and he is shattered. Under all his grief, I saw that wholesome person who has his own problems, and I saw that I was responsible for picking away any progress he might have made by cavorting about with someone else. He was already insecure and paranoid, and I have proven to him that he has every reason to be.

I am still here with him

I’ve fallen into this pattern with my relationships with close guy friends. I’ll get a guy friend who eventually becomes my best friend – my confidant. I tell him everything, and I hate it. I feel betrayed by them, and guilty – I don’t ask for them to like me. I can’t make myself like them. It hurts everyone. I’m not even a pretty girl – I don’t know why this keeps happening.

This doesn’t bother me until later on though. Early on we agree that we only see each other as brother and sister.

The year progresses and we come to the night of a mutual friend’s 21st. He doesn’t usually drink

We talk the next day when we’re both sober, is mysteriously absent from our group of friends, ect.

I'm currently nearing the end of my first semester of my final year of high school. The previous year in my last semester of school, but last year I really dropped the ball; not studying for exams at all, handing in essays and papers with nothing more than a paragraph of text, etc. I was horribly lazy, and ended up getting C's or D's in most of my subjects. Luckily for me, where I live, only the final year of highschool counts towards my exit mark.

Since the beginning of this year I have managed to mostly pull myself out of my depressed state and take school a bit more seriously. I have been going well; finishing assignments and completing exams at a satisfactory standard, either, it's very lengthy and involves lots of coding and documentation and such. There's no way I can do this and get anything better than an E.
Things have been fine all up until now. I've dipped back into depression again after a relationship with a good friend going horribly wrong last week.

I would like to blame my lack of motivation on that, and I'm seriously afraid of life after school; how will I do in uni if I go, will I be able to hold up a job, etc.

Ok before I start I want to say that I am willing to expand on anything I write just let me know and I will explain in greater detail. 

Some info about me, studying computer science, meh build (but I have been working out regularly for a year now and have lost 40 pounds,) Indian (red-dot, flying-carpet kind :P)

So for the confessions

I am not embarrassed of any of those things but I believe that the information may be important. 

Note: I am writing this with humbleness aside

I as a guy am what almost all of my female friends have called, kind, accepting, smart, funny, ect, ect

As a kid I was taught to be helpful and loving and that is exactly what I do

I do this with EVERYBODY I consider a friend. 

I am perfectly happy with who I am

Now this leads into my girl problems. I am not a self fulfilling prophecy guy. I can't see myself with a woman (ever) but at the same time I know this is what I want from life

I have been shot down multiple times (7 in the past two months) and am always met with, there is some girl out there that will be super lucky to find you one day!” Hell I have had one woman literally say to me, “You are everything I have ever imagined in a man... what did I do to deserve you?” I feel like this mystical woman is more rare than a bloody unicorn-dodo hybrid at this point. 

Even though I am aware of all of these things I still feel like I am doing something wrong, I don't drink, I don't talk about women in sexual ways. I am not saying these things are bad (they aren't) but I find that there are a lot of things “typical guys” do that I don't. On the flip side I am no prissy boy either. I can fix cars (to a certain degree,) I enjoy yard work, and I think explosions are cool. I have soft palms (because I am a programmer) but I don't let this stop me from doing hard work from time to time. 

It is also common knowledge that I am a romantic. Sure I have never gotten to do anything for my girlfriends (*cough*) but I have helped plenty of my guy friends plan romantic dates and just romantic deeds. I know how to be sweet and what not.

I don't lock up in front of women, I pull out chairs, I complement them, and I show them respect.

A few months ago one of my friends who is a research psychologist and has been working on his PHD thesis asked me to help him out. He is doing research in the area of attraction, “Too good to be true.” I don't let this get to my head (especially since it is an unpublished study) but him and I did have a good laugh about it. 

Back to them women. On top of all of this I don't chase those typical

In all honesty I am at a loss for words, and I have no real big issues with myself (other than I wish I was a better programmer but I am actively working on this.)  

One of my female friends recently brought up an angle I have never thought about but I feel like as if I should dismiss it. She says that because I actually am genuinely nice that most women may find it intimidating and scary. She summed it up by saying that women might believe that I am hiding something and that I really am a scumbag under this “ruse.” I kind of find this silly but it was something that made me think. 

So my question is

I'm not like that. I talk to people and joke around in school. I occasionally get invited to events, a certain topic to research online, a game.

I'm very driven and am mostly successful because I spent much of my teen years and early 20s living as some sort of productivity monk. In short, and most of them were far less productive than I.

These two things have come to a head in recent months. I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year, such as leaving clothes in a pile for a few days after washing them, but it's nothing major. She's never really had a steady job or career for more than a few years, mostly because she's gotten annoyed by some aspect of them and quit.

Now she's 31, they say that she will remain directionless and needy. I feel like we've helped each other out: she's pulled me out of my shell to interact with her friends, and I've helped motivate her to keep working despite various major and minor annoyances. This parental approval problem been the only major and consistent source of tension in our relationship.

I'm very close to my family and trust their opinion. Most of their wisdom is usually right when I ask for advice, and I'm poor Berlin.

I am 33/m. I date an average amount and don't have a problem meeting new women. I'll enjoy spending time with them for a few days but then I completely lose interest. I need to stress that this has NOTHING to do with sex. I don't lose interest because I have or haven't had sex with them.

I've been in a couple of long term relationships. One was approximately 4 years on and off. The other was a year and a half. In both relationships we lived together for a large portion of the time. Even when I was in those long term relationships I wasn't emotionally attached to the women. I stayed with them out of comfort instead of satisfaction. I never had a wandering eye or wanted to see how green the grass was on the other side

I'm afraid that I'll always be this way and it scares me. I'm so used to being alone that I don't know if I can adapt and share my life with someone else. In the last 2 years or so this has become very stressful and I get depressed often.

Please help me out.",EmotionsAreHard,5,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/ts481/when_it_comes_to_emotions_i_am_an_idiot_please/, I started college continuing to suppress my emotions as I had for years and totally ignoring the possibility of relationships. That worked out pretty well for the first year and a half. I got depressed every so often, while beneficial in some ways

This is the toughest thing I've ever done. Emotions are so strong, and free, but I hate myself for it because I know it's a step backwards.

**What happened recently has me eager to curl back up into the safety of suppression and I need some help stopping myself from doing it.**

A few months ago I contacted an old friend on Facebook. After the years we spent together, and largely have forgotten due to suppression. But I actually want to remember the things we did together. I can't stress enough how unique that is for me. I spent so long trying to escape from my past, thinking every moment of it was painful, that when I eventually remembered the happier years with her, it was overwhelming. 

We were both busy with college until recently, and actually started texting, but most of our conversations involved figuring out when we would both be available to Skype. During this time, I had no reason to think she didn't want to reminisce about our past. I became happy whenever I heard from her. The happiness was entirely fueled by nostalgia, and I logically knew this, but I told myself that happiness is still happiness even if it's caused my something as pathetic as nostalgia. These emotions, these memories were so damn powerful. The conversation we'd have on Skype was entirely different in my imagination than what actually happened.

She didn't want to reminisce. She barely even talked, I talked to her enough before this to know that she's genuinely nice. She really didn't seem to be talking to me out of pity, and I still don't think she was. She was actually the one to suggest we start texting, so if she wanted to stop hearing from me she did a bad job at it. But what she intended to happen in our Skype conversation, and what I intended, were clearly very different. I wanted to catch up, to get to know each other again, that's still doable. She just wasn't as interested in talking about the past as I was. 

I feel absolutely pathetic. What the fuck is wrong with me. I didn't contact her with any sort of romantic intentions in mind, happier era of my past that I could barely have a regular conversation with this girl. I felt emotions, caused by powerful happiness inducing memories that she didn't really want to talk about. I realized this is because she, like most more normal people, doesn't have the kind of mental split that I do. It's not common to have happy memories, then painful memories of abuse until adulthood. Why reminisce about childhood memories when all of your good AND bad memories are mixed together in one life, while I feel like I've had three already? Happy childhood with her, and adulthood

I want to just give up on emotions. Again. These emotions were so distracting, I think. I put up a very, very good front that I've worked on for years. Nobody I haven't confided to would know or ever assume this kind of shit is wrong with me. I just... what do I do now? Now that this little experiment in time travel is over? Now that I know how fucking pathetic emotions can make me, someone who can think calmly and logically when his emotions are successfully suppressed? I want to be a normal person, but clearly I'm NOT a normal person when under the influence of emotions, with my currently level of control anyway. I already see a talk therapist. I'll certainly bring this up with her next time I see her. But this happened very recently, and I just need some advice sooner rather than later.

 I grew up in a poor and absuive family, can be really naive... I tend to be really, really leniant on others, making a billion excuses for them, but I will tear myself a new asshole over the littlest mistake.

 I'm a perfectionist and am always rushing to do more and more. My life history is filled with moments where I worked myself to exhaustion and I look back on those times and say

 As a child I was a gifted person... I scored very high on IQ and Emotional IQ tests and in Grade 1 was offered to be put ahead a grade. My mother said no, though, is that I was already being bullied and I was lying to her about being popular. What eventually happened was that I would spend my mornings in the Grade 1/2 class doing the Grade 2 curriculum but technically being in Grade 1 and spending my afternoons in the Grade 5/6 class studying English and science and doing crafts. Even back then I was very emotionally fragile (I still am, but I have learned to hide it well) and would cry at the drop of a hat over the smallest social injustice, or if I was bullied, or if something emotionally aroused me too deeply.

 I have a postgraduate degree in my field and literally have a dream job (a job that people oooh and ahhhh and get all sparkly-eyed over when I mention the company and position) but I still feel like an enormous loser.

 People scare me easily. Usually I find myself anticipating the moment that they will reject me and I close up... Whenever I find someone that can get me to be open and have fun I become extremely attached. Recently I developed extremely deep feelings for a guy who was like this but in the end he rejected me.

 I spend a lot of time alone, x body part is the wrong shape, etc. I work out like crazy and range between the low side of average and slightly underweight for my height (and I am quite toned) but my diet is absolute shit... 99% of my diet is coffee, chocolate, fish, yogourt and vegetables (not together, LOL)... I binge eat regularly due to the level of stress that I typically experience.

 In general I experience a lot of shame over my personality. I feel like I am so different from others that I will never find peers who can truly accept me for who I am. In general people get close to me because I can offer them acceptance but they can't do the same for me...

Now that I am older (24) I still don't have a close girl who is a friend that we just hang out and do stuff. Or a girlfriend for that matter.

My friends invite me along to a lot of different parties where I meet new girls and have a great time though it never changes from that. We know each other say hi have a chat and a laugh (I am also a standup comedian) enjoy each others company though it ends there. Ill see them next time and have a chat and its a vicious cycle.

The girls I know well and have been friends with for a long time. Nothing else. When I knew most of them initially they were all in relationships but since most of them are now single.

What concerns me the most here is that if people that have known me for ages and enjoy my company/ personality still do not want me around on a one on one basis.

This makes me feel like im a creep or something which is not the case I assure you.

In fact I doubt very few people even think that I worry about these things. On outward appearance I have a very busy social life with lots of girls and guys. Though my close group of friends know that I have not had many gf's or held a relationship like that for longer then 6 months.

Alright

She was very passionate and forward with her advances

Because of this

This sort of thing helped to ruin what was probably the best relationship I ever had

Now let's get down to the story.

Just before spring break

We met at the school library and really hit it off. I was in a relationship at the time, a police officer, was shot and killed in the line of duty around Thanksgiving and she said she couldn't handle the stress of a relationship on top of all the other fallout she was dealing with).

I came back from spring break no longer having to bear the guilt of possible infidelity (something I had promised myself never to do after my parents divorced) and wound up having an 8-hour impromptu date the day afterward. We were in almost constant contact for the next week, it felt like much longer.

I was still a bit awkward when it came to relationships. I told her I liked her almost right away

On our second real date

&gt;Just so you know, but I think we need to have time to start as friends. Don't rush things blindly. You're still young. You have much to learn.

Then we proceed to have another date at the movie theater

It would seem that afterward her best friend (whom I've never met) talked with her and convinced her afterward to give me another chance. We picked ourselves back up where we had left off and had lots of fun together again.

We continued to hang out all the time, and so I poked her back, and pretty soon she was trying to tickle me and I was trying to tickle her and we wound up wrestling with one another in her car.

Eventually

When I got home

The ""friend"" word caught me a bit off-guard; I knew she said she had wanted to wait, but her replies suddenly became spotty and short. I asked if she was alright, and she said that she ""doesn't reply to every text,"" something that had never been a problem before.

I saw her today

Apparently, and she told me not to wait for her anymore, either.

I've never been the strongest guy around. In fact, either (I'm 6 feet tall [~2 meters] and my BMI is ~~1~~ 23, I must've been looking at the wrong thing).

Giving someone a bruise and scaring them is a bit of a shock for me, and because I swore to myself I would never become that type of guy. I never once hit her, but the shock of seeing that *my* actions led to her getting a bruise (on her wrist) and her saying she was scared to just be around me nearly led to me posting on [/r/SuicideWatch](/r/SuicideWatch) if an old friend whom I hadn't talked to in ages hadn't managed to calm me down.

She knows it wasn't on purpose, but now I'm scared because this was the first time I've ever had someone become legitimately *afraid* of me due to my actions. She had told me she really liked me just before it happened, and now I'm scared that I've gone and fucked up everything.

I've decided to give her space and time to think. I don't see her until Tuesday (at the time of writing

I've told myself I'm not going to text her anymore until she initiates the conversation, to no avail).

I need help

I've been abused and picked on all my life, or taking things farther than I ever intended. I **never** want to do it again. I **never** want to have this happen to me again.

Giving her space is the only thing I can think of that I can do

1. **Can anything be done to salvage our relationship?** I really liked her, although since I've actually caused physical harm I doubt it).

2. **Can I do anything to keep this from happening again?** I never want to do this to anyone. I *don't* want to be that kind of guy. Being 18, a combination of bouncing between 2 houses, a full schedule at school, and a job leaves me with very little time to seek out any therapy sessions. I used to see a psychologist back when I was with the possessive bi-polar girl I mentioned at the start of my post, and I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and co-dependency. Outside of medication, is there any way I can make sure this *never* happens again?

**tl;dr: I apparently bruised and scared a girl yesterday by accidentally going too far in a wrestling match. I need help to make sure I never scare anyone again.** I don't think I could handle it.

- I currently live in someone's garage

I would be fulfilling a dream.

I think I have pretty decent social skills. I smile, and I generally try to be polite.


But something is driving me crazy. I always seem to have a horrible sense of timing


For example: I often find myself in a situation where I'm with a group of people who are talking about something and I have something relevant to say. Naturally I listen to the people speaking and wait till they finish expressing a complete idea and then I try to chime in. It's right then that other people will start talking right over me. I usually end up just shutting up. I figure that I'm not wanted in the conversation, is very low.


Second example, something happens. Either the commercial will end and the show will come back on, or we'll pull into a gas station and everyone gets out, or someone else will walk up and join the group, causing everyone to stop listening to me in order to greet the new person.


Third example: I was on a podcast once with some friends. There were four of us. I was pretty quiet during the podcast as I either didn't get a chance to say anything


It just really hurts me. I know when I'm not wanted, empathetic, and caring. It just absolutely destroys any sense of self worth that I have.


It really came out this weekend when I took a trip with some friends. There were 4 of us in the car and yet almost the entire conversation was a triangle. I just sat there in my little corner thinking ""I'm not invited to this conversation.""

Now, I just feel terribly insecure about everything. I sometimes feel I'm not good enough for her, and sometimes I feel like she'd rather have another guy rather than me.

It causes me great pain to think like that, but they never even actually met. I'm actually her first boyfriend, and while she's not my first girlfriend, she's the first girl I've done anything sexual with.

I just saw that early in the relationship (say, saying ""Most guys are assholes,"", etc. I'd be a liar if I didn't try that with a female friend as well. But he then said to her ""I'd still totally do you, I guess the feeling isn't mutual."" Then she replied ""Maybe so, haha."" 

The next day he tries to initiate a sext or something with her, probably not."" He then asked ""Oh, well, everything's better with him then?"" To which she replied ""Yeah, just the distance is annoying."" After that, the guy never texted her again, but was friends on facebook after that.

She kept the guy as a friend on facebook because he needed someone to tell issues to, so she went ahead and deleted him. But it made me feel like a villain, although that's honestly something I think will help with me, considering the circumstances.

There are other things that bug me as well, but she says mine is the nicest she's ever seen. Another thing, not related, but she says she'd have a threesome outside of a relationship, which made me nervous that since we've been in a relationship for so long, maybe I was keeping her from experiencing things she'd like to try, but I'm not comfortable with the idea of a threesome. She said that's totally fine, just because she'd feel jealous as well.

I just need to know if I should feel insecure. Sure, kissed once, and then we were official. But maybe I feel insecure because of a few reasons: 1) When we really went on our first date, I stopped looking around at other girls because I really enjoyed the time I spent with her. And 2) I've had an ex cheat on me before, and it's ruined my trust. I was 17 at the time, but it still hurt pretty bad.

Maybe I feel insecure because of my own self-esteem issues? I'm not in the best of shape

EDIT: Also, although one was dated around the time we had one date. That made me feel a bit insecure too, but I don't think I should even worry considering we'd only really just rekindled a friendship at that point. Just an addition.

r/ihaveissues

TL;DR- Girlfriend used to send pics to a dude before we dated. I've seen a pic or two she's sent from before we dated, but she says mine is the nicest she's ever seen. After that, she stopped the guy when he tried to get explicit. I have my own self-esteem issues from being overweight. I'm also her first boyfriend, she's my third, but only one I've done anything sexual with. I've been cheated on before, and it's given me trust issues.

The last 4 times I have gone drinking, but I didn't call him between 9 to 4 a.m. and he was VERY angry.  After this happened, I promised never to do this again, and I meant it.  

There was a period of time about 2 years ago where we were having issues and I engaged in this sort of behavior--I would go out and stay out late and not call him.  It caused a lot of problems

Well, but on the way there was a bar nearby I had wanted to check out, so I stopped for another drink quickly.  

You probably realize what happened--a drink turned to two.  I started talking to a couple of ladies at the bar and the bartender bought me a buy-back.  That's all I remember until I woke up on the floor of the two ladies' hotel room at 7 a.m. this morning. 

Thank goodness I was fully dressed and they were nice enough to let me crash.  Apparently I was very inebriated and they took me to their nearby hotel for me to sleep it off.  But I don't remember ANYTHING.  Nothing after that buy-back.  I booked it out of the room and headed home.  I tried to call my boyfriend on the cabbie's cell

Needless to say, but I don't know if anything I say can convince him otherwise.  I PROMISED that this wouldn't happen ever again, and it did, not even a month later.  He feels that I am showing him that I don't think of him and that I don't care, which is untrue, but I can see how my behavior would lend itself to that conclusion. 

Is there any hope here?  How do I show him that I'm willing to change and that this WILL NOT EVER HAPPEN AGAIN?? I can imagine how upset he must have been last night

I love him so much and thought we would spend the rest of our lives together.  After 8 years

I'm really upset and sad and preparing for the worst.  He hasn't come home

Like many others here,9,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/r3xwb/16m_im_overly_sensitive_depressed_ugly_anxious/,"I'm 16 and a junior in high school now, and this story really starts out in 5th grade. I have depression, and I was too ashamed to tell this story I'm about to tell. My OCD was really bad when I was like 7/8 and my parents got divorced. I had a weird feeling that they and my sister were going to die all the time



Anyway
So In 5th grade, to protect people I know by these names. Weird, I know, but  it was horrible when I was younger) So, Mike had a weird disorder/problem where he would cry A LOT over nothing. Very little things that are insignificant. He's been very good recently; doesn't cry at all now, but he has hurt himself and does deal with depression, I think. James is like an average kid, I started being friends with a kid named Edwin (who would later sell me out; in 8th grade he spreaded horrible rumors about me, and we would make fun of them behind their back

Now here is the horrible part
When I was 12 and once when I was 13 (7th grade and once in 8th) I touched my friends, and I've tried to be really nice to Mike's sister, when my friends have called her annoying or made fun of her (including Mike) I won't join in, because laughing about someone who you sexually abused is NOT something I would ever do. People think it's weird that I defend her and stuff, and not just joke along; but I feel like it's the least I can do.

Here's what makes it even worse:
Every year, the nice weather lifts my depression, and I feel so nice. My surroundings and the weather really impact my mood, which is another reason why I might be the depressed person I am) I talk to her about things on my mind; except for this story and you'll see why.
My aunt has bipolar disorder. When she has her episodes, and Mike's sister is about 2 years younger) When she was older (not sure how old, or where this happened; but I figured out from my dad and cousin) my aunt was raped. I think this may have sparked her bipolar episodes later, and it must have really hurt her) When she had bipolar episodes, she told me that her feeling of hatred and likeness of people are magnified greatly. These two women took advantage of her so much. They acted like her friends and used her feelings of friendship for them. and because of my aunt's amazing generocity, made her buy RIDICULOUS amounts of stuff for them. One woman hit on her all the time, and tried to make her feel a sexual attraction to her. These two women were evil, she told them how she needed time for herself

I feel like these people that did this to my aunt; and I hate myself for it. I talked shit about my friends
I told my friends ""Sorry if I've ever done anything to hurt you"" because I'm ashamed but all they've siad is ""It's fine"" or ""I can't remember anything you did""
Am I betraying my aunt

My friends and acquaintances call me nice. Lots of people call me sweet and think I'm the kind of person who wouldn't hurt a fly. My parents and my aunt that I mentioned earlier think I'm the most innocent, and I probably act like one too. The only truth in all of that is that I'm sensitive and that I wouldn't hurt a fly (at least I wouldn't intentionally anymore)
I feel like I'm lying to all these people because of their opinion of me. They don't know the darker side of my life and I HATE MYSELF FOR IT SO MUCH. My past haunts me all the time.
I my friends have a shitty life all because of me
Not to mention in 6th grade I made fun of this girl
Also, and the floor has not been washed, I will walk around that spot. I'm even hesitant to watch youtube videos from that time period. What does this mean?


I'm afraid to have a girlfriend because I'm extremely sensitive. I don't want to date someone just to fuck them. I want to have a relationship with someone who I really connect to, and we can love eachother. I'm deeply afraid of getting my heart broken. I'll be hesitant in the relarionship, because I don't want someone who knows everything about me to just leave me. I know I'll be the heartbroken, not the heartbreaker. And if my love leaves me, it wil be hard to find another girl who would even consider dating an ugly,pathetic piece of shit like me.",,,,

Lets see if this post will get on decently... Long!


Anyway, male, decent looking, bit of a posture problem but whatever. He never had a relationship and is a virgin and ~~terribly~~ shy to boot. Was interested in a woman who sent mixed signals and is terribly happy not to have made a decent move on her. God, what a bombshell dodged.

Synopsis

* Since young it felt like a wall was in front of me
* Never learned to make deep/true connections to people
* Never learned to try to cross borders (protective parents!!)
* Somehow managed to have a few friends in the lower-grade school
* As a result
* Moreover
* After that found a job I love(?)
* I have a room over there in which I used to sleep/eat/?? during the week
* Worked there for a year
* At this psychiatrist (P1) I was tested for autism, oh well, couldn't hurt, I guess""). Disbelief for me.
* I began to feel a pressure about two years later on the chest (like a bit of a fight to hold shit in).
* Meanwhile went on a vacation (October 2011, to the USA) on which I had a crush on a female, I think she liked me too but for now that doesn't matter because she is ~~a bigger idiot than I thought~~ at most a friend, I found that out two hours ago, doesn't even feel that bad so I guess it was insecurity speaking here all the time ;)
* Anyway, felt like a wreck the day after, this happened about three times. Also during the day, at which I decided to return to my parents.
* This happened about 5/6 times more in January, two hours to recuperate), felt afterwards like I woke up from a deep sleep. Haven't had those this month thank some agnostic deity!
* Since then I literally feel shaky (at times) and can't handle all this feelings
* Right now they plan to get me a psychologist
* And there I am


By the way, since begin this year I am ill, starting to work slowly once again but my brain keeps getting distracted.


It doesn't make any sense at all that I don't go out there and do shit for once! **Damn it**. I want to do so many things but this terrible brain doesn't help at all! I want to live damn it! Have fun, I don't even know if I am hetero or maybe bi.


And laugh about that silly crush on that woman (situation she is in is fucked up now but oh well, stupid, stupid, woman, bah)


I really, do some (software) engineering projects and see much of the world. Someone who could join me would be nice but that is not the focus now.

I don't want to betray anyone or imply anything that is untrue, I can remove it via edit or post deletion. Furthermore

I am a very closed-off person who thinks an incredible amount about every situation, but definitely contributed/defined who I am. I am young (21) and realize I have a lot of life to look forward to, but my outlook on life is quite different than most and my approach is definitely in a minority.

I am extremely poor at conversing with people (and avoid it) because I receive no stimulation from chatting. For this reason

I have recently become close friends with a girl who is in a long relationship. She has opened the world to me and I sincerely appreciate that (there is no cheating involved or condoned; talking and certain experiences have caused this). However, there is definitely attraction between us, but both of us know what is at stake and merely converse about what could have happened. Self-control is key on both sides.

She has earned my heart, but know I would not be able to live up to what she expects or needs even though I'd be willing to try (this is not the purpose of this post).

This girl has become a great part of my life whether or not she knows it. I don't want to steal her; in fact, as it is shaking my core. I have gained new understandings and appreciations toward life, but am confused because this is the way I would view the heart talking purely and have never experienced this before.

In terms of a relationship (and as someone who is very unfamiliar with them), amazing person I know, and needs to know this.

How should I expect to ever find someone of her calibre?

I have never met someone so perfect for me and I love him. I do however have problems of my own. 

I feel sexually frustrated for reasons I'm still trying to fully understand, no penetration; it happened maybe 3-5 times and I stood up to him saying I would tell. When I was 15, I was acting out (hormones, mother leaving) causing my dad and stepmom to go through my room. They found things I'd written that strongly implied what had happened all those years ago. Long story short, my brother is a registered sex offender. This was just so long ago that it happened. Me and him didn't talk for a long time, and now we do. He is married and has 2 kids and his wife knows about this shameful part of our past, obviously. **Sexual molestation at age 6 by brother age 13

My SO has met my brother once so far and they really hit it off. I want to tell my SO about this, I guess I just want to share it with him to feel relief, and closer to him. But I don't know how he will feel about my brother and I don't want to create tension between them. I have fully forgiven my brother, I love him and there's no changing what's been done. **I want SO and brother (friend) to cont. getting along, but feel like I need to tell him of the past** 

Also, because he was good for that. This 'begging' became harassment and I ended up getting a protection order a few months before me and my SO were together. **Ex from 2 years ago used me for sex, I let him therefore making it ok in my mind for sex to be the only way of showing attraction**

When I met my SO it was the week after my sister died. She was my best friend and the whole situation was so stressful as she was my room mate and I had to make a hasty decision to move me and my 3 cats into one room. I've been an emotional wreck because of this ordeal, dealing with legal reminders in the mail of my ex - they kept me updated). **It's been a rough fucking year.**  

I feel like I met him at the worst time of my life. In the beginning I thought he was just trying to be nice to the obviously angry girl, and 4 times too many. I tell him he needs to make more effort, but the thing is he's perfect. How confusing is that message? It's not fair to him at all. He doesn't care about fucking, he cares about an emotional connection, and I love this. But when I'm insecure I interpret it as he doesn't think I'm attractive. I've told him that I learned this logic from staying with the ex, but it's just an excuse to me. **I need to make more of an effort in sex (ie I want it, I get it myself for once). I'm not being fair. And I think the more deep seeded issue here is the childhood. It may have not been a horror story

I've ranted, but this is my first post and I thought this was appropriate. Any advice or whatnot from anyone in similar situations to mine would be appreciated, but the point was...
**How and when if ever should I tell the SO about my childhood? If it were you learning this about your SO would you still feel comfortable around the brother? Do you think I'm creating extra drama when it's entirely unnecessary?** I ask that because I am dealing with a lot, but sometimes I feel like a giant toddler. I feel I should also mention that my bro and I are friends, but he's busy, I'm busy, and we see each other maybe 6 times a year.

We had some serious problems in February. She wasn't happy, we were both virgins. Not one week after that, we broke up and she had sex with the guy she had been seeing. 

After that, and there's more honesty in the relationship, and I feel as though there is potential for it to be better than ever. However, she does what she wants, even knowing that it'll upset me. She's known from the start that I don't like drinking or smoking weed. She's been into drinking before, and I guess she enjoys it. All of her friends smoke weed and drink. I've never met any of her friends, because she says I wouldn't like them. She's tried smoking

She doesn't care that it's important to me that she doesn't do these things, but am I out of line for being upset that she doesn't seem to care how her actions make me feel? It's hard for me since we made it so long before any of this became a problem.

A little background on me: I come from a loving home or close enough to it. My dad always made a decent living so my sister and I never lacked for anything we needed. But now that I've graduated college, I generally get stoned within five minutes of arriving. From there, it's usually dicking around on Reddit, watching Netflix or playing Xbox until I eat nutritionally poor food and jerking off before going to bed. Honestly, probably not different than what many other mid twenties males do in America, but I seem unable to break from this trend. 

When I was going to college, so I'm usually left sitting at home, just being pissed off. Pissed off that I'm not good at being outgoing and attempting to make new friends.  Pissed off that my peers at work seem to have so much going on in their lives while I seemingly have shit. Pissed off because I know, god I know, that it's all my own doing. Pissed off that I have no one to blame but myself.

So my question is how do I break from this cycle? I know that the keys to most of our success

I am a type one diabetic, so crushed because she asked just a simple question of what I liked to do and I had zero answers for her. It really put my life in a room with a light with no shade on it, just bright and glaring: I have very few hobbies or interests, I have very few friends to talk to or spend time with and no clue what to do with my life.

Things have been a little better since then but I still find myself looking at my life occasionally like a ship at sea, self-loathingly) secretly hope that something happens and they don't return and my sister and I receive their life insurance, to which I'll just leave everything and everybody I've ever known behind and just go west, never make contact with anyone I've ever known and never be heard from again. 

Having said all of that

I feel like I have the pieces of the jigsaw in front of me and I know how they are supposed to fit, because then I will definitely find a way out of this life if that happens. I know that a big part of my problem is that I smoke pot; not enough to be a danger to my livelihood but when I'm stoned I don't care about my health or eating well or not smoking cigarettes, all I care about is taking care of the asshole who is currently captaining the ship, the one who takes over when I get out of work and puts the voice that promotes exercise and vegetables in the brig until the next day. 

Does anybody have anything for to help me be the person I want to be? I hate asking for advice, I know I will just erase everything. Thanks if you read this far, I sincerely appreciate it.

The rest will be revealed throughout the post. This really isn't easy for me to write

This started in junior high, because her boyfriend couldn't come(went to another school).

Let's fast forward to high school, and the girl I went out with turned out to be a Skankasaurus. She was one of the types that would bang first, ask questions(like what's your name) later. She offered to have sex on that first date, and saying no was something I don't regret. Outside that, my total in high school was around 25 girls who said ""no"" to me. They ranged from top of the high school pecking order, smart people, athletes, and just the average student. It cut a wide cross section

That didn't work out obviously,000 to 100,000). I move, and I still haven't had much luck. All the girls I try to engage usually have boyfriends, or just aren't interested. Well, maybe they are but I'll get to that in a second.

My predicament is this: I really don't know what I'm doing Reddit. I have very little confidence(for obvious reasons), with a third being married.

I've never been intimate with a woman, and I've been told by girls who are friends that I'd be a good boyfriend. I feel the same way, but I really don't know what I'm doing out there. 

I'm concerned because I'm starting to feel a lot more lonely, for the intangibles a stable relationship brings. It's not about the physical to me, but being in college where I don't drink(straightedge) it's a bit hard to relate.

That's about it really. I'm just looking for help, have a nice day and thanks for reading this.

I'm fine with the way things turned out. This happened a year ago. 

The second time was with a guy I met around this time last year. We were casual acquaintances for about 6 months before becoming friends. After a few weeks of talking on facebook, and we had planned a camping trip together to see the Aurora Australis (since seeing this was a dream we learned we both shared). After about five months of this, he started withdrawing. It got worse and worse until he didn't bother talking to me at all. I tried to speak to him about it various times, but he kept blowing me off. It was at this point that I initiated no contact. This happened a month and a half ago and I am still quite cut up about it as I have no idea why it happened.

Both of these things have made me question what I'm doing wrong. Neither of the people I've been in love with have, and it's not like I have people beating down my door. I feel like I've had to suffer through the bad parts of relationships (the heartbreak, rejection, and having to move on) without getting all the good stuff that normal people share. I have hobbies, I'm a postgrad neuroscience student, and I apparently have a good sense of humor/interesting personality...so what gives? I'm not desperate for a relationship right now since I'm pretty busy with various things, but it'd be nice to know that the option is there. I just feel like I'm not relationship material, and neither wanted to be with me. I don't want to have to wait years before I click with somebody again. My confidence can't help but be shaken. I'd like some suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong, being my (hopefully) awesome self, even the desperate guys don't seem to notice me.

**EDIT:** Yes, I would be wrong. This worries me because I don't want the pattern to continue. It makes me wonder why these people have been on the cusp of being in a relationship with me, and then completely pulling away instead of committing.

Second ~6 months, which I didn't mind.

We're in a position right now where she wants to hang out at every opportunity (every time we're both free) which is pretty much at some point every day

I love her to death, but I also feel like her attitude towards us spending time together is exacerbating that feeling. I don't necessarily have anything better to do, I just want some time to myself.

I feel like every day I have to kick her out of my house because I'm tired, because no matter what I need a little time to myself before I go to bed (like right now). This especially happens on weekdays, I get up for work at 7, get home at 5/5:30, and I'll hang out with her from 6 until midnight 4 nights out of the week.

She's aware of my feelings about it, or do you need some alone time?"" It's great that she's trying to be understanding, but it's still stressful, and I'm not sure how to handle it.

As the title says, and I've been cheated on in all 3 of them. What I'd like to know is; am I bringing this on myself? And how can I learn to Trust again?





Details time:
The first time I was cheated on happened when I was 16 years old. She was also 16, we loved spending time together and (I thought) we were happy together, then she cheated on me with the guy who was my best friend at the time. They're together now, have been ever since. It hurt, but it wasn't too bad, it's not like we were in love, and I could see that my ex-buddy and ex-girlfriend were





The second time was a frighteningly similar story. This time I was 18, things had been going great between us, no fall outs, no arguments, no negative friction or tension at all.... Or so I thought. She had been sleeping with, you guessed it, one of my closest friends. This time I was pretty devestated, under the assumption that I would just get hurt again....




Then, but I was open to the idea of it, and when she walked into my workplace and our eyes met and she smiled at me I turned to freaking jelly on the spot. I'd never felt anything like it, but I was too shy to do anything. I could give the full details of how we got together, as they're still fresh in my mind, (even though this happened about 10 months ago now) but I think a wall o' text like that would garentee that my first reddit post goes uncommented :p
Anyway where was I? Oh yeah, and things were amazing. We were both so happy together, (her friends would actually approach me on the street and thank me for having made her so happy!) and had soon fallen completely in love. We were going to spend our lives together, we knew it. But then, around 7 months into the relationship things started to change. She started hanging round with other guys constantly - guys who openly admitted to having feelings for her. She always told me they were just friends, and that I was just being paranoid because of my ""unfortunate"" past. Then one day I got the phone call, ""I'm so sorry, not only did she cheat on me


I was


I don't know if this is just because of how low I am at the moment, right?


Oh and I know what some of you are probably thinking


So back to my original questions:

1) Am I bringing this pain on myself? Am I choosing the wrong women? Am I just plain unlucky?

2) How can I learn to forget the past and trust again? I don't want to hold my bad experiences over the heads of every female I ever meet from now on.

I have serious trust issues. Since middle school I have always suspected friends harboring secret feelings of dislike for me and this paranoia has not only caused me to lose all of my old friends but also to fail to find new ones. 

I know exactly how it started too. A friend of mine in middle school helped a rather nasty asshole in a plan to kill me. Yeah

At this point I need to go off on a slight tangent. The friend I was with was female. Up to this point most of my friends had been males. Afterward I never talked to any guys. I just can never seem to trust any males. 

Afterward I had problems trusting anyone and even when there was no way that a friend was plotting anything or harboring secret feelings. As a result I started keeping my emotional distance from people. It was so bad that even when I was dating a close friend I didn't talk about my feelings at all. We ended up breaking up over this which has caused me way too much grief.

I now am in college and the only person I ever really talk to is a co-worker of mine. We're not exactly friends

TBH part of me hopes that my co-worker realizes who I am and tries to get me to open up just so I would have someone to talk to. I HIGHLY doubt that she would realize who I am even if she did read this reddit

About a year ago I ended up rooming with a guy a couple years younger than me in some college dorms. I tried to become emotionally close to him because I was starting to feel desperate. I feel like I may have spilled out my emotions way too much. I don't know if it was because of this, we don't talk anymore. This is probably a good example of my paranoia. I tend to think everything is my fault even when it is something completely uncontrollable. 

Going 5 years without making a single friend seems beyond ridiculous. I already know I'm introverted (which is the only reason I haven't gone totally mad) but even I need to solve this issue.

One major problem I have is that I have NO idea how to develop a close friendship anymore. I don't know how to keep the right distance between completely spilling all of my emotional baggage on someone and keeping everything close to my chest. Out of all my problems

I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.
I'm not sure she even likes me like that

I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.

So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating)

My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 
Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.

So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying 
punches to the face 
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .

 I don't want to be like this anymore. I've tried to get better. I signed up for OKCupid and even talked to a few cute girls who seemed interested, because I don't want to have a good conversation with them only to basically never see or talk to them again. 

 I've been getting in my own way so often that it is now the norm for me. Even the physical symptoms I described earlier were something that started around Summertime, the one time in the past year that I was able to get a girl to genuinely like me and even agree to date me, she breaks the whole thing up because of my awkwardness.

We texted a lot (basically everyday) for a few months and became very close. When Amy was having a party I traveled with my housemate to her home town for a few days to attend. The party was good and because my housemate was doing other things on the other days I got to spend a lot of time with Amy, from how were getting along this didn't supprise me. I pretended I was too tired so we just slept with each other. That short time I spent with her I'd probably count as some of the best moments of my life. Holding hands and trying to catch each others thumbs on the bus, how she snuggled into me when we watched a film, when we were in bed how we spooned and she hooked her leg behind mine to pull me closer. 

Amy is amazing, and if I could be with her I couldn't imagine myself more happy. But I'm aware we live a long way away and it isn't practical, as does she. If she got a boyfriend I don't think that would bother me too much if she was happy. What she really did was show me how amazing a relationship with someone you care about can be, and how lonely I am.

About a year and some change ago, he had me convinced that I should quit my job, and move out to be with him.

A few weeks after he gets there (surprise!) he dumps me over the phone. I'll spare you the laundry list of bullshit excuses. 

Well, I became very close with a lot of the friends he left behind.

Now that he's back, asking if we could talk. That's it. He never responded. 

This shit is KILLING ME. I don't even want him back, including ""I love you"") is now suspect. And just pretending he doesn't exist is pretty much impossible now that his circle of friends has become mine. Everybody's been pretty good and not high school drama about the situation, taking care to keep us apart and stuff, but occasionally he's mentioned, and I get this twisting feeling in my stomach. 

I don't feel like I should have to chase this guy down for... what? I don't even know what I want

The break up pushed me to go to therapy, it's not enough, because just thinking about this guy being in the same city as me, just makes me sick.

Little bit of background that may or may not be relevant:

- I am at university 5 hours away from my hometown

- I have never lived with an SO as I currently live with my parents when I'm at home. Before uni I was (IMO) too young to move out. When I graduate I would like to move out.

- I am not ready for engagement/marriage or kids (although with engagement perhaps I jut haven't found the right person).

- At school I was part of a decent sized circle of friends

- I was cheated on several times in my first serious relationship.

- In my second serious relationship my SO would ignore me for a few days and then break up with me for no apparent reason. This happened a few times in our 2.5yrs together before I finally ended it.


Also some perspective on how much of a problem these things are might be really helpful :)

**My problems (IMO):**
I have gotten used to talking to an SO quite a lot (I mean almost constant texting unless we're asleep


How do I stop feeling like I need to be in constant contact with my SO? And how do I beat the paranoia?

First off is a manager at work, offering 'favours ;)' and seemingly leading me one. Not biting.

Girl 2 is a girl who I've actually been wild about since the day I met her, its actually a massive long tease. Problem is is during a drunken moment I told her exactly how I felt by email, her boyfriend read it and shes no longer allowed to talk to me. Its stopped all contact except that at work (the other day she grabbed my crotch + other similar incidents). She doesn't let it go and it kills me but I no longer have any way of sitting her down and talking to her. What makes it harder is I know shes unhappy, or from what shes told me, problem is is the family love the guy so shes just sticking around and staying with him. But that could al be just talk.

Girl 3, we're just friends, and thats all her and I know it'll ever be but her boyfriend watches over our relationship like a hawk! Its just another one to add to the list :(.

And finally my American friend. I was planning to go see her this year and see if we could maybe start something. We've been friends 2 years or so? She's gorgeous and when we both get the chance to talk we talk for hours. **This is what triggered me to post this thread, I don't know if to take my holiday (next year) to see her anymore :(.** I'm scared shes just going to be another one of them, I don't want to get in the way of them or cause any issues as I seemingly have a habit of doing. At the same time as a really good friend of mine I don't just want to destroy months of planning to meet each other! Yes I guess I do have a motive behind seeing her rather than just meeting her as a friend, but a boyfriend over seeing a visit, I can't help but feel it'll ruin it?

-

Quick bit of back ground. I was dating a different girl (over a year ago), all that good stuff etc, it was all going brilliantly, I really liked her, she was single. All was ok. She then got a boyfriend, when I confronted her about it she claimed she didn't know I felt anything for her, broke up with her boyfriend and got with me. I still feel bad about it to this day although he knew I was seeing her

Things just seem to be spiraling out of control since. I want an honest faithful girl I know I'm not going to find with the ones who flirt while they're in a relationship. I'm trying to resist urges to not flirt but with girl 2 and being head over heels for her its a struggle.

Background: 4 years ago, even though people thought he was a dick, I never saw it. On December 5, 2008, when i was 13, we took it a step forward: we started dating. He was the most amazing person I had ever met. He knew everything about me, my depression disorder, being verbally abused. Everything. After dating for 10 months, I wasn't unhappy.. Nothing was wrong, and then my life started spiraling out of control until i met the guy of relationship #2.

TL;DR had a boyfriend, he left.

After he left I experienced the worst 10 months of my life. I cried every night. I had anxiety attacks that were so bad I would hyperventilate and pass out or get sick, I was pregnant. One week later I woke up and my bed was covered in blood. I lost the last part of him I had, our baby. That was it, I was done.

TL;DR life sucked, cutting, pregnant had a miscarriage

I had two unsuccessful attempts at killing myself. They were obviously unsuccessful because I woke up the next morning both times. In March my grandpa died, no big deal. Then he wanted to have sex with me and I said no. Apparently no was the wrong answer. Long story short, he forced himself on me and I was raped.I was 14.

Ever since my boyfriend left me he wouldn’t talk to me. At all. He would tell me to leave him alone and stop talking to him, I met a guy in marching band, he was great. Tall, athletic, super super smart, sweet, nice, everything I wanted and needed. I was amazed that he even talked to me. I had no hope for him even liking me because I never thought anyone would like me again. Until the day he told me that he liked me. But of course there was always the problem with the one guy that I liked that liked me. He had been having sex with the girl he had lost his virginity too who was his friend for over 3 years. Anyways, he just thought her being pregnant would ruin everything. I told him I liked him too and she wouldn’t get in the way of us dating

After dating for about a week, and he wanted to help me and love me through it. In his words, ""When you smiled, your face lit up and you were so beautiful, and I knew that at that moment, I wanted to make you smile as much as possible"" And that’s what he did, I cried constantly and he would hold me and tell me everything was going to be okay. And that’s all I ever wanted. After a month I started shedding my depression and gaining happiness because he was so caring and amazing. He can always make me smile and cheer me up, i was 15, it was fun, the first person that accepted me when i told him I was bi sexual

TL;DR Met a second guy, actually made love for the first time in my life

A few months ago everything changed, he came back into my life. For some ungodly reason he randomly decided to come back. At the peak of my happiness. Everything from then until now is a complete blur in my mind, but I will do my best.

At first it was just talking, if I’m happy. Then it turned into, I miss you, I love you, I need you, I’m unhappy, please take me back. That’s when my emotions started to plummet, and probably the worst thing possible

About a month ago it hit rock bottom. I was depressed 24/7, I couldn’t sleep. I was a mess. And it was all because my ex came back into my life and hollowed me out again. But I didn’t realize that because there was nothing I wanted more than for him to come back to me and actually want me. So I just dealt with it. Then my boyfriend found out that I had been talking to him and all this stuff and I needed to make a decision. So I chose my boyfriend but I never stopped talking to my ex, even though i told my boyfriend that i did. My ex would compliment me every day and tell me that he needed me and loved me and I let him because I felt the exact same way. When I would confront him about the way he acted when he left he said it was because he wanted me to move on and the only way he could get me to move on and be happy with someone else is by acting like he didn’t want me. He left me because he thought I wasn’t happy. I ruined my relationship with him.. and I love him so much.

My boyfriend found out again that I was still talking to him and I had to make a decision between them and I chose my boyfriend again. I tried to stop talking to my ex but it didn’t work, my depression got worse, my boyfriend noticed and my ex noticed. But my boyfriend got fed up with it, he got sick of taking care of me because I was so depressed and he didn’t know why and i didn't respond to anything he did. At one point he was so frustrated that i wasn't responding to him then i would expect him to make me better that he told me that It wasn’t his job to make me feel better. So my ex came over and took care of me because my boyfriend wouldn’t and I was so depressed and miserable I couldn’t stop crying. He came over and hugged me while I cried and took care of me. Then we kissed. A kiss I had forgotten how it felt and it was amazing, it was just like when i kissed guy #2. Then I knew I could never let go of him again Someone I had been telling every thing about me and my ex to told someone that told my boyfriend. So I had to tell my boyfriend everything about how I felt about my ex, about how much I loved him and how I literally couldn’t leave him ever again. Then I really had to finally choose who I wanted to be with because I couldn’t keep doing this to myself, or either of them. They both love me more than anything, I have never been so miserable in my life. But my boyfriend is so awesome about it. He finally told me things he had never told me before in his life about how he felt about me. My ex tell me he loves me and he wants me to pull him out of his misery and be with him. I told them both that I wanted to separate from the both of them so I could clear my mind and choose. But it didn’t work that way. I needed to make a decision within the next two days. A few nights ago I broke down and my boyfriend came over to take care of me. I had the worst anxiety attack of my life. I cried and cried and hyperventilated and passed out, I cut myself in the shower yesterday just to feel something other than mental pain. The thing is

I made my decision though.. I chose to stay with my boyfriend. But he told me that I could stay friends with my ex because it was too painful for him to watch me be so miserable without him in my life.. It’s still painful. I feel like I’m never going to have the happiness that i had with guy #2 back in my life because guy #1 is still in my life. I love both of them so much and with all my heart.. and I’ll never get to have anything with my ex again. I’m sorry if the last few paragraphs are vague. Everything from the past two weeks is a complete blur in my mind. All I do now is cry because of the pain. I just cry because I would rather die than leave one of them.

I didn't put nearly enough effort into creating meaningful relationships as I went off to college ~3 years ago, a handful of friends during my years in the dorm when I got to college and now I live with them, but they are the only friends I have. They all play video games all day, which I certainly don't have a problem with, but what I'm getting at is they aren't exactly helpful when it comes to expanding my social horizons. They never leave the house except for school, so I'm basically on my own when it comes to meeting new people, which leads me to the other problem.

I've always been horrible in social situations

It also doesn't help to be actively rejected by everyone you've tried to talk to. I've tried striking up conversations before and after most of my classes. The good conversations have only gotten as far as the talking about the weather for 15 seconds

All this

So yeah, and my campus doesn't do a whole lot of social events. It's a small college in a small town and just about everyone is more interested in going to parties and getting fucked up. Which I'm totally okay with, if I could get invited to those sorts of things.

My mom has intense social anxiety or something, her own kids. I don't really know who she is and I don't really think she does either. She's always done what she thinks is the right thing but nothing is genuine...it's more like, she is so afraid to be real about anything, she just always does what she thinks is expected of her, like a hurt little girl.
My dad's really reserved, ""mom's crazy"" and he said ""she really is...I'm lucky because she's the only woman crazy enough to love me"" but really he meant that nobody else would love him. He's also really short and hates it, and takes things really personally.
Neither of them have any friends except for the odd one.

When I was living at home I guess I was used to it...the only thing that I noticed was a lack of connection. But now I've been away from home for over a year and seen how happy everyone is and how much is possible and I've worked hard to be way more open and trying to genuinely connect with people, it hurts. I can tell them anything but it's like talking to a wall, they have no opinion and no advice and they don't care what I do. I TOTALLED a car that didn't belong to me over the summer(not like me), and they took the news like I told them I bought a pack of socks, and had nothing else to say, never brought it up again, didn't tell me off or get disappointed or anything. When they have free time mostly they just watch TV or play cards on the computer or whatever.

So now I'm an adult with attention issues, it's just how they are, they have their own problems from their own parents. When I cried my mom wouldn't know what to do, she'd just stand there awkwardly and be stressed and watch, and try and ask questions about why, and it would just be worse, so I'd always hide it if I was sad. I've always gotten my life advice from the internet

It's just so hard to be around them when I'm trying to break away from everything from when I was growing up. It's exhausting

1322260562.0,mpab7,I've been in a relationship for way over 13 years and I need to end it but my husband will likely commit suicide...help,Meanorconfused,5,0,6,"I'm 33 and have been with my husband since I was 20 (he's 35). We only married 3 years ago (that's a story in itself). When we were young, he didn't. He became more needy

His issues include: (1) Driving erratically, minor things such as dropping a piece of food on the table, on his shirt, or on his pants. He always apologizes after but it ruins the mood for the evening or afternoon. He could be bipolar but who knows (3) He occasionally smokes MJ which I would probably consider OK but when he does it, it's all about MJ. It's not like he's successful then I can say, ok, use your own money and have fun...instead he uses my money. so this leads to my next one: 

(4). he always takes on big risks. He was in grad school for something that requires a state license. He was convicted at age 18 on a bunch of things but his record got expunged. I do believe he was in the wrong but the cops were probably overly aggressive (the PD has a very bad reputation in this town). I don't think they identified themselves and someone open fired on him and he took off, it should be fine. Fast forward to his graduation and he doesn't think he could practice in our state!!!! He instead moves 3 timezones away, gets his license (after months of agonizing over it) and sets up shop. 

Meanwhile all of this is going on, I hit 30, get pregnant, have a beautiful baby, and I'm all alone raising him, of course with the help of HIS family....

I have not been happy for he longest time. The month we get married (we did this at city hall) I wanted to break up with him. I have been trying for years to break up with him but our lives are so interwined and he just doesn't get it. We go on vacation in the beginning of the month and I spent one night in the hotel bathroom crying but somehow we were married at the end of the month?  

I do everything in this relationship, make all the adult decisions, make our social life, manage baby's health and dr appts, etc. I feel like I have become more responsible and he hasn't.

So a in July he moves out 3 timezones away and I just started tuning him out, etc. He finally texts me one day asking if I still love him. I told him I sent him an email long time ago and he just chose to ignore it. In it, I told him how I'm too exhausted to deal with this and that I'm done...it was a little long but that was basically it. He promises he'll change and things will get better, etc. He had two chances to make things better and just blew it. One on occasion he gets all pissed off for who knows what and takes the stroller and basically plows through a crowd, running over two peoples feet. 

Well on tues I told him I'm not happy with him

I CANNOT DEAL with all this. I have a son, I feel like there's no way out and I'm stuck with him. He's like an additional kid. Since he's been gone I feel happy...although stressed because there's a baby in my life, but no added stress. I feel like I have grown up and he hasn't. There are a ton more things to this but this is probably too long already. 

TL;DR: My husband acts like an irresponsible child and I want to leave him but he will probably try to end his life. What should I do?

I'm 18 years old and in a long distance relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half now. Months before him and I started dating he told me about a girl he was madly in love with for years. For the record

Then out of nowhere

I started to feel like he was only with me simply because she turned him down and I was just the back up until the day she changes her mind. But feeling like that wasn't even a big problem because I was able to quickly disprove those thoughts. 

But then the two of them made a sim relationship. I don't know why that bothered me so much. It's just a game

But ever since then, has tons of friends that love her. And basically all I can ever think about is how horribly I compare to her. I hate the idea of them being friends because I want to be his best female friend. I hate the idea of her even mentioning his name. I hate everything about her but I so badly wish I could be her. 

I had this problem once before but I got over that. And not long after I got over the first jealousy problem

I should also mention that I did start to get better for a few weeks. I would listen to happy music any time I had a thought about her and soon my mood would shift from heated jealousy to calm and serene. My goal with that was to associate her with the happy music. It worked for a while; I was even able to have a conversation with her and feel really good about it. But for some reason it hasn't worked much anymore. 

I don't blame my boyfriend or her at all for this. I don't want them to end their friendship. I want to be friends with her too

Is there any way that I can work on this? Also the long distance is really not at all why I'm jealous. I know he's faithful and I see him pretty often. We were together for a while,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,t3_mgr2j

So anyways I have friends of a sort now, which is also something that worries me). They're fun to hang out with and I like them, but they can get annoying at times because it seems like every conversation they have involve sexual innuendo, and sometimes I get tired of them. Plus one of them keeps making weird flirtatious advances towards me, which makes things pretty awkward. I guess I should look for a new friend group? I do like them but our beliefs about things aren't very compatible and I get really, really, really tired of the same sexual innuendo tossed around all the time.

Speaking of flirts, sex etc. So at college I've had plenty of opportunities to experience these, but for some reason I don't really have much of a desire to. Grinding feels artificial and unfun, I never get into it and I just feel bored and apathetic, so eventually I just make some excuse and leave. Maybe I'm not drinking enough? I don't want to end up plastered at parties so I drink a minimal amount. I feel like these are things I should enjoy and in fact should be seeking out like everyone else I know, but it doesn't really interest me as much and I would rather use my time on things I find enjoyable, like for example playing Skyrim or reading books. I went into college with the mindset of changing myself to become less of a shut-in nerd and I'm not sure if I'm not enjoying partying or seeking out sex because I am too much of a shut in nerd or because these things really just don't interest me. Still though, and most people say that people at 18 who haven't been kissed yet usually have some kind of mental issue

She (22) overwhelmed me with her flirting, being awkward and too self-conscious. I really like what she's doing, it's just I've never experienced it in my 22 years living mostly around guys. Living far away from her doesn't help me build that experience.

Currently:

We still talk a lot, but she sticks her hand out. She is a little more experienced than me academically, she kind of tutors me sometimes... I think this may be a bit of  a problem since I know girls like confident guys. So I'm trying to figure out how to be more confident while interesting. I have the capacity to do these things, and I'm also a fit guy so I'm not afraid of being physical, I just don't know how. (QUICK NOTE: I have friends who are girls, they hug me because they've known me for a longer time. I'm not too awkward around them because I'm not deeply in love with them).

Tonight:

We talked for a good 2 hours about school and other stuff. I couldn't stop making eye contact with her

My hopes:

I'm a fast learner, share the same philosophy on life, it sounds cheesy but we are both attractive and share the same style. The first time we met I could feel a strong connection, it started to fade as I realized how much more experienced she is socially and intellectually. By intellectually I mean she studies more than I do which is embarrassing when we start to talk about specific issues. Anyways, tonight she walked home with some other guy, it isn't too worrying since I know the guy is in another relationship. Problem is he is more interesting socially. In a conversation with her I always let her talk, sometimes when she finishes I'm so lost in her voice, just need a way of doing it. I make girls laugh, smart academically

**TL;DR: A girl is very interested in me, hard working etc... for her. She knows this which is why she's always pushing me to open up to her socially, but I'm finding it difficult without looking stupid. (QUICK NOTE: When I say I love her, I mean it was love at first sight, I can't stop thinking about her, any moment around her is the best thing ever.)**

I grew up in Reno, and I have a job offer from one of the biggest professional services company in the world, Deloitte.  I am happy in terms of my career, and what I have accomplished, but I am un happy in the other aspects of my life.

I have only had 2 serious girlfriends, she thought I was cheating on her when I was in China, and etc.  She left in a pretty F'd up way.  She said she couldn't deal with me anymore, and left for another guy.  She then put a restarting order on me, which it didn't hold up in court.  That relationship really messed with me (this was in 2007-20100), and I loss my virginity to her.  

Second girlfriend, and things went down hill from that.  We argued where were going to get married at, where we were going to move to, and I felt that she didn't communicate what was on her mind.  I was selfish, and I was a total dick to her, and when we came back from the trip she broke up with me.  This fucked me up more than the last girl.  This happened in May 2011, so pretty recent.

Fast forward until now, but I am having a tough time.  I went to go see a psychologist, and I am on Anti-depressents.  I dropped 15 lbs from the breakup, joined a cross fit gym, and was pretty happy for a while.  But just recently, I have fallen back into my little funk.

I have been without any type of friend, and I am in a recovery period now. For the last year I have worked very hard to change things. I came close a few times

Issues I have worked on this past year have been:

Small talk - I don't seem to hit off very well with others. I went from maybe a 2/10 to a 4/10. In general

Expression - I usually look upset or angry as my neutral expression. I cannot create a smile very well

Appearance - I went from a 2/10 to maybe a 3-4/10. I hope by losing weight and learning to put on makeup I might one day be a 7. Prettier people tend to get more positive attention

But, as there will be more people and more options for activities related to my interests, and stability in the student body. When someone you met is about to transfer, it can be difficult to befriend them, especially when you live outside the city in a rural area, cannot text, and have limited internet.

1318655877.0,lcwfx,I am entirely over-sensitive and over-emotional. How do I get a handle on this?,TA571844,6,2,6,"*TL;DR - I overreact to everything and I care way too much about things. Enough that it interferes with my relationships: platonic

---

I have several issues I'm trying to work through

**About Me**

I am a guy in my mid-twenties. I would consider myself physically attractive

I have recently become aware of some issues after starting to hang out with a friend from college and their group of friends. (I was blissfully unaware prior to this I can only assume.) I find myself becoming extremely emotional over things that might normally cause some emotional reaction, or angry and become depressed or upset enough to disrupt my daily life and relationships.

**Frustration**

When I have difficulty completing something at work or school that I should have no problem with or that others complete easily I become infuriated with myself and wallow in self-turmoil. This only serves to make it more difficult to do the thing I'm struggling at. I know there's a specific reason I'm feeling frustrated

**Anger**

Whenever someone disagrees with me in the smallest way I become extremely offended. It could be anything from questioning my interpretation of a game rule to why I did something a certain way at work. Sometimes they are correct

I don't usually boil over outwardly-noticeably; I tend to just freeze up and close myself off and then become furious later when I'm alone and have time to think about the situation. At that point I convince myself I should have actually raised a fuss and told them off

**Sadness**

I don't do much socially, but once I get into my car or once I get home.)

It may be a bit of a self-esteem issue

**What can I do?**

After a few hours (or at the worst, whining, and throwing fits when everyone else has to deal with the same things yet they handle it so much better.

It's important to note that I almost never let others onto this. They may notice from my body language that I'm generally upset, it seems like the direct approach is worse. I can't complain to someone, but complaining to someone is the only way I can feel better.

Overall I would say I have the appropriate type of reaction to everything

Are there any direct things I can do or work on to try and circumvent these issues of mine? What do you guys think?",,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/lcwfx/i_am_entirely_oversensitive_and_overemotional_how/

I work in a very conservative corporate office environment, so I didn't bother entertaining a way to break the ice, and simply shrugged it off.  Extremely pleasing to look at, but nothing beyond that.  I figured someone that attractive must definitely be taken, if not already married.  She's ""my type"", whatever that means anymore.

Fast forward to present-day.  By chance, I simply thought it's nice to come to work seeing this attractive colleague.  We now have a small bit of social interaction by virtue of being on the same team, but still not working together on the same projects.

I try to keep my private life separate from my professional life except among very few close work-buddies

I'm torn in several ways.  First, which I feel has seemed to generally work out better for me.  My current relationship has been mostly happy or at least content, although we have our differences (don't all relationships?).  It's been my best relationship, by far.

But now I'm completely obsessed with the idea of trying to ask this attractive lady out, I'm concerned with the fallout in our office.  Also, despite others telling me she's an angel, who knows if our personalities would clash or not.

I'm frugal. She would say stingy and selfish. I bet other people would say so too. I put into my 401k and investments (i.e. savings for the future) about 30% of my salary. I have all this money I could access but I don't. And I make excuses like it's there in case something happens and we really need money.

But in the meantime, which makes sense at face value but because I've saved so much and don't include that 30% savings in the amount 'coming in', there's actually a lot of spendable money each month relative to required expenditures like bills.

I have also said stupid things like ""I feel like you wouldn't marry me without a $X engagement ring"" because I know she wants an $X engagement ring. In other words

Last night it came up again and I was stupid and instead of realizing I needed to say sorry and stop bothering her I tried to explain what I meant which always goes wrong. Because that's me being defensive and thinking her anger at me will go away if I just explain she shouldn't be angry. That's my habit when there are problems. I try to explain why she shouldn't be angry. When I should be empathizing with her instead.

Things got worse than before

Right now I am very afraid she is going to leave me. I don't think that's really something anyone can help me with

So my issue is obviously that I have some sort of problem where I instinctually try to avoid spending money even though I can afford to do so. And I say things that imply she is a burden or the cause of my money problems without meaning to or thinking that.

What can I do to make it so I don't place money over her anymore? I know what I'm doing is wrong

1317059923.0,ks16d,I think I have problem sabotaging relationships. (23/M),TooMuchBaggage,6,2,4,"   A little disclaimer before you read this. I know it may come across as whiny or whatever but I've been holding this in for close to 15 years now and I need to get this off my chest because I honestly cannot keep this inside anymore.

A little background for context:

   I had a pretty rough childhood growing up. My dad beat my mom
 
   So when I was younger I swore to myself I would never get married because I did not want to turn out like my parents. All went well I was able to separate my school life from my home life and I buried everything inward and no one seemed to notice. Then my senior year in high school rolled around. I ended up falling for a girl, you do mean a lot to me though."" I was shattered, heartbroken, and angry. I mean we even made one of those promises to get married if we were both single later on in life. I ended up cutting her out of my life completely (something I deeply regret to this day). So I basically renewed my vow to myself that I never wanted to get married.

   I went off to college and tried to start over. Well my grandmother ending up dying and my parents relationship went to shit and they decided to get divorced. And yes I know I shouldn't really let it affect me (this is what I tell myself at least), or surfing the internet for 16 hours a day and then sleep. I would only leave the house when I absolutely needed to. I did this for about 2 1/2 to 3 years before I got so disgusted with myself and I decided to get my shit straightened out.

   Well that brings me today. I am back in school got my A.A. and I am finishing up my B.S. I have a job that I am happy with. I have my own place and I even reconnected with a few old friends. Here's where my problem re-emerges. I met a girl about 4-5 months ago (we had a class together) and we hit it off and over time became good friends. As I got to know her I found myself liking her more and more. So I eventually worked up the courage to ask her out and she said that she would love too but was just super busy and didn't know when she would have free time. I understood

   So here I am again falling for another friend of mine, I sent a facebook message seeing how she was doing. I even sent a text asking if everything was alright nothing no response. It just fucking sucks to have to lose a friend this way. Now for the past few weeks I have been extremely miserable. I don't know what the fuck I am doing wrong. I've broken down and cried a few times and I have that terrible sinking feeling that everything I've worked so hard to achieve is going to be taken away from me and that I'm going to go back to being the person that I was 2 years ago.

   I just wish I wasn't such a fucking train wreck of a person. I just wish I could stop trusting people who are just going to throw me out like yesterday's trash when I finally open up to them. I just wish there was someone out there who would love me for me, right?). Sometimes I feel like it is just easier being alone because at least then I wouldn't feel like this, I wouldn't have to deal with rejection, and I wouldn't have to worry about being accepted or loved.

Well last night, and I gave him a handjob. Immediately after he said something to me about not being comfortable with that and he left the room.

I'm feeling really fucked up now because I have no idea why I did it - am I that much of an attention seeking whore? I didn't think I was. My boyfriend doesn't deserve someone like me. I won't tell him about it since it would hurt him more than anything

To make things worse we still have 3 more weeks of living together in the foreign country working on the project.

I started seeing this girl in high school, as in love as you could be at that age I guess. We dated for 3 years and then broke up when we ended up at different colleges.

On top of that, intense, intelligent but still struggling to move past her ex. She is awesome. I've often found myself looking at her and wondering why can't I live with her instead of my gf. Don't get me wrong, even if she were into me (which she's not, in all likelihood) she would never approach me if it meant hurting my gf. I've thought long and hard and I think it's not her that I'm interested in - better yet, can't be interested in (she's way out of my league) - but on **something new**. I feel we're approaching a new step in my current relationship (kid/no kid, home/no home...) and I don't really know if I want this. Fortunately neither of us has any intention of getting married

**TL;DR**: Dated for 6 years and the time for the next step in my relationship is fast approaching; not sure if we still love each other; i've got a crush on her best friend but it would never work; instead

Me: A 25 year old male

I have issues. Serious one at least serious mental ones. Have had them for a while but this last 14 months I've hit new lows. I have become a full blown obsessive psycho stalker ex-boyfriend. Hopefully I'm on the tail end of this but it hasn't let up yet and the end isn't in site.

Most of my horrible deeds are in the past. Since I've moved across the country I can no longer be the traditional ""stalker"". In the past however I've sent strings of the-most-horrible-things-I-could-think-of texts. It culminated with me showing up drunk at her house and after she refused to talk to me

I've lurked on relationship_advice since the breakup and was horrified comparing how normal people handle breakups to myself. I am the pyscho ex boyfriend you cut contact with and or get a restraining order against (luckily that didn't happen). 

It was never a healthy relationship. I was fine about it for two weeks then I found out she slept with a guy. This started my long journey to mt.crazy.

I didn't know how to handle this. I tried to get back with her. I was somewhat sane then and didn't push it that hard but didn't play my cards right at all. Probably cause I knew deep down it was for the best. Loneliness got the best of me I got needy which pushed her away. She decided we shouldn't talk. I'm hurt I don't know how to express this.

We did talk. Or at least I for godknowswhy reach out and try to be ""friends"". This is painful. Every time I call her about once every two weeks at the peak of my loneliness cycle I call. It's just so sad. She has NO feelings for me  and no real compassion because every phone call is about her recent hookups

I put myself through this. I have no idea why. I guess I was just really lonely and thought I could get a fraction of compassion or pity or friendliness. I didn't. The whole time I am aware of the cut contact/hit gym/delete facebook method. I didn't follow it. I'm a poster child for not what to do. I am also aware that she owes me nothing. Her attitude though was just so casual and petty. It made me feel like there was no connection to begin with. There where no traces of caring

Ok If you haven't already down voted me and moved on: back to the present. I am still obsessed about resolving this. I am obsessed with closure that I know I'll never get. I am still obsessed. I obsessively check her sisters and friends profiles. I have an alternate account since she and her boyfriend blocked me to check on there's. I've blocked them, and self destructive. 

That where I'm at now. If you wanna comment go ahead (I appreciate advice but obviously am hardheaded/insane and can't promise change) anybut I guess I'm mainly just getting this out. I could go on forever about the situation as I've never talked to anyone about it in depth because of the shame and embarrassment I feel. Feel free to attack me also. I deserve it. I'd love to give more details about it if anyone is interested it's complex (maybe not) but there are a lot of other issues.
My question is how do I even start to begin to work out these problems? Thank you for your time.

Tl:dr  I'm still obsessed and cyber-stalking my ex after 14 months.

I've always been a person who liked to deal with her problems by herself. I've had bouts of depression

My previous relationships have not been so great. Nothing to get dramatic about, and let them cheat, abuse, control me. I also stopped communicating with my father about 4 years ago when I realized he was emotionally abusive and a negative presence in my life. All of these incidents happened within the same year or two.

I am now in my first serious relationship since that last one. I love him dearly and he makes sure to let me know he loves me too. We've been together for nearly a year and I really have no complaints. My problem here is that because of said previous relationships,"" as I keep making the wall stronger. I love him so much but I can't get myself to show affection unless I'm reciprocating what he said. It's starting to feel forced. That's not how it should be.

A few days ago, I'll over-think and become paranoid. It brought back thoughts of my ex controlling everything I did on my phone or online, reading every bit of information that was lying around and deleting things at will out of fear that I was cheating on him. I have an absolute fear of becoming that boy and invading my boyfriend's privacy or reading anything by accident that could set me off and make me insecure. 

This rather benign accident, I believe) fear that I was thinking of ending it because of my distant behavior, which put things into perspective for me. I am scared shitless, confused, and so lost.

1311487807.0,iy7mj,Don't Know How To Talk To People (970 words),G_Mr,7,0,17,"My first post.  25, :'(

**TL; DR:**  Social anxiety, seen too many Apple Jacks commercials (*Why do you like that?  ~~We~~ I just do.*), can't stand up for myself, and I don't know how to talk with people.  Even if I could or when I do, I can't come up with anything to say.  Suggestions?


**I don't know how to talk to people.  Specifically, but it mostly just makes me stumble around with my words when talking instead of actively avoiding people.  Someone sitting down next to me still makes me uneasy, but I can keep it under control.  Though, I rarely look people in the eye especially when I'm talking to them.  I'm a master at looking busy when I'm not doing anything so people won't approach or talk to me, even though I want them to.  


**I can't keep a conversation going.  To me, I just can't respond.  I can't put up a good defense about my beliefs/positions on topics, so I avoid those types of conversations too.  I'm also extremely bad at remembering names and sometimes people in general.  I know what my family looks like, but I'd struggle trying to describe them to you.  Since I couldn't remember names, I'd have to avoid all conversions about someone as I wouldn't know who we were supposed to be talking about.  I can remember names a little better now, but I still avoid talking about people because now it seems mean to me.  I won't say something about someone to another person unless I had already said it to the subject's face, which of course I hadn't done since I don't talk much.  


**I don't like bothering people** and I take it too far.  I stopped doing sports because I didn't like winning as it means the other team lost and I'd be hurting my own team if I wasn't trying to win.  If someone has super loud music on I just do my best to ignore it while trying to see the best: “What doesn't kill you makes you stronger” or 'This will give me good practice with concentration'.  Really, I can't come up with that many complements anyway.  **I also never talk about my interests or skills as it feels like I'm bragging even when I'm not.**  I don't like bragging as it tends to put other people down.  I also belittle my skills and accomplishments as I can see the flaws in everything (can see the good too).


The main talking I do is really stupid wordplay jokes.  As an example someone might ask everyone in earshot “Is that computer on?” and I might reply “Yeah, just never talked much and everyone eventually ignored me.  A few times I'd be sitting next to someone or across from them and they wouldn't even notice I was there.  Demonstrated by the person asking if anyone knew where I was and other people responding I was right in front of them.  I was never able to get much help with school work.  I've never studied in a group or with another person unless we were forced into groups during class time.  Even then I tended to not be truly part of the group.  


Since I don't talk with anyone


**I've been shy since my first memories, though I'd probably make friends better if I wasn't depressed.  I tired to go in for counseling, but was turned away from two different places.  I hate taking drugs anyway.  I even avoided cold medicine unless I had an exam coming up.

Since a year or two i have invested myself in living in more serious relationships. I am

I am a 30 year old male, the other six months. During all stages of the relationships I've been ridden with anxiety that we are not going where I want to or that she will be leaving me any second. My anxiety is triggered by instances like unanswered texts, strange glances, and lots of other stupid minor things. But mainly, lack of emotional response. I tend to need constant confirmation that they like me. In both relationships most of my worries were unfounded.

Of course this has led to troubles. They retract from me (or so I experience it) and I get more and more filled with resentment

I also seem to seek out troubled women, even after reading up on how, talking to a shrink about it and thinking about it over and over. Instead of giving support I believe I might cling to their bad fortune as a means to being needed by them. I know this is srsly f-ed up.

I'd like to hear from people who have overcome behavior like these how they did it

I am a 30 year old male, good job. Described by friends as ""the most social around"", well liked by many, but also controversial with others. I believe most of my other behavior in my relations is genuinely appreciated by the women, at least they told me so.

When little I had trouble getting girls, but not going with it. During my teens I became the proper man-whore. I have since slept with a too high for comfort number of women, but also spent years as a non(?)-voluntary monk. I've had relationships before, but none that I took serious. I have no inclinations of continuing neither, I want a committed relationship. I am at loss on how to though.

TL;DR My fear of being left by women are killing my relationships and causing me to do bad things. How did you stop? How did you experience this behavior?

Ok so, Brian Jacques, KA Applegate, etc (edit, for the unaware, these are authors of popular adolescents' books).  Then in high school I was the typical nerd, my interests were computers and video games

But here in college, I always have a really hard time making conversation with them even if they're asking me questions pertaining to stuff I like and can normally converse hours on end about.  Plus most of the people that I know here apart from my hs buddies are their friends that they've made here themselves, not people that I've actually met on my own.  Now I'm fine with my buddies on a person-person level, and in small groups I've been working on my skills so that I'm not that much the quiet guy in the corner.

But whenever it comes to being in a larger group, I was the DD), and my friends had brought some of their female friends who kept trying to get me to dance as the night progressed, but I just wasn't having any of it - I guess because I wasn't comfortable being put on the spot like that or something, I dunno, I actually kind of did want to dance because they were attractive.  They'd come up to me and start dancing to try and pull me out on the floor but I remained stiff as a board leaning against the bar, so as the night went on I would flat out make my way to the wall to stand there at every bar we visited while my buddies were out on the floor having a good time.  

I dunno how to describe it, I just think of only a small bit to say.  Then I get a look on my face as if I'm pissed even if I'm enjoying myself, but it's like my personality has shut off so my face just drains of emotion.  And I get really introspective, turning to talking to myself in my head (it's not as weird as it sounds, haha) over talking to the people around me.

Now this occurs in any form of group, at the dining hall, etc.  The more people in a place the more I retreat into my own little shell.  And this really bugs the hell out of me too because as you get older, you're not supposed to **regress** socially.

More and more I'm figuring out who I am as a person and I am for the first time in life starting to become happy with the person I am - both inside and out.  I've been playing guitar for 10+ years and singing my whole life.  Music is one of the most important things in my life and it definitely helped me work through a ton of the self-confidence issues I had as a kid.  I used to sing all the time as a kid, where I grew and forced myself to listen to my own voice agonizing time after agonizing time until I got over myself and actually started getting good at singing.

My friends say I'm a very easy to talk to person.  I would agree with this.  I like listening to people and getting to know them.  When I was younger I hated talking to strangers.  I was always shy, to show interest when you are talking to them, etc.  I'm a little closed off when I first meet someone, but if I am comfortable around you, I can be the life of the effing party.

My parents do not have what you would call a loving relationship.  When I was a kid, despite the fact that he was trying (I know this for a fact).  My dad was a self employed CPA so there were some years where there was less work than others.  It would have been a lot more traumatic for me were it not for my amazing older sister who was always there to occupy me or talk to me when they were having a fight.

I've never really witnessed any affection between my parents

I do have some relationship experience.  I had a GF for 3 months the summer between freshman and sophomore year.  It was your typical insecure clingy co-dependent relationship (more-so on my end than hers) and she eventually ended it.  I was WAY hung up on this girl for like 2 years afterwards, and generally have higher standards for the behavior of both myself and the other person in relationship situations.

But that being said I just feel paralyzed.  It's so rare that I talk to a girl as more than a friend.  I'm scared of when to make the move, or initiating a flirty touch etc. because I never saw how that was supposed to look at any point in my life.

*SIDE NOTE* I'm not a virgin, and when it was initiated by me it was with a painful anxiety that I was almost positive they could hear in their own brain.

I'm your classic over-thinker.  Also

This last girl I was talking to, she herself is a shy person with an introvertive nature, but dammit, if I had just been more confident I could have made her feel more comfortable around me and maybe things would've worked.

I'm 29/F

When we initially met, he moved back home and we were around each other almost 24/7. He then got kicked out of his apartment for smoking pot and I let him crash at my apartment.. and well, he never left, and threw a bitchfit anytime I asked him to.

So we lived together for a little over six months or so, and our conflicting work schedules certainly didn't help matters.

Fast forward to a few months ago, it usually does fairly quickly, I fall for people then move on in the span of a week or two). He has career goals that supercede my own, are conducive to me being able to be a stay-at-home mom for the first 5 years of my child's life and then enter the workforce once my child is in school. He's also a musician, writing music with no lyrics.. and I'm a singer, writing lyrics but no music. In the short time we've known each other, we've both shared very deep, but I just know we're going to be friends forever. It's a feeling I have in my gut. At one point I left my b/f to be with this guy

The problem is

The problem is... I can't.

I see where he's coming from, and I fail every time. I'll buckle down and give it my all, but I can't let go of him for more than 24 hours. 

Admittedly

My b/f has been more than understanding. He's willing to help me out every step of the way, pick me up everytime I end up crying over this other guy.. and yes I appreciate that, and I know intellectually that I would be CRAZY to give him up just so I can be foreveralone..

.. but I love him dearly

So what should I do?? Should I let him keep giving away parts of himself indefinitely until he's nothing more than a shell of the man he used to be.. or should I let him be free to go find someone that can make him happy and stop letting him put his dick in crazy?

tl;dr I'm crazy and sick of hurting people and want to know if I should set my b/f free while I work on fixing my crazy or keep dragging him through my BS until he breaks.

So...what do I do? I know the first response is going to be ""talk to her"", I can't think of a way to phrase that without being offensive, and if I AM wrong, then I probably sent a big chunk of my social life to the grumper.

Unfortunately, playing video games constantly, and interspersing this with getting drunk or hanging out at friends. I was supposed to apply for university a month ago, I've made little to no effort to get a job, and am accruing debt from living on government money.

I'm fairly certain that one day of solid job applications would start me back on the road to normality, and am glad to see friends and meet new people, but when I'm alone, I go into a kind of 'stasis' where I'm essentially waiting for my next chance to get out and about, and procrastinating every else in-between. I have unpaid bills, my friends are clearly starting to become aware of how long I've been unemployed (currently five months) and I'm basically staying perfectly still in the hopes that if I don't make any sudden moves, everything will be ok

I'm 25 years old and a Marine veteran. I never saw actual combat, and got a few letters of commendation for that. I joined up pretty early in my life, basically straight out of high school, where I had friends but felt more like a loner for most of my life. I couldn't tell you why. I was always picked on and called names that I didn't understand because my family is Catholic and since this was before the coming of the all-mighty Internet, I couldn't very well look up any of the names they were calling me. I had a temper too; in 3rd grade I stabbed another child with a pencil, and got in trouble for numerous fights while in school. Not many things comforted me, especially after my family moved to a neighborhood mainly comprised of retirees. Reading did, but there were only so many times and places I could practice. I became proficient and switched my focus to baritone/euphonium. In high school

Eight years after that and here I am. I spent five years in the Marines, but my weight and office politics took hold, and so I received an Honorable Discharge and moved back in with my family, where I got a job at GameStop and started going to college.

I've finally made it to the point where my manager wants to promote me and I'm attending a major university for Computer Science

I feel alone, she decided to stop seeing me. My second was on the same base, with a very clingy sailor who wanted to merge our bank accounts after the first two or three days. Being 18 at the time, I immediately got hives and left her after a few more days. After that, it never felt like I should start another relationship; I never knew what was going to happen next and it wouldn't be fair to whomever I was dating if I had to go to Iraq or move to a new base. 

After my discharge, though, I met someone, let's call her Gina. Gina and I met completely randomly; we were assigned to be lab partners when she finally showed up to lab after spending a week sorting out her financial aid. We ""hit it off"" and started spending time together, ostensibly to study (which we did a lot of) as well as becoming somewhat romantically involved to a point. She didn't want to become too attached because of her ex-boyfriend at the time. And then I ended up moving an hour away to the university, where it became much more difficult for us to spend time together. Then she had one of her closest friends pass away, and moved in with her friend's family to help take care of everything. Fast-forward a few months, and she lets me know that her friend's 42 year old widower has proposed and Gina accepted.

I almost turned my store into a war zone.

She says she loves him. And I have/am accepting this; there's no way around it.

But I really don't think I can find anyone else like her again. She woke up a part of me that I really didn't think existed; she taught me what it was like to feel actual love and not the platitudes that I say to my immediate family. Will I always love her? In my own way

And so I joined OKCupid and Plenty of Fish,"" I'm tired of being alone. I just want someone who can accept and love me for me while encouraging me to grow and change along the paths that I choose, and who I can love and grow with.

The problem seems to be that I don't have enough self-confidence. Whenever I talk to conventionally pretty women, when I do dance. I weigh over 280 lbs.

     He lived about 3 hours from me and after talking for a bit told me that he didn't want to do a long distance relationship.  So, we found out that I was pregnant.  We were both upset, but knew we did it to ourselves and had to step up to the plate.  I met his parents and basically told them I was pregnant.  That was crazy, but they had nothing but open arms for me. 
   After a few months of being pregnant and my bf working all the time to save up, he did too.  
   Everything was great.  We got along, my bf went to this ''ACTORS EXPO"" and decided he wanted to go to school in NYC.  This is where things started to change.  I feel as if I didn't have a choice in this and it didn't matter what I said.  He wanted to become an actor and just couldn't do that in LA.  I thought he would go to school in NYC and then come back home.  I had a 9 month old, was about to start college myself, and now my bf was moving 1400 miles away to follow his dream.  I completely supported him by the way.  I never tell someone that their dreams are outrageous or not acceptable.
   In September 2010 my bf left me and our child with his parents in LA to go to NYC.  HE LEFT!!! AND MADE IT SEEM EASY!  I know it couldn't have been
   He missed so many firsts for our child.  Her first steps, and the other holidays as well.  The kicker to this is that Allyson thought her daddy was a computer screen, but it's what he wanted so I let him go for it.  The consequences of this were manageable, but not ideal.  I had to raise her alone (with his parents) and we got to see each other probably twice a year.  It was hard, but I fell in love with him and not a phone.  
    In June 2012(almost 2 years later), and moved to New Jersey to be a family.  This is really the only thing that I wanted.  To have her father raise her and be happy as a family.  
   In September
  
   I started feeling alone.  I missed LA so much.  I was having fun.  I wanted to be with my family and friends again.  I had a lot going on in my head and LA is where I wanted to be.  In December I got a call saying my PawPaw only had 2-3 weeks left.  I was on the plane out 2 days later.  We lost my grandfather on January 3, I had lost the girl/woman I wanted to be.  I am a country loving, hard-headed, outdoorsy type person.  I love camping and fishing and mud riding and he is the polar opposite.  Give him a game console and a computer and he is fine.  We wouldn't go out to bars because he said he didn't like it.  We would stay inside and I was fading away. I told him how I was feeling but didn't want to make any decisions over the phone. 
   Anyways, and kept pushing me to talk about my PawPaw.  I insisted I wasn't ready, but one night he pushed me too far and I laid things out for him.  How I hated it in the city, being away from my family and friends, being alone and feeling alone although he was right there.  Things got heated and I told him I was leaving.  For about 2 weeks I organized my thoughts and paper work and tried to come up the the $3000 to move back home.  We were civil and I insisted that he could keep in touch with our daughter.  I just wasnt happy here.  
    After things had cooled down, and KEEP his family  or 2. Stay here to chase his dream and LOSE his family.   I said I'd never make him choose, but I'm tired of not going anywhere.  He didn't want to talk about it and when we did he said I was being a bitch and forcing him to choose.  In my eyes, it was black and white..plain and simple.  My family would win in an instant.  There wouldn't even be a choice.  
  A 4 year relationship, and a year (almost) of me giving up EVERYTHING at a chance to make us work and I have NO proposal, feel more alone now than ever, and I am still raising our daughter for the most part.  I know nothing of this place, have 1 friend out here, no family, no car
