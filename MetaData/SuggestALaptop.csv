**What is Clevo?**

Clevo is an original design manufacturer (ODM) who creates shells of laptops (the chassis and the specifications). Clevo then sells these shells to other companies who then fill in these shells with components and sells them to us. Many companies such as Sager, Falcon Northwest and pre-Dell Alienware use Clevo shells for their offerings. It may not be a name someone off the street would know, but many computer forums recommend their products for their power and their price efficiency. Here is a good but slightly outdated document that explains what Clevo is: http://forum.notebookreview.com/sager-clevo/592609-clevo-guide-v3-0-faq-reseller-info-read-before-posting.html  .

**General Notes about Clevo Laptops**

* Clevo laptops are very value-oriented. To receive the same level of performance that one can find in Clevo models with another company you can expect to pay a significant amount more. This does not mean that the laptops are cheaply built. Many people have had their Clevo laptops for 3+ years.

* When people hear of the Clevo models that have replaceable CPUs/GPUs, newer CPUs and GPUs have different sockets. GPUs are currently MXM 3.0b, which hasn't changed for a while, but different Intel processors always need a new motherboard since the socket changes. If you only want to buy a Clevo because it can upgrade to a Haswell processor (Intel's next step after Ivy Bridge), don't do it.

* All Clevo models have Optimus technology for Nvidia GPUs or the AMD equivalent for AMD GPUs.

* The optical drive in Clevo models can be swapped out for another hard drive. This is how many people get 2 drives in their laptops. A external CD drive can be used with the laptop.

* Make sure that the machine you are ordering has Windows selected if you want it. Not everyone offers it in the base model.

* Expect most Clevo models to be around a size up from what their screen size suggests. What I mean by this is that my 15” P150EM will barely fit in a 15” case

* The power bricks that are included with these laptops are really large. If you are reluctant to buy a laptop with a large power brick do not buy a Clevo model.

* I would not say that Clevo laptops have a level of construction similar to a Macbook Pro or some Thinkpads. Mine at least has minimal flex

* [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/up66m/clevo_guide_v20/c4xcsan) as more.

**Clevo Laptops**

*Clevo W150ER*

This is the point where in my opinion you should start looking at Clevo offerings. This is a 15” laptop with 2 hard drive bays and an optical drive, is made with plastic, the GPU is not removable (it's soldered to the motherboard) and it has 2 RAM slots.

*Clevo W170ER*

This is a bigger version of the W150ER. It is essentially the same model as the 150ER but with a 17”screen size

*Clevo W110ER*

This is a small form factor laptop (11”) with the capability to hold only 1 hard drive, which is not something any other 11” laptop can do at the moment. It is made using plastic.

*Clevo P151EM*

This is a strong gaming laptop. It has a 15” screen but only 1 hard drive bay and an optical drive, as well as the ability to replace both the CPU and the GPU down the line, and is made using plastic.

*Clevo P150EM*

It is similar to the P151EM, and it has a rubberized finish as opposed to a plastic finish.

*Clevo P170EM*

This is similar to the P150EM, as well as some aluminum on the palmrest and an even bigger power supply (220W). It weighs 8.6lb (3.9kg).

*Clevo P270WM*

This is an upcoming model. It will contain a high end desktop processor, and an earth-shattering 30 minutes of battery life. It is not portable weighing in at around 12lb (5.4kg). This is quite literally a moveable desktop.

**How to upgrade a Clevo laptop (and the ideas apply to most other laptops)**

To do this I shall be going through the options available while configuring a P170EM on mythlogic (Mythlogic Pollux 1712) and factoring in a few differences from other laptops.

**Screen**

All of the Clevo models that I have laid out above (with the exception of the W110ER) come with 1080p screens. This is good.

One of the decisions that has to be made is whether to choose a glossy or a matte screen. Matte screens are sunlight-readable and non-reflective

Another choice to make is the colour gamut of the screen that you are choosing. The colour gamut is expressed as a percentage of the NTSC colour gamut (which is a colour spectrum involving all the colours the eye can see). The higher the percentage the more colours the screen can show. To see all the colours in the Adobe spectrum

It is worth noting that some people will see the differences and some can't. My mother can point out “look at that shade of blue” while I cannot see the difference when comparing it to another screen. Don't expect everything to be amazing. I will say that my 95% screen has a very nice colour saturation though.

Here is a nice [post](http://forum.notebookreview.com/sager-clevo/553185-visual-differences-between-different-screen-options-photos.html#post7132014) by mythlogic that shows the differences between the screens.

**Colour Calibration**

If you take colour calibration

**CPU**

Many people go for the largest number with CPUs. Don't.

A CPU performs millions of calculations per second and is the brain of your computer. Anyone doing large amounts of number crunching/calculations or people who are doing photo/video editing heavily should look for a powerful CPU

Ivy Bridge is the latest line of processors released by Intel. Ivy Bridge processors can be identified by the designation iY-3XXX(Q)M.

* The Y represents the lineup and can be either 3

* The “3” represents that a CPU is Ivy Bridge. If you see a “2”

* If the model number ends with only M (mobile), which means that each core can support 2 threads. This leaves the thread count on the i3s, i5s and i7 dual cores at 4 and the i7 quad cores at 8.

* [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/uoad8/i3_i5_i7_oh_my/c4x3mts) is a great explanation by LordAlfredo about the differences between the Intel CPU lineups.

I would recommend that most people buying Clevo models opt for the i7-3610QM. It is sufficiently powerful for gaming/heavy multitasking and a large upgrade over the i5s on offer. An i5 model will not however limit your gaming/everyday capabilities

For power users (people looking to do calculations or photo/video editing) I would go with a i7-3720QM. It is the best CPU in terms of price efficiency. Any higher would be a waste of money.

**Thermal Compound**

Upgrading the thermal compound to the IC Diamond can lower the temperatures of your laptop by up to 5 degrees. The upgrade is however rather expensive at most vendors.

If you feel comfortable enough to open your laptop and do the pasting yourself, then consider the upgrade.",,False,,t5_2s4k5,1339108335.0,,

Mine got delivered earlier today and I thought I would give you guys some information. I think I'll do a Q and A next week after I have a chance to test out some of my games.

The model that I bought is the one listed on newegg.com. It shipped in 3 business days and I didn't have to go through the hassles of lenovo shipping. I used the code PCREFRESH13 and got it for $1050.

-The one on newegg is listed as having an 8GB caching ssd. This is incorrect

-It does have dual 750m graphics cards in SLI

-The OS is not installed on the ssd.

-Even with almost no files installed on the ssd

-I currently have 840GB free out of an 884GB usable. There are only 25GB in the folders visable when I open the C:// drive. The OS takes up 19GB and I suspect that there is also a hidden recovery partition. I have installed a few programs like steam and java

-Windows 8 feels very fast and I actually like it quite a lot. I have installed Start8 though

-The track pad is *ok*. You can left click anywhere on its surface by either lightly tapping or pushing it down until it physically clicks. You right click by physcially pressing the bottom right area. It is definitely functional but I prefer to use my wireless mouse. There is a large deck area to the right of the track pad which is great for using a mouse if you don not have a desk. Cursor movement on the trackpad works well when I'm pulling my finger across it. It is difficult and there is lots of friction when pushing my finger

-When just web browsing the laptop temperatures are very cool and the fans are silent. It does get slightly warm

-the only game that I've had a chance to try so far is minecraft. When I start that

-The keyboard is fantastic. The backlight is not too bright. The right shift and backspace keys are a bit smaller than I'm used to

-The screen is very good. It is 1080x1920 and matte. The blacks are black and the colors are vibrant. The screen is also very bright. When used in front of the sun it does it hard to see

-The laptop is much lighter than I expected. It's definitely portable and I can stand up, on the other hand, is huge. It weighs almost as much as the laptop does.

-Battery life is ok. It's almost out as I type this and I've been using it for the last two and a half hours on full brightness. Battery life while gaming is probably closer to an hour and a half but that is a guess.

I'll try to answer any other questions you guys might have but I can't say much as for performance yet.

Update: I tried out skyrim last night. SLI started up and both sides started blowing warm air

* i5 processor (able to bump this up to an i7)

* 8 gigs of DDR3
* wireless and bluetooth

I was slightly on a budget, the GPU is user upgradeable so if it starts dragging me down in the future I'll just replace it. Upgraded to the i7-2670QM for $70, downgraded the memory from 1600 to 1333 to save $50, slapped in a hard drive caddy for 15$. Total damage was something like $1134, no tax, free shipping from XoticPC. If you're a member of notebookreview or a student or military there's discounts for you. I am none of these things, so no discounts for me.

Customer service was nice. They assigned me a rep who updated me through the process and was available the couple times I needed to call (I forgot the hard drive caddy when I first ordered it

Impressions:

This thing is the most nondescript laptop I have ever seen in my life. I chose the ""Remove all branding"" option, completely matte black nondescript laptop. It looks like a movie prop. I like it.

Optimus switching seems to be nice

The screen is a very nice matte 1960x1080. I likes it. Alot. Having that resolution at 15.6 inches makes things look good. Even the character models in Diablo III (I kid

Fans aren't loud. You can hear them but it doesn't sound like a jet is taking off like some laptops I have used. Haven't noticed it heating up terribly but I haven't really stressed it yet.

And in case you were wondering

Waiting for Ivy Bridge? Meh. Slightly increased processing power and lower power usage. Less overclock friendly. Probably good for laptops. Will I be doing anything in the next 3 years that I will rue the day I didn't wait for Ivy? No.

So there you go. For whoever cares. Like people who are constantly asking for a sweet gaming laptop around $1000 dollars.

Stories about how Windows 8 is just a step backwards in Microsoft's vision for its operating system needlessly narrowed my selection of laptops to choose from, since I basically looked at Win7 laptops only.



The only experience with Win8 that I had was at stores when I was playing around with touchscreen laptops. Only after a few minutes, I was willing to give Win8 a try, even before I tested out the laptops. I even thought about downgrading to Win7, like others have done.

I found that to be unnecessary.

Windows 8's learning curve wasn't steep for me. Seriously, there are many options to [bring back or simulate that familiar Start button.](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/3-ways-to-tweak-windows-8-to-look-more-like-windows-7/)

From my research and the help of /r/SuggestALaptop, and the thought of being able to buy two laptops for a macbook just seemed silly to me.

The shipping only took about two weeks, but it's more of a black brushed aluminum casing on the outside. While the advertisement says that the keyboard area is plastic, it feels like it's made of metal, and it's a comfortable area for your palm to rest on.

The keyboard is absolutely wonderful. Having been typing on my old Envy 14 for the last two years, and the extended area on the bottom of the keys really helps your accuracy. The only thing that I would have liked to change is to have a larger backspace and shift key.

The sound quality is amazing as well. HP advertises their laptops with the ""beats"" brand, and have a better range of sound. But the best part is when you plug in a good pair of headphones. I have a pair of Audio Technica M50s, and I have never heard music better than on this laptop. The soundstage, the accuracy of the sound is so much better than my old HP.

I also ordered this laptop with a 1080p display, especially for the price that you're paying. 

The battery life on this laptop is surprisingly good. I get on average of about 5 hours with my brightness set to a reasonable level.

The cooling system is also amazing. While the laptop is quite thick at 1.5 inches

Now, especially with the charger. It also doesn't feel as sturdy as other laptops. There's visible flex around the palm rest area, and the keyboard has quite a lot of flex all over it. The plastic insert where the keyboard is also is not flush to the system either.

A lot of people have been complaining about the touchpad

When I ordered this laptop, you have to manually install the drivers for windows 7. This can be kind of annoying, especially since there is a specific order for installation, and some of the drivers provided on Lenovo's website don't work.

So in conclusion, performance, and overall design, I would definitely buy it again. Hope this helped a little bit.

It has a quad core i7 3635QM CPU, allowing a max of 12GB), a 1920x1080 touch screen, the 8770 GPU with 1GB of video memory, and a 1TB 5400 RPM hard disk with no ""Expresscache""/SSD caching.  Battery life is being reported by the few who have picked them up to be a little over 6 hours.

The Samsung model number is NP780Z5E-S01UB, people are buying them in stores and I've seen a couple of unboxing videos and pics already.  The BestBuy SKU is supposed to be BB13706062, so in theory you could call around and see who has them in stock.  There should be an NP780Z5E-S01US which may well be identical in most (or all) ways, and I'd expect to see it showing up shortly at other retailers.

There is also supposed to be an NP780Z5E-S02 (US or UB?  Both?) model that will be coming in the future with 16GB of RAM and the AMD Radeon 8870 2GB GPU that was shown at CES.  It is rumored to cost $1699.  The 8870 GPU in this one is claimed (by AMD) to be about 70% faster than the nVidia GT650M.  I've heard others say more like 40% faster, but I'd call either of them quite good for the amount of power they're packing.

These S02 models haven't been seen in the wild yet, if not possibly a little sooner.  Still, I'm guessing you've got over a month to go.

FWIW, with arguably better build quality.

Pros: 

* Under 3 lbs
* Very sturdy with great build quality.
* Very quiet like a ninja.
* Looks really smooth. Solid black all over. The official Batman laptop.
* Unbelievably comfortable keyboard. Could type all day on it.
* Extremely slick and responsive trackpad
* Also has the mouse nub if you're into those
* Charges faster than anything I've ever seen before
* Matte screen (pro for fiancee
* Backlit keyboard
* 1600x900 resolution
* Lenovo is an unbelievable company. Contacted and got a personal response from one of their executives due to problems with order. Also their warranty support for the Thinkpad line is US based and gives you the rockstar treatment if you ever need service.
* If you look around you can get a great deal on them. Mine has better specs and a better warranty than a MBA *AND* it was cheaper.

Cons:

* Gets quite warm on the bottom if you're doing anything other than word processing/web browsing
* Ports are a little skimpy. Only 2 USB; Ethernet takes up 1 of the 2. Mini display port only. It does have a sd card slot and a sim card slot though.
* Speakers/webcam are both just average.
* Picks up fingerprints
* Only 5 hour battery life
* Don't even think about playing most games made within the last 5 years other than on ultra low settings. 
* Doesn't do dishes or dispense $100 bills

One design flaw that drives me insane is with the function keys.  The F5 and F6 keys are the function+volume up/down keys.  Now, the fan runs at 100% and will not stop until I reboot it.

I've also had a problem with the right speaker buzzing with the volume around 70% or higher, which brings me to my next point.

I ordered the device from XoticPC.  Their customer service for purchasing the product was fantastic.  Fast responses, I have been trying to get an RMA set up for 11 days now and am lucky to get 1 response a day from the service/support team from XoticPC.  I realize that they have to relay information to Sager, but an RMA for a defective laptop should not take 11 days to simply get a shipping label for an RMA.

The slow 1 TB drive is probably the biggest deal-breaker people would have with this laptop

- Cold boot to login screen: 12 sec
- Restart from login screen to login screen: 42 sec
- Wake from sleep: 2 sec
- Login screen to desktop: 10 sec

I'm not too bothered by boot times, as Windows eats 100% of your HDD for a few seconds. Using sleep mode instead of shut down as often as possible is strongly suggested anyway, but it's mostly going to be frustrating when you're setting up your laptop for the first time and configuring lots of software and updates. I hardly notice it now that I'm all done with that.


I've also heard the HDD bay is smaller than usual


**Heat Management**


- Idles around 45-47C in lousy air-conditioning
- Peaks at 78-80C in most games without a cooling pad
- Maximum so far has been 82-84C (BF3) after long use
- Cools down from peak to idle temps in just a couple of minutes


The internal design directs heat to the strip between the keyboard and the screen


**Chassis


The bottom is a single plastic cover, but the screen has a fair bit. The hinge runs along the entire back side, and is very sturdy for typical use compared to the 2-small-hinge design I had last, but does have a little wobble when using the touch screen.


Some people say the bottom is hard to remove - but all that's really different is a few clips on the inside edges that you have to pop open after the screws. The entire bottom plate comes off


The laptop is very portable at 0.9"" thick, but would be a little less convenient for southpaws.


**Display**


The 1080p sreen is often reported as a TN panel, nothing like the last TN I used whatsoever). The reported downsides of an MVA are that it can be grainier and prone to ghosting. I can see the grainy quality a little bit on a white background, but not really anywhere else, and it's no different from the TN panel I had last - but I've never had an IPS screen laptop to compare. I also haven't experienced any ghosting on this unit, so it might only appear on a bad unit or after an unrealistically long time. The glass touchscreen cover is very easy to wipe clean with any sort of fabric.


Some reviews have said it doesn't live up to the promised 300 nits brightness, but mine is either fully glossy or semi-glossy, because there is still a fair amount of reflection on low brightness. However, the screen gets bright enough that I don't notice it indoors and can still use it comfortably in direct sunlight.


The viewing angles are terrific - there is no color inversion or distortion of any kind at any angle, and color spectrum coverage - reviews have it put right next to the rMBP. There are also several color mode presets from Samsung.


**Keyboard and Touchpad**

There is no separate back-plate behind the keyboard for internal access, and the labels on the keys are transparent, so the light is not just around the edges. There are no obnoxiously sized keys, though the numpad keys are smaller than the letter keys.


The touchpad is huge, with up to 4 finger support. The touchpad never spazzes out or does any unintended gestures. There are no dedicated buttons - the entire pad is a clickpad. Clicking the bottom right corner is supposed to right-click, which works fine in the OS, but doesn't work too well in certain applications. Thankfully the touchpad software lets you assign right-click to a different behavior, so it isn't a problem and is actually easier. Besides the normal stuff, here's what you can do:

- Right click with 2 finger tap or click
- Middle mouse click with 2 finger tap
- Forward/backward 3 finger side-swipes
- Open up Computer/File explorer with 3 finger up-swipe
- Alt+tab with 3 finger down-swipe
- Return to/toggle Desktop with 4 finger up-swipe

You can also pick from 3 different settings on how to drag&amp;drop - release on finger lift


**Battery and Power**


The battery is 91Wh and cannot be removed. This is really unfortunate for people who list it as a deal-breaker, which can be toggled on and off. The power adapter is 90W, so it's nice and small for carrying around, and the power draw has never exceeded 90W and throttled the system under heavy use.


On low brightness while browsing, I get about 10-12 hours. Doing similar things but on medium brightness, I still get 8-10 hours. On low brightness with browsing and running analysis code in MATLAB for long periods of time, I get about 4-6 hours. I haven't tried anything with wi-fi turned off, but one review marked it at almost 16 hours.


**Audio**


The JBL speaker systems are great and were the most surprising thing about this laptop for me. My previous HP had Beats audio with a subwoofer, but I also didn't notice any distortion at max volume.


**Wireless**


The network card is a dual channel, connection settings were a bit shaky on defaults. Most of these have been cleared up (see tweaks below) for home use, but I haven't had any chance to test it out in a crowded place.


**Software


If you decide to get one


- Before all else, and incurs 100% disk usage and high cpu usage for long periods of time. It will make your computer completely unusable after boots for several minutes, and will frequently bog you down after that, regardless of how long you leave the OS running. If you find a really bad review of this Samsung's performance, chances are it was some poor soul who didn't know to get rid of this bloatware.


- Do not uninstall Samsung's Settings.exe. It is critical for controlling some of the display, and power features, and you can only get some control back without it afaik.


- If you want to uninstall SWUpdate


- Install the BIOS update through SWUpdate


- To improve wireless connectivity, and it's easily toggled in the Settings if you want to use it periodically. I've also seen it recommended that you get a link to install Intel's wireless drivers without the software component, but I didn't need to try it.


- Some (particularly older models) Samsung laptops have been bricked by trying to install a Linux distro, [this post](http://forum.notebookreview.com/samsung/706510-samsung-laptops-bricked-using-uefi.html), and [this post](http://forum.notebookreview.com/samsung/702308-introducing-2013-series-7-chronos-amd-hd8870m.html), but I haven't tried it yet. You'll at least have to disable Fast BIOS, SecureBoot, and set the sub option to CSM+UEFI to be able to boot from a USB.


- The stock AMD drivers are something like version 9.3. They are upgradable, Sleep mode isn't.


- Disable automatic adjustment of the keyboard backlight and screen (""Enable adaptive brightness"" in the display section of advanced power profile settings). It works fairly well


- I've had AMD switchable graphics before, always Intel, or battery-dependent for any .exe, and it seems to work great.

(xpost /r/chromeos)",socarrat,17,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1hp7li/samsung_series_3_chromebook_the_first_12_hours_or/, so I wanted to give back a little.  I just picked up a Series 3 Chromebook

-----

So my Samsung Series 3 Chromebook arrived today, and the long wait for delivery overseas, it's finally in my hands.  


Opening up the box, of which there are many here in Korea.  The weight and dimensions are nice.  It weighs only a little more than my iPad 4 with a Belkin keyboard cover, but of course with a much more generous keyboard with a trackpad. The little Chrome logo is a delight, however.  And I appreciate the small and light PSU. 

Upon booting up, acceptably bright matte display with viewing angles that are actually in the obtuse range?  Heaven.  Having such low expectations for what a 'bad display' is, I was pleasantly surprised that the SS3's panel was more than acceptable. 

After the first few boots and updates, Spotify, fell down a few Wikipedia rabbit holes.  And it was all... Fine. **It was as it should be.** A little stuttery while scrolling certain sites (like The Verge), certain streaming video sites are a little rough.  But my whole thing was: if this Chromebook performed worse than a tablet as a browser, it was getting sent back.  And it's a keeper. It's not going anywhere. 

I'm a tabber--I can have up to 50 tabs open at any given time--and while I don't expect the SS3 to be able to keep up with that (my i5 laptop and my gaming desktop sometimes struggle to keep up), only to have it need to reload again. 

The keyboard is pretty good.  It's on par with my Asus N56, and is more than acceptable. It's a solid above average, a B+ in a category that usually strives for mediocre. 

Battery life seems to be pretty damned decent so far.  I've been running it on battery power from 100% for 2.5 hours, I'm at 56%, with a stated remaining runtime of 3h52.  Pretty happy with that. If I can get a solid 5 hours of 10+ tabs, video and music streaming, with decent standby time... Well, can't ask for more than that! My old Asus 1015PEM wouldn't go more than 3 hours, and that's if I was being judicious about my energy usage.  With the Chromebook

**Edit: I let the battery run down to 8%. I ended up getting battery life (screen on) just shy of five hours with the conditions above

-------
My few complaints with the hardware include:
 
-Trackpad.  Very decent, I hope the trackpad abilities follow suit.

-There's a creaky bit right under my right palm.  It's a bit annoying, but it doesn't make the loud clicking noise it used to.**

-VPN support.  For some reason

-Speakers. Eh

-----

A couple of nice surprises:

-Love

-Dedicated function keys.  No more having to hit Fn. 

------

I'm a bit of a gadget hoarder, and Lumia 920, and Motorola Defy, all of which have their uses in my life. My main rig at home is a mid-range gaming desktop.  I have an Asus N56 at work, and use a 2006 Macbook as my browsing machine. iPad 4 and Galaxy Note 10.1.  Oh, and an old rooted Nook Color that I use as a desk clock. 

I'm looking to simplify my digital life.  This Chromebook does a great job where so many other devices were ridden with compromise.  My other choice was the Asus Transformer Infinity TF700t--beautiful screen, so I don't want something I have to babysit.  The seconds I save by being able to slam the lid shut, throw it in my bag and be on my way, the happier I am.  *I love this Chromebook because it feels less like a possession and more like a tool.*  $250 isn't pocket change, but if I have to buy another one for some reason, I won't have trouble making rent next month. 

I can safely say that the SS3 replaces the Macbook, television and radio host) I'm often on the road all day, having to write and edit scripts, menus, and email on the fly.  I can't wait to throw a SIM in here to see what it's like to be out in the field and being able to do research.

Now the old laptop is dying and I find that I've tried to do some gaming on it

I want to completely separate my life into two machines to keep myself productive but not to severely limit myself (I work well when I have work-only spaces).

Laptop 1: Work:
Needs to be extraordinarily cheap and have a minimalist feel to it. My work and future schooling only requires text editing. I travel while I work, and with a long battery life would be ideal.
I was thinking of getting a chromebook for this. The cheapest samsung one (the 250$). Does the starting level one do google docs offline effectively? (or do you need the new 550?) I read something about not being able to start new documents offline.... Anyone have any experience?

Computer 2: Luxury:
I'm going to want to have fun on the computer and I prefer segmenting it off into a different place. This can afford to be clunkier. I would like it able to play something like Skyrim well, other software, and all that jazz. Something I could come back home to while I travel.

I'll try one of those forms for it:

I've played a fair amount of DOTA2 on this machine. It runs it very well as DOTA isn't a demanding game. The rumors about the machine heating up when playing games are true. It does get quite hot. But, and from what I understand, the heat shouldn't damage the machine itself unless you are gaming for 6-8+ hours without giving it a break. I am 26 and don't have that type of time. So it's not an issue for me. But, if some of you 16 year olds out there are looking at this MSI, that may be an issue for you. It's a personal thing.

I guess I should start by saying that my current laptop is my primary/only computer, I would like to get the most bang for my buck, and while I don't do anything thats going to require the absolute best specs possible, I would like this to be relatively future-proof. It would be awesome if I could get another 5 years out of my next laptop.

Obviously there are performance differences as well as a price point differences between the three. I've been leaning towards the 6165 (with processor upgraded to IB)

some questions:  

* it seems that only the 9150 has a GPU that is user upgradeable

* I was thinking I would keep the optical drive as a DVD drive (or maybe even upgrade to a blu-ray drive) as I do not have currently a TV or dvd player
With that in mind, and have a HDD for regular storage. Would you recommend doing this before upgrading to either of the other models?

* Along the same lines, but didnt want to make any assumptions. Since it comes in 40 or 80 GB, would I need to go the full 80 for it to work properly as a boot drive?

Other general questions:  

* Will I notice any difference between the GPU's if I upgrade? I plan on buying Diablo 3

* Is it worth the $70/$95 to upgrade the screen to the 95% gamut option?

* I have seen others suggest doing the harddrive caddy for the optical drive, would it be possible to go with the 6165 (with HDD) and select no hard drive for the second internal drive; then buy a 120 SSD and swap it myself that way instead? (the advantage being that I could keep my optical drive as a DVD/blu-ray player)

Any insight is welcome, able to run diablo 3 comfortably, and relatively ""future-proof""

I am a computer science major who is a fairly competitive starcraft 2 player (high masters level) with a $800-1000 price range. I was looking for a laptop that could handle a medium to heavy amount of gaming (and word processing / internet browsing / coding). I'm stating this because i'v noticed many of you on this subreddit are looking to do similar things.

The cost of this laptop in it's stock form was $849.00. As with some other custom laptops, but it would be worth investigating. The stock specs for this laptop are [here](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np5165-clevo-w150hr-p-3063.html). If you plan on investing in this machine, I would advise upgrading to 6Gig of ram for an extra $25 (worth it), and upgrade to the 500Gig hard drive for only $15(also worth it).

Aesthetically, with very little heat problems (I imagine this would be totally nulled with a laptop pad). The screen is excellent, and displays well in all lighting. They keyboard is great and even comes with a num pad and fingerprint reader (biometrics ftw!). Some cons about the aesthetics: I'm not a huge fan of the touch pad that this comp comes with, because the surface is slightly rough, and with use has smoothed out. When closed this laptop gathers fingerprints easily.

Sound: If you want a computer with great sound

Speed: This computer is fucking fast. It boots up in like 5 seconds, skype and many browser tabs open. It gets a little warm while doing all this, but it's expected. While not streaming, pure ultra settings is easily playable. I anticipate being able to play Skyrim on mostly high settings without much difficulty. The video card is utterly sick for a laptop.

Battery / components: I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of battery life this delivered for such an expensive laptop. It will last 3-5 hours with the display dimmed doing an average amount of browsing the internet. I've been able to watch an entire movie (2 and a half hours) with full display and sound before it shut off (like 15% remaining) so that's pretty good I suppose. I'm not exactly a hardware expert, but all my experience with it has been great. The laptop also came with a disk of drivers. It comes with plenty of USB ports and other ports. I should also mention that I do a lot of gaming with a keyboard / mouse / monitor setup that works incredibly well. I'm aware that you could manage a dual monitor setup this way, but I haven't needed to figure out how to set that up yet. I mentioned being able to play SC2 online while live-broadcasting, but I didn't mention that I'm able to do this with the built-in wireless internet. Not sure if that is groundbreaking or not, but I thought for sure I would have to plug in ethernet to do it.

Overall impressions: Very satisfied with the product. I have had no glaring issues with it (other than the sound

Final thoughts: Great laptop

Good luck in your comp search!

Im a pretty computer literate person. My model is the one from newegg with SLI 750m and 12GB of ram. It cost $1150 but i got it for $1050 with the June $100 ecoupon. I received it almost exactly 2 months ago. I have not done any kind of overclocking or hardware modification. My power charger is plugged into a surge protector. My laptop started to fail about one hour ago and is now not functional. 

I had been playing Hitman: Absolution for about 20 minutes. My laptop was sitting on my desk, so airflow was in no way restricted. I have played this game on this laptop for extended periods before and had no problems.

Suddenly, and still is, filled with a faint but noticeable acrid smell. 

When I tried I turn on he laptop

When I removed the 2nd GPU and booted up, I got the expected frame rates from the IGPU. The fans were running much louder than usual. When I shut down and reinserted the 2nd GPU and started again, both GPUs were recognized. Doing all of this lasted about 30 minutes from when it first crashed. While I was googling my symptoms the computer crashed again. It will not turn on. When I press the power button, the Lenovo logo appears as normal, but after a few seconds it shuts off. I am able to access the BIOS but it still shuts off almost instantly. I have tried with it plugged in, with it on battery, and with it plugged in without he battery. 

Nothing works. Now I'm here writing this post on my iPod touch. 

Obviously I will have to retun this to newegg. There is no reason that they wouldn't accept it. I'm not sure if I want them to replace it or if I should go with a different laptop. I'm strongly considering giving up on a high performance laptop and building a desktop. Would newegg refund the money I spent on the y510p to spend elsewhere? Or would they give me credit with them? Or would they demand that I get another y510p? I've never dealt with returning something that I bought online. I still have most of the packaging.

They've been doing these promotions every summer for a while now, and I split the cost with someone who wanted an iPod Touch to save a lot of money.



Windows PCs also have Back to School sales, Microsoft had a promotion were they gave you a free Xbox with the purchase of a PC, including laptops. I'm not sure if they'll repeat the promotion this year, especially with the release of the Xbone, but it can't hurt to check, right?

1372276711.0,1h4ouc,Short review of Sager NP8230,Plyerslyer33,17,1,21,"[Some photos](http://imgur.com/TiDrUvg,0qfBhY1,7nD4I1v


Sorry I forgot to include a picture of the left side but from left to right when looking at it its:an IEEE port (no idea), and an SD port. 

Sager NP 8230 is a 15.6 inch laptop that in my opinion is pretty amazing

When you first see it its a little bit of a behemoth especially since i was previously using a 13-inch Macbook. Its kind of blocky design , it doesn't fit in a 15.6 laptop case I think primarily because its a little thicker than most so he had to go ahead and get a random carrying case. I'm not sure what I'm going to do about that yet but I would guess just buy a specific Sager made 15.6 carrying case to solve that. I've been playing a multitude of games on it so far just trying things out, starting with Saint Row 3 to Bioshock Infinite, and mount and blade and for an old  school Dawn of War. Each game ran exceptionally with not issues with lagging or anything messing up at all game wise. Everything ran smoothly even when I was contantly downloading different things and left everything open as I was playing the games. Only thing was Infinite had a glitching line from left to right about 3/4 of the way up the screen but I minimized the game and then minimized some other windows and it fixed it, I pretty confident it wasn't the computer it was just some conflicting things fighting for dominance. 
First impressions once again are first its size and weight which I'm already used to after a day. and just how quickly it starts up and how it responds. The keyboard's keys are a little bigger than normal I think which is perfect because you quickly learn where each is but they're not to big to get in the way. The trackpad is a little odd however it feels like a fine grit of sandpaper and feels kinda weird at first and I prefer using a mouse but again thats also because I've been gaming so I haven't had the chance to get used to the trackpad. Okay this is a little funny the finger recognition isn't terrible

I'm sure I forgot some stuff so feel free to ask and I'll get to it as soon as I can. Overall I love this thing. ",,t5_2s4k5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1h4ouc/short_review_of_sager_np8230/
1372029555.0,1gxnr9,[User Review] Ideapad Y500,Rustysporkman,15,2,22,"I recently purchased an [Ideapad Y500](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/y-series/y500) after getting some advice from this subreddit. I'd like to give a hands-on initial review of it.

So, SLI, the works. This thing is a monster.

**PROS:**

* The keyboard feels great to type on. I know this is a little thing

* All the usual Windows 8 commands are in the function keys (Fn+whatever). You can turn off the mousepad, Wifi on/off. I really like this.

* Numpad! (Dell Studio lacks a numpad. I didn't even know how much I missed one).

* Battery life is good. They advertise 3 hours

* This thing handles graphics-intensive games like a CHAMP. I'm maxing out games and still having Spotify and Facebook in the background.

* The way this thing handles heat. It pushes the hot air out the left side

* It's build like a tank. Very solid construction.

**CONS:**

* This may be software

* It's a little heavy. Not brick heavy

* Price-wise

* The trackpad is pretty mediocre. It's the kind with the built-in mouse buttons

1370371601.0,1fo242,Do not purchase a Y500 SLI. It is a terrible laptop.,plimple,33,19,39,"Just putting my two cents in since people seem to think that this laptop is the best bang for your buck. I purchased the Y500 750m SLI version and it is one of the worst laptops I have ever owned. 

First, it feels like its going to fall through the case. Most trackpads that I've seen are part of the case, but not this one. Do not eat near the trackpad because you will get crumbs stuck between the crack of the pad and case.

Second, this is the deal breaker.

Third, but I have dealt with companies that were willing to go above and beyond to satisfy their customers. Lenovo is not one of those companies.

This is just a vent because I am so pissed off about my experience, but you can find better laptops for the same price. If you want a similar laptop, you are better off buying [this.](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np8230-clevo-p151sm1-p-5840.html)

Big thanks to evanstueve (http://www.reddit.com/user/evanstueve) for the suggestions / info. You should get commission from Apple for this. 

I confirmed w/ a rep that I can return it to a retail Apple store within 14 days of purchase, I've read that refurbished Apple products are more strictly screened than brand new ones. 

I'll install Windows 7 or 8 via boot-camp; hopefully I can still get 6-7 hours battery life. 

I also went for the Apple Financing

With taxes it came just shy of $2200; I think, the only other contender.

Thanks all. 






ORIGINAL POST: 



Price:

- I'm prepared to drop ~$2



Hardware requirements (FIRM):

- 4th gen Intel i7 quad core (probably narrows everything right down)

- Ability to drive a second monitor at 2560x1440 (I have one of those QHD monitors from Korea via eBay; I assume this means the laptop needs a display port)

- At least 8 GB of RAM (I often have many resource-hungry windows open at once; also see next point)

- Ability to leave laptop running on standby all the time, and close it, without having to power-up/restart

- Solid state hard drive

- Solid battery that will give me 6-8 hours runtime (I want to sit out on the balcony to play StarCraft or remote-login to work; I assume more cells is better)

- At least a 15"" screen



Hardware requirements (LOOSE):

- Touch screen would be nice

- Ultrabook-like dimensions and build would be preferred (I'd rather not lug around a giant gaming laptop

- Windows 8 or 7

- The Mac-book-style magnetic power cable plug



Software I most commonly use (mediocre given my hardware wants):

- StarCraft II / Portal 2

- Microsoft Office Suite

- Visual Studio 

- Remote-desktop-login to work

- Chrome

- Media Monkey / iTunes

- Photoshop / Paint Shop Pro / Paint.NET



Models I've considered:

- 17"" Razorbook (gorgeous; neato little touch-screen track pad; but it's pricey

- Asus Zenbook Infinity (but she's still a mystery

- Dell XPS 12 (if only it had a larger screen)



Questions:

0) Any experience with the Razorbook? Is it the cat's ass? 

1) Is there a website out there where I can just put in all the key characteristics

2) Also worth mentioning: I'm in Canada; I'm travelling to Las Vegas for a week in about two weeks. I'm not oppose to buying said laptop in the US during my visit. Is FRY's a good bet to buy from? I've never been. Only other US retailer I can think of would be Best Buy or Costco. (At least with Costco I believe I can buy from a US store and still return at a Canadian store.) 

3) Would a dedicated 2 or 3 GB NVidia graphics card be better than the latest Intel HD on-board graphics with shared memory with 8 or 12 GB of RAM? Primarily for StarCraft, whenever it comes out. 

4) Should I wait until Christmas



I think that's everything; many thanks in advance. ",,t5_2s4k5,1375237628.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1jcpn7/wanted_4th_gen_i7_quad_812_gb_ram_display_port/

1362091145.0,19fajg,$2000-2500 Gaming Desktop Replacement,Quazifuji,14,0,11,"**TL;DR** (Questionaire and other info and questions below): My current gaming laptop (a 4-year-old Toshiba Qosmio) has started overheating when I play games (initially it only happened with Borderlands 2

I'm looking for a desktop replacement in the $2000-2500 range (overall, and getting my money's worth than budget).  I'd like this computer to last at least 4-5 years, and don't want to encounter a game I can't run during that time, although I'm okay if I have to turn down the settings towards the end of its lifespan.  I'm very wary about overheating, since I've had a number of computers, including my current one, that I had to replace due to heating problems before performance became a huge issue (most recent one was already repaired once for overheating after 2.5 years before it started overheating again more recently).  

I'm currently mainly looking at the high-end Sager and MSI laptops

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: ~$1500-2500

* Purpose (netbook, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming, desktop replacement.

* Screen size preference: 15-17"".  Not a strong preference.  I may end up hooking it up to a keyboard and monitor and using it like a desktop most of the time anyway.

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows 7.  It's possible I'll install a Linux Dual Boot on it at some point

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Only game I specifically have in mind right now is Borderlands 2 (which causes my current gaming computer to overheat), I'd like to be able to run any game that comes out in the next 4-5 years without a problem (I'm okay if I can't play graphics-intense games on ultra settings 4 years from now, but I want to at least be able to play them on native resolution if I turn down the settings a bit).

* Performance requirements (video, but I usually use a different computer for that.  This computer will mostly be for gaming.

* Method of computer support (office supplier

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories
compatibility): No preference.  Whatever works best.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): No strong preference.  Not particularly into the flashy Alienware-style cases, but it's a bit much in my opinion).

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Probably low weight

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Mostly high performance, overheating in the past, and high performance does no good if the computer crashes due to overheating (my current gaming laptop can still maintain a framerate I'm okay with when playing games, it just crashes due to overheating after an hour or two, and it's already been to the shop once due to overheating problems a year and a half ago).  So ideally I'd like some mix of low heat and high performance.  Noise is not an important factor (I'd gladly take noisy fans if they reduced the risk of overheating problems).

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: I'd like 1080p

* A great keyboard: Not too picky about this

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Don't care at all.  I don't expect to ever use the touchpad.

* Great audio: Will usually use headphones

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, etc.): Can't think of anything.

**Some things I'm currently considering**:

Most people point to MSI or Sager for someone looking for a high-end gaming laptop who doesn't care about getting a flashy case, or 9570).  I'm also looking at the [Malibal Nine Series](http://www.malibal.com/notebooks/nine-x570se/), which I hadn't heard about until recently so I know very little about it, but it seems to offer similar specs to Sager and MSI for similar prices.

I'm particularly intrigued by the Sager NP9150 since it's much smaller and lighter than most comparable laptops (true, but worried that the smaller case might result in more heating problems than a larger laptop.  Is this a legitimate concern?

**Some specific questions:** 

In general, and which aren't worth it?  

For example:

* Is it worth spending the money to get a better CPU than the 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7 3630QM that most high-end gaming laptops have by default

* How much RAM is it worth getting?  

* Are the more expensive wireless LAN cards worth it (I will usually be using wireless

* Is it worth getting a solid state drive?  How large?

* SLI'd graphics cards?  I've had problems with these in the past, but they do seem to be touted as a big feature for gaming performance.  Are they potentially worth it, or am I better off going with a single graphics card to save money and reduce heat?",,False,,t5_2s4k5,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/19fajg/20002500_gaming_desktop_replacement/

1376163886.0,1k3rl4,Solutions for the y510p trackpad [x-post from r/Lenovo],tastynoms,16,2,9,"When I was debating getting the y510p

I just got the y510p and I love nearly everything about it.  Like many others

The left and right buttons are integrated with the touchpad itself, but then moving the pointer across the screen takes an equally annoying amount of effort.

My second problem is the fact that there's no edge scrolling, but my I had it on my last laptop for 6 years and became very accustomed to it.

  
Anyway

A) **behave as if it has two distinct mouse buttons** (dead zone for touch

B) **have one-finger vertical scrolling**

  
Solution:

1.)  Go to Programs and Features and uninstall your current Synaptics Pointing Device drivers.  Restart.

2.)  Reinstall the driver package from the Synaptics site (not Lenovo) here:  http://www.synaptics.com/resources/drivers  and then Restart.

3.)  In Control Panel

4.)  Highlight ""Scrolling"" and make sure it is checked.  Click the gear icon and then go activate vertical scrolling.  Configure other options according to your preferences.

5.)  To get a ""dead zone"" where the buttons should be, the dead zone will take awhile to activate after you lift your finger.  I prefer it to be immediate.

6.)  Explore the other settings and find what you like.  There are many more options that you don't get with the default Lenovo driver package.

Similar laptops.  

Lenovo has a better graphics card and comes with OS but may be prone to overheating.

Sager (Clevo) has a worse graphics card

I could probably get an OS image at school though.  

Anyone know laptops with similar specs for the same price?

First of all

As soon as I received my laptop, which takes a few minutes, and everything looks normal this time, except now my Wi-Fi doesn't work and the DVD drive doesn't work. I reset it one more time and try to install the drivers that came with the CD, but the problems were still there. After researching for hours online, it looks like I'll have to do the long reset, which takes 4-5 hours. And after that reset

I call Newegg and ask for an RMA, they will send it back and charge me for the shipping. So I do it and send it back.

After 7 business days of no emails or contact from Newegg, which I never received. After half an hour of explaining to her that the laptop malfunctioned from the start, that it was a general issue this laptop seems to have with many other owners, that my shipping was late and that I was not contacted whatsoever, she just kept repeating herself.

This ended up with her saying, which doesn't work, back to me. What the hell am I supposed to do? I can't even resell it because nobody else will buy a used, defective laptop!

**TL;DR I've paid for $790 for a malfunctioning laptop that I haven't had access to for over 2 weeks and Newegg won't seem to do anything about it.**

1370733244.0,1fy9u7,Do I want a gaming laptop for college?,GrimTuesday,11,1,10,"I'm entering college next year and I consider myself a medium, Arkham City

What I'm trying to do is figure out what I want to do for college next year and I think this subreddit can help me out, or get a cheap laptop and a gaming desktop, though I'm really not sure how much I want to lug a desktop to college. That said, a ~$850 desktop and $450 laptop would have total better performance and lighter weight than a single gaming laptop, though I don't know if the build quality on the laptop would be as good.

I think a gaming laptop would be ideal because it can act as both a gaming system when I want it and be portable for taking notes and the like. It would also be nice to be able to game when I come home for breaks and not have to worry about transferring files between two computers.

Here are a couple direct questions:

* How heavy is too heavy to carry around? Is 6 lbs too heavy? 6.8? Is there a significant difference between carrying around a low range 5 pounder and a high end 6-7 pounder?

* How much battery life is necessary? Could I get by on something that only has 2.5 (cough Y510p)? Something that has 4?

1351794271.0,12gx1f,Looking for a coding laptop,dionyziz,14,3,10,"Hello /r/SuggestALaptop. I'm looking for a new laptop. Here are my requirements.

**Requirements**

 * Must **ship to the EU**. Country of purchase is Greece. This means it can't ship from the US as there are huge applicable taxes
 * Must **cost up to €1100** (about $1400).
 * Screen size **must be on the 15'' mark**. I had a 17'' laptop that I found uncomfortable to carry around and 14'' is too small to work on.
 * A regular full-size keyboard

A few words about what I do. I will use it mainly for coding. This means a lot of programming work on a command line and working with text. Also occasionally chatting, and minor design work in Photoshop, and sometimes watching movies and listening to music. Long hours of working on it, so the screen must not be too tiring. I'm going to look at it often for more than 8 hours / day and it's going to be mainly text.

I'm also doing game development, so that's a ""nice to have"" if it can handle some modern games, although I don't need them to run at their best settings.

**Nice to haves**

 * Works well with both Windows and Linux
 * High screen resolution
 * Good keyboard where typing is smooth and fast. I've worked with an HP laptop and I like their keyboard.
 * A VGA port for a second screen.
 * Simple looks and design, holes and bumps are not appreciated. Although not hugely important, ""Thinkvantage"", ""Web"", ""Help"" etc. additional keyboard buttons are to be avoided.

**Preferred

 * SSD is better than HDD
 * NVIDIA is better than ATI
 * A matte screen is better than a glossy screen
 * Within reason: Long battery life is better than low weight
 * Within the above budget: Build quality is better than low price

**Don't care about**

 * I don't care if it has a DVD/CD/blu-ray drive. As long as it has a USB port to do OS installation
 * I don't care if it has HDMI/Ethernet ports
 * I don't care if it has multiple USB ports or USB 3.0 support
 * I don't care about SD card slots
 * I don't care if it has a big hard drive. Even 100GB is OK.
 * I don't care about audio as long as it's reasonable
 * I don't care if the battery is removable
 * I don't care about heat

A few of my initial impressions.  Windows 8 sucks monkey balls.  It sucks a lot less with a touch screen.  And even less still if you install one of the Start Menu add-ons.  But that has less to do with the Laptop and more to do with Widows.

Anyways, but to get a touchscreen, I guess there are no alternatives.  For those researching this laptop, I will make it easier for you guys and tell you that yes, it does indeed have a FHD display.  

A few other impressions, but not nearly as bad as I was expecting.  Also not nearly as bad as I expected is the keyboard.  In general, I don't like flat-keyed chicklet keyboards, but this one has a nice positive touch.  

Here are a few of the things I don't like:  

OMG, no kidding, 1/3 of the size of the one from Asus.  

The backlit keyboard is cool, of course, but then its hard to read the keys because they are aluminum on an aluminum background.  

The door on the optical drive is way too easy to open

My question to you is, is now the right time to buy.  I don't strictly NEED this laptop untill late september, but am worried that the price will go up before then, as the laptop is already reduced by a hefty amount.

First of all, and it can do everything you need it to do, then why not?  If you have a budget of 500, have you eyes on a $450 machine, but you find the same machine, used and in good condition, on Craigslist for $200
As for me, and this laptop, though adequate in its specs, somehow lagged when running a word processor, took a good 40 Seconds to boot up.  Now, I realize that the problem was that I was running Windows on it.  But that's not the point of this post.  About a year ago, the laptop died.  It, was about six years of age, I decided I'd just see if I could borrow my friend's laptop while saving for a new machine.  Now, I'd used linux before

Bottom line:
If you have a low, get a used laptop.  Before buying a used laptop from someone on craigslist, make sure it works.  Same principle as a car - demand to drive it around the block before buying it.  
If the existing OS is not running smoothly and it needs to be wiped/re-installed, crashing, or anything like that.  You've got OpenOffice for doing homework, VLC for playing movies, and everything you really need comes standard with most Linux distributions.  That, and Linux manages memory better, allowing you to do more with less.  So

Windows 8 is a dealbreaker. There is no price at which I am willing to accept Windows 8. I would loathe to register as a Win8 sale to microsoft

So I bought a Lenovo Y580 for $1008 after tax and shipping from NCIX. Then I bought 16GB RAM and and 500GB SSD for $542 at Canada Computers. Overall that's $1550 CAD for i7-3630QM, 16GB RAM, and 15.6"" 1080p screen. The keys are also cylindrical which is good.

It arrived today and I'm not super happy with it. The first thing I noticed (because I'm subscribed to /r/MechanicalKeyboards) is that the key spacing on the number pad is too small. Normal key spacing is 0.75"", this thing feels flimsy. The bottom is entirely plastic. It's not thick solid plastic, it feels cheap and flexible. I can feel the entire thing flex when I pick it up, and the disk tray and battery pack can be moved about with a little bit of pressure. Unlike my Mac which stays completely rigid when I pick it up with one hand. I haven't used it yet (or swapped out the memory and HDD) and I'm thinking about returning it.

**Necessary Features**

* Solid build quality
* Good gaming performance

**Preferred Features**

* Metal body

**Portability**
After talking to many people in college about laptops, but truthfully I miss a big 15” screen from time to time.  That being said, this thing is light.  It’s no MBA, but I have no problem holding it out in one hand.

**Keyboard**
Many people on forums are freaking out about Lenovo’s new “island-style” keyboards.  I never used the old version that much, with the ctrl key being to its right.  I’m used to it being the opposite, but I’ll get used to it.

**Trackpad**
The trackpad is very nice. After using my friends T420s

**Screen**
Could it be better?  Yeah, when you’re looking right at it (which you will be 90% of the time), it looks fine.  I wish this laptop could have the display of the Dell XPS 13 and it’d be a powerhouse.  Don’t let it dissuade you from buying this, just be aware of it.  If you’re doing word documents, redditing, spreadsheets, etc.

**Battery**
I have the 6 cell battery with the ultrabay battery.  I’m truthfully not sure exactly what the times are on it, and videos I can get through a full day on one charge.  If I had to guess I’d say somewhere around 7 hours.

**Extras**
The Trackpoint (red dot in the middle of the keyboard) is really nice.  I never got how people used it over an actual trackpad, I can tell.  The audio is average I’d say.  I listen to a wide array of music (hip-hop, dubstep, country, rock) and I did expect a little more from them.  They get loud enough, but not enough to fill a medium-large room.  Maybe I’m just used to my external 2.1 speakers.  I have heard some amazing reviews on Dell’s speakers though.  

All in all it’s a great laptop.  The only regrets/complaints about it I have are 1)screen size 2) screen quality 3) lack of a quad-core i7 4) speakers (this one’s being picky though).  If you have questions

Pros
----
- Long Battery Life
- Strong aluminum body and design
- Reliability (my dad has 3 Macbook Pros (work and other stuff) and they are all running great)
- Lightweight
- Trackpad and keyboard are really nice

Cons
----
- No GPU
- Gets hot
- Glossy screen might be an issue
- Poor screen resolution 
- Price (although with student discount and selling the giftcard it's around $1000)

1339476880.0,uxg41,P150EM review,moltenlead,14,2,18,"**Clevo P150EM Review**

I actually received this laptop closer to 1 month ago

**My Configuration**

My laptop is configured as follows: Pollux 1612 (Clevo P150EM): i7-3720QM | GTX 675m | 16GB 1600MHz RAM | Crucial M4 128gb + 500gb HDD | 95% matte screen | Intel 6300 .

**Mythlogic (Reseller)**

Mythlogic has been great throughout this entire process. Originally I was hesitant about ordering a laptop at a premium (around $100-150 on my configuration), when I had a few issues with Windows settings after setup they walked me through the entire process (I failed to specify that the laptop was to be in my name and not the cardholder's, so everything arrived calibrated for the cardholder).

I'd highly recommend them to anyone and everyone.

**Unboxing**

You can see the photos in the album that I've put below. I've also added some annotations in that album

I chose the USPS Express shipping option (middle choice)

I've removed any potential identifying information so don't think that there were boxes of colour on the package.

There was a lot of box-ception and a lot of packing peanuts. Beyond that I got the “concise” user guide, the laptop, a mousepad, a CD case with a recovery image and a Windows install.

I got a friend who ordered an NP9150 through XoticPC to get me an external optical drive since they were offering a $25 Blu-Ray Reader/DVD-RW/CD-RW

Yes

**Build Quality**

The build quality of this laptop is great. There is very little flex in the build and it is not brittle (although I still treat it like glass). It is not on the same level of construction as a MacBook pro though (the metal construction is still much more solid). As far as plastic based laptops go

**Ports**

Lots of ports! You could find a list on any of the Clevo seller sites (Xotic's one is good for this)

**Keyboard/Trackpad**

These seem to be the second most common complaints about Clevo laptops. I'm happy with the trackpad

I did however buy a Leopold FC 200r Tenkeyless keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches for on the go use. No laptop keyboard beats mechanical keyboards for typing and comfort (at least in my opinion).

Whoever thought that putting the sleep and mute shortcuts next to each other should have tomatoes thrown at them. It's annoying

**Speakers**

I don't really use them all that much. When I do the speakers are a bit loud but the bass is muted. This is probably because the subwoofer is below the laptop :/

The headphone ports are fine. If your sound sounds like it's missing some high-end frequencies

**Setup**

Everything was setup for me outside of the box

**Screen**

I can definitely notice the calibration and the saturation of the colours on this screen compared to other screens around my house. That being said, a standard matte would have probably sufficed).

**Temps**

Temps are fine for a laptop packing powerful hardware. I get around 40 degrees at idle

The fans are not noticeable while I'm using the laptop

The fans do rev up noticeably while gaming

**Fingerprint Reader**

It's a nifty thing that's worked for me. I use it to logon. The software doesn't seem to be very stable with Chrome so I don't use it otherwise

**Performance**

Performance is great all around. The SSD is noticeable and my entire experience is zippy.

I have not installed all the virtual machines that I plan on running just yet

I have run the games that I have (LoL/CS 1.6/D3) at maxed. I do not run SC2 at maxed since I opt for the highest possible fps when plying (so all low @1080p)

**Battery Life**

I get around 3.5 hours off battery with the power saver mode enabled. You need to be plugged in to activate the dedicated GPU

**Overall**

I like this laptop. Mine didn't have any problems out of the box and it works well. I think that I'll be happy with this laptop for quite a while.

1338551629.0,ufhqf,"Reliable laptop, &lt;$700, browsing, email, Netflix streaming",10,"Hi All! I'm saving for my wedding currently

**1) What is your budget?**
Since I'm saving for my wedding in January

**2) What size notebook would you prefer?**
I'd mainly be using it for web browsing/email &amp; watching netflix. I feel I could get away with anywhere from 12"" on the low end to 16"" on the high end; but you guys are the experts!

**3) Where will you buying this notebook? You can select the flag of your country as an indicator.**
I live on Long Island

**4) Are there any brands that you prefer or any you really don't like?**
I'm pretty open to anything that I can run windows on

**5) Would you consider laptops that are refurbished/redistributed?**
As long as they can last me a few years and/or I can get some warranty to ensure that is the case

**6) What are the primary tasks will you be performing with this notebook?**
As I mentioned above, &amp; streaming video (via netflix).

**7) Will you be taking the notebook with you to different places
Both, like when on vacation, I'll travel with it.

**8) Will you be playing games on your notebook? If so
Aside from the occasional flashed-based webgame and solitaire, no.

**9) How many hours of battery life do you need?**
I could go less if it'll help keep me in budget since, in theory I'd like a long battery life; but I'm willing to have less.

**10) Would you prefer to see the notebooks you're considering before purchasing it or buying a notebook on-line without seeing it is OK?**
Buying online is fine with me as long as it has good reviews from a trustworthy source (such as r/SuggestALaptop!)

**11) What OS do you prefer? Windows (XP or Vista or Windows 7), etc.**
Windows 7

Screen Specifics

**12) From the choices below
I usually set my resolution to the highest possible on whatever machine I'm using. I'm not a fan of the happy-new-year-1998 crowded display. That being said

**13) Do you want a Glossy/reflective screen or a Matte/non-glossy screen?**
I'm flexible with this. Whichever.


Build Quality and Design

**14) Are the notebook's looks and stylishness important to you?**
No; as long as they don't weight a ton or are bulky as hell I'm fine with it.

**15) When are you buying this laptop?**
Since we're currently computerless, given I want it to last for years, would theoretically be a better option...but the idea of going half a year without a computer doesn't sit well with me. So I'll probably be impatient and say ASAP.

**16) How long do you want this laptop to last?**
I'd say at least 3 years if that's at all possible.

Notebook Components

**17) How much hard drive space do you need; 80GB to 640GB? Do you want a SSD drive?**
I'm honestly not tech-savvy enough to know the benefits of an SSD drive. As for space

**18) Do you need an optical drive? If yes
Yes

**Upgrades:**

* 15.6"" 1920 x 1080 FHD LED AUO B156HW01 V.7 95% NTSC Glossy Display
* NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 675M (Fermi) 2GB GDDR5

This will be a multipurpose laptop.  I plan to use it for:

* Compiling – mainly C++ and python right now.  Nothing major
* Gaming – Tribes: Ascend, DiabloIII, Darkfall 2.0, ect
* Video and audio encoding
* Streaming HD video and audio to my home theater equipment

**Questions:**

* Would you recommend waiting for the Ivy bridges to come out?  The only reason that I would want it before they release

* How easy is it to install the SSD into the drive caddy?  I am pretty tech-savy
* Lastly

Edit:  Just talked to a rep from Malibal that said the caddy has a SATAII interface.  So I guess I will need to swap the SSD with the primary hard drive.

I am a college student

I guess the most important thing I'm looking for in a laptop is, as well as the CPU and GPU.

I have considered Clevo (Sager) products, but I'm not sure how I would feel about them three years later (if they even last that long). I say three years because that's the longest I've owned a laptop. Not only are they heavy, but I heard lenovo had a bad build quality (especially with the SLI), MSI had extremely bad overheating problems, and something about that clevo makes me want to throw it out the window.

My most recent decision was the Razer Blade 14. Now

Screen quality (I use another monitor a lot of the time

No ethernet port (I haven't used one in the last 5 years)

* Budget range: sub 450

* Purpose ultraportable (I think?)

* Screen size preference: 11-14 inches. preferably 12-13 inches

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): I prefer linux, since I use linux, I'll almost inevitably install it myself. The only foreseeable issue is if the hardware is very obscure and drivers are hard to find. 

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): not many/very low. Tf2

* Performance requirements (video

* Method of computer support (office supplier

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories
compatibility): none

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Thin and lightweight. An ultrabook would be the epitome

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: balanced

* Build quality -vs- Low price: balanced. I can't deny it

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: low noise/heat

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: nope. 720 is good enough thanks

* A great keyboard: If it's amazing I might be willing to bump up to the aforementioned 500. I type a lot

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: no. I wouldn't want a crappy touchpad or mouse buttons, but short of that, as long as they work I'm fine. Note: hardware should support two finger scrolling, although I can configure synaptics drivers myself  

* Great audio: no. Nowadays I think you'd be more hard pressed to find a laptop with completely shit speakers than not. I use headphones 95% of the time anyways.

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, etc.) 

Ethernet port, removable battery. A cd/optical drive would be nice if possible, but not required (As these seem to be getting phased out).

1) The Sony Vaio Z seemed nice, but it's only available in 13"" AND more expensive than the mac book pro when close to like-for-like.  Doesn't even have a GPU outside of intel built in.

I'm looking to buy a small, music, movies, etc). I don't play any computer games, so gaming performance isn't a factor. Also, the price isn't much of a factor, but I don't want to just throw money away by overpaying for the same configuration either.

I always thought that Macs were overpriced, and just in case I hate it, I can always bootcamp Windows.

Thoughts? I've seen similar questions on this subreddit

Also, or stick with the i5? And in the case of the Air, is it worthwhile to upgrade to 8GB of RAM or stick with 4? I know I don't need the laptop for anything too intensive right now, but I'm also looking to 'future-proof' it a bit, because I'd like it to last a while.

Thanks!!

NCIX's Esther posted a hands on with the system on her youtube [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0OFOqnMvHY&amp;feature=youtu.be). The system is made from mostly brushed aluminum, unlike the GT70, they included dual cooling fans, so the cooling performance should be better than the other MSI models. For those looking for a nicely portable system that still has a large screen and a decent GPU, this is a pretty attractive choice.

I imagine XoticPC will likely have it up this week (or even today) for those looking to customize the system (i.e. custom storage / proccesor).

1362279904.0,19k2sf,Looking for a Laptop $1500 or under. I want it to last longer than 4 years.,lepancake,9,0,6,"Hi! I'm looking to buy a new laptop to last me more than 4 years. Reason being that I've never gotten more than 2.5 out of a laptop and it's starting to put a limit to how much I can get done (in school) because they always end up having something wrong with them.

What I want is a laptop with good specs and a brand that is reputable for lasting a long time. My price limit is $1500

I use my laptop to do school work (Word, LoL, Minecraft and some occasional TF2 (reddit is also involved). The laptop I have right now is a [Samsung Q430-11](http://www.cnet.com/laptops/samsung-q430-11/4507-3121_7-34121948.html); it's is still good, but can't hold a charge and is nearing the end of its lifespan 2.5 years after purchase (what a surprise!).

I was looking at Lenovos, but that really isn't of concern because this (310M) runs everything I play on more than acceptable settings. 

Portability is also a big thing for me since i'll be moving it around campus every hour or so and it needs to be able to lock and resume quickly so I can get on with what I was doing. Battery life also falls under this category. It needs to last at least 5 hours every day (because I don't use it every period), which is ample. So any suggestions should have some good battery life.

So

Sorry for the waffle-y post, it's just the only one I've actually taken a serious look at.

1360966244.0,18lrza,13'' Laptop with good battery (looking for less expensive alternative to Macbook Pro),Thom-,9,0,2,"Hey guys

I'm using my Laptop mostly on vacations to save my photos on it as a vacation backup and to watch some movies on the airplane.
I'd like to use Lightroom on that device and maybe Photoshop (but thats just a bonus)

So what I need is a 13'' Laptop with a high battery life

According to notebookcheck.com the Mac can last around 7h while surfing - every other Laptop I looked into had just something around 5h.

So what I'm trying to decide right now is the following:
Should I buy the very expensive MBP for 1700EUR (I want the one with a 256GB SSD) and hope for a high reselling value on ebay? 
I checked the prices for 2 year old Macbooks and as far as I've seen you're loosing around 200EUR every two years. So while the start price is very high I could hope for a new laptop every two years by just adding 200EUR to my initial price.
You can check this on [heise.de for the prices in germany (look for the ""Gebrauchtpreis"" if interested)](http://www.heise.de/mac-and-i/produkte/macbook-pro/#produktliste)

The alternatives would be (hopefully) laptops in the 600EUR range - which I believe won't have a as near as good reselling value. I couldn't find a similar page for Lenovos for example like the heise.de page.

I'm not sure if thats even a good idea to look at the reselling value. I just heard it from a lot of Apple lovers that they're just buying every two years a new Macbook without loosing a lot of money.

I could get the student rabatt

I wouldn't buy a Apple device just because it's an apple. But I couldn't find a good 13'' Laptop with a good battery. What I really don't like about the MBP is that they don't have a Ethernet port

One thing that stood out to me was that it has double the maximum memory capacity and the CPU seems a little faster. Just wanted to get some more knowledgeable eyes to double-check it and give me their opinion.

I would like a dedicated graphics card, and an SSD. And good battery life when note taking or internet surfing. I do have a dedicated Gaming PC so i don't need top of the line graphics, just enough to make modeling software appear nice and smooth when i'm working.

From what I can tell the W series have better processors, and smart card readers (I am in national guard so a smartcard reader would be handy).

The Y series have better graphics cards

Is there any difference I am not seeing? Different screens? different speakers? Better peripheral hookups? They both have FHD 1920x1080 screens but some are anti-glare and others are FHD LED Glare Wedge

Just got this and thought the community would appreciate some comments about it. I'll keep it simple: 

**Windows 8**

Good:

* Once you get used to the new start menu tile interface

* People have been commenting about unwanted ads in their tiles. This is hype. They are just some default programs that are a little annoying and can be easily removed. 

Bad:

*  The interface is weird. It seems like they took Windows 7 and said ""Hey we want to do this tile thing

* Performance. If they were actually good programmers, but I still need extra RAM because Windows said so.

Overall: Except the start menu

**Screen**

* The touch interface is extremely accurate. I'll probably still get a stylus

* The screen is full 1080P

**Performance**

* CPU power:

For work purposes

* Graphics

Rendering is way different than running code, duh)

Kerbal space program also runs great.

**Physical**

It's 0.8 inches thick. Looks like a macbook. I was very impressed by the physical design and layout.

Fan runs great

Lacks a numpad :(

Advertised 5 hour battery life is actually dead-on. (Unless you're trying to run Far Cry 3)

No DVD drive. But I never use those anyway.

The screen completely unfolds to lay flat

**Overall**

It cost $1400 because of the touch screen. If I wasn't a fucking lunatic I would have skipped the touch screen and got more power. If you want to move into a touch screen world but still want a keyboard,False,,t5_2s4k5,1357362380.0,,,t3_15zj2c

Okay so, but there are a few items on here that I'm not too sure about, so I was hoping some of you guys could shed some light on some of these items.

* So the standard processor is the i7-3610QM @ 2.3GHz. However, while that is a lot of money, it is something I could technically afford.

* The hard drive that comes with this is a 1 TB 5400RPM. However

* 32 GB Hard Drive Accelerator Cache for $50. I don't really know how good this is. Apparently though, giving me the error ""32GB mSSD Hard Drive Acceleration Cache requires purchase of non-Solid State or Hybrid Hard Drive."" Apparently the 7200RPM drive is a hybrid?

* The standard display is 1366x768, so I'm wondering if anyone has any opinions to cement my decision.

* There doesn't seem to be an option to upgrade the processor's thermal paste on the official store. If heat is going to be an issue, is it easy for me to do myself? Or should I not worry about it?

* There's a Cooling Mat here for $40. I'm sure I could find another one for $20 elsewhere. Is there any reason why I would get the $40 one?

Hi all. This is my second try here. Per your advice several months ago

I'll be using it mainly for **grad school** (statistical software + a bit of programming, GTA4, Mass Effect, Medieval Total War II -- i.e., nothing *too* graphics intensive). 

Key features I'm interested in: 

- I'd like **more than 6.5 hours** of battery life.
-  Something that weighs less than **5 lbs**. I want something easy to carry! (15.6"" is the biggest I'd go. However
- At least **8 GB of RAM**.
- Pretty standard these days
- I prefer **Windows**.
- 1440 x 900 resolution or better. 1366 x 768 is unacceptable. Ideally
- I don't need an optical drive and I don't particularly care about speakers.
- I would prefer an established brand, Acer, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba). Open to other suggestions, though. 


Finally, but at the same time, I probably won't be able to flat-out replace my computer-to-be if something happens to it. That said, these plans can add $200-$300 on to up-front costs. Do you guys normally go for it?

Budget: Infinite 
Screen-size: Doesn't Matter as long as it's 1600x900 or Full HD

This is probably a really common question

Mildly Portable
-------------------
I need a laptop that I can carry to college almost every single day, please keep it practical if not fully convenient. A high battery life is must, around 4 to 5 hours of medium usage e.g.-surfing the web on min. brightness.

Extreme Gaming
-------------------
FOR ONCE I just want a laptop that's not going to compromise the GPU and CPU for mobility. The CPU should preferably be a quad-core, lag should be NON-EXISTENCE from anything on the native resolution of 1920x1080 and anything from 2011 and before should play on Ultra. Sure, Crysis 3 or Witcher 2 I might need to lower the settings down a notch, but I still need playable FPS for such demanding games for at least a year after my purchase. Nvidia or AMD, doesn't really matter, but I strongly implore nothing lower Nvidia the GeForce GTX 650 series and for AMD the Radeon HD 7970, as the tests show even these present some unfortunate FPS reductions for demanding games. Keep in mind that gaming is it's primary function.

Other Desirable Features

Reliable and Durable: I don't want to contact customer support or change any parts at all for the first year at least... fine
Heating Issues: Never above 90F. Okay, touch-pad or palm rest.
Design and build quality: I want it to look half-decent and presentable

So to sum up -Insanely powerful graphics card
-Possible to carry around without too much trouble 
-Above average battery life 
-Doesn't burn my hands 
-I can trust the screen won't crack I close it too fast like my last hp garbage. 
-Looks ""meh"" 7/10

I bought my laptop from Newegg. Originally

So

Note: I do not have any benchmarks or exact battery live numbers.

EDIT: So I just thought I would go ahead and post the things that I have noticed about the laptop.

* It has a pretty hard edge

* Top gets fingerprints

* Trackpad sucks

* Keyboard is fine for the most part

* Speakers are phenomenal for a laptop.
 
* I've been playing GTA IV, and Trials Evolution. All seem to run great.
 
* Graphics takes a huge performance hit when playing on battery

* Trackpad sucks.

* Display is great coming from a 14"" 1366 x 768 screen.

* Windows 8 is bearable with StartIsBack

* Did I mention the trackpad?

EDIT2: Thought I should mention a couple of things regarding the SLI.

So the battery life with SLI is good for about 4 hours. You cannot switch to integrated graphics while the Ultrabay card is physically in the machine. You have to manually pull it out and only then it allows you to use integrated graphics. It lets you disable SLI without pulling out the card but it doesn't let you switch t integrated.

So I'm earning enough money this summer to finally be able to afford a good laptop for school. My old one (HP dv5) is still in great condition, and I now have different needs (more programming/graphics work as opposed to internet/word processing). Also, the graphics card on this one doesn't support virtualization, so I can't run VMs, which is disappointing because I wanted to play with some different Linux distributions.

The 482PG is the 14"" model. There is the 582PG (15.6""), can be had for the same price with the same specs (besides weight and size, I guess). My configuration has the i7 4500U (1.8GHz), 8GB RAM, GT750m 4GB, 1080P IPS Touchscreen monitor, 1TB (WD Blue, Win 8.

1. The **screen** is quite nice. Viewing angles are good from all directions, Chrome, Slimdrivers, etc). I think this is an issue with Windows 8.
2. The **keyboard** took some getting used to for me, and the keys are responsive. So pretty good overall.
3. On the other hand, with those integrated style buttons that just feel wrong and often move the cursor just as you're clicking. Almost makes me want to use the touchscreen more (I would, if I didn't have a mouse).
4. **Build quality** wise, it is pretty sturdy. It's a sleek looking machine, although if you're looking for a unique look, this is not the laptop for you (probably shouldn't be buying an Acer anyway...). The bottom and screen edges are rubberized, so it's not all slippery aluminum or something. It's heavy for an ultrabook, but still pretty slim and light in my books. The lack of an optical drive doesn't make that much of a difference. The ports, which are mostly located in the back (only 2 USB 2.0, and an SD reader on the sides), which involves removing at least 10 screws; there is no ""easy access"" hatch. 
5. In terms of **performance**, though that's kind of a given. I played Guild Wars 2, and ended up having to lower the resolution to 1600x900 because it just couldn't handle it well at 1080p, even with all the settings at lowest (besides subsambling, which is essentially lowering the resolution). The fps would be in the 20s usually, which is kind of playable, but not really acceptable for me, I have most settings on medium, I wish I could put the full HD to use.

Well, so I can use it and test it myself).

G46VW- 

PROS: Small (14""), cheaper (by about $200), decent battery life, personal like of the keyboard, good cooling (for a laptop, huge plus), single GPU (which will probably get overclocked because of the cooling)

CONS: Small (14""), screen is dim, only a 768p screen, no keypad, part of me dislikes the design.



Y500

PROS: i7 2.4GHz, 1080p screen, gloss finish, better graphics card performance, better interior design (keyboard and such), better sound (supposedly), better card reader

CONS: Heat issues (gets uncomfortable to the user to game, heat from the SLIed card blows out toward the right hand (my mouse hand), MICROSTUTTERS FROM THE SLI (cannot stand microstutter), awful touchpad (not that big of a deal), NO OPTIMUS (horrid battery life).

Right now I'm leaning towards the Y500 because it's more powerful overall, and 1080p. However, if what people say about the microstutter from the SLI is true, I'll dump it in a heartbeat. Same somewhat applies to the heating issue, though that can get fixed/can be avoided (not the getting hot air tossed at my hand part.

1. 1235$ - [The new CyberPower Fangbook X7-100](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/cyberpower-fangbook-x7-100-gtx-675mx-i7-1080p-windows-deal/) - a 17.3"" gaming laptop packing a lot of features: I7-3630QM, 7200RPM 750GB HDD, 1080p screen and Windows OS for 1235$ and you also get a 150$ in-game value gift for several games. Quite a deal and probably the most interesting for a 17.3"" in this price range currently due to the high GTX 675MX performance (+270$ for GTX 680M) and the fact that it comes with a Windows OS.

2. 900$-1025$: [Still the Lenovo Y500 with dual GT 650M GPUs with an I7 and 8GB DDR3 for 1025$](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/lenovo-ideapad-y500-dual-gt-650m-i7-1080p-deal/) or [with an I5 and 6GB DDR3 for 900$](http://www.gaminglaptopsjunky.com/lenovo-ideapad-y500-15-6-gaming-laptop-dual-gt-650m-gddr5-i5-3230m-6gb-ddr3-nice-1080p-display-1tb-hdd-for-900/). A lot of gaming power for the price. The SLI configuration provides something like a GTX 670MX + a little more and you also get a nice 1080p screen (buy glossy)

3. 750$: [The Dell Inspiron 15R SE with 1080p screen, although personally the Asus N56DP is more attractive due to the fact it's cool and quiet (but has an AMD A10 and not an I7)

4. [Acer M5-481TG with GT 640M GDDR5 and I5-3317U

As the title suggests

I'm looking for either a laptop or an ultrabook, and i highly prefer a 16:10 aspect ratio, although i won't look down on 16:9. 

My price range, but anything under budget is definitely a priority. 

As for my main uses, as i'll probably be running steam for linux on it. I won't go into much detail about how much performance i want out of it since its still hard to gauge exactly how each game performs on different PCs, but anything that will net a playable framerate in games like Torchlight 2 and TF2 should be good enough for me. 

Battery life is really important. I travel a lot

Weight really isn't an issue, like i mentioned above i travel a lot, and want something that wouldn't fall apart during a bit of rough travel. I do listen to a lot of music, so decent audio is a plus (but i won't pay a premium for things like Beats audio) 

##In case you all were intimidated by this wall of text i'll give the rundown in TL;DR format

**Price Range:** $700-$800 US

**Ideal Resolution:** 1440x900 and above ***ABSOLUTELY NO 1366x768*** If netbooks are my only option then i'll take 1280x800

**Main Uses:** web browsing

**Battery Life:** 5+ hours is ideal

**Durability/Portability/Size:** weight and size aren't all that important to me

**Operating System:** No preference really,False,,t5_2s4k5,False,,,t3_18dufw
1360673829.0,18di6w,"[PL] Need a gaming laptop/desktop replacement. Budget of up to 1800$, the lower the better. Got a candidate, need comments and answers to general questions. Please help!",Kodix,7,10, trying to find a gaming laptop at a reasonable price. My goal is to allow the laptop to play any games coming out in the next 2 years or so comfortably. 

Sorry for not using the questionnaire - I consider most components I did not mention (specifics of laptop build, etc) of neglible importance. The laptop is essentially meant as a desktop replacement - I'd build a proper PC if I didn't need to travel a fair bit. I prefer 15,6"" screens - large enough to use normally, small enough to travel with comfortably.

I've come up with the following customized laptop:

CLEVO P150EM:

Processor: Intel Core i7-3630QM 2.4 - 3.4GHz Turbo, 22nm, 45W

RAM: 8 GB (2 x 4) KINGSTON HyperX 1600 MHz DDR3 CL9   

Main hard drive: 120 GB SSD KINGSTON HyperX 3K (555 / 510 MB/s)   

MSATA SSD Drive: none

Graphics card: AMD Radeon HD 7970M 2.0GB GDDR5 **OR** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675MX. Need help with this one. More below.

CD Drive: a HDD slot instead

The entirety of this would cost me 1779$ - which is already a bit above my alloted budget

&amp;nbsp;

Next

* Do you know of any better deals than that? From a short look

* **Graphics Card**: How indicative are benchmarks of actual usability? On futuremark, in the [computer games FPS table](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Computer-Games-on-Laptop-Graphic-Cards.13849.0.html), the Geforce seems to perform notably better than the Radeon. When looking at benchmarks on [Notebookcheck](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Graphics-Cards-Benchmark-List.844.0.html), I notice that the Geforce does better than the Radeon in old benchmarks, but gets outclassed in the newer ones. How to interpret this? Does this mean that the Radeon is likely to have better performance in new, upcoming games?

* Do you think that's enough RAM? I have the option to get 16 or 32 gb

* This is my first time getting an SSD as a main hard drive (or at all). I happen to have purchased an external 2 TB hard drive recently

* The MSATA SSD slot seems to have more expensive and far inferior drives to the main hard drive versions


* What about temperature? Basically - is the laptop likely to run at decent temperatures regardless of which parts from the customization options I choose, I'll have overheating trouble.


* While I'm at it, the problems I have with the current laptop: Power Adapter jack is nearly broken and has constant connectivity issues, the battery has lost half of its max charge and only charges up to 50% now, the usb ports also have connectivity problems, and there's some deeper hardware problems going on as well).

RAM - I've heard and understand too much ram is unnecessary, but I'm no gamer.  I won't be using this for games, mainly for browsing and media like Netflix, also some photoshop and after effects.  So, how much ram would be enough?  4? 6? Would 8 be an unnecessary price to pay?

Processor - i3, etc.  Is it worth upgrading for quadcore/i7, or is that simply a luxury that isn't necessary?  My friend built his own desktop w. an i5 and it runs very fast, so that should be enough for a non-gamer especially like me, yes?  Also, GHz, how overrated is it?  Is a quadcore i7 at 1.9ghz w.

Okay, unique I guess, I think that I can deal with that - but then it turns out the cdrom is a very noisy slot loader that resets every time you boot or come out of sleep mode and is annoying as hell. But the real deal killer was the trackpad: Sony has decided to go with a variant of the Macintosh buttonless trackpad, but the way they implemented the right mouse button is to put it a the bottom-right of the pad - so every time you go for it, you move the cursor AWAY from what you're trying to hit.

First, you get an automated email confirming your purchase. In the next days, it's not automated like NCIX but someone from their company will contact you. I contacted them myself by email on a Monday and they told me that the laptop would be made Tuesday and would ship on Wednesday. And it did, and I got my laptop very fast after that.
Overall their website is very nice and the price was the best for me. However I saved a lot of money by buying my ram and SSD separately

  
The laptop :

I paid $849+tax CAD for the basic Fox 4.0 with an Ivy Bridge processor i7-3610qm. Shipping was free.
I think this laptop is basically the Clevo P150em so I will just say that it's a great laptop. You install Windows
Here are the things I don't like about it :  
- The power supply has a block connected in 2 places. One is connected to your pc and the other to the power bar. You plug the powerbar cable into the power supply and this thing is very loose. If you just hold it by the cable it will detach itself. I've memorized this so hopefully there won't be any accidents
- At night
- When you close the laptop for transportation

My upgrades :
Mushkin Chronos 120g - $99  (I opened the case
1x8gig Corsair 1600mhz - $55 (You have to put the ram at 30 degrees to install it

So far:

Pros:

* Increased utility.
* Makes Windows 8 easier (how much? comments on this would be great).
* Potentially a good compromise for someone that also wants a tablet.

Cons:

* Higher price
* Typically increases laptop thickness.
* Fingerprints
* No matte option


Considerations:

* Regular laptop with touch screen

1372347824.0,1h6mqp,Looking to Get a New Computer with Privacy in Mind,,7,2,4,"[Redirected from /r/Privacy]
 I've been thinking about my options for my impending computer purchase.  I am concerned about multiple factors in my purchase.

* Impact of buying a brand new computer (was thinking refurbished for this reason)
* Labor practices of the given computer company (*very* difficult to weigh)
* Free-Software OS (Free as in Freedom)
* Privacy (obviously) [localized data, Tor, etc.] 
* Least bloatware to deal with (upon purchase) [Probably stock with the machine]
* Durability (accesibility for repairs and known to perform in stress tests)

I know to steer clear of Dell, but I am wondering what people here might think of Lenovo, particularly their acquisition of IBM's ThinkPad line.  If I am going to buy a computer I need it to be ready for dual-booting if possible.
With all of that in mind

* Is Linux 12.04

* How easy is it to dual-boot Trisquel or other GNU/Linux/Debian based distros with a proprietary OS while maintaining privacy?  What is the best for privacy?

* Is live-booting and Tails *really* all-around better than an installed non-amnesic OS?

So, without either replacing the 1tb drive it comes with or getting some ultrabay version/adapter? In other words, is there a free mSATA port in the models that don't come with an extra SSD, that I could just put my own drive into?

I'm interested in something that is in the small form factor/high battery life style. Something preferably with an SSD.
I look at the Samsung Chromebook and like it for its portability, and battery life. In all likelihood I would probably tinker with it and throw CrUbuntu on there. 

Then I started thinking if I can do better? Does anyone know if I can find somethin in the 12'-11.6 range with similar body and specs as the Samsung Chromebook? I realize the CPU an ARM in that
suggested models. 

The Lenovo X130e is currently going on Ebay for ~$500

The Samsung Series 9 13.3 is priced way out of the realm. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

1.  How useful is a SSD actually?  I understand that it is faster but is that only when people are playing hardcore and every bit of speed matters?  Or will a casual gamer see the difference?  Also

2.  Are cooling pads really effective on laptops and could someone recommend a good one?

I'd just like to share a couple of thoughts about my recent Lenovo purchase. I did a lot of research and asked a couple of times in this subreddit too

I bought mine from here: http://www.komplett.se/k/ki.aspx?sku=773486

The most interesting/infuriating part of the experience is that I could not find out what SSD I was getting until I got my laptop. There's nothing on the Merchant's site except for size, I asked here and on some other forums - NOTHING! I was expecting a pretty crappy SSD but I bought it anyway because the HDD model was only like $30 cheaper for a 500GB HDD, and storage space is not an issue for me, I'd rather have something small, quiet and fast.

In any case I was very pleasantly surprised to learn that I had a Samsung 830 SSD in my machine! It's not quite the 840

So can anyone tell me why this insanity exists? I would have understood if it was a crappy SSD

Some other random thoughts about the laptop after a day of use. 

It came with both Win7 installed and a Win8 DVD, and a bunch of Lenovo apps that I don't think I need but maybe some people do. Not nearly as bad as the Acer I bought before. At the first boot I was greeted with a very threatening message from Symantec's antivirus program, something along the lines of ""nice machine you have there buddy, would be a real shame if something happened to it!"".

The machine itself is fast and quiet, second gen Intel SSD), maybe even a little faster at some tasks.

It also looks great from a distance

I bought this machine for my wife, but the Intel HD4000 should be able to run some games on very basic settings.

**Tl;Dr : Need new laptop

**My Questions:**

1. Does an SSD come with the OS loaded on it? If so would a 32gb SSD have 32gb and the SSD worth of storage or does the preloaded OS make the SSD only have ~12gb (idk if the OS is actually 20gb) of storage.

2. How do laptops' graphics (cards) work. All &lt;$1000 laptops I have seen do not have graphics cards in which I am familiar with. For non-gaming purposes what is a good graphics processor (I do not know what to call them) for a ~$600 budget?

3. Which brands are considered bad or untrustworthy and why? If customer service or part quality is a problem for a company in such a way that it makes the product not worth buying please let me know.

4. How reliant are laptops on the processor? When looking around at the graphic processors i saw that a certain on (I cannot remember which) said that its performance relied on the processor. Is this true for all if any graphics processors?

Anyhow, 8gb ram, a non-integrated graphics card (I don't want to play Crysis, but I like to be able to play things) and is light (1.87kg). On paper, nothing else I can find comes close, with the possible exception of the £549 Inspiron 15R, which trades weight (2.32kg) and the SSD for a bigger hard drive and a better graphics card, and it turned out to be 2.4kg

As I said, particularly for that weight - and as someone with a bad back, weight is certainly an issue. However, the reviews of the 14Z I've read are decidedly mixed, and Dell seems fairly unpopular here. So are there any better models from other manufacturers that I might be interested in? Or which of the models above would you choose? And perhaps most importantly, are there any expected imminent product refreshes etc I might want to keep an eye on, or that I would regret not waiting for?

A bonus slightly philosophical question: my current laptop, Vista, got free from Uni at the start of 2010) feels like it's coming to the end of its life in that it quite frequently hangs particularly when switching tabs and tasks. Hence the shopping for a new one. That said, in many ways it's still in good working order, and I'm somehow reluctant to replace something that isn't strictly broken - especially as tech keeps improving. So the questions: how much should I put up with before it's reasonable to upgrade? Also, any ideas of what to do with my old laptop when I replace it?

I will be starting business school in August, maybe SPSS. Looking for a portable laptop, ultrabook preferred, with a 13.3"" or 14"" screen size, decent screen, and 6-7 hour battery life (if ultrabook). I'll be using Excel a lot so I prefer a high screen resolution. Also would prefer light weight. I am open to buying something like a Lenovo T430 but only because I can buy a 9 cell battery. I purchased a really good Groupon deal for a ASUS UX31A ultrabook earlier this week but Groupon failed me hard so I won't be getting it. 

Question: is it worth it to wait until Haswell ultrabooks are released? Timing will be sensitive since I need my laptop by July and Haswell is supposed to debut around June.

So I am in grad school and I do computational work which I program and debug locally and then send it off to be crunched on the mainframe. Then pull down the output and do post-processing using python normally.

Right now I program on desktops but would like to go get lost in the stacks away from distraction
Originally I limited myself to gaming laptops because I would like to also play around with CUDA thus I was thinking about the [Lenovo Y500 59360241]( http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:item.detail?GroupID=457&amp;Code=59360241&amp;category_id=5B0116E237099FA0FCA012D9B20ED2FB)


But then I was thinking that portable would be more useful and having a touch screen for making up PDF’s would be even better so I started looking at Ultrabooks that have touch screens and that are of some size. I must admit that on this front I have looked considerably less

1.	Is there a touch screen ultrabook with a CUDA compatible GPU?

-	I found the following [from NVIDIA]( http://blogs.nvidia.com/2012/03/real-ultrabooks-have-gpus/)

-	[From Dell](http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-15z-5523/pd) but the touch doesn’t fold back so u can use it like a tablet.

2.	I also looked at the following ultrabooks:

-	[IdeaPad Yoga 13]( http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=1A4B81C8AC677A5FB11849005C1752B5)

-	[ASUS TAICHI™ 21](http://incredibletogether.asus.com/taichi21.html)

-	[Acer Aspire S7]( http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model-datasheet/NX.M3EAA.006)


Lastly I also like using two screens when working and would like to get a second protable usb screen such as the [GeChic On-Lap]( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0V10H35673) or the [AOC E1649FWU](http://www.amazon.com/AOC-E1649FWU-USB-Powered-Portable-Monitor/dp/B005SEZR0G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362415356&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=GeChic). Any thoughts on these USB powered second screens would be welcome.

1361895300.0,199jdm,Need to buy affordable laptop for long hospital stays,Hamburglary,7,1,0,"Hi everyone!

I used to have an HP laptop, I end up in the hospital for extended periods of time (cancer sucks) and being without a laptop is awful. I'm trying to work on getting into law schools, and completing applications with no computer access is very difficult. I'd also like to be able to watch Netflix in the hospital, access the internet, etc. For now, I just use my cell phone. 

I'm looking to buy something affordable as my medical bills really stretch me for cash. I'm looking at a few on Amazon right now that are under $400. I don't need to do anything that would be super difficult for a basic computer to handle. I've also looked at the Chromebooks but I don't know how I feel about them yet. 

If you have any suggestions

I'm on the fence between a relatively modern netbook(assuming a lot of the failures with the 1st gens have been rectified) and the possibility of a Chromebook.  I usually have to do a clean install on her netbook atleast once a year due to viruses, how a majority of Apps work without a touch screen, and what kind of future support the current ARM models with have.

A refurbished or used netbook would be familiar, but I've never been a laptop guy, especially if I'm looking at older models included. A tablet/netbook hybrid would be great and I've looked at the Fujitsu LifeBook's but I get the feeling those things are fragile. She has little hands; no problems with the Lillipution layout of the Eee, but the trackpad definitely makes her cuss.

List any features that are critical: (e.g. Optical drive, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, etc.): to be honest I do not know the difference btw USB 2.0 and 3.0. Higher the better? But I'd like to have as many built in USB port as possible ~4. Either VGA or hdmi

* a small form

* a very nice touchscreen for taking notes (like the Pro's digitizer). 

* a DECENT ability to play games - basically I'm fine if I can play most modern PC games, ~40fps at, say 1366x768, is a must. I know this is difficult to assure though.

* full Windows 8. Preferably bundled.

* at least 1 USB 3.0 port. Preferably Bluetooth as well. 

* Video out. (HDMI / DVI / MDP)

Things not a huge factor for me: 

* Weight. Nothing this smallish will probably be too heavy to bother me. 

* Storage. Most of what I need is in the cloud

* Battery life. 4-5hrs for note-taking and web-browsing is fine. Gaming I'll do with it plugged in.

* Country of purchase: United States

* Budget range: It's flexible since I'm more concerned with quality than price

* Purpose (netbook, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): I want something fairly lightweight that's easy to carry around. I'll be using it mostly for coding (web dev, stuff for school, and some graphics, but nothing involved that would warrant special hardware). Secondary uses will just be the typical movies, etc. More or less general purpose

* Screen size preference: I want something small that still has normal-sized keys. I don't want a dedicated numpad

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): I don't care what comes on it, if the seller/manufacturer offers an OS refund that'd be a plus.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Pretty much none. I may play some games on it, Portal, maybe finally get around to playing Halflife, etc.).

* Performance requirements (video, but I need to be able to use at least 8gb of RAM since I'll be running VMs and would like to be able to give them a decent amount (of RAM). I don't care how much it comes with since I can easily add my own. That's another requirement - easily upgradeable is a major plus.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, and whatever else)

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Not particularly. I care a lot more about component and build quality and that it meets my other criteria than I do about appearance.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer?** (Choose one

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: I think a balance here would be good. I want decent battery life

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Definitely the quality side, if you really, really think that spending 875 would get me something significantly closer to my ideal then don't hesitate to suggest it. If it's just something like ""This one's $950 but the USB ports are on the LEFT side!"" then you can let that pass.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: I'll probably have this on my lap enough that low noise/heat would be more valuable.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: Yes

* A great keyboard: I'm not exactly sure what would make a laptop keyboard extremely good versus just okay

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: I say this below

* Great audio: This could mean two things. First, I do love music (I mostly listen to electro-house, DnB, and dubstep if that's relevant, though I doubt it is.), so I'd prefer that the potential sound quality not be terrible. I don't need anything like a nice dedicated sound card, or even really anything above average. I just don't want this to be the thing that gets completely chopped to accomodate everything else.

* *subsection tl;dr - The ranking is: screen, keyboard*

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, etc.)

(no particular order)

* I don't need an optical drive of any kind. If i have a situation where I just really have to have one I'll get a USB external.
* A not-tiny trackpad. It doesn't have to be especially big
* Mouse buttons that don't require a lot of pressure.
* HDMI out
* USB 3.0 ports. I'd like two or more. One USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 might be okay if the rest of the package made it worth it.
* Comfortable to type on. I had a laptop years ago that had somewhat sharp edges
* Preferably SSD. I don't need a terabyte hard drive in it. Something at about 256gb would be plenty. I could go for 128 as well if it made a decent price difference
* An ethernet port would also be nice

Oh, but right now a laptop fits my needs better.

**Additional Section**

I've done some looking on my own using the sidebar links. Of what I've seen, does anyone know a vendor that sells the Clevo models listed? I couldn't find one.)

* Clevo w130ew

* Clevo w130ev

* Asus Zenbook ux31a

* Clevo w110ew

* Sony VAIO S Series (SVS13122CXW)
