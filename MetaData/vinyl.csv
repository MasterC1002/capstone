That's all really. Not looking for sympathy or anything... just wanted to share my story with the only vinyl community I am apart of. I thought ya'll would be proud of me. :)


EDIT: The reasoning boils down to sentiment. Nearly all of my records have sentimental value for various reasons.



EDIT: THE STORY

. The fire started in bastrop

Sunday evening. Helpless, hopped on his bike, rode out of the neighborhood and down the highway back to his car. My dog was with me in san an, thankfully. Police were driving around with their loudspeakers evacuating everyone. He goes and stays at a friend's house.

Cut to sunday morning. I'm feeling wretched. If I don't try to get back, it looked like armageddon. seriously just fucking crazy. I'll post pictures here after this, if anyone is interested. Anyways, the highway was closed at the hospital as I had suspected. I parked at the hospital and hopped on my bike. 

About 10 to 15 minutes later, camelbak, backpack, camera bag. It was incredibly awkward. Bastrop is in the hill country, so my neighborhood street looks like a roller coaster. By the time I made it to the front entrance of my neighborhood I laid down my bike and unloaded my shoulders. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack with all the adrenaline, the up and down ride with the weight on my shoulders. It took me about 20 minutes to catch my breath. I loaded up again and rode to my car down the highway. I was filmed by a lot of bystanders riding out of my neighborhood with all the stuff on my shoulders. I emptied the bags into my car (which was park in the shade and not too hot). I loaded the empty bags up and hit the forest again. Repeat that whole adventure once more. I figured that would be it for me, and I didn't think that the fire would actually make it to our house.  Then my phone died. Not wanting to move my car, and picked up a mobile charger. Rode back to my car and charged up. Bystanders were just stopped on the highway and hundreds of people were just helplessly watching in horror and shock.  By this time, caught my breath and then rode to my office to see if it was on fire as smoke was coming from that direction . It was fine so I went in

The next day

My favorites for cost/quality are the [resealable 3 mil outer sleeve](http://www.sleevecityusa.com/resealable-3-mil-outer-lp-sleeves-pack-of-50-p/9222.htm) and some [Disckeeper inners](http://www.sleevecityusa.com/Diskeeper-2-0-Antistatic-Record-Sleeves-p/9235.htm). Another great option from Amazon that has Prime shipping are [these 3 mil outers](http://www.amazon.com/INDUSTRY-STANDARD-Plastic-Sleeves-12SE03/dp/B000RA7IZS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375060617&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=record+sleeve) (nonresealable, but cheaper than Sleeve City). I don't buy anything less than disckeepers for my inners if I value the record. 80's hair metal can get the paper sleeves though. Whatever you do, don't skimp on your outer sleeves, cheap ones can split easily, and just don't feel as good as nicer ones.

1350400595.0,11kn0j,"Using PhotoShop to make informed vinyl purchases online (eBay, etc...)",REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,348,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/11kn0j/using_photoshop_to_make_informed_vinyl_purchases/, as many sellers who have any kind of issue with a buyer, a long history of positive ratings is a strong indicator

[**Here's an eBay listing for a typical copy of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/zctY2.png)  
There are multiple photographs of the record for sale, and that often reveals a good amount of detail concerning condition. The larger the original photo, the better. This isn't the case here, but the photos offer information.  

The problem (mainly for buyers, the shine (""luster,"" ""gloss,"" whatever you want to call it) of a record - which often remains a characteristic of the vinyl regardless of surface marks, unless the record is very, very worn - can be misleading as to its true condition. A camera's automatic exposure factors mostly in the highlights, and a lot of information remains buried in the shadows. So how can you see what's really going on in a seller's photos? Ps offers a lot of options.  

One of the easiest ways is a simple levels adjustment. If you drag a photo in Ps

[**Here is one of the detail shots from the listing dragged in to Ps

Those circled triangles at the bottom are called sliders, you can adjust these levels and uncover details that are obscured by darkness, shadow.  

[**Here's the same image with the black and gray levels adjusted&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/2UvsF.png)  

You can see much more of the surface and what imperfections exist

I do this all the time. Here's an actual record I bought from an eBay seller not too long ago.  

*Bird and Diz*

[**Before PhotoShop&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/69yuR.jpg)  

[**After a quick levels adjustment&gt;**](http://i.imgur.com/UvbUN.jpg)  

Pretty dramatic difference. I questioned the seller about the condition of the record, but I ended up winning the auction for $30. Upon receiving the record, it was obviously a low ""Good"" condition (being generous) – that huge mark on it is this strange webbed streak, like the baked earth of a desert floor. It plays with a ton of noise, but it's a cool record anyway. (The seller was actually nice enough to refund my money and let me keep the record, being as trashed as it is.) Anyway...

Some major problems I see all too often on [/r/vinyl](/r/vinyl):

1. Your speakers are way too close together.  You've got no soundstage.
1. Your speakers are right up against the walls, but also heavily affects the bass.
1. Your speakers are right next to the turntable. The vibrations will heavily distort the music.

Go read [this guide to speaker placement](http://www.gcaudio.com/resources/howtos/speakerplacement.html) and look at some of the [diagrams here](http://www.dolby.com/us/en/consumer/setup/connection-guide/home-theater-speaker-guide/index.html).  (The second one is more for ""home theater"" setups

You are not getting the most out of what you have.  You'll be surprised how much *better* things sound if you follow some of these tips.  You don't need to measure everything out obsessively

1. Move your speakers apart.  A rough guide is they should be about as far away from each other as the distance from you to them.
1. Keep your speakers away from the walls
1. Speakers should be approximately ear level.

I really hope this info helps some of you.

EDIT:  Since this made the sidebar (thanks better_information!)

We talked with him for a long while about how we're getting married and our plans for our music situation, and some pretty funny ones (Poison Love, Another One Bites The Dust, etc). We also talked with several people about how temperamental jukeboxes can be, so we may change our minds and stick with a regular turntable. Eventually, we did find some great picks. When we got around to paying him, the man said, you're getting married, ""I hope you two have a wonderful life."" 

I suppose that's our first wedding present

I’m fortunate enough that my local store handles Record Store Day pretty much perfectly
To give a quick rundown of how Record Store Day SHOULD be done based on how my local store does it:

• People form an orderly line outside the shop before it opens, modelling clay, bubble blowers, newspapers/magazines and other entertainments outside the store to keep those in line entertained. Some promo guys hand out free bacon sandwiches, a Brazillian TV station has showed up and someone else is making a documentary about the whole thing.

• The staff come out before opening and give everyone a numbered ticket so they and you know exactly what number in the queue you are. They also hand out up-to-date lists of exactly what they have and what things cost. They also give goodie bags full of vinyl, Badges, Balloons, Posters etc. To the first 50 or so people in line (the people right at the front get more/better goodie bags)

• At 7am the store opens but the tills don’t, tells the staff what they want to buy (or hands over their highlighted list) – none of the records are on the shelves but are on visible display on every wall with the rest of the stock behind the counter. You hand over your list and they create a pile of what you want.

• At 8am the tills open and they ring up the first 20 or so people who got their stacks ready

• No pre-orders

• As things are allocated and sell out the staff announce to the line what has gone and take the final copy from the display wall - this part is a bit unpleasant if you’re just praying the people in front don’t buy things you want (I was so sad to miss out on the Hold Steady 7” and the Black Keys/Stooges split)

• In the afternoon there’s a party, signed records, gift vouchers etc. – this year they had a signed Postal Service vinyl box set, a Parquet Courts test pressing, art prints and tons of other things. About a third of the people there won something.

• After that there’s an in-store performance by a band who then sell their RSD release and sign copies (This year it was Tom Odell who recorded a bunch of covers for an EP


My local store has operated this system the last 4 years and because of it they get massive queues of people who travel huge distances to participate (they also get a LOT of stock in

I was a radio announcer for 13 years

Yet, most iterations (local files, streamed, compressed, lossless, run through DAC into headphones, and audiophile room-filling power juggernauts), and there are many examples of crap recording and worse delivery.

But the difference that means the most to me isn’t some ‘warm sound’ phenomenon

The difference to me is in how the songs are presented. The order of presentation. Vinyl has only one setting; play. I can’t remember if there was much bother way back when, to lift the needle could be a risky thing in company. It all depended on the people, the song, the level of intoxicants in the bloodstream, etc. Usually it would go by, a maximum 6 minute commitment. There are exceptions of course, but if you’re listening to In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida

Now, Zero 7, Winehouse or even Coltrane.

Whereas now, one that meets my standards. Anything even slightly less has me impatient for a greater level of quality.

All the tunes in rotation on my playlists meet those standards

The last vestige of this was a game I used to play late night after the bars with people who were musically motivated. It happened naturally. You select a cut to demonstrate some impression

“Great sound! Who does that with a Guitar? How can he do that? Here’s where that melody came from. Remember this?” The possibilities were endless and mostly educational. Those evenings could go on for a long time. Collective playlists – they can’t happen with pockets full of iPod.

So, I’m alone at the turntable. There is no one else who is even comfortable using the equipment.

So I have decided to find a couple of cheap turntables

That’s all I’ve got.

so I didn't think much of it when he was admitted to the nursing home earlier this year, because my aunts and uncles live in smaller homes.
Over the summer we slowly moved the records from my grandpas old house to our own. It took around four trips. He lived 8 hours away

Apparently, when he was a kid, records literally littered the house, stacked utop each other in the basement, kitchen, dining room... hell he even had an entire room that had nothing in it but boxes of records sitting on the ground. As far as organizing them, we were on our own. we got shelving out the wazoo. like, but this was just an overload. 

you could probably make a living by taking a couple of my grandpas vinyls
And thats why I picked today to share this with you folks

and here is the excel file


so as you might have guessed, what do you think? what should we do to improve our listening experience? what should we do to learn? What should we know? let me know.

I should probably also note that my grandpa was a crazed Frank Sinatra fan. Apparently he boasted to owning every single album/single ever released by him ever. which

1330170120.0,q5d7v,Inspecting used vinyl: What to look for.,IHeartThe80s,191,19,43,"I’ve found you can get great LP’s on a budget if you’re meticulous about inspecting them. Here’s how I go about it. 

**Pull LP’s without inspecting them.** Flip and pull

If there are multiple copies of a title you want

**Set up shop.** Look up and find the brightest, look for a quiet part of the store and do your inspection there. If you’re at a swap or yard sale, plop down on the ground crosslegged with your stack in front of you. Relax, this will take a few minutes. 

**Unsleeve the record.** Pay attention to orientation and condition of the innersleeve. If the mouth of the innersleeve is facing out, both by owners and shoppers). If the mouth is up, “locking” the record in the sleeve, that’s better, suggesting the last owner was conscientious. If there are no seam rips on the innersleeve in the common 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions, which is great. If the innersleeve clings to the record slightly as you pull it out

If there is no innersleeve

**First impressions.** Even before you look for scratches, kind of like “space tape” laser-etched foil? If so, this is very promising, and could mean a M- album. (A worn album will look flat, “dead,” or greyish.) Even better is to see a record with tiny paper “hairs” clinging to it, by-products of manufacturing the innersleeve. These are only present the first few times a record’s removed from a sleeve and are soon dusted off or blown away. This is rare, woo-hoo!

**Dirty records.** The first thing you’ll usually see before scratches is dust or dirt clinging to the record. Assuming you have a good cleaner such as a Spin Clean or VPI, where grit has rubbed against the same small area, creating nasty squiggles. If in doubt about whether a record can be cleaned, put a few drops of water from your water bottle onto a fingertip and rub the record, drying it with the hem of your shirt. (Some desperate souls might use saliva, but not me. Hardly ever.)

**Gimme a disc with hair.** Sometimes what appear to be scratches can be hairs, and they'll price it cheaply. 

**Look for scratches.** The nasty, and all scratches will become blindingly apparent. In ambient lighting conditions (most common), just keep shifting the record’s orientation until you see some scratches. (Redditor e-cow suggests using a mini Maglite flashlight at a 45-degree angle to highlight worn groove surfaces; light from directly above can tend to illuminate the untouched groove bottoms rather than the angled play surfaces.) 

Keep a cynical frame of mind; I always tend to think

**Check the edges.** Since that's where the stylus hits first, and check the perimeter carefully. Too often do I put the needle on what I thought was a ""perfect"" copy to hear some confounded clicking. 

**Touch me, your stylus may not either. (It may take a few trials to calibrate your fingertip vs. stylus sensitivity, though.)

**Crossing the rubicon.** Does a scratch cross the banding between tracks? This is helpful. Does the scratch actually cut into the dead wax

**Scratches that skip.** By far the worst scratches are the ones that run diagonally

**Scratches or scuffs?** Not all marks on records are audible (in everyday listening on average equipment). If you see a mark that’s wider than the point of a pin

I’m always happy to find scuffed records in the cheapo bins

**When to be a bitch about scratches.** Know your music. Music with sustained tones or quiet dynamics, or classical, will sound terrible with even minor scratches in them, so be picky. Conversely, the volume and percussion of a loud rock or funk album will mask the scratches better. Also, consider the album side duration. Longer sides over 22 minutes (such as K-Tel compilations) will be microgrooved and cut pretty shallow, so almost any visible scratch will be audible. Conversely, especially those from the 1960’s

**Look for warps.** I should do this with every record I buy, so check ‘em out if they do. To inspect, hold the record at eye level and look laterally across the surface, from the near edge to the spindle hole. If the far edge “waves” above or below the surface, you’ve probably got a warp. Rotate the record 90° and try again. (Note that some very thin vinyl pressings, such as RCA Dynaflex from the 1970’s, will droop a bit while being inspected

**Check for heat damage.** Some records that have been exposed to heat will exhibit damage, so be vigilant. 

**If possible, bring your portable, battery-operated turntable or consider buying one. Don’t forget the headphones! If you’re in a good used record store, they’ll have listening stations with turntables for you to use, so definitely take advantage. Note problematic areas—“end of track 2 and middle of track 5”—and listen to those in particular. Always listen to every record you’re considering buying. Some that look scratch-free may have still been played to death. 

**About covers.** Cover grading is its own art and one I tend to ignore; as long as there’s a jacket I’m happy. Be aware that torn or split jackets can be nicely repaired with acid-free tape. I wouldn’t do this with any high-value records

**Throw the bad ones back.** It can be heartbreaking to put a beloved album that’s not up to snuff back in the bins,” and then bid the title adieu: “We’ll meet again, my friend, on some other day.”

I’m aiming to connect this record with people who will enjoy it. I consider my band to be a punk band (ethically for sure), metal, instrumental and psychedelic rock. Emphasis is on songwriting for sure. The songs are melodic. Many of the tracks are reverb-heavy. I wouldn't quite call it lo-fi, but it’s in the homemade neighborhood. I think it is fucking rad. Guitar, bass, drums, vocals.  
  
Side A is a concept album about the Mexican-American War. Side B contains 6 singles from various recording sessions. 12 songs total, but I’d like your first listening experience to be with your record player, so I’m not going to mention the band’s name in this thread. We live in various cities in Colorado.  
  
If this sounds like something you’re likely to enjoy
  
1. You will listen to it at least 2 times beginning to end.  
  
2. You will play it loud.  
  
I’ll send free copies to at least the first 20 replies, but if you’re international and want one, please PM me and I can send you my PayPal info and we can work out the shipping costs. I definitely want to connect with international people.

More importantly, but if you want speakers and a turntable and an amp that sounds cool but you only have the money from that recently sold Crosley to spend?  You come here.  That's why this is an important thing.  Budget hifi. Here is where you learn that a $40 thrift store Dual is on par with that fancy new budget audiophile deck.  Here is where you figure out that toeing in your speakers some and buying heavy drapes is more important than having a tube preamp. Here's where you learn to get accurate sound on the cheap.  That rules.  The hifi world is so inundated with crazy expensive concept models that it's easy to think that good stereo is about tons of money. This is where you go to learn how to do the best you can with what you've got.  You can afford a Linn-Sondek?  Rad!  Post it!  We'll drool over it.  You can only afford a busted LP60 but have a hundred bucks to get it to sound good?  Rad!  Post it!  We'll help you out (after you check the sidebar).  That's the cool here. That's why this one I check the most often. 

It's important to let people know that music can sound better, I think, is a good gateway to that. Vinyl doesn't, of course, intrinsically sound better than digital sources, but people willing to buy a setup are easily willing to buy a decent setup.  That opens ears.  Good sound, after all, a little bit of accuracy goes a long way towards hitting you in the viscera. And there's something about this medium that makes people gravitate towards that.  That rules. There's something about this medium that makes people listen more actively.  It's probably the ritual/assache of putting the record on, prompts you to listen to it more closely.  But it works.  That's why vinyl sounds better: you have to work a little to listen to it

TL:DR Goat's *World Music* rules, and I'm drunk.

1) **""I dreamed a vampire was climbing in my window so I threw something to stop him and it turned out to be the Crosley.""** (Useful if your room is a story or two up

2) **""I smelled smoke and saw a bright flash and then it just stopped working.""** (Use black spray paint or watercolors to simulate smoke damage. DO NOT set fire to your unit. Rub with burnt charcoal from your BBQ for authentic smell. Press the test button on your room's smoke alarm when parents are present to really sell this one.)

3) **""The platter started spinning faster and faster, dislodge it and place it elsewhere in your room. Squirt ketchup on the edge of the platter and allow to dry for damning evidence.)

4) **""I needed to use it for a science fair project to test parachute technology and it failed.""** (Tie a pillowcase with lengths of string to your Crosley and again

5) **""I donated it to a church/temple/other house of worship so the pastor/rabbi/holy man could play his old records of gospel songs/canting/spiritual uplift.""** (Be radiant with holiness while offering this boldfaced lie. Adhere to yours or your parents' actual religion

6) **""I took it sailing on a friend's boat but we hit the doldrums and had to toss all unnecessary cargo.""** (If they ask

7) **""I tied it on the back of my bike and it fell off at such and such intersection

8) **""It was making weird devil sounds and I didn't want it in the house.""** (Make it clear that the sounds were happening while NOT playing a record

9) **""I sold it to help such and such poor friend pay the rent.""** (Or afford surgery
