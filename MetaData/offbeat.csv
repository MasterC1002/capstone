1293547703.0,esk68,For those of reddit who are socially awkward: How to be socially graceful,johnnyshill,2337,1173,632,"I know it's very arrogant to say I know how to not be socially awkward. But I do. So hear me out! And I'm not gonna just say ""be confident

And there are plenty of different ways that social awkwardness can manifest itself. This post is to address the manifestation that is by far the most common and easily visible

**First:** You aren't as bad at conversing as you think you are. You know how you go to a party, and it isn't because I left and realized all of these great things about America that I was missing. It's because I realized that other countries also suck, in their own ways.

Same with other people. They are all just like you, or grew up not caring, and *don't view this as a negative*. They just view this as what socializing is, and realize this is what everyone is like, and they don't expect other people to always be interesting. In other words, the difference between you and them is not your *ability* to socialize, it's your *perception* of what socializing is. I can't tell you how many times I've hung out with cool people and no one had anything interesting/funny to say. To be honest

So don't be afraid of that. Don't be afraid of conversations, and most of the stories aren't that good. The amount of shit you know from just browsing reddit will allow you to interest people more than most.

**Second:** This one is easy

Don't be instantly reactive to situations - give it a second. So many awkward people I see respond to questions/situations instantly. Something happens, with absolutely no thought, in .01 of a second, you stutter out a response. If some girl asks you ""Hey, is this your drink?"" You instantly look at say, ""Uhh no! Oh wait, yeah it is! Sorry

It's a state of mind. By that I mean, think, and then respond. One. second. Even half a second; all you need. I know it seems like a small amount of time, but *that is why you don't notice it*... But 1 whole second is *100 times* longer to think than the amount of time awkward people take, and it is plenty of time to organize your thoughts, view the situation, and respond normally. Think about the example with the girl asking if it is your drink. You instantly respond, with ""UHH"" and then react, you would see it is your drink, and then give a good response. Just keep your face expressionless while you think

Whenever you go into a social situation, which will be enough), think about any situation for just one second, and then respond.""



**tl;dr:** I'm a big proponent of the idea that often when people say, and can be shown the light. Trust me, you aren't lacking some magical quality that socially graceful people have. You're just doing it wrong. This isn't really a tl;dr, so read what I wrote. 

**EDIT:** Thanks for the upvotes

I want to point out a certain response from lphoenix

&gt;I realize I've seen that pause being taken hundreds and hundreds of times, I'm realizing too that what the person taking a moment is doing physically during that moment is very important. And there are a lot of choices. Making eye contact, looking the person over, giving a slow smile, looking away and back, tilting the head, moving closer or back--you can't just stand there paralyzed in thought, and send whatever message you want to send: flirtation, and creatively responsive

This is what I'm talking about, once you've gotten the pause to become habitual. The stuff he mentions, like tilting the head; you won't have to worry about that, that will simply come out, through your personality, in the pause. That is, once you don't have to think about pausing.

**EDIT #2:** I responded to someone with this

Here's the thing about confidence: Your brain works better when you're confident. Funny things to say just pop into your head, that will just pop into your head also. 

It's the *fear* you have of failing in a conversation that is the problem; it is like throwing a wrench in your brain: it holds back your ability to converse. In other words

The first things in my post should help with confidence once you get that stuff down,False,,t5_2qh11,True,,,t3_esk68

Anonymity encourages trolling behavior. And 4Chan is kind of a heaven for trolls on the Internet. Their users have no identity. Hence

I guess Reddit must work on this issue

I was once a frequent visitor of ATS (abovetopsecert forums)  and I am huge fan of their rules. I am not saying Reddit should implement same strict conversation rules which even penalizes comments using the the acronym 'AFK' instead of Away from the Keyboard. 

But they must have to set new rules where healthy discussion is encouraged and people are 'penalized' for trolling. You can't rely on Moderators alone for this. Since most of them are teenagers too.

2) If you ever find yourself in the situation where you are in trouble with the police

3) At the end of your shower turn the hot water off completely and stay in under the cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. It also helps close your pores and prevent build up of dirt and bacteria.
 
4) Turn it off and then on again. 

5) When you have forgotten someone's name, I mean your last name."" That way you have both of their names and no one is offended. 

6) To peel a boiled egg perfectly: crack the whole thing evenly

7) Pour salt on liquids that are going to stain carpet immediately after they're spilled. Allow to dry for one day then vacuum. Will completely remove the stain. 

8) Peel bananas from the bottom. 

9) Walk on the side of wooden stairs and they don't squeak. Also works with wooden floor boards. Lifting the door handle as you open the door does the same thing. 

10) Wearing socks helps you take off your pants. 

11) Put salt on your coaster and your fucking cup won't stick to it. 

12) When you get brain-freeze, option is to push your tongue really hard against the roof of your mouth. 

13) On most elevators press your floor number and the close door button. It skips all other floors even if the elevator is being called. 

14) If you're writing an article and are not allowed to cite Wikipedia as a source

15) To test if your remote is working

16) Put anon-existent address on a letter and the actual address as the return address. You don't need a stamp this way. However

17) If you're making a public address, have a drink of water and take 15 seconds to get your thoughts together. No one will be any the wiser. 

18) Jump to the left

19) If you need to turn a light on and your eyes are already adjusted to the dark

20) House numbers on streets number away from the city.

21) If your shoes smell

22) If you were alive in 2006 you won the 2006 Time Magazine Person of The Year Award. In the addition when they announced the winner they said it was awarded to everyone and made the front cover as close to a mirror as possible. Use it on your CV. 

23) Always walk like you know where you're going. Works exceptionally well when trying to get past rent-a-cop security such as at concerts or festivals. 

24) If you ever find yourself in a situation where you're going to need to fight

25) Give girls presents that actually mean something to them. Just because they cost a lot doesn't mean they're going to like it. In fact if the reason you got it was because it was expensive chances are they won't like it at all. 

26) Learn from your mistakes. 

27) If your Internet isn't working, do them again until it does. 

28) You never know when you're going to need details. Always pay attention to the small things. 

29) Don't kid yourself 

30) Know the difference between its, their and they're. 

31) If you do not feel comfortable looking someone in the eyes

32) Eye contact in general can be used for a lot from comforting to intimidating. It is very powerful. Learn to use it appropriately. 

33) Chivalry is not dead. Open the door for girls and walk on the road side. 

34) Be confident.
