EDIT: I happen to have a cool Buffy autographed poster and I'd like to randomly give it away to one lucky fan who has participated in my AMA. http://i.imgur.com/QI1AU.jpg So after the chat is over I'll randomly pick someone and send you a private message. I also have some headshots which I'm happy to autograph


EDIT: Thank you so much! I had so much fun. It's noon and I have to do some work on my website now


EDIT: Okay so I closed my eyes and scrolled up and down the AMA page from yesterday and then randomly stopped and pointed at http://www.reddit.com/user/dampierp who is going to win the autographed poster I mentioned yesterday http://i.imgur.com/QI1AU.jpg . I have more prizes for more people though so if you didn't win just sit tight. I'll be picking more people to win more fun stuff. oxox Clare

""Giles is so funny and English.""

""Does Cordelia become part of the gang? I feel like she's going to become part of the gang. Otherwise there's no way they would focus so much on such a bitchy character.""

""Buffy is amazing. She is such a badass!""

""I don't understand these outfits."" 

""Oh God I already care so much about these people!""

My personal favourite quote:

This wouldn’t be complete without Anya’s emotional monologue and this is the point where I lose it.
&gt;**Anya**: But I don't understand! I don't understand how this all happens. How we go through this. I mean, there's just a body, and I don't understand why she just can't get back in it and not be dead anymore! It's stupid! It's mortal and stupid! And, and Xander's crying and not talking, and, and I was having fruit punch, and I thought, ever, and no one will explain to me why. (She puts her hand over her face


***

Interesting trivia:


**In the scene where Xander punched his hand through the wall


**The body is unique for a Buffy episode in that it features no incidental music. 
""The lack of music, almost a kind of boredom to create what I wanted to capture,"" Joss told us.**

My sister and I, what it was like filming Much Ado About Nothing (which is finally making it's premiere at Toronto film festival), the status of Doctor Horrible 2 and more awesomeness.

I asked him, saying ""If I cant hide at least a little as a writer than im not that good."" Very thoughtful and cool!

A few minutes later, ""Sorry if I was kinda mean about your question."" To which I said, ""Oh no, it was great."" After the pic, and in my ridiculous slightly buzzed and overwhelmed state, I said to him, Thanks so much for giving quirky, I just love nerdy

Before we left, or a simple ""aww"", he said, ""Ok, give me some sugar""........and gave me a big hug! It was one of the best moments of my life!

**Buffy**: You have to listen to me. The forces inside you are incredibly powerful. They're strong

**Willow Rosenberg**: Let me tell you something about Willow. She's a loser, up until college with her stupid mousy ways. And now... Willow's a junkie. The only thing Willow was ever good for... the only thing I had going for me... were the moments, just moments, when Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. And that will never happen again.

Willow allows all potential slayers to be granted their slayer ability.  
Throughout the series you get the feeling that being a slayer is more of a punishment than an honor. The final line of the show states that Buffy can now be a normal girl without so much worry. Doesn't that kind of take away from her story as being the hero and make her kind of selfish for ruining other peoples lives?

Buffy saves her from being turned into a slave. She then takes over Buffys apartment and takes the name Anne from her. Then we don't hear from her anymore in the show because Buffy leaves LA and goes back to Sunnydale.

They continued this story without mentioning that Anne had been helped by both Angel and Buffy a few times in her life. I love that

I'd been warned that it took a bit to get rolling but was worth it, fighting, and shorter story arcs were shit but I kept with it for 90's nostalgia (the music was pretty kick ass from the start IMO). After watching ALL of it, I'm glad I stuck with it.

I'm deeply impressed at some of the shocking moments of sadness and laughter the show managed to evoke. I definitely think a few of the episodes were genuinely scary even with the relatively low production value and special effects of big shows today. I can't help but wonder what this show could have looked like today

I loved recognizing actors from other Whedon shows I'd seen. Upon finishing Buffy I decided to give Angel a try and it was also awesome to see characters moving between the shows. It makes me wish a lot more shows were like this

My two best friends and I are among the world's biggest Buffy fans. About 8 years ago

Then one day, it was not for sale. It was owned by the school and was just for display. I inquired repeatedly about buying the poster, but was never given a serious reply. Eventually, the bookstore changed locations, and I never saw the poster again. :(

I've recently become financially comfortable and decided that since this may be the only time I'd ever have disposable income, no matter the cost... within reason. But it was the same thing. No internet search lead me to the sale of the poster.  I contacted the original publisher of the poster, the print company, some other sources... nothing. It had vanished. Then...

I thought to my self, and she was very nice. She told me she was flattered by my enthusiasm, and that she'd sell me 3 at $20 a piece. I was flabbergasted. I sent her a check in the mail, the old fashioned way, hoping this would be an honest transaction. IT WAS. A week or so later, 3 mint condition Chocolate Buffy posters arrived! 

I gave my two best friends their posters for Christmas along with some Sunnydale sweatshirts that I found on Ebay. Have you ever seen a grown 220 lb man fall to the floor

So here is a picture. http://imgur.com/a/m7qrS

I hope the artist doesn't mind me sharing this story. I don't know if she'd appreciate getting bombarded with poster requests or not. :/ The worst that could happen is that she'd say ""no!""

In case anybody didn't know, and also came to Anya's wedding. They are played by the same actress and it's generally accepted that they are probably the same character under different guises.

From the Wikipedia page:

&gt;In the season 6 episode ""Older and Far Away"", but when asked to explain this they both sheepishly deny being acquainted. This implies that Halfrek had previously been Cecily. However, Halfrek and Anya witnessed the Crimean War (circa 1853) which is mentioned in ""Lessons"" and shown in ""Selfless"". The timing of this event would indicate that Halfrek existed as a demon at least three decades prior to the adoption of youthful human form in Cecily. 

With regards to whether this is canon or not:
&gt;Joss Whedon and Kali Rocha have both made statements that Halfrek and Cecily were indeed the same entity.**[citation needed]**

It's entirely possible for Cecily to have been alive as a demon long before William was born

However

&gt;What's interesting is that I think the writers really screwed some things up with this. They made Cecily and Halfrek the same character, and that in actuality having Halfrek as Cecily retcons some important things. The meta author, for example, makes the point that in establishing Halfrek as Cecily, it completely changes the context of her rejection of William in 'Fool For Love'. If the writers really explored this, it could've been brilliant in regard to Spike's character arc:

&gt;This is some of the best philosophical shit they could have thrown at us. This pulls the rug out from under Spike's arc so profoundly in a way that really comments -- brilliantly -- on the way he builds and rebuilds himself constantly in opposition to the solipsized muses he creates out of objectified women. Cecily literally wasn't real. The fact that Halfrek and Spike never have a conversation in the entire run of the series is among the most profound missed opportunities around

as said in the title I'm currently re-watching Buffy (done it before, how was the reaction of the fans (aka you) when Dawn was first introduced? 

Pretending that she always was here is a plot device many TV shows used before and most of the time it's done bad. Did you originally think that's the case here or was it quite common knowledge that it has to have a ""mystic"" reason? Was she loved

So many questions... Let's discuss initially annoying Dawn from the point of view from someone who doesn't know her future and reason!

Someone was asking if Willow ever told Oz or Tara that she loved them. Well... I could definitely think of a few times she said she loved Tara:

**Family** - While they're dancing ""It makes me love you more.""

**The Body** - She mouths ""I love you""

**Tough Love** - ""You're the only woman I ever loved so how could you take me seriously?""
 
**Tabula Rasa** - ""I love you

Also in **Tough Love** while kinda fighting with Buffy she spits out ""When it's someone you love as much as I love Tara?""

**New Moon Rising** -

&gt;Tara: No
&gt;
Willow: [smiles] I am.

Now

&gt;OK, she likes you. You spend time together, feelings grow deeper, and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're *in love*. Time stops, And it feels like the whole world's made for you two, until the day one of you leaves and rips the still-beating heart from the other

But it isn't really a statement that she loved Oz, necessarily, but very different. If she really never truly said she loved Oz... that's kinda interesting isn't it?
