[**click here for part 2**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1fsciu/returning_mapler_guide_pt2_classes/)


Quite a few people have been making threads asking the same question:


What has changed from when I last played?

Maplestory is a very rapidly changing game

Most of the people asking this haven’t played since before the most influential patch and change to the game was made
This patch occurred on December 7th 2010.

The patch was HUGE for Maplestory. The UI was completely overhauled.The EXP rate and curve was COMPLETELY changed. Before, most notably, Victoria Island. Victoria Island may now be navigated using a central location called “Six Paths Crossing” which is a large tree that allows you to head to any region of Victoria as well as the Intercontinental station allowing ou to travel to other continents. 



Here is a list of things that were added or changed and a brief overview of what they are.

* Potential System: Item can now have a ""hidden potential"" which can be revealed with a magnifying glass purchased at NPC shops. These ""hidden potentials"" add stats to your weapon such as 4% INT or +12 STR.

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIj/equipment-upgrading-101-potentials)

* Enhancement: After scrolling all available slots on an item

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIk/equipment-upgrading-101-enhancements)

* Nebulites: Nebulites are yet another way to upgrade your equipment.

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIl/equipment-upgrading-101-nebulites)


* Aditional Potential System: Using items from the Cash Shop

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIj/#potentials)

* EVO World: The EVO world is a customizable hunting ground that can be accessed 5 times a day. 

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/MapleStory-Guide-Evolution-World-Guide-453.html)

* Party Quests: PQ's have now been compressed into a single room accessible through the inter-dimensional portal. When inside the PQ room

* Inner Abilities: Using a circulator from Azwan, party quests, and games. This experience is separate and provides stat increases.

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FLx/inner-abilities)

* Azwan: A new area accessible through the inter-dimensional portal. Here you can complete a questline, and gain Honor EXP which can be used to earn Inner Abilities (see above)

for more info see [this guide](http://www.mapleguide.net/fight-for-azwan/)

* Familiars: Monsters now drop “Familiar” cards as well as the old “Monster” cards. These cards can be used to summon the monster and have it follow you around. Monsters each have different effects ranging from health boosts to meso drop rates.

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/forum/2248216/1/Monster_Familiar_Effects.html)


* Hyper Skills: After reaching level 140, and add additional skills. 

for more info see [this guide](http://orangemushroom.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/kmst-ver-1-2-446-inkwells-secret-diary-hyper-skills/)

* Professions: You may now learn 2 professions which allow you to craft items. The professions are: Herbalism, Smithing, and Accessory Crafting.

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/forum/2072074/5/Profession_Skill_Guide.html)

* Silent Crusade: at level 75 you receive a questline that allows you to earn coins through various tasks and use them to purchase items from Edelstein.

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/MapleStory-Guide-Silent-Crusade-Questline-Guide-416.html)


* Job Advancement: The level at which job advancements are made ahs been adjusted to
2nd job: level 30
3rd job: level 60
4th job: level 100

Remember, or corrections, please PM me.

(sorry for my bad english)
I have never been to this reddit before but i went here to share my story.

This is more than 6 years ago.
Me and my brother wasnt very close at the time, my friend in school told me about a game where you could connect with other people like WoW, with awesome feelgood gameplay and epic music.
So all my friends including me started playing this game and oh boy did i love it
Eventually my brothers friends heard of this game and so my brother started playing the game

I met a player ingame that was from the same country, we could play the whole weekend without a single break. We could party up with his friends and roam around the world just writing to eachother and laughing at everything.

One late friday my mom came home with some food, open his door and my brother isnt there, he's in the bathroom, i walked up to his computer to get a shock, on his screen i can se my own character and my friend, my brother.

Dinnertime!

I didn't tell my brother what i've just seen and realized.
I though why ruin the good bond me and him have gotten in Maplestory.

Days went by and we kept on playing like we always did
I just got out of bed and logged into maplestory

And I was like ""how did he? ...uhm.""
Before i got the time to answer he wrote ""Can we talk *my name* ?""
My brother tells me this amazing story of how he missed how close we were and how he missed hanging out with me.
He asked my friends about the game and looked me up and here we are.
That day changed everything


And to add

Now i dont play

Theres my story

heres a song you can put on while you read.

So I whisp him and within a few minutes, I wouldn't be able to do my favourite bosses anymore. I couldn't dojo, couldn't do Empress and it was really depressing because I had JUST gotten my fafnir weapon. That's pretty much all I have and I'm working towards finishing the set.

Anyways, the usual level 200 fully NX'ed but it was really well done. I saw his dragon and remembered when I was an Evan in KMS and his equips were mostly the best you could find. I was then inspired by both his trust in me and everything else. It's so hard to find people who you can trust and he did it without question. Sure you might call him stupid but it was so... precious to me.

That's not even it though, I was devastated. I told him I was extremely sorry and that I'd pay him back. He said np, got some more NX and sent it to me without a question and the gloves were originally for 200m. I just wanted to get rid of them. So I owe this guy 400m for the psok and I tell him I'll give him the gloves for free and another 200m on my drk.

Then he says it's fine and gives me 100m anyways saying how cheap the gloves were. That's what really touched me. It's so hard to find decent people on Maple nowadays and this guy, and everything else, he's nice enough to do that.
I honestly wouldn't care if the gloves are worth 3b

Too bad his BL list was full

1352991283.0,138oub,Hello Maplers! Here's some general (and useful) information about the current Meso Ranger event!,zldslim,53,8,29,"As I'm sure you're all currently aware

The overview of this event is

I'm here to tell you one of the best and most efficient ways to get Meso Ranger equips!

There are a total of 8 event quests available that are part of the Meso Ranger event

 - 3 quests require you to kill 200 monsters around your level
 - 4 quests require you to pick up books from monsters around your level.

To actually GET the Meso Ranger equipment you have to take a 'test' that requires one piece of Bravery
There are 3 tiers of each piece needed for the exam and each will give you different amounts of points towards your test score (remember you only need to score 1000 to get an equip).

There are 2 different parts of the test, you can get an additional 500 points for free. The best answer combination and the one that is imperative to this is...

**3, 1, 3.**

If you use this combination for the question portion you'll get 500 free points. Remember this

So you should have a general idea as to how the event works now. It's time to find out a great way to get equips quickly!

First off you'll need to find a training spot around your level. Another great event going on right now gives you a free Resistance character at level 30- that's what I used to get most of my equips

Once you find monsters around your level, pick up all the books (and the Bravery, Will and Trust that drops! Those are important!). But once you finish them, **don't turn in all the quests right away.**

**This part is also important and can double the amount of equips you get each time you do the round of quests.**

If, Trust, and Will) that you picked up from killing monsters, here's what you do to maximize your profit.

1. Turn in the 4 book quests and only those quests.
2. Take the exam. Since you're using the lowest tier of tokens
3. Use the combination **3, 1, 3,** for the multiple choice part to get 500 more points.

By doing this you'll end up with one random Meso Ranger equip

But wait, Willful Will and I think Trustful Trust?), first tier tokens are green, second tier are blue. **If you have two green tokens and one blue token, here's what you do to get one more random equip than you normally would.**

Keep in mind **this part is only if you picked up one blue token while you were hunting monsters** (in addition to already having two green tokens).

1. Since you still have the 3 token quests to turn in and already have one blue token
2. Take the test. You should have 2 blue tokens and one green token that show up in the window now.
3. You'll get 500 points from your token combination before you take the multiple choice part.
4. Use the combination 3, 1, 3, on the multiple choice part to get a total score of 1000.

And there you have it. So far you've gotten 2 pieces of equipment from one round of quests! And you're not even finished yet.

You should still have 2 more quests to turn in. Both will yield tier 2 tokens. Turn them in and take the test again. **Don't forget about the combo 3, 1, 3 to get your score to 1000**. 

And that's pretty much it!

**TL;DR: There are ways to maximize your turnout from the Meso Ranger event quests. If you have 3 green tokens once you've completed the quests, 1, 1, 3 for the multiple choice part!**

This new update represents that change in the MapleStory community. It used to be a community where there were few worlds, Broa, and Windia) had enough server load to lag crappy computers. FM ch1 had 3 times as many people as it has now; the economy was bigger and better. Instead of killing monsters and doing quests that would get you to level 70 in an hour, people did Kerning PQ, Ludi PQ, LMPQ, OPQ

None of that is true anymore. I can't find people in the Free Market to sell things to; no one does the lower level party quests anymore, Korwyn, Novinha, Starlightzz, and LoOpEdd may/will disappear from the front page, and the memory of what MapleStory once was will disappear with them.

1358374330.0,16plnc,Root Abyss guide,Xnfbqnav,40,2,32,"This guide is incomplete, as a lot of this is just guesswork from what I've witnessed.

It should also be noted that this guide is not entirely accurate for the Chaos versions of these bosses as they all have some extra tricks up their sleeves

**General**

Unlike previous bosses, each boss has a gimmick. If you don't know the gimmick, you're gonna have a rough time. Also, each boss has a limited number of continues. Each party member has 5 lives, and after dying 5 times, you're kicked out of the map. Finally, it should be noted that between a level 200 who fights the bosses the same way they'd fight Zakum and a level 140 who knows all of the patterns and can dodge, while the 200 will just use up all 5 of their lives instantly.

**Von Bon**

Von Bon is the first and easiest of the bosses. He has 5 attacks

* Cane Whack - Von Bon raises his cane up and smacks you with it. Only used when someone is in range. Deals ~6000 damage.
* Energy Beam - Von Bon waves his cane around in circles 3 times before throwing a beam of energy out from it. Deals ~9000 damage. Ignores buffs.
* Earthquake - Von Bon jumps up and... lands. Deals 90% of your total HP. Ignores buffs.
* Whirlwind - Von Bon disappears for a second and then pops up somewhere else as a Whirlwind. Deals ~6000 damage and super knockback.
* Time Warp - Von Bon casts a debuff on someone. After a few seconds
* Time Rift - Von Bon raises his cane up and creates a crack in time somewhere in the map. Does no damage.

At the start of the fight, and Time Rift. To avoid Cane Whack, you must simply get out of range before it deals damage. To avoid Energy Beam, you only have to jump over the projectile, which, by the way, will instantly kill ANY magician class. It does not give even a single shit about Magic Guard. 

As for Time Rift, you must lure Von Bon into the black clocks that he creates, while keeping him out of the white ones. While Von Bon is standing in a black clock, the timer will increase at a constant rate, giving you more time to finish him off. While he's in a white clock, however, the timer decreases rapidly

After you get Von Bon down to about 50% of his max HP, Earthquake is easily avoided by jumping. Kaisers should avoid transforming at this point to avoid being stuck on the ground.

At about 25% health

At about 10% health, anyone close enough will take damage be knocked back and anyone that attempts to approach or attack him while he's in a whirlwind will take damage and be knocked back as well. Take this moment to recast any buffs. You can't do much else.

In short

**Pierre**

Pierre is the second boss, and you aren't pressured to keep your health at max since he doesn't have any map wide 90% HP attacks like Von Bon. Pierre has 7 attacks. I also do not know the real names of these.

* Umbrella Strike - Pierre raises his umbrella up and then hits the ground with it. Deals ~4000 damage.
* [Umbrella Blast](http://i.imgur.com/Upgue.gif) - Pierre holds his umbrella out and then opens it. Deals ~12000 damage and super knockback.
* Hat Trick - Several jester hats fall from the sky and trap anyone under them. Deals 100% damage if escape is unsuccessful
* Color Shift - Pierre changes to either Red Pierre or Blue Pierre. Deals no damage.
* Whirlwind - Pierre turns into a whirlwind and pursues a player
* Umbrella Whack - Pierre whacks someone with his umbrella. Deals ~6000 damage. Only used while transformed into Red Pierre.
* Beatdown - Pierre disappears briefly before reappearing somewhere nearby and attacking 3 times. Deals ~60000 damage. Only used while transformed into Red Pierre.

Much like Von Bon, Umbrella Blast, and Hat Trick. Umbrella Strike and Umbrella Blast are easy to dodge. For Umbrella Strike, simply jump or get out of the danger zone, which is right in front of Pierre. For Umbrella Blast, you need to get out of range, which is also the area directly in front of Pierre.

Hat Trick is cast continuously during the fight, hats fall on them. If you are above a pentacle when the hats drop, you will be trapped underneath a hat for several seconds, preventing all movement and skills. While underneath a hat, you must continuously tap the left and right arrow keys until you break free. If you're too slow, you will die instantly.

At about 50% health, he will be healed instead of damaged. While Pierre is transformed into either Red Pierre or Blue Pierre, he will cease using Umbrella Strike, Umbrella Blast, and Hat Trick and start using transformation specific skills.

While Pierre is transformed into Blue Pierre, but it will not seal you. According to one commenter, Pierre takes extra damage in this form, but I wasn't paying attention to my own numbers.

While Pierre is transformed into Red Pierre, which will kill most classes instantly. When he uses Beatdown, he will not move very far, and there is a small delay from when he reappears and when he does the attack. If you are for any reason near him when he reappears, move. Move very quickly.

All in all

**Bloody Queen (WIP)**

I do not know how to determine how much HP Lovely Mirror will heal Bloody Queen for. I've seen it heal her for 10% at times

Bloody Queen is some bullshit. Of the 5 attacks she has

* Slash - The standard attack. Bloody Queen pulls her arm back and makes a wide sweeping motion, poison, or darkness.
* Face Swap - Bloody Queen changes to a different face.
* Fire Plume - Bloody Queen turns black and blows a pink plume of fire in front of her. Deals 100% of the player's max HP in damage. Only used in Normal mode.
* Crimson Shield - Bloody Queen clasps her hands together and creates a large red shield around herself
* Lovely Mirror - Bloody Queen sticks a finger up in the air and creates a magic mirror somewhere in the map that either lasts until it is destroyed or until its timer runs out. The mirror will cast seduction on nearby players and cause them to walk toward it. If a player touches the mirror while seduced
* Black Hole - Bloody Queen holds her hand out and creates a black hole on the ground

Bloody Queen is a veritable pain in the ass to fight from start to finish. First thing you need to know is that her slash attack, as the status conditions it causes all have great synergy with her insta-kill attacks. While Bloody Queen is in Normal mode, Slash will cause darkness, preventing you from seeing her. While Bloody Queen is in Weeping mode, Slash will cause poison. While Bloody Queen is in Winking mode, Slash will cause seal, slowing you down from destroying her mirrors. While Bloody Queen is in Grinning mode, making you inadvertently walk into the black holes yourself.

In Normal mode, but if you're a slower class and already decently far from her, just create some distance. You do have to be quick, though, she only prepares for about half a second before raining death upon anyone too slow to get out of the way. If she blinds you, just run to the edge of the map that she's not at.

In Weeping mode

In Winking mode, and are overall pretty nasty. Make sure you have all cures or holy waters for this, as Slash will cause your skills to be sealed up. If you are affected by her mirror's seduction, the best course of action is to curse as many times as possible before you die or a teammate frees you.

In Grinning mode, jump and try to get out, as they will kill you very quickly.

I still haven't beaten her. A lot of this may get updated once I do

**Vellum**

Remember when I said Von Bon is the easiest? I lied. Vellum, he spared your life because he cannot possibly *take* it from you. Now, his attacks.

* Dig - Vellum goes underground for a bit and then creates a yellow pentacle before popping up. Deals ~12000 damage and super knockback.
* Stalactite Crash - Several dark red pentacles appear on the ground before stalactites fall on them. Stuns.
* Fireball - Vellum glows white and then shoots off several fireballs. Deals 100% of the player's HP.
* Leap - Vellum goes underground for a bit and then creates a giant yellow pentacle before leaping from one end of the pentacle to the other. Deals 100% of player HP as damage.
* Poison Field - Vellum goes underground for a bit and then creates a yellow pentacle before popping up close to the ground. Vellum then glows green and creates several green lasting pentacles. Deals 3600 damage.

Vellum starts the fight off using only Dig and Stalactite Crash. Both of these attacks are insanely easy to avoid and neither of them are likely to kill you anyway. Simply stand away from the yellow pentacles that appear right before Vellum pops up and avoid the dark red ones and you're fine. Attack as much as possible

Once Vellum reaches about 75% HP, players that are directly in front of him will be killed, as this is an OHKO move. Luckily, you don't even need to get fully behind Vellum to avoid damage. Simply standing under him will suffice. If you're capable of dodging Dig, you should be able to dodge this.

1342223073.0,wixvc,I am a maplestory addict :( ,MapleAddict,39,8,32,"**WARNING: WALL OF TEXT AHEAD**

For the last seven years, my addiction has destroyed virtually every aspect of my well being, from my health, to my socioeconomic status, to my ability to function as a valuable component of society. This seemingly mundane hobby evolved much too far without my intentions, and now I sit here, a hopeless shell of a person.  However, that “brrringg” sound when you level up


My history as a mapler started during the game’s Beta testing period while I was in elementary school back in 2005. I had hopped around various online games such as RuneScape and Ragnarok, I saw MapleStory manifesting itself into my real life. Many of my school friends began playing, and the game became somewhat of an after-school social hangout.


Everything was fine for about a year until my addiction truly began. New content was being released after the beta test was over, but they never agreed, until I began throwing tantrums. “ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN ME IN MAPLESTORY!” I screamed viciously at my parents every day. I destroyed bits and pieces of my house, punched walls, and gave my parents an ultimatum: upgrade the internet or I will destroy the house. I’m not sure if it was my perpetual nagging or my parents’ need to adapt to newer technology, but they eventually did it. 	MapleStory continued to consume my childhood; I would draw pictures of my character and various monsters on every single class assignment I had, I listened to MapleStory music in my free time on CDs in my car, such as a park, even stealing it from him when he thought it was enough. 


Middle School was startin’ and hormones were a-ragin’. Everyone was excited to meet new friends, and that they did. I wasn’t in love with the game exclusively, I also found myself addicted to the Maple culture.  Most of my clothing consisted of MapleStory shirts I had ordered online, and my room was full of plushies of all types of monsters. I discovered forums such as basilmarket and sleepywood and spent lunch every day in the school library reading them, participating in maplestory discussions, and making maplestory comics using paint and photoshop. I started bringing footage of my gameplay into the school library and using their video editing software to make MMV’s and stuff like that. Cash shop was introduced and I began saving all of my lunch money in order to buy NX cash. I quit any other hobbies I had, such as basketball, and as I entered high school


This is where many of the most destructive habits formed. Throughout high school, and clothes; but there was a burning desire for “more” within me. I needed cash, and lots of it. I began by trying to “work” with jobs such as babysitting but those tasks took too much time away from my mapling, so I began stealing cash from my parents’ wallets, but I reazlied that they would soon notice. Instead, I began stealing jewelry from my grandparents’ house and selling it. I noted that they too would eventually notice, so I deliberately stole whatever I could from wherever I could—supermarkets, school—and selling it on craigslist in order to make money to buy NX. Eventually, and much of it still goes to Nexon. 


Maplestory also affected my sexuality generously. Since my addiction started at the root of adolescence, just admiring cute avatars and well-drawn fan art of attractive characters. Eventually, like any other teenager, I started masturbating, but not to porn like the rest of my peers, but to hardcore maplestory hentai. I searched the internet and compiled folders upon folders of maplestory hentai, even saving some of it on my phone so I could fap on-the-go. I fapped to maplestory hentai exclusively until I started having cyber sex with one of my guild-mates. Eventually, I had multiple online bfs and gfs and I regularly cybered with them. One of them even stopped in a town nearby and we met up


Throughout my addiction, and have little to no connection with my family. However, I know that morally these things “matter” but in all honesty, I don’t really care. I don’t feel depressed or lacking in anything in life, but when I think about my life in the context of normal society, I see myself as “pathetic”. 


Anyways, not as strongly as it did in my youth (I'm looking for a job, working on school), and there is much more I can add, but I don’t want to bore you guys, I just needed to get everything off of my chest and am thankful to have found a community such as Reddit who will listen, unlike basilmarket who will just say “gtfo u stupid n00b get a lyf.” If there are any suggestions you guys have, let me know! 


**TLDR: addicted to maplestory for 7 years, strongly influenced my sexuality, health, etc. ;still continues but I can’t seem to give a damn.**

1356573872.0,15hw6a,MechSoySauce's Guide to Maxing Traits (as requested),lolimalion,32,8,13,"**Traits Leveling Guide:**

**Ambition:**

1) Party Option - Kenta 10 times a day killing 20 pianuses each being worth 37 ambition each.

2) Solo Option - Go to security cameras in magatia (most accessible boss for a 29 ambition) or another ""wild boss"" and kill the boss. Channel surf and kill all the bosses.

3) Hot Time Events - Wear the special hats they give you on the character you want to boost traits. If you do this option

**Empathy:**

1) Cheap Option - Herb Pick in the Herb Mines until you reach the daily cap of 500.

2) Expensive/Fast Option - Buy a ton of the Basic Herb Oil Bottles, unlearn, relearn, and repeat the process. You'll need a ton of super moos for this. This process doesn't count toward your daily trait cap. You are highly recommended to max diligence first because it will make you gain double mastery experience 20% of the time, making you use less resources&gt;less expensive to level herbalism.

To guarantee leveling (w/o any double mastery %):

1 to 2: make 13 oils

2 to 3: make 30 oils

3 to 4: make 53 oils

4 to 5: make 80 oils

5 to 6: make 113 oils

6 to 7: make 150 oils

7 to 8: make 193 oils

8 to 9: make 240 oils

9 to 10: make 293 oils

Total: At most 1165 oils need to be made. Each cycle will get you at least 2 trait levels.

**Insight:**

1) Cheap/Efficient Option - Mine in the Ore Mines until you reach the daily cap of 500.

2) Expensive/Lazy/Non-efficient Option - Reveal a ton of hidden potted gear with Premium glasses.

**Willpower:**

1) Party Option - Complete Kenta 10 times a day for 440 willpower

2) Stay Online for consecutive hours.

3) Expensive/Fast Option - Buy a ton of the Basic Molds, unlearn, relearn, and repeat the process. You'll need a ton of super moos for this. This process doesn't count toward your daily trait cap. You are highly recommended to max diligence first because it will make you gain double mastery experience 20% of the time, making you use less resources&gt;less expensive to level Mining.

To guarantee leveling (w/o any double mastery %):

1 to 2: make 13 plates

2 to 3: make 30 plates

3 to 4: make 53 plates

4 to 5: make 80 plates

5 to 6: make 113 plates

6 to 7: make 150 plates

7 to 8: make 193 plates

8 to 9: make 240 plates

9 to 10: make 293 plates

Total: At most 1165 plates need to be made. Each cycle will get you at least 2 trait levels.

4) Hot Time Events - Wear the special hats they give you on the character you want to boost traits. If you do this option

**Diligence:**

1) Cheap Option - Smelt 50 plates for the daily cap.

2) Expensive/Fast Option - Buy/Make a ton of Opal/Silver Plates and level Smithing by making arrows (OR whatever you'll actually use this is the cheapest powerleveling option) for the diligence bonus. Once you reach level 10 Smithing, and repeat the process. You'll need a ton of super moos for this. This process doesn't count toward your daily trait cap. No estimation on materials needed for this due to the many things you can make, but it's the same process as the other powerleveling methods.

**Charm:**

1) Fast/Expensive Option - Buy tons of NX and do the hair

2) Party/Cheap Option - Complete Kenta 10 times a day for 260 charm

3) Solo/Cheap/Efficient Option - Do Monster Park (especially during 2x drop). Buy 5 monster park tickets a day (there's a limit of 5 per day), and once you have used up all your tickets, buy a lot of the Spiegelmann's Mustaches from the Monster Park NPC. Equip all the mustaches for the 100 charm each mustache. Think of each coin that you pick up as +2 charm since 50 coins gets you an 100 charm mustache.

There is a chance that you will be notified that there's a special monster on the map, making it even easier to level charm.

To be optimal in Monster Park, and monster park during 2x and if possible, with a 2x coupon.

1367450745.0,1dijwa,A Somewhat Comprehensive Kaiser Bossing Guide,MrTilly,26,5,16,"So this isn't really a great guide, (Not funded

First things first: This is my how to boss guide as a Kaiser to maximize dps/m

1.) Gigas Wave is your highest DPS output.

2.) Wing Beat should ALWAYS be stacked on a boss regardless if the boss DR's or not.

3.) As you find fit

4.)  Stone Dragon can be summoned as often as possible to hit high numbers periodically and group mobs towards him.^1

5.) Inferno the ground as often as you can seeing as the ""flame tiles"" will increase your dps more than not! (Be careful on DR!)^1

6.)  Ancestral Prominence deals massive damage and should be used as the cooldown is ready!^1

Basically as a Kaiser your main idea is keeping Wing Beat on an enemy and slamming the enemy with Gigas Wave.  Now many people think that your damage goes up so much while in Final Transformation.  **This is NOT correct**.  Though you will add extra lines and increase your damage

How To Time DR's:  Of course most of the popular bosses have a damage reflect.  Now the best thing about being a Kaiser is that you can attack through Boss buffs such as DR, ONLY trans during the DR and drop trans right as it ends.  For anyone who is 150+ and has the hyper skill: *Majestic Presence* can potentially never have to transform.  Once you can anticipate DR's and time them you'll be able to attack through them.

Wing Beat Stacking: You can stack your Untrans'd blue wing beats on top of your trans'd purple wing beats for a total of 6 wing beats at a time.  It is highly recommended to throw up three wing beats right before you transform to maximize DPS.^1

Somewhat Infinite Transformation: ""[Y]ou can technically stay in transform 100% of the time. When your current transform is about to end turn on tempest blades; When it does end use majesty then launch the blades and throw 3 wingbeats

DRAGON BARRAGE I-FRAMES:  This is my FAVORITE part about being a Kaiser, (pardon my poor commentating) I display the correct way to utilize your I-Frames: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzIaWLl-fl8  Using this you can dodge 1/1s Seduce and anything else that some random boss will throw at you.  Not to mention that Cursebite will give you resistance to states.

If you're still sticking with me through this horribly put together guide


Wing Beat Healing: While Wing Beat is stacked on an opponent Gigas Wave will heal MORE than it should.  I don't know if this is a glitch or intended, giving you CLOSE to 10% hp every time you use Gigas Slash which makes you nearly invulnerable.

Blade Storm I-Frames:  I've noticed that occasionally while SPAMMING Blade Storm I'm invincible while I keep using it

I hope all of this helps!  It's a very poorly formulated guide, seeing as they fixed Terms and Conditions a little while back.

1375120861.0,1jagnn,Story from an old player. IGN: yankskinz Server: Mardia,SoggyLettuce,28,9,10,"Hey guys. I used to sink a lot of time into this game back in the early days probably starting in about 2007. Took me forever to get to 30 and I played a fucking wizard class with only the frozen tuna (I didn't know how to use spells and shit ok? The tuna was a fucking beast) which was interesting. Probably the most exciting things for me back then were gm events and finding king slimes. 

Then I got a bit more competent and made an aran after they came out. Got it up to 100 and probably put in $150 worth of mesos on those sketchy meso selling sites and funded his equips. Then I got some nexon cash or whatever it's called and bought a mount.

Now this mount was a helicopter and I happened to discover quite the glitch with it. Honestly it was the weirdest fucking glitch and I abused the hell out of it. So when you held a polearm (and I was an aran) and then tried to move in the mount your game would crash imediately. So I was a bit pissed that my mount that I payed for was crashing my game but honestly what more could I expect from nexon? I wanted to actually move in the mount so I would equip then unequip (keybind) and then move a bit and repeat.Turned out that when you held a polearm (other weapons did not have this effect) and went on and off of the mount and spammed that while slowly moving forward (but never when you were on the mount) it crashed every player in the area you were in. So that was amazing. Need an FM1 spot? I got you covered. Favorite grinding area full? Crash em all. I never got caught either. I was able to use it for a good 40-50 days until it was fixed and my mount expired. 

Then I grinded and made a crimson arcglaive to 145 attack unhammered with those 50% scrolls and white scrolls and made a lot of weird shit like a stirgeman's cloak of justice and a lot of stirgeman's pants....That shit was cool. I think I had like 6% strength red goggles too and glasses were rare as fuck.

Reached level 137 and then I got scammed by a friend and lost my crimson arcglaive I had put so much into. So I gave all my shit away (to a guy who might have been named 0DarkKnight0 that plays under names like 0Dark(insert class here)0 but anyways) and that was that. Sure I regret giving all of it away but at the time I just wanted to make it so I couldn't go back again. And it worked. I haven't played since but I kind of do just to see things again.

This post was a bit odd but I just wanted to share my fond memories of the place.

Also if you know a guy named 0DarkKnight0 or something similar tell him about this thread and tell him that it was fun playing the game with him.

I will be helping people out with anything I can possibly help with but here are a few things I can do off the top of my head.

**Zakum Runs**

As long as you have your pre quests done I will be doing 2 Zakum runs a day and anyone is welcome to join me. Do you need books? Come join. Want a Zakum Helm? Come join. Just wanna do runs for fun? Come join! 

**Targa/Scarlion Runs**

I can help anyone who wants a Targa or Scarlion helm get one. It is easier to do this if two people come with me but if only one person needs one at a time then I can use another computer at my house to log on a mule account.

**Horntail Runs**

These will need to be set up a little bit in advance since to make these go faster I will need to get a friend to come with us. So let me know like a day ahead of time if you want to do a Horntail run so I can set it up. Also if you have a Badge (Still getting mine atm) and wanna help out with this then feel free to let me know!

**Hilla Runs**

This is another alternative for people too get Skill Books if they can't do Zakum pre quests. This one is a bit harder for me since I play a Demon Slayer and even though my damage is fine her Damage Reflect really messes me up. That being said I can still solo her if you need it and I can get someone too easily come help if need be!

**Alien Doors**

I am able to door people too Aliens but it will be a 1 door per person per day thing. I don't want to have to keep logging on to door you 4-5 times because you forgot potions

**Other PQ's/Expeditions**

I don't do many other PQ's/Expeditions but if someone needs/wants to do a different one than posted just let me know. I will learn how to do them in advance so that I can do quick and efficient runs. Just let me know!

**Guild Invites**

I am part of a smaller guild that is fairly new but we always have nice people online! Anyone is welcome to join our little family as long as you are kind and respectful to your other fellow players! Being in the guild is NOT required to get my help



**Small FAQ:**

*What's your name good sir?*

My name is Seth and my main characters name is CrossedLotus.

*What class is your main?*

I think I already mentioned it but I play a Demon Slayer and as of this post he is 161. I also sometimes play my 154 Hayato who's IGN is CalmingLotus.

*What is your range?*

Not gonna brag about it but just know it is enough to solo a good portion of bosses (Non Hard Mode).

*Why are you helping out?*

Why not? But seriously I just want to meet some cool new people and I know how it feels to not know many people and have trouble with certain content in game because you aren't able to get the best gear.

*Do I need to do anything in return for you? :o*

Nope. This is all free and it shall be free for as long as I play this game! Though a thank you is always appreciated and make sure to let other people know about me if they need help with anything!

*What bosses can you not help with at the moment?*

I can't help you with Pink Bean (Never tried but I doubt it anyways)

*What time zone do you live in?*

I live in PST which is the time that Maplestory/Nexon is synced to.

Thank you for reading all this and I hope too see and help you guys out in game! :D

Thanks to my sister's generosity and the timing of the summer revamp, some of whom I still play other games with to this day. We began anew on the server Chaos, hoping to get a fresh start in a new world so that we could have a chance at being maple legends. This sadly wasn't meant to be, as within weeks the server truly earned its name. Hacks and exploits went rampant at this time, due to a popular hacking website introducing a free trial of their program. (This website still to this day is a parasite sucking the life out of the game.)

After my guild fell apart, and some of my friends seemed to graduate from Maplestory. Without my 'IRL' friends to play with, I saw no reason in playing the game. I contemplated selling my accounts, as I had offers from in-game friends going into the hundreds. Luckily, I found the Maplestory subreddit, where I found Mike, or DevenAtuDeae as many knew him at the time. Mike invited me into his guild

Two level 160's and over 15 billion mesos. That's what I have done since I joined reddit. But even still, is meaningless. Why is it meaningless? Because I gain nothing from it and my old friends aren't there to enjoy it with me.

These are the 2 reasons why I'm quitting. Because it's finally my time to join my old friends. I'm nearly 20 years old

Nothing. I gain nothing from this game or in this game anymore. The only people who seem to get anywhere are those who've got more time than me, but what about Empress? What about Magnus? What about Root Abyss? These bosses are where the profit lie, but Nexon guards them like they're sacred relics. We hear every week about someone being unjustly banned because of the excessive and poorly coded hack prevention that Nexon is using. This is a result of Nexon letting a problem going unsolved for too long. I'm glad that they finally caught on, but it seems like it's too late for them to fix the problem. Even they seem to be getting every last bit they can from the game with all the pay-to-win events they launch.

I won't say I didn't enjoy the time I've had playing this game

I'll miss you guys. 

Mike, and the rest of reddit: It's been a blast, and I'll try to hop on every few months to check on you guys. 

Gary, Josh, and Brian: I'll always miss coming back to school everyday and talking to you all about our adventures of the previous day. 

Shelby, and the rest of the Chaos Executives: I wish our guild didn't have to end the way it did, but at least we had a good run.

Back in the day, and I mostly used Bera.

I left after Broa was created (and I think I logged back on once and created some beginner in Windia but it never went anywhere).

So I came back to Maplestory after it was released on Steam nearly eight years later as a 21 year old now. And here's what I found:

* **The main towns on Victoria Island seem dead to me.** They used to be *packed* with people trying to sell stuff, at least in Bera when I walk around. Lith Harbor? Ha. I even accidentally went to some other town through some portal thing, and I couldn't find anyone there either. I've logged into all these different times of day; I ended up doing the 'Mushking Quest' by myself (I just created a party and had to kill those mofos with my now fighter by myself, ech). What happened to everyone?

* **I don't understand the new classes at all and the odd stories that come with them**. I was thinking about going to one of the new servers, I seemed to end up in these awful, awful, awful cutscene things about a spaceship and guns and stuff. I looked online and it said 'explorers are the traditional choices' or whatever, but ""Jett"" seems to be the only explorer I can create; I finally figured it out a few minutes ago that I had to click a different button instead. The other classes just make things more... confusing. And also, pirates?!? (Although those aren't nearly as bad as the others). And it looks silly. Speaking of...

* **Everyone in this game looks like magical fairies with pixie dust surrounding them now.** I remember when the Cash Shop was first created, and suddenly everyone looks like they're in a K-Pop band with sparkles slowly dropping around them. I dunno, I miss the times when there weren't Call of Duty-style badges that would brand people and simpler uniform stuff (where I could look at someone and say, ""Oh! Crusader! Right!"").

* *Leveling up has become much easier*. I managed to gain about ten levels in a day. I still went ""Whaaaa!!"" to this, the sheer grind of it. It's nice to know that the work you're putting into something isn't just for nothing; maybe it's not as satisfying as it once was, but whatever.

Sorry about the tone throughout this, grandson!!"" Maybe I am, the sheer amount of servers now is kind of shocking to me. Here's to playing and grinding alone for the time being though on Victoria Island (I can't believe how much bigger it's gotten either, 'El Nath'!! Ha! Wow!). I do miss this game a bit though, so y'all might see me around here now and then. :)",,False,t5_2rrdo,True

2. Acquire by some means 5k NX-which is doable through the public surveys

3. This is where not being active for 6 months comes in. Coming in after a long break gives you the privilege of buying ANY item in the Cash Shop for 10% of its original price. From this knowledge

4. But what do you need 5k nx for if you're only buying 3k NX? You can use that lingering 2k NX to buy a Shop Permit (from the Free Market and Accessories tab) for 1.8k NX. This allows you to set up a shop and leave it overnight so that people can buy the goods you get from the Gachapon.

*If above level 150

2) Are you able to traverse the map easily?
*No huge ropes to climb

3) Is the map not in Evolving World or NLC? (Haunted House is alright)
*Evolving World 100% does NOT drop a single box

4) Can you kill the monsters effectively?
*Anything more than 2 attacks to kill is too slow. There's no drop rate bonus if you hunt more difficult monsters

5) Remember that the gold town boxes you click to open do NOT give Empress equipment. Nor will they give out Empress equipment after May 16

P.S. Since there is a 90% chance you're collecting these for Empress equips
*Boxes hoarded prior to May 16 will give out Empress
P.P.S The boxes are purple with a large '8' on them. If you cannot see the color purple

tl;dr version

1) MONSTER SAME LEVEL
2) SUPER EASY FLATMAP
3) NO EVO WORLD U NOOB
3a) I SAID NO EVO WORLD NOOB NO QUESTIONS ASKED
4) OHKO OR YOU FAIL NOOB
5) PRESS 'Z' TO PICK UP PURPLE BOXES
6) TOWN CLICKY CLICKY BOX NO EMPRESS.
6a) HUNT MONSTER LAZY NOOB

P.S. DONT OPEN UNTIL MAY 16 OR YOU WILL DIE A MISERABLE
P.P.S SERIOUSLY DON'T OPEN THEM UNTIL MAY 16
P.P.P.S Unless you want mediocre Maple equipment

Other Tips and Tricks

-The golden clicky clicky boxes in town DO have a small chance of giving out the purple celebration boxes as well. To make this as unconfusing as possible:
Click the box in town -&gt; Open the box it drops -&gt; Small chance of the sexy purple Empress box. Boxception. Kinky.
*Has a limit of 50 a day

-For higher leveled monsters, Lower Clocktower, and even Golden Temple if you're feeling hipster. As always, Future Henesys for the very high leveled. For ultimate hipster, Edelstein has monsters of every tier up to 120.

-If you want to be the ultimate box-collecting machine
*For the absolute manic
**Nexon did not pay me to suggest that

-The boxes will be able to give out Empress weapons and capes. Don't hold your breath for shoulders though

-Remember that the boxes also contain every freaking Maple equip with this event, don't curse the heavens and sell your soul to the devil if you don't get an Empress with the first 10 or so boxes.

-I cannot stress enough that you must wait until May 16th. Possibly longer because Nexon most likely put May 2016.

Why can't I access the Falling Leaves quest?
This is irrelevant, working similar to a party quest.
You know all those quests where that NPC tells you ""If someone is currently in there

1361868773.0,1991aq,My Nostalgic Story.  I want to hear about yours too ,Koraks,23,8,30,"Hey guys

I thought I would share a tale, started a new character this weekend, and quit after I reached lvl 48 in a day.


Here we go... settle down and find a nice comfy spot.


**I** was in middle school, before Scania/Bera/etc. were released).

**My** friends and I would play almost every day during the week and every weekend.  Because I wasn't supposed to play video games during the week, jump onto a rope and heal while my parents were around, rinse and repeat.

**Back then**

**The place** where all the ""high"" level people would go was the Sleepywood Sauna (lvl30+).  Channel 1 Sleepywood regular sauna (not the VIP sauna, play drop games, you name it.  There'd be the occasional or frequent hacker who fly around the sauna would vac-hack dropped items to himself and steal them.  Heck, some of them would use their hacks to hide in the bottom corner of the map and vac items from there.  Haha a lot of us got mad about that back in the day, but looking back, it was a truly memorable time.

**There** was Kernning PQ.  Back then

**Regardless**, it was enjoyable too.  I met so many awesome people in PQs and waiting for PQs.  As a low level 21-25 assassin, no one wanted me in their parties, but occasionally, some nice guy would add me and let me in.  I just remember the first level of the Kernning PQ where you needed to kill like 25-30 strong crocodiles for their passes, and I couldn't hit them for jack damage.  Mages were the only class that could clear this stage quickly because of their ungodly damage in Kernning PQ back then.  It was such an exhilarating feeling getting through the PQ quickly.  I remember that we'd always send one person out of the PQ first to ""check"" and see if the coast was clear.  This person would leave the PQ and check the sewer area of Kernning to see if any other party was waiting to get in.  We'd either make a mad dash to beat them, have the person who left early to give them a track to another channel to get them to leave

**In these times** of Beta and Official Maple, ""B&gt;WIOEURIOEW@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" or ""S&gt;WIOWIEUROWE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@,"" adding as many @ signs to get their speech balloon higher than everyone else.  You would be able to press up in the chat to get your previous message to show up again.  But if you kept spamming your message too quickly, you'd be muted for a short while - in this way, it was almost an art form to effectively/efficiently get your message read by other people in Perion1.  You could make amazing money in Perion1.  Oh a Chas Robe for 100k??  I'll pick that up and resell it.  Steely stars for 8mil??  That's a steal, I'll resell it for 9-10mil (short story: I got my first set of steelys in Kerning City when while waiting for  PQ, someone dropped them.  I guess he wanted to mess around with people by playing a drop game, there'd be times when we would buy up the competition so that we would have the only supply of that particular item.  Then

**There** were certain items that everyone wanted.  All magicians wanted a panlid.  I remember training with my friends in that 1st map to the left of Henesys where there were mushrooms/snails on the lowest level, then green mushrooms at the top.  Only the strongest of us could face those green shrooms.  Either that or a bowman/assassin botting at the straw bales there, shooting their arrows/stars at a safe distance.  If a panlid dropped from a green shroom, you were a millionaire easy.

**When Scania** was first released, have real jobs with families, etc.

**I eventually** got to become a lvl 60ish bandit (I became a bandit once the Beta ended) on Khaini (I quit my Scania character).  I was friends with some people who seem to be big names now - Salleem, edwardxus7, KhainPriest (not a close friend but in the same guild), etc..  There was also SaIIeem (looked like Salleem in game) who was apparently Salleem's brother.  This confused me at first haha.  

**Regardless, Ryanxus7, etc. refused to talk to us and still be friends with us.  I remember edwardxus7 was a good guy and was still our friend, despite what we did.  Regardless, I ended up getting banned at around lvl87 (heck, can't blame anyone but me) as a Chief Bandit in Khaini, while training on those black cat things in Orbis which would drop the tails - forgot their names.  To be honest, giving me that great feeling of leveling up and putting points into new skills while also letting me hang out with my Maple friends and hanging out with them in game.  Once a lot of my Maple friends stopped wanting to be friends with me

**At this point**, because who DOESN'T want a priest to level with?  You got to love Holy Symbol.  I remember leveling up at the Puppet Ghost guys in Ludi before I ended up selling this character and quitting.



**So here** I was this weekend and today.  I reinstalled Maplestory a few days ago and saw there were a million different classes now.  I figured I would look up info on each on Google and decided to create a Dual Blades (I heard they were a great character!).  I was hitting gigantic numbers that I wasn't hitting on my bandit/priest at a ridiculously low level.  I hit level 48 this weekend after only a day and a half of playing!  I felt a pretty hollow feeling when I would level up - no ecstatic feeling of OMG

**None** of my old middle school friends played this time.  I couldn't find college friends to join me - we're all busy seniors trying to find jobs now.  It was just me, level 1xx's, level 8x's, even level 4x's and 5x's in awe as you and your group of friends traveled the seemingly endless Maple world, partied together to feel the sweet feeling of leveling even 1 level after a few long days.  F2'ing each other and congratulating each other for a job well done.  We met lots of awesome people in that game as we performed the same repetitive task each day that somehow retained its magic throughout the years, at least enough to draw me back into the game many, many years later.  We were young back then -  the game has since changed and so have we.  I won't be going back to my new character I made.  Post-Big Bang Maplestory had deviated too much from what it used to be - a game when meeting new friends was just as important as leveling.  I met a lot of great people and am glad I did.  I think this concludes my Maple career

1371714814.0,1gprsg,MapleNostalgia - 8 years of memories,xRonbo,19,4,33,"I'll post some random nostalgia since I have nothing better to do right now and this patch made me realize how much MS has changed (I joined when Khaini was released

- My brother and I once had a plan to kill Golems by using Snail Shell back when it was 100% accuracy. We thought if we collected maybe 100 red snail shells and chucked them at the Golems we'd get like a level per kill

- When I first read about Pico Pico hammer on hiddenstreet (I browsed it for fun lol) I was like ""omg why so low attack and it's super fast attack speed"" and immediately imagined myself killing Zakum by hitting infinite 1s at light speed.

- I used to take screenshots when I saw people over level 50

- My friend (who introduced me to Maple and even had a Mark of the Beta) lent me wooden tops, I've been playing on and off a lot), he was like ""hey you still owe me like 100k for those wooden tops"". He's stopped playing for a while by then, and didn't realize the economy had already changed a lot by 2 or 3 years (I had like 100m at the time and thought I was pretty rich)

- Spending 20 minutes rolling stats to get that beautiful 4/4

- The same friend had introduced me to the game as a Warrior, but I remember thinking about how cool Magic Claw looked)

- Amoria Haircut thing. Gotta get dat Antagonist. I quit one of my higher-leveled mages (and by higher-leveled I mean like 15) because I got that ugly buzz-cut with the Z in it.

- Lucidas (I think that's what they were called) in Amoria and looting mesos and dying a lot

- People dropping things in that Henesys little platform where you couldn't stand that was right outside FM (it was like a little stand). My dream was to get to level 70 on an Assassin to get Flash Jump - I was convinced that I would immediately get rich from being able to loot all those awesome things

- My level 22 main warrior is still trapped in Omega Sector (I just recovered the account a few months ago after it being hacked for like 5 years). I was adventuring in Ludi with my friend (he was level 40) and accidentally died and respawned in Omega instead of Ludi because of how far we'd gone down. I was really sad.

- I played MapleSEA for a while (I lived in Hong Kong for two years because of my dad's job) solely because my friend let me on his level 25 Archer. I thought it was freakin' awesome

- bamboo hats were super cool

- People summoned things in the KPQ area

- people would summon robots and trojan horses in HHG1 to kill us noobs

- Slime tree + vaccers. A lot of hackers in general

- Once

- Sleepywood was a super dangerous place. The sauna was glitched for a while (instant crash), worldmap, etc) and lag it so that you wouldn't immediately D/C, and run over to the portal and get out.

- Warriors had to immediately level their HP skill because it was for every level-up

- People mostly bought NX for looks not wealth

- FM was a scarily crowded place where I dared not enter

- People actually got the Recovery beginner skill because pots rarely dropped from mobs and money was more important than the slight speed of Nimble Feet.

- When I saw my first perfectly scrolled item (+7

- my character names were considerably worse than they are now after millions of new characters have been registered. I use 4-letter names almost exclusively now

- One day

- Screws were a great way to make money but it was hard to get the materials (come to think of it

- I went begging and some rich guy (over level 70!!!!) gave me 100k and I was so happy. I begged a lot from then on but never got much else (maybe like 5k) 


Now for some memories after my long break (this was when Pirates were released

- DG'ing. Oh god the fun (I was TehAran/Noobzwalk in Khaini and my brother was halflifenoob

- Training at Truckers just after Big Bang. So fast.

- I thought Big Bang was amazing and researched it for months before it came to GMS. It was so awesome. I was so happy that I'd finally be able to get past level 30!

- My Night Walker was my first character over level 30 after years of playing

- I had Ilbis for a while and was really proud of them (I would attack randomly in non-mob places just to show them off)

- I really wanted Maple Stars for that special effect

- I thought Bowmen sucked in general because they couldn't shoot at close range

- Once someone dropped Glitter Gloves for fun and lagged out for a second and I got it (this was just during chill time

- I had a good Witch Hat (it was purple glow) and was trying to sell it for money - it was worth approx. 50m back then but would be &lt;10m now in terms of stats. someone offered me 111m and did that trick where you keep retrading and change it to 11m. I cried that day in real life

- My first level 70 was my dual blade. I had the whole dual blade NX set and it was awesome

- I got hacked on my dual blade and lost ~7b worth of stuff in today's economy (8% DEX Unique Specs, 12 Attack PAC with some % stat pot) I quit for a year before coming back to that account - I still had 100m or so in Broa, and that's when I made the move from Khaini to Broa

That's about all I can think of right now. Feel free to post your own memories!

Hey guys

I'd like to give back to Broa after receiving so much from the community

I do have a few simple requirements though: 

* You must have completed the Zakum prequests (for Zakum)
* You must provide an Eye of Fire (for Zakum)
* I prefer not to take those who can solo these bosses easily on their own. 

Now I do not consider myself very strong, but if I have a couple of friends online who are able to do it with me, then we could try Czak. 

If you'd like to do Hilla instead

Here is a list of Skill Books that drop from Zakum and Hilla:

Aran: Combo Barrier, High Defense

Bishop: Angel Ray

Dual Blade: Final Cut

Evan: Dark Fog, Soul Stone

Hero: Advanced Combo Attack

Paladin: Advanced Charge

If you would rather save the time

FAQ: 

**You are literally the greatest person on the planet. Please make love to me** (I get this one a lot)

Oh please. 

**No but seriously. What can I do to repay you?**

I am doing this for free, a fame is appreciated :)

**When the boss drops the items

Yes

**What happens if I die in the middle of a run?**

Sorry, but you will need to provide another Eye of Fire. 

**Should I stay on the rope the entire time

Do whatever you like. I can solo Zakum without problem, hanging on the rope isn't an option, but you can stay to the far side of the map if you wish. 

My IGN is: **BadAsBlades**
My time zone is: PST

From official website:

To address player concerns about an imbalance in EXP gained from some Masteria monsters versus other areas aimed at a similar level range
Monsters inside the Haunted House remain the same levels as before.

Lion King's Castle

To address player concerns about an imbalance in EXP gained in Lion King's Castle versus other areas aimed at a similar level range
The level requirement to enter maps has been removed.
Party Play bonus EXP has been removed.
Monster stats have been adjusted because of the Party Play removal; the monsters are weaker and give EXP that is similar to other monsters in their level range.
The monster respawn rate has been increased.
The use of the Mystic Door skill has been limited.

1371428046.0,1ghf7q,Smaller numbers,GoldExperience,20,6,23,"Hi

With the upcoming patch the damage cap will be raised for 999,000. Just think about that for a second. That is some insane [powercreep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_creep). The value of the numbers are becoming less meaningful. Instead of exponentially increasing how much HP monsters have, it wold be more meaningful to decrease their HP and our damage. Adding more 0s at the end isn't improving the game, its making it more redundant. Soon, you will see numbers 8 digits long fill up the screen. It would be better if instead of increasing the cap by 50x, the cap would be reduced by 10x making the cap 100,000. Monster HP wouldn't have to inflate to match the cap. You would be able to see the improvements in your damage if it goes up a few thousands rather than a few hundred thousands. For those of you thinking, bigger numbers make me feel more powerful"", but inflating numbers isn't going to fix it.

TL;DR
Bigger numbers are redundant,False,self,t5_2rrdo,False,,,t3_1ghf7q

I'm training on my kaiser at LHC (going through that trudge between 155 and 165). I join a party with HS and an open spot, a 136 phantom, isn't doing his job properly. He HSes once every three minutes, and refuses to get off the rope (he's essentially leeching for the service of HS--I'm okay with that) and make sure everyone gets HS. When I ask him to hs (about four to five times), no response, so I say, ""Dammit

So he replies:

Watch your mouth.

So I say that if he isn't doing his job

and he says ""okay"" and leaves the party.

Is it so radical to believe that if you're not attacking and you're only providing HS

When the game began to evolve, bigger better monsters, more levels worth of gear, better party systems, guilds, ways for players to get together and work toward a goal, and a reason for the community to come together other than to trade gear. And they did a great job. I refer to the 'Golden Times' of maple as the era where Ludi PQ, and to a lesser extent Orbis PQ were the dominant ways to level and attain rare scrolls and gear. 

Everything started to fall into an inescapable black hole with the introduction of the Free Market. The economy, therefore, dagger scrolls were expensive. Simple really. When the Free Market released, it allowed the maple equivalent of Wallstreet, and the stock market to emerge. 

People began to buy low and sell high, you got the topscum 'free market kings', and the demand for these obscene prices were only met by other 'free market kings' looking to buy and sell for higher margin. Prices skyrocketed, and they had nothing to do with demand, or rarity of item. 

Wizet then incorporated ""Nexon"" into the Maplestory future. I, but they obviously went with what they saw popular to the community. 

People wanted faster leveling, with gachapon, and harder hitting characters at an easier pace, beginning with Pirates and Cygnus Knights. ""Hit more monsters, for more damage"" seemed to be the motto for the changing climate of Maplestory. Fire/Poison Mages quickly began to decline, along with other ""Single-Target"" classes that couldn't keep pace with the new Over-Powered rivals. As the age of new classes continued, this example was only multiplied, who hit like trucks for characters of their time, but lone behold

And the straw that broke the camels back, hit them lots of times, no single class has not been some variation of that. Mechanics, Battle Mages, Wild Hunters, Demon Hunters, Mercedes, but what do we get? Constant down-time and events that barely make sense. 

Does anyone actually read the quest text from events? Do they even try anymore? As long as they can show you that you'll get a solid amount of Weapon Attack or Magic Attack or % equip from it, hacking, or botting. It's tearing the community farther apart than the days of Ch1 Perion (bottom right corner by the entrance to Sleepywood.), where we were just robots searching among each other for items. 

Obviously I still play the game, and lead maplestory to a new direction. Keeping the awesome quirky, fast-paced 2 &amp; 1/2D feel, but leveling off the playing field and readjusting the usefulness of each class.

That's 1k NX = 50million mesos

5 SSS = 50 million mesos.
Meaning 5 SSS = 1k NX.

Now

Notice it CAN be bundled

I have recently discovered that SSS can be MTS'd!
As I've thought of experimenting this.. I never got the chance until just now.

So.. what you'll simply do is agree with your seller/buyer to trade NX for SSS. 
Buyer puts up amount of SSS equivalent to the price of NX.
Seller purchases SSS and turns in the SSS to Leafre's Chief Tatamo.

I wasn't very social back then. I was always the outcast. The blacksheep, I found Maplestory. I remember picking magician and having a I/L named Gildus.. I stuck with that and I had fun. I found my first friend. My first ever. His username was Marrowdown. A paladin. We both got in a guild called pals for life; Based on the WoW guild. Couple months down the road I was in school when I heard someone talk to a group about Maplestory and this kid said that his username was Marrowdown. I walked up to him at recess and I said ""Hey, Marrowdown, ever heard of the name Gildus?"" he nodded his head and I just fucking BAWLED my eyes out. Having my first ever friend both ingame and out has amazing for me. Marrowdown and Maple taught me to be more social. Soon, I was sitting at the fabled 'cool' kids table with him.

I've seen many points made against this approach

1) *You're censoring the subreddit.* Yup, rules exist. If you're not okay with this, that's fine, but if you're still subscribed to any other subs with banned topics, you're a hypocrite. It's also worth noting that most other Maple forums prohibit the discussion of hacking, it's not like this place is some kind of freak totalitarian state. 

2) *The rules aren't even for anyone's good.* One of the biggest issues this sub has faced is a small userbase. Lack of users means lack of content and community, interesting and engaging. I have no idea what the ""coming soon"" perks are, as I'm not active in-game or in the sub at the moment, but having it exist is certainly a big enough bonus for me.

If you want to talk about hacking, but your posts here are.

-When you get there

http://i.imgur.com/rFwWg.jpg

 She thought you had forgotten all about her. Your character is surprised at how different Sheryl seems from her usual self. She has been looking for a traiter from within the Cross Brigade. She asks for your help with this and she asks you to go talk to Vince for an invitation to see the second ranked Captain of the Cross Brigade

-Vince is surprised about what Sheryl says and he asks you to go defeat Master Harpie for proof of your strength before you can receive the invitation to see Sophia. 

-Upon defeating Master Harpie and returning to Vince, but then she says you're the most important person in the world to her. She then says there's one more thing she wants you to do. She says there's an object called the ""Fragment of Devilishness"" within the Cross Brigade and that you should go back to Vince for more information. 

By the way


-Upon returning to Vince

-When you collect all 100 fragments and return to Vince

-She asks if you've investigated information about the Fragment of Devilishness and seems surprised when she hears about the Tower of Trials. Your guy tells Sheryl about what Vince wants you to do and she gets angry

-You talk to her again and she apologizes and said she said too much. She says to hurry it up and do what she wants and tries using your kindness to get what she wants. She tells you to go ask Vince to give you the final test for the Tower of Trials and she says she must enter that tower at all costs. She calls you her hero after you accept the request. 

Now

-When you talk to Vince

-When you defeat Manon and return to Vince to tell him you've completed the test

-A light bulb quest pops up over your head. The dialog is interesting. ""I've finally obtained the Stamp of the Test Taker. I was able to deceive Vince... no! The entire Cross Brigade. I have my doubts that what I'm doing by Sheryl's request is the right thing to do. No

-Using the lamp, but your guy is like ""Yeah, yeah. I just have one thing to ask you."" Uhhhhhhhhhh... Basically, your guy says recaps that Sheryl is trying to find out who is betraying the Cross Brigade, but then he says that is entirely unlike Sheryl. Sheryl then yells at your guy to shut the hell up and hand her the seal.

-The real Sheryl arrives! Your character is confused; why are there two Sheryls!? The real Sheryl then calls you a moron that never changes and your guy is confused on which one is the real one. The obvious fake one says she's the real one

-Your guy is an idiot. ""This is difficult! Which one of you is the real Sheryl!?"" (It's kind of obvious. ._.) The fake one says

http://i.imgur.com/Am4S5.jpg

-Her name is... uh... Procelphin? Puroserufin... I don't know. Your guy is like

-The evil bitch is like, I'll take Sheryl's form and be by your side forever! Hohohoho! Surely I can entertain you more than the real Sheryl, don't you think?"" 

-Sheryl replies ""Hmm! &lt;Your name&gt; is an idiot

-Your guy : ""Huh? What? Uh... Uh... Hahaha... Of-- Of course!"" *followed by a pissy reaction by Sheryl and your guy getting nervous*

-The bitch : ""Hehe. I guess I have no choice. I'll show you my true power. Your life would have been spared if you had just given me that stamp while you were under my deception. &lt;Your name&gt;

*epic battle that lasts for a whole 5 seconds*

http://i.imgur.com/o8Pin.jpg


-The bitch : ""Ugh... I lost..."" 

-Sheryl : ""For deceiving the Cross Brigade and for your crimes of seduction

*bitch transforms into a stirge*

-Bitch : ""Ohohohoho! Don't think you have won agaist me yet! We will always be somewhere your imagination can't even reach

-Sheryl : ""Puroserufin!"" 

*The Bitch flies away

-Sheryl : ""What could this mean? Even though you're an idiot

-Your guy : ""Eheh... I wouldn't think it wasn't you in my wildest dreams

-Sheryl : ""Wha--what!? Don't say such weird things!"" 

-Your guy : ""S-sorry..."" 

-Sheryl : ""You're an idiot... but I'm glad."" 

-Your guy : ""Huh?"" 

-Sheryl : ""Nothing! By the way

-Your guy : ""What did you say just now?"" 

-Sheryl : ""That vulgar succubus named Puroserufin. She's a member of the most terrifying ""Mugengumi

-Your guy : ""The Black Blooded Demon Brigade? The Mugengumi? N-no. Didn't you say something before you just called me an idiot?"" 

-Sheryl : ""The Black Blooded Demon Brigade is an organization that was created for the sake of going after the Cross Brigade. I've heard that there are many

The succubi of the Mugengumi aim to infiltrate the Cross Brigade and seduce members into betraying their own so they can cause all kinds of bad things. It is the same case for Gerect from before.

It seems this time, they will try to deceive a Cross Brigade member again in order to get the stamp.

If you wait a while, with that stamp you hold, you should participate in the Tower of Trials when it opens. Together, we shall eliminate all of those obnoxious succubi!

Well, it'll be a little lonely, but we must split up again. Farewell!"" 

-Your guy : ""What was it you said before?!"" 

*Sheryl disappears*

-Your guy : ""You wouldn't answer me in the end. The Tower of Trials, that succubus, Procelphin, and everyone else again there. Well then, I guess I must do my best to train until then!""
