I met with two guys

After the presentation they immediately started asking what I saw as a possible way we could work together.  This is where I took reddits advice.  I mentioned how we've licensed our tech before but didn't mention anything much or anything else.  Then they started throwing out all the different ways they saw us working together.  They asked to sign an NDA before our next meeting and they want to meet in person.  I'm so pumped right now but being cautious.  Thanks for all the insight from you guys

edit: I should also note I kept it laid back and comfortable.  I had met one of the guys before at a conference last year so we were able to remember that and talk like friends pretty much.  Talked about golfing

I did a podcast with a friend and he found my story to be interesting. It's not the typical ""I worked really hard and went through some hard times and now I'm an awesome smart traction attracting bad ass"". It's more of the ""Hey! I'll work really hard and still fail but each time I've learned something extremely valuable but I'm not rich yet"" 

I think this is a good time in my life to discuss what I've learned and what I wish to learn in the near future. 

I'm not a fan of ""stealth mode"" so I'll gladly answer any questions you have on any subject. Every time I've reflected I've found myself growing.

My full story:
I started a tshirt line with a co-worker when I was 21. Our first year we had 30k in sales (about 40% profit). During that time I opened my first business credit card. The banker told me that my partner had bad credit and I should be careful. During the year we ran the company he ran up my credit card to 15k (mostly withdrawing cash to buy lunch). He also pulled out cash to pay photographers/models etc. Eventually we added a third partner (another close friend) which the third person instantly made me realize my first partner was ""Bad"" (to be clear he's not a evil person he was just very irresponsible).

Failure #1

The tshirt line eventually tanked probably because my first partner had a vision for the brand and I had another. When he left I tried to change the brand and it failed with our customers. With all the drama and stress from the debt I decided to quit. 


I took a job at a denim company. The CEO hired over the phone and promised ""If you make my company grow I'll invest any company you want to start"". I was the first employee and I help grow this company from 100k a year to 6M over the next 5.5 years. I was a Creative Director and I handled everything from design to marketing creative. I also created the story/brand/imagery. 

Failure #2
During our growth period my CEO told me ""Are you ready to start your own line?"". I called a designer and my good friend from the last company (the one who gave me insight about my first partner). At this time he was in Shanghai so we had a perfect operation. 1 man in shanghai doing production

Failure #3
The denim company eventually folded because the CEO really wanted to spend millions on marketing (pretty much every national women's magazine you can imagine). It's not truly her fault. The pressure to spend so much came from our customers (every national department store America from Nordstroms to Fifth Saks). That's a long story itself. 

Actual Success!
A few months before the company folded I started playing poker and became interested in it. Ran hot and won about 7k playing 5/5 at the casino. One day I met a really young player at the casino who was really talented (everybody was freaking terrible). He eventually became my coach and backer. The next 3 months I made enough money from him staking me to being able to bankroll myself. I played 150 hours a month and read about 15 hours a month. This was mostly live poker. I did this for about 1 year and 3 months. Great experience.

Failure#3.5
Through a friend's referral I got a huge web project that would pay the bills for 3 months. I stopped playing poker because I realized there were easier ways to make a living. My partner who lived in Shanghai has a strong tech background so we started two companies in Shanghai. We made a chatting app and a cloud sharing service (very similar to dropbox but focus being China).  The chatting app space is way too competitive and we didn't build a very compelling product. To be clear I only help build these in the beginning. The day to day is ran by my buddy in Shanghai

The cloud storage is currently still going and gaining a lot of traction. We've raised a significant amount of money for it. I can't say how much but it's enough to hire 10 employees. If i wanted to focus full-time on this I would have to move to Shanghai and take a huge pay cut. I decided to stay in the US until a little later. As always my good friend would always be there.

I eventually took a job as a Art Director at a Digital advertising company that focused on Mobile applications. I thought this was be a great chance for me expand my skill set. I started as a creative but eventually focused more on product management. I left that company and now currently work at a very big tech company as a Product Manager. Apparently all my failed apps gave me a lot street fred.

Current day:

I'm making something to help restaurants improve their customer service and teach them more about their customers. I started this because I'm a huge foodie and it gives me a chance to meet a bunch of awesome chefs.

Well that's it…….not sleeping on millions of dollars or swimming on a plane ending. I'm a pretty open guy feel free to ask me anything. I'm not smart

And if you're so kind please follow my companies me Twitter!

For launch day I had them post banners with imagery of our products,000 unique visits, resulting into some good sales numbers. That’s a pretty huge ROI for a small investment http://i.imgur.com/FUsIBd0.jpg

I would definitely suggest marketing on Instragram because there is a lot of potential to run an inexpensive and effective campaign. Here are some tips:

* Don’t just post on any account with a lot of followers... find the ones that your target customers are following. I tried a sponsored post on a meme account and got mostly negative comments from their pre-teen followers.
* Make sure your pics are visually appealing and don’t look too much like an ad. One of our most successful posts was a model holding one of our products in a natural setting
* Add your company’s username in the caption so users can follow your account. So far we have over 5
* Make sure your site is responsive and mobile friendly. This is obviously very important nowadays but especially for marketing on IG.

I've personally built a portfolio of business from scratch to over $900k recurring revenue, every month, so those are my creds and I feel like I have a decent perspective.

I've been leaving start-up feedback and critiques for a bit now and almost always end up leaving some useful SEO tips. I figured it would be great to put together a guide for those who may want some real-world SEO tips

A little background on myself

First off, every little bit you can do to position yourself to be setup for success you should do!

- I've found there are two types of websites. A website may either provide a personal utility or offer services. Another is a content website where SEO is something that can offer you a huge boost from. Content websites allow you to literally build up a database and have hundreds to hundreds of thousands of pages of content to. Even if you are only getting 1-5 page views per day,000 to 250k page views a day (1-5 views per page, per day). Product and service websites can still most definitely benefit from these tips though.

- Domain name has gotten a little less important over the years but is still something that can greatly assist you. If you are able to get a domain name that can be part of a main search term on your website

- Going on that a bit further, the url would be 'domain.com/show/8-Real-True-Blood'. Since the ID of the show is 8, extract that from the URL and make sure to detect if 'True-Blood' matches 'Real True Blood'. If it doesn't, issue a permanently moved HTTP header.

- Make sure you use &lt;h1&gt; tags! These are meant to show the main definition of your page. If you can tailor it to a search engine term great

- Use targeted &lt;title&gt; tags. Make sure they match your page content without being too lengthy. You *can* use your website name in the title tag

- If you can have text that is in your h1, that is **exactly** what you want and you're hugely ahead in terms of *really* letting Google know what the page is about. Follow up on this by having 1-3 (I've found at least 2) images on the page that are directly related to that text. 
- - For example

If you can do the previous suggestions, URL, and supporting images targeted to exactly what your page is about. This gives the search engines a huge confidence in what your page is about and even though you may be a new site you can start getting some traffic.

- Go further and use H2 tags for supporting information on the page. H2 tags could be 'True Blood Cast'

I've used the previous simple SEO tips to get a decent amount of traffic in the past. On a 3

**Some tips/tricks:**

- Really do try to avoid completely re-writing your website code from scratch. Google sees this and becomes a bit wary losing confidence in your code. They're not quite sure if it will change again soon, and if they're not confident that your page *will* be the same as it was when they first started sending users they will throttle you until that confidence has returned.
 
I learned this lesson the hard way when I re-wrote my website and my traffic reduced to around 40-50%. It was vastly improved from the previous re-write but it took around 6 months for the traffic to return to normal levels. I stupidly re-wrote it again a year later with the same traffic results and it regained its traffic even slower. I'd bet my life that if I never re-wrote it, and no permanent forwards were created.

**Please Note:** If your site is a top site like Reddit or you are getting millions of page views a month

- Don't count out the importance of images. If you SEO them correctly as in my previous examples you can garnish a large amount of Google Images traffic. Not all of it converts

- Inbound links to your website (that do not have nofollow on them) are extremely important. What I've found however is that if you push super hard in this area

Those are the fundamentals that I follow when building out a website. There are so many best practices out there for this type of thing but I've found these suggestions were the most integral and rewarding.

__3. Paid Apps__  
1) The user pays upfront for the full app
2) It has been shown that price and revenue do not always correlate precisely and you should experiment with various price points. Anchor it with the highest price point and put it on various levels of discount to test out sales.  

__4. In App Purchase (IAP) Approaches__  
1) Currency - Have a virtual currency used to buy boosters and perform other actions. The user can earn currency in-game or purchase more via IAP for faster results. Examples: Farmville's currency  
2) Energy - The user gets a certain amount of actions per energy
3) Unlocking Features - Have premium features such as extra levels or assistance unlockable via IAP. Examples: Angry Birds's Eagle  
4) Chips - Another take on currency
5) Freemium - Similar to unlocking features
6) Subscription - Covered in section 5
  
__5. Subscription__  
1) Live Data Feed - Have the user pay a monthly fee in return for up to date data (Newspaper subscriptions
2) Pay Per Data Usage - Have the user pay a recurring fee depending on how much they use. Examples: Dropbox  
3) Software As a Service - Pay for usage of the software as-you-go. I haven't seen a full SAAS mobile app yet but I think TaskRabbit is a close example. Examples: [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)  
   
__6. Facebook__

__8. Email Lists__  
1) Promote Paid Products - Get paid on traffic/conversion or promote your own paid products  
2) Drive Traffic to a Website for Conversions/Ad revenue

Here's the idea.  Replace the SAT with a computerized adaptive test (CAT).  You can read more about CAT here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing, they get harder, and vice versa.  It is used in all kinds of professional certifications.

With CAT

So there's your idea.  You just have to execute it.  All you have to do is convince 1000's of colleges and millions of students that this is a better way to do testing.  It is a better way, personnel, etc.  Once the SAT wall is cracked, other competitors may come in as well, so you need to deal with them too.

So how much is anyone willing to pay me for this idea?  It can definitely build a $100M business


If you aren't willing to pay me anything, is worth anything?  My idea has a guaranteed $100M market.

[Edit: I guess it isn't obvious.  **I'm not serious about being paid for this idea.  This is meant to prove a point about how ideas have no value with execution.**  I actually do think this is a good idea

Even though I did not get the support of the university, I shrugged this incident off. We decided to revamp the website for this fall's new school year. I messaged a few clubs at depaul and managed to recruit them to the site. The students were very receptive as well as the clubs that I managed to talk to.

I decided that the best place to recruit organizations to the website was at my school's involvement fair. After talking to a few organizations, through emails and facebook messages.

1374419418.0,1ir3ny,What is your typical dev process?,Deathspiral222,77,11,23,"We are an early-stage

I thought it would be interesting to share exactly how we build new features

We're building price guides and tools for niche markets

We are geographically distributed

We're making some money but nothing special - after all bills (including contractor) are paid

In terms of a tech stack

How we build new stuff:

1. We have a high-level roadmap of the key features we want to add. Initially, Google Drive (+ dropbox) for sharing them and we use the google apps for single sign on for other applications (e.g. our bug tracker). I'd suggest doing something similar since it makes it easy to remove access from, say, a contractor if things don't work out.

2. We use JIRA for bug tracking with the GreenHopper plugin for managing sprints. We're using a hosted JIRA at a cost of $20/month. Ultimately

We have 2 sprints a month - 15 days each.  

3. We use Splunk Storm

4. We use uservoice.com for ticket tracking and feature requests. It's free (for now) and truly excellent. We're planning on upgrading soon. Customers can vote on new features and suggest new ones and we typically make a decision on a feature that was not on our roadmap after 100 votes. Tickets can be turned into JIRA bugs and added to the backlog for later prioritization.

5.  we use qualaroo.com for pop-up surveys. We paid for a year at $550 just recently and we like it a lot. We use surveys for lots of things - right now

6. We use google analytics and Kissmetrics to track metrics. Generally

7. Speaking of email

8. Anyway, as does having a single shared screen.

Everyone has committed to 12 hours per week at a minimum so we usually add 24 hours of work per sprint for each person. Typically this gets exceeded once we start working since a critical bug or user request always seems to come up halfway through the sprint.

Eventually (usually after 30 minutes) we have a new sprint ready to go with the most important work to be done for the next two weeks. We prioritize the tasks for each person and start the sprint.

9. We use Odesk for managing our contractor in the Ukraine. He is awesome. One trick for odesk - contact people directly

10. Once everyone has their work

11. We use Jenkins as a continuous build server. Our Jenkins server runs on an EC2 instance that was very fast to set up thanks to a Bitnami pre-compiled instance. The CI server ensures that all unit tests are run when code is checked in

12. We deploy nightly from Jenkins to a staging server that has ""production-like"" data on it. It's as close to production as we can get it.

13. We're planning on using Sauce Labs for automated browser testing of our staging server. Night now

14. We try to write Junit tests for each new feature or bugfix to catch future errors or regressions quickly.

There is much more than this but I think that's enough for now. Any questions?

How do you guys build your software?

Looking closer at this issue, and per Reddits own rules any mod that is inactive for over a month is considered a inactive mod anyway.

My standard for activity is simple: Did a mod post at least ONCE in /r/startups in the last 6 months?

The mods currently listed:

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/kevin143 - 	I went back as far as 6 months through his comment history

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/reeksofhavoc - Posts all the time in /r/Entrepreneur and /r/frugal but hasn't been here in forever

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/jedberg - Is apparently an alt account of a now ex-admin who no longer works at Reddit..but still has not posted here on months

* **Inactive Mod that has now replied to this thread:** /u/chime - Last posted in /r/startups over 2 months ago

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/ohashi - Page no longer exists when I check in chrome  so I can only assume he is inactive on every reddit.

* **Inactive Mod:**  /u/Ingenium13 - Hasn't even posted on reddit in over a month.  Spent most of his time in /r/bitcoin and /r/tasker and /r/drugs the last few months before that. Hasnt posted in /r/startups in many months

* **Inactive Mod that has now replied to this thread:** /u/Xenophon1 	- Spends most of his time in /r/Futurology since he is also a mod there

* *Active Mod*: /u/PLURFellow - Last active on /r/startups 2 days ago according to his comment history.

* *Possibly Active Mod*: /u/ragmondo - spends most of his time in /r/bitcoin and /r/music these days


Reddt rules state that mods must be active every **30** days or so at minimal to keep their roles; This was how the /r/athiesm mod got kicked so we **know** this is the rule as other long standing mods have been removed for inactivity before.  Thus if these mods are not more active soon

**I hereby request the following:**

* All mods who have been inactive for more than 6 months (thats most of them) be removed.
* I would like to humbly request to be a mod if nobody else can be found, so my efforts would be to find a replacement asap.
* I want you to tell me what you would do to make this reddit better
* It is my personal belief based on the data in front of me that that since so many of these inactive mods like the same reddits - the cluster around /r/bitcoin usage - the possibility exists statistically that some of them are alt accounts for the same person. If this is the case I respectfully ask that they be removed as that's not fair to everybody else.

**Edit:** Thanks to this thread we now have a new sidebar as the mods try to look busy

**Edit:** I have updated this thread to reflect the fact that out if the large list of people in the /r/startups mod list only 2 people on the list of mods have even responded.

**Edit:** I only posted this after not getting a response from the mods after sending them multiple messages and even offering to get on skype with them as a group.  My offer to chat with them on skype has been ignored

**Edit:** By my simple and very low bar for activity that I set above ""Has the mod posted at least once in the last 6 months"" I myself am more active than all of the mods combined.

**Edit:** Thank you for your upvotes and support

I'm done with this thread, power hungry mods that have captured this reddit that never post because they themselves have no startup experience and are not qualified to be mods in /r/startups

Click here to learn something new every day."" The last sentence links to Now I Know's landing page, and occasionally, a post will have a link to a relevant Now I Know issue.

In two weeks, with 1,000 or so coming in the last seven days. About half went to my landing pages, and it looks like 15% or so are converting, maybe 20%, but regardless, that's pretty typical for a vague endorsement. In any event

I just had to write this down because I'm frankly incredibly frustrated by the unprofessional and terrible hiring process I just went through with Trulia.

The first step to ensure a truly terrible hiring experience is to fire your recruiter and then fail to inform anyone she was in the process of recruiting for a month. Following that

Then, but that there was a meeting that day and they decided that they're no longer hiring for that position.

I'm really frustrated with the complete lack of professionalism Trulia has shown in this matter. Frankly

I don't have any experience or research to argue any of that

I noticed this subreddit doesn't have a linked sticky in the side bar like the other subreddits

Here it goes

**First topic: the Founder Institute and other pre-incubators are not worth it:**

TL;DR: I was accepted to the Founder Institute, the majority of times, in the heart of a fool+ reasons and sources.

I got accepted early in February a day after I took the the test, how you can do this part-time without quitting your job (yeah; right), and how you'll have time to take out investors to dinners / events to build a bond, they are huge on repeating these things. All of this without mentioning anything important, all fluff- as I say. Disguising really important stuff with fluff and with certain [confidence tricks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_confidence_tricks) classified this to me as a con for hopeless fools. Yes some will get a kick with the media with this, but where are the companies that aren't D startups that graduated from the Founder Institute? Even then you can use the ~$3000 (assuming you have a 3 person team) on advertising and a trade show.

Keep in mind all of their investors are owners of mediocre sites (search for yourself). The Founder Institute does exactly what a local college business / marketing development / alumni center does while giving you ""expert mentoring"" (as they say), with some other exceptions, at a loss:

You cannot incorporate without being on terms consistent with those provided by the Founder Institute

You can try the first 14 days while having the chance to get a refund,500 per team member (if you raise more than $50,000 and make a product in 24 months), forced to give up a 3.5% [warrant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_%28finance%29) as Class F stock of whatever you will raise for the next 10 years and also forced to join a bonus pool, with the people in your class, that you only get a 30% return on.

I assumed the following scenario and got turned off myself

A month passes and your 3 person team has gotten a rough product out. You've already invested $50/each for the tests, time invested, special incorporation fees that god knows how much it costs because it's under the Founder Institute's terms, and other miscellaneous things like gas, food, events, and dinners for the investors. We're at a hypothetical $2850 from JUST the FI fees right now without considering incorporation and what I mentioned earlier. 

An Angel Investor who,000. $5,250 is going to the pool, $1575 is returned to the team, and each member has to pay $4,500 for the tuition since you just raised more than $50,000. Suddenly $150,500. 

At first it seems ok,951,000 but it's all for the company- you brush it off and are in denial.

Lets keep repeating this and lets say you raise B at 5M in 1 year, and since it's a warrant they will get valued at the highest amount that's possible. You just gave up a huge chunk of possible company money you could have been using regardless if I messed up on some calculations or assumptions. 

They fell off the map because people can see through them. They ask for too much, institutes are still opening world wide! 

There are already niche focused startup accelerators you just have to do the research

If I forgot something

Besides all of this, events, meetups, hackathons you'll need to know and go to- in real life. If you ever need more advise, you can save money and not attend a pre-incubator and pay a lawyer, an accountant, and a technical consultant / specialized field consultant to suggest the next steps and still save more money down the road. From there either learn how to code or save some more capital if it's a brick and mortar / hardware business.

I'm wondering what's your response to all of this? Did it help? Am I underestimating pre-incubators? Is the Internet NOT the best resource you can get!?

Just look at all this FREE curated content! You're standing on the shoulder of the Internet! It can take a bit of work but you don't NEED to go to a pre-incubator type entity or do you? If you disagree,False,,t5_2qh26,1376174835.0,,,t3_1eyhqw

A few years ago at a linux conference a bright young kid (who unbeknownst to me was actually 28 at that point) approaches me because I'm the only other guy there who kind of looks like I'm from his tribe. He's shy, backwards town with a very shitty family, his emotional growth was clearly stunted and he eventually decided that he needed to become his own role model.

Over the following months our friendship grew and I began mentoring him. He was an electronics and software geek, running some manufacturing control systems. My father helped design the theories which these systems were based on, and I started considering this kid as my own son.

After a few months he revealed his life story, the ambivalent step-fathers who came in and out of his life. Then he dropped the bomb that he was a registered sex-offender and he was nervous he could never get a job.

His story was very misfortunate. At the age of 17 he made the wrong decision and slept with his 15-year old step-sister. A year later, and threatened to have him arrested.

My friend, a mistake which has haunted him for 12 years now. he showed me his transcripts and sentencing paperwork because he earnestly didn't want me to shun him. How could I?

This year he is finishing up his degree with a 4.0 average. I've mentored him in various scripting languages and automation-platforms like Chef and Puppet. He's very competent

As you might guess

With a few years of experience, he is shit out of luck. I've promised him he'll make it, and I intend to meet that promise even if I need to start a business with the sole purpose of making sure he is employed.

Any suggestions?

About a couple months back, even our price beat neighboring competitors who didn't offer as much as us. The point was to show everyone that we were not only cheaper

Well, when I started yelping myself. Never became an elite but several friends have. I told her that I knew Yelp was a valuable tool but I felt like we weren't ready to start advertising with them since I hadn't hired enough quality therapists yet to start promoting big. She said she'd call me back in a week and touch base. During the call, she explained how there were 19 other active massage/reflexology businesses on Yelp within 5 miles and how I needed Yelp in order for an upper hand against these 19 other choices. I checked on Yelp and there were only about 6 competitors, only 2 had reviews for them. I thought it was weird, but thought nothing of it.

Last night, but never found the customer. The profile for the review was created within the same hour the review was posted and there was nothing else filled out on the profile, just a picture that looks like it could've been pulled off of anywhere (instagram? even reddit). I replied the best I could, but I thought it was highly suspicious how an account could be created, a negative review written and it becomes a permanent review as opposed as a ""filtered"" review. My past experiences doing web reputation for companies has taught me that creating an account on Yelp and writing any review right away would automatically flag it as ""filtered"" until you prove yourself otherwise that you're not spam through more reviews, check-ins, etc. This profile

I've flagged the comment, nothing has happened and it's gotten me really upset. Does anyone know what to do in this situation? Any suggestions?

I decided to build istorical.com to try to foster a community where you can find out everything you’d ever want to know about what it’s like to live in Barcelona, or wherever else you dream of. You can view and discuss videos, and read and post answers to questions about what the local people are like, the cost of living, things to do there, local culture, nightlife, unsafe areas

As of today,540 cities, 154 videos, and more than 95,000 questions begging to be answered. I’m building this alone, and it’s been extremely rewarding and educational, but also incredibly challenging for me to get even friends and acquaintances to post on the site. If you answered even a few questions about what life is like in your city or country, I would be incredibly grateful.

1359751713.0,17pr87,email from Jason Calacanis about Jody Sherman's death.,cafeinatedd,55,6,5,"A very popular founder named Jody Sherman died this week. He was the founder of Ecomom

We weren't close friends, as he was a human router who left an impression.  

But he didn't just die

And it seems like folks are not ready to talk about that issue just yet. Which I can understand. My friend Sarah Lacy wrote a couple of days ago that she didn't want to speculate on his cause of death, and his tragic suicide.

I don't want to draw any conclusions either, and Jody was 47. All far too young. 

While we don't know the exact histories of each of these individuals

And we do know all were under massive pressure

Ilya's mother reportedly said

Let's pause on that for a second. 

Perhaps we owe it to these three amazing humans to examine if the pressures of being a founder

I've always believed that being a founder is an unhealthy pursuit at times

Startups are a full-contact sport. This is a good time for all of us to pause and think about why we're doing this. And the impact it's having on us and the people around us. 

I'm not an expert on suicide, I'm certain 10 more didn't. 

Could these deaths have been avoided? Perhaps. 

Is it worth exploring why this happens and if it is

At the very least

On that measure Jody was a tremendous success.

- I am fully aware that everything i know or thought i knew is and was wrong. Looking back on things… We fk'd up. 
- I tried to lay out our situation and how we got here in hopes you could help us fix things.
- I apologize for the length of this post.

Last year, they would use it. (20+ SMALL business owners)

I decided to get other people involved and form a company to build such a solution. We worked in our free time for about 3 months before it became obvious that such an endeavor would be full time. The other 3 people i was working with were brought on full time with a $25k investment from a wealthy family friend who believed in us.

We all started woking full time. Our salaries were based on our monthly expenses; We took exactly what we needed each month. Just enough to exist.

During the next 4 months we:
	- Finalized design mockups
	- Wrote product specification
	- Incorporated
	- Brought on a CFO (for equity) and gained an extremely well respected technical advisor.
	- Wrote and re-wrote a business plan many times
	- Launched a landing page
	- Communicated with those who signed up to improved the product based on their wishes / needs.

Around 6 months in we started to pitch investors. Former clients

We weren't able to raise a single dime.

Perhaps our biggest mistake was not sitting down and actually building the product. We figured that if we did EVERYTHING ELSE, and 9 months of build time later, boom, success. We couldn't build the product without money (only 1.5 of us are developers), we couldn't get money without the product.

Around month 7 we got accepted into a new accelerator program. We were their first company. After speaking with them, drastically (we thought). Our projected build time was approx 6 months without hiring anyone. 

Still too big. We slimmed it down even more and chose a very specific market to target. We did some basic market research and found it to be about $140MM/year. We were then told this market is too small and we knew of several large competitors in the space already. Several mature startups as well.

Back to the drawing board.

After re-evaluating what it was we were doing this for anyway, got feedback and a few signups without paying a dime. This was done to prove that someone might want the product.

We were actively and had the ability to build it ourselves within about 2 months.

About 2 weeks in

Now we're stuck

We've spent the last 2 days or so brainstorming different products and ideas. We've made a list and done a bit of research on each only to find that the market for most of them is already overrun or that what we want to do flat out already exists.

- It seems like it's impossible to have a ""new idea"" outside of the biotech / energy fields. (This can't be true

- Anything we've come up with based on peoples pain there is already a solution for

- We spent many months without an advisor familiar with startups or how to build one. We have these things now

- TechCrunch is not the real world. Reading it makes one think good things just happen. We're missing something

- We tried to apply our own logic and version of what we THOUGHT was the right thing to do. It was all wrong.

Sooo... as of this moment

Has anyone been in a situation like this? What should we do / be doing?

The business is an online service and it can cater for international customers. It sells licences to use the service each year and also there's opportunity for selling an additional per hour service to integrate functionality from my site into customer's websites with my site's API. That's all the details I'll go into for now. Let's just say it's brand new, easy to use and pretty comprehensive in terms of features I've envisioned for it. It's basically finished, I have a minimum viable product, it's tested and ready to go pretty much. In fact it's been live for several months now but I haven't been actively selling or marketing it as I've been polishing up a few things and not really a sales person. I have had about 100 randoms sign up and try the site, basically from finding it on Google. Also a local organisation that I approached was keen to sign up and use it. But I just haven't had time to do much sales/marketing work myself so I kinda need a decent sales person working on it.

Anyway, then he can really push it. Now we're at negotiation stage and I'm wondering how I value the company to make it fair for him to buy in. He wants to initially buy in at 5%. To be honest he could be quite useful to have on board and use him almost as a business partner. He's already had some good ideas for the site to make it easier to use and improve accessibility.

Ok so a few numbers high level ballpark style. I estimate I've done approximately 4000 hours on developing it to get the site to it's current state, company registered, trademarks registered etc. I effectively own 100% of the company.

So I came at it from that angle and said:

$400K commercial value

Adjust for risk (50%) as new venture

5% share buy in = $10K.

I thought it was reasonable but I'm not sure the best way to approach it. He came at it from the angle as an investor. And his thinking was sales are unproven. Product is really good, much higher than other people with similar experience. So he came back with:

Company valuation = $20K

5% share buy in = $1K.

I wasn't particularly liking my 4000 hours (2 years) of effort being only worth $20K so we talked a bit more and realised it is really hard to value the company. His last offer was:

5% share buy in = $2.5K

Then sales targets of the following (meaning if the company makes this much money per year

1) $7000 per year = Another 5% shares

2) $20

3) $50

4) $120

That would total 25% shares. So tomorrow I'll need to think about making a counter offer. Any opinion/ideas what that would/should be? Or should I walk away from the deal? 

My preference would be just have a commission only sales guy driving the sales. But I also think it would be good to have him on board as a parter in the business. And we have talked about starting a business together in earlier times but that was more of a consultancy based business. It turns out I've already started my own business since then and just need to do the sales / marketing side now and get it out there. But I'd prefer to stay doing the management/CEO stuff and development as for me development is free. It's just time.

What's the best way to value my company? And also give him an option to buy some shares. My concern is he's getting a rather large stake in the company for pretty cheap. He thinks the opposite and that it's a risky investment. He also could be playing it cool and making it seem like he has a pessimistic outlook so he can buy in for cheap. Thing is I don't think he'd be making an offer if he didn't think it had value. I'm ready to take it or leave it. I can realistically just do sales myself if I have to. The costs to keep running the business are like $40 a month so it's not breaking the bank.

So... any ideas? Many thanks.",,t5_2qh26,1358795437.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/16ze81/im_a_ceo_dev_and_ive_built_the_service_and_its/

Our goal is to provide quality lessons for drummers at a reasonable price. We have been working on this project for a year now and have only a handful of subscribers. I am hoping the amazing readers of this subreddit can point us in the right direction because we feel as though we should be successful and we well...we aren't.

Here is what we have done so far:

1.Created 100's of video lessons

2.Built yourmusicmuse.com and the member area complete with blog, progress meters, and various other tools.

3.Advertised with google adwords and have spent close to $1

4.Advertised on some major drumming websites with a similar roi

5.Created a blog and post once or twice a week

6.Concentrated on SEO and moved our homepage almost to page 1 for ""online drum lessons""

7.Contracted a famous drummer (Jeremy Hummel-Breaking Benjamin) to shoot 17 lessons

I am laying this all out there for people. We have so much time and money wrapped up in this and we do everything except teach the lessons. If there is anything you can see that might be hindering our success please post even if it eviscerates our egos or you just think we should call it a day.

I was just taking a brain-break after a long night of studying back in October, and began to think a bit more.  I emailed my close friend (and now partner) to tell him and get his opinion.  He loved it and kept repeating to himself, ""holy shit...holy shit...""

We spent the next 6 months emailing, friends, coworkers, friends of friends, ""some guy"" that someone knew, etc.  We worked our way through software company reps, to VCs, and at the end of it all

That was until two nights ago.

I got a call from my partner

He told me that the incubator group/seed fund that we'd got in touch with 1-2 months ago had finally gotten back to us after reviewing the idea.  They're giving us office space, since they're an incubator.  

This program starts in June.  My partner is brilliant and doesn't feel the need to go to college this year (he'll be attending UChicago in 2013 though) but I will be attending college since I got into the b-school at a pretty highly ranked school.  We're getting a partnership written up which will include how much % of the company each of us owns (the partners are me, many connections in the business world).

The incubator told us that by mid-June, and my friend seems to be confident about writing up the plan.

What should we be focusing on now? In a month? In 6 months? In a year? Where should we be aiming to be? What should our goals be? What are some things that may unexpectedly happen? What are some things we should look out for?

Quick rant on a problem I see far too often in the startup community. Startups take a decent idea, and then pivot or start something else. This is then generally accepted as ""it's been done before, and it failed"", as if the idea itself failed - when the fact is that the piss-poor execution failed. 

This is why I look negatively at MVPs and landing pages for non-existent products. While theoretically a smart way to gauge interest or spend the least amount of time failing, spoiled, ADD execution. If you know you're solving a problem, stick with it and iterate until it people like it. 

So next time someone tells you ""x has been done before many times

I am  engaged in a transaction on Escrow.com where I am selling a website to a buyer. This buyer wrote the description of the transaction as follows:

""Sale of www.""his web site"".net including all files, email lists, facebook &amp; twitter accounts, 60 day support period.""

That is the extent of our agreement

So he sent his money to Escrow.com, and he has received passwords or admin access to multiple accounts such as email, Facebook, and Twitter. All of these items are complete, and I have emails reflecting that he acknowledges receiving everything.

Now, but at the time he changed his mind. Now, during the course of this transaction, he has never asked about traffic until the very end after getting everything from me. Traffic has declined since December from about 500 visits/day to 250-300 visits/day and he is claiming that the decline in traffic is grounds to terminate the transaction.

My main question is: Does he have a case? If this goes to arbitration at a website such as American Arbitration Association, what are my chances of winning?

Thanks a lot

I'm launching all this under my real name. I'm a long-time Redditor

The open-source system is called [the Mixologist](https://github.com/librarymixer/The-Mixologist). The website that it works with is called [LibraryMixer](http://librarymixer.com).

Many have tried before to create software that builds darknets (decentralized

I've designed a hybrid system where basic, while all of the communications and file transfers over the Mixologist are direct, encrypted P2P connections and still fully decentralized and private.

The real benefits emerge when you add reviews and lists of what you have or want on Librarymixer, but how you should find the wheat among the chaff. When used together, LibraryMixer and the Mixologist offer the integrated experience of recommending music or videos or books to your friends via your reviews, and if they're interested, the ability to immediately ask to get those from you using the Mixologist via a single click on LibraryMixer.

It's also possible to just drag-and-drop entire folders on your computer into the Mixologist, LibraryMixer itself is a fully functional, independent website, and you don't even have to install or use the Mixologist at all.

Unlike past P2P file sharing services that have realistically only had minimal non-copyright infringing uses, responding with automatic messages (think: ""Got your request, will bring it next time I see you.""), privately browsing and downloading from your friends' personal collections such as their photos, etc. In this sense, like GMail or instant messengers that are neutral tools, it makes it possible to treat users as adults and place the responsibility of staying within legal limits on the users of the tool. In other words, the VCR had the capacity to record ten thousand copies of that Blockbuster video tape you rented

I'm hoping for a small group of volunteers to help test this before I launch. I'm posting here because it would be great to round up a few tech-savvy Redditors willing to add each other as friends on LibraryMixer and also willing to use the Mixologist for a week or so to give me some honest

I currently work for a startup that's not quite a startup anymore. Since joining I've seen the company grow from 5 people to 70+

I feel apprehensive about it though. I'm young, I work on an interesting product. Why would I want to jump ship? Well, it's not all roses and rainbows.

**moderator participation**

The mods aren't some uniform group that even talks that much between themselves.  As far as I can tell

So when you complain about the mods

**content / spam**

There have been a few posts about blogspam filling this subreddit up.  Crappy content sucks.  I agree.  However

""*Please submit stories to any good startup stories

That is very wide open and hard to enforce any hard rules about what type of content gets submitted as its very subjective.

However, an amazingly powerful tool.  You can upvote and downvote the good and the bad.  If you don't like a certain type of content, downvote it.  if the majority of users agree on what they do and don't like the quality will go up (at least for those in the average in terms of what they like).

This requires effort.  Every subreddit has the same issue

You can also improve the quality of this subreddit by submitting good content.  Find and submit good relevant content.

As it stands those are the two options to improve the content here without any rule changes.  

**Participation / communication**

Startups are a labor of love and evoke some very strong emotions.  I am tired of seeing reports about users harassing one another and complaining about being downvoted/reported as spam/rude.  A lot of people here are very frank and may offend with their opinions.  If you feel offended don't start a flamewar and complain about it later. Thank them and move along to better things.

Some people are just assholes, they are everywhere.  If you can't handle them, ignore them and move on.  No sense wasting your time.

As a moderator

For the commenters, some people don't really want your criticisms or can't handle it.  Leave them alone and make better use of your time.  Share your stories, experiences, and opinions with those who do want to hear it.  They are here too.

Finally


**Conclusion**

In summary:

* Downvote bad content

* Upvote good content

* Submit good content

* Don't be an asshole

You can make this subreddit better today if you want to spend the effort.

If you have more ideas/suggestions feel free to post them here.

Brief: As a designer who knows how to use Photoshop, and there are already a large number of people who voluntarily help others. This gave me more encouragement. Then of course you sometimes see those photoshop trolls who create funny edits and give us a good laugh. So then a friend and I decided, why isn't there a dedicated site that offers this type of image editing engagement. Thus we created Zhopped. The goal of Zhopped is to be the first place to goto whenever someone needs an imaged edited. 

Right now, similarly to how /r/picrequests works but in a more approachable web interface. We found that many people are willing to help others. It's very humbling to see. If it's a simple 5 minute edit, why charge someone an arm and a leg for it. For the more demanding, professional photo editing, we do believe people should be compensated for. We are planning on creating a marketplace similarly to how freelancing sites work and NOT like some of the existing spec work sites.

1371532096.0,1gkg5z,A step-by-step guide to a great first business...a hot dog stand,SouthernSam,38,11,56,"Let me preface this...

I now own a tech company in SF
----------------------------------

I'm thought about making an online class. I haven't made it yet

Background: When I was in college I wanted to start my own company with that was fun

Most hot dog stands are run by redneck old dudes but I was an arrogant 20 year old college kid...so I (unfortunately) didn't take a lot of their advice because I wanted it to be young and hip.

So I thought about putting something together a step-by-step course. Here's what it would contain:

1. How to register a business...who to call
2. How to buy a cart
3. How to get certified by the health department
4. Step-by-step website set up
5. Registering for Square and taking credit card
6. Unique menu's that I used and tested
7. What starting supplies to buy and where to get them
8. How to find a spot 
9. Email and phone templates for cold calling places when asking to set up on their property
10. Templates for fairs
11. How to interact with customers
12. Little tips like adjusting prices for lunch vs. drunk night hours
13. Other ""dirty secrets"" like using cheap ketchup on drunk people
14. How to pay taxes
15. How to cook
16. Twitter
17. Marketing tips
18. How and when to buy merchandise 
18. How to be unique
19. Finally

About my business

Name: Southern Sam's
Was in business for 1 year. Some days made 50 bucks
Hired 3 people...including the ""Bikini Weenie Girls""
Slogan was ""Wieners as big as a baby's arm""
Ran it while in college.

Basically the app allows you to see others traveling to the same country/city you're going to during the same time(think of it almost like a match-making service)

You can see other users nearby (your actualy location isn't disclosed) and message/connect with them.

There is also a virtual passport feature where you collect stamps for every city you check in to.

Note: I'm extremely brief so please ask me anything i have not covered here

Site: [MyAppTemplates](http://myapptemplates.com/)

**Quick backstory**

So i've been making apps for over 2 years now and a few months back realized that i was spending a lot of money (and time) on the design and early stages of my app which did not allow me to focus a lot more of my resources on what really matters - marketing. 

Add to that the fact that design is probably my biggest weakness in entrepreneurship and you can see how this problem needed a solution

I saw that the wordpress market allowed for people with no design or development skills to make headway by providing them with usable 'themes' and wondered why there were no 'themes' for iphone apps. 

I looked around all over the web and found that no one was really providing this service in any kind of professional way

So far i have (with the help of others much better at design than me) created 7 unique and usable templates

Sales have been slowly rising month to month

Right now

I'm hoping to grow this quite dramatically over the next few months but am still trying to think of the best channel(s) to market this. Any advice would be appreciated.

As i mentioned above i tend to be very brief and so may not have included as much juicy details as i should have above - please ask anything you'd like to know in comments and i will answer. 

Here's that special offer for anyone who'd like to try the templates out!

Now, it only takes ONE person to cross that line and use that information to ruin your life.

**Update:** Thank you so much for those that gave great feedback. You all are awesome! I have updated the site - hopefully I did your feedback justice.

**My Story:**

I began working on this project in early 2009 to enhance the way people understand each other and work together on political issues. My hopes were to provide a platform for helping large groups to work on problems by expressing each of their own opinions

I've gone through so many iterations and redesigns of the application, and closer to my goal). So, while I am utterly biased, I really feel what I have designed is extremely innovative and (more importantly) desperately needed today. So I finally quit my excellent job to pursue it. Knowing that we didn't have enough funds to create the application and be anywhere close to self sustaining, we decided to market a crowdfunding campaign to get the funds we need.


**My Problem:**

 Turns out (*SURPRISE!*) marketing is even harder than I expected! Everything took so much longer than planned

* Demonstrate the potential benefits and implications
* Explain the research
* Capture people's imagination

Everything seems to be a balance

It was taught by two guys who are YC alums. I took a few notes and felt like typing them up and summarizing

- There are two main portions of the application

- All YC alums have access to review the written part of applications. When reviewing them, but they still review all applications themselves. Each partner has to review thousands of applications, so as you can imagine, they can only skim most of them.

WRITING PORTION

- #1 consideration is the team. YC uses your idea as a proxy to see if you are smart. If they like the team enough but not they idea they will fund you anyway

- Brevity/conciseness is key. Answers should not be more than 120 words. Keep in mind how little time each partner has to review. You need to make each word count. You also need to be sure to answer the question ""What are you building?"". Many people fail to do this. The litmus test should be this - ""If someone read the answer to this question

- Helps to ask others to review your application - they are a fresh pair of eyes. Make sure non-technical people can understand it easily.

- No buzzwords/jargon/b.s. Don't try to do a sales pitch

- Required video portion of interview: don't read a script. The goal of this is basically to see that you're a normal

INTERVIEW PORTION

- Interview only lasts 10 minutes. A timer starts when you walk in the room.

- Be prepared to answer many questions

- Try to convey the following: 1) What are you making, and 4) Why are you the right person to make it.

- Be knowledgable of competitors

- If you have a demo, that can help, and the YC partners will just stand over you and look at what you've got.

- Good way to prep is to ask people you know to poke holes in your idea

It doesn't make finding a technical cofounder easy. It doesn't make finding a market fit easy. It doesn't make coding easy. It doesn't make scale easy. It doesn't make sales easy. It doesn't make HR easy. It doesn't make accounting easy. It doesn't make your life easy. 

In fact

Before you get customers you only have yourself to think about. Once you have customers you have another master. Adding funding just adds *another* master to the mix

Do yourself a favor. Think of your company as a car, tires, suspension, etc etc. Well, raising money is like putting gasoline into your car.

What's that? You don't actually have a functioning engine? Whoops

Don't have a steering wheel? Ouch

Sounds silly, and just needs a tank of gas and a good wax. They want the sure thing, not the great idea.

At the moment, and 3d printers. That's largely because those are things I've wanted to buy recently. Currently I'm creating a dataset for UK politicians, so that I can create a shortlist of the best and worst.

1350876235.0,11vm6e,Would somebody please invent these?,surfingatwork,38,9,20,"Below is a list of things I wish people would invent. If you want to steal any of these ideas

**Toilet seats with pedals that lift the seat.**

How the hell has this not been mass produced yet? There was even an 11 year old American kid who invented one in like 2007 and made national news. But we still don't have them

It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to invent a toilet pedal

**A whole genre of music big enough to warrant its own radio station of techno music played solely by orchestras and designed to facilitate thinking**

This is another no-brainer that has been done before. Moby played with a full orchestra. Metallica played with a full orchestra. It was awesome. There's nothing wrong with listening to regular classical music played by orchestras. Young people just don't. If symphonies would get off their high horse in their ivory tower and stop telling their customers what they're supposed to consider refined music and give them what they want...a lot more musicians would have jobs.

If this kind of music were made under the supervision of professional psychologists

**Pop music with the words muffled**

I ain't gonna lie. If a Katy Perry song comes on the radio when I'm driving I'm likely to roll up my windows and turn up the volume until I come to a stop light or I'm about to let one of my friends in the car. That music is designed to be hypnotic, anti-intellectual brain rot makes me want to stab my ears with pencils. I'd buy damn near every pop album that came out if the words were sung in a different language that I couldn't understand or they were just electronically altered so the words sound like a raspy ghost (a sweet, sexy, raspy ghost). The only reason I listen to pop music on my headphones anyway is because I'm trying to drown out the sound of how much the city sucks. If everything pop singers say is just white noise anyway, then just give me the white noise without the insultingly stupid dialogue.

**Thick clothing with ambitious technological gadgets sewn into them**

 Technology has reached the point where this is possible. There's no reason we shouldn't all be walking around like Inspector Gadget with retractable propellers in our hats. I should be able to shoot Nerf bullets out of my coat sleeve. Women should be able to shoot mace out of theirs. Everybody loved Data's quircky, pockets, inflatable soles, lights and wheels into them. Run with that. If you can imagine cools ways to put gadgets onto super heroes, then just think of your customers as super heroes and pimp their clothes accordingly. When I shout, ""PANTS ACTIVATE!"" I want something to happen. I want two-way speakers in my collar and a HUD that flips down from the brim of my hat. I don't care what it does. I don't care if shows me Google Maps or my heart rate. I'll buy one pretty much no matter what. Our pocket books are as deep as your imagination. Someday someone is going to design a motor cycle jacket that, instead of having padding in the back has some kind of electronic gadget the size of a Manta Ray in it. If you're as big as a professional wrestler then you should be really upset. You could sew pounds of inconspicuous gadgets your jacket. I wonder who the first major clothing brand is going to make the Swiss Army Knife of leather jackets and become associated with extra-utilitarian clothing. By rights it should be the Swiss Army Knife company

**Sustainable Eco Office Neighborhoods**

The suburbs are unsustainable and inhumane. They're destroying the planet and making us miserable. It's like Jacque Fresco said, and I don't give a damn what he thinks people would/should behave like in a Utopian society. I just want his damn house. I wish he would spent the millions of dollars he's made off of advertising them on building them by now. And I don't know why everyone else hasn't stolen his ideas and made billions of dollars off them yet either.

I don't even need anything as fancy as The Venus Project. When I was a kid I lived three blocks from the actual projects. The outside of my house doesn't have to sparkle. All I need are sandbag walls, but if the number of drug addicts and Emo kids living in Suburbia is any indication of how frustrating and unfulfilling living in the suburbs is, I'd say it's a moral imperative to try something different. Point in fact, suburbia is unsustainable. It's not a matter of if it will collapse but when. Sooner or later we're going to be forced to try something different. So why not get rich doing the right thing that everybody is waiting to happen... right now? I'd do it myself, but I barely got enough money to build a sandwich.

**Floating island communities**

We have cruise ships, huge floating drum with a garden on the top and an anchor on the bottom. That'd be real easy to make. You could make one out of cement using a cast cheaper than it costs to build a 5 bedroom house. And yes, concrete floats.

Rich people like to live on boats. There'd be an instant market for luxury  floating drum islands. You could even make floating camp grounds and hotel chains to test the market first. And the best part about it is

Apparently they were on the verge of acquiring another company to do the same thing, means that there is time pressure as they will need to cut the other company loose.

Basically, but down to $2M if they can pay within a year (something they said was very unlikely given their current projections, which I've asked to see).

They want me to sign an LoI within a week that will give us 45 days to finalize the deal.

How typical is this deal structure?  Any gotchyas I should watch out for?  Should I try to negotiate on the numbers? (ie. try to go for more than $6M)

Not to be rude

*Update*: Ok, HN, and IRL, I've started to look at this deal differently.

It's basically a 50:50 rev share with an option to buy within 1 year for $1.5M *where whatever we've received from the rev share counts against the eventual acquisition price*.

I'm interested in hearing your opinions about sales and salespeople. Whether you actively employ them

I find most people in the startup space come in 2 regular flavors. There's the tech guy who couldn't sell let alone close if his life depended on it, but true in a generalized sense. How do you guys get your products actually sold? Are you relying on the product to sell itself? Have you hired a sales force before? What was your experience with it?

I ask because I'm interesting in furthering my career in the startup space. I find the potential to be staggering. I see a bunch of people developing these incredible products and services only to hit a brick wall. But I see sales as an everyday skill needed in the entrepreneurial headspace

So

I have done everything myself from designing the product and packaging to finding a manufacturer. I recently found an investor and we are about to go into full scale production. I would like to get some strangers' opinions and you guys seem like the perfect people to ask. 

The product is Flux Headphones. They are high quality in-ear heaphones for the iPhone, phone or anything else to prevent a tangles mess.  

My target market is high school kids. For some reason this age loves to wear things around their wrists like rubber bracelets and [those BS holographic things that ""improve balance"".](http://dsp.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pDSP1-12636381p275w.jpg) They also wear headphones during school and need somewhere to store them during class. We will start with this group but every age can benefit from these headphones. 

We believe that different situations require different headphones so we are also including a second pair in the box without the magnetic cable. This pair is lightweight and perfect for running or can just be stored as a back-up pair while the magnetic headphones are good for people on the go (work

This is what is included in the box: 

* 1 pair of headphones with the magnetic cable
* 1 pair of non-magnetic lightweight headphones
* 3 different sizes of removable silicon earbuds

We are initially producing them in black and white and hopefully expand to other colors in the future.

The magnetic version weighs around 18 grams which is less than [Beats by Dre Earbuds.](http://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/9492/9492426_ra.jpg;canvasHeight=500;canvasWidth=500) The magnets do not interfere with the sound quality and it poses no danger to the iPhone/iPod. 

Here is the black version:

Here is the box:

I still have time to make last minute changes before we start production so what do you guys think? Any suggestions about anything?

[EDIT] 


Thank you all for the feedback it has been very helpful. Some people like it

1. New name - something catchy with the word magnet or mag somehow incorporated 
2. New logo and package design - Hiring a design firm
3. Black version will be all back
4. No longer including the second pair of headphones
5. Rethink pricing strategy

We've treated this project as a startup the entire time and have learned a lot along the way. The hardest lessons we're learning are around marketing.

Someone pitched a totally awesome idea that had immediate possibility to be a real revenue generating startup and I wanted in.  So I approached and said I would provide my professional services in exchange for foundership/equity.  

I invested myself heavily into making the pitcher’s idea real

We didn’t place high enough to get any accolades due to how quickly I wrote this thing ( some edge cases screwed the pooch) but it was still a viable idea and I really was excited to go back and clean up my habber dash code and make it into a production revenue generating product.

Alas, leaving a place open for them if they changed their mind later to which they said they would mind and wouldn’t be happy if I stole their idea.

By my estimates

* Litigate for control ( No Zuckerberg lose ends for me )

* Demand compensation

* Slap the AGPLv3 kiss of death on my stillborn code and then publish the mess somewhere quietly

Having a Judge and a Attorney as family members plus a past life doing legal undergraduate classes

PS. English is probably a fifth or sixth language for me


Edit:

I very much appreciate the good/bad/brutal feedback.  So far to sum up somethings that stood out:

* Just because a partner backs out

* Yeah it sucks; move on and stop feeling sorry for myself ( no one has said it that brutally but I get the feeling its there between the lines ).

* swombat pointed to an excellent post about not making any assumptions and really talking things out with your partner.  [swombat's linked article](http://danieltenner.com/posts/0005-starting-up-with-a-friend.html).  In reflection this is totally what happened.  I joined the startup weekend with blinders on, thinking about his comments, was only there to compete in a game, to socialize, and have a good time.  We never had an opportunity to reconcile this until afterwards.  In reflection I think they probably regret pitching their idea and fear losing control of their baby.

* Even talking about Litigation is completely f'ing stupid

Last year I was working freelance, we deployed, everything went very smoothly.

My client at the time mentioned that he wanted to give me a 10% equity stake in the business. I'd heard that line before

Since then, I've also been working on the web app -- I know, terrible idea as a freelancer to work for free, but money hasn't really been a concern for me, and it was a pretty interesting project to keep as a side-project. I probably spent at least 2-3 times as long over the past year working on the site as I did building it in the first place. I don't regret any of this, it's totally fine. I haven't billed for any of this work.

Now

He's offering me 10%. I think I should be getting at least 30% (I haven't yet replied to his offer). I know I'm not entitled to anything, and I'm free to walk away entirely if we don't come to terms. I don't feel I'm owed anything, but I would like more of a stake if I'm going to be investing this much time on top of my day job.

I'd be working as a sole technical cofounder -- basically doing all of the work around building

Hey people

The long version:
A few years ago I made a cool photo browsing UI based on the flickr API.  A guy I met at the NYTech Meetup introduced me to some people

Eventually they actually started looking for money on the project.  During this time we expanded the product to accept images from any api, and another programmer who they had introduced me to would form a company at a 25% split four ways (dumb move #1, I believe).

We eventually found some money and I moved to marin to work on the thing for a few months (turned out to be about 8 months).  Without going into a lot of detail, and I was an at will employee ( dumb move #3 - ""how can they fire me?  I made the thing!"" ).  I none the less did the vast majority of dev work and enjoyed my (by my art school standards) giant paycheck.  I was allowed no investor contact, though finagled some anyway.

Months later, which also had a cool photo viewing UI (pornopticon.com - ""be the porn you want to see in the world!"" , if you're interested).  I was immediately fired for ""stealing code"" and going into business against the company.  Whether or not this is legitimate (I say ""not at fucking all""), California allows for no fault dismissals, and I was told to hit the road.  My unvested shares were bought out eventually and I hold about 1.5% of the company.

They recently closed their ""seed round"" and are doing an A round now.

Recently I got in touch with the CEO and asked if I could be at least regarded in company material as the creator of the product.  He explained to me that he had actually come up with the ideas in the product and that I was simply doing his coding work for him.  This caused me...fury.  Indeed this is why I'm finally saying fuck it

- Pornopticon.com was deved on my own machine on my own time
- The products *do* have some similarities
- I did not file the patent on my own
- For a while I was told that I would be sued if I did anything with ""movable
- There was a two month period (after the first investment) where I worked for free, and that I worked for free because the project was behind.
- My lawyer-second-cousin suggested suing them for intentionally planning  for the company
- He also suggested finding a lawyer who would do some contingency work
- I have though of going on a publicity campaign of some sort
- My lovely ex GF suggests that these people are a bunch of assholes
- I am always torn because they have far better investor contacts, I want them.

",10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/usd64/i_didnt_know_this_but_there_are_some_really/,"I was told by a redditor that my page sucked and to look into wordpress. I had before but found that the wordpress themes that are stardard are really terrible.

So I did a bit of searching after being encouraged to buy some or something.

I found a theme builder online. You can Google ""WordPress theme generator"" and find some pretty decent ones. Then I found some good ones on theme forrest because of  blog I found. I tend to search for things like ""best WordPress themes"" at which point google adds the current year and I end up getting really good information.

So even though I just gave out some very helpful information I have more. Oh dear God do I have more.

So I was told about a theme builder called visual composer. It looks pretty awesome. It allows you to do a lot of neat things within a theme. It doesn't build the theme but it allows you to modify the contents of it with a lot of really neat widgets like sliders, etc.

Then on the blog I had found I found a theme called ""karma"" and boy is it wonderful. It's cheap too. for 40 bucks you get an insane amount of stuff with it. Looks very very professional. For 40 bucks there is no way I could get anyone to build anything close to looking that good. It is on theme forrest as well.

Also, icons, etc. Just wonderful.

Just wanted to share these things. Let's talk about resources below. Help each other out on the websites thing.

The CEO was impressed even though the solution seemed rather obvious. I finish the job and I start helping them out with other things. I rewrite their terrible English and Spanish copy

So a week before leaving, so I tell him that I understand given that the website is about to launch and that I was willing to accept a short ""internship"", maybe some stock options and a basic stipend to pay for my expenses. He agrees and says he'll draw up a contract.

So I start work

I get back and keep the same pace. I'm work every day until 10-11pm. I review operations completely and keep developing the partner network. Mid-March

End of March, and that salaries would not be paid. People quit, leaving just the CEO, his assistant and me. At this point, I am managing most the operational aspects of the firm while they look for funding. I never get a contract, not even an NDA.

Potential investors come and go, the CEO cedes 1% of the company to me, but still no salaries. He starts complaining of having no money. Morale continues dropping.

End of June arrives and there's still no funding, I continue working.

To cut costs

Then last Wednesday, explaining I'm still working nearly 12 hours a day. I show them the results. I go for a walk to calm down and when I get back he's left a message on my phone repeating his accusation and a couple of emails threatening to quit. The emails continue into the next day.

I send out an email the next day stating I can't work in these conditions and that I am stopping my current collaboration immediately. I offer to continue working if they can propose a reasonable a mandate with a minimal budget and well-defined scope.

That was last week. So far nothing but silence. I have no clue what's going on and I don't really care anymore. A real shame. I think it is the first startup I've worked for that is not gonna make it. I just wish I had been hired a year ago

So

I am a 24 yr old dreamer from a large, I have been drawing/creating/dreaming up things. I have quite a niche for seeing things other people can't see, and bringing out the treasure in what would otherwise be seen as trash. (I'm horrible at articulating what I'm trying to say though, as you can probably tell...) While I excelled in my job at the call center, being promoted to a Supervisor position within the first 6 months, I was also absolutely miserable with my life and the lack of creation involved in the work. I eventually developed extreme anxiety issues, and came to realize that life wasn't worth living if you were doing something you hate doing. But, I decided to try to make money off of my creative abilities.

(I'm not sure if this is the best place to start a new paragraph, fixing it up for my siblings as gifts, and using the photos as a portfolio for my possible business. After posting a few things I'd done for free, I slowly got messages from people who wanted me to do things for them, and was able to make a little money. When I say little, I mean people in this town basically wanted me to work for free. I'm never sure how much to charge for things, rather then the basic ""supplies"", I painted a firetruck dresser for a lady for $50, but I realized at the end of the week that after buying what I needed I was down $30

Flash forward to today, with my new boyfriend in a small apartment. I've been up here for 7 months now, and have decided to give it one more shot at getting started in some sort of business before I go back to a dreaded life of call center hell. I've created a Facebook page, shared as much as possible, advertised on craigslist, and printed up flyers and advertised at all the local community bulletins. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any responses. I think mainly it's because I'm not sure what to advertise, but I'd love to hear some suggestions. Please, I want to make this work.

What's in it for you: free market research that I think you'll find insanely valuable.

What's in it for me:  building my portfolio.  I will ""own"" the market research

I'm probably only going to do 1 or 2 of the better ideas that are posted.  Interested?  Answer the following questions:

1 - Describe what you do
2 - Describe who you think your competition is (if you know that)
3 - Describe what your differentiator is
4 - Do you have a target market thought out?  If you do what is it?
5 - Do you have anything built now or a website?


After I do the research I'll link you to the results that I come up with and ask you questions about the value you found in the results.  I will post the results I do to reddit.

The Blurb:
MixeeLabs a platform for 3d printing web apps. We enable designers and developers to make 3d printing web apps using Javascript. These apps are interactive, and plug into Shapeways for production. 

We wanted to do a modeler's platform

Some background: 
3d printing is a hot thing in tech right now. And a big problem a lot of people are tackling is how to get people to generate content for 3d printing. Modeling in CAD is a pain. My approach is through making web apps

(Disclaimer: I'm in my last year of law school and myself and two classmates started a company that specializes in informing MMA startups about the costs and procedures for FDA regulation. This isn't a pitch for my company just some advice for MMA startups. I'm also using a throwaway because I don't want my company attached to my reddit account.)

Sorry for the essay but I think this is very important for any MMA startup.

I just want to impart some advice for anybody either starting a mobile medical application or looking to start one soon. I have a feeling there might be some of you on this sub because this market is **exploding**. Last year Kalorama Information [published a report](http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2012/6/13/report-mobile-medical-app-market-expected-to-grow-by-25-annually.aspx) predicting a yearly growth rate of 23%. VC's are [clamoring to pick up MMA companies](http://www.mobileworldlive.com/vc-funding-in-health-it-shoots-up) with a 2013 Q1 total of $493 million raised versus $236 million in Q1 2012. With that said there is one **massive** barrier to entry into this market: the FDA.

The capital barrier is relatively small for the MMA market. As such, middle, and end stages of your company will be determined by FDA standards.

From my talks with VC's, every single one that received funding either was in the process of getting FDA approval or mentioned what their FDA plans were.

There are some alternatives if you are a company that is strapped for cash and can't afford to hire a big law firm to help you with your regulatory strategy. First, the FDA 513 process can help but don't rely solely on it. Be weary that the rules for what an MMA is and is not are not defined yet, but knowing the process, especially the 510(k) and NSE standards, and the costs and risks associated with that will help you build those into your business plan. You just have to make sure to do your due diligence and make sure you are making the correct projections.

The worst case scenario is that you don't get FDA approved because you did not follow the process

I want to see the market succeed. I think that MMAs have a lot of potential to help a lot of people and right now is just the beginning of the market growth. I do not want to see the FDA stifle innovation and force companies out of the market

For more information you can check out an article I wrote on how startups should plan for FDA. You can read it [here](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/10/24/a-coming-storm-fda-regulation-of-mobile-medical-applications/#more-53682)

**TL;DR: So if you take one thing away from this it should be that planning for FDA regulation is probably the most important issue to handle as soon as you can as it determines everything from business and marketing strategies,,False,,t5_2qh26,False,,True

I contacted BosiDNA and requested my opt-in records (IP/timestamp) and in their reply they indicated they obtained my address from cofounderslab.  Now this is quite bothersome because on the cofounderslab sign-up page it explicitly states the following:

**""We promise not to share your email with anyone else.""**

The scam seems to work like this.  At some point a few weeks ago I received a private message/e-mail on cofounders lab with the subject ""You received a request from ___ on CoFoundersLab""

And inside the email it stated ""___ wants to know what type of entrepreneur you are! They've requested that you take the entrepreneurial archetype assessment. It's only 10 questions and it's free! Here's what to do:

1355524795.0,14v732,I am budgeting for my APP company start up and I am having difficulty understanding the Ad revenue system.  Can anyone explain this to me simply?,byerover,24,3,31,"I have been going in circles with my research trying to figure this out and I would greatly appreciate any help!!!

I have an APP concept that I plan to monetize through in APP advertisements mostly.  I am aware of the other methods/combinations for monetizing

From what I understand

So to calculate revenue I would do so based on the amount of impressions per month and the CPM value.  I may have this wrong


To calculate the amount of impressions/month: I planned on doing this based on estimating how many users out of the total who have my APP use the app each day and how many impressions and click throughs they provide. 
 [Off the top of my head Ex: An estimated 45% of the total users will use the app once per day, and 10% will use it once a week and the remaining 20% users will use it 1-2 a month.  On Average each user will provide 2 impressions each time they use the APP.  So if I have 100,000 users and that remains constant, I can expect 100,000(.45(30)+.05(60)+.2(3*4.34)+.1(4.34)+.2(1.5))=1,983,800 Impressions per month.]  

Where I am having trouble is finding out how to calculate the CPM value.  Is it something like X impressions a month times $1/(Y amount of impressions)?  What about for click throughs?

If I knew how to do this

I don't know if I am off on all of this or not

EDIT:  Thanks everyone for the input.  It seems that the general consensus is that CPM's are low, as well as provide some sort of disclaimer with investors about the unpredictability of not only AD Revenue, but the APP market in general.  

Another questions though.  Using instagram as an example.  Instagram had no revenue, so acquiring their 33 million users and combining the services would increase Facebooks exposure by 33 million, while their normal Facebook users were, at the time, valued at $100/user.  So to them, they were getting new users at a fraction of their value.  Plus, Instagram hadn't been marketing very aggressively at that point, Instagram had been funded by angel investors reaching into the millions, or subscription revenue

A) How were they valued at $30 per user?  
B) Why were investors still pumping money in and evaluating the company in the millions?  

Is it because of potential value for the future since they had such aggressive growth early on?  I have my theories but would like to hear others on that.  ",,t5_2qh26,1355848501.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/14v732/i_am_budgeting_for_my_app_company_start_up_and_i/

I currently emphasize this ""process"" angle -but I feel that site visitors will not sign up if they just want to manage projects.
Does anyone have advice on how I could address both aspects of the app? The current app summary is: process tracking simplified - but it really is project management and process tracking simplified - which seems a bit too much to write...

* PHP - as it is now
* node.js (JavaScript)
* Ruby
* Python
* Java
     

My own bias is, I can't see a need to move away from PHP. Also, adding a new technology without any clear advantage, seems to increase the teams required skills with no benefit, which seems a poor decision.

I attempted a startup 6 years ago and failed. I blamed a lot on various conditions, it was a damn good idea and it actually predicted where the market would be now. So to put it lightly, I feel pretty proud of myself that we could have seen this coming in this specific area of the market years before it happened. 

Why didn't it work out? I had subcontracted the programming/web development to a competent commission based programming team. In other words

I never found another partner

Roughly 2 years ago I had a moment of insight for a service that I know will be huge in the realm of integrated and normalized data communication. Over the two years I have talked to 50 or 60 programmers, but no one seriously committed to the project, though nearly everyone was convinced that the business model spectacular and the potential was monumental. Every time it seemed I had someone who wanted to work with me, something came up and they wavered. The whole thing is based off of momentum, stages of development. 2 weeks ago a service launched that was nearly identical and verbatim of the first leg of the business model. 

This pretty much stopped me in my tracks

Regardless of the size and scope of the idea

I need to find that person

For a while I've liked the concept of the 'revenue' figure within products like Google Analytics and KISSMetrics.  Unfortunately I have found that it's of little use other than as a broad metric of how things are progressing and hardly gives me a true feel of how good my profit / cash position really is.

I wanted to ask if other founders feel the same and how you tackle the problem?  I have also looked at InDinero

Perhaps there needs to be a service that targets the 'accounting' needs of a SaaS business...i.e. nothing more than easily recording revenue from their product

We're still developing so technically they were bidding on the idea and not on any current revenue we're bringing in.

The structure was as follows:

35% investors

35% me and my co-founder (vested)

10% reserved for a CTO

20% for raising future capital (dilutable shares)

And to get all of the funding we had to meet certain sales goals on a monthly basis. We didn't really see the value in adding a CTO so early since we're outsourcing the development to 3 really good coders abroad at the moment and it's so much more cost efficient at this stage of the game. We're technical enough to handle the management of the devs on our own I think.

At the end of the day I think we can negotiate better equity if we self-funded and released first. As it is we would be taking a loss by accepting such a low offer merely because we're unproven (their words).

Any insight on the situation? Thanks guys!

And then immediately after that I got a major day job upgrade and have been insanely busy and totally neglectful of the site ever since. 

It gets about 600 visits/day, and the occasional (surprisingly friendly) takedown request from a gonewilder having second thoughts. There are currently 3,261 users storing 610,830 unique images (99GB worth) with 808,972 tags (5,654 unique). I have done zero promotion aside from the original HN and Reddit posts, and haven't been able to respond to the feature requests with anything but ""sorry

I'd like to hand it off to someone who will actually grow and improve it. That someone is definitely not me. I'm happily employed at one awesome startup, if I'm honest with myself, the interest in this particular project. I started it mostly out of curiosity -- I wasn't sure the bookmarklet could work. But the users who are already there really seem to like it, and I don't want to shut it down on them just because I got bored. And if a single incompetent reddit post got it this far I have to think someone who actually knows how to market it could get a lot more attention. 

(It would also be pretty great if I could earn a modest return on the dev time I originally sunk into it. But I'm under no illusions that it's worth a fortune. I'm more concerned with giving it a good home.)

The problem is I have **no idea** where to find a buyer. ""Legitimate"" web site markets like Flippa have strict policies against adult material. Adult-specific markets like GFY are full of people looking to buy cookie cutter content sites. They wouldn't have a clue what to do with an image aggregator ""app"". I'm afraid I've painted myself into two corners: I've got something that's too popular to just abandon but not popular enough to quit my day job over

I have some tips from watching her work. This is the 5th startup I've been ""part of"" though I try to keep my advice out of our marriage! Some things that have worked for her:

* A brand. It started with a logo

* Good use of the website and Facebook to show off her creations.

* Adaptable. She found that tutus sell like crazy right now. She figures that tutus are a fad and so she has done a good job mixing the tutus with her other creations to great success.

* Amazing personal networking. I've always done a good job at personal networking and she puts me to shame. She has friends and friends of friends selling for her! She also has vendors and even competitors bringing work in for her! She is social and outgoing by default and having a brand that matches her personality helps.

* Constantly striving to improve quality. Even though her products are hand assembled and the brand is N4OCD - Not for OCD - she still puts a lot of effort into improving her products.

* Figures out what she needs and finds a way to get it. This is one area that I have helped with. She needed a better machine to handle the quantity of work coming in. And then 3 months later she needed an even better machine! As you can imagine this hit us in the pocket book pretty hard but we figured out how to make it work which has led to a better business model for her. There's less waste due to machine overheating/fatigue. I suggested she keep the ""old"" machine as a backup (she was planning to sell it to offset some of the cost of the new one) and she's now using it in parallel with the new machine when things are really busy.

* Shops like crazy to keep overhead low. She is always looking for deals on material and other supplies and even the new giant production machine was purchased at half price saving thousands of dollars (she also used her personal network to help her land that deal). She also watches for events and clips coupons.

* Simple systems. She uses an Excel spreadsheet to track her orders.

* Follows up. She asks how gifts were received and asks for pictures of people wearing her products. Some of these shots end up on Facebook (with permission) but she loves getting these pictures and it seems to be fun for the customers to show off a bit. She also sends emails/texts/Facebook posts to past clients to check in with them which has led to return customers.

* She tells stories with her creations. Her products are not about the materials they are made from but rather the story that they represent. If you have a daughter and want her to be princess for a day

* She works hard. We have a young daughter that requires attention during the day so my wife uses that time to send emails and update posts. She does production in the evening and she is often up after midnight to make sure she hits her promised timelines.

* Her prices are low. When I pointed out that child workers in China make more per hour than she does

Those are things I can think of off the top of my head and I think most of those will apply to any startup.

Two friends and I have been developing a navigation app designed for walking.  It looks like a compass, showing you the distance and direction.  It's great for areas like college campuses, music festivals, and theme parks, where traditional navigation apps don't work. You can also save destinations into lists, called Maps, which you can then share with others in our database. You can also download maps made by other users to make things even easier!

We just released the app on the app store and wanted you to be some of the first people to try it out and give us feedback.

[Check it out on the app store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/falcon/id506151543?mt=8) and let us know what you think! We especially appreciate any feedback you have on improving existing features or adding new ones.

My main issue is a clause stating that the company has the right to retain all but 2% of shares accepted by the employee if termination of employment is decided by employer. Is a stipulation like this normal and couldn't the company terminate me after I work to reduce my compensation?

Half of the shares will be vested 18 months after the completion of the project

These terms are negotiable. My plan was to try to get rid of the retention of shares entirely and have a graduated vesting schedule that gives me shares through steps of the project

TL;DR: Startup has clause to retain shares if it decides to terminate me; how should I negotiate.

My friend recently resigned from his position as a developer at a technology startup. The reasons are plenty and that's a horror story in itself. My friend signed non disclosure and non compete agreements when he started the job about 1 year ago. He gave the employer his social insurance number and was paid by check. From what I understand he was paid under the table - taxes weren't filled I believe.

The situation got very toxic when he gave the employer his 1-month
notice. The employer is telling my friend he'll make sure he can't work in software for 1 year and something about making him ""pay back"" the money he earned. My friend wants to review the contracts but the employer is apparently withholding them.

**This is the first public showing of my MVP, so it has been tough getting this to the point I am happy enough to show it off. Not being able to quit my day job, or work on it 24/7, this has happened in fits and starts mostly in the evenings or all nighters over the weekends.

As an avid web developer / geek / gamer / tech lover I find myself constantly finding projects or products I am interested in and want to follow. Some have social profiles, especially with the likes of kickstarter, indie developers, fast moving technology, and the current trend of innovation announcing awesome new things at a lightning pace.

Eventually these things get forgotten or fall into a mass of other saved links and rarely if ever get found again. I therefore tasked myself with creating a web service that would track those projects and then remind myself / the user about them at the appropriate times.

**Thus

**Current features**

* Browsing existing projects

* Adding projects (with a title, and link)

* Updating projects (links

* Comments

* Badgering (when you 'badger' or follow a project it will then send you reminders when the project or product has various milestones, rumours etc)

* Adding additional links and dates

* Lots of planned upcoming features*

**Initially I am looking for some feedback from the community**

* what you think of the concept of the site / service

* what you like best

* what you like least

* what you think its missing

* if its a service you would / could use

This will help me determine what I need to work on next in order to make it a more usable, as it is on discovery. Unfortunatley you can't just google 'cool stuff' and it returns relevant, interesting projects and products, I am hoping Hype Badger will be the place for this to happen.

Hubski is a social aggregator without shared pages. On Hubski, and posts that they share. Likewise, people that follow you see your posts, and posts that you share. There is no voting on posts. There is no longer a karma system.

As a result of this design, you simply unfollow the person that is sharing them with you. One bonus from this design is it makes moderation very hands-off.

There are a few other nifty things that we have done since. IMO, and users slowly earn badges that they can attach to their [favorite posts or comments](http://hubski.com/badgesubs).

Also just yesterday we changed the way that users find new content. Now instead of a shared ‘all posts’ page

Anyhow

I am quite happy with the direction we have, and fresh eyes are invaluable.

I'm in the process of getting off the ground with a startup that requires a SSL certification. i.e. not a shared SSL but a dedicated/custom one.

I was thinking of getting [this certificate](http://www.digicert.com/welcome/ssl-plus.htm) from DigiCert. 

I currently took out CDN subscription with CDN77.com - since this is my first startup, while they seem to have a base in the UK, US etc, I seem to be dealing with people primarily in the Czech Republic (regardless of the hours I email/call etc.). [This is merely an observation, and not intended to be racist in any way.]

Anyway

I then contacted CDN77 and asked them if they could install third party SSL certificates for me. I paste the response that I got from them below.

&gt;Hello

&gt;We can not use your own cert
&gt;We are using one cert for all CDN SSL resources.

&gt;This solution is fully valid and it is needed to have it this way

&gt;So this is the reason

&gt;Thank you for your understanding.

1. Is the above email... well BS? Is this merely a question of a company not being able/not wanting to implement 3rd party SSL certificates or is it a genuine issue?
2. Just with anything else
3.  If 1. *is* a genuine issue
4. What companies offer decent SSL certification for non-US companies? i.e. that the paperwork doesn't take forever?
5. Is there really a difference from a security/crypto standpoint [within different dedicated SSL certs?](http://www.digicert.com/welcome/product-overview.htm#ev) or is it primarily just marketing hype?

I run a small web-based software development shop (five people) located almost next door to the University of Michigan.  Over the past couple of years we've begun to transition more towards consulting rather than actually writing code for other people. Much of this is consulting on cloud-based application architecture and deployment, design (or refactor) their code to be more scalable/durable in the cloud, reduce their AWS costs, etc.  We also provide managed DevOps services where we function as the client's primary point-of-contact for Amazon, provide support to the developers and their tools, get them setup using continuous integration and browser-based regression testing, coordinate deployment amongst the different environments, etc.

In short

Our ideal client is a tech start-up who's recently gotten their Series A funding and needs to quickly ""grow up"" (fixing architecture issues with the initial app version, but honestly, there just aren't that many opportunities here.

What's weird is that these conversations are completely low-key, especially when advising young entrepreneurs such as myself?
