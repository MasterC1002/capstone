I am a bartender at a VFW, I specifically asked my boss if there was a uniform/dress code. He said no, but they would get me a couple of button-up shirts(BBP by itself) just in case I wanted to wear them. 

Fast forward a few months. Still no shirts given to me, with his wife. Lo and behold, the next day I was informed I would have to start wearing the uniform that I never received. The members voted on this and everything. A meeting about my boobs.

It is now a few months past this event, I wear a jacket or sweater just to avoid the comments.

Part of me wants to look at whoever says something about the uniform, I would like to keep my job. I am trying to think of some passive-aggressive modifications to make to my uniform. Here are a few thoughts:
1. Altering the shirt to be extremely figure flattering and missing the top three buttons or so.
2. Extremely bright colors/tie-dyed. 
3. Clever pun/symbol on the back

I ended up buying a couple 34Es at Bloomingdale's that were on sale and were super comfortable. I've been in the right size bra for like two weeks and I have almost no back pain. But now my mom doesn't believe that I'm actually that size

Note: I'm 5'2"" and I weigh 118 pounds.

I even showed her the difference between the way the 36Cs were fitting and the way a 34E fits - I have none of that underarm ""fat"" that's really just breast tissue with nowhere to go, and the gore lies flat. 

She still insists that I'm in the wrong size and that going up a band size will be a better fit. So I'm frustrated.

First, but there was nothing really I could do about it. It’s not like I could just walk up to random women and tell them that they are probably wearing the wrong bra size.

A few months after I had stumbled on bigboobproblems, and has fantastic boobs. On our first date I noticed that she had some quad-boob problems visible slightly through her tank top, and I restrained myself from making a comment or suggestion. For a few months I would occasionally browse bigboobproblems trying to find a story about a boyfriend or husband who brought up getting correctly fitted to their SO, but nothing ever really helped my situation. I knew she wasn’t wearing the right size, but how would I bring it up?

Eventually, it finally felt like the right time to bring it up. I was scared that she would think it was weird that I knew so much about bras and bra sizing, but I felt I had to say something.  So, one day as we were texting back and forth about her getting lingerie for Valentines Day, I asked her what her bra size was so I could look for lingerie as well. I knew that she was probably wearing a 38DD or something close to that, so when she told me that she wore a 36DD I wasn’t that surprised. She said that most stores don’t even carry her size, let alone in any cute styles. She also mentioned that she was pretty sure she was wearing the wrong bra size as well

I told her that I knew a fair amount about bra sizing

She was not weirded out at all, the less attractive it was. Shopping online for a bra did not appeal to her either. She was also appreciative of the fact that I know what the struggles are of having larger breasts. The next time we were together I showed her this subreddit and shared links with her on how to be fitted properly. A week or so later we got a measuring tape and I helped measure her using the guide in the side bar. It was a really fun experience and was very sexy. It helps that she has a positive image about her breasts. She ended up being a 34G, which was actually what I had guessed, funny enough.

We went to Nordstrom later that day to look at bras. The selection as far as colors and patterns wasn’t the greatest, and had my girlfriend try on a lot of different bras. She ended up purchasing two bras that day, a black Freya Deco AA4234 plunge bra and a red Freya Honey Deco plunge bra. They both fit well and her posture has improved. Her boobs also look great, now that they are actually being supported. She was also excited to learn that there are bikinis and sports bras that will actually fit her boobs.

I really wanted to share my and my girlfriend’s story, her boobs look better than ever, which is definitely a plus.

I also hear the good old ""if barbie was real"" she would have a waist of 18"" and a bust of 36""

On [FullerFigureFullerBust's post on celeb bra sizes](http://fullerfigurefullerbust.com/2012/12/11/celebrity-bra-sizes/) we also saw a lot of comments like ""they would be falling on their faces from the weight of their chests in proportion to the rest of their bodies"" when she suggested sizes like 24K/28F-GG/30FF-J.

And I really have to think... What? Besides having completely exaggerated ideas of what those sizes look like

The Barbie one, which is still fairly mainstream.. Assuming a 4-6"" waist reduction, and a slightly larger underbust, ""barbie"" could be a 24HH-26GG, which is not at all an ""impossible"" size. 

I can't imagine why someone would think certain sizes would be impossible to even 'carry' - even if we aren't talking about boobs, of course we can carry out breasts!! Sure, especially without a good bra, it can be a strain, but not something that will make us crawl on all 4's or literally break unless we also suffer from some pretty severe physical problems....

But why have I always thought they were ""too big""? I think I know why. I think it's because I was given the message that A, but still okay to have. But DD was borderline acceptable. But DDD and up and you required a special, hard to find, 70 hook, ugly bra because your breasts were too big to be accommodated for in a normal person lingerie department. 

And forget about cute. Big boobs meant unattractive boobs that were not to be celebrated by lacey or colorful bras. And no cleavage enhancing bras either... big boobs are not sexy boobs.

So my inability to find a bra gave me the idea that my boobs were too big...not normal...something i should feel embarrassed about. Now I have great bras

But the bra shops have been lying to me! My boobs aren't too big! They look great on my body. My figure isn't a delinquent. I'm so glad that I learned today that my boobs are good boobs...not problem boobs.

I share my story because I imagine that many of you have gone through, so I'm not medically recommending these exercises to everyone. I'm just sharing what worked for me.  (I should also mention that I have only been wearing the right size bra for a year or two. Thanks /r/bigboobproblems for help with this!)

So, my PT has given me exercises to strengthen my glutes and my core. Also, there are lots of great exercises for pelvic tilt on YouTube. 

[This is a pretty good picture](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xLCRYa2pYFA/TDVT7OW4F5I/AAAAAAAADu4/nf9jDP2JSoQ/s1600/pelvic_tilt.jpg) of the position for the first, make sure you feel your lowest abdominal muscles contracting . Hold this position for 10 seconds, and do 10 reps. It seems simple, and like you're barely doing anything, but if you do it right, your abs will probably be sore. 

The next one is done almost the same way, and switching feet. It's like marching really lightly. Alternate legs until you've lifted each leg 5 times, and do 5 reps. 

After I got used the two exercises above

After those two

The last one is similar to an exercise called [Superman](http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/exercises.asp?exercise=191).  Instead of lifting both arms and legs at the same time, and lifting my left arm and right leg. Make sure to squeeze your glutes with doing this one!  This one strengthens the lower back muscles. 

Another thing that has been helping me is stretching my shoulders.  My mom has bothered me for years to put my shoulders back

If you have pain from bad posture, I just look skinnier without the pelvic tilt.

Being on Reddit has been an interesting experience. On the upside, they never seem to be able to confess their love without putting woman with big boobs down. Woman and Men do it. Always I'm seeing about how our boobs can even be seen as ""disgusting"" ""saggy"" ""ugly"". I even recall someone saying he would never marry a lady with large boobs because a woman with small ones would be better in the long run (or something like that, it was posted awhile back) I think he even went as far to say that we couldn't be trusted. Even if a troll, those words hurt. Those words make me feel ashamed for having these soft, large, carry along pillows. All of this hate, is driving me nuts. I thought when I got older it would change

After the advice of many women on reddit

When we arrived, but secretly I had gotten my hopes so high. I thought I could walk right in and be surrounded by bra cups that looked familiar in huge-ness to the ones I had at home. But it was just...normal. 

Of course, which on /r/abrathatfits had been around a K cup). She offered to fit us, which was great since I knew that with such big measurements my calculated size probably wasn't accurate. 

We get into the dressing room, and it's a 38F. Yeah, no. Not even close. We ask her to go up in cup size. 

While she's gone for another (very strangely long) time, but I guess we could try on a lot of bras, right? Well, sort of. She kept bringing *handfuls* of the next size up, without actually fitting us correctly. She would say, oh, 36F doesn't fit you? Let me bring about 10 different 36FF bras! Try on one style, take away all of them

Finally my mom found some bras that she was comfortable in. I didn't love the fit but there was no folding, so that was good. 

But now that the focus was on me, that looked like they could belong to my grandmother. And none of them fit. At one point she brought some molded cup bras, which I loved, but they were all way too small, maybe a FF cup at best, so before I could try any on, she whisked them away as well. 

I kept trying to go up in cup size, my boobs were either bulging out a bit, or folding back near my armpits. And ALL of the bras I tried were lift and separate, and made my boobs look like pointy mountains, pointing me towards opposite ends of the room. I remarked to my mom that I could fit a 2 liter soda bottle between them. 

I was getting frustrated, but please, no more grandma bras. 

So, and they were still crappy, just the underwire kept getting wider, rather than the cups getting bigger, and the cups weren't holding all of my boobs and it was a disaster. The woman finally admitted that they didn't go past a JJ cup, and the one I had tried on didn't seem to fit. I mean, she wasn't trying any different styles, please

So finally I put on my old bra (which sadly felt better compared to the ones I have been trying on. And, you most certainly do *not* want to feel relief when this ripped up, stained, unsupportive bra is better than any of these new ones you've been shoving your boobs into). I walked onto the floor to look for myself. Honestly, they didn't have any styles I liked unless they were a C cup at most. Anything bigger than that was almost no padding, and a lot lift-and-separate action. There were even a few Cleo by Panache bras! I got really excited, only to find they go up to a G cup in this store, I went to the Cleo website and looked up where I could buy them in store. This was the only place near me. And

So I went back into the dressing room with my mother. I tried on one cleo in G for good measure, in front of my mother, in that horrible dressing room. I know it's silly and probably paints me as immature but I couldn't handle it. I got my hopes too far up. I didn't realize it beforehand, but I had secretly been thinking that Nordstom would finally be the end-all-be-all of big boobed bra shopping. I had thought I would walk in and leave with armfulls of wonderful bras. I didn't expect it to be even more frustrating than when a store simply doesn't carry my size.

My mother left and found me several bras. I found one that really fit. **One.** It was a 36HH. And we bought it, not painful, but a little too snug really, and it came up very high, to the top of my breast tissue. And it's some serious lift and separate action, and I didn't like how I looked in profile. My boobs were gone, shoved out to she sides

We found two other bras. One exactly like one I have at home that I don't love, but they stopped just below an H cup. So I got a GG cup and just kind of shoved my boobs in there and said that I'd lose the weight to fit into it. I wanted to cry when we checked out. Looking at these bras I was having my parents pay so much money for, that I didn't even love. I was settling because all of my other bras are broken, have underwire that has ripped through and jabs me, or have straps and bands that are stretched to twice their original size. Right now I'm wearing a 38G old bra. I know I'm at least a 36HH. It sucks.

I don't think my mother understood how upsetting it was for me, all the while I was trying not to cry. She offered to get food at the food court but I wasn't hungry. The drive home she was normal as usual, and only after almost 30 minutes of my silence did she do a double take and ask ""what's wrong? Are you upset because of the bra thing?"" And I just said yeah and tried to downplay it. 

I know I can order offline and such, the underwire just gets wider, so my boobs squish out to the sides and get folded over, whild the wire pokes my underarm fat. I felt really fat. I know I'm way overweight, but seeing my boobs squished into these ugly bras, and seeing my armpit pudge popping out on the sides of every bra, and seeing my back fat bubbling out from these new tight bands was pretty crushing. Especially in the horrible dressing room light. I know I have to lose weight, but I also know bras aren't like clothes

So we got home, put on netflix and cried in my living room. Then I curled up and fell asleep and now I'm awake at 1 in the morning and I wanted to tell somebody who would get it.

So...yes..

I know this is such a long rant, but I wanted to just vent. I really thought I would come home today happy with several new bras, feel happy and pretty and maybe even a little sexy. I didn't expect to feel fat and hopeless and feel like I should never have tried in the first place.

I went to Target (where a medium top of this description fit me with coverage to spare at a C back in the day)and I tried on two slightly different ones like that and I also found a tankini top in a medium that was pretty generous in the bust that I tried on as well. All were under $20. The XL tie-on tops fit more like a small. I felt like if I sneezed my boob would pop out. The tankini surprisingly fit well in the bust and covered things pretty well, but there was enough extra fabric around the middle that you could have fit another half of me in there! (And it was only a medium! WTF!)

I know that there are plenty of places on the internet where I can get a swimsuit top that fits. I also know that there are specialty shops that carry tops that will fit me. But the former requires knowing more than a week in advance that my friends want to take me out of town

I guess I'm just not allowed to take last-minute vacations.

Living as a Teenage Big Foot
	Hi, it’s such a taboo topic. I acknowledge that I have big feet, other people acknowledge I have big feet, but God forbid I mention it to another living, breathing organism. What a social abomination! 
	If I ever make a single complaint about my big feet, arduous, and sometimes even heinous atrocity.
	Let me present to you problemo numero uno: the looks. If I had a dollar for every time a guy looked at my feet in the hallways, even out with my boyfriend, I could pay for my entire college tuition…I'm going to a private school. Some of my favorites have to be the guy who looked at my feet through a window of a door at school. My feet weren't even suggestive: I was wearing ballet flats, you got only the slightest bit of toe cleavage. I'd honestly wear those shoes around my grandparents. The other outstandingly memorable situation was a guy at Target who actually did the movie-style check-out in which he lifted up his sunglasses and pedophically ogled to get a better look at my feet. I was wearing Nike High-Tops. There literally wasn't even anything to look at. Simply, it's annoying and unnecessary. It might make me sound like the average attention-craving, bellicose teenage girl, but unless you're a large-footed teenage girl
	Having big feet, it’s always going to be smaller than your feet. To the vast majority of boys, you're literally just a pair of feet: you're the girl in someone's math class with big feet. The girl in your check out line whose name you can’t remember even though you scanned her debit card and membership card because her only outstanding feature was her feet. Or the girl you passed in the hallway avoiding eye contact because she doesn’t want to draw attention to herself and her feet. I’ve lost count of the number of boys I’ve had conversations with that don’t make eye contact with me once. Instead, they blatantly talk to my feet. Boys, while I appreciate that you “like my anklet”, we both know you mean my feet and not my jewelry.
	And almost worse than teenage boys? Teenage girls. The catty, no matter how you say it, they don't understand the issues accompanied with big feet. They treat us like we're an entirely different class of females that should be looked down upon, that their boyfriends can’t talk to because we have big feet so we must be morally loose.
	It's also assumed that we think we're better than everyone because we have big feet. That all we do is show them off and use your feet to get ahead. There's the stereotype that girls with big feet are always, masters, and doctorate, wants to be a college professor and write a book or two and make a name for herself. Not on the list? Be someone’s trophy wife.
	To be the trophy wife stereotype, and revealing necklines. This trend is obviously demonstrated just walking through the hallways at school. Essentially, us big-footed girls have two extremes: we can wear the short skirts, tight dresses, and revealing tops everyone else wears, having them appear exponentially more inappropriate on us, or we can go to the other side and wear excessively loose shirts, and colossally humongous sweatshirts that make us look whaleish and apprehensively pusillanimous. There’s no winning either way. There’s such a small gap we have to force ourselves through to find the right clothes that don’t exceed the potential opportunity cost of throwing on sweatpants and a sweatshirt.
	On the topic of clothes: the paramount supportive shoe. It's near impossible to find a pair of shoes that fit well. They'll be long enough, you need to order shoes from Europe. Do you know how hard it is to order something that essential online without being able to try it on? Or how expensive cross-continental shipping gets? Or the different size conversion for shoes from your country to another? Or all the forms you need to fill out when you inevitably need to return items? The list of hassles is literally never ends.
	And I can’t forget the unavoidable physical activity. Gym class is like a specialized hell for girls with big feet. Volleyball? Nope. Jumping jacks? Ouch. Running? Nuh-uh. Jump roping? Don't even try it. It's so hard to find the right size sport shoe to wear that it isn't even worth it. It causes physical problems too. It starts with back problems
	As if all of that isn’t enough, gracelessly explaining that the upper part of the top is too small, only to have her say, “I KNOW, your feet are HUGE!” Or trying to go tubing with your boyfriend on his family’s boat, only to have them hand you a women’s medium life-preserving-jacket…. that is quickly switched out to a women’s large. Then to a men’s small. Men’s medium. Men’s large. And topping it off at a men’s extra large that still doesn’t close all the way. And the excessively juvenile game of basketball, in which the space between your foot and your sock is the basket and anything flickable is flicked that direction with hopes that it will land in the basket and the flicker will score a point. At which point in time this was considered acceptable, really hard. And about liking them when I’m older: yeah
	…Still think I don’t know what I’m talking about and need to just shut up and appreciate it? They do always say that you can’t understand someone else’s point of view until you walk a mile in their shoes. 
	Well, you know what they say about people with big feet… we have big socks.

I'd like to preface this rant/plea for advice with asdfghjkl. That's the verbalized version of how I feel when I try on my graduation dress

The fact is, with or without the dress. But now my mom's suggesting I should cover them up with a scarf that covers my chest completely and hangs on my belly, making me look like I'm pregnant with quadruplets.

So, right? I'm an adult, I can dress any way I want. But listening to her constant reminders of ""they're almost JUMPING at me from that dress!"" hurts me and I sort of start questioning my cleavage. Is it possible that it's too showy? Is there something wrong with showing cleavage? Am I being an attention whore or desperate or whatever? I hate this self-doubt, since I actually think the dress is the best thing I've ever purchased in my life, and without all the criticism I wouldn't even think twice and I'd just look baller on my graduation day, my own special day. Now I'm stuck thinking if I look like a slut or something and if I should cover myself up, and I don't want to think about that while partying.

And to add to this, is there any exercise I could repeat that would make them smaller?"". I honestly think she's projecting her hate of her boobs back to me, expecting me to hate my chest-baggies as well. Well, I don't!

**TLDR;** I have big boobs and lots of cleavage in my graduation dress. Mom hates her own boobs and doesn't like mine in the dress either

So

Lately, and that I should stop. One day, a girl who was a bit thinner than me, with boobs much smaller than mine was wearing the exact same dress as me. My boyfriend said she can wear that dress anytime and it's appropriate because you can't see any cleavage. 

I completely ignored his comment. He doesn't buy his own clothes, I outraged another lady with my outfit. As I was leaving she commented to her son that I was gross and that I should be ashamed of myself. I ignored the comment, but told my boyfriend about it once we were in the car. He actually agreed with her, in a way. He said that I shouldn't leave the house looking like that unless I expect some negative attention. I just can't understand this. I wasn't all done up, I had on zero make-up. I was just a lady in a tank top, what's wrong with that?

I solved this problem for myself years ago and would like to share how. Like I said in the intro the only sewing skill needed is be able to sew a button. The whole process takes about ten minutes. Sorry my shirt is so wrinkly

[My favorite shirt](http://imgur.com/a/gbWqA)

step 1: find a shirt that fits your boobs

step 2: mark with a safety pin on the shirt(or whatever will pinch the fabric for a few minutes) where your waist is the smallest.

step three: figure out how many inches smaller you would like the shirt to be (i just kinda grab the excess and guess

step four:lie the shirt flat with the back of the shirt facing you(what people see if they're standing behind you)

step five:at the smallest part of your waist (marked on the shirt) find the very center of the back then fold from both sides toward the center

step six: sew a button at the edge of the fold at the smallest part of your waist(if you want to get really picky here is where you would pin the button so you can still move it) 

step seven: on the opposite fold make a loop with a tiny bit of ribbon(make sure the button will fit through this loop without falling out) sew the ribbon down just like the button(if you're being picky pin it then button the shirt and put it on to see if you would like it tighter/looser)

step eight: iron the folds really well and it looks super cute and keeps it fitted well all day(or a couple wears if you're lazy like me)

I was ""blessed"" with high set, really, imagine two beach balls) breasts, that are firm, dense, and perky and have upward pointing nipples that are about average size. They retain this shape in and out of bras, and are shallow with very little projection. These are all natural characteristics of my breasts

I cannot wear bras comfortably. I've learned that this is the way the world works for my breasts. Because they do not, they instead push the bras into crazy positions, and push the underwire down into my ribs no matter how often I slide it back up into the inframammary fold. This doesn't get better with a tighter band-- 28s ride up on the tightest hook, and 26s kill me on the loosest hook. My cups all have excess fabric that's smooshed flat against my torso as my boobs push the wires away-- doesn't matter if it's a shallow bra like CK Tempt Me or a super projected Cleo.

Another problem is probably just because underwires don't exist to work with my breast shape. I need very wide wires, so any fabric that's up there needs to be super soft and loose, but I've not found a bra to help with that.

Every bra is painful (all 47 styles I've tried on since visiting r/abrathatfits), right? Except holy boobage. If I'm not wearing a bra, I can't walk without pain from them jiggling, because they're basically antigravity boobs, and so there's no gravity at all to hold them still. The only exception to this ""every bra is painful"" thing is my Panache Sport, but as many of you know, that's not really a bra that can be worn under clothing

I just wish my boobs were saggy, so they could fill the cups instead of mutilating them. Less relevant to bras, I wish my boobs were saggier so people didn't ask me how long ago I ""had them done"". I wish they were saggier so that I could look at the ""real breasts gallery"" and see breasts like mine. I wish they were saggy so that they'd actually look as big as they are, so people would stop saying ""They're not that big,"" or ""Just go braless-- you're not that big.""

I'm just frustrated... Sorry for the rant/sadness/immaturity, that's actually a really awkward way to say ""the grass is always greener...""). *sigh* Sometimes I wish I'd never discovered r/abrathatfits, so I could be blissfully unaware of how terrible my shape is while wearing $50 nipple hats in 34C from Victoria's Secret, not knowing that those didn't fit.",,False,self,False,t3_1jdmbm

So this is a bit of a rant

So I went to Von Maur today and started asking the lovely sales girl about the sizes they carried. She didn't believe I was bigger than a DD and insisted on fitting me. She decided I was a 38 D with some bullshit about sister sizes. 
A. How the hell could I walk in with a 34 band (that fits well) and all of a sudden by her magic math be a full 4 more inches around?!

She gives a few and I try them on and show her the band is sloppy and still my cups runneth over. She is plainly surprised and starts explaining that I should try 34DDD and 34DDDD. My cups runneth over with every bra regardless of brand. Albeit the cute Calvin Klein number was the most comfortable despite the quad boob.

After 30 minutes of trying on bras I left in tears. Even the DDD and DDDD that *almost* fit were plain and ugly. Why can't I have a pretty plunge bra that supports me? Must I only have the option of total coverage which severely limits any shirt or dress with a low neckline?

I know I have options online

I'm sad
**TLDR** Why the hell isn't there a lingerie store in every major city for big busted women?! It should be a basic human right as far as I'm concerned.

So I went to the plus size sections of the department stores, but those had almost no selection in anything below a size 20, and they were enormous in the shoulders and waist, and horrible quality. Even if I got them tailored, the cuts were not at all flattering and the material looked super cheap. 

After about six stores that had nothing that even came close to fitting, it fits properly around my boobs, and it still gives me a defined waist when it's buttoned. 

The jacket I ended up buying was a size 16, but jackets still only come in standard sizes.

So my trip to Nordstrom was a success. It's my mother I'm ranting about. She's always angry that I can't fit into ""cute"" clothes because my boobs won't fit properly in there, you'd be prettier and be able to wear prettier clothes. This doesn't fit either? Your boobs are too big. I'd love to get these clothes for you if you fit in them. Oh well.""

It's always sucked. I've always been self conscious about my breasts because of it. I wore baggy clothes trying to hide them, *out of the blue* she began to tell me that I looked good just the way I was. This freaked me out. I've never heard this from her before in my entire life. But you know what, it felt *good*, finally being validated by my own mother. I was happy. 

So this entire time, and I explain to her that I need a 34HH bra, she's pissed.

My breasts look good, they're not fine anymore. Suddenly, they've turned into these monstrous, 50 pound boobs. I mean, excuse me. They are the *same* exact boobs that you were telling me looked good. They have a different letter on them, and now you've changed your mind? Now they're too big, *again?*

As we were leaving, I don't think I'm that fat. But if these are the way my breasts are, and if they're just this large, then what am I supposed to do about it?""

I want you guys to know that this was the first time I've ever said aloud ""I'm not that fat"". All these years

But she turned to me, and say that again.""

While we walked to the car, old-people bras"" for my entire life? Why do I do this to myself? Why do I do this to her? 

At that point, and hasn't talked to me since then. She's limited our conversations to ""Welcome back home, how was school, do you want dinner?"" *She's* mad at *me*, though I can't think of what I'd done wrong, aside from being big-boobed.  I've already gone back to trying to talk to her normally, but she's still distant. I'm not apologizing

Anyway. Sorry, but I know that his sister's boobs are a subject he cares little for.

tl;dr: Bra shopping was a success; realized how important the alphabet is to my mom.

There's another that was a push up (but one of those that is 'smaller' for bigger cups) and it's got parts that rub me raw. I don't wear either of them, except the first one that I use with gym under a sports bra.

This is going to get some getting used to obviously, I'm not going to apologize for being a woman and for the breasts nature gave me. 

I understand that for many women in this sub, and I've already spent far too much money on bras that fit the first few days and then lose their shape or start hurting. I am tired of this quest for *the bra that fits*, and more and more I become convinced that I will never find it. After all, my breasts change sizes all the time, with hormonal changes, weight changes, etc. so I do not think that I have a set size. Add to this the fact that my left boob is almost a cup bigger than my right boob

Finally, and it appears that in many cases, not wearing a bra *eliminated back and shoulder pain*. Now, I've been suffering from back and neck pain for years (I'm only 20!), and I think going bra-free is something that's at least worth trying since nothing else has worked.

If anyone else would like to partake in this experiment with me

I'm looking forward to hearing what you all think!

I started out with a few 'training bras' and went straight from that to a 34C (when I was about 11 or 12 maybe?). I remember getting fitted, not wanting to draw anymore attention to myself or my chest.

Eventually, so the typical lingerie stores around here are ones such as La Senza, Aerie or La Vie En Rose. All of which are similar to Victoria Secret. I went and was fitted, and was told I was a 34D. I tried some on, and realized it was too small. The sales woman was sure that I couldn't be any larger than that, and so was my mom. They practically refused to allow me to try them on, and since my mom was the one paying

I wore them for about two years until I got so fed up with the constant spillage that I went back on my own to be fitted. Since I had bought those bras, and it felt better than my old bras, but still did not fit. I had a breakdown when I could not find a bra that actually fit, especially when I was fitted and told I would be able to wear a 34DD. I felt like a freak, and was frustrated that I was going to be so uncomfortable in my new bras. 

A few months after buying those, and found out I am likely a 32GG. Holy shit. That size exists?! I could not believe it. For one, I did not know that bras were that large. I don't know how I thought other women with breasts bigger than mine wore bras, but I just couldn't believe it. I also was surprised I was a 32, because I had *always* been a 34. I was so relieved to know that bras in my size actually existed!

After discovering my true size, there aren't a lot of places to buy bras like that. Everywhere I had been before did not have my size. I started researching things, asking questions, and eventually made progress on finding bras that fit. I currently own properly fitted bras, and it is the most amazing feeling ever. I cried when I tried on my first properly fitted bra for the first time and was able to wear it for the day and not fall out/be comfortable the entire day in it!

 I know it probably sounds stupid or petty but I HATE it when people compliment my boobs or when they're the first thing people notice. Everyone seems to think they are being nice when they tell me how ""amazing"" my big boobs are and I get that
  
Example- the other day I was with a few friends who were planning to go out that afternoon. One of them is a bi guy who has taken the role of ""sassy gay friend"" (note he himself built up this image because he enjoys it
 But it's not just that my friends constantly joke and talk about my boobs that I dislike. It's the strangers who just stare. Now I'm not talking about people who glance for a second then look away sheepishly. I'm talking about open glaring at them from across the road. While there's probably more guys than women staring they're not a particularly large majority. However the guys vary in age from about 12-70 and when I see a typical man in his late 30s staring I feel really dirty. A lot of the time with women (and of course some men) it's not even sexual; the best way of describing it is how some old people stare at tattooed
  It's worth mentioning that I'm by no means a ""slut"". I don't have the body confidence or want the attention it brings. My tops are fitted not skin-tight. I can't wear high necks because it draws more attention to the two lumps covered by straining fabric; however I don't try to show miles of cleavage either. I wear a little make-up when I go out, but I don't wear so much to make me look older. With my boobs and all I probably do appear older than I am to people I don't know but I refuse to believe I look over 17. My friends tell me it's not other peoples fault they think I'm old enough to stare at my chest, but it's not my fault either!!

*Once I was at the gym I really checked myself out in the mirrors.  The girls were nice and high; right where they are supposed to be.  I guess due to how the racer back holds/supports the girls...I look like I actually have shoulders.

I am very sensitive to the issue of categorizing large breasts with negative sexual behavior. Try replace the word ""busty"" with ""blonde"". Now it makes them seem like they're saying blonde woman are out there to steal your boyfriend. What makes it any more acceptable to say that about women with large breasts?

I knew I would have to order online because stores don't carry my size.  I decided to measure myself using the guide in the margin.  I measure at a 45"" underbust (yes, overweight and 6' tall, please don't judge) and my breasts measure 59"" standing with my back parallel to the floor like the guide says.  I measured standing, just in case my breasts were a bit pendulous, and I got 56"" so maybe average would be 58""?  So according to the chart I'm a UK 44JJ (US 44N).

I can't even find that size in places I might have shopped before online.  I don't even know where to go.

So I hate bras. They hurt, so I can't really walk around without a bra on. I mean, I could, but it doesn't look very flattering.

If I lie down, or just try to relax

So my question is: is this normal? People keep telling me it's not normal, but I can't find a nice-looking wireless bra in my size.

Also, so the boobs aren't really proportionate, so that probably doesn't help.

I love backless dresses but find it so hard to support my boobs (or atleast stop them from looking saggy) in so many designs that bras are impossible for. I recently went on a giant ASOS spree and this dress was delivered. As soon as I put it on I loved it and I couldn't get over how great my boobs looked in it. It is a little funny with the straps; they are circles that slip around your shoulder but they are very comfortable.

There are some obvious solutions, instead of morning, so I won't dwell on those.

1. Witch hazel solution. Typically used for all kinds of irritations and inflammations, and if used regularly, it's incredibly effective at PREVENTING any potential irritations.  Once or twice a day (preferably after a shower) saturate a cotton ball with it and wipe under and between the breasts.

So far, by the way, wearing a bra that didn't fit her (it was even obvious through her clothing). In the original post I spent the first day wearing a spaghetti strap tank top with a supportive layer underneath. Then I ditched that, and started wearing tight tank tops underneath my t-shirts. Now I wear nothing at all underneath my t-shirts most of the time. I usually wear a light scarf around my neck, which provides some coverage for my nipples. Some t-shirts look a lot better than others, namely the ones that are made of loose, soft fabric and with a low v-neck or u-neck. Of course going bra free requires me to re-learn how to dress to some extent, but I'm completely ok with that. Fashion for women with big boobs is difficult with or without bras.

My boobs do not hurt, the pain and discomfort never completely disappeared, and I could never find a bra that fit me according to the guidelines from /r/abrathatfits. Now I no longer feel pain in my boobs. It's as if they were no longer even an issue. They get in the way much less now that I no longer wear a bra, and I barely notice them; they are like any other part of my body.

The other day, so the whole thing felt quite natural. Will you believe me if I tell you I was also on my period? Well I was, and I felt *no pain in my boobs*. It was not even uncomfortable, and they didn't bounce all that much. Probably the fact that I was running barefoot helped with that, since it's a lot smoother and doesn't send shock waves through the body like heel striking with bulky shoes does. In fact I barely noticed my boobs, and instead I was able to focus on the new and interesting experience of barefoot running. 

I don't think people are put off by my bralessness

Now, I had been on a quest to find a bra that fits for many years, spending hundreds of dollars along the way on bras that would become either stretched and useless a few months later, or too small because my boobs would have outgrown them. I feel liberated now that I have abandoned this quest, and I think my boobs are ever-grateful. I have come to appreciate them much more now, and I accept that they do not look like big melons right below my chin (I just noticed that's exactly what the logo for this subreddit looks like). Rather, they ""sag"", but that's fine. Gravity happens

If you have questions

I followed the instructions and measured myself. According to the instructions, though, I got 37"" translating to a cup size of K/H (US/UK, respectively)!

The band doesn't ride up my back, shoulder straps don't dig in, and I don't spill or fall out of the cups all the time.

My mom has rather small breasts (she currently wears a 34B but I'm not sure how true to size it is. She's that or a 32C, along with some German and his father was a second generation Lithuanian immigrant)

When I hit puberty when I was 12, I went braless. When I got back, my mom's immediate reaction was *Where the hell did those things come from* along with just shock. I was about 100lbs when I left, and 130 coming back. My mother took me bra shopping, when we determined that I was a 34C. We ordered Barely Breezies and bought various bras along with 2 sports bras. I ended up having to wear both my strapless molded bra **and** a one of the sports bras, just to feel somewhat secure. Until we bought these about mid-way through seventh grade, **I was still wearing 34B bras**. That includes during gym. I remember one of the girls commenting on my ""poor boobies"" because they were popping out all over the place. I felt terrible in anything I wore. My one girl friend said to me once, like how do they even have ribcages that tiny!""

Eventually I convinced my mom to let me go to Victoria's Secret. No one helped me and I determined that I was now, because the straps weren't fully adjustable.  I got 2 push up bras, the only kind I found that could even sustain the weight of my breasts! I hated my bras. I had to make the straps super short to try to make up for the lack of support in the band, the band was constantly riding up on the 3rd hook, and my breasts would literally fall out of the cups. I had to constantly put them back in. I learned to just deal with it for a while. I only had 2 bras really in that size so they got used quite a bit. And for a while, I really really coveted VS. I was so excited to have these pretty bras that actually ""fit"" me!

Then one day, ""You're a 34 *almost* C"" my respect immediately flew out the window. She gave me some 34Cs to try on and she asked how they fit. I showed her, and she went, ""Oh. I guess you're a 34D then. Hmm.""
I continued buying bras from them because I didn't think I had options.

Then about a year ago, and double bras, and my newly pierced nipples getting caught on the edge of my cups, I'd had enough. I started looking into how to determine your cup size, and was shocked. Looking back I still am. Even if I'd done the +4 method I'd still have been a 34E.

About 2 weeks ago I finally, and a 28G. I think my best fit will be 28GG if I can ever get a hold of it. I've spent a lot of time educating women I know about their sizes and debunking a lot of misconceptions about breasts and bra sizes, so much to the point of starting my own blog. But really, just in the week or some of switching over I'm NEVER going back. The difference is amazing. I have less back pain, my straps no longer painfully dig in, I feel supported, and my boobs actually look bigger in a bra with no padding. Every once in a while I would realize how large they are and ask my boyfriend if they were really that big, they are. I'm so use to them being squished and pushed out and all over the place.

I'm new to this subreddit, 40 F/G, 5'0"". I have a reduction scheduled for December 19th of this year. This is absolutely final. This is something I've wanted to do for about six or seven years now, and I have no doubts in my my mind or debate about it. 

Obviously I spoke to my doctor, problems with breast feeding, etc... what I what to know about is how it feels. What was it really like when you first woke up from the surgery? My biggest fear is that I'm going to wake up and... they're still going to seem huge. Did you feel the difference right away?

How long, and while I don't expect to be partying it up, were you in an okay state at that time? How soon did you drive? Did you take any painkillers?

Lastly... did people say anything to you after you had the surgery? Obviously people seem to feel it's within their rights to comment on my large breasts, and how you responded.

Any feedback would be great. I don't know anyone else who has had the surgery,False,self,t5_2ubfr,False,,,t3_10sqn4

I'm kinda lazy so I usually travel in jammies and a sports bra...wish I had stuck with that today! I lurve Nordstrom bras because they are well-made and come in my size...but I'm not flying in one again! Might even write them a letter about it eventually.

My nearest Bravissimio is two hours away by train and there are no lingerie shops in my area or surrounding counties to cater for bigger busted ladies. I figure that there's a gap in the market that I could fill. I'm going to starting up seminars over this week and have looked at the government guides to starting up a business.

I think what I'm looking for is some emotional support! I'm nervous and though I've done quite a bit of research I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. What would you ladies be looking for in a bra shop? I'd probably be looking to cater for something like 28D to 40J/L but I'm not sure how probable that is! I'm feeling a little lost and scared as I've never thought about anything like this before.

What I do know is that I'm getting a bit tired of ordering bras online, I want everyone to have a well fitting bra and not feel bad about what size they are after an ill-informed fitting. Our breasts are a big part of our lives and we spend a lot of money on them. I want people to be able to walk about of a fitting room feeling happy and normal, and to walk out of a shop with at least one well-fitting and pretty bra. I want to make people feel confident in their bodies and confident in bras that fit.
