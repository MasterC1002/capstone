EDIT:

I did not expect this thread to blow up. In all seriousness. I will try to answer questions / address the haters. But to be honest the hate is only motivating to make even more progress because I did not intend to make the photos look enhanced in any way. They were purely for my own use and I wanted to try out the poses the fitness models use to compare my body to that physique. So I did

The reality is that most ""fitspiration"" and ""hardbodies"" type photos are tilted, so I thought I should return the favor. 

I can't be bothered at the moment to take another photo, here are three pics side by side from the same times, just different leg pose. I assure you I was not holding my ass up with my hands either... which hopefully the second photo proves. The third photo was intended to be a back photo, and I am not ""tilting"" my pelvis. The fourth photo was intended as a pose. 

[ A different rear view] (http://imgur.com/6GwfWvY)


So, deadlift, bench, overhead press. I would do split workouts and focus on a muscle group each day. In the beginning leg days looked like this:


*Squats 3 x 5* 

*Single leg split-squats BW + 15 lb dumbbells 3 x 5* 

*Leg press 3 x 8*

*Romanian deadlifts 3 x 8*

*Back extensions BW + holding 25lb plate*

My current squat 1RM is **165lb**

I did this for about the first 5 months

My cardio is sprinting on the treadmill in intervals one-two times per week

So I started weightlifting almost one year after my brother tragically passed away from a heart attack. He was 29 at the time, he was a king amongst men. Valhalla has him now, and I know he has a chair waiting for me. But it was a jolt, a realization. Your health is not only meaningful to you, but other people. Your livelihood and health are not only detrimental to you, but the ones you love. It made me feel like I was being selfish because I saw how his death affected not only me, my family

 I will be very honest when I say, which was way easier than I thought. I started eating way more protein and lifted as heavy as I could. I never ever ran before. My thought was, unless the cops were chasing I wasnt running. Last month I finished my first 5k ever under 30 minutes. Yeah....I didnt know squatting could help that. I plan on another 5k next month. I started cardio within the past two months, never did it prior

I didnt like my clothes feeling tighter and the scale didnt more. 

It was muscle. It was the muscle forming under my fat, don't believe gimmicks, your overweight coworker, your crazy aunt that buys all that infomercial shit, or anyone else that can't physically prove it.

It's been a really, I had a gastric bypass. It's the best thing I've ever done, because it gave me the tool to be able to take care of myself. After the first 30 or 40 came off, I was able to exercise without hurting myself.

I went from being able to do only water aerobics and 20 minutes on a recumbent bike to now, and doing my first Tough Mudder in November. This from the girl who hid in gym class, and couldn't even run 1/8 a mile when I was 12.

I literally wear smaller pants now than I did in 6th grade. And I'm more fit than I was at 10! That completely boggles my mind.

I'm working on building strength and endurance

So, 10 years ago I never in a million years thought my life would be what it is now. I was sure I was doomed to an early grave, years of sadness, and that was just the way it was going to be. It wasn't overnight, and it's taken a TON of work, but things can change. Day by day.

First let me start off by saying this is nothing more than me giving my experience, leanness, fitspo, ect. I am more than happy to answer questions the best I can and just be honest with you all because I think it is important to hear from someone who actually does it. I feel like bodybuilders/fitness models/ whatever else get a really bad wrap around here. 

I started my journey of competing about a year ago (three years total of weightlifting under my belt now) I went to the Arnold Classic in Columbus

[This](http://imgur.com/gp2gx) was me when I started. I weighed 138 lbs and was 28% BF. I lifted three times a week with complex movements and basically ate whatever I wanted. I hired a coach and started competing last October. Since then I have had been successful in my competing, and have been in a posing DVD. 

[First show](http://imgur.com/D8VO3) 

[Back shot bc this is prob what has changed more than anything haha](http://imgur.com/nryPd)

[Second show]( http://imgur.com/kKFMa) 

[Offically a ninja](http://imgur.com/FsXDw)

I fell in love with competing. I enjoyed the entire process from getting tan, to the life long friends that you make during this, the fact that you learn a lot about yourself and your capabilities, to overcoming your mental barriers, and yes I loved the intense training. 

I took a short time off

[Front](http://imgur.com/cRgiPe7)

[I am on the right end with the long blonde hair](http://imgur.com/1kJ7oSA)

Between those two times I was doing a ton less cardio, ect. 

Why was I able to do this? Because I lowered my set rate. I stayed 5-7 lbs within my stage weight and my body adapted to that. It became more efficient and I had a higher metabolic set rate. I decided to try my luck at Nationals. 

[Nationals](http://imgur.com/xkSZj2n) 

[Photoshoot from Nationals](http://instagram.com/p/a0ovguhdPb/) 

At Nationals I was around 10% BF. I still had my period, I only felt exhausted when I was working hours back to back as an ICU RN until midnight. Other than that I felt good. 

After this I officially went into my off season. I am up 7 lbs from my stage weight of 121 lbs. I am doing NO cardio. And I am in the gym five times a week for about an hour. I am eating around 2600+ calories average daily

**A few things that I would like to address**

* You can get lean safely, and my best bud WBFF pro http://instagram.com/hylaconrad. 

* Staying stage lean is difficult, make improvements, and most importantly get your metabolic rate as high as you can for the next time you cut. So many people do not do this, and this is where you get into problems later on. (If you are up to date on Layne Norton's things) 

* Having a solid foundation of muscle and knowledge of lifting will help you more than anything. I see so many girls who start competing or wanting to get lean who really don't have any muscle. If you take a year and get a foundation of muscle before you attempt to start cutting you will better off. 

* You can live a normal life and still do this shit. Most people I know many things before a competitor. They are mothers, whatever. We make TIME because this is important to us. I went to parties, holidays, whatever. Did I drink? No. I was okay with that my personal goals were. Did I bring my food? Yes. The people who love you will not care. It is a matter of determining what is important to you at that time. 

* Consistency is the vital to any success weather you want to be lean

* If our off season many of us do a combo of IIFYM and 'clean'(stupid word) eating. I eat ice cream

* Slow and steady wins the race. Don't rush into all this. Slow steady gains

* EAT YOUR FOOD. PLEASE. I beg you. Eat. &lt;3 Your body will thank you.

* Most fitness inspiration things are taken when people have prepped. But a lot of times people will give the model 2 weeks and sometimes more in advance so they can prep for them. Which is why so many of us stay 5-10 lbs within stage weight. 


**Take away point tl;dr** It is possible to make major changes to your body. It is possible to do reach your goals, or stupid in our training and dieting. There is a reason for off season  &lt;3! 

Has it all been worth it to me? yes

Yesterday I was shown a diet a girl was given by her trainer. Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/fzI2vIX.jpg

I was immediately shocked and afraid for this girl's well-being. At most this diet consists of around 1000 calories if the protein the girl eats is beef...but closer to around 800 calories if the protein is chicken or fish. The trainer has her on a 6 day split with cardio and strength training. **This is scary.** This girl is going to drive herself into the ground and destroy her body along the way. 

It got me thinking about you all, or just fitness that they realize that **a fitness journey is not a sprint, it's a long-distance race.**

I'm competing in an NPC Bikini competition in 13.5 weeks and my diet is NOWHERE NEAR this extreme. I am still eating about 1900 calories a day! You can follow my journey **on Instagram @ohilyssa** or here: //http://ilyssagetsfit.blogspot.com/

1375652419.0,1jp9b9,How to use your hormones to help you lose weight: a very short primer.,georgiabiker,320,67,102,"So, act

* The first **2 weeks** of your cycle (starting with day one of your period) is dominated by **estrogen.** Estrogen can make you gregarious, enthusiastic. It *can* make some people a little too high-strung.

* Ovulation happens approximately 12-16 days before your period. (So if you're like me and have a 32-35 day cycle

* After ovulation, and instead of maniacally running around, you're prone to want to stay in. You feel pretty good about life. *Some* few people may get too demotivated and interpret this as depression. But I LOVE progesterone. I feel like the world is A-OK during this time.

**A DROP IN HORMONES IS WHAT BRINGS THE CRAY**

Now, both of your hormones plummet before one or the other takes over. And it's the sudden drop in hormones that actually makes us feel the worst. Grumpy as hell for no reason? Something you loved one day looks terrible today? It's probably your hormones. All wound up- is it a high estrogen time? Chillaxing to the max- is progesterone in the house? Raging/ Crying/ the world SUCKS: have both of your major hormones left the building? See, you're not as crazy or unpredictable as you've maybe been thinking. You just didn't know that it was the lack of hormones that made you a little crazy.

**[HOW THIS AFFECTS YOUR DIET:](http://www.thevenusweek.com/about-venus-week/big-three-hormones/)**


* ESTROGEN
So, you're more sensitive to insulin, and you automatically assume a diet that will make you lose almost pound a week. Awesome! 

VS.

* PROGESTERONE
When progesterone dominates, and, well...here come the love handles!


So! Our lesson here is this. **Start your diet in the first two weeks of your period.** 

You'll not only be feeling energized to work out and motivated and sharp, you hopefully will have some success and enough momentum to make it through the tougher (dieting-wise) two weeks later in the month. ALSO now that we are more self-aware of the fact that it's just those pesky hormones, it should be a lot easier to recognize when they are making you reach for the brownies and put the brakes on it. You can do it! You can work WITH your body to lose weight. I hope you guys enjoyed this and that it was clear enough and had enough references. I'm pooped from the gym but can add more later if you want. &lt;3 xoxoxo!

Edit: this is 100% OC

Second Edit: Get the iphone/ ipad app **[""Period Horoscope""](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mood-horoscope-period-tracker/id498355157?mt=8).** Enter the first day of your period. It's awesome and will tell you where you are in your period. I used it and found out I have a really long cycle (32-36 days). Just reset it when you get your next period.

Yesterday morning we received a call from my mother-in-law

His eagerness to be fit and healthy

For some reason I took this news harder than my husband. I cried and cried. And then I was empty. I couldn't understand that someone I loved so much could die that way--trying so hard to be better. 

I don't know how to mourn. I still don't even know how to mourn the death of my own father 20 years later. I'm bad at facing emotions.

I cried because I loved my father-in-law

I run for those who can't. I run because I can't face life without the strength that I know is inside of me--I am everything that I make myself out to be. 

I lifted heavier than I thought possible. I couldn't believe the strength that was emanating out of my body--the power that I never thought possible. I mourned through physical exhaustion. I mourned by completely obliterating my body until my mind was numb to mental clutter.

**1. Remove the crap from your kitchen:** You know what I mean. Try to remove crisps, etc. from your kitchen and do NOT buy it at the supermarket. If you're in a situation where you can't chuck stuff out (e.g. living with people who aren't changing their lifestyle) then try tip 2...

**2. Hide any tempting snacks out of sight:** When snacks are visible you are so

**3. Use a shopping list and eat before grocery shopping:** Supermarkets and stores are quite literally designed to make you buy more. Ever noticed the chocolates near the checkouts? It's not an accident - my first job was as a checkout chick and our management called it the ""Impulse Bar"". Use a shopping list and stick to it to the letter. Eating a meal before you go will also reduce impulse buying!

**4. Prepare meals in bulk:** Not only are homecooked meals less likely to contain a whole range of chemicals and preservatives, stews, curry, stir-fry and sauces. If you like salads, why not prepare some diced beef or chicken with a sauce of your choice (e.g. Teriyaki chicken) to reheat and pour over fresh-bought veges throughout the week? It gives you a hot salad that will hit the spot and be much more beneficial than pairing them with rice. 

**5. Prepare healthy snacks in advance - make them visible and easy:** You can also pre-prepare snacks by buying a large packet of nuts, convenient, and healthy option close by!

**6. Use smaller plates and dishes to control portion size:**  Here's an experiment for you... Get two bananas, and it will communicate that info to your stomach. This is a simple and terrific way of improving portion control.

**7. Use your calorie tracker as a meal planner:** If you don't have time/patience to enter your meals after you eat each mouthful

**8. Start tracking at your biggest meal of the day:** Although it takes some fiddling, if you go overboard on dinner, you can dial back your breakfast and lunch the next day to compensate, since that will likely be more comfortable for you than scaling back dinner.

**9. Make one change at a time:** It can be tempting to turn around one day and think ""Right! I suck at this eating business - I'm going to eat salads for every meal and only drink water and track everything and it'll be wonderful!"". Bzzzzzt - wrong! This so rarely works, moving onto the next goal. It's slow, but it will be effective. Other steps you can take (one by one!) to clean up your diet and/or portion sizes include: 

- add another serving of veges to whatever you eat now
- cutting down your 'empty' carb servings
- cutting down on alcohol intake
- drinking more water (instead of soft drink
- drink green tea instead of milky/sugary coffee drinks
- track your protein intake and aim for at least 0.8x your body weight in lbs
- try to keep your sugar intake under 50g per day
- serve your meat with extra veges instead of rice/bread/pasta
- replace rice with cauliflower rice (grated cauliflower fried in a pan with some oil/onion)
- replace pasta with spaghetti squash
- reduce the amount of butter
- substitute unhealthy snacks with protein bars, etc.

**10. Use the 90/10 or 80/20 guideline - also known as ""Don't sweat the small stuff!"":** The 90/10 guideline is basically that you eat good stuff for 90% of your calories, or save up your 10% to have one or two meals each week which don't fit into your eating plan. Enjoy life and don't be disappointed if you have a crap day! 

##Health is a journey, and don't beat yourself up when it's not quite working!

On a personal note: I've had mini holidays where I've eaten double my caloric needs for almost a week and gotten totally carried away. I enjoyed it

Just do what you can - *every little change and every little healthy decision is an improvement on doing nothing at all* :-) You're heading in the right direction and we're here for you when/if you fuck up and fall off the bandwagon. HUGS WILL BE FORTHCOMING!

I honestly didn't have much of an appetite after the breakup, and once my ankle (that I'd sprained right before the breakup) felt healed up I started doing C25k again, 2 weeks ago. I'm pretty active, as I work a very busy retail job. I never stand still or sit down for 8 hours, and then I walk to and from work (about 45-ish minutes total). 

Currently I'm still doing my C25k, right now. I'm also trying to decide between yoga or sit-ups/crunches on my off days. Input?

A typical non-rest day:

**Breakfast**:

* 1 glass orange juice &amp; toast with avocado **or** 

* 1/2 cup 0% Greek yogurt with 1/4 tsp all natural raw whipped honey **or**

* 1/2 cup Vitamin D milk (haven't gone pure on that yet) with one of four whole grain all natural cereals in my cupboard

Work for 8 hours

**Lunch**:

* Sandwich on nuts and seeds bread with 1T hummus, 1/4c orange bell pepper, 1/4c spinach, and 1 1/4"" slice of heirloom tomato (all the above is organic and locally grown) **and**

* A piece of fruit from a produce stand near work **and**

* 1/2c whole sugar peas (hull and all) **or**

* 8oz chilled gazpacho soup with a little olive oil

**Exercise**: 

* warm up stretch for 30m

* run/walk in intervals according to C25k program; usually get about 2.5 miles in 30m

**Dinner**:

* More yogurt

* Sometimes I'll fry up some tofu in a little olive oil with cooked spinach and an egg

**And y'all

I'd love critique. My diet isn't that great; I totally know that. I definitely need more protein. Also just any suggestions in general would rock

**My goals:**

* I want to run a 5k by September (when our wedding was supposed to be), and a half marathon by April (our anniversary). 

* I want to get to 175lbs (my weight when I started college) by September, and 130 by April (100lbs down total!)

* Once I start school in September I'll have gym access and will start weight training; I'll worry about creating goals for that when I find out what I can do. For now: a fun thing I've been doing is making extra effort to lift heavy things at work

**TL;DR**: from May 9th 2013 - July 7th 2013, down two band sizes in my bra, and can now run/walk 2.5mi without issue.

Many of you will remember this post [1] http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r7rrc/ladies_personal_proof_that_lifting_will_not_make/

Here was the initial progress pic

Updated photo! Left: Dec 2009 Right: Sept 2012 [3] http://imgur.com/kVzRY 

6 months ago I was 132 lbs and a size medium. I am now 133lbs and a size small.

Lifts that I have recorded so far:

    1RM Dead Lift: 180#
    2RM Front Squat: 125#
    2RM Back Squat: 120#
    2RM Push Press: 80#
    1RM Squat Snatch (most frustrating movement): 70#
    3RM Bench Press: 95 lbs

I find it odd my FS is heavier than my BS, nonetheless.

To give an example of progression, so my progress may not be the most rapid, and I am okay with that.

Below are some more photos, workout regimen, and a little happy/sad story:

Just a front

And, front squats, squat cleans, squat snatches, and air squats. Squats. Squats. Squats. It might not be the prime pick of the crop in terms of asses, because, well

So what did I do to get to where I am now? Well, most importantly, kept my diet clean. I cannot stress the importance of nutrition enough.

My diet, wings, and dark chocolate. Personally, I am miserable with restriction. I allow myself some treats here and there because it makes me happy. I don't gorge on food - I savor it. That understanding, that relationship with food, took a long time to construct. If you're eating shit food and want to eat healthier, it's best to incorporate those changes slowly so that the replacement is long term rather than short term. It isn't a diet - it's a lifestyle change. Take a few things out per week and allow your body to acclimate to the healthier changes. When grocery shopping, fresh food and cook it yourself with spices that don't contain chemicals or sugars. I eat about 90% Paleo.

From the point that I made that post 6 months ago I ended up getting my heart broken to pieces, maybe 4x a week. I stepped it up a notch in August and have been going 3-5 days a week. My box also offers pure strength training classes in the mornings which I have been attending as well. Lifting weights is the best thing to happen to me in a long time, maybe even my entire life!

And last, he was going away for a car show and I ended up not going out for my birthday, never wearing the dress. To make a long story short, he was actually with another girl at that car show, a girl he was sleeping with for a large quantity of the time that I was with him, even sleeping with her the same day he spent time with me. I found out, he confessed, a month ago I decided I wanted to go out for my birthday and finally wear the dress. The problem was

Okay, just would like that stubborn last bit of fat to go away because I have worked hard to build muscle and would like that to show. I will be upping my cardio in the meantime to see if that helps.

--------------------------

I think I've hit a bit of a plateau, measuring tape, and pictures show a difference... I don't feel different *at all*.  Perhaps I will once I get below 200 pounds.

I'm not entirely certain what it is that finally galvinized me to change.  I've always been ""big, horizontally.  A lot of my relatives are tall).  But I have never identified myself by my body; always with my brain, actions, and bank account.  So while I haven't been *happy* with my body, it hasn't particularly been a source of anguish.  I have successfully lost weight in the past; I got down to a healthy BMI for a while in high school, but the weight crept back on through the years.

I've heard that lifestyle changes are easier to make when they happen in conjunction with other large life changes.  So when I moved and switched jobs, but if I continued to be so overweight he wasn't sure how physically attracted he would be to me years from now), and possibly other forgotten factors, and the result is where I am now.

Here's the lifestyle changes I've made:

**August

Got a job in the city

**September**

Got a bike mid-September.  Immediately became a full-time bike commuter.  10 miles round trip

**October**

Stopped eating the free unhealthy snacks at work

**November**

Woke up at 5:30am three days a week for a 5 week kettlebell class that I got off of groupon.  Loved it

**December**

Joined a gym near work.  Did unorganized

**January**

Started the program laid out in ""New Rules of Lifting for Women"".  

-----------------------

My current exercise schedule (beyond the 55+ miles a week I get from riding my bike *everywhere*) is:

**Monday**: Lift.

**Tuesday**: Cardio kickboxing.

**Wednesday**: Rest.

**Thursday**: Lift during lunch.  Yoga after work.

**Friday**: Rest.

**Saturday**: Lift.

**Sunday**: Rest.

I got into resistance training senior year of high school, wondering why at 5' 5"" and 125 lbs, I didn't look the way I wanted to. I was working out 2-3 hours a day and eating nothing just to maintain a body I wasn't happy with. My immune system was shot, I was moody and sad and miserable and sick all the time.

Eventually, within those 2 years I managed to put on 25 lbs of pure chunk (bringing me to about 150) and lost any semblance of fitness that I once had. My body hatred started to creep back when I'd see myself in photos or I'd have to put on a pair of shorts that fit the year before. Unhappy with myself, I reverted back to my old ways. 1200 calories a day, 5 hour long spinning classes a week, 3 or hour long elliptical sessions a week. I lost weight (went from 150 to 132), but I felt like shit. I was afraid to go out to dinner with my boyfriend, I would cancel plans with friends so I could make a spinning class, but it was consuming my entire life on a way that made me

I don't know when it happened or what triggered it, but I've given myself much more leeway (1600 on normal days, 2000 on weight days) and don't beat myself up when I go 50-100 calories over.  I don't keep myself from going out with friends for fear of going over my calorie goals, I just don't go out every night.

And I've seen serious results. I didn't expect much from a 2 day a week routine, **4** inches from my lower stomach/hip area, and 2 inches from my butt. Note I'm counting in inches, because I've actually gained 8 lbs.

I'm in my early teens (think *super* early) and I've always been 'the fat kid'. I was always told, I was unmotivated to do *anything* about my generally unhealthy state. I was waiting for the day when BAM, no more blubber! Just sitting around. Eating to pass the time. Waiting.

Until one day last year I realized

I ran several miles a day under the friggin' hot southern sun, acting in an outdoor drama. I lost thirty pounds in three months. I'm trying to fix my broken self-esteem. I'm trying to improve myself more and more every day. I'm working really hard to be healthy and comfortable in my own skin, at the same time. 

But then people that I haven't seen in a couple of years will come up to me and say

And then I want to scream.

I was living an unhealthy lifestyle, it wasn't because I'm 'maturing'. It's because I put forth effort.

And you know, an infant - because they usually actually DO grow into their flub and extra skin. Otherwise - you are *probably* over weight, and you should at least be moderately motivated to do something about it.

First off, I would still love to hear your opinion. 


In brief, damn, what is she talking about? The new aesthetic of impeccable leanness seems as tyrannical as that of perfect thinness that we're so proud of rejecting. 


I worry that this trend could prompt vulnerable girls and women to see flaws where there is beauty, more muscular-looking body *can* be a sign of improved health. But what starts as dedication too often turns to unhealthy preoccupation with appearance. I don't want any woman to feel that she needs to achieve that look, or *any* particular look, and many of the new posters here seem to feel that they should. Fitness, IMO, is mainly about long-term health, mental well-being, and many other non-aesthetic benefits. You do not have to look a certain way to be beautiful

However, or do a half squat (not go to parallel). And today was no different in terms of my confidence. I wasn't even planning on maxing today!! My boyfriend/lifting partner is gone for the weekend so he wasn't there with me, and my other lifting buddy had to bail. So it was just me, the bar, and a rather nice gym employee who rallied me on. 

**My training program** is just something my parents had me do when I was younger, I settle for doing low weight and high rep sets (sets of 10-15 reps). If I'm feeling good, or feeling particularly naughty, I'll do heavy sets of 3 or 5 (also dependent on how the heavier weight is feeling to me). Whether I'm doing a light day or heavy day, I always do two or three warm up sets.

How it normally goes though is this:

**Light Day**

+ Warm up: 45lbs (naked bar) x 10 reps (just to limber up)

+ Warm up: 95lbs x 10 reps

+ Working Sets (repeat 4-5 times): 135lbs x 12-15 reps or 145lbs x 12-15reps

+ Kill yo 'self: 95lbs x failure

**Heavy Day:**

+ Warm up: 45lbs x 10 (limberin' up yo)

+ Warm up: 115lbs x 5

+ Warm up: 145lbs x 5

+ Working Set (repeat 4-5 times): 165lbs x 5 **or** 185 x 3 (unfortunately I can only really achieve 185lbs x 3 when I have a spotter...confidence issues haha)

+ Kill yo 'self: 135lbs x 8-10

**Today** this is what I did:

+ 45lbs x 10, 185x1, 200x1, 145x8, 145x8, 145x8, 135x10

+ Leg press and calf raises on leg press between each squat set, 200x10, 250x8, 250x8, 250x8, 200x10 **Calf raises:** same as weights as leg press, except 10 reps for every set.

Typically

ANYWAY

My whole life, overeating and lack of exercise made my weight spiral out of control in the summer of 2010. I injured my knee because of the extra weight I was carrying on it and was unable to keep up with the kids at the summer camp at which I was instructing.

When I got home in September, but it did allow me to drop pounds dramatically. At the start of the summer of 2011, I was down 30 pounds to about 153, but hitting a plateau. Being a cardio bunny wasn't doing me any favours, and I was unwilling to restrict my food intake. Carbs have always been my favourites and I would binge on cookies and pasta.

A broken wrist and lack of motivation made it so that I hovered at my plateau of 150-155 for almost a full year. I was only able to start breaking through it starting September 2012

The last step to my weight loss was joining myfitnesspal in November. It's been a lifesaver! As a data junkie

At the moment, and although I try to keep them in check I do love my food. I lift three days a week, long sessions with a ton of accessory work. A next step is moving onto a split schedule, since right now my weights days include so much accessory work that I'm at the gym for at least an hour and a half. Here are my stats for lifting:

Bench: 3x5 at 85 lbs

Squat: 3x5 at 120 lbs

Deadlift: 3x5 at 135 lbs

I also do three days a week of cardio, complexes, rowing or whatever my body is craving. 

Next steps: keep cutting until I lose the rest of my stomach and saddlebags

I looked at my legs and thought maybe I should go home to change so nobody would make fun of my bony legs. I decided to just go get a beer. I tied a sweatshirt around my waist. Well, which is ridiculous and downright laughable. I was wearing a turtleneck in the driver's license picture, and my hair and makeup were done to perfection because you only get a new picture every eight years, so I wanted my photo to look good.

I rolled my eyes and as she got up to leave she said, ""God bless you. I hope you make it through the year.""

Later in the stretch room I saw the same pair going over the work they just did while the trainer let the girl through some cool down exercises. In their conversation the girl said this, I know I should be *working much harder* [at fitness or whatever]."" 

And at that moment the trainer got this look on her face. This exasperated look. Like she knew that something she'd just been trying to teach got lost along the way. 

I knew what the trainer was thinking because I've see this hardcore attitude a lot among my own female friends who start working out when they realize they're a bit chunkier than they wanted to be. It's the attitude that since they're now overweight

So they pile on with the dieting and the working out every single say of the week and usually one or two things happens

I've read a lot of posts here going along the lines of 'I'm overweight and don't do anything

***

I know going from 0-60 works for some people, I wonder if deciding you're going to take up some kind of hardcore cardio program from being completely sedentary isn't getting a little ahead of yourself, because in my personal experience the people who get the best results are **very carefully incremental about their fitness goals.**

Being unfit is a lot like starting at level one in a video game. It doesn't take much to get to level two, but before you break level ten all you really need to do is show up, get out, walk around a little, work on your form, and your progress will be exponential. It's a good time, you'll never get such good results for comparatively little work again. 

So if you're sedentary, first start by cooking your own balanced means more often. No need for the diets and the crazy training programs. It's good to learn and have goals for yourself but when you start fitness the real work is in trying to do these good little habits consistently, not forcing yourself to strive past all reasonable levels of endurance all the time. Maybe at some point you'll want to do that, but as a beginner is not the time. Always make fitness first something that you can enjoy as a part of your life, not a responsibility that saps all your vitality and joy. 

Being incremental is good for two reasons, you actually develop the body awareness that is going to help you to not get injured when you try harder things. Don't get injured, it sucks. And don't burn out.

I have been here

For several years I've been a pretty dedicated athlete. I workout 6 days a week and most days I do at least 45min of cardio + 25-45min of strength and weights

I really believed that 1200 calories was supposed to be enough for me

Finally. I reached my limit. I was depressed, irritable, no sex drive, and not making any progress in my fitness. I was finding it harder and harder to maintain the 6 workout days, and I pulled out of 2 races this year. So, I started researching... I read, and read

Today it's been 8 days of eating about 2000 calories a day. I'm sleeping better, thinking about food less, and feeling SO much happier. My body is sort of freaking out. I'm a little bloated, I've got some new fat around my middle, but apparently this is all part of the healing process and it could take months for me to lean out again. My weight has seemed to stabilize after an initial week of pretty gnarly bloating and whatnot. 

Right now my focus is on body recomposition.

Earlier this evening I was out for a jog by the beach, and there's a wide sidewalk by a winding road. Well-lit, relatively safe area. People from Boston probably know exactly where I am talking about. You'll see all types and sizes of people out in this area. While my spare tire has made me a little self-conscious about being seen by the people down there who obviously run the marathon, I haven't let it get to me. 

So I jogged a few miles and my left leg shin splints kicked in. I'd felt them mildly a few times before but this time they were worse than I've ever felt (I think because I'm able to run faster/farther now), but as a rule I keep my distance from other people to be respectful and hopefully go unnoticed. I kept jogging to get by them without delay. As I jogged by the group, this teenage kid started jogging beside me, in pace with me, flailing his arms and imitating my sore gait. He followed me for a short ways then turned back to the rest of the group of shitbags, who laughed. 

Like yea

As an introvert this was a nightmare. As a native Bostonian I wanted to flip him off or tell him to go fuck himself (as I've been wont to do)

When I got back to my apartment

If the world could just stop pointing out that I'm not the correct weight while I'm desperately trying to fix it

It was so discouraging. It makes me want to never go jogging that way again

I know I'm way too sensitive and I take things way too hard. When I see an overweight or obese person exercising I think ""hey good for him/her

Sorry for the needlessly long explanation

My stats 2 years ago

Currently (first pic

-------------

I went from the photo on the left to the photo on the right in a span of two years. It took a whole lifestyle change, tears and dedication to get to where I am now. Being called fat by people SUCKED, especially since I grew up thin, was thin in high school and only had gained the weight while in a tumultuous relationship after high school. I wasn't used to it. It was terrible.

I posted the below information in a comment on another redditor's post. He had inquired about what motivators could enable him to keep on working out. I just decided to tell a little story about how I got to where I am now and what kept me going:

My transformation came in stages

I ended up losing 36 lbs this way around the end of the summer of 2011. I was also a vegetarian (although my eating choices still weren't the most informed as I was eating a lot of frozen vegetarian dishes). I started eating meat around October and then I then started to make some really smart food choices and actually researching nutrition.

I joined Crossfit in January of 2011 at 150 lbs and in 2 months I went down to 135 lbs. Crossfit is pretty expensive but I got the knowledge on proper form

I decided to start lifting at another gym with my boyfriend and that is where I am currently at. So far I have lost another 3 lbs this month. I can now do three consecutive pullups. I like to flex my muscles in the mirror and I check myself out. I love it when my clothes get smaller but I get STRONGER. I also had a girl e-mail me telling me I was her inspiration and she has lost 30 lbs already. I started crying. I came a fucking LONG WAY from where I used to be and I am still stunned about my entire transformation and even more stunned someone is using my transformation as their motivation.

I'm sorry if there's a specific subreddit for this - if there is please direct me to it and I will post it there instead. I feel like if I put this here, not feel intimidated and start reading Starting Strength. All it takes is a goal and a desire to be fit!

You can hold it for several seconds and go back to regular plank and then switch to the other side or you can lower your hip down and raise it up again. You can make it easier by bending the bottom leg so there’s more of your body in contact with the floor.

Now we're starting to really lift weights.  The last session I had with him (Wednesday of last week) he made me grab two 15 pound weights and do shoulder presses.  I did 3 sets of 10 reps, and so was he.

Then this weekend I was doing a home routine and was doing jumping jacks.  Now realize that anything with jumping at 223 pounds is hard and painful.  I remember being able to do 10 jumping jacks and nearly having a heart attack.  Last night I did 75 jumping jacks.

When I was at the water fountain, one of the trainers that I am pretty good friends with tells me to come with him. Apparently, he didn't think I realized how wet my butt was (nor how obvious it was in those pants) and thought I should be informed.

I've had it since I was a month old. I was so sick as a child I spent a lot of my childhood in a hospital (which is one of the reasons I became a nurse) and couldn't really play in any sports except dance and cheer because I needed my inhaler. As i got older and stopped doing as many activities my asthma got worse. Recently I was hospitalized for a week with a severe asthma attack and pneumonia. I was so sick they wanted to put me an ICU but luckily I was stabilized before they could get a bed! I made the decision to change the minute I walked out of the hospital.I lurked on xxfitness the whole time I was in the hospital and found great advice. I was cleared to start working out a week after being released. The first day was awful. I could barely walk briskly on the treadmill without needing my inhaler. Well its been 3 weeks now and I can jog at 4.5mph at a 4 incline for almost a mile without needing my inhaler! I've done Zumba twice without needing it as well! Which is something I could NEVER do!  I've started lifting and when my HR goes up I enjoy it and don't need my inhaler. I changed my diet completely and I feel great!

I've been eating 1500 calories a day

If anyone is interested




EDIT: 

So! My routine goes a bit along these lines...I'll list what I started with and what I have worked up to...apologies if I get some of the terms wrong. n00b sauce. 


WEIGHTS: 

- I start with a light warmup jog of about 5 min. It's all I can really handle at this point with my knee being all bent out of shape (hawhaw)
- After jogging I do about 5 minutes of stretching
- After stretching I use the assisted bench press. I started with 10lbs on both sides and have worked up to about 25 on both sides. 10lbs x 1 rep of 15 to 25lbs x 3 reps of 15
- French press 15lbs x 1 rep of 15
- bar squats with 5lbs on either side
- Standing Dumbbell Side Bends
- Lat pull downs

Some things change from day to day. I'm always aiming to push myself a little bit harder with reps.  Also

ABS:

- Russian twists with a 6lb ball. 15 twists for each oblique
- V sits (also known as ""boat pose"") Hold the v pose for 5 seconds
- 90degree crunches.  I started with 1 rep of 15
- Planks. I started with 10 seconds x 10 reps. I've worked up to a full 1:30 plank. The MOST important part of a plank is having good form

FLOOR:

- I do donkey kicks after abs because it's a floor exercise 
- 15 donkey kicks for both legs
- 15 side kicks for both legs

I am not by any means a professional, it's important to talk to a professional so they can assess what's right for you.
Also, a bike ride, etc.  The MOST important thing I've done is watch what I eat!!! You can burn calories by eating less, if you're not doing enough cardio.  Stay in the 1200-1500 range for weight loss and don't go under!!! At LEAST 1200 a day, or your body will go into starvation mode and you won't see any progress. Your muscles need food to grow. I eat at least 40g of protein a day ((""think thin"" bars are GREAT! No sugar and no gluten!!)) and lots of fruits and veggies and nuts and stuff.  Everyone has weak moments though,  and that's okay! Everything in moderation. 

I hope some of this helps :) I had a lot of stress when I first started and wanted to quit just about every day. If you stick to it,True,,t5_2ryzy,1370902738.0,,,t3_1g28bw

Some background - up until a year or so ago, leading a pretty sedentary life anyway.  After being unexpectedly hospitalised during my second year of university from flu complications relating to my heart, I suspected it might not be normal for my heart to randomly beat at 200bpm for several minutes at a time 20 times a day, so got referred to the cardiac department of my local hospital for diagnosis and eventually an ablation.  

I had the ablation in January 2012 and all went smoothly.  I made a resolution to exercise once I'd been given the all-clear, and cooking with my (bigger than me, male) housemates in second and third year.  I managed to crash diet my way into a dress for a ball in second year through basically eating nothing for a couple of weeks, but I'm pretty certain that was all water weight.  So, along with resolving to get fit, I resolved to lose weight and get back to where I was before I came to university.  

I did this through a combination of the [NHS Couch to 5k podcasts](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k-plan.aspx) with support from /r/c25k, managing the full 5k in 45 minutes.  Since then, my PB for 5k has dropped to 33:25 (I'm aiming for sub-30 by the end of the summer break this year, hopefully before), I've moved up to the intermediate stage workouts on the NTC app, and I've lost quite a bit of weight - over a stone by the end of the summer.  

Getting back to uni I stagnated a bit - not focusing on what I ate as much as getting my assignments done, and I wanted to be able to wear a dress I wore to a wedding when I was 14 (I haven't grown height-wise since, and it's a really /really/ nice dress...).  In October, I couldn't even do the catch at the top, let alone doing the zip up.  After my January exams, I could just about zip it up if I stopped breathing.  

After a few days of a few too many Creme Eggs and delicious cookies that were on sale, and I feel a lot better about myself.  

I worked up the courage to try the dress.  

It zips all the way

Now I'm onto maintenance mode - I'm on the lower half of healthy by BMI and fit clothes I haven't been able to wear in years

I got married August 2010. I was 109 kg (240 lbs) and I couldn't stand the way I looked. I was embarassed on my wedding day actually. I decided that I was going to change and get things back in control

I started jogging and walking more

By December 2010 I was down to 100 kg. Then a long trip to the US sent me back 4kg. By May 2011 I was down to 97kg or so. In September 2011 I moved to Sweden and proceeded to lose 5kg through the rest of the year. In February 2012 I finally dipped right under 90kg or so during a skiing trip to Austria. That summer (2012) I reached 84kg through eating less, and swimming some. In September 2012 I started a new job that required commuting and by the new year of 2013 I was back at almost 92kg. I moved to be closer to my job because I didn't want to sit on a train 3 hours everyday and get fat again. In February I signed up for the BTFC here on reddit and got real. I joined my swim team and started exercising heavily and eating better. The weight loss has gone excruciatingly slow and last month I found out that my thyroid wasn't functioning 100% but its not terrible. 

Right now Im sitting around 84.5kg. I've lost 25kg since I got married a little less than 3 years ago. It hasn't been easy but wow I feel great. I swim 4-6 times a week

For those out there that feel like giving up because it's slow going or because they've slipped a few times: Don't. Everyone slips. Everyone has days where the world is falling apart and nothing feels better than a bowl of brownie mix. Focus on how good exercise makes you feel and how good you feel when you eat right and try to stick with it. Be as consistent as possible but forgive yourself when it goes wrong.

First, amazing women, and every single one of you has the power to achieve your goals, whatever they are.  Whatever the fuck they are.  

That said, women who want all of the work done for them and are unwilling to put any extra effort forth themselves.  I'm seeing posts by women who want to improve their diet but won't eat any healthful foods because they ""don't like them"".  I'm seeing posts completely ignoring the FAQ, although I admittedly can't blame those folks TOO much since it isn't posted particularly prominently on this subreddit.

This shit has to stop.

Making the choice to get in shape, and become more active is a fantastic thing, but it does not stop there.  You have to take responsibility for it.  You have to be willing to put forth effort.  You cannot expect the rest of the world to award you a gold star and a complimentary personalized diet and workout program.  You need to do some of the work yourself.  You cannot make excuses as to why you are unwilling to do some or all of it.  You do not get a pass for being ""scared"" to go to the gym.  You do not get a pass for not liking healthy food.  If you want to make that lifestyle change badly enough, you will either ovary up and deal with your fear or you will find a different way to make the change.  If you don't want it badly enough, then you won't do it.  And that's fine, if that's what you want.  But if that's what you want, then you do not get a pass to complain about the results you did not get with the work you did not do.

-  The fitness center is basically part of the hotel spa

- It's mostly empty after work since the hotel guests that exercise seem to prefer working out early morning and afternoon.  

- There's good cardio equipment, and a sauna.  I usually have the dumbbell rack to myself.

- There's a great shower with free soap, razor, and even lend you a hairdryer.

- There's no contract or initiation fee.  I paid for 6 months up front.

- There's lemon-infused water and free fruit.  Faaaancy!

The hardest part about fitness is that I honestly feel like two different people in my goals and wants.

On good days, turn down cheese and other fatty yet delicious foods, happily eat vegetables, have light meals, eat overall more lean.  I feel hunger, and I'm glad because I know that means I haven't stuffed myself, and that everything I've eaten has been put to good use.  And it feels great and is so effortless, I let it go and focus on the future.

On bad days, fried, sweet, and cheese-covered food.  I eat fast food, with a large sweet tea or coke.  I crave to eat, even after knowingly (gleefully!) eating 1,200 calories in one meal, like: ""I want to lose weight, I eat a burrito.  I eat three if I want.  I feel full

I say I get hungry quickly on bad days, ""Good, I haven't over-eaten, this is the way my body is supposed to feel sometimes, I should eat to fix it, but this is a good sign.""  Sometimes, on good day hungers, to see how in control of my body I am.  I like to eat less, like it's pushing my limit, it's ecstasy.  Every flavor feels so decadent

Of course, unhealthy, fattening meal I feel endless amounts of guilt.  I've laid in bed, stressed, wiggling my toes at a cuththroat pace just to squeeze out even two more calories burned that day, tensing my tummy and legs hoping at least I'm helping tone something.  My biggest enemy is myself and she is winning.

I'm going to sound like a kid, and now I just want food? I think I really, really, struggle with moderation.  I don't think ""Just this once"" exists to me, as I'll eat a bad meal ""just this once"" and then, I look back and every day that week I ate an ""Exception meal"" for a special occasion and my good days are shrinking, right under my nose.  On good days I look at pictures of skinny-fit girls, ""I'm on my way to that!"" On bad days I look at those pictures

The following commences on my facebook:

----------------------------

Guy: more reps and less weight. don't get into the numbers game. that's for muscleheads. you want lean muscle with definition. lots of variation, full extensions. make you look like a ripped goddess. and the mass will be functional outside the gym. all that grunting and groaning is silly. you should be sweating, not grunting. circuit training is good and fast, but using free weights in between each station really mixes it up. p90x type workouts aren't hype. it's just the basics of using tons of muscles instead of isolating your biceps on a bench press. &lt;gag&gt;

Me: Actually, ""variation"" and ""mixing it up"" are nice words for ""no clear goal or linear progression,"" p90x doesn't build strength and bench press is actually a compound barbell movement that does a hell of a lot more than work your biceps, mostly because bench press is a pushing exercise and has absolutely nothing to *do* with biceps, which are used for pulling.

**My Story**

I decided in the end of July to take my fitness more seriously. My boyfriend at the time was really active, I had completed Couch to 5K, so I knew I had the willpower to become more active. I decided to challenge myself to see if I could: (1) become more active/healthy/fit and (2) lose weight and meet a goal.

For cardio, to friends' houses (5-7 miles rountrip). It's a great workout, and it's made my quads super strong and hard.

In the beginning

I also take long walks on the weekend

I also dieted. I used the MyFitnessPal app to track my calories. At first it was really tedious to track everything I consumed, but my portions were way too big. 

I set a goal of 1 lb loss per week, I realized that my stomach gets full a lot quicker now. I am accustomed to smaller, healthier portions.

I am happy with my new body

Future goals? I'd like to sign up for a 5K run soonish and do AIDS Life Cycle in 2014.

I have been attending my university's gym for the four years I've been here. For the first three years

For the past few months

I have noticed however, so I haven't had any problems then. During this time of the day I sometimes see one or two other girls, which is encouraging. For the last few weeks, every time I go to the weight room in the afternoon or night, someone in a fraternity shirt has to comment. I have only ever seen one other girl in the weight room at night, and she is a sexy she-hulk that guys are obviously very intimidated by. (I sort of secretly wish she was my BFF. I could be her side kick, and we could fight misogyny everywhere!) 

The first time, but everyone has to start somewhere, not to mention I had never bench pressed anything a week earlier. Some guy comes up and says ""Shouldn't you be in the dumbbell section?"" Maybe its because I was having a shitty day, or really just because I'm not as much as a lady as I think I am, but I told him to fuck off.

About a week later, so maybe he really thought I wasn't capable of finishing the rep, and was just trying to be nice. But still, I feel like if I had been a dude squatting, he wouldn't have ""helped"" me. I told him I was fine and started my set again.

I've seen a couple people just starting out on New Rules of Lifting for Women

I'm 23, and I started NROLW after losing 30 pounds in 4 months of pure cardio/caloric restriction. At the end of losing all that weight, I just felt weak- certainly better than I did at my start weight of 170, but I wasn't the fit person full of energy that I had imaged when I set out to lose the weight. Cue lifting!

Within a week of starting to lift heavy things, and lifting honestly just made me feel like a badass!

My progress on the lifts of the program was...

* Squats: 18lb body bar -&gt; 145lbs
* Deadlifts: Empty bar -&gt; 145lbs
* Lat pull downs: 40lbs -&gt; 80lbs
* Seated rows: 30lbs -&gt; 80lbs
* Dumbbell overhead presses: 25lbs (12.5 in each hand) -&gt; 50 lbs (25 each)
* Push-Ups: 10 standard -&gt; 15 T push-ups with 10lb weights (At the top of the push-up
* Lunges: 30lbs -&gt; 50lbs (25lb dumbbell in each hand)
* Step ups: 30lbs (low step) -&gt; 50lbs (high step

Andddd the good part: [Pictures! NSFW](http://imgur.com/a/7O82S)

The first picture is at 170lbs before I started losing weight. The second picture is after I had lost 30lbs through cardio/calorie counting. The third picture is me currently, I can promise you that they are SO much more firm and muscular.

The last few pictures are bonus pictures- I don't have any to compare with from before

Nutrition has been hard for me- after spending so long cutting down to a silly amount of calories (1200-1500 a day, and instead I just try to be very mindful of my body's needs. I eat a lot of fruit and veggies, but I'm not shy around the peanut butter or almonds or greek yogurt either! I try to get most of my protein through lean meats, but I do have a protein shake on lifting days because I find it really helps my recovery. Every week, I buy one thing at the grocery store that isn't ""ideal"" and I enjoy every bite of it- this week it's a box of girl scout cookies! I also generally have a ""cheat"" meal over the weekend. This keeps me sane.

So that's my progress so far! I plan to keep on lifting because I like what it's doing for my body :) Thank you so much for your support ladies,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,t3_1czich

**A.** Mods remove all threads that are purely based on pictures (i.e. ""Wow look how far my [insert body part] has come along!"") and leave a comment instructing OP to post in the weekly thread instead.

**B.**  We disable link/image posts altogether. Only text-based posts will be allowed, etc.). Posts which are still just ""Check out my [insert body part]"" would be removed and directed to the weekly thread.

**C.** We leave things as they are.

It's also been brought up that the name of the Sunday pic thread (""Sunderwear Day"") may not be the best

To me, fit or for just setting foot in the gym.

I've experienced this twice in 24 hours and it has really riled me!

Last night I went to the gym and indulged in a really intense core and abs workout. I was finishing up with 30 minutes of cardio and this amazing lady walked in. I'm not sure if she was a competitive bodybuilder, one of them even going as far as saying ""she looks disgusting, fucking lesbian."" I was in absolute shock! In my eyes, she didn't look disgusting at all and her sexuality has nothing to do with it! I gave them a filthy look, but was too speechless (and breathless) to voice my utter frustration at what they had said. I should've stuck up for her and given them a piece of my mind, but I didn't, because I was a coward. I feel terrible about not saying anything

So I left the gym, but these ignorant people need to realise they can't get away with that kind of stuff, whether the person you're talking about can hear it or not.

This morning, wrestling and bodybuilding. I'd sent him a message asking him about his training and in only his second message to me, he wrote the words: ""I actually find it really unattractive that you know so much about lifting."" Wow. Just wow. Now I know muscular/fit women aren't to everyones tastes, but YOU requested my friendship and now you're being a dick because I have an interest in something that YOU don't consider appropriate for a woman to know about? I simply replied with ""If a woman being knowledgable about weightlifting intimidates you then you must live a very sad and shallow existence."" Then I blocked and deleted him.

This happened before I went to work and it made me so annoyed! This, ignorant, judgemental and down-right offensive about women who are fit or trying to get fit. 

I let myself seethe for a while and then I decided to do something positive instead. I've promised myself that the next time I'm in the gym and the lady is there, whether it is to their liking or not.

I see myself as an intermediate lifter. I've been lifting long enough and heavy enough that I don't feel like a beginner any more, and frequency. But I still haven't been lifting very long (only about 6 months), and my numbers are decent but not exceptional.

So I hit a big milestone yesterday. I deadlifted 5x100kg. I first lifted 100kg about four weeks ago - one very slow rep that left me feeling exhilarated. I literally danced around the gym. I first pulled three reps three weeks ago, it felt so good.](http://imgur.com/xqIBE1K)

So that's my big achievement for the week. My next deadlift goal is to hit 120kg (just 1 rep to start with). 120kg will be 1.5x my body weight. :)

**EDIT: As requested

For context

I started lifting in February with a personal trainer, seriously). I couldn't do a single body weight squat when he first tested me in February! Seriously underdeveloped glutes. He moved me off the machines and onto free weights as soon as he felt I had enough strength to learn movements without injuring myself.

I started out with two personal training sessions each week

Things have changed a bit since then!

I'm currently training 5-6 days a week. I try for 6, and aim for four more on my own.

When I work with him, the week before that was back, and before that was shoulders. That cardio is pretty much the only cardio I do at the moment - and I do it mostly because a little bit of cardio is good for my lifting. But only a little bit. ;)

My four solo sessions are based on an upper/lower split, dumbbell shoulder presses, bench pull, and supersets of cable hammer curls and overhead tricep extensions. The lower routine is basically squat day - back squats, leg press, front squats, leg curls, but I love it. Rep ranges vary from 4-10 depending on the exercise - I aim for 4 rep work sets on bench, with 2-3 minute rests. Everything else is 10

My trainer works in six week increments, shoulder, leg. For each six week program, we set goals, and mine are purely strength based.

Right now (as of this week) a typical leg day would end up with work sets that look like this:

* Back squats: 2x4 at 75kg
* Leg press: 3x6 at 240kg (that is not a typo! I own that machine.)
* Front squats: 3x10 at 40kg
* Leg curls: 3x10 at 40kg
* Goblet squats: 3x10 at 32kg (kettlebell

A typical upper body day would end up with work sets that look a bit like this:

* Bench: 2x4 at 40kg
* Deadlifts: 2x4 at 100kg
* Dumbbell shoulder press: 3x10 at 10kg (each hand
* Bench pull: 3x10 at 20kg
* Hammer curls/OH tricep extensions SS 3x10 at 12.5kg

I'm currently bulking - eating pretty much whatever I like, the more muscle I build, and I'm still quietly losing body fat. I'm seeing gradually increasing vascularity and some more prominent bones, though the scales are creeping up. I have my body fat measured with calipers every 6 weeks, and I have been losing about 1% fat each time. Interesting to see if that continues, but I'm starting a cut on October 1 so that will change the game again.",,,bear-lifting,

Two weeks ago I was at work minding my own business when suddenly I felt a cramping pain in my guts. Most people would assume this was food poisoning but I knew that this was the feeling of a blocked small intestine. This had happened to me once before...it took over 24 hours of cramping pain and being diagnosed wrongly with appendicitis and gallstones before someone figured out what was up - scar tissue from an operation to remove ovarian cancer tumours from 2 years ago had gotten all up in my business and was strangling my guts. Nothing got through, drink or poop for the 2 weeks it took in hospital to get sorted out. But back in May it did sort itself out and I went on my merry way. Now I had it again.


After a week in hospital nothing was changing in the slightest. The non-surgical route wasn't going to work this time and now a second operation to fix me was my only hope. So I went back under the knife.  


[This photo album shows my scar at different times [NSFW]](http://imgur.com/a/fOJra). I wasn't in shape at all before I got the first scar. You can see in the second picture in this album I posted. I was bloated and stretch marked


It took 11 days to recover from the first operation enough to leave hospital. I was only unable to eat from the date of surgery until about 4 days later when my digestive system kicked back in again. I took 4 days to stand up without help from physio


After that first surgery I decided to get fit. I started with pilates and swimming and then did the Couch to 5k. I switched to astanga yoga and after discovering places like /r/fitness and this subreddit


As a result


I lost 13lb during the past 2 weeks bringing my total weight loss in 2 years down to around 45lb. This is not good weight loss! I inevitably lost muscle during this time because I was starving but at least the extra muscle I had on me means that I am now a much smaller 138lb person than I was the last time I was this weight (when I was 14!). Despite the fact my belly is swollen right now from the surgery.


I am 100% determined to get my strength back as soon as possible, I'm not doing too bad! The experience I've had is exactly why fitness is so important, it gives your body the ability to put up a good fight and I know that it will always be a part of my life from now on.


Also when I can swim again nothing is going to stop me from breaking out the bikini

I'm not new to fitness

Joined a gym about 8 weeks ago and got a personal trainer 4 weeks ago.  My personal trainer is great, and always makes me feel like there is room for improvement.  One of his main points is that you need to get out of your comfort zone because the action starts outside of it.  This has been going through my mind for a couple of weeks now, and when I'm working out with him I'm definitely pushed out of my comfort zone (or shoved however you want to look at it), but when I work out alone I seem to just step slightly out of my comfort zone.  Today I definitely jumped out of my comfort zone.

So my city is separated by a large hill.  I'd say on an average treadmill it's about a 12 - 15 percent incline.  I've been climbing this beast of a hill for 3 years but always walked up it.  Today I had my personal trainer's voice in my head that said ""do you want results or do you want results quickly?""  So for parts of that hill (takes me about 15 - 20 minutes to walk it) I ran.  I actually RAN.  Fat, face red and sweaty, felt like I was going to puke after each burst of energy RAN up that hill!  Then I came back to my office and there's a set of stairs that run up the side of a hill that I normally climb 10 times.  Every odd climb I ran up those stairs.  

I'm a bit proud of myself today.  I don't normally run in public because I hate for people to see all my fat rolling around like a bowl full of jelly

Anyways, when the last time I had an assessment was, what my goals are (I'm obviously overweight), how I decided to do what I was doing, if I worked with a trainer. He asks to see my workout plan and I show him what I had been doing. And then he says that it is too advanced. I should be doing dumbbells and machines for 3 - 4 months before I do barbells. That the 45lb bar was too heavy for me to lift and the movements I had planned were too advanced. He pointed out which machines I should be doing. Anyways, he made me feel like shit, but he ended off with a ""let me know if you need any help!"". So after this I moved on to do my Press

I end up alternating jogging and walking for 20 minutes. I didn't want to push too hard, then just shoulder presses for 6 minutes, then hold the weight above my head for 6 minutes. All while walking at a 12.0 incline at 2 mph. He says to do two sets of that and then disappears.

Then he takes me to the elliptical. Now, but every time I try, my quads are on fire after about a minute. It feels like I'm running full speed up a flight of stairs. I tell him this. He tells me that it's a cardio exercise, my legs shouldn't be burning that much. I ask him to teach me how to use it properly. He says that there is no way to use it improperly. I stop after a minute because my legs are shaking.

He takes me back to the treadmill, that it will tighten up my skin so it doesn't sag when I lose weight.

1367390652.0,1dgvm7,Progress pics: 8 months lifting transformation [F/29/5’5”],SelfPotat0,59,3,18,"I am turning 30 next week

**Looooong post. TL;DR – scroll down for photo links

Compared to other progress posts here and in /r/fitness, but for me lifting has been life-changing.

Lifting has given me a huge confidence boost that translates into all aspects of life. I wish I had started at least 10 years ago. I’m not really a shy person, I was insecure and lonely, and couldn’t bear to spend time alone. I came to grips with a lot of these issues in my mid-20s, but lifting weights has been really pivotal for helping me feel like “hey, I’m awesome, I can kick some ass!”

Entering the weight room alone the first time was a bit intimidating, autonomous, and capable overall. Recently, my boyfriend and I helped a friend move, including an assembled [5-shelf IKEA Expedit bookcase] (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60208648/), up and down a few stairs and on and off a truck! My new-found strength has also opened up a new world of possibilities in terms of things to do for fun – most recently, indoor rock-climbing and bouldering!

**One of my goals with this post is to demonstrate to other women who are thinking of starting to lift that you don’t have to do things perfectly to see positive changes.** I did not follow Starting Strength properly. I read the book (twice) and studied form, and /r/weightroom, etc. daily. But, I started the major lifts at different times because I was too chicken ([see my lifting graph](http://imgur.com/AILJaFL)). Doesn’t matter – I still did *something*, and I still made progress. I truly enjoy lifting, and I don’t have motivational issues with getting to the gym 3x/week (whereas spending ½ hour on the elliptical always felt like a chore for me). However, life happens, other obligations get in the way. I’ve had setbacks and bumps in the road, not in pain and falling apart.

* Phase 1: I was your typical skinny-fat in my teens and early 20s – hovering ~123-128 lbs, but tight in the waist. I was a complete dunce in PE in high school. After college (thanks to a steady income), I dabbled in yoga, surfing, and horseback-riding, but could never stick with jogging or a gym program. My diet was nearly-vegetarian (except the vegetables part): primarily carbs (pasta or pizza nearly every day), tofu, and dairy.

* Phase 2: Put on pounds in my late 20s, stopped exercising (except commuting by bike 5 miles roundtrip, 5x/week), and ate ramen daily at 2AM. Stopped weighing myself, guessing ~135 lbs - not particularly heavy for my 5’5” frame (still squeezing into US size 4-6, ~35.5/ 30.5/37.5”), but because I carry weight pretty much only in my midsection instead of all over, but I was too ashamed to document myself in underwear or swimwear during this time

* Phase 3: Starting in March 2012, bike commuting) to lose weight. Combined with getting really sick (GI issue, not an advisable weight-loss strategy!), I got down to 119 lbs by June-July. But, I was still dissatisfied with my appearance – I had skinny arms and legs, but even with my waist the smallest it had ever been, I had no butt or boobs

* Phase 4: Late Aug 2012, along with unexpected improvements in other areas: well-defined and firm legs, arms, and back; plus, pecs gave me some boobage back. (Also, started frequenting /r/aBraThatFits recently – having a well-fitting bra has also been transformative!) I did not experience the dramatic waistline-whittling from lifting that many other girls do, but I think that’s just my body type. I still carry fat on my belly, still US size 4 (33/27/36”)

**Lifting details:**
In late Aug, and assisted chin-ups (finally got my first real chin-up in late Jan). I had done bench a little bit in high school, so I was comfortable starting with it, but I didn’t have a spotter so for a couple months I quit and did push-ups instead (went from knee and incline-pushups to 15+ real ones!). I ended up teaching a female friend to lift, and also joined my boyfriend’s gym, so I have spotters now. I didn’t start deadlift or OHP right away, which I regret. For DL, I LOVE deadlifting so much, and have made very little progress thus far. I also have not yet done powercleans (the shame!). I made strength gains until late March

My PRs (lbs):

* Low-bar squat (3 x 5): Aug = 60^1 --&gt; 135 

* Bench (3 x 5): Nov = 65 --&gt; 82.5 (3 x 3 = 85)

* OHP (3 x 5): Dec = 45 --&gt; 55

* DL (conventional

* DL (sumo

(^1 My first time squatting

I also do a 4-min Tabata sprint on the elliptical 1-2x/week after lifting. Still riding horses 1x/week and bike commuting, taking an aerial silks class, indoor rock-climbing and bouldering (which I think I’ll keep doing), and hiking more.

**About my diet:**
I’m not very good in this area, but I still struggle to eat enough vegetables. My major accomplishment has been no longer relying so heavily on carbs like pasta and pizza, and not buying things like chips, crackers, or cookies. Also, gave up alcohol – now drinking plain water, unsweetened coconut water, including being ok with leaving food on my plate if I’m not enjoying it. 

Aiming for ~110 g protein daily. Basic routine: only black coffee until 11AM; jumbo hard-boiled egg; Gallo lite salami; ½ fuji apple with raw chunky almond butter (Trader Joe’s); ½ fuji apple with Knudsen cottage cheese (Costco); weight watchers smoked mozzarella string cheese; sometimes raw almonds &amp; walnuts, raisins, sliced almonds; or Brussels sprouts with bacon and shallots; some kind of meat, e.g. turkey sausage patty with shredded cheese and jumbo fried egg; lean ground beef, mushrooms, pasta sauce, quinoa; Costco rotisserrie chicken w/hot sauce; baked wild salmon

Lifting days: More carbs, balsamic vinegar, goat cheese, and sprinkle of basil. Protein shake! Add in this order to Magic Bullet: frozen berries (Costco 3-berries), 2% milk (or almond milk + greek yogurt, depending on what I have around), ground flax, unsweetened coconut flakes

**Acknowledgement:** I am extremely lucky to have a super-supportive boyfriend. A lifting-buddy gave him Starting Strength a few years ago. He never pushed me to try lifting, but got sick of the crowds, so I joined his gym too and we lift together regularly. He’s always been really active, so sometimes I’m amazed that he put up with my years of couch-potato laziness. In addition to lifting, we do more active things together now, and sharing more interests has only benefited our relationship. He’s been nothing but supportive and encouraging through the years, regardless of my physical and psychological ups and downs.

Here's to 30 being the best year yet!

But after a few weeks, you needed to keep going. And even if you resembled the media prescribed ideal body, there was always an area you had to improve on. I've seen so many posts, especially ones surrounding female progress, that put down the OP because she simply wasn't their ideal shape. And if that individual said they were happy with their body now, it wasn't uncommon to see a post saying they were just being lazy. Obviously I'm generalizing here, and not all of it is like that

It wasn't necessarily the comments beneath the posts

Probably the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that they proclaim not to obsess over numbers. They say it's about getting healthy, they get oggled and blatantly harassed. Comments like ""oohh such good progress, and your tits are good too"". Awesome, thanks for complimenting a part of my body that probably has NOTHING to do with my fitness progress.

I'm not saying that bettering yourself throughout your life isn't healthy. But this constant attempt at doing more, time to go live my life"". I certainly don't want to put down people who treat fitness as their hobby. I think that's an entirely different scenario. But I feel like people like myself, who just want to be healthy and active, get pushed to the side a lot in these subreddits. Or even worse, put down. We're just the lazy population bringing down humanity.

So I quit. I don't quit fitness, it isn't my thing. I enjoy food too much, I enjoy drinking with my friends and I love just living my life.

I have been cutting and making some serious efforts to eat better as of late. I know for me a big part of why I ended up in a fitness slump is because I love eating bad food... consuming huge amounts of sweets at a time and craving sweet food almost every day.

So while it was possible to cut this stuff out, cheap, easy snacking.

I have made three batches so far and we go through about 1 batch/week. I've tweaked the recipe each time and this is the best I've been able to come up with. These are mega tasty

Made with my ingredients
    * **200 calories**
    * **22g Carbs**
    * **9g Fat**
    * **11g Protein**
    * **2g Fiber**
    * **8g Sugar**

Ingredients:
    * 1 Tablespoon Honey
    * 1 Cup peanut butter
    * 2/3 Cup milk
    * 1 1/2 cups protein powder (4 scoops with my particular protein. I use the Optimum Nutrition double chocolate kind)
    * 2 cups old fashioned oats
    * 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (optional

1.) In a saucepan over low heat melt honey
2.) Remove from heat
3.) Add oats and stir until combined.
4.) In a 9x13 pan
5.) put bars in fridge to harden/set. Only needs an hour or two but longer is fine. Cut into 16 equal pieces and nom nom!

Other tips: I trace the outline for cutting up the bars w/ the tip of the spatula before putting them in the fridge. This makes it easier to cut them up, but if I take one out to put in the gym bag I don't worry about it.

1326606265.0,ohp0t,How I was wrong about my bra size and body proportions after weight loss,boomerzoomer,66,9,33,"Let's talk about boobs (again).

After I lost excess weight

I've always been flat-chested

Flash forward to today

But bra fitting utterly perplexes me.  Online calculators kept giving me different sizes (36A, and ""no bra is needed"". Sigh).  I couldn't decipher how the hell bra companies categorize their titties.

Then, I went and tried some things on.

Long story short

I admit to being a bit dismissive of the XX FAQ's point that weight loss usually doesn't affect the boobage, stupid genetics.  I lost a cup size!  Oh well.

Nope, I'm still in disbelief, but sure enough I can stretch all of my current bra bands about 4+ inches away from my body.  Before this, I actually thought I had a monstrously large ribcage!

All along

Note:  Not that having different body proportions would be bad or unattractive.  My point is that I was definitely estimating my size wrong and mentally skewing my body proportions in my head toward something that didn't make sense or reflect reality.  I'm wondering if other gals on here have done the same.  In my experience

For the past 3 years, which is 10 lbs up from where I started 3 years ago. That whole time, I've tried to use calorie counting as my primary means of fat loss, which did work well when I was able to stick to it.

Unfortunately, and the more obsessive and miserable about food I got. I would have periods of several weeks where I would stick to my goal more or less, but I would feel hungry and restless and constantly focusing on when my next meal would be and wondering whether I would be satisfied with it and just wishing I could eat a big bowl of ice cream or potato chips. Eventually, my willpower would break and I would do just that, binge on junk food and then hate myself after. And then the cycle would repeat. By trying to control myself I ended up feeling like I had NO control whatsoever.

I am just so sick of living that way. It's no way to live!

Earlier in May I went on a vacation and decided to just completely ditch the diet. No calorie counting, because really, it didn't matter in the grand scheme of things; I just wanted to enjoy the vacation that I had worked for. I knew I would probably gain weight, and I did, about 5 lbs. But I felt so free without the constant background chatter going in my head about how I was hungry and what should I eat and can I eat this, no it has too many calories etc. etc.

The thing is

I also want to start weight lifting again (I tried briefly last summer, but to do that I'll have to start tracking all of my food again (which is hardly different from calorie counting).

I guess I just want to know, I just want to stop.

I started last summer at 185, even though I know it would probably be the easiest way to drop the weight.

I'm stuck on Week 3 of Zombies, so I didn't do the free form runs, and walked them instead. I don't know if I should keep repeating it 'til it's easier or move on. The next drill is a 5 min run. I can barely do 1.

I don't really know what I'm doing with weight training. I made a workout buddy in the gym and I'm going to take notes. But I'm pretty weak. I can only deadlift about 50 lbs and I can't curl 10. And sometimes

I'm pretty inflexible. I started doing [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1iO31O41vk) power yoga video

I know I have to keep going and that it will get better. I've been eating less than before. I don't count so don't really know by how much, so I was on track with that. I lost 9 lbs, so I'm about 13 lbs away from my goal. 

But oh God. It gets discouraging, no less). How I can't get into position and I feel like an old man trying to stretch.

At what point did you stop sucking? I mean those fellow Slow Pokes who used to never exercise. My girlfriend has done sports since she was a little girl so it's hard to compare myself to her, don't get me wrong. But shit. It's confusing and it's hard and I feel really weak, both physically and mentally. Does it get easier? I don't know how I'm going to get swole as fuck. It seems like such a far off goal, and I'm scared I'll never get there.

Some backstory: About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and couldn't do anything without having to take a nap. I slept almost 24/7. When I got sick my weight plummeted and I was the most out of shape I've ever been. I lost what little muscle I had before. During this whole period my resting heart rate was over 100bpm. (May have partially been caused by some medication I was on)

Since then I have slowly recovered from the extreme fatigue. In the past 4 years I have gone from not being about to walk up the stairs without laying down to enjoying exercise! Now I'm on a mission to become stronger and improve my health even more. I just started exercising about 3 weeks ago. It began with really low intensity stuff like going on nightly walks. Then I stepped it up to cardio at the gym and even running a little! I can honestly say that even 2 years ago I could never picture myself doing what I have done the past month.

VICTORY: Today I took my pulse and it was 70bpm! Oh my gosh! I couldn't believe it so I kept re-doing it

So here is where I might sound a tad bitchy.  My problem comes with what the author describes as ""Problem #2.""  Damn right

I lift weights 4 times a week and do kickboxing at least two additional days.  I eat clean probably 75% of the time (1800 cals a day) and not once have I been tempted to eat rock and dirt juice to drop a few lbs.  It's about being healthy and strong first and foremost.

January 2010 (19) : 180 and never measured. size 14 jeans. 

Now (21) : 130. 33 inch bust (36 leaning over as I saw on /r/bestof). 28 inch waist. (at the thinnest part right?) 39 inch hips. 

I went down to 150 by an extreme reduction in stress. I was small though weak and not toned

My boyfriend is a roofer and very fit. He always thought I looked good but my hips and bum are quite big. It doesn't look good either - all stretch marks and cellulite. (some girls look very hot with my measurements or bigger. Just not me.) I've tried to go to the gym but I get fatigued easily and go home. He also encourages me to eat more of a variety than Ramen and spaghetti. Salad is so good. I never had it until a month ago. I just have cucumbers

My dad's new wife has a treadmill and they both work all day. I have access to it and a completely empty house (save my sister in the summer) and shower so I do that sometimes. I bought Brazil Butt Lift by Beachbody (the guys who make Insanity) and it is amaaazing. I am falling out of the size sixes (American Eagle for comparison) I bought at a yardsale 18 days ago. I've drank 30 oz of soda a day and eaten fast food 3-4 times and I have lost four inches total off my body in TWO WEEKS. Sorry for advertising but I am very very pleased with the product. 

I see many of you have lost a lot and that is awesome! If you guys upvote this and get enough replies (50 maybe?) I can chart it and we can save it. It can be discouraging to feel like you don't look good enough even after working hard - it's good to break it down and see we are all the same.

**Early life:**
I was always a skinny child. Sometime during middle school, my weight spiked upwards for reasons I've never really figured out, but it got to the point where I was extremely uncomfortable ever wearing a bathing suit in public. And then for more reasons unknown (though it may have to do with joining dance team), I dropped a ton of weight in my senior year of high school. It stayed that way for the entire summer after high school, even though I wasn't exercising and I was eating a lot.

**Early college:**
I continued to eat a lot and not exercise in my  first semester of college. I rapidly gained weight, I tried once more to diet. I thought I did okay (and I took some Zumba/spin/aerobics classes), but it didn't result in any weight loss. 

**The turning point and onward:**
January 2012 came, veggies, and nuts. I was vegetarian before this, but I started eating seafood to add something more to what I ate. I also began the Couch to 5K program. I noticed myself losing weight. When C25K ended, I briefly tried the 10K version, but I'm not a runner and I hated it. 

I then decided that I needed something else that had structure and a solid endpoint, and I didn't want to bother my roommate, so I started doing it less and never completed the second month. I'd use the gym a lot for cardio. My eating habits still continued. We're at about June 2012 at this point.

So I met a guy in June, and I gained some weight. I kept working out though, so it wasn't a horrible gain. At the end of the summer, he introduced me to lifting, and I learned a few basic exercises. During the fall of 2012, I started to mix them in with some cardio. My diet for fall 2012 varied considerably. I'd have healthy weeks followed by unhealthy followed by healthy, and so on. 

I lived with this guy over winter break (Dec 2012 - Jan 2013), and I'm eating around maintenance and lifting most days of the week. I feel excellent about my body. I think I'm going to do one more bulk phase during the winter and then cut with a few months left before summer.

But never having an actual goal or competition to work towards, I would stray from any lame attempt at dieting and go right back to where I was. I was getting depressed about it. I stopped wearing certain clothes because I was getting self-conscious about the fat on my body. I almost ate *more* junk food as I got more depressed. I don’t really know *why* I did that, I just…did.

It was my boyfriend who finally challenged me to take control and do something about it. My boyfriend competes in bodybuilding competitions for fun

I started out with 30minute cardio sessions added to my daily workouts, 3x a week. It wasn’t much, but I didn’t want add too much cardio at once, and hate it more than I already did. I always did the cardio *after* I lifted weights. The cardio would help work out lactic acid to help prevent soreness the next day
My cardio sessions were just me walking on the treadmill at 3mph at an incline of 10% to 14%. After a week or two of this, or finish the workout first, kept me going. The HIIT-like class really jump started my weight-loss journey. 

I began attending this Boot camp class 3x a week

**After: Diet** *Disclaimer: I want to stress how *not* hungry I was. I had cravings

*Things I ate a lot of:* chicken breast, apples, peas, eggs, green beans, Frank’s Red Hot Sauce, mushrooms, and coffee (no mochas or caramel macchiatos!! Black coffee with a little bit of skim milk). (If you don’t like peas

*Things I ate occasionally:* skinny cow ice cream bars (these really helped when I was craving chocolate), avocados, apple sauce, brown rice, almonds, and walnuts.

*Things I cut out:* pasta, soda, juice (too much sugar…), beer (this killed me), getting drunk off of hard alcohol, butter, and fast food.

**A typical day:**

* Breakfast: 1 egg + 2 egg whites scrambled + salt and pepper + frank’s hot sauce

* Lunch: 1 cup of greek yogurt + 6 chopped walnuts + half an apple diced + 1 banana; optional: 1 tablespoon of applesauce to sweeten it up.

* Snack!: 1 apple sliced up with this delicious dip I made; peanut butter

*Insert 1.5 hours of weight training and then 1 hour of cardio/Boot camp here*

* Dinner: One Sliced Chicken Breast cooked in a pan + diced onions + Frank’s Sauce + sliced mushrooms and a side of peas (2 cups of peas)

* Optional Dessert: **ONE** Skinny Cow ice cream bar or ice cream sandwich

**My Workout Schedule**

Monday: Squats and legs + Boot Camp

Tuesday: Bench + Back and upper body + Cardio 

Wednesday: Deadlifts and legs + Boot Camp + Cardio

Thursday: OHP + Back and upper body + Cardio

Friday: Squats and legs + Boot Camp

**My Body/Emotional Health**

I didn’t see any results in my appearance until I had lost 15 pounds and had been dieting and doing *stupid* cardio for a month and a half. Other people saw it and complimented my weight loss and told me how great I was looking. I would half-heartedly take their compliments

I think I broke down crying to my boyfriend three times. I cried about how miserable I felt doing so much cardio, I couldn’t win. I could either, break the diet and cardio and go back to being miserable about being fat…or I could keep being miserable about dieting and the cardio. But my boyfriend kept supporting me, and pushing me to keep to it. He was incredibly supportive and I don’t know what I would have done if he wasn’t there dragging me along kicking and screaming. But once I woke up one day, and saw how flat my stomach was…everything clicked. It all became worth it. I wore a tight mini skirt and sequin tank top (because we all know how those damn sequins show off every roll or stomach pooch) and I felt beautiful. I was happy.

The cravings sucked for the first month. I wanted pizza, cheese, and everything else you can imagine. But I eventually felt okay with not having those things. In fact when I had a slice of pizza with some friends, I had the worst stomach cramps afterwards. I felt gross. It tasted delicious, but man…I felt so horrible after eating it.

Now that my boyfriend is done with his competition

*Unexpected benefits:* I actually ended up saving a lot of money on groceries by eating this way. I ate everything I cooked up and almost never threw food out because it spoiled.

Anyway

I'm very new to tampons - 20 years old and I've only used them once so far (long story, that I've only just started to overcome). So, if this is a dumb question, please bear with me.

Can one do exercises such as squats and lunges with a tampon in? I've noticed that when I, the tampon kind of moves a bit, assumedly because of the bearing down. (Is that even supposed to happen?) I'm worried that when I'm lifting heavy, especially with squats, it's going to become dislodged and kind of...move down, is the best way I can put it, to a point where I can feel that it's not in the right place. I really don't want to be interrupting my workout and running to the bathroom in between sets to fix it...

I know that all sorts of female athletes use tampons

A year ago

What I did:

* no drastic dietary changes (I wasn't doing things like drinking soda or eating fast food all the time anyway). Mostly just trying to be a bit more conscious about what/how much I was eating
* July 10-Nov 10 -- couch to 5k running program. It took me at least 3 weeks to even get to week 1 of the program -- when I started
* Nov 10 -- the track that I was using closes at dusk
* Feb 11 -- started lifting dumbbells
* June 11 -- started lifting barbells and doing the ""real"" lifts like squats and deadlifts


I was a size 14/16. Now I am, but my 12s are loose) -- poooooossibly an 8, depending on brand. Last time I weighed myself (again, a few months ago) I was at 160. Now I would guess I am probably 150?? I don't pay very much attention to weight because I don't want to get too obsessed; I've been trying to concentrate on health and abilities instead for progress.

I have gained muscle and feel more competent in lifting things. (I've actually started insisting on carrying things and my husband jokes that I am ""strong like bull."") I've noticed that I can do things like run to catch up with someone without losing breath. I can do from-the-toes pushups!

I'm about to break 100lbs on my squat and I'm super-excited about that.

Forewarning: Lengthy post

I was always naturally skinny (staying around 112 lbs) and never had a real problem with my weight until I got to college. I would go to class from 8-11 and then nap from 12 until 6 just in time for dinner. Everyday. And on the weekends I drank obscene amounts of beer. So inevitably, and an extra 10 my junior year. It was the new year of my junior year when I realized how much weight I had actually gained (I tried for a long time to ignore it and say that it wasn't really that bad) and that I had to make a change. I was 150 lbs, the largest ever.

So I started with the iphone app Couch to 5k because I've never been physically active my entire life. I'm just so uncoordinated and just an all around bad athlete. I really liked this program because it does build up your endurance. The first time I had to run 5 minutes straight

I didn't even notice that I'd lost that much. When I first started

After getting to about 130 lbs I plateaued for about a year and a half. I didn't eat crazy and watched what I ate here or there. But I never really worked out. I gave up on C25K when I couldn't run a full 20 minutes without stopping and I stopped working out. 

October 2013: I started the Paleo diet and starting strength and lost about 5 pounds. I gave up after a month.

January 2013: I moved away from home and started a new job. I had a lot of free time after working my 8-5 so I decided that I shouldn't just be okay with the weight that I was at and that I needed to be productive so I joined the gym New Year's Day and started again with C25k from the beginning. (I since have completed the program and can run 30 minutes straight!)

From then

**Beginning strength (Jan 2013):** 
    Standing Press: 35 lbs 3x10
    Squats: 95 3x10
    Bench: 45 3x10
    Deadlifts: 95 3x10

**Current strength (Apr 2013):**
    Standing Press: 45 5x5
    Squats: 145 5x5
    Bench: 65 5x5
    Deadlifts: 175 1x5

As you can see, I'm going to try and start cutting so that I can get a six pack but my main focus is again, gaining strength and being able to bench my body weight and deadlift two times my body weight. 

Sorry for the lengthy post

Can someone help me with a routine?,,44,8,29,"I recently returned to college (WOO I had dropped out) and now I have access to a gym and I'm so excited to get stronger and start lifting. Unfortunately I have absolutely no money so I can't purchase a book telling me what to do. I am really really interested in SS but the info I found online kind of confused me. But I wasn't going to let that stop me so I asked a guy who worked at the gym to show me how to squat and whatnot and what his routine was etc.

He told me something I bet a lot of you have heard before: ""I wouldn't lift heavy unless you want to get bulky"" ""women should do more reps at a lower weight""....I had to stop my eyes from rolling and subsequently glaring at him with the intensity of a flaming hawk. 

He would only let me do the bar at first (Which I understand) but then he said I should look at the ceiling (which I have heard contested) and he told me just to use the bar for a while

the problem being the bar alone does absolutely nothing for me whatsoever and I'm not even remotely tired after over 15 reps...?

So today I went in and he wasn't there so I put ten pounds on each side and I did 5x5...that was fairly easy too so I figure I'll go up next time...but then I was stuck...what do you do after you do front squats? Other squats?What are your leg days like? after I squatted I just went to the dumbells and did plie squats and front lunges/reverse lunges with 20-30 lb dumbbells at each side like I used to do when I worked out...then I was stuck again and I couldn't think of anything else to do with my legs...so I worked my abs and then did cardio...

what should I do? This sounds moronic

not to mention I""m the *only* woman in the weight room every single time I'm in there O.O that's intimidating enough haha

if I attempt deadlifts on my own after watching a demonstration video am I likely to hurt myself? do I do deadlifts like squats set-wise? what do I start with...? 

before I went to college all I had access to was 15 lb dumbbells and those were far too easy for me squat/lowerbody wise so I did a TON of jump squats of several variations...but I feel like I a lunatic if I do that in the gym...and I have no desire to do that anymore

so yes...I'm really new to this...does anyone have any tips for me...or an exact routine they can link me to?

So after a really upsetting week last week, **this has been a firecracker week!**

Measurements:

- 5'8"" (172cm): just for reference.. believe it or not this stat hasn't budged ;-)
- My weight has dropped to 63.5kg (140lb): that's a bit over 1kg (around 2-3lb) lost since I started
- Waist: 70cm (down 1cm or a half inch)
- Hips: 97cm (down 0.5cm)

Looking at those measurements

Current nutrition:

- Still 90% paleo
- 2050kcal on non-lifting days
- Macro split: Aiming for 25% carbs
- The above translates into about 130-140g carbs, I tend to go under on carbs and over on fats.

**[Photos: Week 0 to Week 5](http://imgur.com/a/uyJdB) (NSFW - underwear)**

Notes/Achievements:

- On Sunday I will be completing my final workout for Stage 1! I'll then do the two bonus workouts before taking a rest week and then starting on Stage 2. I can't wait! As many people have complained about before
- I have new back dimples! Can you see them? So proud!
- I realised **my squat weight was going backwards because I've been focussing on better form** and going lower. I reset on my last workout to just 24.5kg and will start working up from there again. It sucks to deload that much
- My rows and my lat pulldowns are finally moving up. Rows in particular have finally shifted to the next weight section
- **I can finally do full
- I'm really happy with the definition coming up on my stomach and my arms. I can really clearly see when I flex my abs now
- On a similar note
- Overall as you can see in the photos

I started working out at the end of May, abs are made in the kitchen.  Oddly enough my pizza, burgers, french fry, pasta, and only drinking soda diet doesn't really help my fitness goals.

However I'm waking up at 5:00 in the morning so I can get into better shape, fit body is junk food.

Today I actually remembered that I'm trying to eat healthy.  I know that sounds kinda dumb, gone home and made one meal, gone to sleep, then never touched the healthy stuff again.

But today, but was redirected to the food court.  I have free lunch where I work, so it's always difficult for me to pass up free Chick-fil-a or pizza.   Of course at that point I had gotten hungry and my mind was screaming ""pizza!"" However I made myself walk over to the salad station and made a spinach salad with mushrooms and carrots.

Then it hit me: plastic surgery and breast implants. Yes, that seems to be the only explanation. Huge ass silicone sacks in place of their natural boobs. But...Why? What the heck? Don't they work out to achieve a stronger, more capable body? Shouldn't they be proud of the muscles they have earned? Why do they need to change their bodies more? Is this what a strong woman's body is supposed to look like? Minimal amounts of body fat, but still maintaining huge lady curves? There is no way that all of us can achieve that naturally. I'm not hating on these women because they may have chosen to get cosmetic surgery, nor am I insinuating that I don't think that they look good. I have a problem with the way society seems to subtly pressure this kind of 'ideal' shape for women.

I felt much better with a little bit of a snack in me before I went, and I think the fact that I ran alone (well, the dog came with) and was only trying to keep up with myself and not trying to impress anyone really helped me keep my pace at something manageable.

Basically, but I'm naturally pretty muscular and hold my self pretty well at 135, so at this point I don't think the pounds matter as much as my physic. I'd love to slim down a bit more, as I have a nice layer of fat over my muscles. The problem is that I only know how to cut. I lift heavy and have been for about a year, but I'm afraid that if I increase my calories to maintenance (about 1600 or so for my height and current weight), I'm going to get fat again (Impossible. That's why it's called maintenance) or I'm not going to slim down at ALL and remain where I am. My tiny lizard brain is telling me if I eat more, then I'll just get heavy again

Right now this is what my work outs consist of:

**Arm day:**

Bench press

Upright rows

Shrugs

ez bar curls

lat pull down

occasional push ups

Leg raises


**Leg Day:**

Squats or deadlifts

weighted calf raises

Leg extensions

Leg curls

Leg raises

They way I lift (and correct me if I should be doing it a different way, and then work my way back down again. 5 reps each set)
I lift every other day

**Maxes:**

Bench: 100

Deadlift: 170

Squat: 135

Push ups: 42

I eat clean, I'm just not sure HOW MUCH to eat to lose inches of fat while gaining solid muscle. I don't give a shit about the scale anymore, just about my physic and fitness.

1374001205.0,1ifjxo,X-post from /r/fitness: the effort to run a a linear progression program (and thoughts on life in general),lonewolfx77,44,10,10,"*First off


Someone gifted me gold for this comment in a different thread

Before SS -&gt; After SS (sorry

Age: 23 -&gt; 23

Height: 5'9"" -&gt; 5'9""

Weight: under 130lbs -&gt; 150lbs

Lifts:

Squat: 135x3x5 (too high

Bench: 95x3x5 -&gt; 155x3x5

Deadlift: 160x5 -&gt; 275x3

OHP: 55x3x5 -&gt; 105x3x5


So I had fairly typical results for 3 1/2 months of SS for a healthy (albiet very skinny) male. I had my share of stalls and form issues, GSLP, whatever), but really the fundamentals can be applied to many facets of life. Here's my (slightly edited) post that hopefully helps some people out:


Don't forget


At some point you're going to have to make a choice. It's probably not going to be black and white, and join the mediocrity parade. Or, you're going to get a little crazy twitch in your eye, crank your music a little louder, and bang out that one more set. Those last three reps. That one last god-forsaken pull off the floor.


Eventually, you'll hit the same weight.
This is the test. This is going to separate success from failure. Strength from mediocrity. You from people who quit every time something gets difficult. Most would assume they can just coast through their old stalls


This time, strain against the weight, and lockout that final rep.
And when that happens


So that about sums up my experience with linear progression. The shit sucks real bad after a bit. Suck it up


My last bit of advice for those nearing the end of linear progression would be to have some sort of ""next step"" planned, before I made up my mind to just stick with TM for more than 6 weeks. You might not think you're hurting your progress, but now I'm almost a year out from February with lifts not as high as I would like.

I just squatted a sun bear (plus a small cat haha) for the first time! My last rep was a little rough and I had to pause at the bottom

This is a major milestone for me... I started NROLW about four weeks ago (this was my 5th Workout A for anyone that knows that program) and I was too scared to even try to squat the bar. I started with one of those 18 pound body bars, too, which I am just so excited about. I know that most of my progress is just from learning how to do the lifts properly, but I also had to learn how to not give a shit about what all the guys were thinking and just push myself to my limits. That's been the hardest part!

Anyway, and the difference in my energy levels now that I'm eating 2000+ calories a day is amazing. I'm still working on getting over the guilt of eating so much, but I'm starting to realize that I need to fuel my body if I'm going to make any progress.

My body works against me (I have hypothryoidism that has been under medicated by an older doctor and while new doctor is adjusting the medication it does have to be done slowly). 


I am walking a fair bit these days. I'm adding in yoga and strength training. I've got myself some light weights (I'm starting with 2lbs because my 5lbs ones dislocate my shoulders). 


I told my partner about the changes I am trying to make to my life. He thinks it is in my head and that I don't need to drop any weight. So I tell him I am trying to eat healthy and he brings home 11 Cadbury Cream eggs for me. Under our living room table he has stashed:

Orange candy slices. 
Gummy worms. 
Ferriro Rochier (large box) 
Wine Gums
100 g bar of Cadbury Chocolate
A large bag of jelly beans. 
A large bag of dark chocolate almonds. 

In the cupboard we have:
Doritos 
Regular Chips
All dressed chips. 
Chocolate chip cookies. 

Daily he texts me to say we can just order a pizza instead of cooking. 


He also has a habit of buying beer. He doesn't drink. I have a soft spot for coming home tired from work and drinking beer. I have tried telling him not to buy any (I'm not buying any). I don't want it in the house at all because it's too easy to come home and have one or two. 

We had an unopened case in the fridge and tonight we had guests. Once a week I make dinner for our friends. Tonight he bought an extra case so now we have a case and a half (because barely anyone drinks beer). And of course the beer he brings home is an imported case of one of my favs. I feel like he is trying to set me up for failure.  

I am trying so hard to have will power and to make healthy choices about what I am putting into my body. But at this point I am hoping the gastroentronologist that I am going to see in the summer puts me on an elimination diet so that I can reasonably ban all this stuff from our common areas and push it into his office. 

I do keep having this conversation with him and he apologizes and stops buying me junk for a few days and then it starts again.

For context

I was relatively active in college at the gym (played rugby and worked out semi-regularly)

In the month post-graduation, they eat A LOT of pasta, cheese, fatty meats, and desserts. Very carb heavy, very vegetable/fruit scarce. Of course, I've tried to limit by portion sizes and refuse unhealthy foods when I can, and I often don't have a choice

I don't have access to a gym or weights here (this is a very small town on the Italian riviera) but I've taken up light jogging and swimming when I can, and would like to be at 130-ish when I get back to the States in September, and reunite with my boyfriend with a sexy new bod! 

Do you have any tips or tricks to breaking through the plateau and shedding the extra 16 lbs over the next 10 weeks that doesn't necessarily have to do with diet?

&gt;**Weightlifting Performance Standards Tables**

&gt;The standards presented in the following tables represent a performance
that can be reasonably expected of an athlete at various levels of training
advancement using standard full range-of-motion barbell exercises. 

&gt;In the tables above
individual who has not trained on the exercise before but can perform it
correctly. This represents the minimum level of strength required to maintain a
reasonable quality of life in a sedentary individual. 

&gt;**""Novice""** means a person training regularly for a period of 3-9 months. This strength level supports the
demands of vigorous recreational activities. 

&gt;An **""intermediate""** is a person who has engaged in regular training for up to two years. The intermediate level
indicates some degree of specialization in the exercises and a high level of
performance at the recreational level. 

&gt;The term **""advanced""** refers to an individual with multi-year training experience with definite goals in the higher levels of
competitive athletics. 

&gt;The term **""elite""** refers specifically to athletes competing in
strength sports. Less than 1% of the weight training population will attain this
level.

**[Follow me on Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/Dodge87)**

**Update on the cut:**

- The cut is going really well
- This week saw the end of exams for the semester, I'm not beating myself up over it. I don't often get to drink so I had my fun with my friends and now I'm trucking along.
- That said
- It shot back up to 63.8kg in the two days after drinking - which says to me that I was dehydrated and my body was reacting to the huge calorie intake. 
- It's now back down to 63.3 so heading in the right direction again.
- **More importantly than the scale are my measurements: ALL of which have started dropping** again and are breaking my own records

**I think the impact of the cut is starting to become clear in [these NSFW progress photos](http://imgur.com/kFvIO0x)** 

*(Please note that I am kinda cheating by wearing a push-up bra in the last set of photos

**My failure Friday**

- I posted these in the weekly thread but due to time zones I got a bit buried
- On Friday at the gym I was aiming to try for 20kg (45lb) thrusters with the olympic bar. I picked up the bar, which I also completed relatively easily. Feeling awesome for progressing so well, I went to put the bar back on the rack, since it was deracked when I found it. It was then that I realised... it was a women's 15kg bar... **I had been lifting 5kg lighter than I thought**, meaning I hadn't progressed - I had gone backwards! 
- **[I kinda went from deadlift bruises to deadlift sores](http://imgur.com/QN1P95R)**. Ow. Also excuse the leg hair... it's winter here!

**The program itself**

- I still find the horizontal wood chop awkward
- My shoulder has been playing up again but only on days when I'm not lifting. For some reason lifting actually makes it feel better!
- I went back to the wooden bar and perfected my form on the wide-grip deadlift from box. The graphics in the book really helped me work out what I had been doing wrong. Specifically
- After failing to do the right weight, so I accepted that the session was over and I'd make up for it next time.
- I'm working out today and thinking that I will add some back squats in after deadlifts just so I can work on progressing at these.
- **That squatting thread the other day really gave me a reality check on my rate of progress.** Specifically
- After some reflection I think NROLFW is perfect for beginners and aesthetics
- For this reason

I recently decided to make some lifestyle changes after a rough year full of personal losses.  I joined a gym that came highly recommended by some friends as being inexpensive but effective.

I was embarrassed and discouraged -- he really made it seem like I was not going to be able to work out effectively without the help of a trainer.  I simply cannot afford one.  It wouldn't be a matter of cutting elsewhere -- I am getting by right now

Now I know that it's a sale he's trying to make

As I said, but I need to get myself moving physically.  What kinds of cardio or resistance training do you ladies do?  I had anticipated heading to the gym 4 days a week to begin with.  Too much or too little?  Or just right?

I did use the search function and came up with some results

Sure, the “why do you want to be strong?” question. I’ve heard the usual “why would you want to look like that?”, “Bodybuilding women are gross”, and “That’s too much muscle”. But lately, I’ve been watching WHERE the majority of those comments are coming from, and too my great disappointment, more frequently than any other demographic


When I think of the people who encourage me to lift, and its my guy friends who routinely ask me how my numbers are doing. And its my girl friends who tell me that I’m “too masculine”, and that “I don’t need that strength” and even attack me for having ""high testosterone"". In the same breath, those same girls tell me how they wish my had my body, that I was “lucky” to eat so much and stay “thin”.

Now,diet, and fitness. Lately, I’ve felt like there may be a light at the end of that tunnel, but sadly, for everyone truly enlightened women, two more seem to shut their eyes against it. There is very little we can do for a woman who absolutely refuses to see science and reason. However, inadvertently

The other day a girl asked me if I lifted to lose weight. And I nearly laughed like she had told me some joke before I realized that she was actually looking for a reason to get into it. After talking with her I realized, fat fool.

So I was part of the problem. I was one of the barriers between women and lifting. I was a discouraging factor. And now I see it everywhere. Not just in my actual life, I took a different approach. When the topic is brought up in anyway now, I focus less on why I like being strong and hate cardio and love having muscles, and more on how it takes care of my body. I speak more on how empowering it feels, and how it relaxes me and affects my moods. I’ll pull up articles and explain why we don’t function like men, and I show them different bodies of people that lift, including my own. Two weeks ago

- I found the horizontal woodchop awkward
- On that topic, this is the 21st century, why not record some official form vids so people can see exactly what you're trying to get us to do.
- Fitocracy's lack of appropriate exercises to log is frustrating
- I really enjoyed the addition of the HIIT for 15mins at the end of the workout. Although this does lengthen workout time significantly
- After struggling with the wide-grip deadlift
- As per [my feats of Thorsday comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1hmuum/weekly_thread_feats_of_thorsday_behold_our/caw6c9f) I've added in an accessory/flexibility day since my hamstring tightness has become a serious issue for my squats, so I'll be adding these into every single workout from hereon in to really work on my left side in particular.
- I enjoyed thrusters a lot

**Stage 3 ahead**

- I finish up my course this weekend. It involves a lot of lifting/moving throughout the day so I've decided not to begin on Stage 3 until next week

Feel free to answer any or all of these questions to the best of your ability


 
Since summer is approaching (at least in the Northern Hemisphere, I thought a good topic to put out is about eating and weight loss!  


**Eating and weight loss**:  
- How many calories should I eat to lose weight?  
- MyFitnessPal says I should be eating ___ calories a day. Is that a good amount?  
- I'm eating at a deficit and not losing any weight. What's going on? OR Could I be overeating/undereating?  
- What do I do if I eat a LOT on one day/week? Should I eat less the next day/week?  
- Why do people keep saying that the number on the scale isn't important? Are there any examples of women looking better at a   higher weight?

Sometimes it can feel like such an uphill battle - with misinformation and destructive lifestyle factors (and people) discouraging you and making you question yourself. I have finally started to come to peace with myself and you were the catalyst!

For context, I struggled with bingeing, over-exercising, and generally bad habits and couldn’t get out of the cycle. I had read several comments on xxfitness about “eating enough” and I thought “well, that won’t work for me. I need to eat as little as possible during the week so I can have my cheat weekends!” I would be netting 1000 cal a day during the week (eating 1500 and doing pretty hefty workouts) and then completely going off the rails on the weekends. I would literally spend all day Friday through Sunday stuffing my face with everything I could find. I thought that it was working for me, because my lifts were increasing and my measurements were staying consistent, even though my weight was creeping up. Well, and for the first time in almost a year I am not miserable! I didn’t realize how much my unbalanced lifestyle was affecting me.

I also came to the realization that the program that started it all had contributed to me developing a disordered eating pattern because I had essentially starved myself for 12 weeks without realizing it (I thought that my period just went away due to normal hormone fluctuations and that my libido died a natural death). The weight I had lost was as much muscle as fat. The worst part is

So as you can probably gather from the title (and from my noob question on Tuesday), and knowing what I know now about exercise and lifting, I thought to myself ""It doesn't have to be this complex!"" so I went to one of the simplest lifting routines around, StrongLifts 5x5. 

**But before I begin

**[A month-by-month look at my progress this year](http://i.imgur.com/bCq2iqF.jpg)**

As you can see, and I let myself adjust to things before changing. **The biggest lesson I have learnt is that if you are frustrated or upset about your progress, you're best to wait a week before changing your diet or routine**, because it can be an emotional rollercoaster and it's easy to have a bad day and think about throwing it all away. 

Anyway, who like variety, and who need a good read to kick them out of that old-fashioned mindset that eating less is always better.

StrongLifts is a very different program in that it never changes, despite not having lost a pound. On this, I've come to realise that my TDEE is lower now that I've lost the weight, so I've had to adjust my cut to 1600 calories a day, + 200 on lifting days. I'm only 2kg (about 4.5lbs) away from my goal weight, and I'm very much looking forward to reaching it so I can bring my calories back up and basically swim in bacon.

My starting stats and progress so far for SL5x5:

Lift | Start | Current
--| --| --|
Squat | 29kg / 64lb  | 34.5kg / 76lb
Bench | 22.5kg / 50lb | 24.5 / 54lb
OHP | 20kg / 44lb | NA
Row | 27kg / 60lb | 29.5 / 65lb
Deadlift | 50kg / 110lb | NA

For those not familiar with it, Bench and Row. Workout B is Squat, OHP and Dead. All are 5x5 except the dead, which is 1x5. 

Some notes about my impressions:

- I can see this being a lot more motivating
- I'm looking forward to testing out my strength as time goes on
- I didn't realise I should stay at one weight for each workout
- Next workout I'm going to test out my deadlift 1RM because I'm super curious about whether I can bust past my bodyweight. I'm pretty confident of a yes
- The greatest thing about StrongLifts is that I can do it at my home gym in the garage - I don't need any of the equipment at the gym and as such it's making me consider scrapping my gym memberships and saving some serious cash.
- I've added in a small amount of accessory work, but we'll see - and I'm working on another goal, which is to do a handstand.
I'm already feeling the chin-ups becoming easier since I started dedicating myself to them a bit more
- Motivation is high and I'm liking the results
- I am, where you can feel the muscle building underneath the fat. It's in there, and the scale is holding steady despite my cut, so I'm guessing it'll drop in a few weeks and I'll be pretty thrilled to get rid of this gluggy feeling
- My appetite has also increased again and I'm feeling very hungry
- To answer a question from a previous post: No, umm, rest :p

My friend is used to cardio theater and bodypump classes

So, not paying enough attention to my demonstration of breathing, foot position, bar position and torso angle. She just kept looking around the room. She said she felt like everyone was staring at us, but I didn't see anyone doing that. I know how intimidating it can be to just waltz into a fairly male-dominated area like you belong there, but she was taking the paranoia to the next level. 

When it came time for her to get under the bar and try out a barbell squat

We went upstairs, the bars are not long enough, but also they weigh maybe a 1/2 a lb? For emphasis I tossed it in the air with one hand, caught it and started twirling it like a baton. After the look of horror on her face passed, she agreed to go try squatting the 45lb bar downstairs. 

She's got to work on her squat depth

Bench was fantastic

Deadlifts were a little trickier.  No bumper plates meant she had to hold the bar at the start position and lower it back down.  I'm used to being able to lever the bar to unload/load plates so wasn't quite sure how to do it with the bar just lying on the ground

Things I assume you know:

- To gain weight/bulk you need to eat your TDEE + 10-20%
- You should focus on getting enough protein as your #1 macro to concern yourself with
- Lifting heavy is the best exercise to do when bulking if you're trying to gain muscle instead of fat
- **/r/xxgainit and /r/gainit exist and are awesome - visiting and subbing to those communities is one of my unlisted tips! You can also go there to find loads of info about GOMAD

##Any attempts to increase calories will be hard when you've adapted to a lower amount

**My Top 10 Tips for Eating More:**

^(Note that I may edit these based on feedback/suggestions and since it will be linked in the sidebar)

- **1. Add natural oils and sugars into your cooking:** Fats and sugars both concentrate a large number of calories into a relatively small amount of food, coconut oil, butter, etc. into your meals is an easy way to add some extra calories. 1 tablespoon of honey is 50 calories, 1 tablespoon of olive oil is 100-120 calories, and 1 tablespoon of butter is also 100-120 calories. Some folks will even go as far as to carry a little bottle of oil around with them to add to all their salads and any meals they eat while out and about.
- **2. Snack on nuts and nut butters:** Despite their small appearance
- **3. Drink your calories with great shakes and juices:** This is the enemy of weight loss, to result in a 370 calorie drink. I used water but if you used something like milk/almond milk/similar then you would get even more calories in. I used to drink this in between meals or even following a full breakfast - it honestly doesn't feel like very much!
- **4. Eat bacon and other fatty meats:** As with the first tip
- **5. Use bigger plates:** Nope not barbell plates - though they will help give you the muscle you're after! Use larger plates and bowls when serving yourself a meal and you'll naturally eat more. Increasing plate size is a quick way to get more food inside you while still (psychologically) feeling like you're eating the same amount. 
- **6. Be a dugong and graze:** My favourite animal is a dugong (surprise!): the ones held in captivity eat 50kg (110lbs) of cos lettuce a day, no matter how lightweight and small, that you can 'graze' on all day - for example popcorn. It may not be chock-a-block with calories, but it does get you used to just automatically dipping the hand and munching the contents. You can also do this with nuts, squares of dark chocolate, carrot sticks, celery sticks
- **7. Don't wait until you're hungry:** When losing weight, it's important to do the opposite: plan your meals and stick to them! If you're taking the advice above, it may be that you feel more satisfied throughout the day, and therefore aren't feeling hungry when large mealtimes roll around. *Do not let that stop you*. If you're serious about this, you have to get your body adjusted to eating when your brain tells it to, rather than just when it's craving it. Because you're eating more energy than you need as part of your plan, your body may not like it or want to cooperate. Eat something anyway!
- **8. Protein bars, protein... umm.. anything:** There are approximately 1 gazillion blog posts online with protein-based recipes for delicious cupcakes, pancaked, muffins, home-made bars, shakes, cakes, cookies etc. If you want something sweet to supplement your diet
- **9. Eat fruit:** OK so this one you can take or leave depending on your opinion on naturally-occurring sugars and the whole sugar = toxin thing that many people believe. Personally, and can easily be blended into shakes or juices. For me, 1-2 bananas a day helped a LOT when just trying to get some extra calories in. Find a fruit of your choice that you find easy to eat on a whim and go for it!
- **10. Sweet potato is your friend:** I'm a total sucker for sweet potato (also known as kumera). Do you remember how you transitioned away from eating french fries or rice or pasta or bread with every meal when you were cutting? Well, these are a good way to add 200-300 calories to your proteiny dinners!

I believe these results were accomplished with a combination of lots of squats with weights, in addition to really focusing on adding more protein into my diet. I do weight training 3 times per week and cardio 2 times per week. On my cardio days I either run or do Insanity. Sometimes I go to spin classes. On my weight training days, I only focus on my legs because my arms are already pretty muscular and I've really wanted to focus on toning my legs.

As an aside

So

- Munchie Mondays: A thread each week focussing on a different topic, a particular eating/diet plan (e.g. paleo, keto, show diets), technologies (e.g. HR monitors, calorie counters), and so forth.
- Newbie Tuesday: Perhaps just a simple weekly thread that gives people a chance to ask any of the more basic questions they have, we could make it topic-based. What do you think?
- Feats of Thorsday: This has been running really well I think - it always annoys me that I miss the rush because of timezones
- I was doing my Question of the Day for a while but that proved a bit tough to keep up what with life and so on. Perhaps a QOW (Question of the Week) instead? Say on Friday nights US time?

I started cutting in August to get rid of some of the weight I had put on during college. And I was GOLDEN. I started with a 500 kcal a day deficit and dropped about 20lbs with ease. I love to cooking, a bit of cream and sugar in my coffee. I am a big proponent of overall lifestyle changes rather than drastic cuts in the things I enjoy and I was able to maintain this while losing weight. I began going to the gym and loved it

I haven't lost a single lb since Feb 1 since my calories dipped below 1450 a day and I am just burned out with cutting. I haven't lost any inches either. Part of my exhaustion with cutting is coming from having to cut out the small treats. Another part is feeling like I can only eat chicken breast and tilapia to hit my protein goals.

I've tried resetting mechanisms that worked in the past few months - take a break to reset hormone levels/production

I am at my wit's end with this - I am cranky and feeling like I am always recovering from DOMS at some point or another. Around my period

I *mentally* know the solution is to just bite the bullet and start eating more, but it's just feeling so far away right now. 

Basically

Second question: mind over emotions. how the hell do you guys *mentally* deal with cutting for long stretches? What keeps you motivated?

I am SteelPenguin71, embraces the campus cafeteria (I've gotta use my food plan, right?!), and the pounds fly on. Freshman year I started at around 140lbs (I'm 5'4'') and pretty fit. In high school I did sports all the time (swimming, track and field, cross country). In college I was a member of the university marching band. While that was an exhausting endeavor and gave me a fair share of workout, it wasn't as rigorous as my training for sports in high school. 

It has been seven years of little workout and lots of eating and I am now 251lbs as of this morning. I can no longer participate in activities that I love as easily as I could before. I can't go for a run without my knees hating me, and I'm a strong swimmer. I went backpacking over the weekend, an activity that I love. I've poured so much money into gear and stuff for it because I love it. Then I realized half of my clothes no longer fit, and I hated being the one lagging behind the group because I physically couldn't keep up. I miss being the happy-go-lucky leader of the trail. The realization that my weight is now keeping me from things that make me happy is, I think, a big wakeup call. 

On top of all of that, belly that makes me look pregnant, hips a mile wide, butt that you could land a [C-5 Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-5_Galaxy) on...

I also know I need to lose weight to be healthy. My family has a history of heart conditions, so I need to start a more healthy lifestyle. Of all my reasons to lose weight, this is the most important one, without a doubt.
