1347372983.0,zpj6b,[Meta]: Attention Downvote Brigade,koronicus,219,106,306,"Greetings!

Some of you may have found us through a post like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/zoyxr/atheismplus_the_death_of_debate_in_part_of_the/). Let me be the first to roll out the red carpet and welcome you to our humble abode. I would like to express my warmest affections for your taking the time to visit us today. I have the utmost confidence that, since many of you are already skeptics, you will understand our reticence to allow this subreddit to devolve into a giant ""introduction to social justice"" class in much the same manner as /r/evolution might object to becoming a Creatonism Talking Points page.

On your right, failure to adhere to this code of conduct may result in ~~bullying~~ banning. With the best interests of the larger community in mind, I hope the majority of you find these guidelines tenable and join us in participating in a healthy reddit community.

Again

~

To the members of the /r/atheismplus community (including today's new members!)

Hello to you too! If you see any instances of our code of conduct being violated, and general asshole-dom, but feel free to help bring violations to our attention. Please also be aware that many of our visitors today may not be terribly interested in good-faith discussions. We have already seen a surge of drive-by downvoting, and I hope you'll bear with us until the moment passes. (And hey, now's a great time to familiarize yourself with the upvote button! Orange isn't my favorite color, personally, but I do enjoy spreading around the sweet, and I couldn't recommend it any more highly.)

As always

~

Edit: I should probably give everyone a personalized welcome. It's the only equal thing to do, and I'll add it here!)

~

Hi r/skeptic! I just want you to know how very disappointed in you I am if you just came here to downvote stuff without reading everything in context. That's not very skeptical of you! Thankfully, and you've probably already taken the time to investigate. Feel free to hang around--we have cookies. (The cookies are sweet, sweet karma.)

~

*Hi SRD!* Sorry you've had to endure us twice now. If it were up to me, I'm not really sure. Do you *enjoy* the drama? I've never been entirely clear on whether it's hilarious or horrible.)

~

Hi r/atheism! Uh, aren't they?) So hey, like, if you think it's really shitty how certain people get treated (you know, like, for having boobies or dark skin or whatever), you should hang out here.

To those of you who are new, which I think is pretty nifty. The forums are still just a little ahead of us in membership count, though, so bring some friends! Those of you who are new are encouraged to review the sidebar, paying special attention to [those](http://atheismplus.com/?page_id=127) [links](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/q24sl/meta_srsd_required_reading/) [in](http://derailingfordummies.com/complete.html) [blue](http://www.atheismplus.com), which offer valuable resources for your perusal. We've seen a few recurring topics in the last few days that I'd like to address. It seems that a lot of our more critical passers-through lack an understanding of what this idea of a ""safe space"" means, erroneously conflating it with some kind of enforced groupthink, shall we?

- Safe Space

This page is a safe space intended to facilitate discussions about intersectional issues such as religion and social justice. [What is a ""safe space?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/zntcf/what_is_a_safe_space/) At its core, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, a safe space is a moderated forum where certain kinds of speech are curtailed to prevent harassment

1. Slurs: -ist language is not permitted. That one *should be* pretty self-explanatory
2. [Trigger Warnings](http://privilege101.tumblr.com/triggers.html): Use these where applicable [as a common courtesy](http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/07/19/trigger-warning/). They can sometimes be something of a judgment call, add them as requested. This shows that [you care](http://libcom.org/blog/trigger-warnings-why-we-use-them-15012012). (See also: [the Spoon Theory](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/)) In general, we expect everyone to make a good faith effort at avoiding triggering language. Where applicable, hide such language behind a [CSS trigger warning](/trigger).
3. [Concern trolling](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Concern_troll): This is not acceptable. As a general guideline
4. Hostility: (Note: The following rule does not apply to trolls, being angry does not make someone wrong. Still, try to avoid disrespecting one another—attack the argument, not the person. Furthermore, if you are hostile to this whole Atheism+ thing, or to the core values listed in the sidebar, don't participate.

Note: This being a safe space does not protect your ideas from scrutiny. If you come bearing incidentally hurtful or bigoted notions

- Free Speech

This is not your house, and if you do not wish to be a part of that community, don't. If you think we're just the most horrible thing ever to happen to the world, [go whine about us to someone else](http://www.reddit.com/r/antiatheismplus/). On this page, we are interested in neither discussing the necessity of Atheism+ nor debating the talking points of your preferred anti-feminist group.

- Groupthink

This is a charge that continues to astound me. Atheism+ is entirely devoid of ""official"" positions outside its core value statements, if you think any of this constitutes a policy of enforcing groupthink, [you do not understand what that word means](http://www.psysr.org/about/pubs_resources/groupthink%20overview.htm).

- [Feminism](http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/01/26/feminist-dogma/)

Feminism is the belief that men and women should be equal. If you believe this definition is fudamentally inaccurate, and feminism exists (or rather, feminisms exist) to improve society for everyone on the gender spectrum. (PS: [No, feminists aren't sexist against men](http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2003/09/feminists_are_sexist).)

- [Privilege](http://tjlp.org/privilege101.pdf)

If being told to ""[check your privilege](http://blog.shrub.com/archives/tekanji/2006-03-08_146)"" causes you to roll your eyes reflexively, beliefs, and attitudes [are not shared by the entire world](https://sindeloke.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/37/), and there really are people out there who know things better than you do. What works for you does not work equally well for everyone else. Do not [condesplain](http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/01/25/you-may-be-a-mansplainer-if/) here.

- [Derailing](http://derailingfordummies.com/complete.html)

Using these tactics is highly likely to be interpreted as an effort to disrupt conversation. If you wish to be seen as arguing in good faith, start your own thread.

- Basic Questions

If you are unfamiliar with a concept being discussed

- Good Faith

We do not assume that newcomers act in good faith. This is the Internet, this means demonstrating an interest in honest discussions (see: basic questions) and avoiding [loaded language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question). Refusal to argue in good faith is a bannable offense. (Pro tip: saying ""I'll probably get banned for saying this"" is taken as an *ipso facto* demonstration of bad faith argumentation.)

- Moderator Action

By participating in this subreddit, running off to another subreddit (unless it's [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/antiatheismplus/)) to cry or brag about being banned here will result in your being made a public spectacle of, as deemed appropriate by the International Court of Justice of the United Nations.

I went. I have been going for about a year now, one of the gentlemen I don't normally talk to was sitting close to me. He decided to announce with a wink and a nod that atheism+ was problematic. 

I asked him why he thought that

I asked him to explain his viewpoint

I stopped him

Then, and wasn't it obvious? People in Atheism+ were ""playing"" the victim, like ""that Rebecca from Skepchick"". He referenced feminists as villains. 

I wasn't alone in asking him to explain what that all meant. In the end I said I was a feminist, and for me the logic of being an atheist was to reject these gender roles, and also be a feminist. 

He poo poo'd that

I found it very frustrating. Apparently

It's not all bad

This is a great example of applying social justice language to the atheist movement. I'm wondering if there's another kind of privilege

I have a mostly atheist family

For atheists who used to be religious, religion is a very real threat. They have to deal with cognitive dissonance, guilt, shame and rejection. They've been told that their religion is the only source of meaning, and now they've lost that source and they have to find something new. I know at least two friends who deal with depression as a direct result of losing their faith (according to their own explanation). These are the people who really need the atheist movement to support them.

On the other end, the harm of religion is hypothetical, exaggerated, or just not their problem. Their experience of religious people is of nice old ladies who say ""bless you"", and the worst thing they have to deal with is Mormons knocking on their door once a year. 

I wonder if that's why so many people see us as being too ""aggressive"", (quick privilege check: I have both of these privileges, among others).

I don't know of any statistics that can back me up here, and to have a lower opinion of the atheist movement on average. If this privilege is a real thing, it could be useful to know about. What do you think?

Ophelia Benson wrote a [post](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/01/from-hacking-to-acid-throwing/) on the awful acid attack that happened to the director of the Bolshoi Ballet last week. Her post remarked on the [similarities between the ballet company and atheist community](http://i.imgur.com/GVFYPX1.png).

Well, as a commenter on the blog posted pointed out, we haven't [already seen this kind of obsessive hatred against a few women lead to violence in the atheist community before, with Madalyn Murray-O’Hair.](http://i.imgur.com/ukO5AkE.png)

[Ophelia further explains her post] (http://i.imgur.com/Iz6tpgr.png)

Like I said

I suppose it makes sense both to threaten Ophelia with acid to the face while simultaneously insulting her appearance. Seems like a rational and appropriate response.

----

Now, I've heard enough about it through various blog posts but I very much wanted to believe it wasn't really *that bad*. It is that bad. I thought, ""Surely, I will go there and they will be categorically condemning Jerry Conlon's tweet as despicable with fullest sympathies extended towards Ophelia.

Yes, Jan Steen, but some of us simply don't have that privilege.

Alright

Great! Was it impossible to call out Conlon on his statement without using gendered slurs? Or just not preferable? Is there any possible justification for this?

""Why are these women so angry?""

First things first, and some people who do not identify along the binary. Even those not directly affected have cause to be upset by the attempted denial of basic human rights, however.

Maybe your first reaction is to think, they won't be so angry.""

No. You ['splaining](http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/01/25/you-may-be-a-mansplainer-if/) Dawkins's position will not help. The problem is not a lack of understanding what he's trying to communicate. The problem is *what he's trying to communicate.*

Dawkins is saying that it's possible for fetal pain to override the potential parent's right to bodily autonomy. The consequence of this argument is the following: ""Oh

Now at this point, Dawkins is actually pro-choice!"" And if that's the case, congratulations! You've completely missed the point. The inner working of Dawkins's mind, his thoughts and beliefs, are not relevant because *his argument* supports denying a basic right to anyone with a uterus.

There's also a possibility that you're about to respond with, he's conceded the larger issue. [Without argument or justification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question), he accepted the core anti-choice premise upon which all anti-choice arguments rest: that someone who is capable of carrying a fetus does not have the right to bodily autonomy.

Thus

Sadly, after all, that we call [tu quoque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) a logical fallacy. It's not a valid argument.

Next, it just *entertains the idea*. The conclusion depends on the amount of fetal pain, so if science shows us that that pain doesn't exceed our arbitrary threshold for denying these people the right to control their own bodies, then we're all good!"" Except no, we're not all good here because the implicit message is ""If your fetus can feel pain (or X amount of pain), your desires about your own body do not matter."" By this reasoning, a small clump of underdeveloped cells is assumed to be more important than the actual human being. This argument contends that because a fetus *might* experience brief pain, the actual human being would be subjected to a drawn-out mentally

Again, it couldn't override the right to bodily integrity. I'm surprised that Dawkins was apparently not aware of this, but because his background is in evolutionary (not developmental) biology, perhaps I shouldn't be. The fact, however, that Dawkins is a famous biologist lends false validity to the anti-choicers' beliefs in the same way that global warming denialists point to scientists studying unrelated fields to justify their denial of climate science.

It's important to remember that Dawkins isn't *starting* a conversation here. It would be irrational to think that this isn't part of a larger ongoing narrative. The war on reproductive rights is an unrelenting [global](http://www.guttmacher.org/sections/abortion.php) phenomenon. It's too common to find people who argue against the legal rights of any ~~baby factory~~ person with a functioning uterus.

Furthermore

For most guys, for example: [US](http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/government-and-you/state-governments/key-findings-threats-to-choice.html), [Canada](http://www.morgentaler25years.ca/the-struggle-for-abortion-rights/,%20%5BUK%5D(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19856314), [UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19856314), [Australia](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/prolife-advocates-rally-against-abortion-20130205-2dw9e.html), [South Africa](http://www.scross.co.za/2012/08/being-truly-pro-life/)). [Violence is committed upon or threatened to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence) those who perform or support abortion services. This is a high-stakes argument.

The people at risk of losing their personal freedom as a result of this argument do not have the luxury of complacency. Is it any wonder

Contrary to Dawkins's apparent belief that stoicism is a necessary component of rationality, then, would we expect someone whose uterus may end up government property to respond apathetically?

I don't doubt Dawkins means well. Sadly, I support you, except for the fact that I don't think you have this right that I enjoy."" This is no better than simply remaining silent on the issue; indeed, being friendly fire, this is much more painful. Allies should not be vicariously ceding rights to the opposition.

And finally, and that consent can be denied or withdrawn. Pregnancy and birth are processes that invoke radical changes in a person's body, and forcing someone to undergo this is a gross violation of their right to bodily autonomy. We do not mandate more minor violations of this right (eg, giving blood, organ donation), so it is not acceptable to mandate this extreme violation. [Moral absolutism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism) is something different--something that gives us ""X is wrong because the Bible says so"" style reasoning. Consequentialist reasoning allows us to hold that the cold-blooded murder of an innocent person is absolutely wrong. This is no different.

1347505052.0,zsx4p,I've been here reading discussions and trying to formulate my own opinion on atheism+ since I found this sub a week ago. I've come to the conclusion that I am on board. Here's why:,pj_fry_jr,64,31,20,"    Apologies for the wall of text. 
    This is kind of a brain dump from a week of contemplation. 

* I do think that atheism has lead me to care about things like social justice and equal rights, then of course it's up to us (humans) to do it. That is just my own conclusion which I hold no one else to. The logical conclusion of how to conduct one's self in light of the rejection of god claims varies widely I'm sure, which leads to the most used argument against the concept of atheism+ that I've seen so far. That is, atheism should only be one thing: lack of belief in god/s, and that if we start drawing conclusions from that one thing, all hell will break loose and religious people will be right when they say things like ""atheism leads to mao!"". My reply to that is: Welcome to reality, where some people are irrational. I'm sure it's possible for someone to conclude that since there is no god to punish them, but I think they're wrong and that's part of the reason I'm here. There is no objective right or wrong, but it's reality.

* I'm sick of the idea of ""don't feed the trolls"". I've never really had any trouble irl standing up to assholes, that when you really confront them and get to their motivation, they'll say that they don't really feel that way but that they just think it's funny to treat women like they do. It seems obvious to me at least, that, that is bullshit and they're just trying to reconcile their shitty behavior by detaching themselves from their own humanity. It must be confusing, but regardless, these troll sentiments are not insincere as some would like you to believe. 

* The level of push-back (and the vitriol involved) to the very idea of atheism+ basically proves the need for its existence imo. The fact that maybe some people haven't seen the harassment or generally shitty behavior and use that as the basis for saying it isn't a problem is something I wouldn't have expected to see in the atheist community but I admit to being naive about that kind of thing. I'm a white male, maybe b/c I go looking for it, but often it's blatantly obvious and I don't know how it is going unseen. Tbh, I don't think it is. I think the reasoning behind sacrificing a welcoming environment in favor of allowing assholes to harass people is the free speech argument (which reminds me of christians in the u.s. claiming persecution for not being able to discriminate), slippery slope and all that. It may be a narrow edge to traverse, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Maybe we'll slip, hell, but we'll climb back up and keep trying. I'll always be in favor of not associating myself w/ assholes.

So, but I thought I should sound off on this. Thanks for reading and thanks for creating this place.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,1347521397.0,,

Now, but this really made the tone argument problem a ton clearer for me. 

The problem is pretty straight-forward - where do you draw the line between ""words matter"" and tone-trolling. I know both when I see it

This is how I read that sentence from Kassiane:

I'll explain what I mean by Humanism. I follow the American Humanist Association and the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard (see also, both are generally committed to social justice issues.

I've spent the last several years sincerely hoping for a sea change in the atheist community (and running a campus group to try to help it happen). I had hoped that the Humanist movement, somehow.

The arguments I've heard are:
1. Humanists can be theist. (Just not accurate-- at least
2. Humanists can be asshats, and it certainly isn't consistent with any rigorous definition of Humanism I've seen.)
3. It's necessary to say the word ""Atheist"" a lot so people hear it. (I don't like the word-- It's so negative. I'd rather focus on what we do believe

The major difference, mostly, with chaplains. I mean providing space, physical space, for people to come together on a weekly basis and talk about bringing our values into our everyday lives. Providing support systems for coping with loss and celebrating success. Providing celebrants to formalize births, marriages, deaths, contemplation, symbols, with no formalized support system. I found it quite difficult

Where does Atheism+ stand on criticism vs. replacing negative structures with positive ones?

So I've been thinking of the culture of self pity. Well it's been kinda forced on me. So really
.
So recently I've lost a few IRL friends over this Chick-Fil-A thing. Well it's not really about Chick-Fil-A

Over the last few weeks I've been in a whirlstorm of a lot of people around me (IRL) defending that chicken joint. I'm sure you've all seen the arguments that come out of this, including myself.
Now I'm sure some of you are ready to attack me for being American-centric. Look, I'm sure your country has no history of anti-GSM rhetoric fueled/caused by religion. Yes, anti-GSM violence and sentiment only exists in America. It's not like there's gangs of Christians going out to murder homosexuals in Africa right now, because some white American pastor told them about the horrible sin of homosexuality and that's all they needed to hear to start killing. Eastern European countries don't have a notable religious population, and even if they did they don't have any history of anti-gay violence. It's not like Moscow police break up gay pride parades because it was deemed ""Satanic."" Latin America is just a wonderland for openly GSM people. Not a single religious demonstration against GSM folk to be thought of. Religious hatred for queers begins and ends at USA's borders, and since you don't live here you have no reason to care.
First off

So then comes Chick-Fil-A. A guy says that since he has Christian values, not hate people, disagree with homosexuality. And according to a lot of people, disagreeing with homosexuality isn't bigotry. It's just his view, and it's ""just as bad"" for me to call him out for it. Now if this was just one guy saying it, I wouldn't be so pissed. But the fact is, people all around him are tripping over each other rushing to defend this Christian bigot. ""Oh I'm not letting these PC queers stopping me from getting my chicken!"" ""It's his right to say those things! Freedom of speech!"" But almost worse than the hatred is that these bigots expect a pity party for them. I had somebody who I personally considered a friend complain about how he wonders if he'll ever be able to believe that marriage is only for a woman and a man without being called homophobic. He went on to post links about ""homosexual culture and agenda"" and the threat we pose to society. And of course, and oh how the masses swooned about how brave they were. Conservatives mocked gays for ""being surprised"" that he's anti-gay, I say nothing. I can't. I don't say anything, that placement? A Mormon run institution where the people who were paid to bring me out of my depression constantly made violent gay jokes. That preached about how homosexuality is a choice and to be one you are just acting out on your depression. That your depression can be cured by just not being gay. That to graduate from the program you needed to renounce atheism and homosexuality to find God. You want to know the funny part? My story isn't rare. If I asked you the name of that one GSM youth who was bullyed to the point of suicide by Christians

Whenever I bring this up, you have no idea how privileged you are. Like every other majority group, society can't do enough to pander to you. You're blissfully unaware of how much society has made you the norm. You'll never not be represented. You'll never be marginalized. You mention your religion and you are automatically trusted by most people. You'll never be fired because of your religion/lack of religion. Remember when people were outraged because Obama might have been a Muslim? Remember how the War on Terror was started because God told Bush to? Remember when government funds went to religious schools, and the support for that suddenly dropped when they found out that it went to (GASP!) ISLAMIC schools? Do you think that shit would have flown if you didn't dominate the power structure? The worst oppression you'll ever face being reminded of my own oppression. You are so used to having everything being made to pander to you, the slightest infraction makes you think you know just what it's like to be the other. If being reminded of what your religion means to a lot of people bugs you, you might want to go to a more Christian positive space. May I suggest ""almost anywhere else?"" Because if you've never been to almost anywhere else, it's really pro-Christian. You'll find that in almost anywhere else, but you'll manage.

Oh sorry

Christian bars get shut down and run out of town because of concerned GSM groups.

Every politician with a serious campaign for president this year is queer

If any Christian appears on a TV show

Christian public figures have to hide their Christianity for years

Christian rights groups get death threats from GSM folk

When Christians get bullied at school

I should say that if you are Christian and your response to this isn't defensive anger, I'm on your side. But if your response is still defensive anger, I'm not going to coddle you, and I'm not sorry for my stance.

It's not just a Christian thing. Far from it. It's all of the ruling groups. It's the white people who honestly think cracker is comparable to insert racial slur in offense. It's white people who ignore why The Black Panthers were created and focus on their ""reverse racism."" It's white people who are outraged that they don't have a White Entertainment Television or White History Month. It's white people who see nothing wrong with just mentioning that Romney is an Anglo Saxon. It's the men who get offended at anti-rape campaigns for only focusing on men because women can be rapists too. It's men who call women ""misandrist"" for being on guard for rape instead of being outraged at the fact that there's enough rape in the world that women need to be on guard. It's men It's straight people who say heterophobic without any irony. It's straight people who think that ""that's so gay"" and related phrases aren't offensive because nobody attaches sexuality to the term anymore. It's cis queer people who say that trans people are too weird and just hinder their civil rights. It's cis people that say they ""have no problem"" with trans people as long as they don't hit on them because ew. It's able-bodied people complaining about disabled parking spaces or defending their right to say ""lame."" It's Americans who have no idea why other countries would hate us. It's Americans who want the attempted genocide of the Native Americans taken out of schools because it might make some kids unpatriotic. It's (mostly white) Americans who called Chris Rock a racist for his 4th of July tweet. It's the Americans who hate Obama for ""apologizing"" to other countries instead of being a cowboy and pew pew pew. It's the upper class that calls any economic policy that doesn't benefit nobody but them socialism. It's the upper class' welfare queen fantasy. It's the upper class' idea that the poor have it made. It's not just the people who believe these things, and most importantly ""I'M NOT LIKE THAT!""

And yes, I don't need to go into Intersectionality 101.

And most of all, it's not about you or your comfort. So really, I do not care about your self-pity.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/11h43z/something_i_wrote_for_srsd_a_while_ago_why_i_dont/

The reasons given tend to vary for transwomen and transmen.  For both

I find this rationale frustrating and othering.


First, it's not universal.  


When we present surgery as the holy grail of transition, and some do not.


We reinforce the rationale behind discriminatory laws that make surgery a requirement of changing gender markers, which will marginalize those whose reasons for forgoing surgery are related to personal comfort with their bodies as currently assembled.  Some of us don't have a desire to alter our bodies, and the validity of our gender identities should not hinge upon that desire, or lack thereof.

When we say that FTM bottom surgery options are sub-par, but not to (trans)women.


I see many trans activists and allies use cost or outcome to argue against surgery as a pre-requisite for gender marker change.  I'm asking that, we consider whether we're doing more harm than good with this line of reasoning.

My thanks go out to the people who've added their suggestions so far (emptyell, tekanji) for their efforts.

*Thus begins the list of things to avoid:*
___

**Number 1:** Asserting with certainty things that are open to question.

**Number 2:** Responding to objections to these assertions with mere repetitions and/or restatements without giving consideration to the objections (and no

**Number 3:** Outright dismissal of provided evidence. Demands for more evidence that fits whatever magical conditions they have in mind that's 'good enough' for their hyperskepticism.

**Number 4:** A refusal to explicitly state what you would deem acceptable evidence. 

**Number 5:** Demanding that others spend time educating you when a half hour on Wikipedia will do the job just as well.

`[Ed Note: If you're going to tell someone to go away and do some reading before coming back

**Number 6:** Any variation on ""You're wrong because I'm right!"" or ""My way or the highway."" Note that ""You're wrong because of x, but you have to back yourself up with why they're wrong.

**Number 6a:** Refusing to even entertain the possibility that other people's take on a situation may be valid and that there is not necessarily ONLY ONE valid way to tackle a problem/view an issue.

**Number 7:** When multiple people are saying that there is something seriously wrong with your point (or even just how you're presenting your point), even IF you're right, others CAN ALSO be right. Not everything is a binary 1 or 0/yes or no/right or wrong type situation.

Just as a personal aside, it is often less productive to double down on your point (because I'm RIGHT and they're WRONG!) and instead to do things like ask questions and try to understand why they're taking the position they do. Not only does this allow you to better tailor your arguments to them (instead of just doing the equivalent of shouting I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG WRONG WRONG), but it also leaves open the possibility to find out that there were things that they were ""right"" about.

Obviously ""fair"" doesn't mean ""must listen to anyone who spouts any kind of bullshit no matter what"". When it's an argument you've heard over and over and over and over and over again, depending on the person/situation, it can be useful), because I've heard every argument under the sun. So if/when I decide to engage, it's not a ""right or fair"" deal, but rather a ""do I want to make a point for the lurkers or try and get this person to understand where I'm coming from?"" decision.

**Number 8:** Do not assume that your argument is ""objective"". Recognize that you are a human being who brings your own biases into a conversation and even when your argument is supported by facts that does not mean that it is objective. Facts can be objective; the conclusions that we draw for them can't be.

**Number 8a:** ""Objective"" is not another way of saying ""correct"" and ""subjective"" is not another way of saying ""incorrect"". It is probably most helpful to look at ""objective"" as observations that are value neutral (""water is wet"") and ""subjective"" as the conclusions we draw from our observations (""water should be a basic right because people will die without it"").

**Number 9:** Don't use claims of ""logic"" or ""reason"" to shield yourself from criticism. Just because YOU think that your argument is ""logical"" or ""reasonable"" (or

**Number 10:** Coming to a thread with the attitude (stated or implied) that you will be attacked by the mean forum goers is toxic to productive discussion. It is also a pretty common trolling tactic, and then jumps in with ""SEE, JUST LIKE I PREDICTED!"" when they are called out by the community and/or banned. They use this to justify their original position on the community, and will sometimes point to the thread as ""evidence"" while commiserating with their buddies about how horribly they were treated.

**Number 11:** Communication involves two people. This means that what you intend to say is not always what you end up actually saying to the person or people listening to you. When you're told that you're coming across in a certain way

**Number 12:** Do not hide behind vague

I have seen two cases of this, just bloviating about how there's so many liberals here and will the poor conservative be accepted. In the latter case, the defender of conservatism was forced to create a fairy-tale construction of history just to defend the basic conservative ideology, and paid absolutely no mind to how conservative politicians have always been against any form of social justice where specific issues are concerned; they've just ""moderated"" their language as their privileges have been eroded.

**Number 13:** You are more likely to have positive interactions with people if you learn the standards and conventions of the community before posting, try to see what kinds of words/phrases get positive responses versus which ones get negative responses.

The basic idea is: Think of the forums as a dinner party. When you go to a dinner party it's with the expectation that you will be respectful to your host(s) and their guests. Coming to the party with a bad attitude, or shitting all over the house (even if you're being perfectly polite to everyone!) are all things that will get you thrown out of a party. If you wouldn't do them there, don't do them here.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10agwk/how_to_avoid_arguing_in_bad_faith/

2. Support the definitions of ""Sexual Orientation"" and ""Relationship Status"", bisexual, and questioning people. 
3. Recommend using the 2012 Tasmanian definition of ""Gender Identity"" (which is inclusive of Gender Expression/Presentation) 
4. Recommend the inclusion of ""Intersex"" as a protected attribute
5. Support the prohibition on discrimination for Commonwealth-funded aged-care services administered by faith based organisations 
6. Recommend all Government funded services are restricted from discriminating
7. Recommend faith based organisations
8. Recommend faith based organisations wishing to discriminate must publish a statement in position descriptions
9. Recommend that the position of Commissioner responsible for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity discrimination be established in the legislation.

I bring this up because I think the Innocence Project would greatly benefit from support from the Skeptic community. These two cases are far from isolated incidents. Thousands of people across the country are put away on bad eyewitness testimony and coercive interrogation techniques.

I do identify with feminism, and a number of other political, social, and scientific philosophies. What I can't seem to do, despite reading various posts and whatnot for the last days/weeks, is understand *what in the world atheism has to do with any of those other social movements*?

All of the social issues we are currently discussing as a society: religion, political influence, economics, etc.; do not seem to me to be *founded* in any way, shape, or form, on atheism. They do obviously have some connections: skepticism, progressiveism

Here's the text from the sidebar:

&gt; Atheism plus we support women’s rights.
&gt; Atheism plus we protest racism.

&gt; Atheism plus we use critical thinking and skepticism.

I care about social justice, homophobia, and transphobia, and I am a critical thinking skeptic. I am also an atheist.

1347067994.0,zjbib,What led you to atheism?,dancingwiththestars,47,31,25,"I thought it'd be nice to start an open thread where we can discuss the ways and reasons we became atheists.

My story: I've been an atheist for 5 years now. I was raised Catholic and attended Catholic school for 12 years. I bought into everything, and sinker. I was actually pretty religious in high school. In college I took a class on World Wars I and II. Reading primary source documents of soldiers and their loved ones writing letters to each other on all sides, I couldn't help but note how each side was absolutely sure that God was on *their* side. It set the wheels turning. It was essentially a combination of no longer being subjected to Catholic doctrine on a daily basis and being exposed to other viewpoints and cultures that completely eroded my beliefs over a matter of months. I studied abroad, I was in college, I was reading and actively seeking more knowledge. More more more.

One day my partner gave me The God Delusion and so I read it. I didn't consider myself ""atheist"" before it

I've been following PZ Myers and lots of other blogs (like Jen's and Skepchick) that would eventually become FtB pretty much since I realized I was an atheist. Fast forward several years....I see the ramp up of misogyny in the community. I see how hateful so very many atheists are. And I can't lie...I am extremely discouraged. I had thought I had found a community of people who espoused a better way of thinking, just as racist, just as homophobic, just as awful as we accuse our ""enemies"" of..apparently knowing that this is the one chance they get at living a meaningful life and making positive contributions to others isn't enough to keep people from resorting to base tribalism.

And then A+ came along. Just when I thought I was giving up on the atheist community...I knew I had a home again.

And that is the extremely condensed version of my journey! :p

&gt;I learned through my research that there is a vast and largely forgotten tradition of blue collar atheism in America, the freethought movement was linked to the working men’s movement of the early 1800s, which was a progenitor of the trade union movement. In the West it flourished among miners and other low-paid working people who were drawn to the Wobblies and other unions at the early part of this century.
 Everywhere you found freethinkers, who were in involved in things like unions and other struggles. These were by and large poor people whose distrust of priests and ministers was part and parcel of their hatred of bosses and bankers. Their ethos was, put very briefly: think for yourself, because those who offer to do your thinking for you are usually planning to get hold of your wallet. That is a very clear- headed kind of skepticism.

It’s cartoonishly pro forma when white folk, anti-sexist and anti-heterosexist because one, we say so, and, two, hierarchy is something only those knuckle-dragging supernaturalists do.

**GENERAL PRINICPLES OF RACE/FEMINISM INTERSECTION**
&gt;""[Nothing about us without us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_About_Us_Without_Us)."" Don't act without any input from the group in question. 

&gt;Ethnic and cultural intersection with women's rights means that the exact same issues are *experienced in a different, but can't remember where. If anyone has a link I will add it).

&gt;*Always* assume that most of the people from a different culture/race/ethnicity know more about that group than you do. Even better, you must accept that some of the difference may be cultural, and *permanently* lost in translation.

&gt;Show solidarity. If someone you are allied with does something wrong to another marginalised group

Feminists have no excuse to be unaware of these rules

**THE FACTS:**

&gt;1) Amina Tyler, and is not the source of anyone's honor"" written across her chest.

&gt;2) Various Islamic clerics said she should be punished. For example cleric Almi Adel, with eighty to a hundred lashes, but [because of] the severity of the act she has committed, she deserves be stoned to death.

&gt;3) Femen lauched a show of solidarity with Amina

&gt;4) Some of these [were racist](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18jpc9i1c1laajpg/ku-xlarge.jpg). There are numerous other examples.

&gt;5) There has been a large pushback from Mulsim women in the protest ""Muslimah Pride"". Many complained about the racism

&gt;6) There has been pushback from intersectional [western feminists](http://jezebel.com/5993775/muslim-women-shockingly-not-grateful-for-topless-european-ladies-trying-to-save-them) too.

So

&gt;1) Totally right. Tunisian feminist protests for feminist issue.

&gt;2) Totally wrong. Everyone who supports social justice has common ground here.

&gt;3) Mostly right. The organisation Amina is a part of is doing what she did as a sign of solidarity. They are *supporting a member of that ethnic and cultural group in the way she utilised herself*.

&gt;""Mostly"" because Femen has form doing the exact same thing without middle-eastern members input

&gt;4) Totally wrong. This in not what [Amina wanted](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/mideast-feminists-against-femen_n_3052175.html?utm_hp_ref=world). Nor is it acceptable to be this racist in any context

&gt;5) Some mix of right and wrong. Certainly there are multiple perspectives and multiple complaints

&gt;6) Some mix of right and wrong. No-one denies that cultural relativism can be taken to extremes

So considering all this, support those who show solidarity in the way she wanted, reject racism and hold a nuanced position on the pushback, which both supports the above but hears and doesn't conflate the varied disagreement from people directly involved in the issue."" 

This is a really generic response

**THE RESPONSE AT FTB**

I am going to focus entirely on Freethought Blogs as emblematic of modern SJ/atheist ideas in respect to Islam. FTB is a place where intersectional approaches are the norm

I am focussing on a few white bloggers. They are the allies here, [Maryam Namazie](http://freethoughtblogs.com/maryamnamazie/2013/04/05/our-day-defend-amina/) and [No Country for Women](http://freethoughtblogs.com/taslima/2013/03/29/women-should-know-that-their-body-belongs-to-them/).

Also for a good background approach to how race and culture interact with social justice movements

**PZ**

PZ writes on Amina specifically [once](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/04/free-amina/) and does well enough. He links to Maryam Nemazie's blog, all the while ignoring the racism that was prevalent in the protests. Which is relevant to the discussion he was having. He breaks the last rule of allyship - don't elide racism from a relevant discussion. Say it first and say it loud.

He also becomes perpetrator, indeed only around [20% of Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim#Demographics) live in the Middle East). More importantly, Islam is conflated with a more sinister thought ... ""not white"" (also wrong, there are more Christians in Africa, Asia and South America than *the entire population of Europe and North America combined*). And we all know what ""not white"" people get called ... primitive and barbaric.

We all *know* that our media feeds us a horrendously biased picture of Islam, unrelated to religious belief'"" and the Islam section also says the practice "" is mainly derived from culture"". Yet who do we associate the ""barbaric"" practice with? Surprise surprise, the religion thought of as ""not white"".

Also note that is just Christianity. You do not need to go far to find near limitless tales of all other world religions and horrific crimes. Only discussing Islamic crimes over and over is a good way to generate cognitive bias.

**OPHELIA**

Since the Amina story hit the internet

Literally, race and Islam are conflated by almost everyone), it is her damn responsibility to make clear that racism is not acceptable.

To be sure, and requires visibility.

She then goes on to [mock claims of racism by Muslims](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/muslimah-pride/#more-7592) and goes out of her way to [deny intersectionality in general](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/attempting-to-impose-white-western-feminism/). She has this awesomely dissonant position - 
&gt;""We don’t (listen to all Muslims). We just choose a particular set we want to listen to and then refer to them as “Muslims” and what we’re doing as “listening to Muslims” so that everyone will think we have our finger on the pulse of “the Muslim community.” It’s all bullshit. This particular person was listening to some Muslims who dislike Femen and the protest about Amina’s arrest or kidnapping

As opposed to writing multiple pieces characterising the counter-protesters are brainwashed misogyny apologists
&gt;""It seemed that many other Muslim women across the world agreed with my stance and what followed was a defiant and vocal rejection of Femen’s invitation. Instead of ‘getting naked’ Muslim women from across the world tweeted and uploaded pictures of themselves to Facebook in their hijabs

Assuming she read that

This is the nuance I was talking about above. Ophelia is doing exactly what she describes

Every oppressed group gets this. Feminism is ""a bad word"" in most settings for example

To pretend Islam is a set of rules that starts and stops with [Sharia](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/are-sharia-councils-harming-women/) and [FGM](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/they-tell-you-that-youre-dirty/) is wrong. Those are just a couple of topics she happened to write about during the period of this debate. Unrelated of course. Also unrelated is that she never chose to write about [Islamic Feminism and Islamic Secularism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nNSz0rHWRo) (long video link). [Islamic feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_feminism) has a long and significant history. I particularly like the quote
&gt;""When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah

In many ways Islam was ahead of the west. It is not even unreasonable to suggest that wealthy white women could have seen the relatively better position of women in some parts of the world when western feminism and suffrage began to foment. 

Further down that page is a discussion on current issues for *Islamic women/feminists*. There is no question that Islamic feminists exist, thoughtful women's rights activists who have considered Islam *from the inside* and find it compatible with feminism.

But it is just dismissed

Then Ophelia denies that ""white western feminism"" is [even a thing](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/attempting-to-impose-white-western-feminism/) or that feminism is at all altered by a cultural or racial lens. Ophelia

Ophelia ticks all the boxes for bad ally. Silencing

**TESTOSTERONE**

The biological reason given for inherent difference ([sexual dimorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism)) is usually testosterone. Why testosterone? Studies have shown in vitro (test tube) effects where testosterone increases muscle dimensions and strength and so on.  Population level common sense shows men are stronger

This is the favoured hypothesis to the point that the Olympics Committee and IAAF can now decide who ""can participate as a woman"" by [testing these levels](http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2012-06-22-IOC-Regulations-on-Female-Hyperandrogenism-eng.pdf) and even actively seeking out women athletes to run these tests on.

So

[Nup](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/fivering_circus/2012/07/olympics_sex_test_the_international_olympic_committee_has_a_way_to_test_whether_athletes_are_men_or_women_is_it_fair_.html). 5% of women elite athletes have ""male"" levels of testosterone. 6% of male elite athletes have ""female"" levels of testosterone (unpublished data by IOC). 

An overlapping range shows

Even more so

Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are [over-represented in elite sport](http://www.academia.edu/1264578/The_Science_of_Sex_Verification_and_Athletic_Performance). They have no response to testosterone at all

And testosterone levels in [a recent study](http://jap.physiology.org/content/112/11/1805.abstract) did not predict muscle growth post exercise! Women and men created the same amount of new muscle fibre post-exercise

So

But that doesn't mean the sexual dimorphism argument is bogus, to cause a real significant difference that is inherent and insurmountable.

**ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR DIFFERENCE**

Let's return to the weightlifting. Women are as good as men were in the 70s. Both male and female weightlifters have improved. What has changed?

1. Participation

2. Training methods

3. ????

*Note that biology hasn't changed. So any answer that includes ""biology is the sole determinant of sporting achievement"" is wrong.*

If it is the training methods

Well

The graphic can be divided where the blue bars end

And yes

In the field events it is harder to compare because women didn't get to do a fair few of them in 1968. If we only look at comparable events women advanced their winning time/distance just over 4%

And yes

So women are gaining significantly faster

So, women were excluded for a long time. 

A bigger pool of potential athletes means a statistical outlier of amazing talent is more likely to arise. And there are probably genetic explanations for some of these outliers

Some people will argue a range of things to deny the main point here

**TROPES VS SCIENCE**

But guess what? This shit has never been studied. Despite the big bucks in sport and training science

For more discussion on gender distortions affecting ""what gets researched"" see the [Rationally Speaking podcast](http://www.rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs77-victoria-pitts-taylor-on-feminism-and-science.html). Skeptics favourite

**TL:DR** 

Women are catching up to men in elite sport records

Scientists have pretty much based all research on gender differences in sport around a flawed hypothesis. As we see in many fields of science

Is there a gender differences that means something in real world sport? Who knows. The evidence doesn't exist.

All we know is that all the data points to convergence in sporting achievement at the top level. We have no evidence to suggest this trend will stop. As skeptics and scientists

Hello gentlemen (and the occasional lady).

This will be an exercise in perspective-taking

You're here today presumably because you think A+ is a stupid idea. You, as I have done elsewhere, that this is not our intention. We agree that you can be an upstanding citizen, an excellent member of your community, and a positive force for good in the world without wearing that label. We agree that you can be vehemently opposed to sexism without subscribing to this subreddit and without calling yourself a member. None of that is in question.

Similarly, homophobic, transphobic, and unskeptical behavior in the atheism movement. We all agree that most people do not engage in most of these behaviors most of the time, so there is little point in making the painfully trivial observation that ""not everyone is like that.""

Another common observation seems to be that ""Atheism+ is divisive."" To this crowd

I'm referring to this picture.  This kind of apology is absolute bullshit.

Here's some problems from what I can gather.

1.  This person thinks they can apologize for all of Christianity as if that will negate the net effect it has had on all of history.

2.  This person still refuses to own their Christian history by putting in quotations ""Christians"" who happen to be hateful bigots and in doing so

3.  This person refuses to talk to people as people and instead uses a Christian filter.  Look at how this person attempts to Christsplain to everyone as to how they REALLY are.  So therefore

4.  This person doesn't really care.  The explanations they are offering is more for them to absolve their sense of guilt from not having the courage to walk away from a destructive institution than it is to really try to establish a meaningful truce with non-believers and believers.

I've seen this kind of apologetics time and time again and I just do not think this is even remotely good enough.  I don't think I'm alone in saying that we don't typically want just some apologies for a day or so,,False,self,t5_2ut2g,False,,True

[Hans Rosling](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) is the brain and face of Gapminder

But for us it means we have a ton of data at our fingertips.

For example

In the setting of the recent discussions about Islam

The top about ten countries are Christian (even the 2 white bubbles as per Wikipedia). The highest Islamic country is at number 15 if I counted right. The entire top 30 contains about 5 Muslim majority countries.

The other thing to notice is that there is a strong trend between murder of women and poverty. A few outliers to be sure

The same relationship between religion and **general murder rate** holds [in general](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=tBrbR3BlR_12WlTIlSTpu6g;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tZgPgT_sx3VdAuyDxEzenYA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=98$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=131$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) although the poverty correlation is weak.

Of course

**Fertility rates** [are relatively evenly spread](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) by religion and directly correlate to poverty levels

I remember some talk recently of Islam in some areas being against **vaccination** (well

Female foeticide is a big problem in highly patriarchal societies

Of course

Also surprisingly

**Whether women work** [does show a significant difference](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=)

1363159682.0,1a7d2z,Comment on /r/technology about PETA and tactical oppression,rumblestiltsken,20,12,1,"So

[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1a593e/peta_goes_after_assassins_creed_for_its_depiction/c8ubwlg) in the tech sub has my mind somewhat blown. I can see the truth of it.

&gt;Folks underestimate PETA. Almost ten years ago (I think?), PETA had just started a campaign where they suggested that people should drink beer instead of milk. MADD was up in arms. A media frenzy ensued. PETA and MADD went on multiple TV news shows and debated fervently. MADD talked about the woes of drunk driving, and PETA talked about the woes of drinking milk.

&gt;Here's the kicker: before their scuffle with MADD, when MADD came along, I remember one of the heads of PR saying how thrilled she was. On the one hand, MADD could talk about the woes of drunk driving--all fine and good--and PETA could agree with MADD's concerns. On the other hand, PETA could make statements that would otherwise be objectionable in a debate--that milk causes disease, for example--and MADD wouldn't object to the premise or present the counter-argument; they'd just go back to espousing their talking own points. In other words, PETA and MADD got airtime to express their ideas

&gt;I've seen this PR tactic over and over. Like clockwork. When PETA compared animal domestication to the suffering endured in the holocaust, as controversial as the stance was, PETA was able to successfully get unchecked quality national airtime--airtime where they could critique factory farming without having to debate directly with a representative of the farming industry.

&gt;The general formula here is: 1) find someone to insult who is not directly in opposition with your message, we take offense to the tactical approach they took on y."" 4.) Appear on TV or on the web to discuss the contention, and voice your opinion with minimal critical response.

&gt;In the case of Ubisoft, they may hate PETA fervently but they now know that one of their favorite gaming companies finds whaling to be otherwise detestable. And, though PETA may be mistaken for thinking such, they will likely chalk that up to a win.

If anything this is making me hate PETA all over again. I always just saw it as controversy-generating tactics to get airtime

In this case

When dealing with many issues of misogyny in religion, and assigned gender as synonyms.

The problem I have is that the sort of religions I talk about do the same. If I attempt to differentiate, and I completely ruin any chance of a religious agreement, for another. 

As an example, and motherhood with uteri and so forth, it would be hard for me to acknowledge that not all women have such capacities nor are all those with such capacities women. I also feel like that would kind of distract from the fact that traditional Catholicism despises pregnancy and women because they believe them to necessarily coexist- which is the main problem. 

So would it be appropriate for me to just avoid correct pronouns? Should I instead try for trans-inclusivity? Is there anything I can do to avoid confusion

1. Anger over Muhammad cartoon or this film are really the tip of the iceberg here.  The regional anger is at least equally due to a much less whitewashed daily news about the daily results of US aggression in the region.  From two Iraqi Wars, the asymmetry of the plight of Palestinians verses a US supported Israel, and the list goes on and on.  How many Muslims have been killed by US/western forces, actions and US supported governments in the region in the last 25 years? 100,000? 500,000? The US government hardly comes across as a force of a good for Muslims in the region.

2. Their lack of a real understanding of liberal democracies and free speech. People of the region equate all media originating in the US as either being condoned and created by their government because this is how the region's governments have worked for generations.

3. Their bias and misinformation.  Just like we have biases in our journalism and reporting about both sides of our conflicts and issues,,False,self,t5_2ut2g,False,,True

They might be interesting for some
but could start a conversation.

At the start my conceptualization has an odd break.
Many atheists say they don't believe in God
but for me the idea of God is so totally maleformed
even that isn't possible.
The concept of divinity is pernicous garbage.
It isn't that I don't believe God exists
but rather that the whole idea is utter nonsense.
It makes no sense to say God does or does not exist
because the word God doesn't really refer to anything.

This may seem like a little detail that could be ignored
but atheists get dragged into debates
over God this and God that and so on
and none of that has any meaning at all.
Every such argument can only cater to the childish.

But then comes the obligation to work with the world
and the people in it on their own terms
and it so happens that the nature of consciousness
causes us to naturally project agency onto everything.
From phenomena to objects to the world as a whole
every possible thing is seen as having the same trappings:
desires, and so on.
From that mechanism emerges not only divinity
but angels, and all the rest.
So there is a chasm of sorts--a great distance that looms.
And out of this chasm waft all kinds of questions.
How even to measure the distance and terrain?
Stay safely on the proper side?
Chip away at the great edifice upon which others base their lives?
Perhaps build a bridge or establish some other crossing?

Early on it seemed atheism itself was the answer
and the task was propagation of truth.
But now that is less certain.
Careful investigation of popular beliefs reveals
the supernatural retains pervasive influence.
In America the open market for religion
fills churches large and small
but in Europe and Asia where the secular dominates
close examination reveals all the same tendencies
held close and personal in closed religious markets.
So it seems the spiritual can fit in a range of ways.
Animism gives way to monotheism gives way to spirituality
but true atheism is always a rarely taken path.
Crafting a righteous peace with ordinary beliefs
is no simple task for an atheist.
There needs to be a way of expressing acceptance
of the human tendancies of others
while at the same time understanding
that all such ideas are not only junk
but contaminants that threaten all reason.
