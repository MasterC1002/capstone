Want to live in a trailer in city limits?  Illegal.  Can't do so on your own land

Want to have your own power?  Illegal.  All houses within city limits must attach to the grid.  Pay $20k for a meter and drop

Want to have a humanure composting system?  Illegal.  You need to pay $10k in order to have an inspected septic system with a leach field that flushes all that nitrogen into the nearest river instead

Want to collect your own water

The perspective right now on this is ""do it under the radar, hide in someone else's backyard, etc.  All of these carry the risk of fines, house confiscation / destruction, and jail if some bureaucrat toady has a bad day.

The focus of /r/tinyhouses **must** be first on changing local laws and finding which locales have laws amenable to tiny houses

IMHO

**Reposting my comment here as THB has a history of deleting / not approving any posts that point out safety problems.**

Holy $DEITY.  This is bad bad bad.

""Also

Aiee!  Using metal studs for wiring without using the insulating bushings or MC-type wire required by HUD code?  Fire risk.  Shock risk given the metal studs.  This goes double as vibration from moving it on the road will wear through the duct tape in no time.  If the metal studs are not completing a circuit back to the ground at the breaker box

Secondly

Third

Lastly

I don't think I've seen a single owner-built tiny house without at least one glaring safety oversight.  The fact that I was able to find this many in just a few pictures means that there are certainly many more.

If you don't know about wind loading, etc., then don't think that you can save money by figuring this stuff out on the fly!  Get a pro to install your cute wood stove or electric, and get an engineer to look at your structure.  Yes, you'll pay more for it, but you are still saving money by building tiny!

I like the overall look of the house however.

They're out of Spring

Can't say I'm a fan of the faux brick exterior and I don't like the placement of the AC unit.  But hey

Nice kitchen counter space but I'd want a double sink and I'd want to lose one of the kitchen windows and put up some cabinets.

And it comes with solar! But not the batteries.  I don't see many coming with solar already installed

Would like to see the side walls go a little higher before the roof slope for some more headroom in the loft - every inch probably makes a huge difference.

1368946931.0,1emcx6,Let me address some of your questions...,DrObotnik,65,6,14,"I've noticed a lot of the same questions/themes/misconceptions on /r/tinyhouses and felt I could shed some light on them for you.

* 1)  The most popular topic is the issue of finding a place to permanently park a tiny home built on a trailer. And everyone answers in the same (correct) way: you have to check local building ordinances to see where in a municipality you can park it

Now, you can build tiny onsite, getting a permit and then going through all required inspections.  This is something I don't get--the IRC Res. Code clearly defines that you need a kitchen, bath, and 120sf of living space/person for a house.  The code book literally tells you exactly how small you can build your house (and it's damn small).  That brings me to the next point...

* 2)  The second most popular topic is how municipal codes discriminate against poor people and inspectors don't want you to build.  

Nowhere in the IRC Res. Code does it state that you have to use standard construction materials for your home and spend a lot of money. The code book gives specifications for, codes inspectors are very wonderful people (because they are just people!), and they like working *with* builders on unique projects.  It's also their *job* to tell you how to use different materials appropriately.  Here's a tip: you can use license plates as roofing shingles--just ask first!

* 3)  Another popular topic is the idea that it would be great to live together in a community and somehow share the land

What you're thinking of is a housing cooperative, which can then borrow money (from a credit union, another form of cooperative) to purchase property.  You can then apply for a rezoning application for your property, set your own rules for determining waste management, grid access, home size, and even materials (like an HOA).

It's amazing that no one comes to this conclusion

* 4)  I also keep hearing how we have to band together against the status quo--which typically translates to standing up to bureaucratic nonsense. 

This is like saying, I'm having a hard time getting a solid comparison.

The key is to actually *compete* in the very arena you're trying to change (now I have a good comparison for this): it's like politics, you go register to run for public office and then you find your supporters to vote you in.  If you want to compete against traditional suburban and urban developers (because that's who you're fighting, not municipalities or codes), you have to become the developer who does the unconventional.  Because all that bureaucratic nonsense is just a paper game--you can do anything you want as long as, on paper, you've met all the requirements.  

I wrote my culminating university project on exactly this topic: cooperative housing economies, then read between them.

1340210311.0,vc2he,Work Exchange- live and work in my tiny house/cabin just outside of Yellowstone ,lumpytrout,62,7,37,"Hello Tiny House fans
So I am offering a work trade for free rent in our rustic but fully furnished two bedroom cabin all utilities included.  This includes firewood, giving you lots of time to enjoy the area and pursue other interests and try out the tiny house lifestyle.  The cabin will be available from late August 2012 through June 2013.
**What we offer:** [I’ve put together a tumblr page with photos of the farm and cabin](http://millersbottom.tumblr.com/) (affectionately known as ‘the cabana’ it is the first photo on the page).  There has been a fair amount of work done on the exterior since these photos were taken but this should give you the general idea.  I’m working on getting some more interior photos now, [a new 80% efficient woodstove.](http://i.imgur.com/LkMob.jpg)  [The bathroom has a composting toilet and a bath made from a converted watering trough.](http://i.imgur.com/xZKCU.jpg)  Water is via a 55 gallon solar drum which is filled with non-potable water and water for cooking generally needs to be bought in town.  The town of [Gardiner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardiner,_Montana) is about 5 miles away and offers most of the basic other stuff you will need gas/groceries/laundry/wifi etc.  There are also several [world famous hot springs](http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=HGR211-031) nearby that offer year round soaking when you need it.  If you are interested in any type of outdoor activities from hiking and biking to kayaking and skiing this is clearly the motherland and the location is the best thing we have to offer.  There is enough room for two of you if this is something that a couple would be interested in.

**What we need:** We have a long list of tasks that we need help on but mostly general handyman/farm projects and carpentry .  Must have a general knowledge of power tools and tool safety and willingness to try new things.  Email is generally the easiest way to communicate so a laptop and digital camera are helpful.  Although we have other family that live on the farm that can help out in a pinch
 
**BONUS:** If any of this seems familiar
If you are interested, what your interests are and why this project interests you.  Your letter should include a timeline of when this would work for you, your skills and experience, how would this would work for you financially (money in savings, a job you can do from anywhere, will apply for jobs nearby etc) and whatever else you may need to make this happen (tools etc).  Please also include contact info for 3 references (they won’t be contacted unless you are a finalist and I will let you know before contacting anyone).

questions?  Fire away!

**edit** Deadline for applications is 6/28/12

**edit 2** good guy 1over6bil was kind enough to send us video tours of the [outside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzZIJpiFt0A&amp;feature=youtu.be) and the [inside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkwR28bSkWA&amp;feature=youtu.be) so please give him some upvotes.  As you can see from the videos most of the updating needs to happen on the inside, trim etc.

**edit 3** Thanks for your input everyone.  This opportunity is now closed.  We will be making a decision and getting in touch with candidates over the next week.

I've got an optimization question: how would you design the most efficient tiny house?",zippycorners,52,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/11hoqs/im_studying_to_be_an_engineer_but_architecture_is/, it's fairly easy to pick things that you want to optimize and design the perfect object. If you want a car with lots of horsepower

So anyway, and how you would go about designing that with respect to building codes or trailer codes?

The things that stick out to me right off the bat are:

* Open Space
* Storage Space

        * combine furniture with storage
* Water efficiency
* Electric efficiency
* Insulation efficiency

        * triple pane windows
        * vacuum insulated panels (VIP)
        * vacuum insulated glass windows
        * energy recovery ventilation
        * aerogel fabric
        * solatubes
        * solar domestic water heaters
        * 6"" exterior wall using two 2x2 with 2"" of rigid foam sandwiched between them
* Service runs efficiency (consolidate piping and wiring)
* Servicing efficiency (water

        * use natural light
        * grey-water system
* Task efficiency (to a point...not too high on my priorities)
* Acoustic efficiency (this one is actually pretty high on my priorities
* Sightlines (tall shelves vs. deep low cabinets vs. hidden nooks vs. huge open space)

Forgetting expenses (tiny houses are much cheaper than regular anyway)

EDIT: You know

Oh

EDIT 2: updated my list. Still not quite sure how I want to prioritize things, but...I get stuck pretty fast. 

When you don't have any SPECIFICS to optimize

**Edit 3: I'm really trying to boil this down to mathematics.** I know you can't practically approach everything mathematically, I'd welcome your input.

The bed took up most of the room space. As soon as you walk in the bed is to the right. Wall to the left. On the other side of the bed is a window with an air conditioner sticking out. Under the air conditioner is a building heater.
When I came into this room I quickly found I could get boxes that fit under the bed where I can place clothing. I also found there was some space to the side of the air conditioner and heater where I can place something.
At Walmart I bought something that looked like a clothes rack that fit in that space.
Now I was able to hang my nice clothing.
Under the rack I stored books and my laptop.

I did this optimization of space out of necessity
Although that seemed to work

One look inside

**Crammed**

I wish there was some way to hide the clothes rack, was actually a laundry rack and wasn't intended for long term heavy clothing. The plastic bar started to bend down after a while.

Some of the places I have seen here look very nice.
I wanted to see if there is some kind of formula to follow for a place to look good and be livable. Perhaps a minimum space is required?

The other obvious answer is to just have separate ladders that lead to each room, they're not great for young children, elderly people, pregnant women, disabled people, drunk people, or even just guests staying over who aren't used to them trying to use them in the middle of the night.

The only solution I can think of that uses stairs and keeps the rooms separate is to have stairs dividing the middle of the house

I am in the design stage of my tiny house.  It will feature a full marine grade solar system for 100% of electrical needs.

I see most people's tiny homes are heavily reliant on propane.  

Even with my solar running all electrical needs.... 

A propane heater
A propane on demand shower
A propane stove

Does not exactly make me off grid.  I dont want to be a hermit in the woods... But I don't want to rely so heavily on one energy source.

Thoughts? Ideas? Solutions?

Edit #1- seems like electric cooking is not an option as a 1500 watt draw is too much for a tiny house pv system.

-I like the idea of a backup Woodstove for heat and cooking.  I will also look into rocket stoves.  Either one must be safe and clean for a small space.

I've been doing a lot of research about tiny houses and have started to design my own tiny house (with google sketchup). I just started framing my roof

Now, so my question is what in the heck is supporting the walls against the outward force applied by the roof rafters?

I live in Canada and I'm sure my tiny roof would have to withstand some snow weight at some point. We also intend to insulate the roof

I've thought about doing the standard ceiling joists attached to the rafters

Collar ties won't work as I've read: 1) They can't be placed more than 1/3 the length of the rafter

Trusses won't work because they would also interfere with the loft space

I have considered using some sort of laminated beam as one would in a cathedral ceiling installation

So, but it's important for me to have a solid understanding before I continue planning. How can I support my tiny house from the outward force of the rafters without sacrificing loft space?

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: What is supporting the exterior walls from the outward force of the rafters in a tiny house? What can I do to support my walls without sacrificing loft space?

Would it be much better to find something to build your house in? Right now I'm thinking a silo or something like that that wouldnt cost much to get an old one.

Can you just outright build a house out of mud or something similar?

I will find a way but i know some people here will have useful info for me. I don't need a lot of space at all its just so I can live on my own (with my girlfriend) and I do what I want

Whats a good cheap and minimal general design? Like an A frame or something? One thing I was planning to do is have a geodesic dome

The main problem is finding a place to build. I could probably be small enough to get past building consent from experience and I would hope Its somewhere people wouldn't know/ care there is a small house there. I thought maybe I could ask people or people I know that have a lot of land they don't use all of if I could build there and in return do some work for them and make them stuff.

1351054970.0,11zpnd,Tiny House Communities: A Key Element Discussed To A Successful Tiny House Movement,TinyHouseResearch,36,7,30,"The concept of placement has been a persistent and ongoing dilemma to what I understand about the potential success of the Tiny House Movement. It occurs to me that there are five (maybe more) ways to place a Tiny House legally:

1. Land zoned without building restrictions. I know of land in the mountains of Oregon (Deschutes County) that is suitable for Tiny House placement (subject to city or community restrictions). Areas in remote locations may not have the attractive demographics that Tiny House residents want

2. Land zoned for campgrounds (but not necessarily RV's).

3. Land zoned for RV's (which may include campground use).

4. Land zoned for mobile homes

5. Residential land (rural or city) that allows for year-round occupation of a parked RV (aka Tiny House.) 

The ""best case scenario"" I can envision, or a trailer park and 'partner' with the owner to develop the land *exclusively* as  Tiny House Community. In my limited research (so far) I am finding that many people *want* to live in a community of other Tiny House people, possibly sharing resources like a community/rec center (that may include laundry facilities) within walking distance to a small general store, nature trails, and hopefully public transportation to a reasonably sized city. 

Questions:

1. Has anybody compiled a ""list"" of communities/cities that allow the year-round occupation of a Tiny House on single family residential lots?

2. Does anybody know anyone with land zoned for campground, or a Mobil Home Park that is not being utilized --OR-- does anyone have any suggestions about how to *find* such a person owning such land? (*A Realtor was my first thought on this, but I don't have the big bucks needed to buy such a location and the only way I can see a start-up finding success is to partner with a land owner. My assumption is that if someone has that kind of property for sale, then  more than likely they need the money and want to sell, not partner with a start-up. Also, I don't believe that a real estate agent will work to help find this kind of a deal since there wouldn't really be any commission involved...) 

3. Does anybody want to *work with me* in developing a business of creating Tiny House Communities? I *DO* believe there is a major market to be explored on the tiny house front (especially

Anyway:

1) If I were to get one of those tiny homes that you can hitch on to a truck

2) What's a good resource as far as creating and understanding a checklist of to-dos as far as knowing what you'd need in addition to your house, and laws of the sort. I'm only 20, I don't know much about how the world works yet, so I'm pretty naive as far as what I need to do to make something like this a reality.

3) how practical is it to have a small mobile house? Is it hard or expensive to move to scenic spots for vacation. Do you find that there's a lot of trouble that goes into living comfortably, fastening down, or strapping loose items in your house so they don't bounce, fall, or damage anything else; setting up pipes/wires/etc; or even finding it hard to take the home on certain roads or highways due to size/weight/etc.?

Forget the wedding and the ring and the cake and all that bullshit.  We just want to have a place that's our own

We've decided to build a house.  Something modest and something cost effective and here are our weighings:

1. Earthbag house: We've gotten the costs for this venture down to $16k including plumbing and zoning.  However

2. Tiny House: I really like some of the designs.  They're a little more expensive for not a whole lot of space BUT they appear to be pretty high quality and we could build it in a few weeks if we jammed.  If we invested $20k we would have a permanent and mobile home to possibly expand on.  If we got a plot of land we could also put a trailer on it or a shipping container and convert that and we could even possibly build the earthbag house later on and then use the tiny house as a guest house.

3. Get a trailer or shipping container for free and refurbish it.  We've looked on craigslist and have found a lot of people getting rid of their old

What do you think of these ideas?  Do you think it's possible to live in a tiny house with a child?  Do you think it's worth $20k to have a tiny house because it's quality and mobile?

Side Note 2: A tiny basement would be fun too with a floor trap door with a ladder down to the basement with a washer/dryer down there adding to the space to work with and functionality.

My trailer will be lightweight, and canvas, built atop two reclaimed wheelchair frames and wheels. The trailer will have four wheels - the front two on a bearing like a radio flyer wagon. Between the two axles there will be - hopefully - the chicken coop. Atop that will be a 5' x 8' platform that will be home to a covered-wagon-esque canvas hoop house which will be my living quarters and sleeping area. I am very experienced in living in small spaces - I have dwelled in wall tents for a substantial amount of time and own few possessions.

Here is a diagram: http://postimg.org/image/isy8ottrt/full/ and  http://postimg.org/image/42e7wagwt/
My hope is to have four or five bantam hens. I have considered several designs: one being to keep the chickens in a coop under my sleeping area and carrying portable fencing, but set in the grass throughout the daytime so the chickens can feed.

I think there are some big advantages to running a system like this. Notably, the flock of chickens reproducing, and have a solid system of caches of grains for sprouting and greening. It costs very little to design this. I'm going to end up spending about $200 total. No land costs - set up wherever is safest, wherever there's permission. So long as I'm kept well stocked with bike parts and inner tubes, I'm rolling.

I'm actually going to spend a year or so living in the trailer full-time. It's an experimental endeavor to figure out just how much food can be produced with very little money, as well as an experiment in just how small of a space a human can live in without going crazy.

Security and water are my two biggest concerns. I'm designing a charcoal sleeve filter for water, I'm going to have to use the advantages afforded by my mobility to put myself in positions where I'd be safest. My tires will be capable of handling some offroad trails - and I'll be sticking around in the boondocks anyway, of course. I'm also working out what arms I'm going to carry. Likely a bow/crossbow and a small-caliber black powder rifle. Last, in bad weather, I'm building in hooks on the sides of the unit to tie it down, and have a long-term goal of building a silnylon rainfly to cover the whole thing.

I can imagine it being a really special place for the kid to spend a lot of time in growing up--spend a few weeks out in nature over the summers, I think we'd be a two-home family.

I've been following the tiny house movement closely since I discovered it about a year ago.  I had always been interested in shipping container homes, and the coziness, I was sold.

Being out in the real world, when I would gladly pay for a smaller place that was well done.  I have lived on ships and boats so limited space doesn't bother me, but quality and comfort is what I was looking for.

Then being in the real world I came up against the issues of cost: tiny home owners being debt free

Mobility has also become something I see the value in more and more every day.  After my girlfriend's home was threatened by some major disasters

That mobility also brings freedom.  Want to live somewhere new?  It's relatively easy to pick up and go.

My complaint with them would be the sacrifices I have seen many such homes make

The entire thing is intended to fit on a utility trainer and have a 20 foot by 8 foot footprint.  One wall (with windows and skylights in the roof) is intended to face north

It's a wet bathroom, fold down counter space behind door, possible graywater toilet.  Shower head attached to overhead rafter; fan unit for removing odors and moisture in air.

Laundry room and wardrobe (4 feet by 7 feet) with stacked compact washer drier, get an outfit off the shelf and get dressed.

Both rooms' windows are 2ft wide by 1ft high at 5ft to 6ft above the level of the floor (for privacy from outside

The main room I drew out, microwave, and convection oven (for space saving).  A thin sink next to it.  Lots of shelf space over the kitchen and wrapping around to a set of high full wall bookshelves with a library ladder that also aids accessing the sleeping loft.  I am debating a built in desk next to the shelves, or possibly a folding design.  I'd also plan on a futon as a couch/guest sleeping and a kitchen island on wheels with storage underneath and leaves to become a dinner table.

Somehow living in a tiny one bedroom apartment is considered WAY better than living in a large RV.

The way people react makes me think ""Is this actually a bad idea?""  I mean

Or is it just so overwhelmingly trashy for someone to live in an RV with their baby that the stigma will drive me too nuts?  Or will people see it's not so bad and get over it?

It would be in the SF bay area. What sort of permits are needed for something like this? The largest structure would be 12x12. Does that fall into shed status territory? I would be on the grid

  
Any thoughts or advice?

* I'd like to keep it between $2, I'd also like to continue to add function to it in the future once it's built. I believe that I can make &amp; collect funds for this in about 3 months at this range, but I'd still like to improve the project in the 3-6 months following until I'm fully satisfied with it. What are my options for materials in bulk? I'd like to ideally buy online. I'm not particularly interested in wood, as I'd prefer something a little bit more modern and consistently manufactured. If there is a kit available that falls in this range, that'd be great. I don't quite trust the prices of kits, but if there's a good enough deal on one I'd choose that route. 


* I'd prefer to use a floor plan


* I want a small but function bathroom with a toilet, extra soap etc). Are there any retailers that have modern versions of these that would fit into a small space? I have an idea for a semi-circle idea for the bathroom that should be pretty nice. 


* Is there any site/company with a lot of dual-use+ furniture? Transforming couches are awesome. Furniture is what's mostly likely to be added after the project is complete. 


* I will mostly be using this for writing and as a small music studio. As such

I'm sorta working some side projects pitching the idea of small houses for the masses, I'm doubtful the majority of families or couples are willing to make that transition. So what size is the magic compromise in size that is small enough to make a difference environmentally yet without sacrificing the lifestyle that most people have become accustomed too? I think the magic number is somewhere between 1000-1500sqft for the ideal house. Just looking for some feedback on that. Does the tiny house community think that's wasteful opulence, while still being seen as miniscule by the mcmansion crowd, and effectively creating a house with no market? Thoughts?

This is a ""tiny house"" i stayed in for about a week for work. It's at a wildlife sanctuary park, what i liked (and didn't like) about it, how it could be improved for permanent living.

[**Sketchy paint floor plan**](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#13)

**Quick tour:**

[First photo](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#0) is looking at it from outside. Full undercover parking. What was clever about this design was that the balcony was raised so that you could easily unload the back of the ute. Might not be great for small vehicles

[Main Deck](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#1) is probably the highlight of the house. It overlooked a gorge which was fantastic. It was an open veranda with no railings, and not get mud all through the house. But at the same time, you weren't leaving your boots exposed to the elements. It's a shame it is winter here in Australia, otherwise this would have been used more often.

[Entrance](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#2) - simple door

[Main living room](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#3) with [fireplace](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#4) which was a godsend when coming home cold and wet. Little hanging rack for large kitchen implements

[Master bedroom](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#7) Large queen bed

Worlds largest [shower](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#9) for the smallest house. Shower floor was steel and had raised edges 1 ft high to keep the water in. [Toilet](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#10) was for emergencies (there was a toilet outside for regular use)

**Problems/How i would improve the house**

First and foremost, the balcony was hardly used. I think that's worth taking into consideration depending on the climate. If there was an issue with flies, i'd consider screening off the entire deck, that would make it much better at night.

- More hooks - for coats etc. It would have been great to have hooks around the place for jackets. If not on [wall next to the door on the outside](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#2)
- More storage - no storage of any kind
- Toilet was an emergency toilet
- A place inside to sit and relax
- Bar stools were kind of useless, 
- Outside clothes line
- This place only had one powerpoint (for the fridge)
- The [kitchen hooks need to be in a better place](http://imgur.com/a/VG9SQ#12). When you lift the stove lid
- Thicker doors (especially on the toilet) - a rickety old bi-fold door wasn't great at keeping smell/moisture etc in the bathroom.
- Air exhausts in the kitchen was required. You really need and exhaust (or the window) moved over where the stove is.
- Round sinks don't really interest me

**What features did you really like about the house?**

- hardwood floors only - easier to clean etc
- Large undercover veranda - take off boots etc
- I like the idea of the corrugated iron walls (upto 1m high). Might make them out of a different material though (cold to touch in winter)

**Would i live in the house?**

Yes

I slightly modified [these plans](http://www.tinyhousedesign.com/2011/09/05/8x12-tiny-house-free-plans/) and built it in a couple of weeks with two friends.  I had zero carpentry experience and they had very little.

It's in the middle of the mountains in Alaska

Modifications of plans:  
I skipped the siding and paint.  I added a 8x6 loft inside.  I bought used windows that were sized differently than the plans call for

I just have a small Coleman camping stove now, water is hauled unless I pay a well-digger to come out, electricity would require a noisy generator.

Happy to answer any questions.

EDIT: The dimensional lumber was milled locally by a homesteader in the area.  I bought everything else at Home Depot and fit into one pickup truck load, so I had to make damn sure we got _everything_ in one load.",,False,self,t5_2rab5,1353176986.0,,

I also LOVE the idea of smart

I created a home design on the iPhone app linked a few days ago and would like some critique on it

As you can see, plus a cooker (or at the least a camping stove), a canopy for exhaust removal, a microwave and bar fridge. The bathroom is pretty straightforward, except I'd build a cupboard for the washer (or just use a laundromat).
