""Hello all

So there are two ways to say this

The Short Version.
Both the Streetlight Manifesto album ""The Hands That Thieve"" and the Toh Kay companion album ""The Hand That Thieves"" are being pushed back to a later release date

The Long Version:
So, on Nov 6th. I'd normally say ""on behalf of everyone in Streetlight"" but that'd be misleading. I am entirely and solely at fault for the delay of these records and I take full responsibilty for it. I simply put too much on my plate and lined up too many deadlines and tours, and I just couldn't finish everything in time, between writing, recording, planning and my now notorious but unavoidable tendency to remix, rewrite and, redo everything a few times before it's ""just right"". We announced the album prematurely and in a rush because of a number of factors that lined up in August, solid release date but that just hasn't happened yet for a number of reasons, one that will hopefully ease the frustration of the prolonged wait.
In the meantime, and we'll be sharing live versions of the songs soon, as well as (finally) some proper samples from the record(s). 
Once again, with my constant remixing, rewriting, starting again from scratch and making promises i end up unable to meet. I am sorry.

Thanks

Take the biggest tour of the past four years that recently swept through the Northeast. All great ska headliners and reunions in one show. Pietasters

You telling me there's not one smaller band you can invite on tour to get some exposure? The Snails? Royal City Riot? Green Room Rockers? The Pomps? The Forthrights?

She is happiest when we are down in the basement listening to it.  If she is screaming I can turn it on and she will instantly start smiling.  We bring a tablet with Pandora streaming wherever we can.  The problem is the language in most of the songs.  As funny as it would be for my son to repeat some of that my wife would kill me.

Any advice on music a really bright and observant 4 year old could listen too?

He does really like the song Mr. Smiley by Mustard plug

EDIT:  Thanks for all the suggestions.  This got far more replies than I thought it would.  Thank you for chiming in should make for a happy baby and keep the 4 year old from repeating things he shouldn't.

I found a CD I made a while ago for a car trip and forgot about here is what was on it.

**1. Who gets to decide what you play live?**

Chris usually comes up with a set list

**2. Is there a story behind the song ""The Rest of My Life""? I am aware that Mark Hoppus co-wrote it

I wrote that song with Mark and Vinnie. Mark had the majority of the song written. I just rearranged it

**3. Why

Have you ever been there?? If not


**4. Who are your favourite bands from the current crop of UK ska bands? (The Skints

The Skints, Reel Big Fish...they're new right? Aaron said they were new...


**5. Ok I hate to be the one asking this question

I went to a S&amp;M dungeon with Fat Mike, whipped, candle wax poured on me and my balls stepped on. THEN it got weird....


**6. You guys are releasing live recordings of your albums, or maybe even In With The Out Crowd? Cause I fucking love Borders in Boundaries and wish you would play more of it live.**

Yes


**7. Why did they feel the need to re-record Look What Happened? The original is vastly superior

We actually weren't going to rerecord it but either our producer (Rob Cavallo) or A&amp;R guy had a hard on for that song and wanted us to re-record it. We've done it before (See: Johnny Quest and Jen) so we didn't think too much of it.


**8. Why won't you guys ever play ""We're All Dudes"" live? I asked Vinnie and his answer was unsatisfactory. If you can play the iCarly theme song

Because we didn't sing on it. Kel Mitchell wrote the words and he threatened to sue us if we ever performed it live and didn't pay him performance royalties. Fuck that guy.


**9. Why did LTJ drop the ska / horns for a while

I have been in the band for 12 years and have played my horn on every record. We have ska songs on every record. We also have been writing songs without horns since the beginning of the bands career


**10. How did you get the opportunity work with LTJ? Were they concerned that you played tenor rather than bari?**

We had a mutual friend that suggested me to the guys after Derron quit. I don't think they were as concerned with the horn's voicing as much as they were concerned that the person they chose ""fit "". They obviously made the wrong choice.


**11. When writing/recording

We're like brothers. We all fight constantly


**12. I'd really like to know more about his past with Spring Heeled Jack

Someone is apparently doing a documentary on the band so stay tuned...


**13. Whats his favorite song to play?**

The last song on the set list :)


**14. This is more of a genre-based question

We've never been a traditional ""ska"" band. We've always been far more punk influenced. I personally am a HUGE ska fan, is ""ska influenced"" or ""ska based"" music. The only real ska band, in my opinion, are The Skatalites. If you're not sure who they are, check it out. THAT is real ska.

After that whole diatribe, it's not intentional if a band switches sounds. There are a combination of factors that can influence it, which may include their A&amp;R's opinion, manager's opinions, booking agent opinions, co-writer's opinions, producers opinions...the list goes on.

It's hard to make someone who isn' t involved with the music industry fully understand why decisions are made. I've always said when you have your band you can make your own decisions. Seems like a dick head answer


**15. How do you deal with homesickness/being on the road so often?**
