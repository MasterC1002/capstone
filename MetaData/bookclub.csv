1339407209.0,uvxki,Reddit Infinite Summer 2012,thewretchedhole,131,15,70,"Hi everyone

Infinite Jest is set in an alternate reality America and is essentially about a movie that is so entertaining that anyone who watches it loses all desire to do anything but watch. It is a demanding book that requires some work from the reader, but at its heart it is deeply philosophical, and tells us what it feels like to live in this strange world of ours.  

The reading schedule (which can be found [here](http://infinitesummer.org/index)) allocates &lt;100pages a week. This is more than manageable to keep up with, but of course, the golden rule^2 of bookclubs still applies. 

Questions^3 ? Comments ? Insults ?

* [Our Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.

&gt; The Picture of Dorian Gray was a succès de scandale. Early readers were shocked by its hints at unspeakable sins and the book was later used as evidence against Wilde at the Old Bailey in 1895. Enthralled by his own exquisite portrait, where he is able to indulge his desires while remaining a gentleman in the eyes of polite society. Only Dorian's picture bears the traces of his decadence. A knowing account of a secret life and an analysis of the darker side of late Victorian society. The Picture of Dorian Gray offers a disturbing portrait of an individual coming face to face with the reality of his soul

1373724648.0,1i7umx,Here are some notes I have from reading Notes from Underground,Asian_Persuasion,27,3,4,"http://imgur.com/ekeyHqF

Note that I have more notes on the first part than the second since the first part does most of the philosophical work.

I've also finished The Orphan Master's Son from this month's reading if anyone wants to discuss that too.

EDIT: Added the text to the post -- I'm not sure why I didn't do that in the first place.

Part I

**""Now, and it is only the fool who becomes anything.""**

I think there are a couple ways to take this. One is that an intelligent person is always trying to be something. He will always attempt to fit himself into some kind of category, would unwittingly do so because he is trying to take action on something. Even if that action is to try and do nothing, it is an action that is consciously taken and with a reason.

However, plumber, fool, etc.), he can become anything he wants to be. He is outside the categories of being that are set up in society and in people's minds. In this manner, the fool can be anything he wants to be.

The second way to look at this is that the intelligent man can't look at anything that is capable of him being (i.e. whatever profession is out there) in a serious manner. The intelligent person sees the absurdity in being anything (a la Camus) since to be anything in life is meaningless. The fool does not think in these terms (or has not thought this far/deep?) and will always try to be something. The fool does not realize the absurdity of life and strives for something that is inherently without any meaning.

**""Such a gentlemen simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down

I think, but for those that 'think and consequently do nothing', 'it is not an excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe it ourselves, as a rule'. After typing this out, this actually seems kind of self-explanatory.

Actually, but includes the laws of nature (i.e. physics and mathematics). When a man of action reaches this wall, he cannot get over it because he is reconciled with it and deems it an impossible goal to overcome it. The existentialist will attempt to anyhow, because, in the mind of the existentialist, there does not exist a category of ‘impossible’.

**“’Possibly’,’ and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I speak as one who knows.”**

I am pretty sure this ‘slap in the face’ is supposed to be some ultra-emotional event in life

**“[H]e knows better than anyone that he is only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing…and that he is only amusing himself like that from ill-humour

I think that Dostoevsky’s spite and enjoyment derived from that spite arises from the reactions that rises from ‘men of action’ due to the existentialist’s own actions. The moaning existentialist knows that, but he also knows that moaning makes the ‘men of action’ feel uncomfortable. He derives enjoyment from others not recognizing the absurd. It is almost like he is enjoying the feeling of control he has or that he is laughing at the world for not seeing what he sees.

**“Oh, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to being nor to finish anything.”**

Existentialism, after some more self-reflection, just appeared. This leads to a never-ending loop of moving the goal-post, leading to inaction.

Is this like: to be nothing

**“The only gain of civilization for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations—and nothing more.”**

I suppose this is true

**“Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature

Isn’t this predicated on the assumption that humans do not make mistakes (not to mention that humans are completely rational actors)? Of course, at least make it accurate.

**“One’s own free unfettered choice, one’s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy—is that very ‘most advantageous advantage’ which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms.”**

So, long-term thinking, morals, ethics, etc., but it can be, and has been

**“Indeed, man will at once cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be certain to.”**

I agree with this. Who wants to willingly make the wrong choice? What defines a human is their fallibility. Without that

Or perhaps it would eventually get created - this formula - but the people that it will have been created for would be so different as to render them non-human by the standards of today. Essentially, but not the current ones. Otherwise, with current human rationality, I don’t see how any human decision prediction can occur with any sense of certainty unless with such specificity as to render the formula useless for all people.

Or maybe this could actually be accomplished, but if limited to any individual scale, it is useless. In that case, and this is one that I can see being the most true out of the ones I’ve posited, Dostoevsky’s musings on science is non-applicable.

**“[T]here is one case, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid—simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not bound to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible.”**

Haha, the freedom allowed in doing so leaves it oh so satisfying. I think this is the essence of existentialism. It is the freedom to make decisions against any sense of category or structure, of any designation, -- this is to say, with the utmost freedom allowable. 

In his words: “[I]t preserves for us what is most precious and most important – that is

**“In short

Damn

**“But how do you know

Doesn’t this depend on the context on which it is asked? He says that, this seems to only apply to a man that asks the question of advantage to himself. When asking the question in a third person perspective, it is the consequences that matter, not the process.

**“Does not man

Plato would say that this is impossible. How can you desire something that is not good? Even if you desire to suffer

Part II

**“Only donkeys and mules are valiant

What does this mean? Only those that don’t think are valiant? Only those that are tools are valiant?

**“’Why dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I remember there was real feeling in me

It looks like he performed an almost ultimate form of deception. His desire to exercise power was so great that he derived feelings to fuel his speech to Liza just to give what he said the power to affect her. This guy is fucking committed.

**“And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the neck.”**

Lolwut? This was actually pretty funny just because of how ridiculous the action was.

**“It had happened that in my fury I did not even ask him what he wanted

In that world of normal and recognisable appearance live Aomame, an independent woamn who works as a gym instructor, a math teacher. They are both close to being 30

* **Some quotes**
 (My apologies for the broken english

""'1Q84, the landscape has changed. I have to adapt quickly to the character of this world in the shape of a question mark. Like an animal freed in a new forest'.""

""That landscape to the other side of the window suggested the world was situated between ""the tragic"" and ""the absence of joy"" and that it was composed from the infinite accumulation of small worlds that acquire their very own shape.""

It had been long since I read a book that gave me goosebumps. Even though this book is almost 1000 pages and can be slow at times, and the personality of the main characters is carefully developed. It is one of those books that definitely need a re-read. 

**Next up: Korea! The book will be *""Please take care of mum""* by Kyung-Sook Shin.** 

*Please feel free to recommend me the most significant XXth century authors from your country and an interesting work by them!* 

Those I have already:

* Russia: Solzhenytsin's *A day in the life of Ivan Denisovich*. 
* Germany: Gunter Grass
* Canada: Margaret Atwood
* US: William Faulkner
* Mongolia: Galsan Tschinag

What I first remarked upon reading the opening scene is that **it's written in a cinematic way**.  The author

I love the way Ellis puts two sentences side by side to show us the mania that is the *Bateman's* mind.  He achieves a beautiful display minimalism when conveying so much (humor

&lt;bold text is excerpt from the book&gt;

example 1:  Bateman is in the process of getting drunk at a dinner party.  He's had maybe 2-3 drinks and he only just arrived: **""I make myself another drink. I worry about the sodium level in the soy sauce.""**

example 2: Bateman comments on a dinner guest's appearance at that same dinner party: **""Stash’s admittedly cheap

It's also very interesting to consider Bateman's unique ability to size up what other people are wearing to a *T*.  The first thing he remarks about anyone worth talking to is what they are wearing and how they are wearing it.  Yet when he returns to his house he cannot even recognize the door man.  **""he could be anybody""**

Finally

Who the hell gets anxious about not having dinner reservations and then doesn't even flinch when the waitress brings the wrong appetizers to the table?   Apparently an American psycho does.

These “night people” are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Eri’s slumber—mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime—will either restore or annihilate her.

I am reading World War Z the book and was at the North Korean/South Korean chapter. Up until this point of the book I had been pleasantly surprised at how accurate and realistic Max Brooks portrayal of a Zombie event was. (I mean yes except for the whole Zombie part.) After reading what happened to North Korea

I guess you could argue that maybe it was meant to be a temporary thing and the fact that the North Koreans haven't emerged in this long must confirm the idea that they are now all a trapped underground Zombie army. But that just brings up another thing that has bothered me about the book. I know we are supposed to accept that Zombies are real to read this book but it felt almost jarring to read a book that seems so realistic in its portrayal of a mass panic caused by Zombies only to keep dismissing how stupid the Zombie idea is. 

I mean why not create a Zombie that will need some energy source. If the Zombies don't attack each other and like in the North Korean example are all stuck underground then how did they survive for ten years? I guess what I am saying is that reading this chapter took me out of the book world and brought me back to reality. It just didn't fit.

So I am nearing the end of a project that I hope may be of interest to some of you out there. I am a professional musician, themes, and landscape of this story. I know that book-inspired albums have been released in the past, but this album was meant to follow the story arc, and ultimately be a companion to the story, while also retaining universality in the themes, allowing the songs to stand on their own.

So, and production on our album will be finishing in the next month or so. To make a long story short we visited Ami McKay, who lives on the east coast of Canada, and brought her a demo of the album this past summer. She loved the idea and the songs, and we are now working towards continuing this collaboration. To read about the story of our visit, check out her blog at www.amimckay.com. 

If you are curious for more info about the project or to hear some music

Although it's called the Neuropsychology Book Club because 'neuropsychology' is easy to appreviate, or social psychology; education and/or development; cognitive science; neuroscience; and any related disciplines.

It should also be of interest to fans of popular-science books, brains. All books chosen will be books written for the layperson, unless there is a huge clamoring for a more technical book, and books will be selected based on suggestions and votes from the members. In general the reading rate will be 1 book per month, like a traditional book club (at least until we see how this goes and adjust the pace accordingly).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first book up

The discussion will get started on or around July 15, beg, borrow, or pirate a copy and start reading. Hopefully, the discussion will continue for a few weeks, until it's time to move on to the next book, which will be [Switch](http://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278874270&amp;sr=1-1) by Chip and Dan Heath (books after that are wide open to suggestion).

I'm hoping that this will be a fun, I will be posting some discussion questions every few days or so as needed, and I will also try to link companion articles (like any studies talked about in the text) over in [r/Neuropsychology](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuropsychology) for interested readers.

(BTW, here's what I bring to the table:

* I'm a [pediatric neuropsychologist](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ak9ne/i_am_a_neuropsychologist_ask_me_almost_anything/) (slow link)
* I read lots and lots of pop sci books and NP textbooks

Personally I loved so much about this: the characters, the coming to america sketches. I understand they brought insight to how certain gods were formed and brought over, but it didn't feel necessary to the overall plot. Also, the climactic moment ""backstage"" where shadow ends the battle of the gods, was almost too familiar. Gaiman, along with pratcher, did something very similar in good omens with the antichrist. Some recurring endings i suppose.

So what do we think of Addie? She's kind of the main character

Also, they mean something completely different out of context. The style of the narrative &amp; vernacular of the Deep South seem to make everything explode with meaning. Example:

*""That was when I learned that words are no good; that words don't ever fit even what they are trying to say at... [Anse] had a word

Seems like a meditation on our individualism &amp; subjectivity

Here's my favourite quote from the chapter: *""And so when Cora Tull wouild tell me I was not a true mother, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. Like Cora, who could never even cook""*

I liked the little stab about Cora's cooking (which is clearly an important apart of womanhood

But anyway, but when she had Darl she felt deceived by Anse and his word 'love'. So her reaction is to take revenge, and the revenge for her is that they will never know she was doing it. This isn't entirely the reason all these people are fucked up, but it certainly plays a big part. Cora &amp; Darl also point out in their narratives that Addie is partial to Jewel, (I don't really know why, maybe she appreciates that he's a gaping asshole) but  mostly she feels like motherhood is the best way to live life until you make it to the grave. As her father always said:

*""I could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time""*

Also

*""I gave Anse Dewey Dell to negagtive Jewel. Then I gave him Vardaman to replace the child I had robbed him of. And now he has three children that are his and not mine.""*

Towards the end of GR, a complete reading of Colonel Blicero's tarot. This might seem bizarre or digressive in any other narrative context, but in a novel which rarely stays in one genre for more than a few pages, it reads simply as another inquisitive offshoot. The reason I mention it is not because it is a remarkable passage per se, but because it momentarily distils the mercurial narrative voice into something unambiguous, which nevertheless maintains the same intent which it has held through the entire novel theretofore. 

In short

A little earlier Slothrop has looked at a newspaper with an image of the mushroom cloud hovering above Hiroshima and seen it as a huge nebulous cock plunging into the ground. He is a man whose life has been defined by his libido - and its perversely contra-temporal relationship with the V2 - and so when he is confronted with this sign, much as there is a set of engineering principles which governs the operation of a V2, but nobody has ever understood the Bomb. No human mind has ever been able to contain the loss which is effected by a weapon of such absurd power. And yet we live in a post-atomic age, and Pynchon was writing in a time when the threat of planetary annihilation was more immediate than at any other point in human history. It's easy, and possibly specious, to see all literature written during the cold war in these dystopian terms, but GR is a book which is intimately concerned with the practicalities of warfare, there is little which we can imagine at this point

Naturally, and perhaps some sympathy for those who oppose your preconceptions of what the answer might be. Slothrop is identified over and over again as a paranoiac, one who sees the operation of the incorporeal Them in every situation he finds himself in, and Pynchon never quite lets us know whether the world the reader sees - in which his paranoid delusions are entirely justified - is the true reality, or merely one distorted through the lens of his egotism, but the eventual effect of the book must be to ridicule any attempt to locate patterns of providence or justice or even logic in the events which ensue. In The Zone, the post-war, post-moral realm of confusion and madness, many plots and subplots in GR, venal human beings.

Many people read T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land* as an explicit response to the First World War, and it is worth reading for that reason alone. There's no denying that it's a difficult novel, which at times seems intentionally alienating, but I think that if you consider it in the above terms, as a piece of narrative art which demonstrates the futility of applying former systems of value or significance to modern warfare, it is far easier to comprehend.",,,,

I admit I did skim over various sections of the book which I found unreadable:  the violent torture scenes, I have since added 'Whitney Houston' to my Mp3 player).

Skipping parts of books would usually seem reprehensible but I feel like the author would condone it with this supporting passage: 

&gt;It’s as if her mind is having a hard time communicating with her mouth, of course, an impossibility: there … is … no … key.

There is no key to understanding this book.  The Music description scenes are just there to distract.  It's all just a weird Salvadorian Bistro.  A living hallucination.

Instead of merely operating like a real-life club, let's have discussion threads for popular novels. We have to start small. We'll start broad discussions of commonly read novels, and open up the floor for different analyses and readings. Discussion will focus on the bigger picture, which will allow for more participation, because no one actually has to go read the book.

Bigger-picture discussions will allow us to, who want to partake without having to commit. Finally, with more readers, we can eventually focus on the details of the books of the month. 

Basically

Is anyone interested? I can start a few discussion threads with questions. What books would you be interested in?

So, I have just a couple things to say.

I initially didn't think to post here because my idea will involve all of king's books

The Dark Tower books would be included in books that we can discuss for the week

Here is the copy paste.

So, a quick search of ""Misery"" brought up nothing at all. I was slightly disappointed. This led to me having an idea.

What if, we would discuss parts of that book, help other people remember reading it, and then perhaps we could also post a comment in that topic that said our vote for next week was whatever book we wanted.

Then

It would be easy to avoid spoilers

If this idea take off, since I have very recently read both of them.

What does everyone think?

I've already gotten a few comments (all positive) about the idea, comment it with ideas, or whatever to make sure a bunch of people see it.

If you are interested

A lumberman by trade, Jeb takes the next steamer out of Saginaw to the wilds of northern Michigan, where endless pine forests and prosperity are waiting.

And, a new job, new forests, and even a new romance. But it also brings with it a life-threatening illness, a deadly rival, and a mysterious woman who seems to always be just outside of Jeb’s vision. Will Jeb ever get the life he has been longing for?
