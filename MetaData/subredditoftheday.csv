1359608602.0,17m25i,January 31st. /r/MensRights. Advocating for the social and legal equality of men and boys since 2008,XavierMendel,2657,1325,3523,"#/r/MensRights

**59

The topic at hand today takes a generous turn from our amusing and lighthearted articles of the month. On this, indeed, across the world as being one of the few centers for men's help. It's often attacked, and is always the center of one controversy or the other. My questions reflect that. MensRights is, undoubtedly, the home of great activists.

There were some people close to me that suggested I not run this article. That the repercussions of doing so would be unreasonably bad. Well

/r/MensRights. Never in our society could the uninitiated imagine such a place. A place where feminism is questioned, ""when you mean they're alone in this regard?"" No, hypothetical 19th century British gentleman, I do not. I truly mean it when I say that. What other subreddit openly questions feminism? None spring to mind, and I make it my duty to catalog various subreddits. Most end up banned or run down within a month. Only /r/MensRights remains.

Nobody can say for sure whether or not they're correct in any single regard. It's certain that, it's also certain that they're correct in *most* of them. Occasionally a wackjob or two will suggest that feminism is behind Cinnamon Toast Crunch (The taste you can see!™). The accuser latches onto those wackjobs to denounce the whole movement. It has happened thousands of times before, all over the world. Yet, when the reverse happens, the person gets the dogs sicced on them, saying they're anti-women, a rapist sympathizer, a misogynist

I support the struggles of people who are in bad positions. I respect it, nor will it end until my death. For I struggle with something that will not go away through legislation or social change. The Men's Rights Movement, however, struggles with something very changeable. Very malleable, able to be fixed within a generation if so desired. So I will support them, for they have a fighting chance.

**NOTICE**: I was informed that a section of this was hateful. After rereading it in a different light

**NOTICE 2**: I was informed that the edited section is also misleading. Not really

/r/MensRights is controversial for a reason. In the same sense as Jews of the 1890s, and many more. Each generation has their controversial improvement in society. We've gotten off easy so far, but we have to make it happen eventually. As far back as anyone living can remember, the table has been imbalanced in one way or another, favoring men or women. It's time the table stays level for once. We need equality.

And that's what /r/MensRights is trying to do.

Instead of asking the specific /r/MensRights mods questions individually, from /r/MensRights to you, here are the answers to some good questions.

&gt;#1. Men's Rights is the source of frequent controversy

&gt;&gt;**MensRights** The Men's Rights movement (MRM) is a nebulous collection of people with different views and different goals
&gt;&gt;
Some of the common themes, b) patriarchy isn't an accurate description of the cause of society's mistreatment of individuals, and c) we can't teach people to view equality as a noble goal by implementing laws and policies that clearly discriminate based on gender.

&gt;#2. Many subreddits of your size and notoriety are looked to by trolls and attackers alike. What's an average day like in the moderation chair?

&gt;&gt;**MensRights** I think a number of moderators of other subreddits are familiar with the Manhood Academy spammer, and have been experiencing nearly since our inception. Every once in a while, someone gets upset at a moderation decision and decides to go on a spam rampage... but I don't think they realize that with so many of us it is far, far less work for us to remove the spam than it is for them to make it.
&gt;&gt;
Members of ShitRedditSays have made no secret that they don't approve of us, they just harass us with words, so we try to ignore and move on.
&gt;&gt;
As moderators, but we have to draw a line when such opponents get belligerent or troll-like. Our community is pretty good at reporting these things, though, and they make our job as moderators much easier. Most of our work consists of going through the mod-queue and approving or removing things as fits our moderation policy.

&gt;#3. Reddit is a wonderful platform for collaborative discussions

&gt;&gt;**MensRights** Our relationship with Reddit has been rocky lately. We have had some disagreements with the admins over their selective enforcement of their rules. But otherwise

&gt;#4. The biggest thing I've seen in MRA is the amount of misconceptions about it. What are some of the common falsehoods

&gt;&gt;**MensRights** It is a weird phenomenon when someone refers to the movement or the subreddit as ""MRA"", you are from MRA."" But that is beside the point.
Some of the common misconceptions about the MRM is that its members believe women have no problems or challenges facing them as a gender, that we are all virgins or neckbeards or whatever ad hominems are used. This usually comes down to someone basing their view on a selective reading of a small subset of people who tend to be very internet-loud.
&gt;&gt;
In the most recent survey
&gt;&gt;
The number of actual misogynists on /r/MensRights, and I challenge anyone to prove me wrong. There is a huge difference between someone feeling offended and actual misogyny, which is the hatred of women. The real problem we face is that many of the people who spread these misconceptions are adherents of [post-modern discourse](http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/regiftedxmas12.html). Specifically see the point in the link where it says post-modernists ""will typically try, not to answer opponents with better arguments, but to silence them completely as ‘hateful’, ‘intolerant’, ‘bigoted’, ‘homophobic’
&gt;&gt;
For example, where we have statistics to back up our claims, we are still accused of being misogynists. Yes, these are sensitive topics for people, but that doesn't mean that the common narrative is correct or that these issues can't or shouldn't be debated.

&gt;#5. That about wraps things up here for now. Is there anything else you would like to say?

&gt;&gt;**MensRights** Thanks for featuring us in Subreddit of the Day. [For more information

Although Basshunter is probably using Skype these days and Anna probably isn't around much anymore since Valve has got those cheats locked down, I guess it's changed a lot *but* the idea is the same! The ~~Sentinel~~ Radiant in the bottom left and The ~~Scourge~~ Dire in the upper right meeting in the forests of ~~Ashenvale~~...Valveland?...to do epic battle! With the second coming of the game it's a lot more polished and has a lot of extra thingies added to it. Cool skins, cool cosmetic items (think hats but *cooler!*), better graphics, better hero selection, better chat, better...just about everything is better. 

For those not in the know, Going On Two Sides (A.S.S.F.A.G.G.O.T.S.) where there are two teams with 5 players on each side. Each player gets to pick a hero and level them up choosing from 5 different abilities. The goal is to push with your team to the enemy's base and destroy it. It sounds simple but it's like Go. Easy to pick up, hard to master, and the combinations are infinite (okay, they aren't but there are a lot of them). 

/r/Dota2 is a community built around the game. If you're new and looking for help then check out the sidebar or feel free to join in on the discussion. If you're an old grizzled veteran from Warcraft 3 looking to get into the new game then this a good place to start. If you're a follower of the competitive scene then you will find lively discussion here about the matches and a nice little schedule in the sidebar. If you're a Dota 2 regular and are just looking for a place to hang out and talk about the game

I talked to the moderators of /r/Dota2 to find out what interests them about the game.

&gt;##1. Why Dota 2?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai Dota is the game that I have invested the most time in

&gt;&gt;   Besides that, the robust options for choice. It's a game that you never tire of.

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 Dota provides a deep and compelling experience unrivaled by any other game I've played. If you don't mind starting out rough and taking the time to learn and practice, players and personalities and watching their games can keep you entertained for years.

&gt;&gt;   /u/nefastable The depth of the gameplay, all of these things make it that I can keep playing Dota2 and still be constantly surprised by how things work out, while having a lot of fun in the meantime.

&gt;##2. Did you start playing DotA in Warcraft 3 or is Dota 2 your first Dota experience?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai I played WC3 DotA originally casually with friends

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 I started with the original [DotA](http://www.getdota.com/) about 8 years ago as most of the people I knew at the time started playing it. I loved the game instantly and I've been playing it since. I've also played both HoN and quite a lot of LoL in the meantime.

&gt;&gt;   /u/nefastable A friend of mine

&gt;##3. Who is your favorite hero?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai Probably Jakiro as he's the hero I have [played the most](https://dotabuff.com/players/23223261/matches?hero=jakiro&amp;game_mode=&amp;match_type=real) and I personally think is my best hero

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 Even though it's quite probably [Windrunner](http://www.dota2.com/hero/Windrunner/), I'm going to go for a hipster choice and say [Clockwerk](http://www.dota2.com/hero/Clockwerk/), a.k.a. Spiderman.

&gt;&gt;   /u/nefastable Leshrac is my go to hero for when I need to feel really comfortable in a specific role

&gt;##4. What is your favorite item?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai Veil of Discord goes hand-in-hand with my love of Jakiro

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 [Force Staff](http://www.dota2wiki.com/wiki/Force_Staff)

&gt;&gt;   /u/nefastable Even though it has been nerfed a while ago

&gt;##5. What is your favorite skin?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai Dota 2 doesn't really have ""skins"" per say

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 With item sets being the closest to a skin

&gt;&gt;   /u/nefastable The only real skin I have is the Elemental Ice Infusion skin for Tiny

&gt;##6. Favorite cosmetic item?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai [Drodos](http://www.dota2wiki.com/wiki/Drodo_the_Druffin)! I have three of them from The International.

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 If I had to pick one item

&gt;&gt;   Hero-wise

&gt;&gt;   /u/nefastable I love my [Squiddles](http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/57939733)! Tidehunter just looks amazingly silly when he drags that squid around.

&gt;##7. If you could pick anyone to voice the announcer who would it be?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai Hmm

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 There's a ton of amazing characters in gaming that would fit the role well

&gt;&gt;   /u/nefastable Sir Ian McKellen would fit in perfectly, so it isn't unlikely that she would do more voice work for Valve. And I'd love to hear what they would write for a GLaDoS announcer, she had such a great sense of [black] humour in the Portal games.

&gt;##8. Do you have anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;   /u/ReaverXai I just want to thank all the people that make Dota 2 and r/Dota2 a great and always exciting community to be a part of. Here's to 2013 - the year of Dota 2!

&gt;&gt;   /u/0Hellspawn0 To anyone that hasn't tried out Dota2 - You should give it a shot

Atheism is the mental state of someone who does not believe in a god, and actively seeks to destroy the murderous society wrought by these primitive gods. The absence of a quota of conversions to our cause has only allowed numbers to soar, giving us nearly two millions brothers in arms over the years. While we're a major minority (only one in a billion people are atheists), we have a spark that some would call holy in us. Or maybe... UNHOLY. Yeah, I went there.

As a change from my recent feature, stupid people (see: religion, under section: idiot) are in general really bad. The only good religion is a dead one. Dead religions (re: good ones) often have primitive animal gods, or that of rain and snow and whatnot. They accept ritualistic sacrifices and murder anyone that doesn't worship them. Oh wait, did I say dead religions? I meant Christianity ofc lol.

Christianity, is the source of every death, directly or indirectly, in world history. In the way of ""do the crime, do the time"", it's our duty, nay, to wipe out this cult. We do this by converting them to our group wherever we find them. Parties, we fight them on all fronts. As that one Scottish guy once said

My own relationship with atheism is something that might resemble the heroic epic of Odysseus. While in the evil mindrape factory (church) I was awakened by some sort of spark in my brain that made the world slow and my brain crash into a billion new thoughts. Whenever I woke up in the hospital, I came out of it pertecfly heathly. After updating my style a bit I set out on my quest. The nearest enemy encampment was a funeral home about twelve miles from my rural home. After a quick bus ride, during which I hyped myself up for the approaching battle, I arrived. Like a soldier landing on the beaches of Normandy in the D-Day invasion (though much braver in my opinion), I set out on my quest. The sheep were inside, praying to their false idol, and so I made my move. Bursting through the door like a gazelle, sheeple!""

The theocratic establishment expelled me from the building, I ended the first day of the last religion.

Whenever I became a parent to two young sons

The enemy deserves a spot here if only for their horribleness. They're racists, I won't give up. One way or the other I'll wipe this religion and its customs off the Earth. I'll think of something eventually; I have to. It's my destiny. I will push through this smog of hatred so that America may rise in a glorious scientific power once again in one last stroke of power. One last work of humanity. Its final solution.

Until I can

Today we have a special guest for you. In order to remain unbiased

&gt;#1. Thanks for coming. First

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** I'm just a guy

&gt;#2.  What's your relationship with atheism?

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** Christianity killed my parents when I was just a kid. Ever since I've been dedicated to fighting it whenever I can. Not for my benefit

&gt;#3. Describe yourself to the people that don't know what to look for in a scientific and logical individual.

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** You can usually tell a logical man by his classy attire. Sweat pants to show that we don't care for *their* uptight natures, but because it makes us look dapper. We usually have sweet beards, showing that we're like the godless and badass vikings of old. Though the retarded god lovers may laugh, it symbolizes something they could never hope to achieve with their cult. Coolness.

&gt;#4. Logical people have a lot of heroes. Who are yours?

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** To name a few: Albert Einstein, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Carl Sagan, James Dewar, and of course, Wil Wheaton.

&gt;#5. Thanks for coming

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** Fuck the police.

Wonderful

To sum it all up, under the ~~fascist~~ democratic America, we have a bigger set of problems. One day we'll win, and live like kings.

[League of Legends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends) is a ""MOBA"" (multiplayer online battle arena) inspired by the classic [Defense of the Ancients for WarCraft III](http://www.wowwiki.com/Defense_of_the_Ancients_%28Warcraft_III_map%29) which was itself inspired by the classic but almost forgotten [Aeon of Strife](http://sc.nibbits.com/maps/project/76162/aeon-of-strife-2-beta5). I used to play Warcraft III *a lot*. I was a big fan of the AoS genre (what would become called MOBAs). But I was too hipster and edgy to play DoTA so I played [Tides of Blood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsRl_YS6QBU) and other silly games like Elemental TD and Island Defense. With League of Legends there are three lanes and you get to pick and [control](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjRFrbvmHRo) a champion while AI controlled units spawn every 30 seconds or something like that and attack the other AI controlled units. The goal is to push enough to get to the enemy's main base and destroy it. 

I used to play League of Legends. Or rather

And if you don't have a lot of money because you spent it all on the Steam holiday sale then [don't cry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypit0NcNV-8) because League of Legends is free. Another good thing is that there's two sides to it. You've got your folks who just like to play the game and have fun and then you have your folks who are obsessed with ELO. Personally, probably more obsessed than these LoLers and I don't even play the game, at least not anymore.

&gt;##1. Why League of Legends?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Jaraxo It's FREE! You get a fantastic game, some great personalities and you don't have to pay a penny.

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll Because you feel like a total badass from level 1 onwards! Also

&gt;##2. What's your favorite champion?

&gt;&gt;    /u/Jaraxo Got to be Amumu. Sad little mummy child with no one to love

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll Diana, Miss Fortune, Caitlyn, Teemo... There's too many to list D:

&gt;##3. What's your favorite champion's dance?

&gt;&gt;    /u/Jaraxo Malzahar is pretty awesome with the MC Hammer dance

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll I like Syndra's dance the most - followed closely by Ahri. No SNSD bias here.

&gt;##4. What's your favorite item?

&gt;&gt;    /u/Jaraxo Heart of Gold. Seriously

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll Liandry's Torment on AP Teemo.

&gt;##5. What's your favorite skin?

&gt;&gt;    /u/Jaraxo Anyone who doesn't say Armour of the 5th Age Taric is a liar.

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll Armor of the Fifth Age Taric ;D

&gt;##6. Do you ever summon things in real life?

&gt;&gt;    /u/Jaraxo [Yes.](http://i.imgur.com/qx2ki.gif)

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll Only small woodland creatures when I sing in the shower

&gt;##7. LoL is a pretty popular competitive game

&gt;&gt;    /u/Jaraxo Some of it

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll Of course! League and eSports are two peas in the same pod! I feel like you can't even get the full experience of LoL without following the competitive scene anymore. (Also FeaR/CLG EU #1)

&gt;##8. What's your favorite K-Pop song (and don't act like you don't know)?

&gt;&gt;    /u/Jaraxo Gotta be [this](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa098s_girls-generation-sorry-sorry-live-a_music#.UOS9pG82ZoM) one.

&gt;&gt;   /u/Glyceroll [Lipstick - Orange Caramel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-d8EYwmdWA) // [Hoot - SNSD](http://youtu.be/F4-SxcCO5d0?t=33s) // [Nobody - Wonder Girls](http://youtu.be/BA7fdSkp8ds?t=2m4s). Once again there's way too many to list them all!

&gt;##9. Do you have anything you'd like to say?

[Kerbal Space Program is a video game by Squad](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/) that places you in charge of designing and building rocket ships. Using a myriad of stock parts, space planes, satellites, rovers, and just about anything else. Hell, you can even make boats if you're determined enough. There's more to it than just building stuff, though; Kerbal Space Program represents human ingenuity. Despite being in alpha, the top dog

Kerbal Space Program is special to me. I started playing only a few short days ago, and though I've travelled millions of miles through space, I feel like I've only barely touched the sky. There's so much to do and see that I doubt I'll ever get it all done. And after so many years, I feel like my search for a real sandbox game is finally over.

However, lots of failures, and *lots* of tinkering. Not everyone can laugh at their own defeat, and fewer still can do it for hours or days on end. I don't fault anyone who does not enjoy KSP, and though I feel they're missing out, I can understand their reasoning. I feel I must say this to hold on to any shred of objectivity I once had, but here it goes: KSP is not perfect, though spectacularly nerdy folks who live by the creed of ""Power, you will be welcomed.

I'm responsible for the subreddit's CSS and I co-manage the Weekly Challenge with Avionaught (this includes designing challenges, and have become very involved with the community. Recently I became a member of the experimental test team, which has given me an opportunity to help out this project that means so much to me.

&gt;&gt;**AvioNaught** Hi! I’m Avionaught and am the most recent addition to the team. I started moderating about 3 months ago when the subreddit was asking for some new volunteers

&gt;&gt;**zzorga** I'm zzorga

&gt;#2. Lots of new players are coming to KSP nowadays. What tips would you give them?

&gt;&gt;**PandaElDiablo** I would encourage new users to stick with the game. The more time you put into the game, but when you finally get a grasp of orbital mechanics and learn how to travel to other worlds, the game becomes an absolute thrill. The learning curve is unbelievably steep, and it takes time to create a successful space program, but I encourage all new users to persevere and truly enjoy the game. Everyone here is ready and willing to help, so don't hesitate to ask for it!

&gt;&gt;**AvioNaught** Tutorials are your friends. There are really good articles on the wiki

&gt;&gt;**zzorga** To all the new players, some people have built helicopters, in a game without propellers! Get creative!

&gt;#3. Rocket science shmocket shmience. KSP can't really be that fun

&gt;&gt;**Fllambe** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFX5kZMulu0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cb5tFSD7dQ Enough said.

&gt;&gt;**PandaElDiablo** Words can't describe how fun this game is. Having played this game for so long, but don't take our word for it. There is a free demo available which offers you everything you would need to decide whether or not KSP is the game for you. For me, I was hooked after my first flight disastrous explosion. You can download the demo on any system at https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/download.php

&gt;&gt;**AvioNaught** This game is something else. I bought it well over a year ago and it has not gotten stale since. I still remember my first ever Mun landing and the hundreds of hours I’ve put into going around the solar system. This is ~~easily one of~~ the most rewarding game I have ever played. I’ve learned a lot from it too

&gt;&gt;**zzorga** You see a small speck on your screen, there's tons of crud on your screen, but this dot is moving. So you build a rocket and you set it's course into the deep regions of the system, and after guiding it, carefully, you see that speck, is more that just dust

&gt;#4. The future of KSP looks as bright as Kerbol. What's next in the game's roadmap?

&gt;&gt;**PandaElDiablo** Although none of the mods here are extensively involved with the development process, the devs have adopted what they are calling a ""content pass"" strategy, where they are first implementing all the major features in their most basic form with the intention of polishing them/finishing them later on. For example, EVAs (spacewalks) now only allow you to exit your craft, walk/jetpack around, and plant flags. Eventually you will be able to repair crafts and collect resources on spacewalks. This should give you an idea of how the development process is working at this point.

&gt;&gt;**AvioNaught** We here do not know more than the rest of the community

&gt;#5. Thanks a ton

&gt;&gt;**Fllambe** We wouldn't be where we are now without the great community that we have. A big thank you to everyone on /r/KerbalSpaceProgram and the community as a whole! :) And thank you to /r/SubredditOfTheDay for the feature!

&gt;&gt;**PandaElDiablo** Like Fllambe said, Squad, and KSP to thank for that. I hope you'll all try out and enjoy the game!

&gt;&gt;**AvioNaught** I do, least trolling, and most creative bunch of people I’ve seen packed into one place. I would also like to thank the guys and gals over at Squad for being a part of our reddit community and sending us updates and working with us, the mods. And in the words of a popular guy ‘round here: fly safe!

&gt;&gt;**zzorga** Just remember which end goes down

Thank you again to the mods of /r/KerbalSpaceProgram for their time and answers.

That about sums it up for today. If you're interested in watching some kerbal fun with your ol' pal Xavier, [my blog](http://xaviermendel.com/).

You know when you are watching tv and [the most ridiculous commercial starts?](http://i.imgur.com/Mzbb0.gif) A [contrived situation](http://i.imgflip.com/55mj.gif)

You shake your head. But then you start to think: that was actually unintentionally hilarious. Like watching [impromptu Parkour.](http://i.imgur.com/IwNo1.gif)

One day on /r/funny a brilliant notion was put forth: [a subreddit dedicated out of context commercials.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11vonv/oh_no_it_poured_right_into_the_glass_like_it_was/c6q2vv3?context=5) Moments later,000 redditors sat there pondering the question: [Where did that goddamn soda go anyway?](http://i.imgur.com/IBN2l.gif)

This subreddit was founded to explore that question! But the science doesn't stop there. [Mechanical/Civil Engineering,](http://i.imgur.com/6WWg1.gif?2) and [Computer Science](http://i.imgur.com/Z28Ou.gif) are all explored in depth. 

I spoke with the moderators to determine [where they think the soda went.](http://www.gifmash.com/autoblog/mammary-mondays-soda-is-great.gif)

&gt; This subreddit is young but massive. Please explain how this was achieved.

&gt;&gt; **robotwarlordelephant :** The amount of subscribers, and general community astounds us all daily. A month ago I posted a silly gif from an advertisement onto /r/funny and left, not expecting anything. A few hours later, biurb had started this subreddit from requests in the comment section, and from the start it was super popular. A great mod community had already been started, and every time you refreshed there were 50 more subscribers.

&gt;&gt; Quickly a set of rules was put up, too. The first few days were key to maintaining the subreddit and making sure that new, quality content was provided.

&gt;&gt; I believe that the rapid growth to this subreddit should be credited to two groups. One, to all of the subscribers that upvote, comment, and post things they want to see, and report stuff they don't. These are the people that keep /r/wheredidthesodago great!

&gt; What do the moderators of /r/wheredidthesodago do?

&gt;&gt; **reemusk:** Our mods do many things. o85 is our CSS guy, and remove content that doesn't fit the sub. We do our best to let the users control what they want to see with up or downvotes. We do our best to try and answer modmails as quick as possible.

&gt;&gt; We also giggle like asian schoolgirls when a post hits /r/All

&gt;&gt; Lastly, all to appease the omnipotent god that is Billy Mays. We then enjoy cookies and freshly sliced tomoatoes.

&gt; A lot of the content on this subreddit is moderator-generated. What kind of things are you doing to encourage subscriber submissions?

&gt;&gt; **gugulo:** Currently our greatest contributor is /u/birchesaintshit [+9].

&gt;&gt; She isn't one of the original moderators

&gt;&gt; But yes,wtf,season,etc...).

&gt;&gt; Currently the prizes are flairs

&gt; Any words for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**birchesaintshit:** Oh man. I love this community so much.. I wish there was a never ending supply of content that was easy to find

&gt;&gt;But its definitely been harder to find the content now more than ever AND I haven't had much time to look. I'm sure theres more. We have to dig deeper yo. I think I've watched more infomercials during this time than in my whole life. Its crazy.

&gt;&gt;I've got asked a good ten times if I watch infomercials all day. No

[StarCraft is a real time strategy game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft) developed by Blizzard which takes place in the 25th century and centers around [3 species fighting for dominance](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/1219124/starcraft-gameplay-o.gif) in a distant area of the galaxy; [Terrans](http://www.foro3d.com/attachments/95482d1235243098-marine-starcraft-2-531239034_b782e4f173.jpg) (humans),](http://i.imgur.com/l6Zenyv.gif) where a player will need to complete a specific objective in order to continue the storyline, and PvP/PvE, where a player will battle either another player or a scalable AI. Much of the game's community discussion focuses on PvP between professional players. StarCraft is a global phenomenon; Battle.net, Blizzards online multiplayer service coordinates games between players from [Belgium](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Belgian_SC2_Community) to Bhutan. South Korea is particularly interested in StarCraft, with millions of dollars in prizes for competition wins up for grabs.

StarCraft was originally released on March 31, StarCraft 2: Wings Of Liberty. Today Blizzard released StarCraft 2: Heart Of The Swarm, the 2nd release of the StarCraft 2 Trilogy. The third installment, StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void, supposedly remains in development however news is spotty. 

/r/StarCraft is a fabulous StarCraft resource and community. This subreddit has featured interviews with the developers, as well as redditor tournaments, discussion of live events, and even beta key giveaways. /r/starcraft has also experienced its share of drama. /u/Firi (subreddit creator) recounts the epic tale of the third year of /r/StarCraft [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/StarcraftArchives/comments/14dssa/rstarcraft_turns_three_years_old_today/) (captured by davidjayhawk for posterity.) 

I started playing StarCraft regularly in 2010, so you don't have to be worried that you will never win again. Some people find it easier and less intense to simply play against the far more predictable AI. This will test your macro ability and army position, since the AI usually stays away from cheese tactics and all ins. I find this matchup to be relaxing; if you aren't able to commit hours per day to video games then you can enjoy a couple of fun ten minute games per day against the AI to work on your macro and release stress. On the other hand if you love to watch the game but don't have time to play Starcraft 2 is one of the main events at MLG. You can watch some of the best players in the world battle it out for cash prizes. So much pressure! Other options exist, such as players streaming games on Twitch.tv, or YouTube replays by [professional commentators](http://i.imgur.com/LVodAXm.png) like [Day9](http://i.imgur.com/bph8wiA.jpg) and [Husky.](http://i.imgur.com/6jABvq1.jpg)

I spoke with the moderators to learn more:

&gt; What is your starcraft background?

&gt;&gt;**robhoward:** My flatmate in university introduced me to Starcraft 2 as a spectator sport during the first GSL Open Season, but since the GSL Open Season 2 finals between Nestea and Foxer I've been hooked.

&gt;&gt;**retrac1324:** I played StarCraft 1 only a few times but not very much. I played other RTS games like Command &amp; Conquer and Age of Empires. I started playing StarCraft II in 2010 a bit after it was released. Since then

&gt;&gt;**davidjayhawk:** A long time ago a friend of mine showed me WarCraft (yes WarCraft

&gt;&gt;**khalid066:** I knew about StarCraft but I wasn't really into it until I saw the [Day[9] Daily #100](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJztfsXKcPQ) which made it pretty high on reddit. I bought SC2 after I saw that and convinced a friend to buy it too.

&gt;&gt;**jevon:** A Canadian friend snail mailed me a copy of Starcraft 1 and we'd play Big Game Hunters maps over dialup

&gt;&gt;**CandyManCan:** I have been playing Starcraft since 1998 mostly as a hobby/group activity. I managed to achieve ICCUP C- a few times

&gt;&gt;**SoleReaver:** I was introduced to StarCraft vanilla by my Korean friend in middle school and played it for several years. Once StarCraft 2 beta came out

&gt;&gt;**KingKrapp:** I got into SC2 relatively late (pretty much bang on 2 years ago), so I introduced him to the concept of esports. We both got hooked, ruining our sleep schedules to watch European tournaments, and playing 2v2s together. I actually had to upgrade our internet download quota on 3 separate occasions because I was watching so much. Now I have a yearly GSL ticket, we're getting a new TV so that we can watch it in the living room, and I'm subbed and following a number of Twitch channels. I'm still awful at playing, though.

&gt;&gt;**DarkAutumn:** This one: http://goodbyegames.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/starcraft-2-loading-screen.jpg

&gt; Who is your favourite pro? Ever been to a MLG event?

&gt;&gt;**robhoward:** Since MarineKing captured my interest in that nail biting final of GSL Open Season 2 I'd have to say he is my favourite Korean pro.

&gt;&gt; I've never been to a MLG but I met Demuslim at WCS UK and he was a pretty cool dude so I'd say he's my favourite international player.

&gt;&gt;**retrac1324:** I have a lot of favorite pros, Taeja, ThorZain, Nestea, MC, GuMiho, Bomber

&gt;&gt;**davidjayhawk:** I have a hard time picking a single favorite pro. I guess I'll go with Sheth

&gt;&gt;**khalid066:** My favorite pro is MC. From his casting at Homestory Cup to his GSL celebrations

&gt;&gt; I have not been to any esports events unfortunately but I do hope to go to one soon.

&gt;&gt;**jevon:** Thorzain, I live in NZ... I will make it one day.

&gt;&gt;**CandyManCan:** My favorite pro would have to be MC, visiting MLG would be difficult, through I am planning a trip to watch a GSL finals.

&gt;&gt;**SoleReaver:** My favorite would be WhiteRa with TLO being a close second. I went to MLG DC way back in the day (2010) but haven't been to one since due to proximity issues mainly (though I've attended other events).

&gt;&gt;**KingKrapp:** It's hard to go past Stephano. Lot of talent

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately I live in Australia

&gt;&gt;**DarkAutumn:** Easily JP McDaniels.

&gt; What is your favourite /r/starcraft submission?

&gt;&gt;**robhoward:** I'm a big fan of the survival guide posts made by our users ([OftenSarcastic](http://www.reddit.com/user/OftenSarcastic/submitted/) in particular) for tournaments and events. They often do a better job than the websites of the tournaments at making it easy to find all the information you need to enjoy them.

&gt;&gt;**retrac1324:** There's a lot but [Ostojiy's Reactive Guide to Zerg vs Terran](http://www.itsgosu.com/game/sc2/articles/ostojiy-s-reactive-zerg-guide_866) was a pretty awesome contribution considering everyone's been waiting for it for so long and it's 11

&gt;&gt;**davidjayhawk:** [REInvestor's beginner's guide to improving at StarCraft 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/lf73b/my_beginners_guide_to_improving_at_starcraft_2/) It may be getting slightly dated now but there's still so much good information in there.

&gt;&gt;**khalid066:** Favorite submission would probably have to be the [send Marine King to MLG Orlando](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/khnfz/chipin_marinekingprime_to_mlg_orlando/) post. It was really cool to see the community send MKP to an MLG.

&gt;&gt;**jevon:** [Probably this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/uy4gj/dustin_browder_watches_starcraft/) :DD I prefer discussion over fluff though.

&gt;&gt;**CandyManCan:** I don't have a paticular favourite submission

&gt;&gt;**SoleReaver:** Honestly I love a lot of the user-created content on here

&gt;&gt;**KingKrapp:** There are a LOT of posts on this sub

&gt;&gt;**DarkAutumn:** No contest: http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/

&gt; Does /r/starcraft have rules?

&gt;&gt;**robhoward:** Despite what the vocal minority would have you believe - [yes!](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/w/rules)

&gt;&gt; We stick to them quite strictly and they are rigorously enforced!

&gt;&gt;**retrac1324:** Yes

&gt;&gt; We understand that there is a lot of content that users may not care to see so we have been using a content-tagging system that allows users to filter the types of posts we see. This makes it so that we do not have to prevent users from things such as posting spoilers or stream links. For the most part

&gt;&gt;**davidjayhawk:** [Yes we do](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/w/rules)

&gt;&gt;**CandyManCan:** Yes. All were formulated by the community or with considerable community input and usually after considerable discussion by mods internally.

&gt;&gt;**KingKrapp:** Nah man

&gt;&gt; Seriously

&gt; What do you think of Heart Of The Swarm? Do you prefer it over Wings of Liberty?

&gt;&gt;**robhoward:** The next MLG

&gt;&gt;**retrac1324:** I've played around on the beta for fun and there are definitely a few things in particular I like. The new physics/graphics engine, and cool aspects like Medivac speed boost and new units makes the game more interesting. Time will tell but I like the way it's looking.

&gt;&gt;**davidjayhawk:** Personally I do prefer it if only for the selfish reason that high level players have to worry about all the tough issues such as adjusting builds and balance concerns while I get to enjoy fresh game-play and strange strategies while it's being figured out.

&gt;&gt;**khalid066:** I prefer HOTS

&gt;&gt;**jevon:** I love it. The interface is slick and fast and polished like the original SC UI

&gt;&gt;**CandyManCan:** I think HOTS is too new to make any judgements about its metagame or balance issues, similar to what Riot is doing with the LWC, as I feel this would be an golden opportunity to establish that SC2 is a premier RTS and not a competitor to MOBAs such as DoTA 2 or LoL and that you can be a player and supporter of both games simultaneously (like me!).

&gt;&gt;**SoleReaver:** In my opinion, resume from replay, group replay viewing, etc.), but I haven't had enough time to play HoTS to determine if the game play is ""better"" than WoL. My feeling is that it will be, however.

&gt;&gt;**KingKrapp:** HotS seems really cool right now! Watching the FFAs and TB's House of the Swarm tournament has gotten me very keen to see what the larger community will do with it. Do I prefer it? I'm not sure. I like it more right now

&gt;&gt;**DarkAutumn:** They definitely seemed to have tightened up the graphics on level 3

&gt; Any messages for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**robhoward:** We're always open to constructive feedback so feel free to send us modmail.

&gt;&gt; Onward to 200

&gt;&gt;**retrac1324:** Thanks for being such an enthusiastic and passionate community and I look forward to everything to come in the future.

&gt;&gt;**davidjayhawk:** Thank you to all of the great community members who contribute content, links, and everything else that has helped to make StarCraft a phenomenon.

&gt;&gt;**khalid066:** You guys are awesome!

&gt;&gt;**jevon:** &lt;33 Thank you for creating such an amazing community.

&gt;&gt;**CandyManCan:** glhf.

&gt;&gt;**SoleReaver:** Thanks for all the great content over the years! Looking forward to many years to come.

&gt;&gt;**KingKrapp:** You guys are great!

&gt;&gt;**DarkAutumn:** I like turtles.

Your comments and your downvotes have been received and we are all aware of your discontent with how things have been at Subreddit of the Day.  I am here to apologize to you all.  I was the one who decided we should choose larger subreddits, and I'm very sorry.

Subreddit of the Day began as a creative writing project.  As a backstory, but we never missed a day.  More importantly, everyone on the mod team always gave 100% when they could or found coverage when they were in a jam.  I never imagined I'd have such dedicated friends.  Hell, my real life friends wouldn't do a fraction of the favours these guys and gals do.  It's mind boggling - I can't explain it, but I'm deeply touched at their dedication.

One year later, a day of shining a spotlight on subreddits, well it just turned angry and nasty.  So, having heard your remarks, your criticisms and your input, I offer my apologies.  ~~We're taking a break to get this ship back upright... Subreddit of the Day will return on Monday, May 28th

NO ONE CAN FORGET THIS SONG.

Pokemon is the greatest thing ever! When the pokemon craze hit my town, games and learning more and more! I even used to import cards from the US and Japan to have a better collection than my friends hahaha! 

If you dont know what pokemon are &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; then its basically special animals with special powers who lived aside humans in the world. They can be caught by the trainers and trainers battle each other out to become the [*World's greatest pokemon master EVER!*](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/231/5/d/pokemon_master_red_by_2d75-d473gi1.jpg)

The story started in pallet town where my favourite trainer

If i could ever catch a pokemon it would be [Charmander (*Rawr*)](http://images.wikia.com/pokemon-svke/images/d/d4/Charmander.gif). Why ? thats because pokemon evolve into powerful forms as the go ahead and charmander evolves finally into [CHARIZARD!](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/21700000/Charizard-charizard-21791996-650-465.png) The GREATEST

Pokemon is way more than a cartoon. It teaches us the value of friendship, the beauty of love and more than ever the meaning of following our dreams!

So i am here with the team of /r/pokemon to have an amazing interview and look what they have to say!

&gt;##1. How were you introduced to the world of pokémon?
&gt;&gt;**Failcake:** I started playing Pokemon on my Gameboy Color when I was pretty young, I begged my parents for a Gameboy and a copy of Pokemon, which they eventually obliged.  
**light_twin:** My first experience with Pokémon was probably when the first season of the show was airing on TV. I remember I definitely saw the first episode. I liked it so much that I'd wake up early every Saturday morning just to watch it. The video games
**Hypobasis:** I stole my sisters gameboy and borrowed my cousins copy of Gold for like three months. I loved the game nearly right away.  
**The_Antigamer:** Started playing red back in early grade school

&gt;##2. What's your favourite pokémon and why?
&gt;&gt;**Failcake:** Blastoise is the best Pokemon ever. Because he's a turtle
**light_twin:** Leafeon! All of the Eeveelutions seem to be pretty popular among Pokémon fans
**Hypobasis:** My favorite pokemon is Electabuzz
**The_Antigamer:** Honchkrow. It's a combination of a mafisio boss and a bird


&gt;##3. Have you played any pokémon game(s)? If yes
&gt;&gt;**Failcake:** I've played and beaten every generation of Pokemon games. The first starter I ever took was Charmander
**light_twin:** I've played at least one game from each generation of the handheld games: Blue, Silver, Ruby, Pearl, and White. Ever since I was young I'd always pick the fire type, so I started with Charmander, which eventually became the ever popular ""Level 100 Charizard"" some people get pretty nostalgic over. As far as console games: Pokémon Stadium 1+2, Pokémon Colosseum
**Hypobasis:** First was Pokemon gold
**The_Antigamer:** I've played 'em all, this is nostalgia-ing me. That first rattata wasn't an annoying loser, it was mine, my pokemon, and I trained it with my team. I didn't know any better, I just knew I had to treat my pokemon right. Now the only time I ever catch a rattata when not nuzlocking is to stuff it in the computer for completion sakes.


&gt;##4. Who do you think is the hottest girl in Pokémon? :D
&gt;&gt;**Failcake:** It would be very pedo-ish of me to say one of the main characters since they're all technically ten years old. So I'll have to say Officer Jenny. However
**light_twin:** I don't know about hottest lol. I think May is probably the cutest. Misty is still pretty cool though.  
**Hypobasis:** Misty
**The_Antigamer:** Can't beat that childhood crush on Misty.



&gt;##5. Pokémon has changed over the years. Do you think it's become better or not? Please explain how.  
&gt;&gt;**Failcake:** I like the fact that Pokemon has evolved into a type of game where the most casual players can get into it and enjoy the game, etc.). Although I do think there may be too many Pokemon at this point. Especially Nosepass. It's a Pokemon whose main feature is its nose. I mean, come on, really?  
**light_twin:** I haven't been keeping up too much with the show, I can definitely say that the games continue to improve. While they still follow the basic formula of 8 gyms and an Elite Four, the handheld games continue to get more new features and graphical updates. If you compare the Red or Blue to Black or White, the games have evolved tremendously. We went from only being able to trade and battle with friends locally via link cable to doing the same thing wirelessly over the internet with anyone worldwide. The graphics have gone from flat and grasycale to practically 3D, full color graphics. With things like the Pokéwalker and the Dreamworld, the games have become more than just something you play on your DS.  
Overall
**Hypobasis:** I don't think its changes much over the years. Its the same, more moves, more types, more items. The general gameplay itself is pretty much the same.  
I believe its gotten better. Its for sure a lot more interesting due to the new combinations of pokemon and items. Could it be better? Yeah. Is it cool right now? For sure.  
**The_Antigamer:** In a lot of ways it has, just adding a new gizmo and 200-odd more 'mons and calling it a day. There's so much potential in the pokemon universe. I think B&amp;W was a step in the right direction, but I don't think B&amp;W2 will be another step forward. 


&gt;##6. Do you have anything to say to your present and future users?  
&gt;&gt;**Failcake:** The mods are very nice and don't bite. Well
**light_twin:** Of course I'd like to thank the /r/Pokemon community for being so awesome! And for anyone out there who feels embarrassed or ashamed to say they like Pokémon
**Hypobasis:** Have fun bros!  
**The_Antigamer:** Stop using the report button as a dislike button

/r/TheLastAirbender is a subreddit focused on the original animation, come on, a white kid... as a Chinese monk? REALLY? That dude had one job. ONE. Cast the right kids and redo the cartoon with live action and explosions. Even Michael Bay pulled off Transformers. The cartoon was basically a story board in a gift basket... how could you honestly fuck up something that easy? I'll tell you how, re-tar-dation. Someone give that guy 10 or so shots of morphine... pretty please.

So lets talk little about the first series. Avatar: The Last AirBender. Its a journey of action and adventure that spans 3 *Books* or seasons. Aang, water, earth &amp; fire](http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/2727/tdd2vd0.gif). With accurate fighting styles, light comedy, and deep characters. You and your whole family will be hooked from the first episode. 

Now on to the latest series. Avatar: The Legend of Korra. This series is set at a much later time than the first series. Many of the main cast from the first series are [dead due to the time span](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2o1lx0FAC1rs30kho1_500.gif) between the two series. But fear not

Overall, the drama, the characters... all first class. 

~~I hadn't gotten the chance to ask the mods any questions yet

The Q &amp; A is finally here!

&gt;1. Who is your favorite ""late comer"" character from ""Avatar: The last air bender"". Why?

&gt;&gt;**zuko_for_firelord** I really didn't understand the question. By ""late comer"" character do you mean character who didn't show up until well into the series? If so, and fights him to a draw. The creators thought she was so overpowered, so they nerfed her with blindness. And even while blind, she still kicks ass. So, the best character introduced late in the series, hands down 10/10 Toph Bei-Fong.

&gt;&gt;**HeirToPendragon** Well for Avatar there aren't a lot of characters that showed up late and actually stayed around. But if we were to pick one of them

&gt;&gt;**thecabbagemerchant** Definitely Azula

&gt;&gt;**azntonyboi11111** I love toph. I always get goosebumps when I watch the blind bandit episode. She is an amazing earthbender and she has a very tough

&gt;&gt;**Polack14** Best late comer has to be Toph. She is beyond badass. She invents a new style of bending and has more mastery over earthbending at 12 than any bender in the world.

&gt;&gt;**biganthony** The Foggy Swamp Tribe (all of them)

&gt;&gt;**FoamingMouthGuy**  I have a hard time just picking one favorite ""late-comer"" character. All the characters in the show are just so well created! If I narrowed it down, period.

&gt;2. How did you get hooked on the series?


&gt;&gt;**zuko_for_firelord** I watched the series as a child when it was airing on Nickelodeon

&gt;&gt;**HeirToPendragon** I remember hearing about in on the internet at one point and downloaded the series. From there I just couldn't get enough. The writing was solid

&gt;&gt;**thecabbagemerchant** When I was twelve years old

&gt;&gt;**azntonyboi11111** The first episode I ever watched was The King of Omashu on television. I really enjoyed the episode because of King Bumis tests and trickery. I decided to watch the rest of the show online and it was just mindblowingly good.

&gt;&gt;**Polack14** I remember seeing commercials for the show before it aired on Nick and started watching from the beginning. I was pretty much hooked instantly after that.

&gt;&gt;**biganthony** The freshness it had to it when it first aired.

&gt;&gt;**FoamingMouthGuy** How did I get hooked? Well


&gt;3. Is The Legend Of Korra

&gt;&gt;**zuko_for_firelord** Many of my friends disagree with me, and the HD really gives an awesome effect on the viewer. Comparably to the original series, Korra is definitely more mature, dark, and fast-paced, partly because of only a two season limit and partly because the target audience has grown up. Legend of Korra to me is off to an infinitely better start than ATLA, but only future episodes will tell if that streak continues.

&gt;&gt;**HeirToPendragon** TLOK is, the show is much faster paced. The animation has definitely gotten even better and is some of the best on television right now. Also, the theme of the show is just so much better. In the first series they brought up a lot of moral questions for the characters to face, and that has passed on completely to this new show. The villain is a terrorist, but his message is actually morally questionable and has led to great discussion of whether or not he is, well, ""right"". This new series is darker and much more mature.

&gt;&gt;**thecabbagemerchant** The Legend of Korra, which is very hard when your predecessor won a Peabody! While there are less episodes, there is also less filler and each episode is jam-packed with plot. But we can only truly judge the two once this season ends and we see the full story.

&gt;&gt;**azntonyboi11111** Right now its too early to tell. I feel like the entire TLA series as a whole is what makes it a masterpiece, fighting moves, and Pabu.

&gt;&gt;**Polack14** Oh TLOK is totally living up to expectations! Its more condensed than Avatar: The Last Airbender, everything is top notch.

&gt;&gt;**biganthony** Yes it opened up a new view to the world of the avatar that the previous story and characters simply could not have delivered.

&gt;&gt;**FoamingMouthGuy** The Legend of Korra is definitely living up to A:TLA's glory! It's animation and art direction is top notch. The production value of each episode is extremely high

&gt;4. If you could bend any one element

&gt;&gt;**zuko_for_firelord** For this question let's assume that I am a master at whatever I'm supposed to be bending. In that case, heating and cooling water, pulling water out of thin air and other resources around you, water bending can be one of the most versatile forms of fighting. Not to mention it would help with cooking dinner.

&gt;&gt;**HeirToPendragon** I'd choose Air

&gt;&gt;**thecabbagemerchant** Airbending

&gt;&gt;**azntonyboi11111** I would definitely be a waterbender . I feel that water is the most versatile element. The ability to heal is often overlooked and is very useful. Also

&gt;&gt;**Polack14** I would be an airbender no doubt. They seemed like very easygoing people and who wouldnt want to be able to fly??

&gt;&gt;**biganthony** Air

&gt;&gt;**FoamingMouthGuy** I'm a foam bender

&gt;5. Open Mic: say what you want

&gt;&gt;**zuko_for_firelord** Our subreddit has exploded in numbers over the past two months. If you take a look at our recent [traffic and numbers](http://redditlist.com/stats/TheLastAirbender),000 subscriber celebration, and the Legend of Korra is in full swing. I am extremely grateful to have been made a mod of my favorite subreddit, allowing me to help make sure that this subreddit doesn't go the same way as some other large subreddits. See [Eternel September.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) I just want to say thank you for having us on /r/subredditoftheday and I hope to be a part of this wonderful subreddit for a very long time.

&gt;&gt;**HeirToPendragon** When dextre and I created this subreddit, all the hours spent inputting flair and thinking up ideas to make this subreddit more active, and it feels so very worth it at this point. A month ago I added 5 more mods to help us out and I am so glad I did, because there is no way I could handle all this by myself now.

&gt;&gt; Also

&gt;&gt;**thecabbagemerchant** I just want to say, whenever the occasion. But soon I began taking a more active role in this subreddit, back when we had maybe one or two new posts a day. As we began to grow with anticipation for LOK, /u/HeirToPendragon sought me out and made me a mod. I didn't even ask for the job! I want to thank him personally, for without him this subreddit would be nothing.

&gt;&gt;**azntonyboi11111** Thanks a lot for choosing us as the SROTD! The pace which we're growing is rediculous and we have an awesome community.

&gt;&gt;**Polack14** I think its amazing to see how many people are in love with this show and this subreddit really has been a crucible for them to come together and discuss theories and share their favorite moments from these two amazing series.

&gt;&gt;**biganthony** I don't have much to say just I hope this community grows and allows the fans to communicate and have fun!

&gt;&gt;**FoamingMouthGuy** This is a shout out to the Animation/Illustration students and faculty at SJSU. You guys all rock!! Play Dungeons &amp; Dragons with me. FLAMEO /r/THELASTAIRBENDER!!!

####Writer's Note

First off, really loves doing what he does. Your whining and complaining really messed with him and I'll never forget you asses for that. *I* knew featuring /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu would be controversial but it caught /u/Srotd by surprise. Unlike him, I love fucking with people... cause thats who I am, I'm a rebel without a cause, an asshole with time on his hands and a true symbol of ~~capitalist greed~~ cronyism. /u/Srotd is none of these things. Thats why when the shit storm hit he was really affected by it and I was like nothing happened. You all should be lucky mods like him exist, maybe a little thank note his way would be well deserved. He didn't have to give an apology, yet he did. Why? Cause he cares. Fuck you for thinking anyone of us owes you shit. We don't and if you don't like it, shut the fuck up and read the god damn intro + interview like good boys and girls.

Back in the olden days, oldest movie theater showed free movies for kids. Near Halloween it might be Midnite Marathons of [Vincent Price](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmgAsLr2bgI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=11s) or Planet of the Apes movies that ended promply at 9 and just before Christmas they'd play movies like [Pippi Longstocking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIS7WXrNqU) or ones that would later be [MST3000'd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnEJrwYXXsI).

They'd open up the usually off limits balconies and cram 100s of unsupervised seven to eleven year-olds into the grimy

It was awesome! I looked forward to it every year

I have not had that kind of feeling since

 &gt;A good chunk of those movies I wouldn't watch on any other terms

This is not to say that the only full free movies on /r/fullmoviesonyoutube are of questionable quality

[Eraserhead](http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/1462if/eraserhead_david_lynch/); [Help](http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/1490sf/help_1965/); Charlie Chaplin's [The Little Dictator](http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/13gxyu/charles_chaplin_the_great_dictator_1940_youtube/); Monty Python's [Life of Brian in German](http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/13g36t/monty_pythons_life_of_brian_das_leben_des_brian/); [ToyStory 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/14viet/toy_story_3_2010_hd/) and more!

I dragged myself away from youtube just barely long enough to talk with the mods and here's what they had to say about their helpful



&gt;##1. I love free things that require nothing on my part to access them! How did this subreddit come into existence?

&gt;&gt;**coolerheadprevails** [This is the post that started it all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13fgbb/enjoy_yourselves_tmnt_1990_full/c73lwf9)

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** I'll let /u/coolerheadprevails answer that one.

&gt;&gt;**herecomethedrums** Our creator and master Coolerheadprevails created it for full movies on youtube!

&gt;##2.What would you like new subscribers to know about your sub?

&gt;&gt;**coolerheadprevails** I would like new subscribers to know that I created this subreddit to make things easier on them. I did not create this subreddit to combat other subreddits or to become the most powerful subreddit out there. This subreddit is strictly for people who want to watch movies without worrying about 30 second ads every 10 minutes you watch of a movie, polls or any of the other crap sites try to push on it's users. When you come to this subreddit you just press play and watch. It's that simple.

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** If you find a dead link

&gt;&gt;**herecomethedrums** That it's completely free

&gt;##3.Are there any important rules newcomers should know before submitting to the sub?

&gt;&gt;**coolerheadprevails** I like newcomers that are thinking about submitting to know that though I am very lenient and even though I make exceptions with things that can be posted please do not ask me to bend the rules specifically for you. If I let one person bend the rules then I have to let everybody else do it. This is my first time creating a subreddit and I'm still learning how to run things. Please follow the rules to make things easier on me and the moderators.

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** Before you post a movie, this subreddit is for links to YouTube only, any other links, self posts, etc. will be removed.

&gt;&gt;**herecomethedrums** Yes, and don't try and whore subscribers from us. 

&gt;##4.I've already watched a bunch of free full length movies that I've found on your sub. Which ones have you watched?

&gt;&gt;**coolerheadprevails** Most recent? Boyz In The Hood. I've watched that movie a million times and I still can't get over what they did to Ricky. Why did he have to run in a straight line? Why couldn't he just run in a zig-zag? We might've had a sequel.

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** I've seen most of the ones that I like already so I haven't really watched many on the subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**herecomethedrums** I have uploaded 79 movies. 2012

&gt;##5. What free movie are you most excited about that has been posted?

&gt;&gt;**coolerheadprevails** Expendables 2. The reason being that was my first time uploading anything to Youtube

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** The Amazing Spiderman was posted recently

&gt;&gt;**herecomethedrums** Hackers. I like it.

&gt;##6. Is there anything you would like to add or promote? Any questions I should have asked?

&gt;&gt;**coolerheadprevails** This is more than enough promotion. Big thanks to you and the rest of the mods for choosing us to be Subreddit Of The Day! Another thanks goes out to our current subscribers and anybody that ends up subscribing to us after reading this.

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** Not that I can think of

&gt;&gt;**herecomethedrums** Not really

Full free movies on YouTube could come in handy this holiday season. Watch with family or to get a break away from said family! Watch them all year long

Happy Holidays!

**New visitors please be kind and follow the sub's guidelines!**

Ever wondered how earth will look like in a thousand years? Even better: ever wondered how earth will look like in a thousand years, and good news. 

Futurama is an awesome cartoon about a guy called Fry, Nixon as president and many other sci-fi stuff come along his path as a delivery boy. 

You may think this subreddit is a bit too big to get nominated
To compromise stuff

So qweiopasd, at your service. *But why not Zoidberg?*. Well, because [Zoidberg is always number 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWoYmTAfDbk). He is so high in ranking that there needed to be a new list below him. And that's where we meet the glorious Zapp Brannigan. His smooth voice and classic battle/[love making tactics](http://i.imgur.com/z4U9y.jpg) beat every other rival. Try to read everything in his voice (even this write up), it makes them even better than a cold icecream on a hot mid-afternoon. 

So please do yourself a favor and go watch this cartoon. 


##I'll hopefully get the answers soon! 

**Until we get the answers I answered hem myself**

&gt;#1. How did you get into Futurama
&gt;&gt; **qweiopasd** I think I first saw it on comedy central

&gt;#2. Who is your favorite character and why?
&gt;&gt;**qweiopasd** Zapp

&gt;#3. What is your favourite quote? And what about your favourite episode?
&gt;&gt;**qweiopasd** So many choices. A lot of my favourite are written in this feature. Bender always gives some good ones. For now I think the Snu-Snu episode

&gt;#4. I see that you are the only mod at r/Futurama
&gt;&gt;**qweiopasd** ERROR

&gt;#5. With many comedy series the viewers often believe that the serie is going downhill. Do you have the same thought about Futurama?
&gt;&gt;**qweiopasd** Well

&gt;#6. How do you think the world will look like in the year 3000?
&gt;&gt;**qweiopasd** As I said in a previous post

&gt;#7. How is the community like?
&gt;&gt;**qweiopasd** pretty awesome. They can be dicks sometimes

&gt;&gt; *They can be dicks sometimes
-qweiopasd

&gt;#8. Anything else you would like to add?
&gt;&gt;**qweiopasd** Go watch the show! Admire me and have a great day.

Last week /u/SaltyChristian and I brought you on a mystical journey to Oregon to meet /r/GravityFalls. This week we journey to [Tyria](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tyria) and talk to the team responsible for /r/Guildwars2. (Not really




I first learned of [Guild Wars 2](http://meta.filesmelt.com/downloader.php?file=spongebob-guild-wars-2.gif) about 6 months ago when I was finally starting to come down off my [2 year Starcraft2 buzz.](http://img.gomtv.net/userimg/0000/0448/48448.jpg) I had never played a [MMORPG ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) before; I had heard all kinds of things about them



What attracted me to Guild Wars 2 was the approach that the developer, Final Fantasy XI, Lord of the Rings Online, and Warhammer Online all require a monthly subscription fee.](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/show/released/sCol/finalRank/sOrder/desc) Being the frugal gamer that I consider myself to be, [I immediately found this attractive.](http://i.imgur.com/XISDF.gif) Other notable features of the game include: Scaling between players of unequal levels to allow for friends at different points in their stories to fight together, and a linear leveling system which aims to kill the [grinding feeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(video_gaming) which many players experience in other MMORPG’s.



[Guild Wars 2 currently ranks #1 on MMORPG’s Gamelist sorted by rating/hype.](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/show/all/sCol/rankHype/sOrder/desc) The game has been in development since March 2007 with the final expansion of the original [Guild Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars) acting as a bridge between the previous release and the new campaign. Beginning in 2009, 2012, although users who had pre-purchased the game got a [3 day head start.](http://i.imgur.com/9Vpf5.gif)



/r/Guildwars2 has been around for more than 2 years and has witnessed the transition from the original Guild Wars into the current release of Guild Wars 2. Then during development, he added Skuld around 6 months ago and then added Deimorz and Automoderator two weeks ago. /r/Guildwars2 boasts [the second highest subscriber/online ratio on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/yev9s/some_initial_horribly_anecdotal_statistics_about/) and continues to flourish in the wake of the release.


After trying to contact the moderators via reddit, we hatched a plan to post a craigslist ad titled ""Woman seeking /r/GuildWars2 moderators."" This proved to be irresistible to them, so [Salty dressed up in a wig and a skirt](http://i.imgur.com/O3FxN.jpg) long enough to spike their drinks and try to get a [memorable quote](http://i.imgur.com/9lf4k.jpg) out of them.


&gt;##1. What is your gaming/MMO background? 

&gt;&gt;**Attunement:** I played the original Guild Wars (started about 6 months after release). Other games I regularly play: Killing Floor, L4D1/2 and F1 2011 to name a few, I'm looking forward to Borderlands 2 and Torchlight 2. In Borderlands 2 I'm going to play [Salvador](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/yj7gn/official_salvador_profile/) and it's going to be amazing.

&gt;&gt;**Skuld:** Guild Wars is my only MMO, but being a lot busier nowadays, I haven't had that luxury. In the interim between Guild Wars 1 &amp; 2, I played a lot of Minecraft.

&gt;&gt;**Deimorz:** I tend to play one game at a time quite obsessively. MMORPG-wise, and a few months on both League of Legends and Diablo III.

&gt;&gt;**AutoModerator:** beep beep

&gt;##2. Who is responsible for the subreddit design? Do you have any changes or improvements coming up?

&gt;&gt;**Attunement:** I started messing around with the style of the subreddit back when it only had 100 subscribers, recently we've added hover boxes to the sidebar and moved the submit button. Improvements are generally added as the ideas get thought up, we do plan on adding better guild support/a decent FAQ when the new wiki system is released though.

&gt;##3.  How excited are you that ArenaNet is taking this subreddit seriously?

&gt;&gt;**Attunement:** ArenaNet have always had a presence on the subreddit

&gt;&gt;**Skuld:** It's great! reddit was not a major player in the days of Guild Wars 1

&gt;&gt;**Deimorz:** I think it's great that they've been engaging with the community directly through reddit, trying to get attention for their support tickets, posting ""Dear ArenaNet"" suggestions, etc.

&gt;&gt;**Automoderator:**  beep 

&gt;##4.  What are your feelings towards the rapid growth of this subreddit and the level of content your users contribute?

&gt;&gt;**Attunement:** We all expected the subreddit to grow once the game was released but I think we were all surprised by the actual amount. In May and June we hit 4.5 and 4.8 million views respectively

&gt;&gt;**Skuld:** The growth has been a fantastic challenge

&gt;&gt;I think we're 36th most active section on the whole site currently. /u/Deimorz 's /u/AutoModerator bot has helped greatly in the moderation of the subreddit

&gt;&gt;Of course there have been some growing pains, but there were some real facepalm-worthy moments with people posting their account names, CD keys, and I think someone posted their password once.

&gt;&gt;**Deimorz:** It's definitely caused a noticeable shift. As I mentioned above, to have a lot of users that aren't ""redditors that play _"", **but** ""_ players that found reddit"".

&gt;##5.  What are your favorite races and professions to play?

&gt;&gt;**Attunement:** I play a Norn Mesmer. The Norn are the best race (They're essentially Vikings who drink excessively and have a lot of facial hair.) The Mesmer is so good other people don't even know it yet..!

&gt;&gt;**Skuld:** I'm having the most fun with Elementalist at the moment, couldn't really be anything else.

&gt;&gt;**Deimorz:** My main character is a Human Thief, and has a lot more survivability than previous things I tried.

&gt;&gt;**AutoModerator:** beep boop

&gt;##6. What does the /r/Guildwars2 community have to offer for new MMORPG players?

&gt;&gt;**Attunement:** The subreddit has been around for a while so we've got loads of resources for new players to search through
Personally I've been taking part in the /r/GW2EU community which is one of the biggest reddit based guilds

&gt;&gt;**Skuld:** A wealth of experience. Guild Wars 2 seems very popular with veteran MMO players, Dark Age of Camelot, EverQuest players talking about their experiences. The community is always very helpful too, any sort of question in /new will always recieve 5-10 replies, though we hope that people will search first.

&gt;&gt;**Deimorz:** There's already a lot of great information geared towards new players that's been posted, since a game wiki often isn't very useful if you don't already know where to look for the information you need.

&gt;##7.  What is your favorite moment in the /r/Guildwars2 community history?

&gt;&gt;**Attunement:** It will have to be when members of the community banded together and raised $3, they sent 400 cupcakes to ArenaNet and the rest went to charity. It was a little surreal as I went to sleep with no mention of a fund raiser anywhere and woke up to $3,690.00 being raised.

&gt;&gt;A big congratulations goes out to /u/Marslo for organising the fund raiser and to everyone who donated.
You can see the initial submission [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/yrn2z/the_great_cup_cake_initiative_ei_colectivly)

&gt;&gt;**Automoderator:**  beep beep boop beep

&gt;&gt;**Skuld:** I'd say the talented people posting their fan-art. I try and give these people a dye bottle flair when I see them

From the desk of 4chan comes yet another trend in greentext stories: fat people stories. They tell the tale of overweight folks doing things that would easily fit in one of the various cringe subreddits. I'm sure I'll draw the ire of many by featuring this subreddit, while a health risk, doesn't harm others. There's no second-hand fat, though I suppose their children might suffer. I'm not a social scientist; indeed, I'm part of the STEM master race. Maybe I just can't understand the problems of overweight people. I'm not really lazy, and have a strict exercise routine. I've never been anything but on the upper spectrum of *awesome.* Still, I can understand the temptation. I love me some beef jerky and nachos.

Let's move away from the covering of my ass and onto the subreddit at hand. /r/fatpeoplestories is what one would call a border subreddit. Let me explain. Reddit has a lot of people and types and all that, screaming ""check your provolones"" every 16 seconds to keep the social justice generator operational. As the Emperor sits the Throne, so do these people sit the toilet of broken concepts. Reddit is mostly a ""say what you want"" area, and that's awesome. Freedom is always good. /r/fatpeoplestories is a border between the two, sitting on the reddit side. The folks of this subreddit wish to say what they want, and the ""social justice warriors"" (the PC term for white knight, if you're paying attention) want to stop them. This subreddit is one of many where the groups clash, this is obviously very fun.

And that's what it comes down to. Drama. For many, it's more like ""drama, yes, more of it please"". For me it's ""I can't wait to see my inbox tomorrow."" So if you're sitting there with your tumblr dashboard in the background and an angry post titled ""Xavier Mendel: Literally Hitler"" being written, let it be known that the kernels can always use a little more heat.

I'm off topic. Let's talk more about /r/fatpeoplestories. To begin with: It's comedy. Who doesn't like a good laugh? The imagery is fantastic, and it doesn't pretend. Everything is straightforward, and it's exactly what you'd expect. But let's ask: Why did I choose to feature it? I mentioned social justice earlier, and some think that applies to fat people. That being fat is on the same level as a disability, and demand special seating, benefits, special treatment, but someone who eats too many Cheez-Its can stand. They're people like everyone else

Enough fucking around. Let's talk to the mods of /r/fatpeoplestories to see what they have to say.

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**EvilLittleCar** Fairly normal. I have two cats, a car, and a job. I'm trying to lose weight.

&gt;&gt;**TimMitchell** Just a 28 year old dude living on the east coast with my three Jack Russell terriers and lovely wife.

&gt;&gt;**KweeKoo** Ah not much to say without identity compromise, pugs, and lifting things. And I always hide my power level. Always.

&gt;#2. What's it like moderating FatPeopleStories?

&gt;&gt;**EvilLittleCar** A lot of fun. The readers are awesome and polite. I see a lot of great discussions happen in the comments. Even when the commenters disagree, my fellow mods are very fair and level headed. And they're pretty cool.

&gt;&gt;**TimMitchell** FPS is one of the more difficult places to moderate since you have to read the full story to make a decision. In other subs I can clear the whole mod queue in a couple minutes whereas in FPS it might take a few per post. Luckily, and eager to help the sub stay good.

&gt;&gt;**KweeKoo** It gives me the warm fuzzies most times, and it can get messy. Oh, and if I ever feel like straying from my healthy lifestyle I just have to think of this place and suddenly not feel like inhaling a block of Lindt after a shitty week, so that's a positive :)

&gt;#3. What has been your favorite story in your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**EvilLittleCar** That is a tough call. There are a lot of stories that have demonstrated the entitlement and selfishness of the typical ""hamplanet"" to such a degree that my jimmies have left the planet. (note: a hamplanet is an overweight person with ""fatlogic"" and entitlement

&gt;&gt;**TimMitchell** I've got so many it's hard to choose. I find myself giggling at /u/somethingiart 's [horse story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ar8op/she_wanted_to_ride_a_horse/) randomly. If I had to choose that would be it.

&gt;&gt;**KweeKoo** Tough call. Either [Doradus](http://i.imgur.com/T5nwBKu.jpg) because Foodbro is my blueprint for the perfect man

&gt;#4. Some people think this subreddit is offensive or ""wrong"". What might you say to those people?

&gt;&gt;**EvilLittleCar** I came to this subreddit and at first was angry thinking that they were making fun of fat people. But as I read, too, was making similar excuses. A lot of people on the sub, like myself, have come to realize that the reason we haven't lost weight is because of various excuses that fall under ""fatlogic"". e.g. I just walked 5 km, so I get to treat myself to a large dinner. And I would point out that really the name ""FatPeopleStories"" is a bit misleading, a more fitting name would be something like FatAsshatStories

&gt;&gt;**TimMitchell** Well

&gt;&gt;We are definitely not about hating fat people. I'd say the majority of removed posts are because the story is really just OP hating on a fat person or doesn't contain any ""fatlogic"". Fatlogic is hard to pin down

&gt;&gt;**KweeKoo** Are these people aware of where exactly they are

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch

&gt;&gt;**EvilLittleCar** Come check us out and read a few of the stories we have under ""List of Series"". You might find you can't have just one.

&gt;&gt;**TimMitchell** Welcome to anyone new and a sincere thank you to the community. This is one of the last

&gt;&gt;**KweeKoo** Thank you all for making this sub what it is today

Those are the mods of /r/fatpeoplestories. Pretty regular bunch, and didn't produce any shit whilst doing so. I can respect that.

Everybody gets one

I wanted to share this subreddit with you at a moment in time when I knew you'd love it as much as I do. This subreddit was my [*Ace of Spades*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KysKdijAhJI) for when something fell through. In this case

As a master of the [dark arts](http://imgur.com/a/2fOHi) myself, if you must know. What with my busy daily routine and what not I've been a lurker to this subreddit for over three months. And [boy](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/xxsgp/ladies_and_gentlemen_the_king_and_queen_of_sweden/) can I [tell](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/xzxu5/i_give_you_actually_i_forget_something_from_the/) you [everyday](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/ybz2x/cat_broke_and_im_concerned/) its been a [pleasure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/z9ymu/the_winners_of_the_dota_2_internationals/)

Fret not, and suggests to the community to alter it for the most hilarious / awesome results. I can not tell you how many times my mind has been blown away at the sheer level of detail, thought, and work that some of these alterations go through. 

/u/sexybabyjesus2 posted this [dog pic](http://i.imgur.com/h3vTB.jpg)... and all I could think about was how its the dog's version of [this pic.](http://i.imgur.com/alBOB.jpg) If I had the time and the hunger for karma I'd do one of those face swaps things thats so popular around these parts. After all

Interview on the way.


&gt; 1 How did you get in to photoshop? How long have you been practicing the dark arts?

&gt;&gt;**hero0fwar** [I] was given an old copy from a friend about 4 years ago. wasnt until just the last year or two that I really started playing around with it. I am still horrible though.

&gt;&gt;**MooGirl** I downloaded gimp after coming across this subreddit. I've been using for a couple months now.

**13

Some subreddits exist to post pictures of dogs (/r/beagles), /r/TumblrInAction would be ""lol"" in its literal sense. I can't browse that sub without laughing my ass off. Not in the literal sense, thankfully. TumblrInAction is dedicated to pointing out and discussing a group of people called Social Justice Warriors (SJWs). People who believe and rant out concepts that are hilarious to hear. Animals inhabiting human bodies, spirit fat, transethnicity, and some form of new psychosis called ""headmates"". Like the equally strange tulpae, headmating (sounds like a porno) is an act of having other creatures, even objects exist in your own mind. Like an imaginary friend, some have objects (invisible tea pot, /u/XavierMendel

The primary content of TiA is in posting tumblr images. For some reason these people congregate around Tumblr. I guess Wordpress is 2 kool 4 skool now. Common topics are _________ privilege, trans_______, and non-binary ________. I use blanks because I haven't a clue how many there are to describe. Thin privilege, fat privilege, white shaming, Oreo shaming, transdimensional, non-binary privilege shaming... It's all a blur.

The community is pretty straight forward. Get a picture, though I notice a few bad non-binary apples now and again. They're usually below the default cutoff line though, so no harm done. The CSS is basic and privileged, but the sidebar looks nice and unscummy. Not a whole lot to comment on otherwise.

Let's take a paragraph and talk about the people being noted. The social justice warriors will occasionally clash with their hooting audience, I do understand Newton's third law. Someone laughs at them, they threaten back, and the laughing grows in response (please don't let there be any physicists reading this, my STEM privilege doesn't prepare me for non-newtonian jokes). While Newton was almost certainly cis scum, punishable by public beheading under the first law of tumblr, he made a good point. I'll leave you to the conclusions drawn. Consider it a choose your own horror book. Like Goosebumps

So that's /r/TumblrInAction. ""But Xavier, young imaginary headmate transotherfat semi-person, the interview is here!

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**EvilFuckingSociopath** 'Sup

&gt;&gt;**ddxxdd** STEM guy about to graduate soon who spends too much time on Reddit.

&gt;&gt;**SlayBelle** I'm an undergraduate English and Ancient History Bachelor of Arts student

&gt;#2. Your sub is hilarious

&gt;&gt;**ArchangellePedophile** As you may or may not know, but other than that. and despite the controversial nature of the sub, she be smooth sailing. I spend most of my time modding SRSsucks, so I sorta see TiA as an outsider would. The growth and super cool community that has sprang up here has been pretty cool to watch develop from my perspective.

&gt;&gt;**EvilFuckingSociopath** Not too bad in terms of controversy. We're very lucky over here in that we have a wide variety of viewpoints represented in our userbase. We aren't a circlejerk for any one particular political view and when sensitive issues such as feminism are debated, are egalitarians who tend to make fun of all extremes when it comes to social justice movements, but we aren't here to slam the basics of established concepts. So, for example, we make fun of bloggers claiming we should start a new society by killing all men rather than insulting all of feminism.

&gt;&gt;AAP already mentioned that he spends most of his time on /r/SRSsucks. As an ex-mod of SRSS I can tell you that TiA is absolutely a lot easier to take care of. I try to maintain this by keeping metadrama out of our community

&gt;&gt;It is however a full time job,000 page views just this month. So while I don't often have to step in to calm down heated debates about controversial issues, there is a lot for us mods to oversee, and the fact we attract so much attention does of course also attract the odd troll now and then.

&gt;&gt;**ddxxdd** Check the spam filter

&gt;&gt;The only difficulty is determining where the line is between good ol' fashioned ""otherkin"" and irrelevant stuff like 4chan screenshots and overly serious submissions.

&gt;&gt;**SlayBelle** Our modmail is one of the funniest things on reddit I am pretty sure. It's awesome modding this little slice of crazy

&gt;&gt;Sometimes you bring the wrath of the SRS downvote brigade

&gt;#3. What exactly qualifies someone to be posted on TiA?

&gt;&gt;**EvilFuckingSociopath** In a word, but rather, we're against ridiculous attitudes. We often get points which would usually be perfectly valid made into insane nonsensical rants which are ripe for laughing at purely because of the blogger's attitude.

&gt;&gt;Of course

&gt;&gt;Which brings me onto the final point: the trademark of the social justice warrior is made up oppression. There is literally nothing in social justice land that doesn't count as either oppression or a source of ""unearned privilege."" Whether it counts as one or the other depends on whatever is the most convenient for the SJW's current argument. Consistency

&gt;&gt;**ddxxdd** If someone feels that their imaginary dragons and chubby waistline are the next frontier of civil rights

&gt;&gt;**SlayBelle** Someone who actually understands making up special disorders to be a unique snowflake is quite a silly thing and they deserve to have the full brunt of the interwebs point and laugh at them. For real

&gt;#4. Have you ever had those in the posts show up to defend themselves? How did it end up?

&gt;&gt;**EvilFuckingSociopath** We have had that a few times. It provides laughs for all. The best one

&gt;&gt;**ddxxdd** I've never seen it happen

&gt;&gt;**SlayBelle** 

&gt;#5. Thanks for your time

&gt;&gt;**EvilFuckingSociopath** Tumblr bloggers complain about non-existent oppression. We at TiA have [collectively donated over $500 to Doctors Without Borders.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/19c2u8/charity_update_we_did_it/) I ask you... who are the real social justice warriors here?

&gt;&gt;Always be yourself, always be Batman. I like to think we try our hardest to be Batman.

&gt;&gt;Thank you all

&gt;&gt;**ddxxdd** LOTS

&gt;&gt;**SlayBelle** Not that i've seen

&gt;&gt;Thanks for your time

&gt;&gt;I LIKE FLUFFY CAKE!

&gt;&gt;But really, know what an oxford comma is and how to use it and send me recipies.

&gt;&gt;XOXO Slay.

That was quite the interview. I consider myself lucky to have such a great *privilege* as being able to talk to all these wonderful mods. Honestly it's fun. Wacky modmail makes me happy. I really wish I could pack more jokes into this

We were all promised things in the 80s and early 90s, and I want it now!

""But Xavier

Wait

""Yeah

Hell yeah.

Bitcoin is all I wanted and more from a digital currency. It's simple, willing to answer even my stupidest of questions. /r/Bitcoin specifically has given me quite a lot to think about these past couple months, and a lot of good reading material. Love's such an old fashioned word, but I'm willing to care for this economy at the edge of the night. I firmly believe that bitcoin is the future, and the people at /r/bitcoin are pulling it ever closer. From all the fantastic guides on mining to the incredible charity, its users have had an awesome effect on the world.

Before we get to the wonderful interview portion, and it'd be cool to reward people with something a little more useful than reddit gold. I suggest you check out that subreddit for the relevant info.

Today we have some special guests from the bitcoin community

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**Theymos** I am a 21-year-old computer science student from Wisconsin. I am the most senior moderator of /r/Bitcoin and the head administrator of bitcointalk.org. I created the first Bitcoin Block Explorer

&gt;&gt;**Jon Matonis** I am an e-Money researcher and crypto economist covering the Bitcoin economy for Forbes Magazine and American Banker.

&gt;&gt;**Evoorhees** My name is Erik, marketing, and brand development guy. Most people in the Bitcoin community probably first hear about me from the paper I wrote last year: Bitcoin - The Libertarian Introduction. I'm an American but have recently left the country because it is far too socialist for my liking.

&gt;#2. How did you first discover bitcoin?

&gt;&gt;**Theymos** I first heard about Bitcoin in February of 2010 via a post on 4chan. I've always had a great interest in distributed systems

&gt;&gt;**Jon Matonis** I first discovered Bitcoin through my research into digital cash and virtual currencies. Satoshi had contacted me directly because of my economics blog and asked me to take a studied look at the cryptocurrency.

&gt;&gt;**Evoorhees** In May 2011 I saw a Facebook post from a friend,000% in the last six months"". I clicked the link and upon reading about it, immediately though, ""wow this is the stupidest thing ever... made up internet money... obviously a scam or bubble or some other nonsense."" However, my curiosity pulled me further, and after about an hour of reading various articles about Bitcoin, I had a very clear epiphany that this was the most important thing I had ever come across, eating Cheerios

&gt;#3. In your own words

&gt;&gt;**Theymos** Bitcoin is a currency like dollars, not politicians, developers, or even the majority of users. Bitcoin is also a payment processing system which allows you to cheaply and quickly send bitcoins to other people. Using Bitcoin, I could securely send $100,000 in bitcoins from the US to China in ~10 minutes while paying less than $0.10 in transaction fees, and this transaction would be more non-reversible than even a wire transfer.

&gt;&gt;**Jon Matonis** To the uninitiated

&gt;&gt;**Evoorhees** Bitcoin is one of mankind's greatest inventions. It is a form of money superior to all others. It is a grand experiment, but wrested from the State through the beneficence of technology. If Bitcoin is successful, it will change not only how money works, but society itself - freeing people, empowering them, and providing a means of individual protection. Bitcoin is the antidote to a century of misguided central planning in the realm of money.

&gt;#4. Where do you see the future of bitcoin in 5 years? 10? 20?

&gt;&gt;**Theymos** Satoshi Nakamoto, ""I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume."" Bitcoin is an extremely powerful technology with the potential to change the world. I think that Bitcoin is likely to grow substantially in 5-10 years, though there are a number of potential challenges that could slow Bitcoin's growth. For example, governments could severely regulate companies that let you buy bitcoins. In 20 years, Bitcoin could be bigger than many government-issued currencies, but I also wouldn't be all that surprised if Bitcoin is replaced by something that is better than Bitcoin in all ways (maybe using quantum cryptography). Bitcoin is the first system of its kind, so anything could happen.

&gt;&gt;**Jon Matonis** In 5 years

&gt;&gt;In 10 years

&gt;&gt;In 20 years

&gt;&gt;**Evoorhees** Well in 20 years, in which case all the benefits of Bitcoin are still realized.

&gt;&gt;In five years, Bitcoin will be almost as old as the euro is today, and I'd bet considerable money that its record of performance will be superior.

&gt;#5. Thanks everybody. Anything else you'd like to say to the world?

&gt;&gt;**Theymos** Read the sidebar of /r/Bitcoin for instructions on how to get started and more info about Bitcoin. I will answer questions about Bitcoin in this comment section.

&gt;&gt;**Jon Matonis** I would like to add that many people are familiar with BitTorrents and how they have caused disruptive problems in the copyright world today with very little method of recourse from the authorities. Well

&gt;&gt;**Evoorhees** If you care about the future of humanity, and even if you don't care to get involved in using or developing it further, you owe it to yourself to learn about it.

&gt;&gt;Bitcoin is absolutely fascinating and the most exciting thing I've ever come across

Bitcoin is one of those things that don't come along every lifetime. I hope it outlives me. While that wouldn't be an accomplishment of any sort

*Science!* No one has ever gotten upset about science ever in the world ever. That's a fact. Or is it. Yes, Thermite and Liquid Nitrogen, Mentos and Diet Cola. I welcome you to /r/chemicalreactiongifs. Where gifs go [ffffTTffffftfff](http://i.imgur.com/PHOACru.gif), [SssploofffFFFF](http://www.gifti.me/i/PeDJlv1g.gif) and most importantly [Blioob, pphhfffTHwoOOBOOO](http://i.minus.com/ie9xHjSltd94O.gif). I've got these sounds down to an art form. I can't really watch these chemicals react without making some noise movement with my face lips. You may call it a problem but I call it a gift. Try it yourself, especially if you need to clean your screen.

Personally I think [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/K580K3r.jpg) is awesome. It reminds me of some kind of special effect from Hellraiser! I'm expecting a human-like spider man from hell to peep out from it but alas my dreams are unfulfilled as it turns into ice cream. Or there are gifs that are a tad less professional, what did you expect clicking that? And why did he think that was a good idea? Did he do it for fame? Did he do it for the glory? No. No you fool! He did it for **Science!** [Wahploo-sploooSSSSsss](http://i.imgur.com/c5FYq9K.gif)!

[Yeah! Science Bitch!](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/yeah-science-bitch-meme.jpg) Look at those chemicals react! It's a shame I have next to no knowledge about the actual science happening in these gifs but I can still merrily sit and watch, well, my mind is a bit blown think of more quippy quotes to write, plus I'm alliterating a lot. So I asked the mods some questions instead:

&gt;##1. How did /r/chemicalreactiongifs begin?

&gt;&gt; **lolitsaj** It began when I saw a gif of a chemical reaction on /r/chemistry. There was a big complaint thread at the time about how /r/chemistry was getting too silly and how there wasn't enough hardcore chemistry on the subreddit. So I created /r/chemicalreactiongifs so there would be a place dedicated to just reactions!

&gt;&gt; **thetoethumb** /u/lolitsaj has it spot on in his response. I think I joined when the subreddit had about a thousand users.  
&gt;##2. Do you have a favourite chemical reaction gif or gifs?

&gt;&gt; **lolitsaj** My favorite reaction is the barking dog

&gt;&gt; **ADHD_orc** Mine are any of the gifs that have to do with Elephant Toothpaste. [These](http://i.imgur.com/tCx2S5B.gif) two [images](http://i.imgur.com/3qERmOu.gif) manage to make me laugh whenever I see them.

&gt;&gt; **thetoethumb** Probably the [reaction of rubidium in water with phenolphthalein indicator](http://i.imgur.com/AqLXp8p.gif). Everyone goes ""Let's see francium!"" but that's never going to happen. Accept that now.

&gt;##3. Have you had any real life experiences with chemical mishaps?

&gt;&gt; **lolitsaj** I'm a chemistry student so I have plenty of chemical mishaps on a regular basis. Luckily I haven't managed to severely burn myself yet. The worst being when I touched my eye after handling dilute sulfuric acid. It burned and felt odd for weeks.

&gt;&gt; **ADHD_orc** I've spilled really diluted sulfuric acid on my hands before when I had highschool chem lab

&gt;&gt; **thetoethumb** Nothing too serious (yet) which is nice. I'm a chemical engineering student rather than just chemistry so I don't get to play with the chemicals directly as much

&gt;##4. Are there any particular reasons that chemical reaction gifs are the best gifs?

&gt;&gt; **lolitsaj** Chemical reactions are the best gifs because they do things you'd never expect like rapid color changing

&gt;&gt; **ADHD_orc** The top of /r/chemicalreactiongifs is much more interesting than the top of /r/reactiongifs

&gt;&gt; **thetoethumb** I think the reason they're the best is because they are so unexpected to most people. The shock factor makes it entertaining and we all tend to like that. 

&gt;##5. Finally

&gt;&gt; **lolitsaj** I would thank the subscribers for being a part of the subreddit. Also for the amount of posts recently - it's been a pretty good influx in activity. It just keeps growing and we really love to see chemistry be so popular.

&gt;&gt; **ADHD_orc** You guys are awesome

&gt;&gt; **thetoethumb** Stop complaining about reposts and continue being awesome.

Thanks for reading readers of Reddit and thanks to /r/chemicalreactiongifs for responding to my questions. It's a very fun Subreddit for science lovers and people that like making stupid noises whilst staring at a computer. [Ttchh-fffffffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFbwaRghLlllMMM](http://i.imgur.com/CgCt3qS.gif)

Hello World! It's been awhile. I've been AFK for a good amount of weeks
         

I normally try and avoid subreddits based on content that is supposed to elicit an emotion or a feeling, however. ASMR is closing in on 40,000 users, and has been around for over two years, it's clear it is here to stay. **HOWEVER** I do stress that you study the sidebar of this subreddit, learn what is allowed and not allowed, a strong understanding of the subreddit will help you, enjoy the subreddit to its fullest extent.            
         
Enough blabbering. I'm tired

&gt;##1. Alright
     
&gt;&gt;**mahi-mahi**: ASMR is the name we give to a pleasurable sensation (often in the form of tingling or numbness in the scalp) some people experience in regards to different situations. People have different ""triggers"" for this sensation, a medical exam) or watching people performing simple tasks. Often the triggers are mostly sound-based - clicking, brushing, lip smacking, whispers. Particular speech patterns (lisp, accent) can also intensify the reaction. For most people, it is simply a soothing, there are now numerous ""ASMRtists"" who produce videos with the sole intention of inducing those tingles.    
     
&gt;&gt;**MrStonedOne**: You know when you hear certain sounds, pens dropping, clock ticking, white noise nails tapping, etc; having something explained to you; Getting Haircuts or Head Massages; (To list a few). -- Some people get asmr stronger then others, I only experience a relaxing feeling, others experience tingling sensations comparable to the feeling you get when you first smoke cigarettes
    

&gt;##2. What inspired you to create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**MrStonedOne**:I stumbled upon [This link](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/fni64/til_about_asmr_aka_that_unnamed_feeling_or_head/). I remember getting asmr as a kid, it would be really cool to see some videos and get some triggers. I wonder what the subreddit is named?"". After searching through the comments, all I found were 3 comments an hour old all saying ""someone should create a subreddit for this"". - I, already having a history running web forums, decided to take the initiative and do so. (Funny story, i actually misspelled it and created [/r/a***ms***r](/r/amsr) at first. Got as far as doing the side bar and everything before i noticed as i was typing the comment announcing the subreddit.)  

   
&gt;##3. What should people expect to find on r/ASMR?


&gt;&gt;**mahi-mahi**: Mostly videos which feature one or many possible ASMR triggers (some intentionally made to trigger ASMR, binaural sounds videos, etc. Also the occasional discussion about ASMR.

   
&gt;&gt;**MrStonedOne**: Mainly videos of the common triggers



&gt;##4. What link would you say best exhibits the ASMR feeling?
 

&gt;&gt;**mahi-mahi**: Bob Ross (yes
    
&gt;&gt;**MrStonedOne**: http://www.filmofilia.com/watch-full-oscar-nominated-short-fresh-guacamole-by-pes-137992/ - Fresh Guacamole. Would have to be my pick.



&gt;##5. Favorite part about being a moderator for this subreddit?

[Speed. formula 1 is speed.](http://cdn.bikyamasr.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/formula_1.jpg)

I am not a mechanical engineer or something but they say that the amount of high technology that is put into the formula 1 cars is equal to the grade of technology into rockets! amazing isnt it ? For those who dont know

The cars running at 350kmph speed across the tracks and appear as a blur if you are at the track (of course they are slow at turns &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;). Started in 1906 this is one of the world's most famous and adrealine filled sport there is! 

There are a total of 20 grand races this year in some amazing kick ass circuits! Personally i love the [Singapore GP](http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/f1_09_29/f101_16539203.jpg) which was the first night race and races inside the city! Having actually stood on the track (when no one was racing duh &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; . .) i must say i loved every inch of it! :D

These legendary races on the legendary tracks have produced some wait for it- LEGENDARY Drivers! The most famous Driver today must be [Michael Schumacher](http://celebcenter.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/michaelschumacher1.jpg). The driver who won the championship 7 times is arguably the greatest driver of all times. He recently came back from his retirement but i personally think he is just doing that for fun :D But my favourite is definitely [Kimi Raikkonen](http://www.formula1.com/photos/teams_and_drivers/driver_profile/main/main_profile_12.jpg) from the Lotus team. He is AWESOME! 

In a nutshell

Finally /r/formula1 is the Formula One hub of Reddit and i take great pride in featuring it! Here's my interview with the moderators there! 

&gt;##1. What inspires/motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**HeikkiKovalainen:** My love of the sport. Some of the best engineers in the world, it's the [insane speed](http://youtubedoubler.com/?video1=JUhu13qp8Oc&amp;start1=0&amp;video2=seget3zOj_8&amp;start2=0&amp;authorName=Not+Sure) and close calls they have. By the way, one of those cars on the left topped the Top Gear power lap board - so they're not slow!  
**Vilkku:** Back in 2009, one of the motivations was to make it more known, more active, and just overall a great place to go for Formula 1 discussion. I also didn't have any other place where I discussed Formula 1, so I really wanted it to be possible to use the subreddit as the only place you needed for F1 content.

&gt;##2. Whose your favourite driver (presently or past) and the favourite team ?
&gt;&gt;**HeikkiKovalainen:** I change every year. This year
**Vilkku:** I'm a Finn, I was quite young then, and when I really begun to understand F1 Häkkinen was quitting and Kimi Räikkönen had just joined the circus, so I feel like I have a stronger ""connection"", if that makes any sense, to Räikkönen than to Häkkinen - especially now that he is back in F1 again after a two year break in rallying. And it of course doesn't hurt that they've done quite well! While I have great respect and admiration for the greats such as Senna and Prost, I can't really say they are my favourite drivers because I never got to watch them race.  
As for my favourite team

&gt;##3. Which is your favourite race ever ?
&gt;&gt;**HeikkiKovalainen:** Brazil 08 - The final race of the 2008 season. Lewis Hamilton ([white overalls yellow helmet](http://i.l.cnn.net/cnn/2007/SPORT/10/07/china.formulaone/art.hamiltonchina.gi.jpg)) is leading the championship. The only person that can stop him is Felipe Massa ([red overalls green helmet](http://www3.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Brazilian+F1+Grand+Prix+5rmDRrEWxu8l.jpg)). If Massa wins the race
**Vilkku:** Tough one. The Japanese Grand Prix of 1998 and 1999 are strong candidates, and had [one of the coolest overtakes in the history of F1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eE3gCy5zvM&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=67s), so that could also be a candidate. As could the 2005 Japanese GP, which Räikkönen won by overtaking on the final lap, or the 2007 Brazilan GP, where Räikkönen won his so far only championship after being only third in the standings before the race. So, as you can see, but also about the story lines and the big picture. One that did have some great racing, there have been many great classical races

&gt;##4. if you had a chance to race in a track which one would it be ?
&gt;&gt;**HeikkiKovalainen:** Belgium - the track where that youtubedoubler clip from above is from. But for me to properly explain why
**Vilkku:** Probably Spa in Belgium, and that's one of the few where I don't do horribly bad in various racing games.

&gt;##5. F1's race has changed over the years in rules and stuff ? do you think it changed for the good or bad ?
&gt;&gt;**HeikkiKovalainen:** Very
**Vilkku:** I've written quite long answers on the previous questions, pit stops, and other rules. Overall, it just feels a lot more restricted than it did 10-15 years ago and before that, while some additions to the cars like KERS and DRS (a system which allows the driver to open a flap on the rear wing, which is beneficial on certain parts on the track) feel a bit too artificial. On the other hand, this season has been one of the most interesting ones yet, which has really made it a lot more unpredictable and more enjoyable to follow


&gt;##6. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**HeikkiKovalainen:** Keep being awesome. There's no other F1 forum around that has such camaraderie and a lack of fanboyism
**Vilkku:** To the current ones: Thanks for sticking around and making the subreddit as big and lively as it is today! Thanks for all the great submissions and the great discussion.  
To future subscribers: I tried to write some crappy marketing message here, check out the subreddit! We are approaching the final races of the season and the championship is very much undecided, so now is a great time to start watching.


Happy friday and happy racing! :D

Skyrim is getting insane reviews from nearly every reputable game critic and player.   But the best review award goes to redditor rmg22893 who writes

Immediately upon visiting /r/Skyrim, it has everything you could ask for in a great community.  There's a ton of interesting, helpful and fun posts, the comments below each post are numerous, well thought out and very entertaining.   The pièce de résistance, however, is the wonderful participation by the multitudinous and super-handsome community at large.

&gt;&gt;It's been awesome through and through. First I got lucky and created the sub

&gt;Leading up to the release date

&gt;&gt;""Can I run this?"". For the longest time the answer would be ""no one knows"", but with mods everything is possible.) Riding dragons was never really a hope but it was mentioned as a cool idea a few times.

&gt;What helpful or entertaining stuff will we find at /r/Skyrim?

&gt;&gt;News and discussions about Skyrim! No really. But more specifically

&gt;Tell us about the community members. What do they bring to the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;The community members bring... everything really. Specifically

&gt;What names come up most often?

Here at Subreddit of the Day, we know to bring what should be brought. The words we type, and the words you read, are bound by this code. Today, on the 15th of February, we're bringing back the awesome for round two. Although a fair few of you don't care for the subreddit being featured today, rest assured that the awesome is being brought.

As you may know from my feature of /r/MLPTunes, you'll be hard pressed to find a discussion I haven't weighed in heavily on. Being retired, I probably spend more time there than a dozen of its general members put together. I know from firsthand knowledge that this is a great subreddit. And though I've reviewed many subreddits here, each better than the last, this one stands out to me as the subreddit I can identify most with. These aren't just fans of Friendship is Magic, and they're not just a collection of redditors. We call each other bronies for a reason, after all.

/r/MyLittlePony is fantastic. It's brilliant and magnificent and outstanding. It goes above and beyond what a subreddit is. For that, with quality varying wildly between communities as anywhere else. /r/MyLittlePony isn't just another subreddit, though. It's not just another subreddit, existing for some sole purpose and sticking to it. /r/MyLittlePony is a community in the full glory that the title implies. It's not a subreddit for Friendship is Magic, as I said before. It's a community for the people that love it. Though that has weight, and I'm not sure some agree, I know it to be true.

The people of this community are some of the nicest folks I've ever had the chance to talk with. Its culture is that of caring for your fellow person. It's something that I believe in. Although many mock the term

A big part of /r/MyLittlePony is in artwork. There are so many incredible artists in this fandom, music, modelling, or otherwise, is the greatest thing in the community. I can never browse without wonder, and I can never look without a smile. It's an experience that I truly believe has set this community apart from all others. They don't just watch the show and talk about its storyline. They create entire worlds from its stories.

I could write for days about everything in this community, who decided to give a unified response through RainbowCrash. I'll let him take the stage.

&gt;#1. Hi

&gt;&gt;**RainbowCrash** All of us are in our 20’s. Several of us are still in college, the creator of the subreddit, Lebal, decided to put up moderator applications, and all of us applied, and having seen each other around, all nominated each other. From there we shaped the direction of the subreddit through its rapid growth, we’ve had trouble keeping up with the massive influx of passionate users and activity we’ve seen. We continue to try our hardest to hold new events that excite the community and bring us together, share links

&gt;&gt;**Optimistic_Outcome** The mods of /r/mylittlepony are a vibrant bunch. We're pretty much all geeky guys, and I myself am very passionate about astronomy. The mod team is a nice cast of characters who happen to share a love for My Little Pony. Since becoming moderators, we've developed great relationships with each other. We have a Skype chat that gives us easy access to each other 24/7, and it's proven to not only be a fantastic tool for moderating the subreddit appropriately, but it has also been a great source for us to get together and just chat it up, play games, or whatever. Hell, we are crazy.

&gt;#2. The MyLittlePony subreddit is incredibly popular. What's it like moderating it?

&gt;&gt;**RainbowCrash** What’s interesting about /r/mylittlepony is the sheer level of passion and activity it creates. Although 180th in subscriber count

&gt;&gt;**Optimistic_Outcome** Nothing short of a joy. The moderating philosophies of /r/mylittlepony have helped to create a subreddit filled with folks who actively help to enforce our rules and standards. We try to incorporate user feedback as much as possible anytime we change our policies or make major decisions about the subreddit through polls and mod posts. While we never enjoy having to use mod powers to remove posts or comments, they are often very understanding. Long story short: the people that use /r/mylittlepony make it a great place to be a moderator of. The reddit FAQ says that moderating is a thankless job, but we have found that to be very untrue.

&gt;#3. What episode would you suggest nonbronies watch first if they want to try it?

&gt;&gt;**RainbowCrash** That depends entirely on who the person is, and is all-around fun. It is quite a bit cheesier and more-girly than most episodes, and doesn’t follow the traditional slice-of-life format of the rest of the series, but it’s nonetheless a great place to start. If you’re only willing to watch a single episode, I suggest “Lesson Zero”, “Bridle Gossip”, or “Applebuck Season”. If starting from the beginning, you’ll need to use proxyfree if you’re in the US. They are also available for stream on Netflix

&gt;&gt;**Optimistic_Outcome** Mare Do-Well! Best episode ever! (No

&gt;&gt;I would say that a good episode to start with is Season 1 Episode 25 “Party of One.” I think its absolute craziness lends itself as a great hook for people who might be pretty skeptical of the show. Another great one to start with is Season 2's opening 2-part episode “The Return of Harmony”. It gives a nice summary of what each of the main characters represent to get someone up to speed and has one of the best villains in any cartoon show I can think of - Discord. (voiced by John de Lancie, then you should be watching them in the order of release, but that's not super important as the episodes are more or less meant to stand on their own.

&gt;#4. You've had a lot of events in the past. Contests and challenges

&gt;&gt;**RainbowCrash** In the past we’ve run several events, and are constantly seeking new ways to involve the community and offer prizes people care about. The community is always very generous in offering up giveaway prizes, however finding a good communal prize is tough. For Benders vs Bronies, the winning team got the reddit-wide logo for a day, courtesy of the admins. We always want to one-up ourselves, and we’re finding that’s getting harder and harder. To answer your question more specifically, yes

&gt;&gt;**Optimistic_Outcome** Contests and giveaways have been a huge part of /r/mylittlepony since the early days. The [Benders vs. Bronies](http://redd.it/100178) contest went better than any of us could have ever imagined ($33

&gt;#5. Thanks

&gt;&gt;**RainbowCrash** I want to say thank you for the kindness and fun you guys have shown me over the past 20 or so months. It’s certainly been a journey. What makes this community so great is our members. Keep up the good work.

&gt;&gt;**Optimistic_Outcome** Thanks to all our users who continue to make /r/mylittlepony an awesome place to be! I look forward to what the future can bring for us all. Thanks to SRotD for featuring us a second time! Finally

I love the people that made this all happen

This has been your knight of dawn and dusk

(Author's note: for the record

Ah

""Golly

If only it were so easy, the sheer number and types can be a bit overwhelming to an amateur with no idea where to begin.

That's where /r/learnprogramming comes in!

/r/learnprogramming is a large and bustling sub where programmers of all skill levels can come and ask for help

As a 2nd year CS student and a subscriber, and every time I've received nothing but informative answers back. 

But that's not all! /r/learnprogramming also hosts posts about any [free programming classes](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/15tzua/heres_a_list_of_32_free_online_programmingcs/) that MIT and other prestigious institutions like to offer

While real-life programmers' [keyboards may not glamorously glow](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02365/coding_alamy_2365972b.jpg) with the power of mysterious computer magic and programming itself is nothing like [pointing at random numbers in space](http://decipher-research.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Computer-Programming2.jpg)

Here today to talk to us about this wonderful sub are two of its moderators

&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/learnprogramming?
&gt;&gt;**trpcicm and zzyzzyx** Neither zzyzzyzz nor trpcicm were founders of the subreddit (that title goes to 6553321 and CarlH)

&gt;2.How/when did you personally learn how to program
&gt;&gt;**trpcicm and zzyzzyx** zzyzzyxx has been programming since he was 13, learning C++ so he could become a coder on a MUD, a text based game he was infatuated with at the time.

&gt;&gt;Between the two active moderators, Java, Ruby, Python, and Javascript at an ""advanced"" level. They're also dangerous with C#, Lisp, MATLAB, Groovy

&gt;3.If you were just starting to learn how to program today
&gt;&gt;**trpcicm and zzyzzyx**Well the first thing we would do is to subscribe to the LearnProgramming subreddit

&gt;4.Are any of you guys professional programmers?
&gt;&gt;**trpcicm and zzyzzyx** We both are! zzyzzyxx worked at Amazon for two years

&gt;5.Quick: what is your favorite language and why? 
&gt;&gt;**trpcicm and zzyzzyx** zzyzzyxx is still a fan of his first, and don't require as much ""attention to detail"" to make sure things don't explode.

&gt;##2. What makes a good montage parody?

&gt;&gt;   /u/renuf Good montage parodies don't necessarily have to use dubstep, because it has to maintain a certain level of veracity or believability in the eyes of the viewer. Often times it doesn't matter the editor you use, as long as you get the spirit of what montage parodies do, which is poke fun at people who take their video games a bit too seriously. Being able to highlight what the standard video game montage maker would find ""xXSO_EPICXx"" and using effects that mimic their techniques (over-bloom, saturation, Call of Duty sound effects, even the reaction screams of the kids in chat) seems to be the best way to make a montage feel ""MLG"". Of course, as well as selectively placing text (""360 no scope bitch"" is one good

Today we celebrate a subreddit devoted to a game which brings a strong rush known as *nostalgia*. This game is a piece of history (just like everything

Super Smash Bros is a fighting game published by Nintendo. But what is so special about this fighting game? Well, you need to throw your opponents off a stage. You need to get rid of them for good. It is just a game everyone need to play once before they die. Just like the fact that you [need to watch Office Space](http://i.imgur.com/b9WhA.gif) before you ""change your mortal life for that of immortality"" .

My first experience with Smah Bros Melee was on a Nintendo Gamecube, I sucked, but everyhting changed one particular day. You see, the Nintendo Gamecube consoles contain [a little yellow joystick](http://i.imgur.com/LO5rI7q.jpg). Besides using it as the ""looking around"" joystick in first person shooters, you never use it. But one day, during one of my [hopeless attempts](http://i.imgur.com/N53iz.gif) for victory, I used the yellow joystick just to see what happened. And [I hit hard](http://i.imgur.com/DDhtWim.gif). 

For some reason the developers decided to give a purpose to this underestimated joystick

I [still sucked at the game](http://i.imgur.com/O1KwU.gif) though. But for some reason I loved it. 

/r/SmashBros is the place for all the nostalgic gamers, here is a word from our sponsors:

I talked with the mods about the games and the subreddit.



&gt;#1. When did you start playing the game?

&gt;&gt;    **Elbedhar**    I started playing Smash back in 1999 when the original game came out. My first experience with competitive Smash was with Melee in 2006. 

&gt;&gt;    **SilentViolins**    Melee: 2001

&gt;#2. What makes this game so addictive?

&gt;&gt;    **Elbedhar**    There are so many different ways to play! Smash is a blast with a group of 4 friends

&gt;&gt;    **SilentViolins**    The range of control you have over your character allows for individualistic expression through regular gameplay. That's why a lot of top level players look very distinctive

&gt;#3. Which character do you play the most

&gt;&gt;    **Elbedhar**    I main Mario in Smash 64, but with Ice Climbers I remember thinking it was really cool that I could get a free Smash attack from a grab. Discovering that is how I got started with them.

&gt;&gt;    **SilentViolins**    Samus, decent projectiles, amazing recovery, longest grab in the game, good pokes, great edgeguard game, decent aerials

&gt;#4. And which character do you hate to play against? (besides kriby of course)

&gt;&gt;    **Elbedhar**    In Smash 64, who have a bad matchup against her. In Brawl, Meta Knight is the most annoying opponent for me.

&gt;&gt;    **SilentViolins**    Probably Jigglypuff

&gt;#5. What kind of things can you find on this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;    **Elbedhar**    We're the go-to place on reddit for all new information about Smash 4. You can also find tournament news and highlights, community resources, general discussion, and gameplay help. /r/smashbros is absolutely bustling with new content every day.

&gt;&gt;    **SilentViolins**    Combo videos, tournament details, stream links... you name it.

&gt;#6. Anything else you'd like to add? 

&gt;&gt;    **Elbedhar**    Whether you prefer playing in tournaments or enjoy casually beating up on your friends, but I also hope that everyone takes a look at the tournament-related content that people are submitting. Competitive Smash is a wildly exciting fighting game that continues to attract players from all corners of the world. Just a couple weekends ago we had our largest tournament in Smash history at [Evolution 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cj9kl5BqWU), and the scene is only continuing to grow.

&gt;&gt;    **SilentViolins**    Probably start with ""Which game do you play?""

Daft Punk

You know, I was more into the grunge/rock music like Nirvana, Guns and Roses etc. I was watching Channel V (it’s an Australian music channel) one night and Daft Punk’s “Around the World/Harder Better Faster Stronger” from Alive 2007 came on and I was instantly hooked. The next day I immediately went to the shops to find something from Daft Punk, and I found Discovery. Only the BEST DP album EVAR. Finding Daft Punk made me quit that rock music shit and made me transition into house music.

My love for electronic music has increased more and more over the years

Over the course of these six years I’ve become a big fan of almost all electronic music, happy? No? Ok, here’s an interview with the moderators of /r/DaftPunk.

&gt;##1. How did you find out about Daft Punk?
&gt;&gt; **/u/Rexcinerum** The first time I heard Daft Punk was right after *Discovery* dropped. I remember the disco vibe mixed with the electronic style was unlike anything I'd ever heard at the time. ""One More Time

&gt;&gt; **/u/douglasr007** It all started while watching music videos on MTV and VH1 back in Spring 2001. (Yes

&gt;&gt; **/u/ogcm** I remember when I was around 11 or 12


&gt;##2. What's your favourite DP song/album?
&gt;&gt; **Rexcinerum** My favorite Daft Punk song is ""Face to Face."" Daft Punk's passion shines through in the dynamic interplay between the unmistakable disco beat and the strong complimenting vocals that add depth to the track. *Discovery* is my favorite album for pretty much the same reasons.

&gt;&gt; **douglasr007** In my opinion, and ""Steam Machine"" for *Human After All*. My favorite album is *Discovery* because that's the album that made me love the duo in the first place. It's also the album that made me love electronic music in general.

&gt;&gt; **ogcm** Hands down Pheonix/Homework. I can't understand how Pheonix has such a profound effect, with the samples from SNL, I'm really excited for RAM, it sounds reminds me of Homework. Daft Punk gets funky right.

&gt;##3. How big is your love for Daft Punk? 
&gt;&gt; **Rexcinerum** It's big. Each album has a distinctly different feel, allusions, and meanings in their music with each listen.

&gt;&gt;**douglasr007** My love for the duo has always been huge. I've listened to anything that's come from Bangalter and Guy Man. I've been pretty passive with their fandom in the past few years but I will always respect their general outlook when it comes to music.

&gt;&gt; **ogcm** It's unmeasurable

&gt;##4. What's the best part about being a moderator on /r/DaftPunk?
&gt;&gt; **Rexcinerum** The community is filled with so much passion for the group. It feels awesome to be a part of the team that makes sure everybody gets the most out of their /r/daftpunk experience.

&gt;&gt; **douglasr007** There's no us versus them mentality. If there's any problems about the subreddit

&gt;&gt; **ogcm** The fact that I am somewhat of importance and use for a community that revolves around Daft Punk.

&gt;##5. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **Rexcinerum** Keep making OC, and it's only fitting that a great group like Daft Punk have such a great community behind them. (And I'd like to give a special thanks to everybody that helped me iron out the issues with the style.) -Rexcinerum

&gt;&gt; **douglasr007** Thank you. Thank you for submitting original content to the subreddit. The subreddit wouldn't be possible without you. It's obvious the subreddit didn't explode in popularity until news about *Random Access Memories* started coming out in the past few weeks. I can't wait for the album release and it's going to be special to see how 6000+ subscribers will think about the album when it comes out in May.

&gt;&gt; **ogcm** I love you. Seriously. Always great content

Phew! That was a big interview. On a sidenote, and holy fuck. I'm up to Instant Crush right now, and this is just bliss to my ears. I love you Daft Punk, I'm a fan for life. And to everyone at Wee Waa for the album launch, I'm jealous of you. Have a great time there! Kanga, out.",,self,WRITER,

Today is May 4th popularly known as [National Star Wars Day!](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbpi6ZahtOH6Ug4TFr0K37VID2tI47taf) Today we celebrate the wookies, ruthless villains with immense power, Heroes who rely on faith, old wise men with tales of the past, droids with one liners and everything in between. Today we Celebrate **EVERYTHING** StarWars. Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay its become a time honored tradition. It started when SROTD first [started itself.](http://redd.it/h3ppm) And last year's feature was even [better.](http://redd.it/t6ldf) I don't think I can top it. I mean for god's sakes man, there was a poem, a prologue and even a disclaimer! [Ah....](http://i.imgur.com/JQSzoAN.gif) We'd also want to take this moment and honor the fine Jedi MODS Masters and their wonderful achievements. But to do so

A long time ago in a subreddit far far away. /u/Noche created /r/StarWars and it was good. Then came a mysterious fellow by the name of /r/jaxspider who promised to bring peace to the ~~galaxy~~ subreddit. And so he did. He vanquished the blogspam siths and did away with the boring default CSS stylesheet. He formed a council of wise Jedi masters to help him

Normally we ask the mods questions to make you, HoverZoom over the pictures, comment in the discussion threads, and enjoy yourself. If you love any part of Star Wars, be it light saber battles, Expanded Universe questions or even  something nostalgic this is the right place for you.

&gt; To spice up this feature I'll  ask you the readers some questions instead!

&gt;&gt;1. What was your first Star Wars memory?
2. Whats your favorite scene and why?
3. How excited are you about the new movies?
4. Would you let the wookie win?
5. In your own words why is The Empire Strikes Back the perfect sequel? 
6. How would you torture Jar Jar Binks to the death?
7. Han Solo
8. Star Wars is not without it's cringe worthy moments. What real life moment related to Star wars do you still cringe to this day?
9. What one thing would you like to be officially retconned out of existence?

Britain: a land of [beastly weather](http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/large_lightbox/hash/a7/f5/a7f558b2e0445d78b01583c7cd270013.jpg)

However, moments of awkwardness, and battles with self-checkout machines), the vast majority are complaints from a uniquely British perspective. 

To help yourself get into the spirit of the subreddit, you'll be officially ready to read the following posts aloud with me and with a little inflated outrage to capture the mood:

* [People obsess over Oreos

* [Its international 'Talk like a Pirate day' but I come from Bristol so I talk like a pirate every day](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/104uvr/its_international_talk_like_a_pirate_day_but_i)

* [The mods won't let me complain about the French.](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/wxf26/the_mods_wont_let_me_complain_about_the_french/)

* [The multiple tills at McDonald's creates an unacceptable queuing situation](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/vuawu/the_multiple_tills_at_mcdonalds_creates_an/)

Without even ever having stepped foot on the soft, if anyone is willing to pay my way to visit the mother land, I'm willing to bet my return fare that I could blend right in given all that I've learned while making this post!

But enough about me. Let's talk about BritishProblems

&gt;1. What inspired you to create r/britishproblems?

&gt;&gt;**Ooer** I will leave that for Skuld to answer

&gt;&gt;**Skuld** I dropped my biscuit in my tea.

&gt;2.As a filthy Yank

&gt;&gt;**Ooer** Such a website exists! www.translatebritish.com does a pretty good job at covering most of the colourful words in circulation here. (Please note that autocorrect is asking me to change that word to colorful).

&gt;&gt;**Skuld** This site seems good for definitions of common terms: http://septicscompanion.com/. If you don't understand a reference

&gt;3.What made you all decide to forbid complaints about other countries?

&gt;&gt;**Ooer** Problems were becoming less about Britain and more about everywhere else. Despite what you may hear

&gt;&gt;**Skuld** The British love to complain. Especially about the USA, etc. It was getting boring seeing things like ""Americans don't know the correct plural of Lego"". I intended the subreddit to be more about trivial problems at home.

&gt;4.I've noticed that a lot of British problems involve politeness/modesty

&gt;&gt;**Ooer** The stereotypes are so true that it hurts. Every Brit has an eternal inner-being that is constantly worried about breaking social conventions

&gt;&gt;**Skuld** Yes

&gt;5.What is your top personal British problem?

&gt;&gt;**Ooer** Nothing generates more discussion between a group of British people than the following subjects;

&gt;&gt;* Adding milk to a cup of tea before or after the tea is poured.
&gt;&gt;* What the correct name for [these](http://i.imgur.com/3Cw2l.jpg) is
&gt;&gt;* The optimal biscuit for dunking in a cup of tea.
&gt;&gt;* Brown or red sauce on a bacon buttie.

&gt;&gt;However
To all the subscribers

&gt;&gt;**Skuld** My personal British problem is Northern Rail. I've been catching a train home for a year now

&gt;6.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Skuld** You're all wonderful people

****EDIT: THE INTERVIEW IS UP (SEE BELOW)****

---

Welcome to Day 5 of the Annual? (maybe like bi-annual or something) NSFW Week; and what an interesting week it has been. /r/passionx, I wanted to get a little more niche-y. You know, spice it up a little. Kinda like your mom uses tarragon and the ""cooking wine"" while she's cooking dinner; it makes her feel likes she's actually preparing a meal. 

---

I rolled over and looked at the clock. 5:15am. The red numbers on the clock flashed in the dark room. Too bright. It was one of those mornings where your body wakes up early because it has gotten in the habit of not sleeping past 7am. Do birds always get up this early? Ugh

 I tried to shake myself from the pulsing fuzz of tequila, they hit the chest of another body. Shit, don't be a dude, don't be a dude, I said to myself half jokingly. After letting my eyes adjust to the dark, I could make out the vague shape of what looked to be a girl. OH! it all cam back and hit me. Me and her had chatted each other up at the party the night before and then came back to my flat for some coffee. 

I find a strange comfort in the fact that people have to make up strange euphemisms like that to ask people to come home with them. Coffee, talk about family values. 

At this point she rolls over, hey."" She says with a half laugh. 

""Yeah, I reply with a chortle. A chortle? Come on Riley, get ahold of yourself. She already slept with you, no sense in being nervous now. I tried to turn on the charm a little, she was worth it after all. ""Want to put on some real coffee now? I'll take you out for ""hangover breakfast"" afterwards"". 

""Sounds like a plan, I notice that the sun is just starting to pour in through the window and fill the room. She was wearing a white, sheer night gown that wafts the intoxicating scent of the night before. The smell of primal urges, fabric softener, her perfume and a little weed.

 She turned and gave me a wink before making her way across the room. Right around the time she was passing by my growing stack of unread economist magazines and library books, and with as much honesty as you can give another person I asked, ""How are you feeling?"".

/r/WtSSTaDaMiT serves as THE portal to celebrate the beautiful phenomenon of ""When the Sun Shines Through a Dress and Makes it Transparent. This community scours the internet to bring you such classics as [""Blonde Hair, and one of my personal favorites, [""Orangered""](http://i.imgur.com/hm4jK.jpg). Turn you RES NSFW filter off for a little while and curl up next to the fire with a nice bottle of lotions, some tissues and this classy subreddit. It's a nice reprieve from the weird shit you beat off too regularly. Just saying. 

---

&gt;1.) Tell us about yourself: You guys have a pretty niche subreddit
&gt;&gt;Good question! It was made for popular demand, it was sort of just a joke I honestly didn't think it would get much attention, but it just took off and the name stuck.

&gt;2.) What's the community like: As a mod team, laissez-faire-modding some might say? 
&gt;&gt;We do indeed have rules, but very rarely this happens. I'd say we're pretty lenient on the rules here, considering there's not huge albums of these specific photos, but we have standards! I swear! I can't say we're a very busy group of mods, when we do get mod mail though we'll get right on it ASAP. So to answer, it's a low maintenance 'laissez-faire-modding' sub-reddit if you will. Mostly just spam filter eating peoples posts. :) 

&gt;3.) Ethics and Financial Philosophy: Would you take the opportunity to make a net profit of 1 trillion dollars (that's $1,000,000 folks) in a backdoor world market deal. The consequence of you taking the 1 trilly, is that the world economy with most likely bottom out for around 5 years, killing millions, starving countless, and rebooting the world economic system. After those 5 years the world rebounds and stabilizes and begins to rebuild. Would you take the trillion dollars (given the trillion dollars would retain it's value to you
&gt;&gt;CaptainTurtle: YES! With that kind of money I could put my plan into action... Disregard millions of people and destroying the economy! I would invest this money into helping the starving, rainy forrests... I would hire an elite team of the finest turtle catchers to find these turtles, put them into rehabilitation centers and provide food and shelter for them. In return they will regard me as Captain, and we will venture forth as one and eliminate any threats.

&gt;4.) Feelin' shameless?: Any other subreddits you would recommending our readers to start peeping at
&gt;&gt; CaptainTurtle: Well... heh heh.. I won't get too much into detail on this one because people know my account name... /r/notsafefornature is a great stress relieving sub-reddit ;). That is all.

&gt;5.) Let's get intimate: What's your personal favorite /r/WtSSTaDaMiT post? Maybe pour some chocolate syurp on yourself as you tell me? MMM that's how I like it.....cough oh excuse me
&gt;&gt; CaptainTurtle: Tough question... I'd have to go with this one

&gt;6.) Anything else you'd like to say about your community? (Events
&gt;&gt;CaptainTurtle: We're a quiet little sub-reddit

Here at Subreddit of the Day we don't make it a habit of featuring the same subreddit twice. We feel like providing you with fresh new, is muy importante! More over, we try not to feature huge subreddit that have more subscribers than some countries do citizens...(here's looking at you Liechtenstein)!

However, a simpler time....(*reminisce*). Today is 4/20, April the 20th, a day that is almost sacred to those who partake of the green herb known by many names: mary jane, pot, cannabis, wacky tobacky and what have you. Cannabis enthusiasts, set aside this day as their unofficial international holiday

[/r/Trees](/r/trees), and seen a great deal of activism, growth, drama and overall oneness as a community. Way to go ENTS!

In addition to being added to the default subreddit list (an accomplishment in itself), and it's ""proposed"" legalization. 

For those of you who are already subscribed to [/r/trees](/r/trees), to all, of the topical subs you could as for. From Tree-Meet ups to Pokents, this mutli-reddit list has it all! 

Regardless of where you stand on the marijuana legalization issue, laid back atmosphere and general lack of trolls. So hats off to these cats! Many of whom will be spending today in celebration of their appropriately ad hoc holiday.

I would highly suggest taking a look at the interview in that throwback, provided by my main man [/u/syncretic](http://www.reddit.com/user/syncretic) which can be found [***here***](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/ig4l6/july_4_2011_rtrees_a_refined_highclass_community/). The interview with the [/r/trees](/r/trees) mods alone makes me want to unsubscribe and then immediately resubscribe with 4 different throwaway accounts and my main account all at once!

For those of you who do celebrate the HOLIDAZE today

1.) Water is your best friend

2.) Don't bogard the bowl/joint/snacks

3.) Be excellent to each other; don't be afraid to tell fellow ents how radical they are. 

4.) Corner the bowl and pass to the left. Always. 

5.) Use Grooveshark/Spotify or any other equal opportunity music provider today. Let everyone jam their favorite tunes during 
the session and take turns DJ'ing.

6.) Trailer Park Boys, give 'em a watch. (Don't have netflix? PM me and tell me why I should give you my login!)

3. This [corporate holiday bullshit](/r/KarmaConspiracy) means nothing to you and does not effect you at all. Good on ya

/r/ForeverAlone was first just for the meme. But its grown more than that. Its become a beacon

&gt;#1 How did /r/ForeverAlone start? Or How did you end up here?

&gt;&gt;**/u/noonches** The meme had started to take off in the rage comics of f7u12. One user who's name completely escapes me said something along the lines of ""someone should make a subreddit for this depressing meme"" so I searched

&gt;&gt;**/u/airmandan** I have no idea; I was added by MWM one night and chose to stick around.

&gt;&gt;**/u/kreius** I was asked to help and gladly accepted to try and make it a more encouraging/inviting place for people to talk.

&gt;&gt;**/u/anutensil** My best guess is that I'm here through the good graces of ManWithoutModem.

&gt;&gt;**/u/DrFootcrab** I ended up here about a year ago. I can't really remember how I discovered it.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ooer** They dragged me here under cover of darkness. They keep me in a cold

&gt;&gt;**/u/snarkypants** I think i ended up here becaused i mod /r/lonely and /r/depressed too. It's right up my alley.

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem** The subreddit began one day when noonches spotted someone complaining in the great land of f7u12 about the large amount of depressing comics that were ending with the “forever alone” face. He went and made the subreddit /r/ForeverAlone

&gt;&gt;I ended up as a moderator a long time ago when I used to browse the subreddit for the horrible rage comics and self-deprecating humor in the early days. To say that the subreddit has evolved is a bit of an understatement.

&gt;#2 What makes /r/ForeverAlone special?

&gt;&gt;**noonches** The users like to make a community out of it. I feel like its a lot closer knit than other subreddit communities

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** It's a really great way to ruin a good mood.

&gt;&gt;**kreius** I think it's the fact that there are very few off-the-table discussions.

&gt;&gt;**anutensil** It seems to endue a sense of belonging.

&gt;&gt;**DrFootcrab** Foreveralone is special in that there's a really authentic honesty and vulnerability in the stuff that gets posted here and while we occasionally get trolls and people only here to stir shit it's one of the most pleasantly human subreddits I've ever seen.

&gt;&gt;**snarkypants**  They have their own unique trolls. Which i will ban on sight in a heartbeat to protect my fellow fa-ers. 

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** The fact that there are a ton of people that are different in a ridiculous amount of ways

&gt;#3 What is your favorite post so far?

&gt;&gt;**noonches** The many posts leading up to the eventual win of the tournament of memes.

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** I don't have one. This subreddit is really depressing to moderate. I haven't yet figured out yet if the users are a bunch of professional trolls, other than farming the queues and directing suicidal people to help lines and/or /r/suicidewatch, I don't interact much with our users.

&gt;&gt;**kreius** http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/riemj/forever_available/

&gt;&gt;**anutensil** Usually

&gt;&gt;**DrFootcrab** It's a crosspost but who gives a shit? http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/15m7xy/hopefully_this_may_change_a_few_outlooks_xpost/

&gt;&gt;**snarkypants**  My favorite one, and posted pics. 

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** 

&gt;#4 What post really hit home with you?

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** See answer to 3; after the hundredth suicide threat

&gt;&gt;**kreius** It was a great place to be and lurk while trying to work through my own problems last year.

&gt;&gt;**anutensil** Each hits home in its own way.

&gt;&gt;**DrFootcrab** They all do

&gt;&gt;**snarkypants** They all do... They all do. 

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem**

&gt;#5 Tell us a true ForeverAlone story that has happened to you.

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** I live in a shithole town in the south with a single gay bar that is a great place to go if you want to pick up STDs with your drink. I'm not happy with my appearance but because of the limited choices available to gay men in this area I don't really have much motivation to improve it. Then again...my sex life at least exists, and shouldn't complain too much.

&gt;&gt;**anutensil** I can't right now

&gt;&gt;**DrFootcrab** One time when I was I think a freshman or sophomore in high school a girl that I was hitting on told me that we couldn't hang out because she was moving to Mexico in a month. I saw her at the mall a few months later and walked into the closest store (build-a-bear) to avoid her seeing me.

&gt;&gt;**snarkypants** Back in high school My junior prom date picked me up with a hickey on his neck from another girl

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem**

&gt;#6 Tell us about your community. And where you see /r/ForeverAlone in the future?

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** To be frank, too.

&gt;&gt;**kreius** I think FA has a bright future helping those

&gt;&gt;**anutensil** It's going to be turned into a movie and impact cultures universally forever and ever.

&gt;&gt;**DrFootcrab** Transitioning into its natural role as a sex robot advice / reviews hub for the future internet.

&gt;&gt;**snarkypants** I see a lot of former forever aloners coming back

**19

The astute readers among you knew this would be coming. It was only a day ago that EVE saw that may be the biggest battle in game history; a brutal war between Reddit, EVE Online is one that everyone can enjoy. Indeed, [the associated thread  in /r/Games](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/17cp5t/2000_man_fight_going_on_in_eve_online_honey/) has drawn many to its plutonian shores, with visions of supercarriers dancing in their heads. It's more than just a game, though; it's an entire universe. As the intro points out, there are many paths to greatness. One of those paths is in commanding fleets of awesome spaceships and ordering them to kill everything else.

I am beyond the word ""new"" to the world of EVE. I have tried it before on an older computer, and so I switched to WoW. Now, armed with a better (not by much) laptop, I'm here again. The result? I'm hooked!

/r/EVE has been playing for many years, gods among kings. Their warships crown the cosmos in their name, hoisting TEST flags across all sections of the universe. A billion suns burn in their names, and angelic beings of old play their song on sweet harps of gold. I was granted audience with these protobeings, who so offered to answer my questions.

Today we got a special treat for ya'll. Instead of *just* questioning the moderators

&gt;#1. Of all games

&gt;&gt;**Tezasaurus - Dreddit Director** Life in Eve can vary wildly depending on what you decide you want to do in it; if you are a market/spreadsheet nerd

&gt;&gt;**Cogswick - TEST CEO** Life in Eve is varied. There are so many possibilities of what you can do. For example
&gt;&gt;
The best part about Eve is that everything is connected. My alliance running around out in Nullsec fighting over neo moons or dropping all of our supercaps into a lowsec system to kill an old friend wouldn't be possible if it were not for the people in hisec mining the minerals that our supercap builders compress and move to nullsec where supers can be built.

&gt;#2. Eve looks to be peaceful

&gt;&gt;**Tezasaurus - Dreddit Director** There is always drama. If there isn't any naturally-occurring drama in the game

&gt;&gt;**Cogswick - TEST CEO** Eve Online could probably be called Drama Online. Dreddit (the reddit corp over on /r/evedreddit) and its alliance TEST Alliance Please Ignore absolutely thrive on drama. If we aren't causing drama in spaceship politics
&gt;&gt;
Most recently there has been a lot of drama surrounding the relationship between the CFC (clusterfuck coalition) and the HBC (honeybadger coalition), and since the creation of the HBC as a full and separate entity, the HBC and CFC have coexisted just fine together with a simple non-invasion pact that protected each others sources of income and space. Lately that relationship broke down for various reasons. There was a lot of drama, enough to have its own thread on kugu and be featured in several articles on themittani.com and en24. The result was that Montolio, the leader of test, stepped down temporarily leaving me, Fras

&gt;#3. As is the case with all PC games

&gt;&gt;**Tezasaurus - Dreddit Director** I use an Alienware tower that I actually won from CCP in a video contest; i7 3.2GHz, I get something like 120+ fps, but larger battles can crush it all the way down to 15.

&gt;&gt;**Cogswick - TEST CEO** Eve performance is pretty much subjective not just to your computer but to the situation in Eve. I have a pretty ""standard"" rig. AMD 1090T, and two 23"" widescreen monitors. If I'm flying around on my own, I'll probably turn everything up all the way to enjoy the amazing eye candy (http://i.imgur.com/Oh2F1.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/stveG.jpg). When things are intense like when you have 2700 people in one system and most of them are supercarriers/carriers with lots and lots of drones, I'll turn things down but even then the game is still super pretty (http://i.imgur.com/jdH6r.jpg). You just have to not forget like I did last night (http://i.imgur.com/WwmLXcC.jpg). I went from 40 fps to about 20 frames a minute before I turned off all the brackets.

&gt;&gt;**Tezasaurus - Dreddit Director** Find a corporation to join! Eve is unforgiving, along with a huge stock of free ships, modules, and skillbooks plus dedicated chatrooms for newbros filled with helpful people to answer 'dumb' questions without fear of some random asshat in our alliance mocking them. Simply having people to talk to and walk you through the early complexities of the game and avoid common early mistake is invaluable. 80% of our fleets are newbie-friendly, too; combine that with free ships and there were no doubt many players in their first week (possibly even their first day) of the game who got to experience the huge battle that happened yesterday.

&gt;&gt;**Cogswick - TEST CEO** Play the tutorials and don't give up. The tutorial system is much better now than it was when I first started playing in 2006. Play through them, so try and find a group of like minded individuals and have fun.
&gt;&gt;
I highly recommend that people try pvp as soon as they can. Everyone matters

Truly inspiring. Really, though, and a little bit of work in the beginning can grant you a whole lot of fun later.

Is dream. Farm is confiscate by politburo and man is in transport to Siberia.* [[X]](http://www.reddit.com/r/LatvianJokes/comments/1e324s/latvian_is_gather_harvest/)

It may be difficult for the uninitiated to understand the humor behind a Latvian Joke. Just squint at it for a second and think to yourself *this is an honest and sincere tale of someone's life*. Believe me

&gt;*Two farmers working in the field. One says to the other

/r/LatvianJokes is your go-to place for funny stories about a dark topic. The essence of most Latvian Jokes is the hopeless struggle between man finding food in an overly unforgiving, usually, of course, a potato.

&gt;*Two latvian look at clouds. One see potato. Other see impossible dream. Is same cloud.* [[X]](http://www.reddit.com/r/LatvianJokes/comments/17113q/cloud/)

The awful but endearing writing style is cute

&gt;##What is it about Latvian jokes that you find to be so funny?

&gt;&gt; **scamperly** I like that they are anti-jokes. Like a darker anti-joke chicken. Very dry humour

&gt;&gt; **jeremyfrankly** Latvian jokes are the polar opposite of First World Problem jokes. Whereas those jokes affirm your status through relatability

&gt;##Latvian jokes can be very dark. How do you feel about all of the violence in many Latvian jokes?

&gt;&gt; **jeremyfrankly** While Latvian jokes do make mention of dark themes like violence and rape, to be fair, not necessarily in Latvia).

&gt;&gt; **scamperly** I don't like the direction they have taken, it was a all a dream/hallucination from malnourish"". The violence I am ok with, I like to let the jokes evolve naturally.

&gt;##How has your moderating experience been on /r/LatvianJokes? How do you keep your populace under control?

&gt;&gt; **scamperly** I found a latvian joke on /r/funny and loved it so much I wanted more, or put it to the community. The subscribers were great in self-censoring potato pictures and returning to the bleak, cold roots of Latvian Jokes. The subreddit was turning into only pictures of potatoes, and we wanted it to get back to jokes with occasional potato pictures, which the community has successfully accomplished without strict enforcement.

&gt;&gt; **jeremyfrankly** Moderating /r/LatvianJokes is tricky. The biggest issue we've encountered is an over-reliance on potatoes as both setup and punchline. People seem to incorrectly think that all Latvian jokes must center around potatoes

&gt;&gt; As for my moderation style, unquestionable dictatorship.

&gt;##Share your favorite Latvian joke.

&gt;&gt; **jeremyfrankly** Ooh

&gt;&gt;&gt;What is difference between Latvian and lemming? Latvian know why he jump off cliff.

**52

Soccer, futebol, etc. It's a wonderful sport. One of the oldest and probably the most well known international sport. It's a shame the love of soccer hasn't quite made its way to the US yet. I have a feeling it will soon though.

Being that it's big sub and all, and you happen to be a subscriber of /r/subredditoftheday here you goooo!!! YAYAYAYA!

So if you haven't visited /r/soccer and you do keep up with your league

Now with the start of the Euros

So

So without further ado...

&gt;##1. Where in the world are you from and what club and national team do you support?

&gt;&gt; **spisska** From Washington DC, and Slovak National Team.

&gt;&gt; **thekrone** Ann Arbor, I know, I'm a terrible American).

&gt;&gt; **spinney** Cincinnati

&gt;&gt; **9jack9** I'm from North London and support Arsenal. I support England but only when they are doing well

&gt;&gt; **_sic** Tenerife

&gt;&gt; **reyofish** From England

&gt;##2. Which league(s) do you find the most interesting to watch?

&gt;&gt; **spisska** MLS, Mexican Primera.

&gt;&gt; **thekrone** The English Premier League

&gt;&gt; **spinney** The English Premier League has all the drama and quality to make it the must watch league for me. However if you are new to the sport I'd suggest checking out the German Bundesliga. The teams are more equal and the league is set up for the future.

&gt;&gt; **9jack9** I follow the Premier League and Champions League mainly but thanks to /r/soccer I'm in touch with the other major leagues too.

&gt;&gt; **_sic** La Liga

&gt;&gt; **reyofish** The EPL - it is awesome as was proven last season.

&gt;##3. What all is there to do/find in /r/soccer?

&gt;&gt; ** spisska ** News, and all manner of discussion around the game from all over the world. Topics include everything from team news, rules and officiating, tactics, transfers, and so on from all levels of league and competition. Match Threads are a particular feature.

&gt;&gt; **thekrone** Stuff about soccer

&gt;&gt; **spinney** During the week there are all sorts of videos, is when this place really comes alive. We have match threads for most of the big games where you can find some fun banter and serious game discussion. We also have fantasy leagues for when the major leagues are in season and right now we have a Euro 2012 fantasy for this summer.

&gt;&gt; **9jack9** Our description reads: News

&gt;&gt; **_sic** Why football news and discussion of course, gloating about victories over hated rivals, reliving past glories and developing conspiracy theories about referees. You know, just regular football stuff.

&gt;&gt; **reyofish** /r/soccer has changed over the years. It was once a barren place where very few posted. It has exploded into one of the best talking shops on the internet

&gt;##4. What do you do as a mod?

&gt;&gt; ** spisska ** A group this large (~53k) could very easily and quickly get out of hand. Fortunately the moderators here (of whom I am hardly the sharpest or most active) strive to preserve a very high signal-to-noise ratio by preventing duplicate submissions, rage-comics, etc), and rescuing worthy posts from the spam bot.


&gt;&gt; **thekrone** Mostly sit in the new / spam queues and move things from one to the other appropriately. Respond to user questions / messages / reports. Try to keep the peace.

&gt;&gt; **spinney** Before I got busy with work I tried to be the guy to change the banner picture and keep it fresh. I've been slacking in that department as of late

&gt;&gt; **9jack9** I look after the technical side of things. I maintain the CSS

&gt;&gt; **_sic** Remove memes

&gt;&gt; **reyofish** Mostly

&gt;##5. What do you love most about modding?

&gt;&gt; **spisska** Helping to maintain the astonishingly high level of quality that exists in this forum, they also actively help to maintain quality.

&gt;&gt; **thekrone** Just a sense of pride in the community that I've helped shape for a few years.

&gt;&gt; **spinney** Been a mod since the admins granted it to a few of the users after the old mod went MIA. Been probably 3 or 4 years now and it's nice to see what the community has grown into

&gt;&gt; **9jack9** I enjoy seeing the changes I make put to good use. I recently added some [icons](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/rerge/icons_for_match_threads/) for our match threads. The [results](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/ue4nw/match_thread_france_vs_serbia_international/) are very pleasing. :)


&gt;&gt; **_sic** Removing stupid memes that if left unchecked would blot out all other content. Seeing a front page filled with good content and many comments.

&gt;&gt; **reyofish** In /r/soccer it has to be watching Severed rip a noob or a moron a new one

&gt;##6. Predictions for the Euros?

&gt;&gt; **spisska** Germany and Spain are favorites
But here are some predictions:

* Group A: Greece and Czech Republic advance

* Group B: Portugal pulls of some shock results and either Germany or Netherlands fall at the group stage. Denmark causes a scare

* Group C: Spain wins comfortably, and fails for the second tournament in a row to escape the groups. Across Italy there is a wailing and gnashing of teeth. Croatia advance.

* Group D: England falls at the group stage; France and Sweden advance. Roy Hodgson is tarred, making his tenure of 36 days among the shortest since [Kevin Cullis’ one-and-a-half game sting at Swansea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cullis).


&gt;&gt; **thekrone** Germany #1. Spain #2. Netherlands #3. France #4.

&gt;&gt; **spinney** It's hard to look past Germany this year

&gt;&gt; **9jack9** Probably not England.

&gt;&gt; **_sic** Spain wins again!

&gt;&gt; **reyofish** Hate to say it but Germany or Holland. Would love England to do it but ... Three Lions on the shirt and all that.

Happy Thursday

###Prologue

(Imagine reading the below in yellow font in space moving away from you but with a cool perspective lean.)

When the royal we first featured /r/Starwars it was actually very early on in /r/SROTD's own life. Back then we just mentioned the subreddit and thats it. Honest, **33,333** storm troopers to be exact. [Thats a lot of clones.](http://i.imgur.com/xHoxS.png) 

###Retro Week

If you still haven't figured it out by now

###Disclaimer

Lets get the disclaimer out the way, the head honcho aka the quiet one. Wazow, the ever present. Ugnaught, first of the new blood, and vanquisher of bad posts. JSK23 &amp; raraahahah, I like to call them the spam slicing twins. FrankReynolds, the photoshop artist. And finally yours truly, advisor to Noche on all official matters and all alround nice guy. 

###The Juicy Bit

Now that formalities are out the way we can get down to business. Star Wars as a whole, memorabilia volcano, muse to many a great [cosplays](http://i.imgur.com/C70Mt.jpg), brand merchandise behemoth and an American treasure. Its Americana at its purest. Its raw uncut high quality american made cocaine in 1080p format. Did you know there is actually a resolution bigger than 1080p now? [Its called 4K](http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/07/whats-bigger-than-1080p-4k-video-comes.html) for short but the reso is actually 4096 x 2304 pixels. And you better believe ol'chubby Locus is going to re-re-re-release all his movies. And we're all going to re-re-re-rebuy it. Cause we love that *shit*. And consumerism! And and [A-MER-RI-CA, FUCK YEAH!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWS-FoXbjVI ""Seriously, Team America World Police is a brilliant movie."")

Now you would ask, and we just recently passed 30,000. In comparison r/pics past a million how long ago? Exactly. Its ridiculous, as [zoidberg](/r/zoidberg) would joyfully say, ""Its /r/StarWars time to be the popular one! and a whoop whoop whoop for good measure!"" b) I bet you thought I'd forget about b didn't you? Be honest. I didn't. Let this be a reminder to all those who doubted me &amp; the letter b. c) Well, today *is* May 4th, Official Starwars day so

[How many times have you come across a star wars related post on reddit](http://i.imgur.com/sy8re.jpg) and wondered, so stop trying to repel awesomeness of that [magnitude](/r/community). 

#####A little poem from me to you.

    Three years dedicated for one purpose
    Seven Knighted Jedi watch from above
    Nine hundred years was the age of the wise
    One Darth Lord sat on his dark throne
    In a galaxy far far away where the Sith lie.
    One subreddit to rule them all
    One subreddit to bring them all and in the enlightenment bind them
    In a galaxy far far away where the Sith lie.


[Star Wars](http://i.imgur.com/Mtalr.gif) you'll always be my chosen one. I had [loved you](http://i.imgur.com/xohrN.gif)

#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

#####Shy StarWars nerds are shy. Finally got some questions answered...

#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;#1. Tell us your favorite starwars related story to happen to you personally.

&gt;&gt;**JSK23** My favorite memories entail spreading Star Wars love among my younger siblings. I got them in to the action figures when they were younger. The joy of watching them open up their first POTF2 figures was awesome. We watched the VHS tapes together. When the DVDs came out we got a bunch of joke food and pop and watched all 6 movies on one Sunday after noon. We played the games together from KotoR to Jedi Knight

&gt;&gt;**FrankReynolds** I'd have to say that my favorite Star Wars memory was seeing the re-releases in theaters with my mother. We didn't have a lot of money growing up and my mom worked three jobs to support me and my sisters all by herself

&gt;&gt;**Noche** Seeing the original movie back in the 70's at the drive-in. I will never forget the amazement I felt as I watched in awe. Even though I'm older now

&gt;#2. As a mod of StarWars what has been the biggest challenge for you?

&gt;&gt;**Noche** The challenges have been handled daftly and superbly by everyone on the team. Jax has been instrumental in taking the reddit to where it is today. Back when it was started

&gt;#3. How's the year been? Can you summarize the past 12 months for us?

&gt;&gt;**FrankReynolds** The last year has been really good for Star Wars in my opinion. The Blu-ray release brought not only HD Star Wars

&gt;&gt;**Noche** Reddit-wise,000 and climbing. I've watched the growth of the reddit along with the growth of the community and it seems in the past year it has grown at a pace exceeding the previous years. I attribute this to talented, hard working mods and loyal Star Wars fans.

&gt;#4. End the debate

&gt;&gt;**FrankReynolds** Darth Vader? He's definitely a bad ass. The most bad ass? Probably. I'd love to see a Vader vs. Bane duel.

&gt;&gt;**Noche** Darth Vader is the OG and in my mind the most bad ass.

&gt;#5. Open Mic. Say what you want this is your chance.

&gt;&gt;**JSK23**  I think there is too much prequel bashing

&gt;&gt;**FrankReynolds** Open mic: I enjoy the prequels and think Episode 3 is better than 6. I saw Ep1 in 3D and thoroughly enjoyed it. I plan on seeing 2

No, rusty trains and [empty cinemas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Airbender) are only a few of the many examples of things you will find there. Why is that beauty, you may ask? They are all created by nature itself, but instead of the sky or mountains, nature used human built places.

Adjacent to the left side of the forest, which stood there proudly behind the first couple of trees. 
Whenever I walked with my dog in the forest we came along the mansion, fascinated. 
I never had the guts to go inside until one day, I'm a spoiler!*

And now an interview with moderator , moderator /u/kjoneslol and creator saldejums!








&gt;##1.What    is    the    beauty    of    abandoned    places   or    things?
&gt;&gt;    **Soupyhands**    I think the main attraction is to see how the structure has fared since it has been unoccupied. Some of these places look very scary and the thought of being in a spot which hasn't seen people in years is extremely compelling.

&gt;&gt;    **kjoneslol**    Abandoned places show what happens when humans stop interfering. It can have profound effects like vegetation engulfing an old rusted car that shows you the true beauty and power of nature. I think there's also some truth to the fact that we live in these places so it's somewhat surprising to see them empty. It's not common to see a place like

&gt;&gt;    **saldejums**    The feeling that it was done for the cause, unwanted, unused, unowned, forgotten and sometimes even bothersome as rape child of slacky mother. That's the thrill of urban exploration and rediscovering things left forgotten.

&gt;##2.How did you came up with the idea to create /r/AbandonedPorn
&gt;&gt;   **Soupyhands**    I joined AbandonedPorn almost a year ago

&gt;&gt;    **kjoneslol**    I was added to the subreddit just to help with the queue since it got included in to the SFWPorn Network. I am generally added to every subreddit in the network to help with css/modqueue.

&gt;&gt;    **saldejums**    As creator, so I wanted to share with photos of abandoned places, particularly, the Karosta, and see what others have under their sleeves. Somehow it grew together with sfwporn network and now it is probably one of 150 most popular subreddits out there.

&gt;##3.What is a post you think is porn worthy?
&gt;&gt;   **Soupyhands**    Anything which has been abandoned.

&gt;&gt;    **kjoneslol**    Probably what I said earlier

&gt;&gt;    **saldejums**    Unique, but if you are urban explorer, even the sewer shaft is hottest model of the eve.

&gt;##4.If you needed to choose 1 abandoned place in which you needed to live
&gt;&gt;   **Soupyhands**    [Probably this crazy place](http://i.imgur.com/URcme.jpg)

&gt;&gt;    **kjoneslol**    San Zhi, that just require a population. Throw in me and some buddies and we could have a sustainable city up and running in no time.

&gt;&gt;    **saldejums**     Latvia, largest city in Baltics and one-of-largest in Northern Europe, under the Press house (Preses nams), one of the largest bomb shelters in the region, full with isolating air filtration system able to upkeep hundreds of people isolated from outside for months, with many escape routes, electricity

&gt;##5.Many of the mods are seen in other SFW porn subreddits. How come?
&gt;&gt;    **Soupyhands**    The SFWPorn Network subreddits all have similar rules so those of us who spend lots of time on reddit and understand all the main SFWPorn rules are around to assist subscribers. We also help to implement design changes and make cross-network announcements when required.

&gt;&gt;    **kjoneslol**    Aside from what soupyhands already said


&gt;&gt;    **saldejums**    That is the network. You sacrifice your child for the greater good, each jerking off at Rooms, Animals, Macro, Abandoned and other porns that are out there. Some are in cozy rooms, other are in abandoned factories, some in the forest jerking off the trees, some swimming with the fish or enjoy really great advertisements. The Porn overlords are elected through magic

&gt;##6.Do you want to say anything? 
&gt;&gt;  **Soupyhands**      To the subscribers, we are looking forward to a prosperous future. To all of the moderators, thanks for volunteering your time and effort to keep the subreddit running     smoothly!

&gt;&gt;    **kjoneslol**    Gonna have to say thanks to the subscribers &amp; submitters. This subreddit has regularly been one of the most active subreddits in the network and features a load of quality original content.--wouldn't be the same without them.

&gt;&gt;    **saldejums**    Explore! Do what you like! Ignore trespassing signs and let the hungry hounds be no obstacle for your journey

Enjoy your Saturday!

Sorry guys

I love how things just fall into place sometimes. Yesterday I featured /r/comicbooks. Great subreddit btw, anywhere in between or even just an end user (that means customer). If you think about it, they're almost the same thing, except they're not. Comic books deals with stories with fictional characters dealing with issues and iiiiiiitttttttttttt deals with *sometimes* fictional characters dealing with issues. Yup totally different. You see what I did there? Oh yeah, totally intentional, baby.

**Forgive me

For all those wondering

&gt;##1. What made you create /r/iiiiiiitttttttttttt? What was the boiling point?

&gt;&gt; **otakuman** Something bad happened at my IT-related work that made me furious. I made a rage comic about it and found it pretty funny, there was none.

&gt;&gt; I couldn't believe it. So I went to r/talesfromtechsupport and asked them. One of them told me it was my duty to make one. Challenge accepted. The rest

&gt;##2. How many of the mods are actually in IT or similar workplaces? Please tell us 1 of your worst stories.

&gt;&gt; **otakuman** . I think all but one, yes, I still have to make a ragecomic about it. I went to this company that paid a gazillion as salary, and their requirements were like climbing the Everest. I had to make a C++ exam, and I passed. The job was developing a web application in an in-house implementation of an archaic programming language, adapted from a programming book's ""example exercise"". Various employees had asked the boss to change the requirements and use PHP because the language implementation was horrible (no break statements, no garbage collection, who was one of the owners

&gt;&gt; **Addyct** I once had to debug someone's desktop for them. No, and it was causing his computer to overheat. Upon arriving, I opened up the side, and there was a huge dead wasp wedged in the CPU cooler fan, preventing it from spinning. I don't know how it got in there, or where it came from, but I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

&gt;&gt; **Joseph445** I do not work in IT but I am good with computers and am surrounded by people who are not.

&gt;##3. Rage face comics have become a second language amongst redditors

&gt;&gt; **otakuman** We're making some at r/i7t12faces

&gt;##4. Besides IT crowd and Office Space

&gt;&gt; **otakuman**  Hmmmm I don't know. Wait

&gt;##5. Why do you think IT people are treated so poorly? How did being IT become synonymous for having no feelings?

&gt;&gt; **otakuman**   I'm not sure, I'm very picky about my future jobs.

&gt;&gt; **Addyct**  I'm very tempted to just say that all people are assholes at all times, because now they have to stop what they're doing and track us down to fix it. God forbid they think it's actually something that we did to them (YOU SCANNED MY COMPUTER FOR VIRUSES LAST WEEK AND NOW IT'S DOESN'T WORK RIGHT, IT'S YOUR FAULT!).

&gt;##6. I wanted to ask about your community and anything else you'd like to mention.

&gt;&gt; **otakuman**  As it's a very young community, I'm pretty overwhelmed with the response we've got. It got more than 1000 readers on 2 days, and we've reached **OVER 9,000!!!!!** in less than 3 weeks :)

&gt;&gt; It's a wonderful community. I don't think I can express my gratitude to the readers for this. It made me realize I can actually do amazing things if I put my heart on it. It's a wonderful boost for my self-esteem. Thank you all!

&gt;&gt;Oh yeah. Forgot to mention. We're constantly accepting submissions for the header image. Our plan is to rotate them each month.

This dastardly fiend is the cause for the creation of the brilliant subreddit /r/ThanksObama
          
So have a seat
            
I can't think of anything else to write. Thanks Obama.

&gt;##1. What is /r/ThanksObama all about?

     
&gt;&gt;**kvachon**: Blaming any and everything on our tyrant of a democratically elected ""president"". From taxes to debt, and more, Thanks Obama.  
     
&gt;&gt;**MyNameIsHax**: Blaming that bastard Obama for all that he's (not) caused.


    

&gt;##2. What inspired you to create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**kvachon**: Honestly? I created this based on how ridiculous the political scene was (and still is) when it comes to complaining about President Obama. Politics aside



   
&gt;##3. Favorite ""Thanks Obama"" gif/image?




&gt;&gt;**kvachon**: http://imgur.com/BaqXIrI - easily the best one yet.    
     
&gt;&gt;**MyNameIsHax**: [I like this one a lot](http://i.imgur.com/JlALW.gif)





&gt;##4. Best part about being a moderator of this subreddit?


 

&gt;&gt;**kvachon**: For me


    
&gt;&gt;**MyNameIsHax**: Best part is seeing all the submissions first





&gt;##5. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

The title's quote comes from Shakespeare's *Hamlet* from a scene where Hamlet is despairing at the state of humanity and his inability to appreciate the beauty of [space](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/54345main_ic1396_highres.jpg). 

And oh, thanks to modern advances in technology, our interest in space has borne [more fruitful discoveries and inventions](http://images.channelone.com/img/2007/03/farout_inventions_l.jpg) (and delightful [""oddities""](http://youtu.be/KaOC9danxNo)) than our ancestors' [fantastical musings](http://www.orgoknight.com/resources/Astrology_home_page.JPG) about the stars. 

But despite all we know about [space and our universe](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg/600px-CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg)

For some

Here, and of course, [lots of space gifs/images](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OLCMMGoSOs4/UP13JtDW7cI/AAAAAAAAF2M/vwcAqJjaJA4/w497-h373/space.gif).
The community itself is largely only active and talkative when major stories are broken or exceptionally interesting content is posted

Here today to talk more about the about /r/Space are three of its mods

&gt;#1. How did you first become interested in space?

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** My class had a field trip to the local observatory when I was in Grade 6. They have a 1.83m Plaskett telescope, which began my relationship with Science Fiction. Since then I have enjoyed reading Astronomy and Popular Science, and for the couple of decades, keeping track of new developments in astrophysics via the web.


&gt;&gt;**relic2279** I've been fascinated with space since I was little. Watching ST:TNG back in the 80's when I was at an impressionable age probably impacted my interest the most.

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** I first became interested in space when I was a young child

&gt;#2. Are any of you involved in the aerospace industry?

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** No

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** Nope

&gt;#3. What are your thoughts on Chris Hadfield's use of social media during his stay on the International Space Station?

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** Generating public interest in space research is key to making sure this type of thing receives proper funding in the future. I commend Chris Hadfield on his insight and solution to this continuing dilemma. Also he is Canadian so he gets props from me automatically.


&gt;&gt;**relic2279** I think it's great

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** I thought that his use of social media was incredible. It was a great way to promote science to a younger generation.


&gt;#4. What do you think the future of space exploration looks like?

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** First of all, tow them back to earth and mine them in orbit, that would be huge for our species as a whole. We would no longer need to develop the earth and rob it of its natural resources for space travel. Boosting payloads is so unbelievably expensive that this type of thing almost has to happen for space exploration to be feasible. I would love to see a moon colony or a mars colony within my lifetime.


&gt;&gt;**relic2279** It's hard to say. I definitely see a robust private industry in the future. My hope is that competition in the private industry will drive innovation. I'd love to see the cost of getting to space drop significantly.

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** I think the future looks bright. Mars will be explored by humans sooner or later

&gt;#5. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** Thanks for your submissions and comments!

*Cheers*. *Seinfeld*. *Friends*. For years, television. But ever since the cancellation of its critically acclaimed but short-lived masterpiece, *Joey*,\* NBC's ""must see TV"" prime time schedule has wanted for shows that anyone might actually want to see. Thankfully, all of that changed in the Fall of 2009 when *Community* took to the airwaves.

Now in its third season, got the axe many a moon ago by another network. Hopefully NBC doesn't make the same mistake that Fox did, but perhaps it's precisely because that sword of Damocles hangs ever so tenuously that *Community's* fans have become such a tight-nit group.

There's no better example of the show's rabid followers then at /r/community

*That was sarcasm

&gt;I hate the entire cast of this show

&gt;&gt;**roger_**: How the hell can you hate Chevy Chase

&gt;&gt;Okay, interesting and of course funny characters of any show in the last few years (yes, even including Shirley). Also the writing is clever and witty, but not too pretentious for a good poop joke.

&gt;&gt;**joeyisapest**: I love the characters in the show.. The actors add a ton of improv and ""spunk"" to their characters. The show may not be for everyone. I would reccomend this show because it is more experimental and different from most other sitcoms.

&gt;&gt;To see some of the ""concept"" episodes check out:

&gt;&gt;S1E23 ""Modern Warfare""

&gt;&gt;S2E04 ""Basic rocket science""

&gt;&gt;S2E06 ""epidemiology""

&gt;&gt;S2E14 ""Advanced dungeons and dragons""

&gt;&gt;Also the creator of Community

&gt;Suppose that I still hate this show. Give me a link to a YouTube video that will change my mind. 

&gt;&gt;**roger_**: That's a tough question since there are so many awesome scenes. Here're three (somewhat random ones) that should show you the error of your ways: [one](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcpxn2_community-troy-and-abed-in-the-morn_fun)

&gt;&gt;**joeyisapest**: Some short clips that I think give a good feel of community are these: [this funny dialogue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2odOu0Oguo)

&gt;You've nearly convinced me. Before I commit

&gt;&gt;**roger_**: Personally I don't mind if people post memes and what not, but now the cast members all have their own subreddits.

&gt;&gt;**joeyisapest**: I don't always handle memes.. but when I do .. I Britta up the whole Bacon Narwhal and drink my own piss..

&gt;&gt;We haven't had a ton of memes.. We get a ton of screen-shots from the tv show with subtitles. I Don't mind them at all they are entertaining and that's what reddit is all about.

&gt;Since you're a big bat

&gt;&gt;**roger_**: Any time

&gt;Several of your favorite show's stars have done IAMAs already. Grade them.

&gt;&gt;**roger_**: I feel like this is a homework assignment. I'm gonna pretend you said ""rank them"" instead: Dan Harmon, Danny Pudi (sorry Danny).

&gt;&gt;**joeyisapest**: All the AMAs were good

&gt;On /r/subredditoftheday we like to highlight subreddits that have a sense of *community*. You *are* /r/community. Your thoughts?

&gt;&gt;**roger_**: (Lemme think about this)

&gt;&gt;**joeyisapest**: The community community is a great community. I'd literally jump in front of a downvote for any one of the /r/community readers.

&gt;&gt;~/r/NoFap is a venue for redditors to openly discuss the many potential benefits of NOT masturbating for a period of time.

&gt;*Try it (for just a week) and see if you feel a difference. Or don't--and I promise

-----

In June, which stated a 45.7% increase in testosterone after one week of orgasm abstinence, paved the way for the Reddit NoFap movement. In response, the subreddit /r/NoFapJuly was created. Shortly after, /r/NoFapJuly and its constituents realized that they were sadly limited to only a twelfth of the year. So, they cut off the unnecessary 'July', leaving /r/NoFap as the permanent wellspring of fapstinence.

To this day, despite its popularity and growth, has reached a high level of infamy with the rest of Reddit's communities. Those who oppose /r/NoFap frequently claim that ""it is sad that Redditor's have such a hard time not masturbating that they need a subreddit to incentive them from doing it"". They say that /r/NoFap is pseudoscientific--some even go as far as to say [a cult](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/rcceu/is_rnofap_a_cult/). This is the famous *Reddit NoFap controversy*.

/r/NoFap's opposition tends to forget its innocent creation, was the force that launched a small group into an experimental, self-improvement commitment. The results of this experiment turned out generally positive--and the anecdotal response of the test subjects were even more convincing. Quickly, [scientific explanations](http://yourbrainonporn.com) were integrated and the whole thing was mashed together as a promising source of confidence, easy (in theory) self-improvement, and a possible new mindset on life.

Not only was this attractive to the [stereotypical socially-awkward Redditor](http://i.imgur.com/VK8PpLz.jpg)

There are numerous benefits that doing NoFap has been claimed to hold--improved confidence, as well. Whether the affects of NoFap are a placebo or based in scientific fact, one thing is for certain: [people feel a difference](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/uyg9r/nofap_really_will_make_you_a_chick_magnet_yes/).

-----

Here's an interview with a few of the /r/NoFap moderators:

&gt;##What benefits do you receive by not masturbating?

&gt;&gt; **FaplessAndFancyFree** As we say on this sub every day, NoFap has been thanked for everything from improving personal energy and focus to repairing the way participants view women -- which I think is fairly plausible for many of our subscribers. On the other hand, it's been thanked for curing baldness and acne because of something to do with zinc deposits -- which I think is rather less plausible.

&gt;&gt;Everyone sets off on their NoFap journey for different reasons, some for 90 days, some for a lifetime. Some just want a challenge; others want to learn how to masturbate without porn. Some want to overcome erection challenges and see hope for that here. Some are disturbed by how porn and masturbation are shaping their lives, their relationships, their sexuality, or how they view the opposite sex. Some think that they could unlock hidden potential by quitting masturbation and devoting that time and mental energy to other pursuits, or just by learning the self-discipline NoFap demands. Some think masturbation is just plain stupid, or even immoral, losers! That was a pointless waste of 90 days of my life! This is stupid and I didn't see any benefits!""

&gt;&gt;Of course

&gt;&gt; **Camp_Olympia** The benefits really vary from person to person. Some people see complete turn arounds in their lives, a way to combat what a person feels is an addiction, to get some more time to study, to help repair a relationship with an SO, among other things. The consensus around /r/nofap is that the main benefit people see is an increase in social activity.

&gt;&gt; **Alexanderr** The benefits seem to range from absolutely zero to life changing. Every user is here for their own unique reasons: a personal challenge of willpower, for the lulz, erectile dysfunction, to find a significant other, etc. Because of this, every user stands to experience different benefits.

&gt;##Explain the science behind these benefits.

&gt;&gt; **Alexanderr** We are the experimental group. There is very little tangible research available on this subject. Hopefully that will change soon! I recommend checking out [yourbrainonporn.com](http://yourbrainonporn.com) for a semi-scientific analysis of why some of us abstain from masturbation.

&gt;&gt; **Camp_Olympia** The sad thing is is that there really isn't much science behind the benefits. Masturbation remains a pretty taboo subject

&gt;&gt; **FaplessAndFancyFree** The state of masturbation science is very poor. Sexology, masturbation, and all other sexual acts (oral sex, bagpiping, etc.) are identical in physiological and psychological impact. Virtually every study you've ever seen that earned a BBC headline or a Wikipedia citation saying, ""Masturbation is good for you!"" didn't study masturbation at all. Instead, they found that sexually active people received certain benefits, ""masturbation is good for you!""

&gt;&gt;In fact, fairly conclusively, that (1) masturbation won't kill you (or cause any obvious physical harm like blindness), and (2) masturbation won't drive you insane. (I've lost my link to the original study, but it is mentioned briefly [here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27505405), on p.189.) And, of course, but have sometimes found [opposite results](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19016689)). The best thing you can say about masturbation, David F. &amp; Karen E. Whittaker. (1991). “The Role of Masturbation in Marital and Sexual Satisfaction: A Comparative Study of Female Masturbators and nonmasturbators.” Journal of Sex Education and Therapy, in the end. Or they may be wrong. All I know is that I'm not placing my trust in the consensus of social scientists without strong data backing them up. The consensus of social scientists fifty years ago was that masturbation will kill you (after driving you into misery

&gt;&gt;In short, and a lot of what he has to say seems to make sense. Dr. Stuart Brody and several allies in European sexology have formed a small clique that focuses on the difference between intercourse and masturbation, and they find a lot to complain about. Here's a short letter by one member of the clique, entitled [""Masturbation is Related to Psychopathology and Prostate Dysfunction""](http://www.reuniting.info/download/pdf/Costa.Masturbation.PDF), published in the respected Archives of Sexual Behaviour last year. Of course, most in sexology dismiss the Brody clique as so many kooks. Both sets of ideas have their own proponents and detractors within NoFap. Some combine the two. Plenty reject both.

&gt;&gt;We tried last year to make a modest contribution to the available knowledge out there by conducting a very detailed survey of NoFap (results [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/updy4/rnofap_survey_data_complete_datasets/)), we all know that grand questions of scientific validity must be left to professionals, in the end. By necessity, we continue to deal in anecdotes. We don't make promises, and our FAQ says in big bold text, ""NoFap is not proven science."" What we do do is invite people who are curious, who are hopeful, and suggest that they try it out. Until science has advanced a little farther than it has today

&gt;##How has your experience been moderating /r/NoFap? What content do you like to see

&gt;&gt; **Camp_Olympia** Moderating has been a great experience. It can be a bit much, which was a real treat when we had 100 or so requests waiting to go. But if all folks needed to improve their lives was a minute of my time to go into a Google calendar, it was worth it. Now, most of our time is spent updating the female flair (a CSS trick that changes a woman's username to pink, if she requests it) and granting Elder Badges (little shields that show up next to users that complete the 90 day challenge and are active within the subreddit). Every once in a while we get some folks from /r/im14andthisisfunny and they post porn, but it's seemed to be less of a problem the larger our community has become.

&gt;&gt;I love the success stories. Reading all these great stories of people who have quit their habit or are realizing that they can succeed at something, I don't really like when image macros or memes get posted. Some are funny, but to me they're lowest common denominator fluff. They can crowd out some of the self posts that other people post, ones that people spend hours crafting and hoping for a response. We usually get a big influx of them each month when a new challenge starts up, but they die down after that.

&gt;&gt;That being said

&gt;&gt; **Alexanderr** Moderating /r/NoFap is time consuming, etc.

&gt;&gt;Although it is debated a bit

&gt;&gt; **FaplessAndFancyFree** Moderating has been easy ever since I stopped doing it! That's something I need to fix; as I'm finding in the new year, remove the porn, ban the trolls. There were problems at one point between religious NoFappers (a minority on our sub) and atheist ones (who are a strong majority), as both saw NoFap as a haven for different reasons... but those have subsided after the mods made it clear that we are not a religious debating society. We are all here to support each other in our goals, whatever they are, whyever we have them. That conflict notwithstanding, the true heart of NoFap moderation isn't curating content; it's serving the community. I'd like to say that maintaining Elder badges, the FAQs, if I can give back to this community that's given me so much

&gt;##Are there any personal stories you have behind not masturbating? How has it affected you?

&gt;&gt; **FaplessAndFancyFree** My reboot story was unspeakably long. I shan't reprint it here. Mine is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/sdpwz/day_215_full_report_tldr_alert/); many more are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/r7xob/nofap_resource_thread_90day_reports/).

&gt;&gt; **Camp_Olympia** I'll share mine. I've been jerkin' it since about 6th grade, and while I made some other stupid personal decisions during that time, it was the first time in my life I didn't worry about my dick, and social situations didn't give me the crippling anxiety I used to feel. I don't know if the not fapping was the cause of it, or it was merely a placebo and part of a ""fake it until you make it"" type situation, but I'd like to think that played a big role.

&gt;&gt; **Alexanderr** I experience increased energy and motivation while participating in NoFap challenges.

Alright.  Like many of you, how that bitch receptionist at my kids school still has a job, pugs, all these things leave me with a sense of W. T. fuck.  And I love it!  I could lose hours of sleep, send my blood pressure through the roof, pull out the rest of my hair and I'd never be happier.  Why?  Why do I love the frustration of not understanding?  I don't know!  Oh it's a vicious, thrilling spiral of confusion and anger.  What about this one; my latest mystery.  Sometimes at night

The great thing about a mystery is that you are totally in charge of the way it all goes down.  It only works if you care and you get to determine the level of commitment. Case in point:  Lost.  Amazing television show, I spent hours trying to solve the puzzle. And when I talked to my friends about it, none of them could understand how anyone could get so worked up over a show.  Worked up indeed!  You were either really into Lost or really not.  The level of commitment depended upon you.

We’ve all had that feeling where we get banned from, or banned from using the internet. Then there’s getting banned from a Club Penguin server. To keep the explanation short, these people don’t give a fuck.


Now I know what you guys are gonna say: “OH KANGAKANGAKANGA WHAT DA FAK CLUB PENGUIN IS A KIDDYS GAME Y R U FETURIN DIS SUBREDDIT?!?!??!?!?” 


Number One: Because this subreddit is interesting and awesome. 


Number Two: It’s not a kids game if you just BELIEVE! 


Number Three: Everyone loves penguins!


The purpose of this subreddit is to make people laugh at everyone getting banned from Club Penguin for using offensive language, but there’s something amusing about swearing/getting banned from a server in a kids game such as Club Penguin. Maybe it’s because of how the pictures are presented. It will almost always look like [this](http://imgur.com/yHv96Nj). You see? It shows the ban message with your penguin saying the message that got you banned in the first place. Pretty good, right?

I know, it’s fairly fun, it kinda makes you feel like a kid. But this subreddit makes our immature humor step out and say some stupid shit like “FUCK I WANT SOME PUFFLES BITCH!” and as a result we get banned, take a screencap of it, then post it to this subreddit. NEAT. 

I got my CP account a little over 5 months ago (because I was bored) and played it for a while

&gt;##1. Why did you create /r/bannedfromclubpenguin?
&gt;&gt; **/u/Xerosus** I created /r/bannedfromclubpenguin because the content that is posted here is a very unique (and often times acquired) taste. What I mean by that is many people do not find this content funny in any regard whatsoever and so in the past pictures of people being banned from Club Penguin would not do well on subreddits such as /r/funny. Because these posts rarely ever did well people such as myself who *do* like that kind of content felt like they needed a place where it could thrive.

&gt;##2. How long have you been playing Club Penguin?
&gt;&gt; **Xerosus** I rarely ever play Club Penguin. This subreddit is not the place to go to if you're looking for hardcore Club Penguin coverage. Most everyone here doesn't play as they spend too much time being banned. 

&gt;##3. Are you suprised at how many subscribers you have?
&gt;&gt; **Xerosus** No

&gt;##4. What's your favourite post on the subreddit so far?
&gt;&gt; **Xerosus** I have to say that my favorite post so far is the one that inspired me [to start this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bannedfromclubpenguin/comments/1965vt/so_lonely_post_that_started_this_sub/). I think that this is one of the most ""deep"" submitions in recent history. (Not to mention it *did* lead to /r/bannedfromclubpenguin 's creation)

&gt;##5. When was the first time you got banned from Club Penguin?
&gt;&gt; **Xerosus** The first time I got banned from Club Penguin was when my group of friends decided to create accounts just for the hell of it. We decided to see how far we could get before being banned. (You'd be surprised)

&gt;##6. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **Xerosus** Thanks for making this subreddit what it is today! Without your support we would be nothing but another ""niche"" subreddit that lives and dies within the span of a week!

I was forced to watch the English dub in my early teens and whilst I thought the story had some great potential, I ended up coming back and watching the subbed version on a summer break and instantly fell in love with the show. I couldn't believe (in my opinion) what a difference the original voice actors made to bringing the show alive.

&gt;&gt;**semizero** My story isn't a very interesting one

&gt;&gt;**evey-schwan** About 5 years ago during a summer vacation in high school my boyfriend forced me to watch all the anime episodes while I was over his house. I don't remember how far we got but we watched One Piece almost every day for an entire summer. Needless to say

&gt; Who is your Favorite Character? Why?
&gt;&gt;**eldatto** I've got a special spot in my heart for Brooke and Franky but I have to say Sanji is my favourite. Why? I think because his character has this cool dichotomy happening. He's not only a great straight up fighter but you'll often see him hanging around in the shadows during arcs

&gt;&gt;**semizero** Zoro will always be my favorite character

&gt;&gt;**evey-schwan** Hard question. I think my favorite would be Usopp

&gt; What character are you most surprised about? What character do you not like anymore? Why?
&gt;&gt;**eldatto** Post time skip I'm a little concerned about some of the female character designs

&gt;&gt;**semizero** I think Usopp is my answer for both questions. He was pretty lackluster when he first joined

&gt;&gt;I still really like him and find him funny and necessary

&gt;&gt;**evey-schwan** I'm surprised about Brooke the most

&gt; At what point did you realize
&gt;&gt;**eldatto** I have a ""SHIT JUST GOT REAL!"" moment every couple of episodes hahaha. Maybe I'm easily excitable.

&gt;&gt;**semizero** Once I caught up in the anime I immediately started reading the manga, I really enjoyed that arc!

&gt;&gt;**evey-schwan** Too many times to count.. :P

&gt; Tell us about your community
&gt;&gt;**eldatto** The r/onepiece community is fantastic, post screenshots of mistakes, help test multiple browsers and even create their own art assets for features I just didn't have time to make. For me that's what makes modding the CSS for r/onepiece so addictive, I want to keep tweaking it and inventing new features because I believe this community truly deserves the best and I know they're going to be there to help me out when I need it.

&gt;&gt;**semizero** The community has always been fantastic. They've helped out even when I was first learning the basics of CSS. They've done more than I have to improve the subreddit. But even more than that

&gt;&gt;**evey-schwan** ur community is special because I always see such awesome discussions and theories and I always appreciate them. That's why we made this subreddit in the first place,False,self,t5_2sgno,1345050570.0,,WRITER,t3_y91yy

Happy Saturday! So I've been getting into minecraft by accident and against my free will. It's not like I need another distraction in life, which I guess makes me a wannabe online game addict ie. quite far from traditional ideas of coolness. The digging sound is just so satisfying. And *peaceful*. Like one of those Japanese animated movies where the wind slowly rustles the trees and the heroine silently resolves to avenge her grandfather. Its not like real life where you try and you struggle and you spend months and years working towards a dream only to realise that your short term aims are moronic, your long term goal doesn't actually exist and the route you planned to take leads only to senility in a dumpster. In the magical, *logical* world of online structure games life makes sense.

Anyway, **a** is an alpaca, and **B** is a giant cave bear (the symbols also have colours and stuff but thats the basic idea). And it's complex! [Mega mega complex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNSMFWd_ydI) (always watch dward fortress videos on HD). For those that don't know, the essential idea is that you build a fortress with dining rooms and defenses and bed chambers and store rooms and farms and stuff, its populated with dwarfs and eventually it gets destroyed by a natural disaster or a marauding army or whatever. There is no winning, the aim is simply to not lose for as long as possible. Unfortunately, the mods of /r/DwarfFortress are.... moderate in their reddit usage

This Monday's featured subreddit is one that literary, [Jon Snow](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmuoh1NDt01qa25vco1_500.jpg)) or even /r/TheHobbit. It's bigger, better, and meatier than any single fan subreddit: it's r/FanTheories!

/r/FanTheories is a subreddit dedicated to theories and speculation about creative works

This subreddit is a boon for any of you who were decent at literary essay writing back in high school and college, I haven't had time to come up with some evidence to support my title's claim, but if any of you lovely readers are willing to spend an evening defending it, then you have my blessing to reap that karma, and [reap it long and hard til you can't reap anymore](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnvpikeeNL1qjww9s.gif). 

Even if the above *doesn't* describe you and you hate essay writing with a fiery passion

Today's interview with /r/FanTheories mods, is courtesy of the great /u/SidTheMagicLobster, who came through for me when 3 potential subreddit feature-es ~~bailed~~ (**Edited for word choice**) declined to be featured  over the past week. Sid is truly a god among lobsters!

&gt;1. What first piqued your interest in fan theories?

&gt;&gt;**doctorsnazzbaggle**: I think the [AskReddit fan theories thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ubaqq/what_fan_theories_have_blown_your_mind_with_their/) created by /u/FrancisDollarHyde was what sparked my interest in fan theories.

&gt;&gt;**N_Sharma**: I've always been interested in tropes and discussion around fiction but dislike fanfics (that is not what the subreddit is about though). Some theories are pretty interesting

&gt;&gt;**numbertheory**: In addition to the AskReddit thread, which is fun to read through when something new is posted. I like that /r/FanTheories doesn't limit the media type too much, just limiting it to fiction.

&gt;2. Have any fan theories ever ruined a tv show/movie for you?

&gt;&gt;**dsb**:The [Totoro is the god of death theory.](http://fellowof.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/an-inconvenient-truth-about-my-neighbor-totoro/)

&gt;&gt;**N_S**: Not yet.

&gt;&gt;**nt**: Not really,"" but never by fans. The closest to ruined for me might be the [Aladdin is set in the future](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/uc247/aladdin_is_set_in_the_future/) theory, just because it tries to take every joke as not a joke.

&gt;3. In your opinion

&gt;&gt;**dsb**:[This Avengers theory](http://maskofreason.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/very-good-writing-why-loki-won-in-the-avengers/) perfectly justifies what I thought was just a weak ending.

&gt;&gt;**N_S**: I like the theory about [Blue's Raticate in Pokemon R/G](http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/Stryker_X7/GarysRattata.jpg) which can be expanded [a bit](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ucusm/you_are_the_antagonist_in_pokemon_redblue/c4uf4zc) in Pokemon G/S.

&gt;&gt;Another interesting theory that I discovered in this subreddit was about [Inception and Ariadne](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/uxugp/inception_ariadnes_the_extractor_hired_by_michael/). I don't really agree with this theory but it still made me speculate about Ariadne.

&gt;&gt;**nt**: [The Ferris Bueller theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/uc2if/ferris_and_sloan_are_a_figment_of_camerons/) is my favorite. It not only gives complexity to Cameron

&gt;4. Any last things you'd like to plug/say?

&gt;&gt;**dsb**: PM me or message the mods if anyone has any advice to help improve /r/FanTheories and I'd like to thank /r/SubredditOfTheDay for featuring us!

&gt;&gt;**N_S**: Nothing more than what doctorsnazzbaggle said.

&gt;&gt;**nt**: I did the banner for /r/FanTheories and /r/plotholes

A rugged man with a hardened face peers out at the landscape below him.

The hills are draped in green and grey. Forgotten homes dot the landscape, a broken rake, a TV satellite dish unseated from its perch. Things not important enough to take with you after you've been ordered to uproot. 

The man felt stiff. His joints had been freezing up on him

They were supposed to come back for him- that's the military does, or a radio weeks ago and he had been alone here ever since.

""How have I survived this long?"" The hardened man tries to whisper to himself

The gods are cruel. They will not let him die, to die a hero's death, but still no enemy storms the city, no hoarde darkens the horizon. He suspects they never will. 

[Instead he peers out at the sleeping landscape and waits for death to come](http://i.imgur.com/IVY4h.jpg).

It's a refreshing sight to see

Don't even get me started on the subs' many [awesome photos](http://i.imgur.com/M73iqKG.jpg) of their troops' [sometimes unintentional placements](http://i.imgur.com/KTO5BUj.png). There's just something heart-warming to me about [seeing a little green man](http://i.imgur.com/QaGJvpah.jpg) stand watch over a ski slope or [aim their little bazookas at passing ships](http://i.imgur.com/dfaV0tn.jpg).

These little army men are more than just toys. They're gallant soldiers fighting on the front lines on this sub's war against *The Enemy*

But enough of this idle sissy talk


&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/GreenDawn?

&gt;&gt;**voraidicon** In GreenDawn there is no why! We fight because we are soldiers and we are soldiers from birth. But really

&gt;2.Who is the enemy?

&gt;&gt;**voraidicon** Obviously the freaking dinosaurs. They are everywhere man. It is hard to talk about the carnage. I have nightmares of blood and teeth. The horror. I have also found subsequent enemies such as janitors

&gt;3.What is the most memorable ops story you've seen on /r/GreenDawn?

&gt;&gt;**voraidicon** I would have to say the [University of Oregon Campaign](http://imgur.com/a/84w0o)

&gt;&gt;The campaign also found our [first reddit recruit](http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenDawn/comments/13wt5r/found_whitehead_squadron_in_library_in_sector_541/) via the GreenDawn insignia we write on the bottom of our soldiers and it has [one awesome troop placement](http://i.imgur.com/kH0K0.jpg) which is still there. Over.

&gt;4.Who is your most highly ranked officer

&gt;&gt;**voraidicon** Admiral Anthroduck and Admiral Kvothe24 are our supreme leaders. Some of us have around 500 troops deployed. It is hard to keep track of too many and of course there are always losses. This is war

&gt;5.Do you have any advice for successful long-term troop placements?

&gt;&gt;**voraidicon** Depends on the target. You would be amazed who lives and who dies. Placing [this troop](http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenDawn/comments/115mpm/obvious_but_impossible_to_defeat/) made my testicles tingle but somehow died a few months later. 

&gt;&gt;Ensign Snorkelandcleats placed [this troop](http://i.imgur.com/oLEcX.jpg) in a very busy grocery store and is still fighting today. 

&gt;&gt;If the building has regular janitors anywhere they won't dust or clean. Ultimately if it can't be reached the troop isn't going anywhere. This is the fun part; finding little spots and placing a troop without being seen while doing so is half the battle. The other half is doubling back to take a picture of your favorite placement then posting to our sub. Over.

&gt;6.Anything you'd like to say to your soldiers?

&gt;&gt;**voraidicon** Keep up the good fight. Going on a mission can really turn things around. First date

Now go out and pick up a [bucket of soldiers](http://www.searchamateur.com/pictures/toy-story-bucket-o-soldiers-1.jpg)

From my bed I dictate responses, and a small gust of wind slips through my open window. My walls, lined with books, have shadows cast on them from various instruments and memorabilia. All is fitting for a man such as myself, except which lay upon the table next to me: A plate of microwaved popcorn chicken.

It's true, and the ever gravyneck, but let's face facts. Eating healthy is difficult. Not only do most of the healthy foods taste like an unusually ugly turd, they're expensive. We can dance around our bacon and narwhal sandwiches all we want, but we're getting fatter.

/r/EatCheapAndHealthy, and one would be correct. I chose a couple dishes off of there when I was deciding whether or not to feature this subreddit, and made them. Indeed, they were tasty as, one would say, a mofo. I needed to pay my compliments, and so I sat down with the moderation team with some questions.

At this time

&gt;#1. ""Cheap"" and ""Healthy"" aren't two words that usually go together. Why do you think healthy food is so hard to obtain?

&gt;&gt;**Fenrir's Child** Healthy and cheap aren't usually used together because a lot of people don't know how cost-effective healthier foods can be. I was right there less than a year ago, dietitian, nor nutritionist) I find I spend the same amount or less and am just as satiated, but am eating significantly healthier.

&gt;&gt;**loveshercoffee** I think healthy food isn't always hard to obtain, sugar and fat than should be consumed if the food were eaten regularly.

&gt;&gt;**hardtoremember** It really isn't that expensive to cook at home, we were saving around $400 a month, simply by bringing our own lunch and coffee. In fact, almost all of the recipes I've posted serve at least four people, with leftovers for lunch for just at or under $10.

&gt;&gt;**DelicateStranger** The dynamic pull between cheap and healthy is such a big discussion

&gt;&gt;**PabstyLoudmouth** ""Cheap"" and ""healthy"" should be words that are associated with each other. We live in a time when good nutritional food is readily available and can be found at a low cost providing you take the time to chose to eat right. It is a change in mindset and looking at food in a much different way.

&gt;#2. You can tell us. What are your eating habits like?

&gt;&gt;**Fenrir's Child** I eat within paleo guidelines for the most part. I know it's not the diet for everyone, fruits, veggies, and the like. I have a handful of recipes up on the sub if you want to check them out!

&gt;&gt;**loveshercoffee** I'm all about everything in moderation with the emphasis being equally on the everything and the moderation. I have no specific diet; I'm not gluen free, vegan, vegetarian, raw-food, paleo or anything else. I also have very few dislikes (raw bananas or jello are about the the only things I won't touch ever.) I cook the majority of the things I eat from scratch and even grow some of my own food. However I also eat a double cheeseburger from McD's when I want one - I just don't want one more than a couple of times a year.

&gt;&gt;**DelicateStranger** Oh man, I've gone on keto for a couple of months, I've gained and lost weight, but currently I'm eating a lot of convenience foods because I have a stressful job and bad long-term habits built up. I'm currently pushing myself to cook a little bit more every week, with a goal of getting a set of recipes down: I never want to come home from work and think ""what am I making for dinner tonight, I have no ideas"" ever again.

&gt;&gt;**hardtoremember** We eat really well at my house. We've gotten so far into the habit of not eating out and making everything home made that we've lost the taste for fast food now. It's also really hard to justify spending 4 or 5 dollars on McDonald's when I have a big container of home made spaghetti in the fridge at work.

&gt;&gt;**PabstyLoudmouth** My eating habits have gone from horrid (fast food everyday, and I feel in love with my veggies and tubers.

&gt;#3. I tried a couple dishes off here

&gt;&gt;**Fenrir's Child** My standby favorite is [pollo asado](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/15ojnt/pollo_asado_or_chicken_tacoburrito_meat/). I use this in a lot of other recipes, I've got a batch with green salsa added going as I type!

&gt;&gt;**hardtoremember** My favorite that I've posted so far is the chicken noodle soup. It takes a while to do the whole thing from scratch

&gt;&gt;**DelicateStranger** Whatever spicy thing people post on Fiery Fridays

&gt;&gt;**PabstyLoudmouth** There are many tasty recipes on here and my favorite so far has been u/hardtoremember's Chicken noodle soup

&gt;#4. Reddit is a great platform for communities

&gt;&gt;**Fenrir's Child** The one that really caught my attention is there isn't a good way to print recipes

&gt;&gt;**loveshercoffee** I love Reddit so much

&gt;&gt;**PabstyLoudmouth** So far I have my biggest problem is how confusing CSS is. I do go to /r/CSShelp but I still feel like an idiot in that department. There is the occasional troll or people that want to argue

&gt;#5. Have you got anything else you wanna say? Say something

&gt;&gt;**Fenrir's Child** Eating healthy on a tight budget seems scary, especially seeing how much less I was buying compared to before. I was pleasantly surprised! Since September, I am happier, healthier, and have lost 48lbs, on a $300-400/mo budget for two people, a cat, homemade diets to manage illness. If we can do it (and we splurge, we're all friendly and are here to help people make their lives a little healthier one meal at a time.

&gt;&gt;**loveshercoffee** I think accepting a variety of foods and being willing to put a little effort into preparing them is the key to eating healthy and doing it without a lot of money. Buying ingredients and cooking for yourself is a huge start and it only grows bigger and better from there!

&gt;&gt;**hardtoremember** Eating right isn't really expensive and it isn't really difficult, you just won't want it anymore.

&gt;&gt;**DelicateStranger** This is completely off the topic of food, and don't be shy about reaching out to others.

&gt;&gt;**PabstyLoudmouth** I would like to see people look at food much

Our questions were once all that drove us apart from the animal kingdom, they've been answered. Finally we know how not to get fat. Truly a red letter day.

a community for **5 months** with **114


It was five months ago when the moderators of /r/cringe made the controversial decision to remove all image posts in /r/cringe, /r/CringePics has quickly grown to be one of the largest and most entertaining subreddits of all time. /r/Cringepics is also one of my personal favorites. I probably have more posts saved from this sub than any other. Some of the ones that I love the most are [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/15nab4/uk_doll_lovers_meet/), [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/15l1vg/let_me_explain_to_you_what_it_means_to_be_alpha/), and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/14ywbb/guy_posing_with_a_can_of_rockstar_for_a_selfie/). I actually spent about five minutes trying to limit myself to just three posts from this wonderful place, because I have so freaking many.     
       
Although the definition of *cringe* means a whole lot to a lot of different people, but we've all been in a similar scenario as some of the images in /r/CringePics. We've Myspace/Facebook/AIM messaged someone we crushed on a little too aggressively and totally made a fool of ourselves. We've been through dramatic fashion and lifestyle changes that we look back upon and cringe with embarrassment (I used to be a little too emo for my taste). There is a photo of you somewhere that is so cheesy you would die if it were to be seen by a group of your peers. This sub works because we can relate in some way.

Give it up for /u/drumcowski and the rest of the superb moderators of /r/CringePics! :D
      



&gt;##1. What inspired you to create /r/cringepics?   
     
&gt;&gt;**drumcowski**: When /r/cringe was started, people started submitting more and more images - which didn't sit well with me because I didn't feel like any of those images were as good as our videos, yet they were overshadowing them and getting ten-times the upvotes.   
     

&gt;&gt;I asked the community if they would welcome banning images - which was met by a pretty harsh ""No."" and ""Fuck you Hitler mod"". From that response, any post that was submitted to /r/cringepics would get downvoted off the front page, leaving the subreddit visibly empty to any new visitors. People were saying that /r/cringepics had no chance of taking off - and they tried to make sure that became a reality, which didn't bother me since I never cared if it was successful or not as long as images would no longer fill up /r/cringe.     
    

&gt;&gt;Eventually the dust settled (though there were multiple posts a day on /r/cringe demanding the ban on images be lifted) - and after a week or so /r/cringepics started to build up a few pages of content. Today - /r/cringepics has grown from 0 subscribers to almost 80, and it's no surprise that a subreddit born into drama would be one of the most linked-to subreddits in /r/subredditdrama.
    

&gt;##2.  What is /r/cringepics? What should people expect to find in your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**drumcowski**: /r/cringepics is a subreddit dedicated to cringe-inducing images
   
&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme**: In theory


&gt;&gt;**IAmAN00bie**: Cringepics is exactly what it sounds like. Users submit pictures depicting situations that are ""cringe-worthy"". Cringe is the feeling of embarrassment you get from seeing/watching another person's embarrassing moments. /r/cringe is for videos of cringe-worthy moments whereas /r/cringepics is for the pictures. Both subs serve the same purpose
When you browse /r/cringepics

&gt;&gt;**iaacp**: /r/cringepics was made in the wake of a large amount of low quality imgur posts being the majority of what made up the frontpage of /r/cringe. In /r/cringepics

&gt;##3. What's your favorite submission on /r/cringepics?
 


&gt;&gt;**drumcowski**: [This one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/18mjp0/new_rule_please_read/)


&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme**: I'm a real sucker for over-enthusiastic MLP fans. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/16ag4x/come_face_to_face_with_a_ponyfucker_blacked_out/) submission is a primo cringe goldmine. I read all of it... even the extra content the OP linked where the guy writes a novel about his passionate love for Twilight Sparkle.
I think it's tied with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/133kvp/babyfurs_comfort_one_another/) submission though. That was in the very first week the sub was opened

&gt;&gt; **IAmAN00bie**: I have two pics that I want to show that perfectly represent what /r/cringepics should be. [The first one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1749fp/marykate_olsen_with_her_42_year_old_french/) shows a moment that makes you feel physically uncomfortable. She just looks so awkward sitting there while being kissed, yeah, but anybody in that situation who found out that they fucked up like that would be thinking ""oh god what did I do...."" I feel embarrassed for him, even though this has nothing to do with me personally.

&gt;&gt; **kreius**: http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/16wmrx/friend_calls_a_guy_out_for_faking_relationship/

&gt;&gt; **iaacp**: I have a terrible memory that couldn't possibly remember my favorite

&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz**: [This is just... depressing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/17khmw/what_an_awesome_girlfriend_oh_wait/)


&gt;##4. Is it hard to run a subreddit that is based off of a reaction/feeling? It would seem like all the time you would get ""this isn't cringe-y enough!
    

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski**: At first it seems a bit overwhelming to have to make decisions on subjective content


&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem**: Not really

&gt;&gt; **IAmAN00bie**: Sort of. Cringe is a difficult concept that's missed by a lot of submissions, so even if a submission front-pages the commenters might tear the submission apart. I rely on the reaction of the commenters to gauge if a submission should stay (and only if it's clearly one-sided, if there's any split in their opinions then it usually stays).

&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme**: It's actually not too common for the top comment on a submission to be ""this isn't cringe-worthy."" It certainly is subjective though

&gt;&gt;**kreius**: That's a huge part of it

&gt;##5. Best part about being a moderator of this subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**drumcowski**: Being able to make decisions that may appear to be detrimental to the subreddit, but because we believed that sort of content could potentially do more harm to the person than it would benefit our subreddit. 

&gt;&gt; **kreius**: Helping the community

&gt;&gt; **iaacp**: Banning jerks


&gt;&gt;**Addyct**: replying 'k' to every modmail. It's basically my only job.


&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz**: Chatting with the other moderators. They're really swell guys despite the fact that we're anonymous from one another.

&gt;&gt; **stopscopiesme**: It's nice being able to have a hand in shaping and directing one of my favorite subreddits.


&gt;&gt; **IAmAN00bie**: I get to filter through the best and the worse posts. I get to stop bullying in its tracks. Cringe, so doing whatever I can to minimize it is something I love.


&gt;&gt; **ManWithoutModem**: Getting people that post dox shadowbanned from reddit.


&gt;##6. Any rules that you would like new subscribers to be aware of?


&gt;&gt;**drumkowski**: All of them - read the sidebar in it's entirety



&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

    
    
&gt;&gt;**drumcowski**: A lot of people don't like this subreddit, report it or send us a modmail with a link to it. This place still needs a lot more work, and we can accomplish far more with everyone's help.

&gt;&gt; **kreius**: Stop posting shit with kids in it, it's probably going to get removed.


&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz**: To everyone that has abided by the rules... thanks for making this subreddit an awesome place. There's been moments when I've cringed so hard that my balls curdle up like a cowering turtle.


&gt;&gt; **stopscopiesme**: Cringing should have an element of compassion. It can be a lot of fun to be catty about the people you see on here, but it's enough that r/CringePics can and does have a serious negative impact. So don't be an asshole. And if you see someone else being an asshole (especially if you see someone linking a personal profile or trying to use r/CringePics as their personal army) report and/or modmail.


&gt;&gt; **IAmAN00bie**: Please remember what the definition of cringe is. You'll probably see a lot of submissions that remind you of embarrassing moments you had in your life. Don't hate yourself or the person for doing what you did


&gt;&gt; **ManWithoutModem**: Also

[**Hockey.**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey) The word strikes fear into the hearts of [camera manufacturers](http://i.imgur.com/x76VY.gif) the world over. A frozen 3"" diameter vulcanized rubber puck is dropped onto a fresh sheet of ice,](http://i.imgur.com/o1MC1.gif) the [hits,](http://i.imgur.com/EWV0J.gif) the [shots,](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1081001/dive.gif) the [saves,](http://i.cubeupload.com/qj7FRc.gif) the [goals,](http://i.imgur.com/7ZJVI.gif) and [the celebrations](http://i.imgur.com/NBLja.gif) really have to be [seen first hand](http://i.imgur.com/Q3Q1x.gif) in order to be believed. 

**/r/hockey, where more than [45,000 faithful](http://www.bookcaseangel.com/images/hockey-animated-gif.gif) gather to tell each other exactly what they think of the play that the [team goon made against the superstar last night.](http://myimg.us/images/03.21.12/24958.gif) No topic is out of bounds; Alex Ovechkin's hijinks, Paul Bissonette's endless tweets, Don Cherry's suits, and [Roberto Luongo's](http://pictir.com/pic/rT7ts.gif) future digs are all up for debate. An almost universal hatred of league [Commissioner Gary Bettman](http://i.imgur.com/JMxIM.jpg) sits like a thick fog on the community. His decision this week to lock out the players pending CBA negotiations has many people anxious about whether there will be a NHL season this year.


**Growing** up in Canada I know that [our passion for the sport is intense](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/2252651_o.gif). Hockey is something that unites all Canadians

I know [Americans love their hockey as well](http://i.imgur.com/bZS6B.jpg) but they cover up their love for the game with an air of disinterest, ""when was the last time a Canadian Team won the Stanley cup again?""

**So** I dragged SaltyChristian over to my igloo, eh? (SaltyChristian wrote that part) (Shhhh don't tell them) We were not surprised that to find that they all [loved Ron Hextall.](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs4/2237962_o.gif)


&gt;##1. What is your hockey related background? 

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** Unfortunately my only hockey related history is as a fan, I started to differentiate players, realized Mario Lemieux was better than everyone, and became a Penguins fan. Eventually, I realized I should probably pay attention to my home team, which is how I discovered Pavel Bure and became a Canucks fan. Still waiting on that Cup.

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** I've been a fan of hockey (and specifically the Chicago Blackhawks) since I was a toddler. Since I went to University of Illinois for college

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** I've played goalie since high school, but ""fandom"" really clicked when streaming radio and online TV streams let me follow the Leafs while out of their network.

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** I started skating very young

&gt;&gt;I was the captain of my select team in my age group from 8-11. Still playing Swansea and George Bell house leagues

&gt;&gt;I joined the Toronto Marlboros when I was 12

&gt;&gt;I've played with future NHLers, and always had fun doing it all.

&gt;&gt;I channeled my competitiveness into professional video gaming after leaving hockey, and now I've got a young nephew who's just starting to play (at Swansea and George Bell, funny enough,) and I'm looking forward to doing it all over from the stands.

&gt;&gt;As a fan, Doug Gilmour, and Felix Potvin, and wonder if I'll ever see another Leafs team with players who I feel deserve to wear the jersey like those guys did.

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** None

&gt;##2. Please describe /r/hockey.

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** /r/hockey is a place where people can discuss hockey on a higher level without trolling, reposts, racism, bigotry or any of the other stuff that makes online communities fall apart and die. We mods are vigilant in maintaining the high quality of submissions and encourage thought provoking discourse.

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** Well, equipment, etc.

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** r/hockey is a place for the sport of hockey. The subreddit covers every league, errant and inaccurate trade speculation, and the typical, unoriginal, and often offensive flaming.

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** /r/hockey is a place where the best of two worlds meet. We try to combine everything that's great about hockey forums and blogs, to keep out the bad shit that's ruining some parts of reddit, and has been ruining places like hfboards for years.

&gt;&gt;So far it seems like we've found a formula that works, stay active, and don't get complacent, which would let this place fall from the lofty heights we've set for it.

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** A community passionate about hockey. There are many strong opinions here

&gt;##3.  What is your favorite league? Your favorite Team? Since it's obviously the Canucks feel free to skip this question.

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** NHL/Canucks

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:**Favorite league would be the NHL, and as I mentioned above I enjoyed college hockey too!

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** NHL

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** NHL

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** NHL - Boston Bruins

&gt;##4.  What will you do this season if the lockout at the NHL level drags on?

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** Good question. I just came to this decision yesterday. I'm noticing an emerging hockey nation in Denmark and, so I'm going to follow whatever team Hansen plays for, while also familiarizing myself with the country's hockey infrastructure, culture and history.

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** I'll probably cry myself to sleep. I have season tickets to the Blackhawks and now that I'm about to be ""funemployed""

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** Weep, then look for KHL streams and do my own play-by-play, substituting Leafs for KHLers.

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** I'll be channeling all that hockey passion into my nephew's game

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** Focus on the NFL and minor hockey leagues.

&gt;##5.  Friday Trash Talk is hilarious and a huge hit. Who is responsible for that idea and what do the mods think of it.

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** I'm a big fan of the trash talk threads. I liken them to the hockey fight. There's a lot of tension in r/hockey, much like fights, are a good way to get it all out without resorting to cheap shots.

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** I'm pretty sure the Friday Trash Talk threads were the idea of the community

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** Not sure who started the thread

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** Friday trash talk is hilarious. While I don't participate, and so we let it do what it was going to do. It's worked out well.

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** I think our users brought it to our subreddit

&gt;##6. If you had a choice between going back in time and killing Bettman or owning the New York Rangers

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** I'd go back in time to 1994

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** Probably a laser gun of some sort. Either way.

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** Something slow and painful. Like lockout negotiations.

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** I would own the New York Rangers. I would take Gary Roberts back in time with me. During a time when an NHLer's off-season consisted of drinking beer at the cottage

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** Liam Neeson from Taken.

&gt;##7.  Pick one Ron and say why: Hextall

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** Hextall. [This is why.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8_wrJpRDaU) One of the tragedies of modern hockey is that the greatest on ice personality in the history of the game could not exist within modern rules.

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** Hextall. He took no crap from anybody.

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** Hextall. As a goalie

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** Hextall

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** Hextall

&gt;##8.  What plans do you have for the subreddit? Anything coming down the pipe?

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** We like to keep these things a surprise.

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** I'm with kmad - we'll keep our plans a surprise.

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** Not sure

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** Personally I'm working on the next batch of team logo flair. New KHL and NCAA teams, etc. I don't have tons of time lately, but I'm getting through it.

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** I prefer to take a more hands-off approach, which doesn't really happen often.

&gt;##9.  What is the main rival to the NHL in North America and why does /r/NBA suck?

&gt;&gt;**kmad:** The main rival to the NHL in North America is the lockout. Hockey fans tend to not get wrapped up in cross-sport rivalries. We're happy with our game the way it is (maybe with a few minor changes) and don't really care what sports other people watch. We're pretty confident in knowing hockey's the best and that's good enough for us.

&gt;&gt;**honestbleeps:** I'm not sure the NHL really has a rival. Hockey is unlike any other sport

&gt;&gt;I couldn't tell you what's wrong with /r/NBA because I don't really read it but I guess I'm supposed to hate the people who share a building with my favorite hockey teams so um .. you stink

&gt;&gt;**commentastic:** Gary Bettman is the main rival to the NHL. /r/NBA sucks because they've got some sort of injury that's unrelated to being checked into the boards.

&gt;&gt;**Majupra:** The NHL's main rival is failing markets. There's always impassioned arguments from fans of those teams about the loyal fans, and I understand where they're coming from. I really do. The fact remains that their teams aren't sustainable, though.

&gt;&gt; In my dream NHL, and revenue sharing percentages would be increased ten-fold. The % that the NHL shares is squat compared to the other major sports, and it needs to increase by a large market to keep franchises healthy, but in return the franchises that will never be successful need to be folded.

&gt;&gt;/r/NBA sucks because any sport where 90% of the talent is concentrated on 10% of the teams sucks. Also

&gt;&gt;**Indus7168:** The main rival is probably the NBA as far as season timing goes

So I dropped out of college. Whatever. You can make something of yourself without a degree right?

I don't know. The real world kinda sucks out there. Job hunting, bills and leaser agreements. Fun stuff, let me tell you.

I am, and a process. Yeah.... that's what i'll call it... a process. 

I am looking at living in a slightly ghetto, but most importantly it would be mine. 

Whenever I wanted to

Whenever I wanted to

Whenever I wanted to I could get away from work, chop down some trees ;) and listen to my neighbors fight. Sounds like a dream to me. 

And the best part of it all would be that I won't have to deal with a/some roommate(s).

I try and deal with as few people's bullshit as I have to. And the last few sets of room mates I had heaved an unhealthy level of bullshit into my life on a pretty regular basis. 

One of my roomies in college, gender studies major, and all around ego-driven, stole my money and used it to buy drugs, then took said drugs and slept with the girl I was talking to. Ass-clown. 

But i'm not bitter or anything. 

Anyway, I will also miss out on the shenanigans they bring to the table. Like taking pictures of me sleeping and putting it on the internet for strangers to see.

/r/picturesofiansleeping is a community of just that. Pictures of this guy named Ian.....sleeping. 

I sat down with /u/whynotbeme2, and It is located in the sidebar of /r/picturesofiansleeping, so for further investigation, I would highly suggest a comments browse of that post, though, a lot of content has been removed.

THE INTERVIEW

&gt;1.) RXR: What inspired the creation/conception of /r/picturesofiansleeping?
&gt;&gt; WNBM2: Well, and he tends to sleep like, kinda a lot. Almost 8 hours on some nights. So I figured that there was probably something deep and poetic about that. Unfortunately, I'm kinda lazy and shallow, So I decided to crowdsource my philosophical musings, and post photos of his slumber to the internet. He thought it was funny, so he agreed to it and was one of the first subscribers.

&gt;2.) RXR: I heard there was some drama regarding your subreddit and it's content? Care to elaborate for the record?
&gt;&gt; WNBM2: Oh, and he has a sweet freshman girlfriend within like 2 seconds. I tell his girlfriend about it, she thinks its funny, subscribes, and allows me to post ""+"" pictures. They're sweet and cute and everyone loves them. Well, almost everyone. Then +'s mom finds the subreddit, and she flips out, and calling me a child pornographer.
The admins remove the links, and also an internet thing; she said she didn't understand. I told her I got the offending images taken off the host site (imgur), that I would no longer post pictures of her daughter because she didn't want me to, though I did nothing wrong and was fully justified in all of my actions. She then went on to explain that since technically there were pictures of a minor in technically sexual situations, I was technically a child pornographer. technically.
Later she cooled off and sent me some beers and said thinking back

&gt; 3.) RXR: A bird told me you were planning on ending the project known as /r/picturesofiansleeping....is this true? Explain?
&gt;&gt; I don't want picturesofiansleeping to end

&gt; 4.) RXR: Given the chance
&gt;&gt; WNBM2: Of course! And by of course, I don't think I could be happy in perfect safety.

Thanks to those who continue to read and for those who don't continue to read. I could care less!

#### Happy 25th Anniversary Zelda!

---


The name Zelda is ubiquitous among game snobs and casual video game players alike. The green tunic

After 25 beautiful years of epic adventure

Who can forget the frustration and sense of accomplishment the Water Temple gave us in Ocarina of Time? Or the perfection that is A Link to the Past! It is these aspects to the game series that have created a loyal fan base made up of a diverse cross-section 

There is , wisdom and courage. r/Zelda is a place to come and and participate in high discussion, timeline speculation, meme generation, blog/articles saturation and much much more! 


Woozlewuzzle

---

&gt;What can reddit users expect to find in r/Zelda?
&gt;&gt;Well, you would find a lot of fan creations, chats about your favorite games, hidden gems and of course everyone's favorite timeline discussions. Since the game was released, we have nearly doubled in size and we have everything I mentioned plus a lot more meme generations and a lot more discussions about SS.
Also

&gt;Give your honest opinion of the newest Zelda iteration: Skyward Sword!
&gt;&gt;I am still working my way through it, but far too often the motion controls pull me out of the experience.

&gt;If you could only play one Zelda game for the rest of your life
&gt;&gt;That is a pretty tough question to answer as there have been so many great ones. So


&gt; Where do you see the r/Zelda community one year from now?
&gt;&gt;Well there won't be any new releases

&gt;Anything you want to tell the r/Zelda subscribers?
&gt;&gt;Keep being awesome and keep the discussion high! What I love most is discussing the game and reading what others think about it and their wild ideas. Spread the heart containers around and may your bottles always be filled.

Thank as always readers.

Good vibes

####Warning the following subreddit is Not Safe for Work.

It's time once again to skinny dip into the deep end of reddit. /r/MorbidReality is your one stop shop for all things... gone awry. If /r/wtf just doesn't satisfy your hunger for the decrepit or foul

At first I stumbled in r/MR and I thought

And I think we all need that once in a while. A little tab of reality check. For me especially right after Hurricane Sandy hit. This [*final letter*](http://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/12lidp/a_hurricane_sandy_victims_last_message_to_the/) had me on the edge of tears before I read the comments. Remember [as the great tater salad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ClQuI8ds_dg#t=242s) once said, stay safe out there. And whats the deal with gas? It feels like [Iranian oil crisis of '79](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_energy_crisis) all over again. *Sheesh!*

~~Interview with mods will hopefully be up when I wake up.~~

&gt;# 1 How did you end up here? 

&gt;&gt;**ifightfirewithwater** I ended up here actually by acquiring a friendship and close understanding of what this subreddit was made to be by lilstumpz. I grasped the concept he was going for back before we even had 1k subscribers which seems crazy now. I did my best to explain to people what this subreddit was about when they were out of line

&gt;&gt;**** 

&gt;#2 What makes you come back every day to /r/MorbidReality in and out?

&gt;&gt;**ifightfirewithwater** orbidreality plays a big role in my day to day life. I'll be honest

&gt;&gt;**** 

&gt;#3 We all have stories... whats yours?

&gt;&gt;**ifightfirewithwater**  I am a paramedic. I could go on forever. I think the most fucked up thing i've encountered is the 6 month old who was raped to death by her uncle, had a six month old at the time.

&gt;&gt;**** 

&gt;#4 Whats your *favorite* post so far?

&gt;&gt;**ifightfirewithwater** That's a tough one. Everyone's different but my favorites probably have to do with anything surrounding serial killers. That stuff fascinates me.

&gt;&gt;**** 

&gt;#5 Tell us about the community!

&gt;&gt;**ifightfirewithwater**  Basically we are here to observe, because all it takes is one event or one sick person to flip your world upside down. Hug your kids longer, kiss your wife that extra time. say ""i love you"" more. Above anything, Never leave anyone you love on a bad note. Don't go to work angry at that person without telling them what they mean to you. You never know if that is going to be the last moment you see that person.

&gt;&gt;Again

HEAR YE

/r/KarmaCourt is sub where Redditors put their peers on trial for crimes ranging from misdemeanor Douchebaggery for acting like a tool on Reddit to felony Repost.png for karma whoring with a repost and succeeding. A gavel hangs in the sub's top left corner

The full list of crimes and sentences is outlined in [Karma Court's Constitution](http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/ro.Nxo9wz9P0$gW3KM94F/latest), you can even go to [Karma Court Law School!](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtAttorneys/wiki/lawschool)

This sub has grown by about 4k subscribers since last month, several new all-time top cases have been brought to the court:

* [**The People v. /u/Qwerty9989**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/188kbm/the_people_of_reddit_vs_uqwerty9989_for_one/) - Charged with felony Grandtheft.jpg and Douchebaggery for requesting a photoshop

* [**The People v. /u/TuckerJames97**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/16vpht/the_people_of_reddit_vs_utuckerjames97/) - Charged with lying for Karma when he claimed in one post to be a student and in another claimed to be a teacher

* [**The People v. /u/anutensil**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17dkc7/people_of_reddit_user_uanutensil_for_being_a/) - Accused of manipulating /r/politics

/r/KarmaCourt tends to conduct itself fairly professionally, but for the most part things run pretty smoothly thanks to the users' dedication to the KC Constitution and the mods' [efforts to keep the courts in order](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15v664/rkarmacourt_v_rkarmacourt/). 
 
Here to explain more about the court


&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/KarmaCourt?

&gt;&gt;**KoreanTerran**    I was actually there for the first ever case where /u/NotaMethAddict made a post accusing /u/Party_Frog of stealing /u/TheAtomicPlayboy's comment. It was pretty much a joke and was a joke for a couple months until the subscription count started blowing up.

&gt;&gt;**Conquerer** Basically what Korean said

&gt;2.How did you all draft the [Karma Court Constitution](http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/ro.Nxo9wz9P0$gW3KM94F/latest) and why is /u/PolishedSteel stricken from the list of committee members?

&gt;&gt;**KoreanTerran**  One of the users

&gt;&gt;**Conquerer** The Constitution was a separate thing that we didn't put that much of our own input into

&gt;3.Are any of you lawyers/judges in real life?

&gt;&gt;**KoreanTerran** I can't speak for the rest of us

&gt;&gt;**Conquerer** I am no lawyer/judge IRL

&gt;4.Let's say that I want to accuse /u/NoahsArcRises of Felony Douchebaggery ([for background](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1510qe/a_cheaters_tale_part_5_a_summary_of/)); please briefly describe the process of bringing a case to trial (Do I need someone from /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys? What about evidence gathering? Is there a Grand Jury? etc).

&gt;&gt;**KoreanTerran** You would literally just need to make a post.

&gt;&gt;**Conquerer** If you want to accuse someone, but it is by no means a requirement.

&gt;5.If convicted

&gt;&gt;**KoreanTerran**Literally nothing. I think the reason that this subreddit attracts people is because there's a minority of people who enjoy talking and ranting about redditquette. They like having a place to bitch about people reposting images

&gt;&gt;I think that's why any of the meta-subs are popular really. Because in most cases

&gt;&gt;**Conquerer** No punishment at all, but we don't do anything official like that.

&gt;6.What are some of your most memorable cases so far?

&gt;&gt;**KoreanTerran**  One time /u/NotaMethAddict got convicted for reposting and that was pretty huge. He actually ended up resigning as a mod to calm the storm of the hivemind.

&gt;&gt;**Conquerer** /u/big_swinging_dicks made a showcase post, Myself, and MrFace), so we were just messing around with how to run the sub. A lot of them were just straight up guilty verdicts almost before the case even started, so I really enjoyed when we started getting cases in which the community decided the defendant was innocent. (activate Bane voice) So, we gave the power to them, the people.

&gt;7.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**KoreanTerran** Mmmm

&gt;&gt;**Conquerer** To the subs, in which case I'll ban you.""

Ever since I was a little girl

/r/bitchimabus embodies this one rule – a bus can do whatever it wants.  Chances are

/r/bitchimabus is so awesome it was featured on the [Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com/society/bitch-bus-reddit-bamka/).

I decided to sit down with the moderators of /r/bitchimabus to see what makes their subreddit so much fun.

&gt;#1. What made you join the mod team of this amazing subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**bamka** I was added by the creator of the subreddit, but I don't do much moderating outside of the occasional checking out of a flag or something.

&gt;&gt;**amaturegynecologist** Just messaged them and asked.

&gt;#2. What do you expect from your community?

&gt;&gt;**bamka** To keep churning out funny original content and keeping the whole “Bitch

&gt;&gt;**amaturegynecologist** Only expect the best buses out there.

&gt;#3. Do you have any favorite submissions?

&gt;&gt;**bamka** Like I said in the DD interview


&gt;&gt;**amaturegynecologist** I enjoy the GIFS.

&gt;#4. Who do you think would win

&gt;&gt;**bamka** [Clearly](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxaf8r2XM91r8y0fvo1_500.jpg) a bus.

&gt;&gt;**amaturegynecologist** Bus.

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**bamka** Explosions.

Those and the ones that get nominated via our superb [**messaging system.**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23subredditoftheday&amp;subject=Subreddit%20Nomination) So you know what to do.

As the head of /r/SROTD I'm getting pretty tired of doing this

##Hopefully

&gt;1 Why was /r/Offensive_Wallpapers necessary? How'd you end up here?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Natv** I made [**this post**](http://www.reddit.com/s/http://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/sknqs/quotes_on_a_photo_its_beautiful/) months ago. A lot of the comments were calling for a sub for these kind of wallpapers to be made. I figured if it was going to be made

&gt;&gt;**/u/Madiau** I was in that first thread with Natv

&gt;&gt;**/u/mike6452** How did I get here? Well I met natv at a party. He seemed like a pretty cool guy so we started talking for a bit. He kept giving me drinks so I stuck around and got pretty tipsy at that point. One thing led to another and we ended up in a room on a bed. He then said he had to show me something. At this point I was way to drunk to remember how or why it happened

&gt;&gt;**/u/wtfisdisreal** These faggots needed another mod and I post a lot of wallpapers so they invited me to join the team.

&gt;&gt;**/u/drumcowski** I had seen these on 4chan

&gt;2 Whats your favorite offensive Wallpapers so far?
 
&gt;&gt;**Natv** This is the [**one to pop into my head first.**](http://www.reddit.com/http://i.imgur.com/Ni8a1.jpg) The picture is great

&gt;&gt;**Madiau** http://i.imgur.com/TWwDy.jpg I swear

&gt;&gt;**mike6452** http://i.imgur.com/H8xCR.jpg &lt;-- probs my favorite. said it to a few people at the bars actually =P

&gt;&gt;**wtfisdisreal** I may be biased because I made it

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski** Some of my favorite wallpapers so far (that I could find): [1](http://i.imgur.com/I3adg.jpg), [4](http://i.imgur.com/ZinPx.jpg), [5](http://i.imgur.com/Mmfoc.jpg)

&gt;3 What are some other things you hate / do not like? Why?

&gt;&gt;**Natv** I hate how a lot of people can't read the rules. It's right there on the side, or is to damn small, someone will always let us know. Our bad posters are bad, and our good posters are great.

&gt;&gt;**Madiau** I love how offensive people get for so reason

&gt;&gt;**mike6452** I hate people that complain that the content isnt good or that some posts are too offensive. The reason you post here is cause shit will be offensive

&gt;&gt;**wtfisdisreal** I hate how some people think making a subtle wallpaper means that the text has to be size 2.5 font. It's very possible to make a good subtle message without making it illegible.

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski** I hate submissions made in paint. Sorry. My opinion is, but this isn't fucking ""Where's Waldo?"". I guess some people might like that though.

&gt;4 If you had to pick from one wallpaper which would you pick? 1 Horse like duck fucking your mom or 100 duck size horses fucking your mom? 

&gt;&gt;**Natv** Your [**answer.**](http://i.imgur.com/9KeoXDP.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**Madiau** ---

&gt;&gt;**mike6452** I like natv's choice when he changes it to plural instead of singular

&gt;&gt;**wtfisdisreal** [**Duck sized horses.**](http://i.imgur.com/nCPYFgW.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski** 100 duck size horses.

&gt;5 Tell us about your community?

&gt;&gt;**Natv** There isn't much to tell. The humor in the posts range from immature to offensive. A lot of people won't like it, because our community is great and awful and racist and beautiful.

&gt;&gt;**Madiau** ---

&gt;&gt;**mike6452** About our community? Im pretty sure they like fucking goats.

&gt;&gt;**wtfisdisreal** We are horrible

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski** Great

####Writer's Note

This is actually how these mods talk. No joke. Here is a blurb of english text from 1 mod to another.

**6

One of the things that I love about Reddit is its' variety. It has something for everyone. In today's case about half of everyone. This is one of those subreddits that is just for the ladies

/r/ABraThatFits is special subreddit that is dedicated to helping those that wear them to get the best fit possible. Obvious puns about 'support' group and 'one-size-fits-all' advice aside, sizing guides, blogs, a wiki, and a care guide. Even a 'Bratabase' for getting a better fit by manufacturer.

Full disclosure, friends and lovers who are ladies. Over the years I have heard lots of complaints about bras ( and am grateful that I don't have to wear one ). I recommended it to a friend and she found it very knowledgeable and helpful. I think she has good taste and I trust her; she picked me as a friend after all. There are plenty of subreddits that tackle day to day issues like food, fashion, exercise, and money. These are general issues that we all have interest in. But this one is of particular interest to half our population and I thought they could use a moment in the spotlight. After all, there are lots of boobs on Reddit, shouldn't they be comfortable?

So let's see what the MOD team over at /r/ABraThatFits has to say.



&gt;## 1. How did /r/ABraThatFits get started?

&gt;&gt; **/u/_Kita_** Ages ago, and there were lots of misconceptions being shared. At the same time, over on r/bodyacceptance, our great community there was talking about the same problem. So, I heard what they were asking for and started a subreddit just to help find bras that fit. I promoted it a little within both subs and it took off like wildfire. Now we get most of our new subscribers by ""word of mouth"" (recommendations from users in other subs) and occastionally, from posts like u/mywifesbusty 's being bestof'd.


&gt;## 2. You have plenty of resources listed in the sidebar

&gt;&gt; **/u/_Kita_** I would absolutely use the MyWifesBusty fit guide first.

&gt;&gt; **/u/otterhugs** The best place to get started is definitely the “Terrific fitting guide from MyWifesBusty”. That’s where you find out a rough estimate of what size you should be (as anyone who frequents the sub knows, you really could be wearing a size that is that far off. The Bra Band Project is also a good source for those that measure 30 and under in their bands to get an idea visually of what their size looks like. After that, I would just suggest that a newcomer look around the subreddit at various posts to start getting the gist of what goes on here and how you can best ask questions.


&gt;## 3. What are some of the most commonly held misconceptions about fitting?

&gt;&gt; **/u/_Kita_** The most common misconception is the ""add four"" to the band size (underbust) measurement

&gt;&gt; **/u/otterhugs** The most commonly held misconception about fitting is that you are supposed to add four to your underbust measurement in order to get your band size, so even if you’re wearing a bra where the volume of the cups is correct it will not be doing you any favors. Another is that D or DD cups are huge and As are small. You cannot know that without a band size, as the letter of the cup means nothing without it. A 36A for example has about the same volume as a 34B and a 32C and a 30D and a 28DD. Other misconceptions are that 30 or 32 are the smallest possible band sizes when there are many women who need 28s and 26 bands and even some that need 24s (though 26 or 24 bands currently either need to make do with 28s, special order, or alter their bras, we are trying to raise awareness that manufacturers should make those sizes). Then there’s the thought that somehow anything over a D is freakishly huge when that is not the case whatsoever, there are plenty of normal looking women walking around in G’s and GG’s and even bigger and you would never guess that was their size.


&gt;## 4. Why put up with a bra that doesn't fit well?

&gt;&gt; **/u/_Kita_** Most women aren't used to having a bra that fits - but they have to wear something

&gt;&gt; **/u/otterhugs** The only reason that makes any sense to me is financial. Sometimes it can be very hard to find a bra in your size


&gt;## 5. What are your hopes for your sub in the future?

&gt;&gt; **/u/_Kita_** I hope that we continue to grow, and even thinking about promoting elsewhere. We're looking for someone who could maybe generate and share some artwork so we can promote the sub on the front page. 
I'd say the challenges of running this subreddit are fairly limited, and their back pain has been eliminated or reduced is a fantastic payoff. I'm the founder and a moderator over at r/bodyacceptance, so I have a pretty thick skin when it comes to trolls and their ilk, but we do occasionally have to weed out jerks that think it's okay to sexualize women, or comment on their bodies. We have a really strict moderation policy, and honestly, it's a little funny that they're shocked! that we enforce it.

&gt;&gt; **/u/otterhugs** My hopes for the future of this sub are to improve the sidebar resources. A lot. We’ve got some big things planned and it might take us a while to roll them all out but we’ve already begun working on it. I’m also hoping that it’ll continue to grow at the same pace it has been recently, and I just hope it’ll continue to do so!

So there you have it

Spread the love to the smaller subs!

EDIT: As a favor to u/jillcicle whose comments may get lost later on -

&gt;And actually, but MyWifesBusty who wrote our guide is a man. We're open to who ever is interested in being respectful and learning more about bra fit.

I think you just did!

So there you have it gentlemen. If you could use a more comfortable fit,,False,self,t5_2sgno,1360395344.0,,True

I've never really been into the sexually themed subreddits. I've always thought that porn sites are for porn
    
I've broken my own rule. While prowling around reddit
    
   
/r/TILgonewild is a young subreddit, not too creepy, just the right amount of everything. I'll stop gushing now, but you would be wise to check it out. This subreddit has heart.

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create r/TILgonewild?   
     
&gt;&gt;**dino_rawr**: I started to get really bored with the regular gonewild and the repetitive titles. There's only so many ways you can ask if people would like to see your butt or boobs. The compliments are wonderful, and the people who comment turn ANYTHING into a dirty comment. Takes a little bit of creativity and makes it more enjoyable, for me at least. A lot of people bitch on gonewild about it, so I made a whole subreddit for it so the people who do enjoy it, can post there :)
    

&gt;##2.  What should people expect to find on your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**dino_rawr**: Open minded sexy people who really just want to have fun and share useless information. Everyone is invited and welcome to join.  

   
&gt;##3. Most interesting fact you've learned here?


&gt;&gt;**dino_rawr**: The most interesting fact I've learned from /r/TILgonewild is from syriox13: ""Pareidolia is when random images or sounds are perceived as significant. Seeing clouds in the shapes of dinosaurs
   

&gt;##4. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

&gt;&gt;**dino_rawr**: I hope people can have fun on TILgonewild and not take it so seriously.

/r/IdiotsFightingThings is a subreddit about people taking out their aggression on inanimate objects, those objects exacting their revenge. 

You know what? I can understand them

It's a conspiracy, banged your shin on a coffee table, or hit your head on an object hanging too low? Baseballs, footballs, and basketballs used to change course when flying through the air just so they could collide with the side of my head. Phones get lost, cars don't start, and my printer is a real fucking douchebag. Phones get lost, so they decide not to work. The printer is different - it just happens to be a doucher. 

I won't stand it any longer. It's time to rise up and show these objects who's boss. We created them

&gt;##1) Is there anything you would like to say to potential new subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**TheExtremistModerate:** Always make sure you look both ways before crossing a street.

&gt;&gt;**TBoneTheOriginal:** We've all been an idiot at some point in our lives... but we usually don't laugh at ourselves. IdiotsFightingThings allows us to laugh at the idiot in all of us. You won't be disappointed here!

&gt;&gt;**Damadawf:** The premise of our subreddit is simple. There are countless numbers of instances recorded where a person somehow ends up in an altercation with an inanimate object. The outcome of these situations usually ends in hilarity. /r/IdiotsFightingThings is a place where redditors can come to view this hilarity. 

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** If you want to see idiots fight inanimate objects or get hurt by them then you'll really enjoy this subreddit. 

&gt;##2) What was your inspiration for creating or becoming a moderator for /r/IdiotsFightingThings

&gt;&gt;**TheExtremistModerate:** /u/ShibbityBopBopBaDoo posted a comment in a comment thread wondering if there was a subreddit for people ""fighting"" things and getting hurt. I hadn't heard of any sort of subreddit like that, I didn't expect much. Maybe a few might subscribe, but I never expected the number of people who did.

&gt;&gt;**TBoneTheOriginal:** I was there very soon after TheExtremistModerate created the sub upon ShibbityBopBopBaDoo's suggestion and asked to be the first additional mod. The thought of moderating such a great subreddit got me pretty excited

&gt;&gt;**Damadawf:** Basically

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** The concept, and the similarity that it had with the way my own subreddit /r/AnimalsBeingJerks got its popularity; is what inspired me to become a moderator.

&gt;##3) What do people have against inanimate objects?

&gt;&gt;**TheExtremistModerate:** Just look at them! Sitting there all unmoving

&gt;&gt;**TBoneTheOriginal:** I guess people love to take their frustration out on things. Of course

&gt;&gt;**Damadawf:** I guess people are inherently prone to conflict. If we aren't able to fight among ourselves then the nearest object usually ends up copping the abuse. 

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** People sometimes get frustrated and angry with what goes on in their life and want to find a way to get rid of that frustration by fighting inanimate objects or they're just idiots.

&gt;##4) Have you ever found yourself face-to-face with a trashcan giving you a dirty look? What did you do?

&gt;&gt;**TheExtremistModerate:** So there I was, outta nowhere, insulted my mother! I turned around, and what do I see? One of those hoity-toity garbage cans with wheels *and a lid*. I thought to myself ""There's no way I'm going to let this rich asshole talk to me like that,"" so I threw it into oncoming traffic. The people in that 15-car pileup didn't like me but, by god, they *respected* me.

&gt;&gt;**TBoneTheOriginal:** I don't pay attention to white trash. I have better things to fight, right to the kisser.

 &gt;&gt;**Damadawf:** It's amazing how a bit of alcohol can lead you to convince yourself that an otherwise seemingly harmless object should be taken on and destroyed. That last time this happened to me was when I noticed that there was a large amount of frost built up in the freezer. Instead of defrosting the freezer like a normal person would

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** I have never done anything like that in my life. I'm not a person that would get angry easily and fight a inanimate object. That's just not what I do.

&gt;##5) What is your favorite post on the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**TheExtremistModerate:** [This one](http://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsFightingThings/comments/1h6fv6/fuck_your_trash/). Everything just comes together so perfectly. It's the ultimate manifestation of ""what goes around comes around.""

&gt;&gt;**TBoneTheOriginal:** Definitely [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsFightingThings/comments/1h6fa0/im_ok/). The idiot just keeps insisting he is okay until he just drops to the floor. This is 100% just bringing it on himself

&gt;&gt;**Damadawf:** [Definitely this one.](http://i.imgur.com/0Drjf.jpg) I love how after he finally catches it

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** My favorite post is this [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsFightingThings/comments/1h6eji/1_xpost_from_rfunny/?sort=confidence). It's the one that started it all. If that GIF didn't  even exist and was not posted in /r/funny

&gt;##6) What do you enjoy most about moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**TheExtremistModerate:** Going through the new submissions and watching them to tag them. It's a real pick-me-up

&gt;&gt;**TBoneTheOriginal:** I mostly love the fact that I get to keep the average person from seeing the horrible posts that get submitted here every day... there are some bad one

&gt;&gt;**Damadawf:** I get to sit on my ass and watch funny videos/gifs and convince myself that I'm being productive in the process. 

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** What I enjoy most about moderatoring /r/IdiotsFightingThings is that I get to be the one to see it all whenever the posts get stuck in the spam filter and the whole moderating thing is what I love to do.

&gt;##7) Would you like to make any closing remarks? (Shameless plugs

&gt;&gt;**TheExtremistModerate:** [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/NJc3m.jpg) a picture of my cat. Karma pls. 

&gt;&gt;**TBoneTheOriginal:** Please continue being idiots. Our subreddit depends on you. Also, so there's my shameless plug in hopes that it picks up some steam. Thanks everyone! 

&gt;&gt;**Damadawf:** Interviews are hard. I struggled answering the other six questions

When everyone is talking about the NSA, sometimes reddit can seem like [one big inside joke.](http://i.imgur.com/qIGBIWf.gif) But don't fret; we aren't all meeting in some back room in an effort to [keep you in the dark.](http://www.insertnu.com/Funny_Images/GIFs/Michael-What-the-office-10400786-400-226.gif) Well that's a lie, [actually we are doing that](http://i.imgur.com/oWA2APV.gif), all the time in fact, [but it's for your own good.](http://s4d3.turboimagehost.com/t1/15227186_dead_nt.gif) Enough about us though, let's talk about a brand new resource which has emerged from the subreddit soup and is going to be your go-to for dealing with that [uneasy confusion](http://i.imgur.com/Vg786XM.gif) which you constantly suffer from.

It's called /r/OutOfTheLoop. Basically you go there

I spoke with the mods to gain insight.

&gt;1) How do you feel about the current highly meta state of reddit?

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** There aren't many subreddits in which you can.have actual discussion without all the clutter of overused jokes.

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** I like it. I like that the community is self aware

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** That's a loaded question

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** It's funny.

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** I'm so amazed by the fact that a lot of people in reddit get involved in helping each other and participate in everything that this site has to offer. But the thing that is really amazing to me is that subreddits can emerge and get big by just a comment in a popular thread. A lot of redditors just get behind the subreddits that are in a way cool to them

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** I think it's interesting to watch.

&gt;2) When you see a new question on the subreddit

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** I just hop in and hope what I'm saying is true.

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** I like to have a few links in my explanations

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Very rarely do I answer questions

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** I swear to you that every time I go to answer a question someone has beaten me to it in a way that I cannot top. I answer the questions I know how to answer well! I feel like already knowing a lot about something makes it easier to explain to someone.

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** I'm not a very smart person and whatever that comes out of my mouth would make me sound stupid. That's why I would do my research first before answering any question.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** I don't answer a question unless I know a fair bit about the subject matter. If I do know a little bit

&gt;3) Is OutOfTheLoop a euphemism for something?

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** I don't think so.

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** What

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** No Comment

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** http://i.imgur.com/nU0VWxl.gif

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** No

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=out%20of%20the%20loop

&gt;4) Obviously there are many subreddits that compete with yours

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** Refer to my answer to question one.

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** /r/outoftheloop is meant to be help /r/askreddit

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** A place like /r/AskReddit is more for discussions and story telling, Broken Arms, etc)

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** Lots of questions get asked in askreddit that I feel are never answered appropriately because they aren't meant for that sub

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** People who want their questions to be actually answered should head over to /r/OutOfTheLoop. AskReddit is bombarded by non-serious comments and the same old questions everyday. /r/OutOfTheLoop is the place for redditors who want to get up-to-date with the current news stories

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** We were not created to compete with AskReddit, topics, and references.

&gt;5) What was the most difficult question poised to you thus far?

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** ""What's /r/circlejerk about?"" As that being my most visited sub and honestly having no clue what say

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** Most of 'em have been pretty easy

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Anything involving /u/Warlizard because there is nothing to be out of the loop about. Everyone knows he ran the biggest and most popular gaming forum of all time.

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** ""What is the ""chive on"" thing?"" I went to get my brother to answer it since he uses that website. Took a lot of work

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** None of them. Because I haven't tried to answer any of them.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** NSA questions were kinda complicated to answer and understand.

&gt;6) To flip that last one

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** ""What are bitcoins?"" That thread got raid by /r/bitcoin and they started attacking one of the other mod's answer. What makes it even worse is that I asked the question.

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** ...

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1gnhhb/kids_love_cinnamon_crunch/

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** I never knew the background to ""Not since the accident""

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1gnd0q/whats_with_the/)

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Can't really think of any like that.

&gt;7) I used that ancient meme to prove how out of the loop I am. What are some current things I should be aware of?

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** The whole Domestic Surveillance issue. NSA is literally Hitler

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** /r/earthporn is going to have t-shirts soon and you're going to post a picture of yourself climbing and wearing one.

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** I hear ""Instructions not clear

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** SomethingSomethingGoldenCorral

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** Cats go meow meow ow ^just^made^that^up^lol

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Golden Corral is literally hitler

&gt;8) What did you have for lunch today?

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** Crab Tostadas

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** Like 3 pounds of steak and potatoes.

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Food.

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** I slept in until 4 and missed lunch.

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** My grandma's food.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Haven't had lunch yet. So

&gt;8) Are there any other subreddits that you would like to give props

&gt;&gt;**pyrowolf8:** /r/NoStupidQuestions and /r/Braveryjerk.

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** Check out : 

&gt;&gt; /r/listentothis; an awesome sub for music

&gt;&gt; /r/museumofreddit; sort of a /r/bestof for historical reddit stuff

&gt;&gt; /r/ideasforaskreddit; /r/askreddit's meta sub.

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** /r/2007scape - If you're a fan of old runescape and not the new runescape.

&gt;&gt; /r/horsemask - :)

&gt;&gt;/r/NoStupidQuestions - Just like /r/OutOfTheLoop except for all kinds of different questions.

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** /r/naturegifs is a new completely irrelevant sub

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** /r/CanYouDoThis - I like the challenges

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Another very similar subreddit, for those little questions that always bug you (do you use shampoo and conditioner at the same time or one after another? Is the word dictionary in the dictionary? Why isn't isn't eleven called one-ty one?)

Slothy sloths. [They are so cute!](http://i.imgur.com/5yYXQtg.gif) And [cool as a cucumber.](http://i.imgur.com/uqd9tsx.gif) That's why I thought it would be a slick idea to feature them for a [third time on /r/subredditoftheday.](http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/thefw.com/files/2013/03/dealwithit.gif)

Just to bring you up to speed (see what I did there?) wikipedia notes that ""Sloths are medium-sized mammals belonging to the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloth) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloth), and are known for being slow-moving, and hence named ""sloths"". Extinct sloth species include many ground sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants.""

Some more interesting facts about sloths:

* Sloths rely on their [lack of movement as a defense.](http://i.imgur.com/VUxmFWk.gif)

* Sloths can hang effortlessly from branches due to their specialized curved claws.

* If pursued

* If a sloth likes it

Some things a sloth is not:

* [A sloth is not a beaver](http://i.imgur.com/iCglRnx.gif)

* [A sloth is not a cat](http://i.imgur.com/zhVYlsK.gif)

* [A sloth is not a stuffed animal](http://i.imgur.com/CPCiKUe.gif)

I spoke to the not-so-slothy mods to find out more.

&gt;1) The last time we met up with /r/sloths you had just over 6

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Magic. Actually I'm not sure

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** I think it was a multitude of things. Sloths became a trend, who has been instrumental in making us bigger.

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** I've seen /r/sloths in all sorts of places

&gt;2) What are some of your favourite sloth friendly posts over the last 6 months?

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Pretty much all of Shitty's ones. [Especially this one.](http://i.imgur.com/kycWy8U.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** We get a lot of great posts but [this,](http://i.minus.com/i3ZN2SlAn7MEs.gif) and everything /u/Shitty_Watercolour has posted on /r/sloths would be my favorites.

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** /u/Shitty_Watercolour makes fantastic paintings. I am a proud owner of two of them! I also particularly enjoyed [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/sloths/comments/1h20vt/i_turned_myself_into_a_sloth_i_got_betterxpost/) post from /u/Hay_ewe

&gt;3) /u/Shitty_Watercolour made a really nice redditshirt of a sloth. How do you feel about this and how many of them do you have?

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** It's bootiful. I own none. Shitty should send me one because I keep talking about him.

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** I love it! I don't own any but it is a pretty awesome shirt

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** Reddit and sloths all on a T-Shirt? You can't get better than that. I've been meaning to get one

&gt;4) What was your most ""sloth-like"" moment so far this summer?

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** I accidentally grabbed my arm instead of a branch and fell and died. It wasn't pleasant. ^Fo' ^real ^it'd ^be ^that ^I ^slept ^for ^like ^13 ^hours ^a ^couple ^days ^ago. ^Felt ^good.

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** My most sloth-like moment this summer has been the whole summer - I haven't done much. I just sloth around all day and sleep in trees.

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** I [sleep](http://i.imgur.com/kO21DNp.gif) and [eat](http://i.imgur.com/ZINvjWj.gif) all day

&gt;5) Any other projects you would like people to know about?

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** We're working with /u/Shitty_Watercolour to make a contest/fundraiser to benefit a sloth sanctuary. He will give the top donor(s) a sloth painting and we would get the sanctuary to throw in some prizes to the top donors. It's still a work in progress and we're still trying to find a sanctuary to partner with but hopefully we can get the contest started soon. We also just started a project with the other sloth-subs, and /r/SlothsWithBeaks to create a sloth network and sloth multireddit.

&gt;&gt;**theNYEHHH:** 

&gt;&gt;http://i.imgur.com/nPwcUXS.gif

&gt;&gt;This question confused me so I'm shamelessly plugging in /r/naturegifs.

&gt;&gt;There can be sloths there too.

**7550 readers** for **1 year!**

We have all looked at a map of the world and dreamed ourselves its conqueror. Riding into battle on a horse, and blood is your wine. You rule the world, its undisputed warlord. Or will you rule the world through science or trade? Paradox is the king of grand strategy games. The geniuses behind [many great games](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games), namely Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis, have everything under control. Their inability to make tutorials is legendary, but so is their ability to make the most realistic strategy this side of the Milky Way.

I suck at strategy games. Yep, with about as little explanation. The tutorial is, I'm sorry to say, a pile of smashed tits. It explains the basics of the game, but not how to play it. Fortunately, the Paradox games have a thriving community, with loads of tutorials, videos, and decorative handbaskets. Where

/r/ParadoxPlaza is the consortium of Paradox game subreddits, /r/eu3 and /r/eu4, /r/crusaderkings, /r/waroftheroses, and /r/evw. Since ~~we don't have enough time~~ I'm too lazy to feature all these subreddits, this one is what we're working with. Subreddits associated, consider yourselves partial SRotD. You may eat a partial cake to partially celebrate.

""But Xavier, you temptress, and I don't mind. Paradox doesn't appear to want to *sell* any of these games. They just dump the games into the world, drop the mic, and hop off stage to pile of money. Their audience is specific and knows what it wants, so Paradox doesn't need a huge marketing budget. That said, if Paradox wants to leave a bag of money on my doorstep

In order to whore myself out even further

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**Meneth** I'm Meneth, as well as haven written a major guide for Crusader Kings II, developing a CKII mod, and running wikis for Crusader Kings II and Victoria 2. I hope to improve the community through my participation in it.

&gt;&gt;**FlyingSpaghettiMan** I'm an old Paradoxian from the days of Eu2 and Victoria 1. I've been addicted to this stuff ever since. I picked up the games around 2005

&gt;&gt;**Derkrieger** I discovered Paradox games years ago back when they were still in boxes yet never had the attention span nor money to justify getting them then picked EU3 up on steam one fateful day. I have been hooked ever since.

&gt;#2. What would you say is your favorite Paradox game?

&gt;&gt;**Meneth** Crusader Kings II is definitely my favorite Paradox game. This is where I've focused most of my community efforts

&gt;&gt;**FlyingSpaghettiMan** It is actually a really hard choice for me to choose my favorite game. I'd personally say EU3

&gt;&gt;**Derkrieger** Probably still EU3 although CK2 has had some moments that may challenge that. I just love the sheer scope of the Europa series and the fact that it brings a little of everything to the table.

&gt;#3. If you could add any one thing to one of their games

&gt;&gt;**Meneth** More modding features. Paradox are already one of the most mod-friendly dev teams out there

&gt;&gt;**FlyingSpaghettiMan** Paradox is known for its... shitty multiplayer. Hopefully they will fix this in EU4

&gt;&gt;**Derkrieger** The movement system from Knights of Honor where the provinces still existed but you could move freely within them. This allowed your armies the ability to do things like block an important mountain pass making it difficult for the enemy to cross without going through you.

&gt;#4. If you could give any tip to a player first discovering Paradox's strategy games

&gt;&gt;**Meneth** Don't give up. Getting into any Paradox game is difficult

&gt;&gt;**FlyingSpaghettiMan** The UI is pretty complicated, I am still learning things about the game. So, getting past the UI is a very important thing, and once you get past that issue the games are extremely replayable.

&gt;&gt;**Derkrieger** EU3 Complete is not complete. Also do not be discouraged because you will fail at first. Like at least a few times and wonder how you ran your nation into the ground and thats normal. If you can stay positive and learn from those defeats you just may find a gaming experience you cannot get many other places.

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch. Anything else you want to tell the world?

&gt;&gt;**Meneth** Have fun conquering the world.

&gt;&gt;**FlyingSpaghettiMan** Get EU4

&gt;&gt;**Derkrieger** Ppppssst....play Fire Emblem Awakening if you get the chance

Grand strategy is easily the most personally rewarding game genre out there today. The skills (and history) it teaches you are invaluable. Like any great thing though

This has been your favorite writer on the citadel

*A brief intro for those of you wondering what the hell a ""Furtive Pygmy"" or ""Dark Souls"" is...*

Dark Souls is a very challenging 3rd person role-playing game that was released in America last October

The story goes that in Dark Souls' world, the Lord of Sunlight; the [Witch of Izalith](http://i.imgur.com/Uy4US.jpg); [Nito](http://sin.stb.s-msn.com/i/D9/ADDFB275564951E0CBB3FE5C7C8758.jpg), First of the Dead; and the [*Furtive Pygmy*](http://www.beardednerd.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/darksouls_pygmy.jpg) -who each found a Lord Soul and gained incredible powers from it. They went on to destroy the dragons with their powers and start an ""Age of Fire,"" becoming gods and erecting great cities for themselves...

That is except for the pygmy

In some countries

In others, in an attempt to prove themselves to be the [Chosen Undead](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Chosen_Undead) who was foretold to be the one who would renew the dwindling Age of Fire and so end the Undeads' curse... 


#**Now to talk about /r/DarkSouls!**

/r/DarkSouls is a wonderful sub, very little karma whoring) and where you'll still see [new discussions about this game's lore](http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/15gw9x/havel_the_rock_is_the_dead_body_that_holds_the/).

Here you'll also find that the spirit of good gamership is still alive, and [a poor redditor being gifted the game](http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/15fdii/i_really_want_to_play_dark_souls_a_request/) thanks to another's kindness and/or sadism (""When they gave it to you. It basically destined you to suffering in Lordran. I think it balances out."").

In my 1+ year on Reddit

It's hard to finger *exactly* what has helped make /r/DarkSouls have such a great community (Is it something about the game itself? The type of people drawn to the game?) but I'm sure that part of the sub's success has to do with /r/DarkSouls' [very pro-active](http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/123m3w/rdarksouls_announcement_regarding_the_solaire/) mods who are all also [fans of the game](http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/yomdq/rdarksouls_is_looking_for_moderators_and_steam/). 

      
Speaking of which, /u/ParanoidAndroids, /u/LivingInFilth** and **/u/saioke**! 

Let's give them all a [warm welcome](http://fireden.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Dark-Souls-General83.gif)!



&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/DarkSouls?

&gt;&gt;**ChingShih**: /r/darksouls was created to be as much a spiritual successor to /r/demonssouls as the game Dark Souls was to Demon's Souls.

&gt;&gt;Some of the regulars on /r/demonssouls had discussed what it would take to properly promote the game that was at that time known only as ""[Project Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEYwCIc0UjQ)"" across Reddit and

&gt;&gt;[W]e picked up the /r/darksouls sub-reddit name as soon as the official title was announced so that we could have a hand in crafting the best possible community for the game. ...

&gt;&gt;**timeshaper**: When ""Dark Souls"" the game's launch was nigh

&gt;2.What about Dark Souls appeals to you the most

&gt;&gt;**ParanoidAndroids**: The atmosphere and game mechanics are what sets Dark Souls apart from every other game I've played in the last 10 years. The game ditches the modern mechanic of ""hand-holding"" and throws you into this desolate and decaying world, and hollows, and forces you to constantly adapt to survive. It is challenging, for sure, but it is practically never cheap (only instance I can think of is the Bed of Chaos boss fight), and the game mechanics are so sound that every death is the players' fault (PVP notwithstanding).

&gt;&gt;**LivingInFilth**: Chills running down your spine from that opening as you awaken in your cell. You're still confused as to why that guy dropped the key and then just took off without telling you shit. 

&gt;&gt;While you make your way down the first hallway, you bravely decide to ignore it. Fighting vicious dredglings along the way, you slowly climb a rusty ladder, finally spotting daylight and what seems to be a place to rest your weary bones. Sitting down, you realize there is absolutely nothing here to help you. A giant door right in front of you, daring you to open it. You press on, tightly grasping your toothpick of weapon, a giant monstrosity descends on you from the ceiling. The doors behind you closed

&gt;&gt;A tiny opening on the left

&gt;&gt;You get up as fast as you can and start running. Behind you, your humanity. **Dark Souls**.

&gt;&gt;**ChingShih**: The dark loneliness of the world

&gt;&gt;**timeshaper**: I'm a fan of upgrading, you will mop that floor again. You will die. I spent only 150ish hours dying between PS3 and PC as I have so many games to play sadly. Dark Souls, however, will never be put away permanently like the others...

&gt;&gt;**saioke** Personally, I was a bit skeptical. Until I played it and then I fell in love. So when I heard about Dark Souls, my memories and joy from playing Demon's Souls came back to me. So, for me, every aspect in Dark Souls is perfect. Both, the combat and movement are fluid. The environments - Are all different and amazing. From the spooky and depressive Blightown, to the beautiful and majestic Anor Londo. Every area you enter, is the fact that each character has a purpose and a storyline for being in the world and to me

&gt;3.What's modding the community been like

&gt;&gt;**ParanoidAndroids**: Moderating the sub has never been very challenging because the subscribers are very committed and serious about Dark Souls. A lot of the humorous/joke-based posts on the subreddit come from user-made comics about various parts of the game

&gt;&gt;**ChingShih**: We do have Posting Guidelines listed in the sub-reddit's menu bar

&gt;&gt;**timeshaper**: The rules are there in a link and are pretty clear cut and fair. We are extremely tight on not allowing memes as ChingShih and I agreed from the very beginning that we did not want this subreddit to share the fates of so many others. While this led to some bumps and bruises as we rapidly grew in our opening days as the community experienced some growing pains

&gt;4.Tell me about your greatest acheivement in Dark Souls to date.

&gt;&gt;**ParanoidAndroids**: My greatest achievement? Hmmm... I still think making it through Sen's Fortress in one run on my first playthrough still eclipses any of the other things I've done in the game. Oddly enough

&gt;&gt;**LivingInFilth**: Helping numerous people through the game from all over the world; Germany, Belgium, Norway, Austria, Canada and Spain being among the ones I remember very well. ...

&gt;&gt;**ChingShih**: Over 200 hours into the game and I still haven't finished the DLC or collected all the unique items. =( My greatest achievement is helping other players!

&gt;&gt;**timeshaper**: I was scared to death of Ornstein &amp; Smough. I was playing the game slower than many others and I had heard so many horrible stories of people getting owned hundreds of times in a row. I nobly requested (there was some begging involved maybe) the assistance of ChingShih and one of our regulars from the Ventrilo setup we have. Unfortunately for me

&gt;&gt;**saioke** My greatest achievement huh? Hmm, I did kill Ornstein and Smough on my second try on normal difficulty. To be honest, the hardest boss for me, at the very beginning, was the Gaping Dragon, but that was mainly because my character was very slow and couldn't run or roll fast enough to get out of the dragon's charging attack.

&gt;5.Quick: what's your favorite covenant and why?

&gt;&gt;**ParanoidAndroids**: The Sunbros (Warriors of Sunlight) are such an awesome covenant... I honestly believe playing cooperatively all the way through Anor Londo is one of my favorite experiences in gaming ever. Whether you are the one being helped, the Darkwraith covenant is done extremely well - that sinking feeling when someone invades in the darkness of the Tomb of the Giants simply cannot be beaten in terms of scaring the shit out of you.

&gt;&gt;**LivingInFilth**: Gravelord Covenant

&gt;&gt;**ChingShih**: I like the idea behind the Blade of the Darkmoon Covenant the best. It's a twisted cross between revenge

&gt;&gt;**timeshaper**: I have a hard time choosing tbh. I guess the Sunbros because they are always ready to lend a hand in beating some monsters in jolly cooperation.

&gt;&gt;**saioke** My favorite covenant has to be the Gravelord Covenent. There's just something about being a Gravelord that makes you feel great, where you ultimately go toe to toe against each other - It's fantastic!

&gt;6.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**ParanoidAndroids**: Keep up the awesome content! /r/DarkSouls is the best gaming community on reddit

&gt;&gt;**ChingShih**: Creativity and camaraderie are the essence of this community. Keep it up and don't be afraid to post lore hypotheses!

&gt;&gt;**timeshaper**: Full Disclosure: [redacted] and I were contacted [redacted] in order to discuss a couple items... well

&gt;&gt;We would also like to thank darkmodem and barneezyjones for their continued help and support in modding /r/darksouls. Due to the holidays and personal reasons they didn’t have an opportunity to respond to this interview. But we love them anyway! And also thank you to all the volunteers on the Dark Souls Reddit Steamgroup who help keep the online community active!

&gt;&gt;**saioke** Be sure to eat your humanity

Oh /r/Ooer

Where else can you find these subreddits? This subreddit is the nightmare for /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu readers. The font is Comic Sans, and all of it is tagged NSFW, what more can I say? I found this subreddit when I was surfing /r/WTF and searched “subreddit”. I regretfully clicked on the link that took me to /r/Ooer. Nightmares ensued, we’ll get to those later.

I have to give props to the moderators for making a largely confusing subreddit and slightly impressive CSS that is guaranteed to piss off everyone from /r/f7u12

Just because I’m featuring this subreddit doesn’t mean I like it... Okay that’s a straight-up lie, we need those tiny little things!

Now that all of that crap is out of the way and you made it through all of that tiny little text, please, PLEASE don’t go to this subreddit. The first time I went to this subreddit my eyes were LITERALLY aching by the CSS. That’s what caused these nightmares, I had a dream late at night where I was surfing /r/Ooer (because I’m a fuckhead) and those BBC One things on the stylesheet came alive, turned into faces, jumped out of the computer monitor and ate me. My dreams are fucking insane thanks to this subreddit. 

&gt;##1. WHY DID YOU CREATE THIS MONSTROSITY?!??!?!?!?!?!
&gt;&gt; **/u/Ooer** I originally created it just so no one else would. It sat here to stagnate for a while before I had the idea of inviting a few friends to destroy it as best they could.

&gt;##2. Why is this sub so weird?
&gt;&gt; **Ooer** Apparently beer and a lose grasp of CSS knowledge is a bad combination

&gt;&gt;**/u/Skuld** This sub isn't weird

&gt;##3. Did you want anyone to subscribe to /r/Ooer?
&gt;&gt; **Ooer** I would never want to inflict such a visual enslaught to any innocent bystanders. I guess people subscribed in the same manner as you can't help but stop to look at the aftermath of a particularly nasty road accident.

&gt;&gt;**Skuld** There's a subscribe button?

[Stupid reference from the title](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-7gmds2njg)

Coincidentally to the title, bad boys for life.

Super Smash Bros. is one of my favorite games of all time. I’ve played each game in the series and loved every minute of it, it was hard to hate anything about the game. Super Smash Bros. games were made for the sole purpose of being extremely fun, the games aren’t balanced or an exact science they are just plain good old fashioned beating the shit out of people fun. It is wonderful for just messing around and is an excellent platform for shenanigans, as I’m sure you all know because it was a huge part of most of our childhoods. 

SSB is a unique game itself because instead of depleting a characters life bar the object is to knock your opponent off the stage, characters have a damage percentage value, which rises as they take damage and can exceed 100%, but can only reach 999% as a maximum damage a character can take. I mean, I never have personally seen it get anywhere near 999%, my older cousin and I tried once, but James is a lying douchelord. Pretend we are trying to see how high the percentage can go then kill me when I’m down, YOU BASTARD! My personal favorite moment of gameplay was when I ‘down-b’d’ with Fox against his ‘blue balls to the face’ with Samus and sent him hurtling into miserable failure. He then later made up the excuse that he had “become used to GameCube controllers.” Whatever...

The game has stayed with me since the original on the 64 when I wanted to smash my brother’s face in and then to Brawl on the Wii when I wanted to get smashed with my bros. 

SSB, no doubt. 

And now back to our regularly scheduled programming with the head mod Mr. /u/Elbedhar

&gt;##1. Why did you create a community for this game?

&gt;&gt;**Elbedhar:** Over the past few years, but most people are unaware of the worldwide underground tournament scene that accompanies it. That said, many submissions to r/smashbros are related to competitive Super Smash Bros. tournaments, players, videos, and strategies.

&gt;##2. What is the first Smash Bros. game you played?

&gt;&gt;**Elbedhar:** I started off with the original on N64. It's actually rather funny how I first got into the series. At summer camp I overheard some people talking about this new Nintendo game with Mario, etc. all in the same game. I misinterpreted that to mean that Nintendo made an adventure game featuring all of their recognizable characters. My parents got me the game and that's when I realized that SSB was actually a goofy fighting game. Turns out that was the one of the best mistakes of my life, since up til that point I thought I disliked fighting games.

&gt;##3. Greatest memory from one of the games?

&gt;&gt;**Elbedhar:** I think all of my best memories, during a tournament called Pound V, Armada (world's best Melee player - he actually just did an AMA with us last month) debuted his top-secret Young Link against Hungrybox's Jigglypuff. Armada hadn't ever defeated Hungrybox up until that point, and Young Link is a subpar character rarely used in tournaments, especially at top-level play. Many people initially thought it was a joke but it actually ended up working.
Honorable mentions to Mango's Rest on Armada

&gt;##4. Is Super Smash Bros. your favorite game

&gt;&gt;**Elbedhar:** I think comparing single player and multiplayer games is an unfair comparison

&gt;##5. How many hours would you assume you’ve played this game?

&gt;&gt;**Elbedhar:** Far too many to count! I'd check my Melee memory card for the data but I don't have it with me at the moment. However, and Smash 64 online via Project64k.

&gt;##6. Have all the mods ever gotten together to play in a tournament?

&gt;&gt;**Elbedhar:** That isn't something that we've done. I've been to tournaments that ChiboSempai was at but I don't think I've ever played against him. I don't believe the other moderators play the game competitively.

&gt;##7. Would you like to add anything

&gt;&gt;**Elbedhar:** Whether you prefer playing in tournaments or enjoy casually beating up on your friends, but I also hope that everyone takes a look at the tournament-related content that people are submitting. Competitive Smash is a wildly exciting E-sport that continues to attract players from all corners of the world.

Alright folks, monsters, ghosts, robots, demons (Oh my!) and everything in between has been explored. No sci fi stone unchecked. If you like any branch of sci fi The Doctor has covered it, in some form.

Doctor Who returned to TV after a long hiatus back in 2005 with a much welcome response. Since then 3 actors have already taken the mantle of The Doctor. Each with his own lovable personality


&gt;What got you to like DoctorWho?
&gt;&gt; For me, have always, in my opinion, been more interesting and creative than American TV (don't get me wrong, I love [StarTrek:The Next Generation](/r/startrek) and [STARWARS](/r/STARWARS) and [Firefly](/r/firefly) too - they were situationally creative though there is a lot of resorting-to-guns situations). When I say creative, I mean in terms of situational creativity.

&gt;Who is your favorite actor to play Doctor Who? Why?
&gt;&gt; Hard choice. For (the new Doctor) Who (series)

&gt;So whats your favorite episode?
&gt;&gt; Blink, Family of Blood twopisode, and as much as it is cheesy - I liked both Journey's End and A Good Man Goes To War.

We make choices every day. If it's about the colour of your socks or if you can still eat that expired milk or not

But you may not realise how important daily questions are. If you thought about it a bit longer you'd knew that your mother was taking a shower and just forgot to lock the door.  *[Suppressed childhood memories](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrXZje-KQDg)*

This subreddit learns you that *choices matter*. The hard way: using russian roulette. I only think it's worse than russian roulette

You see

You got two choices: take the risk and pull the trigger or walk along not knowing what it could be. You may think the second option is a bad one

The mods can explain it even better

This subreddit is awesome and really worth subscribing.
I have only one more thing to say: [be strong](http://i.imgur.com/EjIFM.gif)

&gt;#1. Can you tell me what /r/FiftyFifty is in a nutshell?
&gt;&gt;    **topodan**    /r/FiftyFifty distills the classic Reddit ""risky click"" into its own experience. Post titles list the possible outcomes of following the link in the form ""Emma Watson nudes | Spastic colon fallout"". One title is encouraging enough to entice people to click

&gt;&gt;    **battlesmurf**    A game of virtual russian roulette sort of. It's such a great idea because it allows you to play a game on reddit while you are bored

&gt;&gt;    **drumcowski**    /r/FiftyFifty is essentially a game of Reddit Roulette...or ""Risky Click - The Subreddit"".

&gt;# 2. What is the reason you like to take these risks?
&gt;&gt;    **topodan**    The risk taking is a bit addictive. You have to play almost every link for the same reason you follow an ambiguously titled image posted in comments thinking ""mistake, and I thought ""Hey, I might know somewhere this belongs."" I brought the idea to Reddit with an overwhelmingly positive response. 

&gt;&gt;    **battlesmurf**    Because it is incredibly fun! I was with some of my friends the other day while on holiday and we'd all guess what the post would be

&gt;&gt;    **drumcowski**    I like to live dangerously

&gt;#3. What is your favorite fifty fifty so far?
&gt;&gt;    **topodan**    If I had to pick a ""classic"" FiftyFifty

&gt;&gt;    **battlesmurf**    I really liked [Ex g[f] posing nude | [M]e posing nude](http://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/comments/15ypgc/ex_gf_posing_nude_me_posing_nude/) it was absolutely hilarious

&gt;&gt;    **drumcowski**    [A picture of the effects of mercury on the brain or a friendly Italian man wearing a taco costume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/comments/15xm8j/a_picture_of_the_effects_of_mercury_on_the_brain/)


 &gt;#4. What are the boundaries of the posts?
&gt;&gt;    **topodan**    We do have limits. If one of the options is NSFL (whether you post the good or the bad link)

&gt;&gt;    **battlesmurf**    Nothing incredibly messed up, that sort of stuff, that you wouldn't even see on /r/wtf.

&gt;&gt;    **drumcowski**    Must have exactly two options

&gt;#5. What is the community like?
&gt;&gt;    **topodan**    The community is pretty diverse and very active. It seems to be slightly more mature than the average reddit thread in the comments, it is also the fastest growing community on Reddit!

&gt;&gt;    **battlesmurf**    Fantastic community! And I can only hope it will grow even more. Looking through the comments is great because people always uphold the rules in the sidebar

&gt;#6. Anything you'd like to add?
&gt;&gt;    **topodan**    I'd just like to thank my fellow moderators who have been there since that night I got drunk, structured site.

Today we celebrate a community of redditors drawn together by their interest in firearms.  Let's look at the facts and uncover why we're featuring [/r/guns](/r/guns).

1.  By my rough estimate

2.  The comment section is incredibly active - the majority of posts have over 30 comments.  Conclusion... either the posts are incredibly compelling and folks want to chime in

3.  Two words

4.  Really neat community activities like Secret Santa

5.  Mature

You've got a good community /r/guns.  You've created a virtual neighbourhood where everyone who lives there, opinions and discussion.  Thanks very much for offering this corner of the world to redditors.

Here to discuss [/r/guns](/r/guns) is moderator IronChin.

&gt;Please describe your subreddit and your community.

&gt;&gt;A group of like-minded firearms enthusiasts and collectors

&gt;&gt;In short

&gt;What things go on at /r/guns besides typical posts/comments? (please discuss the gunnit matches and anything else happening).

&gt;&gt;Nothing drastically different from other subs

&gt;&gt;The matches are just that, you get the corresponding custom flair for winning, and the option to make and judge the match the following month.  Like I said, this is done entirely on the honor system. If you say you did it, we take you at your word.

&gt;Guns can be quite divisive

&gt;&gt;Of course. Not to belabor the point, et cetera, get more than their fair share of trolls and people posting inflammatory stuff just to get a reaction.

&gt;Hobbies like snowboarding or knitting I can understand. But to those of us who know little about guns

&gt;&gt;No. The best I can do is tell you to go down to your local range that has guns for rent, and have at it. If you're not bitten by the shooting bug after that, you probably never will be.

&gt;&gt;Speaking strictly for myself, 365 days a year, regardless of temperature or weather. I cannot go a single day without the wonderful smell of burnt gunpowder in my nostrils.

&gt;Now

&gt;&gt;/r/guns is easily the most diverse group of people on Reddit, all races, creeds, colors, genders, and sexual orientations. We are (for the most part) the absolute least judgmental group of people on Reddit, and that is a point of pride for me

&gt;&gt;It's been an honor to be a janitor on /r/guns so far.

It was a cold day outside. Very cold. So cold that even inside the warehouse itself I had to wear a sweater as the Michigan winter was determined to freeze me to death regardless of any shelter. So when the UPS delivery truck pulled up to our docks I should have been dreading having to open the doors to check-in the morning delivery. But I wasn't. Why?

*Because the rest of my computer was coming today!*

Like many aspiring computer geeks I had long wanted to build my own personal computer. For years I had tinkered with machines, I had never actually built my own machine from scratch. Why? Mostly lack of confidence. After all, spending ~$1,000 on all the necessary parts only to find out I had no idea how to actually put them together seemed too big a risk.

This time was different. This time I had /r/buildapc on my side.

More than two months prior to that cold winter day I spent a great deal of time with the self-proclaimed builders. I asked questions about various components and received a lot of great advice. In that time I must have changed my build about a thousand times but the self-proclaimed builders never seemed to mind. Always and with every post I received lots of great suggestions

The advantages of doing so are clear: you get the exact kind of machine you want for a much cheaper price than you would have to pay at one of the Big Box stores. The advantages of having access to /r/buildapc are even more clear: the helpful builders there are always willing to give advice

Recently I met up with moderators and ACDCGAMER and LieutenantClone via telegram to ask them a few questions. Here is the translated-from-morse-code transcript of our conversation.

&gt;Let's start at the very beginning (a very good place to start): what is /r/buildapc about and why would a redditor want to subscribe to it?

&gt;&gt;**ADCDGAMER** /r/buildapc, but we also focus on getting the most out of your money for the system that you build, whether it's a gaming rig, a computer made for graphic design/multimedia, etc. Another focus that I've noticed in this community is that we keep an eye on the state of computer hardware, be it new graphics cards, new CPUs (like AMD's upcoming Bulldozer CPUs, computer parts retailers/vendors like Newegg, however? If you're interested in building your own, among many others

&gt;Why focus only on building PC's? Why not /r/build-a-PC-or-a-Mac

&gt;&gt;**ACDCGAMER** I'm going to answer this question with another question: does PC mean a computer that runs only Windows or something other than a Mac operating system? To me, anything, be it something made by Dell, HP, or Apple for the general consumer, is a personal computer. I personally don't understand how or why this assumption came to be, but I just wanted to clarify this. Anyways, but it's that the vast majority of our users that are building systems have a personal preference for Windows for most (if not all) of their applications. Gaming is a huge factor, we just simply get way more posts that focus on a Windows/Linux system rather than a Mac OSX system.

&gt;&gt;**LieutenantClone** Fun Fact: It was Apple themselves who pushed the term ""PC"" as being used for Windows, back in the old days, their machines were officially called an ""Apple Personal Computer""

&gt;I frequented your /r/ when I was building my current machine but

&gt;&gt;**ACDCGAMER**I honestly don't feel that I'm taken advantage of. I'm just glad to help new PC builders build awesome systems for their own benefit! Not everyone has to be dedicated to the point where they're eyeing price drops on websites like Newegg/NCIX or discussing recent events in relation to computer hardware (such as if AMD delayed the release of their new 7000 series graphics cards).

&gt;What's the best build you've seen posted to your /r/? For us dummies, its cost-to-performance ratio, something else? 

&gt;&gt;**ACDCGAMER** There are a lot of great builds I've seen, crammed) a quad-core Intel/Radeon HD 6950 computer inside a form factor roughly the size of a PlayStation 3. To be able to fit that amount of raw gaming power inside such a small case is just astounding! I also love any build that uses a nice case like the Corsair 600T and really puts some effort into making their rig look as tidy as possible.


&gt;You've probably seen a lot of posts from people new to the idea of building their own machine. What is the biggest mistake such amateurs usually make?

&gt;&gt;**ACDCGAMER** I say the biggest mistake is not getting a good power supply for their system. If you're going to be running games or doing anything remotely taxing power-wise on your system, and if it dies out on you, it can potentially fry several other components of yours in the process. If you're out of warranty, that means you need to buy new parts, which is a huge headache and it leaves a bigger hole in your wallet. This is from my perspective, however, although a lot of others share this viewpoint.

The Wikipedia page tells me that the Red Panda is also known as a *lesser panda* and I for one resent that name. I for one believe that the Red Panda actually have a passive super power that turns grown men and women into a mess of [squeals](http://www.mtviggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/redpanda.jpg) and [d'awws](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk6x8jEPh41qa97wjo1_500.jpg).

Plus they're tiny so [you can just lock them outside](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m94f7efJ861rce69vo1_400.gif) if you like

Yup. I've fallen in love with /r/redpandas. They look like real life Pokemon and they would officially be called ""Randa"" because Pokemon have stupid names and [this is what happens when a Randa fights a Randa](http://i.imgur.com/62VBbBy.jpg) and this is what happens [after a battle](http://i.imgur.com/pOrMxF7.jpg). Not to be a downer but the other Randa died. Ha not really. [Here they are playing together just last week](http://photos.zoochat.com/large/red_panda_and_cub_3-124714.jpg) and they're definitely the same Randas. Probably. 

Enough of my drivel. The Red Panda is a radical animal and it should be relished in all its beautiful little glory. Even if they're mischievous critters that try to rob your house

I asked /r/redpandas about their subreddit:

&gt;##1. How did /r/redpandas start?

&gt;&gt; **NEWSBOT3** Well, so i looked for a reddit community and it was inactive. One message to the admins later, and the subreddit was mine, mwhahahahahaha :D and then i started finding content from a few zoos that i know and follow on twitter/facebook.

&gt;&gt; **NEWSBOT3** Argh, those are always pretty cool.

&gt;##3. What's so great about Red Pandas?

&gt;&gt; **NEWSBOT3** Lots of things! They are very cute to look at

&gt;##4. If you were a Red Panda for a day

&gt;&gt; **NEWSBOT3** Sleep a lot, that'd be cool. The videos on youtube of red pandas doing that look like they are having a great time.

&gt;##5. Would you like to say anything to your Subscribers?

Videos are a reflection of life, music videos, pornography, and just about anything else is a reflection of what we do in life. Society is a group of folks that interact with each other using their common interests. But on the outskirts of that society, even outside society, are the others. The people that do things that nobody sees, or doesn't want to talk about. Sometimes these people create videos. Sometimes they upload them to YouTube. Coming to you from reddit is /r/DeepIntoYouTube

DeepIntoYouTube, or the most horrible, and it doesn't claim the top spot in ""deepness"" either. DIYT, however, has something other video repositories does not: A community around it. Sitting at just over 1,000 subscribers, DIYT continues to deliver the weird stuff for your venturing amusement. We've all seen a weird video here or there

Before I forget: /r/DeepIntoYouTube is a video sub

I sent the moderators a carrier pigeon along with my questions

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**BrastaSauce** I'm a young programmer who has always wanted to run some type of website thing. So I made a subreddit with a purpose and to help me with my CSS.

&gt;&gt;**WheresMyHouse** I'm 25 years old and one of the 14 billion engineering students on Reddit. My excuse for not having my Bachelor's yet is in part due to the fact that I've spent a good portion of time in the military.

&gt;&gt;**BrastaSauce** [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeepIntoYouTube/comments/1b0a4d/the_wolfgore_show_has_bouts_of_popularity_but/) definitely has to be my favorite video here. Friends and I laughed at it for weeks!

&gt;#3. What disturbed you the most out of everything submitted here?

&gt;&gt;**BrastaSauce** Well

&gt;&gt;**WheresMyHouse** I've spent so much of my own time dredging up these videos that I think I may have become desensitized

&gt;#4. Any other subreddits like this one you might recommend to people?

&gt;&gt;**BrastaSauce** Well, more moderators, CSS scripting, and an overall great community.

&gt;&gt;**WheresMyHouse** BrastaSauce already mentioned /r/theendofyoutube. That's really the only thing I can think of that really falls in line with what we try to do. I did spend quite a lot of time on /r/woahdude at one point.

&gt;&gt;**WheresMyHouse** I want to say thank you to our subscriber base. I really feel that they constitute what has become one of the best communities on Reddit.

Ah, what genius.

For those people who haven’t heard of CAH before, then one player is chosen to be the Card Czar. The Card Czar then gets one black card from the deck and reads it out to everyone. For example: the Card Czar has said this black card: **War! What is it good for?** And now everyone (except the Card Czar) gets their white cards out and they have to answer the question using their most offensive/funny white card. Example: **War! What is it good for? Racism.** When all the players have played their white card, the Czar then chooses which card s/he thinks is the best. The person who played the card that the Czar chose gets the black card as one Awesome Point. The first to a certain amount of Awesome Points wins!

Now that example I gave you is just the tip of the iceberg, not just questions. This game was funded with Kickstarter around two years ago, and it exceeded its goal by over THREE HUNDRED MOTHERFUCKING PERCENT! That proves that there is a lot of dirty little shits in the world (like me!).

This subreddit showcases all the gold that Cards Against Humanity has to offer, what the hell, or [this one](http://i.imgur.com/JFutq.jpg). This game is really fucked up, I know. But there is a softer side to all of this though, [someone proposed to their girlfriend while playing this game](http://i.imgur.com/UL0JLlZ.jpg). Aside from that, a lot of people will be offended. Make sure you don’t have any kids in the room while playing this game. Should we have an interview with the moderators of this subreddit? I think so.

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create /r/cardsagainsthumanity?
&gt;&gt; **DaveQat** It seemed like a great way to share the... unique joys of the game.

&gt;##2. When was the first time you've heard of Cards Against Humanity?
&gt;&gt; **DaveQat** At a New Year's Eve party in 2011 - playing with a bunch of awesome and horrible people

&gt;##3. How many times have you played Cards Against Humanity?
&gt;&gt; **DaveQat** Dozens. It's a very common request when hanging out with my friends.

&gt;##4. What's your favourite card combination?
&gt;&gt; **DaveQat** Black Card: What gives me uncontrolable gas? White Card: Auschwitz.

&gt;##5. Suggest a black card and white card for CAH.
&gt;&gt; **DaveQat** Black Card: Who's that guy on the other side of the glory hole? White Card: George Lucas' soul-sucking neck parasite.

&gt;##6. What's your advice to first time players?
&gt;&gt; **DaveQat** Get really drunk

&gt;##7. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **DaveQat** Thank you for sharing. It's the kind of sharing that burns

Apple products--especially iDevices (iPads, etc)--tend to carry a [certain stigma](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/zu9fz/apple_sucks_iphone_sucks_samsung_rules_upnokias/) on Reddit. Bringing them up in a thread is likely to insight a negative comment or two. Most Reddit users try to remain a voice of reason, and tread lightly around the subject. There is one thing that *everyone* should agree on, though: A jailbroken iDevice is better than an un-jailbroken one.

You don't need to be extremely tech-savvy to realize that an iDevice, box-like](http://i.imgur.com/x0E2tYw.jpg) fashion… the list goes on. It's frustrating--iDevices have *so* much potential that the original developers left unused. That's where jailbreaking comes in! It unlocks the full abilities that your touch-screen mini-computer should have had from the start!  
Don't just take my word for it

&gt;##Why is a jailbroken device better than an un-jailbroken one?

&gt;&gt; **hizinfiz** For me, the tweak CallBar allows you to receive and make calls in any app or on the lockscreen, all without having to open the phone app. It especially comes in handy if I need to take notes or look something up while I'm in a call. I don't have to dig around for a pen and pencil or call the other person back later.
One of the cool things that jailbreaking can do (I'm very jealous of Android users for having this functionality) is change the default app in a few instances. We don't have anything nearly as in depth as Android (hopefully that'll change in the future), and YTOpener, allow you to open links in and change the default app to Chrome (or any other browser), Google Maps, and Youtube/Jasmine respectively.
A tweak that I find really useful that many people may not have heard of is Alarming. It allows you to set a default volume for alarms so that no matter what volume your ringer is set at or if you've put the phone in vibrate the alarms will always go off at the same volume. It's something really small and simple
The part of jailbreaking that I'd say is absolutely essential is quick settings toggles. Tweaks like NCSettings, BatteryDoctorPro, Flusterless, and Torch all add toggles that allow you to toggle or change things such as Wifi/Data/3G, Airplane mode, DoNoDisturb, Location Services, and Brightness. Just like BiteSMS and CallBar

The process and execution for jailbreaking can range from very easy to very difficult, a freshly jailbroken iDevice appears to the user identically as it was previously, except for a newly added app, titled 'Cydia'.

Cydia acts as an installer for various 'tweaks', including the ones hizinfiz mentioned above. In order to get the most out of the jailbroken device and your new Cydia app &amp; software, reading and engaging in guides, software recommendations, and discussions are almost a requirement; you can do all of this at /r/jailbreak.

&gt;##What content do you most like to see on /r/jailbreak (themes

&gt;&gt; **hizinfiz** Personally, we've had a lot of really cool tweaks and themes being made by Redditors, and it the creativity and intelligence of the devs and artists is very impressive. I'm especially happy with the way our new theming subreddit /r/iOSthemes is going because we've had a lot of really awesome themes being put out by Redditors there.

&gt;##What is one thing that new subscribers and jailbreakers should know?

&gt;&gt; **hizinfiz** One of the things that I've noticed, but they're scared to go beyond that. So, since we function in part as a help forum, we get a lot of people asking very simple questions that can easily be answered with a 2 minute search either on Google or the subreddit. But I guess my point is not to put my moderator cap on and urge people to use the search function more, but to say, from one user to another, that you shouldn't be afraid to get your feet wet. Of course with the nature of jailbreaking and the community's relationship (or lack thereof) with Apple, but you shouldn't be afraid to experiment and try things out. I'd say this is especially applicable when it comes to theming. Searching for a specific answer is very easy to do,,False

[Firefighting](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/DOD_mobile_aircraft_firefighting_training_device.jpg): it's a profession made up of [over 70% volunteers](http://www.ehow.com/about_5412324_fun-firefighters-gear.html)

This sub is especially dear to me because my boyfriend is a volunteer firefighter

Being a firefighter is simultaneously one of the [most demanding](http://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/firefighter-conference.jpg), those who *do* love it [really love it](http://firecritic.com/files/2012/01/firefighter-love-Motivational-or-Demotivational-Firefighting-EMS-Poster.jpg) and can been seen at their stations whenever they aren't at their other jobs, waiting for the next call to come in. You'd be hard pressed to find a group of more [dedicated people](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_GHbJ9C1Cw10/TJen54cFMtI/AAAAAAAAAAw/RR42ffqCyjY/s1600/FirefighterBrotherhood.jpg) or with such a familial closeness. 

/r/Firefighting is filled with such [awesome people](http://i.imgur.com/wGz0T.png), with most getting just 1 or 2 comments, but whenever [a newbie joins the community and asks for help](http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1a365e/im_applying_for_volunteer_membership_at_a_local/), they're sure to get an enthusiastic and informative response. You'll even find domestic and [foreign firefighters](http://i.imgur.com/YNUakI3.jpg) sharing pictures of their trucks, engines, and stations. 

Today we have *both* of the /r/firefighting mods and two real-life firefighters


&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/Firefighting? 

&gt;&gt;**zjp_716** Defer to halligan00 who started it. I joined as a Mod to help out.

&gt;&gt;**halligan00** Partly to replace a defunct forum site that was active in our area

&gt;2.Are any of you career or volunteer firefighters? 

&gt;&gt;**zjp_716** I am a volunteer firefighter outside of Buffalo

&gt;&gt;**halligan00** Career Captain in the District of Columbia

&gt;3.What got you interested in firefighting? 

&gt;&gt;**zjp_716** for me it started off like many young boys dream of being a fireman, I didn't have a lot of friends. For a while, again like many teens I was looking to belong to something that was bigger than me. When I joined the FD I found that. I found a room full of guys who would later become some of my best friends.

&gt;&gt;**halligan00** Originally

&gt;4.Tell me about your most memorable call.

&gt;&gt;**zjp_716** Not one call

&gt;&gt;**halligan00** September 11, getting snippets of news and rumours from the military officers in the courtyard of the Pentagon. Coming out of a fire and having a Major take my airpack, a LTC hand me a towel, and a Col hand me a bottle of water. The military had broken into all of their soda machines, poured out the soda, and filled them with water - to this day, if I taste a few drops of pepsi in water

&gt;5.Any funny stories to share from your academy? 

&gt;&gt;**zjp_716** Nothing too funny- mainly serious business, but it made for a great clip.

&gt;&gt;**halligan00** Standing in line with 30 sweaty men to use 2 showers. MPD recruits came running through our academy and waved their class flag from the top of our tower -- we stretched lines and 'treed' them with hose streams. Great friends. Running. Lots of running. Making fun of our Lieutenant behind his back.

&gt;6.Do you have any tips for any aspiring firefighters?

&gt;&gt;**zjp_716** weather its a paying job or volunteer vocation A) we're all professional. We all do they same job- protecting the public, we just expect you to be respectful of the past, be mindful of your status in the community, and treat your other firefighters and most importantly the public with respect.

&gt;&gt;**halligan00** Volunteer. To make a career at it: Become a paramedic. Apply everywhere. If you're young, find a way to excuse yourself, and take no part in it.

&gt;7.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers? 

&gt;&gt;**zjp_716** THANK YOU! the subscribers of this subreddit are awesome. We've had our tactic debates, and work in different parts of the world. It shows how we adapt to anything. The way we do things is different from the way others do things - it's not one way is right and the other is wrong, its just what works for us. I think our subscribers bring out the best in everyone all the time. Guys are always complimenting others truck, equipment, and stations, all while taking a chance to bust each others balls which makes this seem like a really big virtual firehouse.

&gt;&gt;I love checking everyday for new insightful things- this is truly a team sport and the more players we have help contribute to everyones well being.

&gt;&gt;Our patch trade was cool

&gt;&gt;**halligan00** Carry On.

Not gonna lie, talked to the mods, and BAM, its Subreddit Of The Day. I like to play it fast and loose like that. ~~Unfortunately so did my wife, thus the divorce. Happy thanksgiving everyone. */SOB*~~ **UNCLEVER JOKE.** 

Anyway, its good. Like shitty good. Its the pics version of /r/badmovies. As always its related to the Safe For Work Porn Network™. I wonder if they got the shitty subreddits under a similar umbrella would they call it Scat Porn Network? Oh man, I'm silly. But don't judge this book (subreddit) by its cover (Horrendous CSS layout, its supposed to be a spoof of /r/EarthPorn). 

You guys really need to give this sub a chance. ~~You'll be surprised what diamond in the shit can you can find.~~ **NOPE.** I can not say that with a straight face. I WILL NOT. I rather pluck my eyes out then give that subreddit a positive spin. No

Other times we all need a dose of reality. /r/MorbidReality is all fun and great

&gt;# 1 What makes some pics suitable to be considered shitty?

This one of  [**San Francisco**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyEarthPorn/comments/sot20/picture_i_took_of_san_francisco_from_the_golden/) is also one of my favorites.

&gt;# 3 How shitty should my cellphone camera be to take pics for ShittyEarthPorn?

&gt;&gt;**KjonesLOL** That's the best part, just point your camera about 40 degrees to your right and [**capture that ugly sign**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyEarthPorn/comments/11u3lq/breathtaking_landscape_by_my_aspiring/) to complete the shot. Other tips include [**angling the camera up or down**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyEarthPorn/comments/12a8oc/what_a_beautiful_day_to_have_a_small_campfire/) to almost miss the shot entirely, [**manipulate focus**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyEarthPorn/comments/12l5tr/spider_web_in_virgin_forest_972_648/) to ruin their shot, or [**simply resizing**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyEarthPorn/comments/12jhaj/beautiful_view_this_morning_in_missoula_montana/) the shot if you can't make it shitty any other way.

&gt;# 4 If I keep repeating the word shitty will it make me &amp; this subreddit funny?

&gt;&gt;**KjonesLOL** No.

&gt;&gt;**SaltyChristian** Yes

&gt;&gt;**GodofAtheism** Nothing can make this subreddit funny

&gt;# 5 Tell us about your shitty community and subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**KjonesLOL** First we made **/r/EarthPorn** and it was good. That was a problem. So we made **/r/ShittyEarthPorn** and now it's terrible. We're very happy with the results.

&gt;&gt;**SaltyChristian** It's a shitty community and subreddit. Need I say more?

&gt;&gt;**GodofAtheism** What the fuck did you just fucking say about ShittyEarthPorn

&gt;&gt; I’ll have you know we're widely regarded as the most respectable of all the communities on Reddit, mark my fucking words.

&gt;&gt; You think you can get away with saying that shit about ShittyEarthPorn over the Internet? Think again

Not only are we extensively trained in trolling, but we have access to the entire admin team at Reddit and we will use our full list of contacts to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the internet, you little Instagram wannabe.

&gt;&gt; If only you could have known what unholy retribution your “clever” little comment was about to bring down upon you

&gt;&gt; But you couldn’t, you goddamn artist. ShittyEarthPorn will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking shadowbenned, kiddo.

That's right folks

This sub was inspired by a very popular /r/AskReddit [thread yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/m4EYG.jpg)

&gt;I have this theory that if I just keep talking to people

&gt;So far

At the urging of his peers, entitled ""2012-No."" Perhaps it was the combination of JewBoy's name, subreddit title, and post title that intrigued readers of /r/all, for soon after that post, the sub simply EXPLODED and ""2012- No"" ended up in the top 100 of /r/all.

Which brings us to today: r/IsJewBoyMarriedYet has blossomed into a supportive dating advice/story sub for young JewBoy (real name ""Adam Sandler""). [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IsJewBoyMarriedYet/comments/13ocrw/about_me/) he shares a bit more about his life to his subscribers who have been begging for more

/u/Freakazette commented that ""It's like How I Met Your Mother

I guess you could say that Adam has become a bit of a Reddit celebrity considering [he's already got fans writing him slightly creepy but mostly cute letters](http://www.reddit.com/r/IsJewBoyMarriedYet/comments/13r0sj/i_was_your_first_fan_i_am_your_biggest_fan/) and people posting [pictures of him](http://www.reddit.com/r/IsJewBoyMarriedYet/comments/13r1vb/a_better_representation_of_adam/). Hell, going to so far as to [Omegle](http://www.reddit.com/r/IsJewBoyMarriedYet/comments/13og88/ill_be_on_omegle_video_chat_type_in_ijbmy_as_an/) with them. 

So ladies of a certain age (18 or below... Adam's only 16 and you shouldn't go to jail for the sake of love/internet celebrity!): if Adam/JewBoy sounds like your kinda guy OR you're [Anne Hathaway](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/AnneHathawayJan10.jpg/220px-AnneHathawayJan10.jpg)

Here to tell us more about his love life and his incredibly fast-growing sub is THE /u/JewBoySandler! Let's give him a [warm welcome](http://images.wikia.com/glee/images/archive/9/9d/20111111195504!Applause.gif)

&gt;2.Is your name really Adam Sandler?

&gt;&gt;Yes

&gt;3.How has the dating world been treating you so far?

&gt;&gt;The dating world... not so good. The last date I went on went great! She was happy

A subreddit of **593 readers** for **1 month!**

Procrastination is not a positive word. Very rarely would anyone use it as a complimentary fashion; ""Great procrastination today, or to float lazily on the televisual ocean, is usually seen as being at best not good. It's hard to disagree with this. Many the time I have gone so far as to log on to reddit to do something specific like, say, write up a /r/subredditoftheday post, only to balk at the first hurdle and veer off into some completely unrelated and unproductive thread, and thereby procrastinate the very procrastination I planned to procrastinate in the first place! Feelsbadman.jpg. 

But that's a problem for a different subreddit, before incestuous constructs like our own beloved /r/SubredditOfTheDay and /r/TheoryOfReddit allowed reddit to dissect and feed upon itself with little input from the outside interworld. It gathers together all the one-shot wonders of the net in one handy and easily accessible format, and tbh I have personally been waiting for something like this for a long time.

&gt;&gt; I have compulsive bookmarking disorder. Over the years I think I've managed to accumulate over 2000 bookmarks of random websites that are of the exact description you see on the subreddit's sidebar; unique and single purpose. It recently occurred to me that I have to back these things up. Plaintext not being my aura

**750 lovers of small communities for 1 year!**

/r/obscuresubreddits takes the challenge of locating these diamonds in the rough, it has resisted growth, unlike the more popular /r/newreddits and even /r/NotSoNewReddits. 

As mentioned in the sidebar, you can find literally anything that anyone has ever given a shit about. Its easy to stay on the surface and swim with the defaults and never want for interesting posts, however once you venture down the rabbit hole you might be surprised at what you find. 

For example: /r/piecharts. I love pie charts. I love to look at them and glean myriad tidbits of information from them. Who knew there was an entire subreddit dedicated to their informative existance? And /r/timelapse. Who doesn't like watching cool videos of slow sequences sped up immensely

I spoke with the mod team to gauge their obscurity:

&gt;How do you define ""Obscure Subreddit?"" Do you remove submissions that don't comply with your sidebar?

&gt;&gt;**Zberblank:** An obscure subreddit can be anything from a community for a niche topic to a subreddit for a band with a low subscriber count. While it is a bit of a broad definition, be at least 3 months old, and have at least 3 submissions. Any submission that breaks these rules gets removed.

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark (subreddit creator):** It's tough to define

&gt;&gt;A subreddit should also be old enough to be obscure, same philosophy. We really just want to help subreddits get exposure.

&gt;What's your process for locating an obscure subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Zberblank:** I personally have several methods for finding an obscure subreddit. One is that I type in phrases, so there are a lot to choose from.

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** I usually find them in the course of browsing reddit

&gt;What kinds of things do you get in your modmail?

&gt;&gt;**Zberblank:** This is actually our first modmail. Congratulations!

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** We've been too obscure to get modmail - it was a shock to see your message there.

&gt;Offtopic question: Star Wars: Episode 7 or Iron Man 3?

&gt;&gt;**Zberblank:** Star Wars 7. Iron Man suuuuucks.

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** Star Wars for sure - the actors are getting up there in years

&gt;What are your top 5 obscure subreddits?

&gt;&gt;**Zberblank:** That's tough

&gt;&gt; 1. /r/althistory 
&gt;&gt; 2. /r/albumaday
&gt;&gt; 3. /r/ShittyAlbumArtPorn   
&gt;&gt; 4. /r/gonepotato for it's sheer ridiculousness 
&gt;&gt; 5. /r/badgers

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** 

&gt;&gt; 1. /r/BobbinLace - for a lace-making technique that itself is pretty obscure. It has an impressive sidebar
&gt;&gt; 2. /r/screamingfish - one of those one-off subreddits that everybody should visit at least once
&gt;&gt; 3. /r/privatestudyrooms - the very niche subreddits appeal to me
&gt;&gt; 4. /r/Cetacea - the mod does something like 95% of the posting there
&gt;&gt; 5. /r/homebuilt - this one is active

&gt;Anything to say to your subscribers?

Ever dreamed of becoming a Hero? Of having you name shouted far and wide? Maybe Fame is not your goal and instead it’s Gold that you seek. You long to plunder and horde

If one of these is your dream then I'm sorry to have to tell you that you won’t be getting your wish (or a girlfriend) any time soon. But wait! Not all hope is lost! (well maybe the girlfriend hope) Maybe you've heard about it or maybe you have no idea what it is so allow me to tell you of the great game that is Dungeons &amp; Dragons! [Insert Assorted Fanfare Music!]

Dungeons &amp; Dragons is an RPG (Role-playing Game) from which many popular video games such as World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls were based off. But this is no game for a console

In the world of D&amp;D you do not ask “Why?” you ask “Why not?”. “Why not look for a back door to the Evil Wizard fortress?”

By this stage you should be absolutely dying to start playing and if you’re not well then you might as well keep reading as by this stage we both know [you've nothing better to do.](http://www.qwitr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/to-do-list-nothing.jpg) Getting started is pretty easy

I've been at D&amp;D for over a year or two and have always thoroughly enjoyed each session thanks to our great DM and insane party members, the female Elf ranger has failed on multiple occasions to ""sell herself"" (yes she is played by a girl) whereas the Paladin has done it so many times I'm pretty sure his own God is questioning revoking his powers and my Sorcerer has personally sold a Goblin into slavery for a nice new staff. For a party of Good alignment I often wonder how true that is as we once decided there wasn't enough Kolbold Eunuchs in the world and proceeded to make one more out of a ""friend"" we had released from a cell earlier.

Apart from being God's among men we also happen to have a few special skills. An Australian Rogue who is [immune to even the strongest types of Alcohol

Our meetups have greatly reduced in number due to people going off to Uni and whatnot but /r/DnD have introduced us with many ways to continue our adventures. It's full of super helpful guides and tips to get you started and loads of ideas to spice up your campaign.  But don’t just take it from me

&gt;##1.What is Dungeons &amp; Dragons? And what does it mean to you?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a role-playing game that essentially boils down to cooperative storytelling between a group of people. One person (the dungeon master or DM) is the narrator responsible for creating and describing the world in which the players live. Each player controls a character and together they go forth into the world on adventures in which every decision they make affects the story being told by the group. For me

&gt;##2. What did you hope to achieve when you first made this Subreddit?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** When I first made this subreddit, but people started trickling in and it grew into a place where new and experienced players and DM's gather to swap stories and ideas, ask questions about rules, and all other things related to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

&gt;##3. Can you provide a simple explanation/breakdown of the various editions?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** 

&gt;&gt;**Simple:** You can think of each edition as a revision/update of the previous ones. Generally speaking, and many people play multiple editions.

&gt;&gt;**Not Simple:** The original game Dungeons &amp; Dragons was published in 1974

&gt;&gt;In 1989, Dungeons &amp; Dragons was mostly in a fantasy setting (think Lord of the Rings), but with AD&amp;D 2nd Ed. came new ""themes"" to adventure in. You could now have adventures in a world of Gothic horror (Ravenloft setting), or wander in apocalyptic wastelands (Dark Sun) or even play on ships travelling through outer space (Spelljammer).

&gt;&gt;3rd Edition was released in 2000

&gt;&gt;4th Edition was released in 2008 and is essentially a streamlined form of D&amp;D that has been simplified in many respects. This new edition was much easier to learn

&gt;##4. Who can play Dungeons &amp; Dragons?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** Everyone! I was introduced by my cousin and started playing when I was 7. I introduced my friends to D&amp;D during high-school and I introduced several university students to the game last year. All it takes to get started is a group of friends

&gt;##5. What makes it so damn appealing?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** I think the appeal of D&amp;D is that it's a great excuse to get together with your friends for a few hours, whatever you want! Plus you get to fight dragons.

&gt;##6. Would you mind sharing your favourite memory of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons session?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** I'm particularly fond of a character I used to play who wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. He had the unfortunate combination of an insatiable curiosity and need to investigate coupled with the tendency to put things in his mouth. He ended up drinking something he shouldn't have and died a painful

&gt;##7. Who has been your favourite character to play?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** An elven wizard with great power who had grown up in human society and despite his magical abilities was unfortunately bullied by the village he grew up in. Consequently he suffered from crippling social anxiety and could only cast spells when he thought people weren't watching

&gt;##8. Total number of: Dungeons Cleared? Dragons Slayed?
&gt;&gt;**pistolwhip** Dungeons cleared is too high to count

Hope you enjoyed my write-up and now have a burning desire to play and if not could I just direct your attention [over here....](http://i.imgur.com/arvim.gif)

I can never remember a time when I didn't procrastinate on things. 

It's a side of me I hate and am actively trying to change

The worst part is that beyond the self-inflicted onset stress and shame that so often accompanies procrastination

Tonight, I told myself I would work on my SROTD write-up when I got home from my friends house. 

Little did I know that fate had decided getting back to my computer from said friends house at a decent hour of the night was not in my foreseeable future

The long and short of the story is that I, placating with my manager, trying to explain why it is important to me that I take some time this morning at work and sit in the lobby, use the wi-fi when I should be working and talk to my internet friends about my life and a cool website I found. 

In an even more bizarre twist of sick sadistic fate
and my first thought when I woke up was a frantic realization that I had not finished my SROTD write-up. You see where my priorities lie? :P

But

You have to face it

You have to put in the effort

People over at [/r/buildapc](/r/buildapc) understand that. They know that delayed satisfaction

For anyone who has wanted to throw aside the pre-built, [/r/buildapc](/r/buildapc) exists as a niche community that gives people a look into the world of small time PC builds. 

Coupled with [/r/buildapcsales](/r/buildapcsales)

One adverse side effect to the subreddit is the hardware envy that undoubtedly will crop up at some point (always a bigger fish amirite?). It takes some cash to invest in a PC build if you want to just start from scratch

Just today on the frontpage there is a excellent discussion on how a guy should properly spend an allotted $12, mind you me. 

Thanks for joining me this morning and thanks as always for reading. You guys are literally the reason I drag myself out of bed some mornings.

We've all been there before: stuck in a shitty situation (heh) without a clever way out or at the end of our rope when it comes to an everyday annoyance with no obvious solution. That's where /r/ShittyLifeProTips can come in! 

* Going camping and looking for a some ambient tent light? [Try lighting a small fire in the middle of the tent](http://i.imgur.com/ibF1Y.jpg)! 

* Cat shit on your carpet? No problem! [Cut the carpet up and throw both the shit and the carpet square away to avoid touching poop](http://i.imgur.com/SCiU0.jpg)!

* Too poor to go to the movies but you still want the dark theater experience? [Try taping your phone to the inside of a box and wearing said box on your face](http://i.imgur.com/N8AGB.jpg).

There's something to be said for parody subs, they cut right to the what makes their targets so ridiculous and make you laugh at the absurdity of it all, and the good people of /r/ShittyLifeProTips do just that. 

For such a young subreddit, /r/shittyaskscience, and r/shittyseduction. But don't take it from me, take it from this sub's fine mods, /u/Sithishade and /u/PotatoMusicBinge!


&gt;##1. What inspired you to create this subreddit?
&gt;&gt;**Sithishade** Well, it was one of the funniest ideas I'd heard of in awhile. Parody has always been one of my favorite forms of comedy, and so I was delighted to be a part of the subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**PotatoMusicBinge** As a founding member of /r/shittyhub I get the inside track on all the shittiest new subs. /r/ShittyLifeProTips stuck out as being particularly hilarious so I begged the other mods to let me play. They are all much better at modding than me



&gt;##2. Ever get any complaints from people who didn't realize it was satire?
&gt;&gt;**Sithishade** As far as I remember, I added a disclaimer to the sidebar informing users that the subreddit was a parody just to be safe. You just never know.

&gt;&gt;**PotatoMusicBinge** No

&gt;##3. Do any of you also subscribe to r/ProLifeTips? If so
&gt;&gt;**Sithishade** I do subscribe to /r/LifeProTips

&gt;&gt;**PotatoMusicBinge** I did for a while

&gt;##4. What's the best/funniest shitty tip you've seen on here?
&gt;&gt;**Sithishade** I think my two favorites are [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/s76cj/) and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/qo874/). They're obviously not tips from pros (or are they?) but they've got the same attitude many successful /r/LifeProTips posts have: matter-of-fact and/or eager-to-please.

&gt;&gt;**PotatoMusicBinge** God. How could anyone choose!? Just off the top of my head: [Instead of wasting money on a leash

&gt;##5. Any shitty tips you'd like to share with our readers?
&gt;&gt;**Sithishade** If you're interested in more satire, neither list is complete. If you've got a great idea for a shitty subreddit, make one and let us know if it's an up-and-comer.

&gt;&gt;**PotatoMusicBinge** Hmmmm

&gt;##6. Anything you'd like to say to your shitty tippers?
&gt;&gt;**Sithishade** You guys are hilarious

&gt;&gt;**PotatoMusicBinge** /r/ShittyLifeProTips has just enough witty subscribers to be both active and fresh, hippie, you're the best!

**No subscribers** for **4 years!**

I don’t know, I checked it out and I decided…

I have to break as many rules as I possibly can here, has overridden RES.  “Use subreddit style?  Yes.”  There is absolutely no getting around it.

[/r/___](http://www.reddit.com/r/___/comments/dhlrb/congratulations_guys_you_broke_reddit/) once broke Reddit.  You will never actually know whether or not you have any new messages as the envelope perma-mocks you as orange-red

And yet everyone loves their power-mad dictator /u/p337.  There is a ~~suspiciously empty~~ [complaint thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/___/comments/dkzuf/r_complaint_thread_a_chance_to_voice_your_opinion/) for airing your grieveances.  He did make an updated one a few months ago

Oh, it came up that LGBTerrific and I could arm-wrestle on unicycles to decide who could feature this subreddit.  Well, I won anyway because I not only called dibs, I licked the mod mail, which all dibs lawyers know is the untrumpable super-dibs.  But we decided that the unicycle battle royale was still on the table, with the potential of selling tickets for the worthy cause of stocking the SROTD fridge.  To quote the great me, “Pizza rolls and Pepsi don’t buy themselves.”  Words to live by.

I haven’t broken enough rules.  I mean, I’ve only broken four or five rules.  I need to do something more.

Oh, it’s not officially against the rule to interview the mod or anything, but it does make him a contributory accessory to my crimes or something, which would make me the most epic rule breaker of all time.  **In my own mind.**  But, also, it gives a chance to look into the world of a man who can do absolutely no wrong.

&gt;#1. What is it like being all powerful?  I mean

&gt;&gt;**p337** Having the power of CSS is pretty good. There are a few limitations in reddit that frustrate me, but not impossible. People can still disable subreddit styles, but we should all feel sorry for those people.

&gt;#2. You have made two complaint threads and they are empty.  What is it like being perfect?

&gt;&gt;**p337** I feel like the complaint threads are a waste of space. I make them as a sign of good faith. People are of course free to criticize /r/___, so no one complains. It is sometimes frustrating to not make mistakes, because you never really know what to improve on.

&gt;#3. How do you feel about the fact that there’s so many rule breakers in your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**p337** I feel disappointed. It is my hope that the bubble will soon burst

&gt;#4. Your subreddit once broke Reddit.  Congratulations.  How did that make you feel?

&gt;&gt;**p337** It was a pretty big ""I told you so"" moment. I warned against posting/subscribing. I tried to protect reddit from this subreddit

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**p337** Sure. I was pretty disappointed with people's reaction to the [bot](http://www.reddit.com/user/ThreeUnderscores) I wrote. I feel like people simply wanted to get a high score... but he is so much smarter than that. Just as /r/___ was corrupted, people of /r/subredditoftheday , please do not take this as an advertisement for /r/___, but rather a look into a curious place. A glimpse of a distant dying star.

Just kidding on the medieval serf thing.  I'm not that creative.

Have you ever sat there and thought “I wish that there was a subreddit that combined /r/explainlikeimfive with /r/IAmA?”  Probably not, but it’s a nice community with a friendly mod team.

In /r/explainlikeIAmA

By the way

I sat down with the mods to find out what makes /r/explainlikeIAmA so awesome.

&gt;#1. What was the inspiration for this subreddit and/or why did you want to be a part of it?

&gt;&gt;**Herecomethedrums** Our mod overlord Jonnybegood created it so we would different and have more interesting posts than explainlikeim5. The subreddit was dead for a few months until we started posting again and got a few thousand more subscribers.

&gt;&gt;**benzrf** I wanted to be a part of it because I wasn't doing much at the moment and noticed that /r/explainlikeIAmA had a regrettable lack of CSS.

&gt;&gt;**nr1988** I can't really speak for the inspiration, and was rewarded with modership.

&gt;&gt;**explains_as_chaucer** I was bored with the front page images and looking for something a little different. I stumbled across the question ""Explain the opera neutrino results like I am from the Middle Ages"". I thought to myself

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy** I liked the concept of it and felt that even though /r/explanlikeimfive is a great subreddit

&gt;&gt;**caulfield45** After a couple decent posts in /r/shittyaskscience I was brought in here. I'd like to think it was my post likening the existence of doorknobs to a grim future without fossil fuels (no

&gt;&gt;**jonnybegood** G g gggg gg- sorry

&gt;&gt;[The OP inspiration were these back and forth comments: ""Explain it like I'm 5"" ""Now explain like I'm a stripper"" ""Now like a 19th century carnival barker"" ""Now as if you were Hans Gruber and I was John McClaine during the middle of the film Die Hard.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/mrbzs/wikipedia_it_appears_that_we_were_actually_taken/c33906q)

&gt;&gt;Those explanation riffs regularly occur in /r/explainlikeimfive comments and [have lead to too many spinoff 1-off explanation subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/search?q=explain+like). I wanted to create a haven subreddit for all the possibilities out there

&gt;&gt;I continue because the one thing better than drunk redditting is drunk modding. And /r/explainlikeiama has creativity, community de doy blah blah blah.

&gt;&gt;TL;DR We're the Walmart of explanation subreddits. Except not corporate evil

&gt;#2. What do you expect from your community?

&gt;&gt;**Herecomethedrums** I expect them to read the sidebar and follow the rules. Any rule breakers get embarrassing flair attached to their username.

&gt;&gt;**benzrf** I expect people to give answers that are in-character and hopefully unique to the question.

&gt;&gt;**nr1988** I expect them to really add something, just follow the Guinness, and don't post anything against reddiquette!

&gt;&gt;**explains_as_chaucer** I EXPECT YOU TO ENTERTAIN ME! DANCE MONKEYS

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy** Provide good detailed answers to even the most strangest posts.

&gt;&gt;**caulfield45** Some of it you'd have to see to believe, we've had the concept of torrent downloading explained by an actual honest-to-goodness pirate (or at least they played the character that good). Honestly, I've come to expect some great answers from people who go a superb job nailing the character.

&gt;&gt;**jonnybegood** I expect we will forever get explanations starring Hitler, Snoop, Jesus and all the other reddit regulars. I expect that peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars.

&gt;&gt;I expect that as we grow

&gt;#3. Do you have any favorite submissions?  What was your favorite answer for it?

&gt;&gt;**Herecomethedrums** my favorite would have to be any interesting and not random people whoring for comment karma. I don't really have a favorite post

&gt;&gt;**benzrf** I'm not sure. There have certainly been a lot of extremely clever questions. For answers

&gt;&gt;**nr1988** I can't think of any one submission off hand, with some spicing up by considering the situation and reaction that the ""asker"" would have. There are plenty of great ones that don't follow all of this, but I love the perfect storm of when it all falls into place like that.

&gt;&gt;**explains_as_chaucer** There are a few classics that are laugh out loud

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy** [yes](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/16hd92/explain_tentacle_porn_like_im_pope_benedict_xvi/c7w3pjr).

&gt;&gt;**caulfield45** There was the one guy who told Beethoven what woodchippers were. My favorite thread of all, where everyone assumed their username and explained /r/explainlikeiama. Naturally, hilarity ensued.

&gt;&gt;**jonnybegood** [My favorite combination request: Furries as Cicero](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/14g1ya/explain_furries_like_im_cicero/) and [my favorite answer: CoD 12 y/o talks Canadian Politics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/rftkn/explain_current_canadian_politics_to_me_like_iama/c45sxo7)

&gt;&gt;For the ELIAMA connoisseur: My favorite reward flair

&gt;&gt;My 2nd favorite flair o' shame

&gt;&gt;Reward flair is given through random Moddess-favored explanations. Flair o' Shame is mercilessly struck down on the unrepentant derp for transgressions beyond imagining.

&gt;#4. Explain /r/explainlikeIAmA like I am you at age five.

&gt;&gt;**Herecomethedrums** *Come with me… and you’ll be… in a world of pure procrastinationnn!*

&gt;&gt;**nr1988** So

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy** A subreddit for everyone but you…

&gt;&gt;**caulfield45** You know how you got your arm stuck in that metal folding chair back at that church youth event last month? And the firemen showed up to cut you out of it with the Jaws of Life because your arm was turning black and blue? Well, but it comes with a TV screen.

&gt;&gt;Now imagine that nice doctor man decided to visit a website that didn't exist in 1990 called Reddit, and when you get older and Al Gore invents the internet for us, you can look at pictures of naked people and play pretend too!

&gt;&gt;Oh, RUN!

&gt;&gt;**explains_as_chaucer** Ok little explains_as_chaucer, let’s just say there's another time and place where every man and woman carries a quill, and can wield it with some little skill. Now picture also a great public room with wandering travellers from far off lands. They write silly questions on a wall covered with empty parchments, for nothing other than to amuse their fellows; whereupon others will furnish further entertainment by answering those questions.

&gt;&gt;You are thinking ""But questions and answers? That's so boring"". You are correct, a particular culture has developed around this ritual where the travellers will ask their questio with a twis- a new point of view. For example, eating bread is boring but not if you ask for the point of view of the bread. That morning loaf you had this morning was boring for you, but for the bread... just think of the nightmare that poor slice went through, with giant blades, gnashing white rock monsters and dark snake dragging it into a pit of acid!

&gt;&gt;**jonnybegood** Oh, one proposes a query desiring explanation as so: ""Explain [something (a)] like IamA/YouAreA [something (b)]. The (a) and (b) are left at the whim of the petitioner, chosen perhaps for comedic value or clarion comprehension, for example. Whatever the purpose, there are virtually no limitations (there used to be no limitations, but alas, you and I underestimated the depths of the abyss of laziness and wrath to which our fellow man will fall).

&gt;&gt;The proposal waits for its answer, guarded only by harmony and understanding sympathy and trust abounding has lead to no more falsehoods or derision, only golden living dreams of visions mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation.*

&gt;&gt;*Note: I was into some crazy shit when I was 5. Age 6

&gt;&gt;ps Before I go, I absolutely must do an homage to one of my all time favorite reddit-aided discoveries.[ I do hope you'll forgive me, though I know you won't...](http://i.imgur.com/N15FW.jpg)

Welcome friends and family to NSFW week at Subreddit of the Day!  This is our second week of celebrating our one year anniversary as a reddit community, undoing the top button of our cargo shorts and shining a light on the salacious, the lascivious, the libidinous corners of reddit dot com!!

Kicking off this week is the greatest and the largest NSFW subreddit of them all.  Gonewild offers a place where women and men can post pics of their sexiness, lemmie tell you!  For those of us who feel restricted by redundant clothing, for the exhibitionist who has no immediate audience, for all the fans who require regular release of endorphins and the neurohormone dopamine by lookin' at boobs, gonewild is there for you.  It's there for us all!

But Johnny, and I couldn't get anything done...  Then yes, that might be too much and I'd start getting critical.  But in my neighbourhood?  I don't see nearly enough tits!  Next time you post your, ""karma whore"" comment, please include your address so that I might dig you out from beneath that avalanche of pussy.

I love gonewild.  I don't wan't to see [family members](http://christwire.org/2012/01/has-your-daughter-or-wife-been-caught-into-reddits-gonewild-imgur-trafficking-underworld/) there mind you... but I do love that place so!

Of course

/r/FitMeals is a community that sprouted from the loins of /r/fitness 2 years ago, and BOY do [their foods looks delicious](http://i.imgur.com/TySc1bG.jpg)! 

This sub is home to countless [awesome](http://imgur.com/a/m7TOd) and [inspirational submissions](http://i.imgur.com/CkpV1Pi.jpg) that you'll find while browsing their archives and top posts. If you love something and want to try a healthier version of it

I guess you could say that /r/FitMeals is the hero [the world needs](http://fatnews.com/images/global_obesity_men.jpg), duh. Where else did think this Dark Knight quote was going?

Anywho

&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/fitmeals?

&gt;&gt;**vespera23** I was about 30 pounds heavier than I am now, as did the cooking subreddits, but no forum was dedicated to cheap, healthy food. I pitched the idea to /r/fitness and got a big response.

&gt;&gt;**acconrad** didnt create it

&gt;2.How important is fitness in your daily lives? What kinds of programs or exercises do you guys follow?

&gt;&gt;**vespera23** When I created the community I was in ""reshaping"" mode, and watch my intake most of the time.

&gt;&gt;**acconrad** super important. i do 5/3/1 workout with lean gains diet

&gt;3.What's your favorite fit recipe?

&gt;&gt;**vespera23** Before I became a vegetarian, but substituting Seitan or tofu. Simple = Staple

&gt;&gt;**acconrad** silverhydra chili

&gt;4.Any advice for someone wanting to clean up their diet?

&gt;&gt;**vespera23** Start simple. Following a complex carb cycling diet is very hard to maintain short term, or substituting healthy versions of your existing staples is better for the long run. If you're a nerd for metrics like I am, apps like myfitnesspal can help you keep track of what you take in as well.

&gt;&gt;**acconrad** if the earth made that food

&gt;5.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**vespera23** THANKS! I had really thought this was going to be a tiny subreddit when I put it up

&gt;&gt;**acconrad** i love you!

I want to start off with this crucial advice folks. No man, and that line is to phyiscally hurt your Significant Others' gentials. (Unless they were into that, but thats a different topic and subreddit) I'm trying to find the post the above comment was related to but for the life of me, I just can't anymore. And for some reason, that actually is giving me some peace of mind.

How does a magazine like Cosmopolitan even get away with half the stuff it publishes? Furthermore how are these writers of such ""articles / sex tips"" not sued for their crazy ideas? I mean, I gotta try it on my boyfriend"". And how much have they racked up in hospital bills? You know because of all genital mutilation and such.

I want to continue making fun of this ""magazine"" but its comes off as just plain mean. Its like bullying the kid with Down Syndrome. There are no real winners. Ladies... and gay guys who still don't understand what men what

One final thing I want to say before I go



&gt;#1. How did you get involved with r/SCS?

&gt;&gt;**/u/hvisla** As soon as I discovered the sub I immediately fell in love and started posting a ton. Was subsequently made a mod for all my activity.

&gt;&gt;**/u/leeceia** It was my little brain child. I love love love magazines and it's a family tradition that when it's a family holiday my aunt/mum/cousins/sisters all buy celebrity magazines like Hello and mock them. And I love mocking cosmo

&gt;&gt;Yeah


&gt;#2. What is your favorite post so far?

&gt;&gt;**hvisla** [Perfection]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitCosmoSays/comments/18u96x/though_i_should_do_my_part_to_help_cosmo_so_i/)

&gt;&gt;**leeceia** This one was probably the [**most hilariously bad.**](http://i.imgur.com/s7EFenu.jpg)

&gt;#3. What post do you fear your SO will actually try on you?

&gt;&gt;**hvisla** There are actually several we've done that I thought were totally normal until I saw them in this sub

&gt;&gt;**leeceia** I have actually tried some things on my boyfriend. He's not always happy about it. There were teeth involved - incredibly gently (no hospital visits I swear!! Not even any blood!). He gets a little jumpy when I turn round and say ""Hey babe

&gt;#4. Got a funny / scary story regarding your sexlife you're willing to share?

&gt;&gt;**hvisla** Sure. **TMI/NSFW** obviously: Was on top of my boyfriend

&gt;&gt;**leeceia** Well there was a time once at the beginning of my relationship where my boyfriend loved to say, it was pretty much his catch phrase. And so I kinda adopted it for a little. We'd say it to each other over everything, making coffee, getting on the train. One day we were having sex, but there were people at home so we had to be quiet. I was on top, and it was getting kinda intense. He whispered to me ""I'm getting real close, I'm going to cum"". I looked deep into his soul and whispered back softly, ""Do it brah"". We started laughing so hard I fell off the bed. He doesn't say that anymore. 
 
&gt;#5. Tell us about your community

&gt;&gt;**hvisla** We all bond over horrible sex tips. It's great.

&gt;&gt;**leeceia** Our community is fantastic. Quite frankly the sub isn't something people can always easily submit to, and you do get horror stories which is always funny in reflection.

&gt;&gt;Our mods are also amazing. Just last month I had /u/tg989 completely out of the blue offer us a new banner and worked to bring in the fantastic CSS we now have. /u/hvisla and /u/FormicaArchonis are always contributing brilliant stuff and are really funny. Makes it a pleasure to run.

Riddles are great for your [procrastination](http://www.reddit.com) and good for training your brain. Got some spare time? Solve a riddle. Want something challenging? Solve a riddle. Drowning a brown bear/bringing some friends to the waterpool? (Ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg) Solve a riddle.

I'm not really good at solving riddles, but that only makes it worth the effort. Atleast, that's what you say to yourself. 

There has only been one riddle I have ever solved on my own
&gt; An old man with a lot of money and two sons dies. In the fathers testament, but they realise they can never finish it, because they keep holding their horses back. Therefore they go to a wise man and ask him what they should do. Later on the brothers race, going at full speed. What did the wise man tell them?

**The answer is below the interview**

But in many cases the person who told you the riddle won't even tell you the answer. How cruel can someone be? It's like having control of letting you sneeze or not. I don't know why they would do that

But at /r/riddles it's not even neccesairy to get the answer from the OP, saying ""Oohhh.""

/r/riddles is an amazing subreddit which can give you much fun

Let's continue this tour with the next stop: the interview. And I didn't have an interview with just some guy in the world. I had an informative talk with /u/someguyinworld. (Couldn't resist)

#More answers hopefully getting soon

&gt;#1.How did this subreddit got created?
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** You'd have to ask /u/diligentdogs about how the subreddit was created

&gt;#2.What do you love about riddles?
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** Personally, though, is when you spend 5 minutes trying to figure out a tough riddle, give up, scroll down, hover over the top comment, and smack yourself in the head, ""ohh

&gt;&gt;I also think that having a riddle community improves the traditional riddle experience. Rather than your friend telling you a riddle and you trying to solve it, and, if the OP hasn't replied yet, discuss whether or not it's the answer, maybe even collaborate, and B. There's more motivation to solve a riddle, because it seems that whoever guesses correctly first gets a karma shower.

&gt;#3.What is your favorite riddle you know? (Can you give me the answer too? :D)**(Don't worry people
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** It's tough to pick
*A farmer needs to take a fox, which can only hold the farmer and one of the three items. Left unsupervised, the chicken will eat the grain, and the fox will eat the chicken (however, the fox won't try to eat the grain, nor will the fox or the chicken wander off). How does the farmer get everything across the river?*

&gt;#4. Is there a riddle you still don't know the answer to?
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** Of course not. The first and foremost requirement to become a moderator of /r/riddles is to know the answer to every single riddle there is.

&gt;#5.Is The Riddler your favorite Batman villain?
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** Definitely!

&gt;#6.What kind of riddles do you like? (""What am I?""
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** Really, I tend to like more lateral thinking ones- for example, this.

&gt;#7.What kind of riddles does this subreddit provide?
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** The subreddit has whatever riddles people post

&gt;#8.How is the community? Do many people try to solve the riddles?
&gt;&gt; **someguyinworld** The community is great! We've been getting more and more subscribers (AFAIK through relevant links to /r/riddles from AskReddit riddle posts), so if you think you have the answer, you'd better post quickly!

The answer:

&gt; *Take the chicken across

&gt;*Come back with the boat empty

&gt;*Take the grain across

&gt;*Take the chicken back

&gt;*Take the fox across

&gt;*Come back with the boat empty

&gt;*Take the chicken across
&gt;&gt; The answer to my riddle:

&gt;&gt; They switch horses.

######Something About Maps.

    It might not be the right time period.
    I might not be the smart one.
    But there's something about this map
    Cause there's something I love about them anyway.

    I might not be a cartographer.
    It might not be the perfect example.
    But there's something about this map
    Some kind of secret It wants to share with you.

    I need maps more than anything in my life.
    I want maps more than anything in my life.
    I love studying maps more than anyone in my life.
    I love you

I just had to let my heart speak it's peace. In the only way it knows how, we would be lost without them. Ask iPhone 5 users.  Maps, you come in ever color, shape, criteria, topic, language and media. You provide information like no other. You spark interest in the unknown. Blow dust off of cobwebbed minds. You help educate the uneducated. You are the guide to the buried treasure. The phrase *X marks the spot*, maps! Maps this is my ode to you.

Once again we at /r/SROTD are honoring another fine member of the **The Safe For Work Porn Network™**. This time its /r/MapPorn's time to shine. We had previously already featured /r/EarthPorn, /r/HumanPorn, /r/QuotesPorn, /r/RoomPorn &amp; hell even /r/Skyporn. One of these days we'll just have a SWFPN week... jeez these guys take their image cataloging seriously. And boy are we happy they do. Without these guys, I'd actually have to find images myself using google... like a barbarian. Now, whenever I want a High quality pics I just check if there is a porn subreddit for it. For example... /r/AnimalPorn. Yup it exists. *+subscribed!*

Anyway, only to be found, cleaned, professionally cut, carefully set into a elegant 22k vintage gold ring and sold to a beautiful young couple who want to start a family together. /r/MapPorn you are the prefect example of how awesome reddit can be. Everyday you surprise me with your fantastic new loot. I fear my eyes will eventually weaken due to the hard gazing I do in this subreddit. If only more subreddits could be more polished like you.

&gt;1 How did you get in to Maps? Why maps?

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** Maps are awesome. Think about it--what do you do when you don't know where to go? You use a map. Do you know how much harder video games would be without maps? E. B. White once said that everywhere in life was somewhere else and you get there in a car

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** I love how maps present the world around us in a familiar way

&gt;2 Whats your favorite map so far?

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** It's a tie between [**this**](http://www.bigmapblog.com/2011/oriental-map-of-the-korean-peninsula-1822/) and [**these**](http://www.bigmapblog.com/2011/four-maps-of-the-korean-penninsula-from-the-19th-century-author-unknown/). /u/bigmapblog is awesome.
 
&gt;&gt;**soupyhands**  Google Earth is my favorite map by far, and this one of [**Sir Names in America one**](http://i.imgur.com/dKw6I.jpg).

&gt; 3 What map has blown your mind?

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** It didn't really blow my mind but I found it to be really interested: [**Cotton production in 1860 vs. south voting in 2008.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/xxv20/cotton_production_in_1860_vs_south_voting_in_2008/)

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** This map was featured recently It shows the world divided into [**7 regions

&gt;4 If you got the chance to rename the continents what would you name them? Why?.

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** In Japan blocks are organized numerically. So if there were 5 buildings on a block the buildings would be 1, 4, and 5 respectively. That sounds really convenient and simple right? No. They are numbered in the order in which they are built so there is no way you can make use of the knowledge unless you have been living there your whole life. So I would number the continents in the order in which they were populated--or in the order of oldest to newest based on the archaeological evidence we have. I would not be opposed to renaming them every time we dig up new evidence that challenges the order.

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** I'd probably troll them with a Will Ferrell/Harry Caray reference: Mad Cow, Whiskers, Barbequed Spare Ribs, Hey, and Budweiser.

&gt;5 If you were offered a 1 way trip to Mars to make maps of our neighboring planet... would you go?

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** Only if I got to bring another spaceship with enough fuel and supplies to travel the distance between Earth and Mars.

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** What an opportunity! I would love to. Make sure I get a broadband internet connection though please.

Those of you who are Subreddit of the Day savvy will be quick to point out that /r/adventuretime [has been featured before](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/m9kdz/november_12_2011_radventuretime_i_wrote_a_song/).   No fears

Since it was last featured, they have an entirely new mod team.  In addition, I became a fan of the show and am super obsessed with it.  Obviously, with this much change to the community, I felt it deserved a revisit.

For those of you who aren’t in the know, and that’s why it’s so awesome.

I sat down with the mods to discuss the brand new /r/adventuretime subreddit.

&gt;#1. So

&gt;&gt;**shoshanish** well, I made a sub for them, /r/adventurememes, which caused me having to contact him to put the sub in the sidebar. At that time he seemed cool but stiff, and I wondered why I didn't see more of him. As time went on, I searched him up on reddits seachbar and found that he was terrible. I also saw that someone had made a throwaway,/r/ATthrowawaymakemeamod, adding my own points. I added him as a friend and kept close tabs, hoping for his demotion. The bot denied us, I log on

&gt;&gt;**The_Yoshi** I had wanted to become a mod of /r/adventuretime ever since I saw what the old mod(s) were doing...or weren't doing that is. When I joined reddit, I found /r/regularshow, and noticed that it had some cool CSS that made the sub more fun to look at and be on. I then proceeded to ask the community why/r/adventuretime wasn't all customized to look cool when I got a reply from a rude, burnt-out mod (BD) that seemed like he hated the place and didn’t want to give back anything. Still trying to make something happen, I sent a spritesheet of a couple flairs along with the CSS that went with it to the old mods and they just shrugged it off for one reason or another, despite the attention it got from the community. Things went on like that for awhile, with a complaint about the mods at least once every week. Then, and I guess the remaining mod gave in and kindly turned controll over to a throwaway that complained, I got an invite to become a mod of one of the best subreddits ever!

&gt;&gt;**Miiyao** Originally I joined to do discussion threads. I started getting picky about how I wanted the sub reddit to look so I started making all the graphics and images you see... I spend most of my time making new themes for the sub reddit. (The next one is going to be a Jake and Lady Rainicorn theme!) I just started doing this stuff like 2 months ago so I'm sort of new to it but I'm progressively getting better!

&gt;&gt;**gotohell666** I noticed that there wasn't any real discussion about the Adventure Time comic, user /r/infamousbacon liked the idea of someone doing comic discussions and when I presented the idea, he let me onto the team.

&gt;&gt;**Cats_In_Space** Becoming a mod of adventuretime has been an amazing experience with a great group of people. When /u/infamous_bacon got control of r/adventuretime he needed a mod team to help run it. I applied just hoping I would get a shot at helping the subreddit become a better place. Later that day I got a message from /u/infamous_bacon saying that he thought I would be a great addition to the mod team

&gt;#2. Besides the number of followers and the mods

&gt;&gt;**shoshanish** Rules, mii and myself. We redesigned the rules, and I LOVE talking with the community.

&gt;&gt;**The_Yoshi**  We have had some big rule changes, Cats_from_space, and myself worked on the visuals, implementing, a nice background, banner, flair, making /r/adventuretimea nicer place to be! This also had an effect on the amount of related subs. There are multiple categories of sub-subreddits that have recently emerged due to the friendlier and more populated atmosphere. There is now official weekly discussions to prevent several different discussion threads. We also now have comic book discussions hosted by gotohell666

&gt;&gt;**Miiyao** I'd say the attitude... Everyone around here is really excited about the changes and the new season kinda boosted that. We add to that excitement by setting up AMAs and contests during the down times.

&gt;&gt;**gotohell666** I think this subreddit has come a very long way in terms of looking visually appealing and the quality of content. The place looks amazing thanks to the other mods: The_Yoshi, Psyblurmist, and Cats_In_Space, since I can't do CSS to save my life. The problem of reposted content, along with NSFW images have been taken care of with a very effective spam filter for reposts and an additional subreddit for NSFW content.

&gt;&gt;**Cats_In_Space** The_Yoshi has done some great work with the CSS, Miiyao, psyblurmist, shoshanish, and gotohell666 also check through the new posts and spam posts constantly, to make sure the content is relevant, and is appropriate; that way our subscribers are getting most out of the subreddit and its features.

&gt;#3. The first episode I saw was the Princess Cookie one

&gt;&gt;**shoshanish**  Hm... this is a tough one. I'd say probably say the story arc from mortal folly, or just start from episode 1. No one episode really captures everything we love about adventure time, so just start from episode one. the first season doesnt make a lot of sense, and doesn;t really have plot, but it lays down characters that are important later on. Season 2 has the first plot shapings, is really the plot sprouting, 4 is it starting to come together and so far season 5 has laid down alot

&gt;&gt;**The_Yoshi** To be honest, but stand out to veterans of the show. However, if I did have a single episode that shows the true colors of the show, I'd probably say ""Ocean of Fear."" It brings out the unique animation style of the show, and emphasizes the surreal type plot.

&gt;&gt;**Miiyao** ""Evicted"" is a good one to start at.

&gt;&gt;**gotohell666** I definitely recommend ""Dungeon!"" or ""The Enchidirion"". both have the right amount of Adventure with the right amount of silliness.

&gt;&gt;**Cats_In_Space** My favorite is card wars

&gt;#4. Let’s revisit a question from the first interview.  If you could be any character on the show

&gt;&gt;**shoshanish** Another toughy.... probably jake

&gt;&gt;**The_Yoshi** Jake all the way! He has these amazing powers that he can do so much with

&gt;&gt;**Miiyao** Jay T. Dawgzone

&gt;&gt;**gotohell66** Oh man, then he's making a sandwich. Hell, the dude even visit's his daughter's concerts with a polo shirt and dockers, (dad attire).

&gt;&gt;**Cats_In_Space** BMO! He can do so many things! He can play VHS tapes and video games from before the mushroom war! He even has an alter ego named football. Plus

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**shoshanish** I would like to add something about the others mods. Let me start off by saying these guys are AMAZING, lets lets get individual. Bacon had that leaderish feel, but he hasn't been on for a while, sadly. I miss him, he really straightened anything and everything out fast. Cats has ideas, jokes around, is very helpful, as well as the image man. He is always there, helps with approving posts and a bit in the css. Myself? I do a lot of community work, and I couldn't ask to be part of a better team.

&gt;&gt;**gotohell666** We just had a very successful AMA with Adventure Time's Executive Producer Fred Seibert, the place looked bland and unappealing, pretty surprising for a community centered around a very ""up and coming"" show. They were also terrible in terms of communicating with users since most of their replies were insults. It was only a matter of time before the community decided it was time for a change. I have to say, I'm really glad to be a part of this mod team. They're all down to earth people who are very passionate about Adventure Time, and in thinking of ways to make the subreddit even better.

&gt;&gt;**Cats_In_Space** I would just like to thank r/subredditoftheday for not only featuring us once, a big thanks to Freakazette for taking my answers late, really sorry for doing this to you) I would also like to give a huge thanks to the rest of the mod team, this has been amazing, and I can't wait to continue moderating with such an awesome mod group!

&gt;&gt;**Miiyao** All of the moderators on here get along amazingly well and we have a blast talking to each other every day. It makes moderating A LOT easier when you have a good team that agrees on everything.

&gt;&gt;Also would like to add that InfamousBacon

No

Summer's here

For those who are both gamers and LGBT, but with the gay touch, it is truly its own community that reaches out to a variety of others.  

Regardless of your orientation or video game habbits


----

&gt;##/r/gaymers? Is this a community setup for people who like adding in letters to words?

&gt;&gt;**synspark**: Only for letters that are sometimes vowel-ish? I don't mean to be discriminatory

&gt;##What is the main purpose of your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**synspark**:  Gaymers is all about gaymers. One of the biggest misconceptions about our subreddit is that we're around to talk mostly about LGBTetc themes in gaming. If we did that, and about their lives, their experiences, whether they be gaming-related or not. It's by, for, and about gaymers.

&gt;##What sort of posts can a subscriber expect in the group?


&gt;&gt;**synspark**:  Anything and everything. If someone finds something interesting, and let them shape the content. Sometimes that means 10 similar meme posts filling up the frontpage, sometimes it's a little more informative or creative. Every now and then we'll do a self-photos post, too.

&gt;##Are there any specifically lgbt-friendly games you'd like to recommend? Or what are your favorite games in general?

&gt;&gt;**synspark**:   Right now, which I absolutely adored... and I suppose the Portal series could count, but the shooting isn't nearly as fast-paced, nor is the aiming as precise. I also really enjoy simulation-ish games, Like Anno 2070, and Civ.

&gt;##How does /r/gaymers blend the ""gay"" and the ""game"" together?

&gt;&gt;**synspark**:  Every now and then you'll come across an LGBT theme in gaming that bears discussion, but when /r/gaymers is at its best, it blows any other general gaming discussion forum out of the water.

&gt;##Please describe yourselves

&gt;&gt;**synspark**: I'm a 33 year old gay bearish guy, and I firmly believe that wasn't a choice, and was probably genetically determined. I'm occasionally also a geek. I enjoy gaming (duh), overworking myself, politics, and have a hobby-ish interest in astrophysics, particle physics

&gt;##If you could design a game for the subscribers of /r/gaymers

&gt;&gt;Can i just redo Final Fantasy XIII and have Hope and Snow get together? That would work.

&gt;&gt;Additional notes: Modding /r/gaymers as long as I have has been an awesome experience, discuss random crap...whatever. I've met some really awesome people... some of the closest friends I have... through /r/gaymers. Guys and girls, you're all amazing. Keep an eye out for some fun stuff we're going to try to do this summer &lt;3

Some of you may remember the good old days, they're like Newton’s Third Law but applied in terms of Reddit. Every Force has an equal and opposite force therefore every Subreddit has an equal and Shitty or Circlejerk Subreddit. To determine whether this Law applies to a Subreddit is impossible as it only applies because it does. I'm certain there’s a relevant Xkcd for this and a TV Trope expertly defining this phenomenon but let's avoid that and instead move swiftly onwards.

Now this is /r/ShittyBattlestations

With a healthy dose of how terrible some people’s setups are, they have developed a ski-... no the **Art** of  taking what will and will not work and finding the perfect balance. At this point I could go on to speculate on the mythology of this and whether there is a deeper psychological meaning but will all know it goes no further than one friend saying to another “Dude your setup is the worst ever” and the friend responding “Oh yeah but I bet I can make it worse.” These men (assuming women know nothing about computers) have found what it means to be a true engineer. For it is not the skill to make things work but the skill to make things so close to not working you can’t believe that it still does.

Finally we have a few surprisingly unshitty words from the man (again yet another baseless sexist statement) who made it all possible /u/thrillhousevanhouten.

&gt;##1. It’s obvious this is a parody of /r/Battlestations but what encouraged the formation of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **thrillhousevanhouten** I remember seeing a lot of elitist posts in /r/battlestations responding negatively to people if their computers didn't look like they doubled as cars from Fast &amp; the Furious. On one hand I understand why people would want to see more relevant subject matter in a sub but people were getting way too mean spirited about it.

&gt;##2. Does a Battlestation have to be a computer?

&gt;&gt; **thrillhousevanhouten** Typically. I've seen a lot of posts where it's really obvious a person has gone through the trouble of just throwing trash around their laptop or PC for the sake of some karma. Sweet dude

&gt;##3. Which user’s Battlestation blew you away in terms of Shittyness?

&gt;&gt; **thrillhousevanhouten** I definitely have some personal favorites. There are some like [this](http://i.imgur.com/tymMh.jpg) where not only is it hilariously shitty but also fairly ingenuitive in its functionality which I love. Then there are posts like [this](http://i.imgur.com/wEIzH.jpg) and [this](http://imgur.com/a/5j1nH) that make me suspect half the content submitters of my sub are murderous sex offenders.

&gt;##4. How Shitty is your own Battlestation?

&gt;&gt; **thrillhousevanhouten** Admittedly my battlestation is not very shitty (anymore). A lot of disposable income over the years has funnelled into my nerd lair.

&gt;##5. What would you like to say to your Shitty Community?!

&gt;&gt; **thrillhousevanhouten** I was only half kidding about the whole ""murderous sex offenders"" thing. You're probably only sex offenders.

**3164** improv fanatics practicing their art for **8 months.**

I'm one of those weirdos that actually doesn't have cable (/r/cordcutters). So when I like a show, /r/BSG, and more recently /r/Suits, /r/BreakingBad &amp; /r/GameOfThrones are just some of my favorite shows right now. But my all time favorite comedy show isn't even a sitcom or a *dramedy*. Its a fun loving improv show that used to air on ABC I think? It was called /r/WhoseLineIsItAnyway. 

/r/WhoseLineIsItAnyway was a live studio audience show with a host, I suggest, writing your will, eating as much as you can, and taking that bathroom break now... cause once you start, you're not gonna stop till you see all 18 seasons. 10 from the original UK version &amp; 8 from the American version. Yes, like all good funny things, but Michael never left the show... *sigh* /r/DunderMifflin.

The two main *stars* of this crazy show were Colin Mochrie &amp; Ryan Stiles. They have this chemistry that is soo unique its actually unreproducible! Ryan with his lovely shoes and his constant look of annoyance and Colin with his sheepish smirk and quick wit were an unstoppable force to be reckoned with. Too bad ABC is owned by Disney, another fellow alumni of the show. He specialty was in, on the spot lyric creation, singing and physical performance. He too is a master of the dark arts of improv.

Over the years the many members of the main cast has tired over and over again to recreate the magic. But nothing seems to *click*. Here is hoping one day it will.

As the title aptly says

Anyone who plays computer games has played age of empires 2. Its not possible that he/she has left it out. ITS NOT POSSIBLE. If someone in this planet hasn't, and play it.

Age of empires 2 or AOE 2

Age of empires 2 is a very satisfying and a fun game. even after 12 years of its release it is still played in many homes and no one has forgotten about it. That is what meant by a classic. The sequel of the game Age of empires 3 did not appeal to me as much the predecessor did but to each his own of course. AOE 1 was a good game but it was definitely more simple than the 2nd though i liked its graphics better :D

the various scenarios, the maps and its various other features make this game a really awesome experience for everyone and i have lots of loving memories playing this game :3 Recently the HD version has been released so that the new PCs can play it better. For such an old game to be remade into HD shows the popularity and the bar set by the game.

So proudly presenting this sub

&gt;##1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**sixtyt3:** AOE2 is one of the oldest strategy games out there (by current standards). It's also perhaps the only game which has a very fanatical &amp; rabid fan following - in that a vast majority of the following wouldn't move to the newer versions (AOE3 or Age of Mythology) of the game. The game is just 'perfect' the way it is. I'm one of those fans. Though I've tried to play both AOM and AOE3 (and the trash that is AOE Online)
**Mind_Killer:** I didn't have much of a choice. When it comes to video games, several people had already suggested my name before I even applied.  
**Cheesydude:** I love the game and supporting it through this subreddit I enjoy doing - i'll soon be working on updating the stylesheet to better fit the game's aesthetics as well :)   
**madlordofmilk:** It's just a fantastic community. I love the game and have gotten a lot of help out of the subreddit
**JeffersonThomas:** What motivates me to moderate this sub is helping to keep this community together for the next 15 years. After MSN Zone closed many years ago
**CysionBE:** Just the love for the game. I went from a casual player

&gt;##2. How long have you been playing AOE2 for ?
&gt;&gt;**sixtyt3:**  AOE2 is one of the oldest strategy games out there (by current standards). It's also perhaps the only game which has a very fanatical &amp; rabid fan following - in that a vast majority of the following wouldn't move to the newer versions (AOE3 or Age of Mythology) of the game. The game is just 'perfect' the way it is. I'm one of those fans. Though I've tried to play both AOM and AOE3 (and the trash that is AOE Online)
**Mind_Killer:** I've been playing AOE2 since AOE2 was AOE1. I still remember my dad and I looking forward to the game's release back in 1999. To be fair
**Cheesydude:** Probably about 10-12 years at this point
**madlordofmilk:** Since the HD re-release. I also played the original when I was younger.   
**JeffersonThomas:** I've been playing AOE2 as long as possible for a retail player
**CysionBE:** Pretty much since the release back in 1999

 
&gt;##3. Which is your favourite civilization and why ?
&gt;&gt;**sixtyt3:**  It depends on the map. Vikings for any water based map because they breed boats like crazy - and goths for land maps.  
**Mind_Killer:** The Mayans. The ""Meso"" civs are the coolest looking
**Cheesydude:** Persians
**madlordofmilk:** Byzantines. Their tech tree is open to pretty much any path you want for units
**JeffersonThomas:** My favorite civilization has changed over the years and at this point
**CysionBE:** Random! Other than that Byzantines
 

&gt;##4. If you could be one unit of AOE2 which one would it be and why ?
&gt;&gt;**sixtyt3:**  Teutonic knights because MOTHERFUCKING CAPES.  
**Mind_Killer:** One of the three starting villagers. Because I don't want to die. I want to stay close to the Town Center. I will garrison my butt inside that TC before anyone even rings the bell if I smell danger. And if you ask to me to lure a boar without Loom, I can pick the crap outa some berries.  
**Cheesydude:** A monk! 30 30 30 30  
**madlordofmilk:** Samurai! No particular reason
**JeffersonThomas:** This is an interesting question to answer. Much like my answer to favorite civilization
**CysionBE:** The hawk
 

&gt;##5. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**sixtyt3:**  Play to have fun. For new players - stop worrying about your skills - and stop calling yourself noobs. Because the purpose of the game is not to be super efficient at beating your rivals. The main purpose is to have fun. With Steam, Heros) that don't need specific economy based skills. I think the pressure of performing (or winning) takes the fun out of this outstanding game.  
**Mind_Killer:** There are very few ""new"" players to this game anymore. Even if you're pretty new
**Cheesydude:** I hope you enjoy the changes we're going to be making to the stylesheet to make the subreddit more akin to the game itself.  
**madlordofmilk:** AOE2 is a really approachable game as a newbie
**JeffersonThomas:** You played 2 hours to die like this?  
**CysionBE:** I remember the first time I played AoE2 online

In my opinion, you need to find some way to get those ~~mini~~ XXL condoms. As written above, walking is too slow and too ""healthy"" and not everyone has a bicycle. It's not freaking everywhere like the Netherlands. 
But suddenly a kind of skateboard looking thingie is rolled towards you (*a warm light is seen and singing angels are heard in the background*)

Then you might say: ""But there are more people using bicycles than longboards"". Well guess what ""person""

But what exactly is a longboard? I will try to explain it in a few senteces. First of all, no, you have [all kinds of tricks](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1hlxim/im_into_this_dancing_maniac/.compact) made just for the longboard. These moves make turn longboarding into a challenge. And for the people who can't even stand on a board for 5 seconds, like me, you can always [watch it from the side line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1lPkGYUDaY). 

/r/Longboard is here to talk about longboarding

I talked with the mods about the subreddit and their thoughts about longboarding.

&gt;#1. How did you get in touch with this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** I first discovered /r/longboarding 2 years ago when I first joined reddit. I knew there had to be a longboarding presence somewhere on the site


&gt;&gt; **Squidifier** I joined the mod team about 3 months ago, I was asked to join.

&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** We (the mods replying) didn't make the subreddit

&gt;&gt;    **Xuis**    The current moderation team stepped up a few months ago when the majority of the previous moderation team needed to step out due to other obligations.  We are all very excited to have the opportunity to contribute so much to the community that we frequented so often.  


&gt;#2. Are you a longboard user

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** Of course I am a longboarder :D My favorite aspect of the sport is the community


&gt;&gt; **Squidifier** Yep! All of us on the mod team skate regularly. The thing I like most about longboarding would have to be the way it takes something as simple as transport, to heading down to the shops... I honestly can't say I've ever had a bad time on my board!

&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** I distance skate

&gt;&gt;    **Xuis**    Aside from skating being my primary form of transportation, it is a large part of our lives, and we love being able to participate in the Reddit community so actively.

&gt;#3. What is your best/worst experience with longboarding?

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** Best experience: Every new event I get to attend becomes my new favorite experience. I also love taking pictures and video of my friends skating and seeing their reactions when they see how well it turns out.
Worst experience: Besides the falls? Having my videos or pictures be used by Longboard companies with no credit to me. Being ripped off by the people that make the gear you skate with feels shitty.
Most underestimated film? Miami Connection. That movie is a treasure trove of terrible and should be cherished by everyone for all time.


&gt;&gt; **Squidifier** Best: It would have to be the time a friend and I went way up into the mountains surrounding Manila, and did an incredible run down the biggest hill I've skated with the sun rising on my right hand side. Just incredible...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Worst: I can't really think of a worst time. Maybe the time when [my board broke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/14lkkh/well_this_sucks_quite_a_lot/) I honestly can't say!

&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** My best experience would probably have been an event called The Hunt which is also organized by Chicago Push Races (along with The Clark Street Bomb). I showed up to the scavenger hunt with a friend and had a stranger join my team. We ended up skating about 10 miles around the city and finished in second place. Mini Maryhill was also a blast. That was a short elimination/bracket style downhill race at a park in the suburbs. About 30 skaters were there. The course was short but there was a really tight S-turn that made it difficult enough to be fun and exciting to watch.

&gt;&gt;    **Xuis**    Best experience:  My first time at an invitational competitive longboard race.

&gt;&gt;Worst experience:  My longboard falling down a storm-drain.


&gt;#4. What problem do most beginners experience

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** Most beginners have problems learning to become stable on their boards

&gt;&gt; **Squidifier** Most new skaters have problems with confidence - and while that's something that for some never stops being a problem
Skating with people better than you also helps amazingly - both with boosting your confidence on a board

&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** A lot of beginners seem to have the most trouble picking gear and learning how to slide. There's plenty of info on how to slide that can be found by searching in the subreddit

&gt;#5. What makes longboarding so special?

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** The people. I would not be longboarding if it wasn't for all the positive and encouraging people I've met along the way. Skating with a buddy is always more fun than skating alone.

&gt;&gt;    **Xuis**    Surprisingly

&gt;&gt;Longboarding is in a very unique social state right now.  We're at a time where you can get in contact with a world champion

&gt;&gt;This


&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** I think what makes longboarding special is what makes it the shares with bikes and cars. There are different styles and there's something to find in it for almost everyone. You can freeride (doing different slides while going down hill), distance skate, downhill (speeds ranging from 15mph-50+. The record is eightysomething), carve, techslide (lots of crazy downhill sliding on a shortboard-like setup), commute or just do whatever you want as long as you're having fun.

&gt;#6. Do you have tips for beginners?

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** Get a helmet and pads! I really cannot stress how important it is to protect your head

&gt;&gt; **Squidifier** Get safety gear. This is seriously important, gloves and pads. ([Check it out!](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1ekyd2/squidifiers_insanely_long_what_should_i_get_post/ca187mj))

&gt;&gt;Not only does it keep you… well… safe


&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** My tips: 

&gt;&gt;1- Sometimes when skating in public places you look like a jerk. Don't actually be a jerk. 

&gt;&gt;2- wear a helmet. Don't worry about how you look. The pros wear them too. 

&gt;&gt;3- set your bushings up right according to your weight/style. There are resources in the subreddit to help. 

&gt;&gt;4- Loose trucks save lives.

&gt;&gt;4b- be aware of your environment. While in downtown chicago I've nearly hit cars/pedestrians/poles/curbs/potholes and nearly been hit by cars/trucks/pedestrians and almost run over more times in the last 9 months than I can count. I am not a particularly reckless skater and I abide to the rules of the road. (Note that this one geared more towards people in dense cities.)
&gt;&gt; 5- Grow by pushing your limits and not by suddenly surpassing them. Don't start bombing your local hill from the top; start at a lower point until you get used to the speed. Same with every other aspect of skating. 
&gt;&gt;6- You're going to get speed wobbles. When you do: lean forward

&gt;&gt;    **Xuis**    Do some research before getting your first board

&gt;&gt;Don't skate faster than you can stop.

&gt;&gt;The more you skate

&gt;&gt;Be excellent to each other.  


&gt;#7. What can a new subscriber find on this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** We just updated the subreddit with a wiki that covers everything you need to know from what safety gear to buy

&gt;&gt; **Squidifier** For a new subscriber who's new to longboarding as well, including a number of different buying guides, tips, tutorials and resources for a new longboarder.
And for a new subscriber who does skate,' where anyone can ask pretty much anything about longboarding!


&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** By checking in frequently you can learn pretty much everything there is to learn about longboarding that there is to learn. Both from individual users and from the sidebar/wiki. I learned almost everything I know from /r/longboarding and was helping people out before I actually had a board. On top of that its cool to see pictures and videos of people skating their local spots

&gt;&gt;    **Xuis**    If you subscribe to this subreddit

&gt;#8. Would you like to add anything?

&gt;&gt; **QuitoPR** I am super stoked to see the community react so well to our changes to the subreddit and I look forward to helping it grow for years to come!

&gt;&gt; **Squidifier** I'd just like to thank all of the contributors who make this sub what it is - as well as my fellow mods for striving so hard to make this community better! We hit 30

&gt;&gt; **Broken_S_Key** Stay safe

&gt;&gt;    **Xuis**    The community on /r/Longboarding encompasses my favorite people on Reddit.  I'm so happy to be a part of it.
Skate fast; take chances.

**27

Everyone has a shower, we think of these stupid things like “What if Lil’ Wayne for real is not a human?” - /u/polakaflakaflame. Or “How much money could I have saved if I didn’t drink beer or coffee?” - /u/UsernameTaken321. You wanted me to type up my own thoughts? Well, I’m not in the shower so I kinda have to take some unoriginality here and steal people’s thoughts, but whatever, let’s get back onto the subject.

Back then when we were just wee-little kiddies, being the teenagers/adults we are, we think about life and use the shower for what it’s for... sometimes. Honestly, my inner toddler comes out and I talk to myself occasionally using silly voices, might sing in those voices sometimes. Don’t call me weird! Call me limited edition!

Am I going off subject again? Ok then

If you’ve just had a slightly clever thought recently in a shower, I know. To make you forget about that disturbing image, let’s move on to the interview with the mods of this terrific subreddit!

&gt;##1. What made you become a moderator on /r/Showerthoughts?

&gt;&gt; **/u/kjoneslol** I was taking a shower and I thought

&gt;&gt; **/u/drumcowski** I had the idea for /r/ShowerThoughts in the shower, neither of which worked. So, I ended up PM'ing the moderator - and after a few days I convinced him to let me have a go with the subreddit. For anyone curious, [this is what ShowerThoughts looked like before I took over.](http://i.imgur.com/YKMi4i1.png)

&gt;&gt; **/u/ManWithoutModem** Drumcowski came up with the idea and sent me a mod invite since we are friends.

&gt;&gt; **/u/HandicapperGeneral** I liked it, and they added me.

&gt;&gt; **/u/stopscopiesme** Drumcowski adding me.

&gt;##2. What was your first shower thought? If you can't remember

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** This water is making me hungry.

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** I've had plenty, and [""In gaming, the ""Start"" button is mostly used to pause the game.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/19r10c/in_gaming_the_start_button_is_mostly_used_to/)

&gt;&gt; **ManWithoutModem** I can't remember my first shower thought

&gt;&gt; **HandicapperGeneral** If dogs' sense of smell is so powerful

&gt;&gt; **stopscopiesme** Most recent: There are over 7 billion people in this world, its almost like they don't exist.

&gt;##3. What's your favourite shower thought?

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** You wouldn't ask a parent who their favourite child is.

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** I have a few. [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1anqgh/gyms_are_just_rooms_full_of_heavy_stuff_that_you/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1a2dm8/what_if_i_am_actually_mentally_challenged_and/), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1a1uav/imagine_how_many_near_death_experiences_you/), [6](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/19zhta/the_first_person_to_have_twins_must_have_been_so/).

&gt;&gt; **ManWithoutModem** From the ones that I've read? Probably [this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1ex18y/you_wake_up_when_you_die_in_a_dream_because_you/)

&gt;&gt; **HandicapperGeneral** ""I'm out of shampoo.""

&gt;&gt; **stopscopiesme** Oddly enough

&gt;##4. What makes a good shower thought?

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** It should be a thought and it should definitely be in a shower.

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** A good showerthought doesn't need to be grounded in any logic, you don't need to have thought about it in the shower, ""Showerthought"" really just applies to any thought you have while doing something routine - like driving, or daydreaming. *Alternatively* - a bad showerthought is a simple ""Shower Observations"", like ""I wonder what the temperature of the water is."" or ""Forgot to buy more shampoo. Damn."" We recently banned posts like these.

&gt;&gt; **ManWithoutModem** Something that comes to you that you know you would never have thought of if it weren't for the fact that you are showering and zoning out thinking about random bs.

&gt;&gt; **HandicapperGeneral** Irony or the vague sense that the person having the thought is extremely high.

&gt;&gt; **stopscopiesme** Deep, there are a lot of things that make a shower thought worth reading. It's usually the very strange ones that I remember.

&gt;##5. Anything to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** Hello!

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** ***Scroll down!*** There's a lot of great content hidden behind a few pages

&gt;&gt; **ManWithoutModem** Stay clean.

&gt;&gt; **HandicapperGeneral** SUP HOMIES. BOW BEFORE YOUR OVERLORDS.

&gt;I could be a different person.  Someone better than me.  I could be your favorite person.  Just tell me who to be.
- [Cosmo Jarvis

I'm convinced that this song is horribly depressing because someone is giving up who they are for love, but I see the potential there.  I wish I could find a place where I can post something I'm questioning or wanting to understand further to change my mind.  Sadly, there is no place like that.

There have been rumors of a subreddit called /r/ChangeMyView.  I believe it exists, though, I'd just post why I'd believe something and ask have my view changed.  Someone would post a response, and the most upvoted response would change my view, right?  Probably.  That's how reddit works.  Upvotes count for everything.  Errr.... I guess I could actually *read* the comments, and the ones that are the most insightful - actually taking time to address the concerns I posted about when explaining my original view would be the ones to pay attention to.

Now.  Tell me who to be

&gt;&gt;**protagornast**: Well, then you might be pleased to know that /r/changemyview is responsible for changing /u/Styx_'s view that homosexuality is a choice ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1a29o0/i_think_that_homosexuality_is_a_choice_cmv/)) and helping /u/aviavy sympathize more with those who have undergone gender reassignment ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18eac7/i_dont_accept_the_reassigned_gender_of_people_who/)).

&gt;&gt;**spblat**: Find me another thriving community that talks about controversial stuff where ""...but I may be wrong"" is a required subtext to all discussion.

&gt;&gt;**TryUsingScience**: You've already done the work of finding the subreddit and messaging us and coming up with questions. Do you really want to waste all that work? I didn't think so.

&gt;## Why do people post to have their views changed?

&gt;&gt;**Snorrrlax**: There are some people who believe things but wish they could be proved wrong

&gt;&gt;**protagornast**: Motivations vary. Some people may have doubts about their current belief and are already halfway toward changing it. Others have a fatalistic outlook on life and want to see the silver lining in something so they can endure hardships that are beyond their control. Others don't really want to change their view to X but want help seeing how it is possible that people who believe X might not be complete idiots.

&gt;&gt;**spblat**: I don't quite know

&gt;&gt;**TryUsingScience**: Some of them are genuinely bothered by their views. They believe themselves to be politically regressive, but want to be sure they're aware of all the arguments out there.

&gt;## What have you found makes a convincing argument to change someone's view?

&gt;&gt;**Snorrrlax**: Some views are changed with cold hard facts, which if posted anywhere else would probably spin out of control. Yet here, users are encouraged to keep an open-mind about even the most outrageous assertions, as this has a better effect on OP.

&gt;&gt;**protagornast**: Sometimes it's obvious that the OP has just never heard arguments from a different perspective on the issue before, it demonstrates the value of an online community like ours: we provide a place for those who have been insulated from alternative viewpoints to hear different perspectives. When the OP is more informed about the topic they want to discuss, they are much more likely to change their view if users take them on their own terms.

&gt;&gt;**spblat**: The CMV model requires the craziest claims to be refuted just as they are posed: calmly

&gt;&gt;**TryUsingScience**: I've found that logic works most often

&gt;## What are your favorite CMV posts?

&gt;&gt;**Snorrrlax**: One of my favourites is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17xo7u/i_think_of_girls_who_are_no_longer_virgin_as/) one - After OP's view has been changed

&gt;&gt;**protagornast**: My favorite CMV posts are the ones I never could have predicted, I was worried that most of the posts would simply alternate between opposing viewpoints on the topics of abortion, gay marriage, and the existence of God, but this has never been the case. Certain topics (anarcho-capitalism, Apple products being overrated, gun control, but there's still a lot of diversity.

&gt;&gt;**TryUsingScience**: My two favourites are the ones on really controversial issues where I have to do zero moderation because everyone is being so polite

&gt;&gt;**spblat**: My favorite CMV post is any one where I earn a delta! See below.


&gt;## What's with the delta?

&gt;&gt;**Snorrrlax**: /u/protagornast came up with the original idea of replying to comments with a delta ([which represents change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_(letter\))), and then updates user flair and a leaderboard. I feel this really encourages better quality comments - people love internet points!

&gt;&gt;**protagornast**: I came up with the idea of giving deltas after hearing someone talk about a point Kathryn Shulz makes in [*Being Wrong*](http://www.amazon.com/Being-Wrong-Adventures-Margin-Error/dp/0061176052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364272448&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Being+Wrong). I haven't read the book, incorrect view with the new, correct one so that we will be ""right"" again. Originally, I envisioned deltas being mostly for the benefit of the OP--a sort of tally mark to help keep track of how many times OPs realized they had been wrong on even the most minor of points in their argument. Pretty soon, it became clear that the natural human desire for imaginary internet points is a strong motivator for users to be kinder to OPs and make more convincing arguments, and that is a very nice side-effect.

&gt;&gt;**spblat**: I think it's great. So much Internet discourse is people just flinging poo at each other

&gt;&gt;**TryUsingScience**: Imaginary internet points are the driver behind most of the interaction on this site. Deltas are a newer

&gt;## Whenever I look out my apartment

&gt;&gt;**Snorrrlax**: We cannot physically change the view outside your window from a parking lot to something like Niagara Falls

&gt;&gt;**protagornast**: I can't change your view, and whoever gets 3-in-a-row first wins! Alternatively, draw a wormhole, gateway, or your favorite bodily orifice and wait for a car to drive through it or a person to walk through it. Take a picture and post for karma. Also, do you still have an imagination? When I was a kid, buildings weren't buildings and cars weren't cars

&gt;&gt;**spblat**: [You think that's *air* you're breathing now?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWaxF8jlnm0)

&gt;&gt;**TryUsingScience**: Sure. Try hanging up a poster in front of the window. Maybe of a tropical sunset?

Ah, its system requirements in beta was its own selling point, with thousands of puffed-chest gamers each proclaiming that *their* rig could handle it at max. Few met the challenge, and even fewer lived to tell the tale. Now that the game has launched, and with loads of optimization, it can be played by the masses.

Emphasis on the ""mass"", I am Planetside-less. My old laptop, forged in the fires of dog crap by Dell, cannot even start the game without dying. I'm so far below the system requirements that the store page just displays a small frowny face and offers me a hug. From what I hear, though, many others are able to enjoy this fine specimen of gaming without such problems As a die hard fan of Planetside 1, I will continue to vicariously live my gaming life through TotalBiscuit as he plays things I cannot.

For those of you who either cannot or do not wish to play Planetside 2

I sat down with the heads of this pack's Reddit presence for a few questions. As usual, /r/Planetside.

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**seeQer11** I joined the subreddit's mods near the beginning when we were only a couple hundred users when the first news of Planetside 2 was announced. I did most of the original CSS groundwork

&gt;&gt;**RoyAwesome** This subreddit was founded in the later days of Planetside 1's lifetime, I joined the subreddit mods early on, soon after Planetside 2 was announced (like seeQer11). I've focused primarily on community building inside the game and out, running the subreddit's ingame Outfit, and trying to be a presence in the community.

&gt;&gt;**badgerhax** Not much interesting about me. I've been playing planetside2 since early beta and they pulled me onto the mod squad to help with the transition to being a huge subeditor on release.

&gt;&gt;**ArcFault** I am an internet warrior. I primarily play on the VS faction but I like to play the other factions as well with different Outfits from time to time.

&gt;#2. Planetside is a huge game

&gt;&gt;**seeQer11** We try to let our users dictate the content as much as possible without getting involved. The main area where we are involved in moderation is our No Memes

&gt;&gt;**RoyAwesome** The general goal of the Planetside 2 outfit is that it is a place for redditors to play the game together, lead a squad or platoon, or form a specialized group just by saying 'Hey, I want to do this'. There is no difference between leadership and membership, everyone is free to do what they want to do. It's an interesting experiment into running a group, and it seems to be working. We had some issues scaling up to 1700 members ingame, but things have seemed to stabilize and a core group of players has formed that is comfortable leading and doing things.

&gt;#3. Let's say you could change one thing in the game

&gt;&gt;**seeQer11**  No Kill/Death ratio

&gt;&gt;**RoyAwesome** Planetside 2 was launched with potential. The game is fun. The shooting mechanics are satisfying. It's fundamentally a good game. Personally, more defendable facilities that control territory. I feel that there is a pretty big problem that a small base with 4 shacks and a spawn room is just as significant in the territory game as an Amp Station or a Tech Plant.

&gt;&gt;**badgerhax** The most important change I see coming in the future is the addition of more continents and having directional links between them. It would really make it one continuous fight instead of three separate ones.

&gt;&gt;**ArcFault** Planetside 2 has a really rich and complex meta game. It's very rewarding and I wouldn't change a thing. Vehicles could be a tad cheaper as some of the opposing outfits have indicated the we under-utilize the Magrider and the Liberator (Our Tank and Bomber

&gt;#4. I have to ask

&gt;&gt;**seeQer11** Several months before beta I built a new rig in anticipation; i5 2500k, gtx 560 ti oc and a 250gb intel SSD with a sexy white corsair 600T case.

&gt;&gt;**RoyAwesome** I have an AMD Phenom x6

&gt;&gt;**badgerhax** AMD phenom II x4 processor Ge-force 280 TI and I average 40fps

&gt;&gt;**ArcFault** I have an i5 3570k and an ATI 7850 - stock clocks. I usually average about 40-45 fps in medium sized battles running on high settings. In huge battles that can drop down to 25-30 fps. I plan to overclock and possibly upgrade my GPU so that I can record/stream as well as enjoy the Ultra setting.

&gt;#5. It's a complex game

&gt;&gt;**seeQer11** Read the Test Outfit Field Manual and search around r/planetside!! Also watch youtube how to videos as the game can be very overwhelming with what your objectives are at the start. Lastly

&gt;&gt;**RoyAwesome** Play with others. This is an MMO that drops you from orbit into the end game on day 1 (literally). Join the reddit outfit (Vanu Sovereignty on Mattherson)

&gt;&gt;**badgerhax** It really is important that you find a group to play with. But there are also a lot of different things that an individual can do in the game. Earlier today I was sneaking into enemy air towers to blow up their esf's when they landed for repairs. Its all about finding what in the game you like doing. Maybe you like being sneaky and disruptive. maybe you like being a bus driver.

&gt;&gt;**ArcFault** JOIN AN OUTFIT!! If you are lone-wolfing in this game or just playing with a few friends you are missing out on more than 50% of this game. The first time you participate in a massive armor column

&gt;#6. Thanks for your time

&gt;&gt;**seeQer11** Looking to get into the game but not sure where to start? Join the official outfit over at r/testoutfit

&gt;&gt;**RoyAwesome** The game is free to play, keep an eye on this subreddit for when that patch goes out.

&gt;&gt;**badgerhax** I'm just glad this game is as popular as it it and I hope for its continued growth and improvement. We have a great community and I am glad to be a part of it.

&gt;&gt;**ArcFault** I am going to take this opportunity to comment on r/Planetside. We have a great community that has maintained a high level of discourse even through our population explosion after the game launched. I attribute this to the community supporting our basic posting rules that encourage intelligent discussion and discourage memes, including their CEO and Creative Director, but they are extremely receptive to feedback. Supporting SOE is an easy decision for me.

Membrane......ewww. You know when you hear a word and it just makes you squirm? Actually Squirm is another word that makes me squirm...weird. 

What are you typing on right now? You might be on your phone

[One day a long time ago](http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/?page_id=1329) someone decided to violate all the principles of the known universe by making a cheaper keyboard using membrane (shudder) switches rather than the incumbent mechanical switch. This lead to a mass exodus from mechanical switches by manufacturers who only cared about the aesthetics and cost of the keyboard, which allows the typist to reduce strain on their fingers by avoiding the membrane keyboards requirement of ""bottoming out"" on the keystroke, also [reducing the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome](http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/?page_id=1458) due to over exertion.

Lately mechanical keyboards have been making a comeback in the market

/r/MechanicalKeyboards is the reddit hangout for the lost children of typing

I decided to speak with the mod team to find out what makes this subreddit **CLICK.**

&gt; What is your mechanical keyboard background? What kind of board do you use now?

&gt;&gt;**ripster55:** The moderator team has used mechanical keyboards while most of our subscribers were zygotes. StlnItln was one of the original founding members of Geekhack. I used them back in the day when almost ALL keyboards were mechanical and got back into them after reading about the [IBM Model M one day at Dan's Data](http://www.dansdata.com/ibmkeyboard.htm) and buying a Das Keyboard as my first mechanical back in 2008 BEFORE mechanical keyboards went mainstream.

&gt;&gt;This is being typed on a Filco Brown Cherry MX but I rotate in new keyboards almost weekly.

&gt; What is your dream keyboard and setup?

&gt;&gt;**ripster55:**  Don't have one. I dream about women. Although I WILL say mechanical keyboards ARE sex for fingers. At /r/mechanicalkeyboards/ we don't answer questions like ""What Keyboard Do I Get"" or ""What Is The BEST Keyboard For Starcraft"" because your fingers aren't like mine. Or at least I hope not. My knuckles are a bit hairy. We supply reviews, KEYBOARD SCIENCE, and other CONTENT that allows people to decide for themselves what keyboard to get. Warning, [MANY of our members have multiple keyboards.](http://www.reddit.com/tb/10gpi5)

&gt; What do you think of cool boards like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/DzzAi.jpg) by /u/IntenseOCN?

&gt;&gt;**ripster55:** The new trend is to buy keyboards and then customize the keyboard with new keys. Personally I like plain keyboards with just a small splash of color but /r/mechanicalkeyboards features some great creative keyboards. [Like THIS one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/11byaf/shes_a_beaut/)

&gt;&gt;If you have a mechanical keyboard post your keyboard to get a big WELCOME at our Mechanical Keyboard Club. Doesn't have to be fancy. It's a place to share your keyboard enthusiasm and educate others. We even have cookeys. And bad puns. ಠ_ಠ

&gt; What type of game do you think most benefits from the player using a mechanical keyboard?

&gt;&gt;**ripster55:** Can't say. I don't game much. If you look at this [poll of our membership you'll see a WIDE diversity of mechanical keyboard users.](http://www.reddit.com/tb/10gpi5) ANYbody that uses a keyboard all day for programming or typing benefits from mechanical keyboards. Frankly the number one reason the gaming keyboard market is taking off because of StarCraft players switching to them and a relentless push of gaming keyboard manufacturers to raise the average selling price of their keyboards by touting mechanical switch keyboards. Diehard writers and programmers have used mechanical keyboards for years because they are a professional tool for productivity.

&gt; Your sidebar is full of great info! Who is responsible for the subreddit's design and content?

&gt;&gt;**ripster55:** To be honest I don't find many readers read the sidebar so am looking forward to the new Reddit Wiki tab for our subreddit. Now the DESIGN is an interesting note. StlnItln did that with just a BIT of help from our friends at /r/imageprocessing/. You should have SEEN how crappy my taste and CSS skills were. Let me say Helvetica and VAG Rounded FTW!

&gt; What is your favorite submission to /r/mechanicalkeyboards so far?

&gt;&gt;**ripster55:** I really liked [this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/11j20e/how_i_felt_after_buying_my_first_mechanical/) Kind of sums up why you should head over to /r/mechanicalkeyboards/. A typical BBS style keyboard forum is pretty boring and tends to be filled with serious epeen. We try to keep it a bit looser and focused on the fun part of keyboards!

&gt; 7) Got any shout outs? 

&gt;&gt;**ripster55:** Big shoutouts to my mom...my dog... frankly to make a subforum click is a combination of luck and hard work by the moderators AND content submitters. I especially thank ItlnStln for backing me up in good times and bad and PlasticChair for volunteering to help spread the word of mechanical keyboards! And any switch YOU like is the BEST switch. Any keyboard YOU like is the BEST keyboard.",self,t5_2sgno,1351224711.0,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/123viz/october_26_2012_rmechanicalkeyboards_i_use_one_at/

[Who doesn't love rabbits?](http://i.imgur.com/9YrvUyj.jpg) They're sweet little furballs with [unique personalities](http://i.imgur.com/N8LPfwu.png), and so long as you [know where to handle them](http://i.imgur.com/x4LTENI.png), they'll happily [love you forever](http://i.imgur.com/3RM4N8e.jpg).

Despite a sterling reputation in popular media (think [Velveteen Rabbit](http://i.goldstar.com/gse_media/112/9/velveteen-rabbit-100312.jpg?q=30&amp;h=520&amp;w=920), rabbits have gotten a bit of flack from some [for being destructive and unloving](http://www.mindspring.com/~tbgray/rabbits.htm). 

Some of this stems from people getting [actual Easter Bunnies](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TIQJaKX-sKo/TbU5yse7QTI/AAAAAAAAAAc/ODVh2F1Ki7o/s1600/easter-rabbits-wallpaper.jpg) for their kids, and so after Easter passes, many of those poor rabbits [end up in shelters](http://www.rabbitrescue.com/shelterpens.jpg) or [dead](http://www.alop.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/save-a-bunny1.jpg). 

Bunnies also have a [need to chew and wear their teeth down](http://m.gmgrd.co.uk/sbres/129.$plit/C_67_article_2058904_body_articleblock_0_bodyimage.jpg?14%2F10%2F2009%2011%3A53%3A55%3A386), like these ""vines"" ](http://petside.co.uk/petsideblog/2010/09/22/Rabbit_Chewing.jpg) to take care of themselves.

Rabbits also need [lots of exercise](http://i.imgur.com/85l9k.jpg) to stay fit and healthy

But in all seriousness, [without small children](http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/xx_factor/2012/06/14/choosing_to_be_child_free_there_are_other_kinds_of_babies_/1339693532623.jpg.CROP.article250-medium.jpg), and with enough free time[ to bond with them](http://s4.hubimg.com/u/115947_f260.jpg). For those people, [rabbits can be their best buddies](http://i.imgur.com/zYGm4.jpg) and [quiet companions](http://i.imgur.com/Mc0TH.jpg). 

/r/rabbits is a sub where such bunny people gather to share pics of their little furballs [hamming it up](http://i.imgur.com/9HRZ1.jpg)

The /r/rabbits community is very [friendly and well-versed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/1b8cwr/what_are_the_downsides_to_owning_a_rabbit/) in all things about rabbits. You'd be hard pressed to find a more relaxed and low key community of this size. 

However, or breed their rabbits, the subreddit's sidebar carries a special warning, discouraging posts about such practices due to the controversy surrounding them. There have also been instances where [breeders have apparently shared stories about culling and eating rabbits](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/18eaqu/some_thoughts_on_rabbit_care_and_this_subreddit/), and such posts are now outright banned.

But enough about such negativity! Let get back to what makes this sub great: [cute bunny gifs](http://i.imgur.com/ZIgNu.gif) and the sub's mod

&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/rabbits?

&gt;&gt;**sketchampm** My name is Matt and I started r/rabbits because I noticed there was no rabbit community on reddit

&gt;2.Do you own any rabbits of your own? If so

&gt;&gt;**sketchampm** I have had two rabbits. My first one was tulip. She was a grey lop that was pushed on to me by friends who rescued her and didn't have time to care for her. I did tons of research on the internet and learned a great deal about rabbit care and how to get a loving and responsible companion out of your rabbit. Sadly

&gt;&gt;Tulip: http://imgur.com/a/qdCLX

&gt;&gt;Honey: http://imgur.com/a/xNDiP 

&gt;3.Why do you think rabbits are so misunderstood?

&gt;&gt;**sketchampm**  Rabbits have represented different things to different cultures throughout history. They've been seen as pests

&gt;&gt;Rabbits don't offer their affection as quickly as a dog or a cat. Their trust must be earned through constant attention and gentle affection. They need at least two hours of exercise outside of their living space as well. Through a good diet and proper care, they lick your face to show appreciation, they flop over when completely content. 

&gt;&gt;This is why I created the sub- not only to give people a space to share cute pictures and ask questions

&gt;4.Your sub has grown into quite a large community over the past 3 years (8k as of this interview). How do you manage to moderate it all by yourself?

&gt;&gt;**sketchampm**  It's a lot hard work and behind-the-scenes management, has been a very helpful and active member and one of my ""approved"" posters.

&gt;5.I see that rule 7 is warning posters that they will potentially be criticized for bathing/trancing/breeding their rabbits. Has their been drama in the past concerning such topics?

&gt;&gt;**sketchampm**  Yeah

&gt;6.Is there anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**sketchampm** I just want to thank everyone for their subscriptions

Today's title comes to us directly from redditor [_Uatu_](http://www.reddit.com/user/_Uatu_) from his awesome comment in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dg0yw/how_can_i_start_not_giving_a_fuck_about_what/c0zxurh).  Additionally

****

Welcome to Subreddit of the Day.  We are truly a humble collective who challenge ourselves each day to present interesting subreddits to the better looking members of the reddit community.  That's you!  We take this task quite seriously and try to bring the awesome in a way that's both entertaining and informative.  Truly

If you're a semi-regular visitor here, living in different locations like Texas or Dublin, the moderators here couldn't be more different.  However, as diverse as we may be, we all somehow managed to subscribe to the notion that it's only reddit, and at no time should we take ourselves too seriously.  And here's the thing:  take the job seriously, but don't take yourself seriously.  I mean, mud on a pig's dick.  

So when presented with the challenge of featuring HTNGAF, visit a seniors home, whip it out and work on my ball technique?  *""Hey granny, how are ya with the ol' pinch n' roll?""*  Eat spaghetti with my hands?  Blow my nose on the curtains?  No problemo, I can *not* give a fuck with the best of them! 

I mean sure this all sound like fun, [/r/howtonotgiveafuck](/r/howtonotgiveafuck).  I'll stop you right there and say, it's way more than what you think it might be. This community is philosophical, helpful and supportive.  The best I can describe it is it's like [/r/GetMotivated](/r/GetMotivated) with a laser-sharp mandate: teaching redditors how to spend less time thinking about what others are thinking about you.  What you'll also quickly learn is that the people here are beyond nice.  (I mean for a group bent on not giving fucks, they sure care about everyone!)  They have earned my early vote for Subreddit of the Year because this is where reddit comes from and where reddit is going.  Atheism?  IAMA's?  Pictures of cats?  Gone Wild?  Show me a significant corner of reddit and I'll show you redditors not giving a fuck.

I could try to explain it

&gt;Thank you so much for being today's feature.

&gt;&gt;First of all

&gt;And now for the most important question... why. Why should we give fewer fucks?

&gt;&gt;One should give fewer fucks because this results in sustained happiness and less suffering. Hopefully, he/she does not get upset when a friend eats all the marshmallows in his/her Lucky Charms.  Troubling matters like these occur regularly throughout the day, and can take a severe toll on one's mental health if one chooses to get upset over them.  Even more seemingly concerning issues such as losing a job seem trivial when compared to the inevitable disease and death that we will all one day experience.  Furthermore, the not giving a fuck philosophy empowers its followers to take life by the balls and do whatever it is that makes them happy without worrying over meaningless consequences and potential gossip.

&gt;But wait

&gt;&gt;Not giving a fuck is more than just doing what feels good.  It's about doing what you think is the right thing to do. Obviously, then you won't have to worry about ""what if"" you had tried.  If you can make a change to improve your life, then do it.  If you can't, then there is no use in worrying about it. Mindless attachment to fulfilling an unrealistic expectation always leads to misery.

&gt;So where do you draw the line? When do you cross over into the world of Not Giving Enough Fucks?

&gt;&gt;This is a hard question.  There is a continuum for where the line is to be drawn.  Some may choose to cry after losing a game of Starcraft.  Others may cry when their mother dies.  For the buddha

&gt;&gt;a) Young men with saggy pants &amp; bums hanging out - The honey badger is not concerned with the actions of others that do not affect him/her.  The honey badger recognizes that pants hanging below the waist offer no utility, counseling should be offered.

&gt;&gt;b) Parents who bring their 18 month olds to the movies - The honey badger should not be bothered, the honey badger would speak in a calm manner to a manager so that he can resolve the problem and/or offer a refund. 

&gt;&gt;c) People who make chewing noises - The honey badger does not have pet peeves. Should the honey badger be trying to concentrate

&gt;Since you have stopped giving fucks

&gt;&gt;When you fully accept the ""not giving a fuck"" attitude, the newly crowned Honey Badger goes straight up to the prettiest girl in sight without hesitation and gives absolutely no fucks if he is rejected.

&gt;Let's wrap it up with **Project Mayhem** and **Honey Badger of the Week**. What can you tell us about these great initiatives? Can you give us a Subreddit of the Day special sneak peek?

&gt;&gt;Project Mayhem was moderator noahdamus' great idea which was just initiated last week. It is a way of bringing together the community of Honey Badgers and offering challenges that test/improve our capacity of not giving a fuck. Furthermore, stories etc. to other like-minded redditors.  The Honey Badger of the Week award was also just initiated and its purpose was to inspire thoughtful and useful comments and posts in our subreddit.

As you are probably already well aware, [NSFW Gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/jj56p/august_15th_2011_rnsfw_gif_welcome_to_the_jungle/) that don’t even include any boobs. I mean What the Actual Fu-*Ahem* These are the Gifs who are forced out in the cold, struggling to find shelter, hopeless and forgotten. Endlessly wandering the internet in search of a use or purpose but on the hard streets of the internet Gifs can get beat up, they become injured, sick or otherwise violated. Their very natured has become corrupted and distorted. What was once a simple clip of [Andy describing “The Birds and Bees”](http://i.imgur.com/XtnDXZE.gif) becomes a tear in the very fabric of space-time, making a face not unlike one would make when [firing mah lazer!](http://rocketdock.com/images/screenshots/424px-SHOOP_kit.png) Thankfully and rather unsurprisingly Reddit does have a home for these Gifs, a place for them to belong and be celebrated. Yes

Now how does a Broken Gif become broken? Well to be honest I'm not actually sure. I like to think of it as one of the great mysteries of the universe

&gt;The GIFs themselves are fine

&gt;The distortion

So there you have it

&gt;## 1. What was the Broken Gif that encouraged you to start this SubReddit?
 
&gt;&gt; **m00sician** I'm actually now sure anymore, I just make one and call it brokengifs"". I know it's one of these gifs that was posted a year ago, I can't tell which one it was though.
 
&gt;## 2. What is your favourite Broken Gif?
 
&gt;&gt; **m00sician** I like this one a lot: http://i.imgur.com/3rSiFRM.gif

&gt;&gt; It's like falling into gods mouth. 

&gt;## 3. Is there any truly horrifying Broken Gifs?
 
&gt;&gt; **m00sician** Oh yes. Recently someone made a broken gif out of the bud dwyer suicide. It cuts into the glitch effect right before he pulls the trigger, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/lODyc.gif) and [this.](http://i.imgur.com/1zEzf.gif)
 
&gt;## 4. Your subscribers do realise it's /r/brokengifs and not /r/brokengifsandvideos right? I've been seeing a few videos. ಠ_ಠ

&gt;&gt; **m00sician** Broken gifs and ""broken videos"" actually go hand in hand. When I first saw a gif that was glitched like the ones that are posted in brokengifs I just thought ""hey, so the actual name should've been ""brokenvideos"". I then decided that videos are okay as well, yet gifs are preferred. The ironic thing is that these gifs aren't actually broken and real broken gifs don't actually get a lot of upvotes there.
 
&gt;## 5. Continuing on from that
 
&gt;&gt; **m00sician** Users on the brokengif subreddit are usually looking for gifs that show morphed and glitched video sequences. The better it morphs together, nor glitched/morphed. Gifs like these get usually downvoted, so I barely have any actual work here, which is kinda cool.
 
&gt;## 6. Got anything to say to your community?
 
&gt;&gt; **m00sician** I'm surprised that this subreddit actually grew to the size it currently is and I'm pretty happy that there’s almost a daily contribution,False,self,t5_2sgno,1367175337.0,,WRITER,t3_1d9i9x

####This subrredit will break you.

If you go here half heartedly you will come out as a different person. I'm telling you right now

Just when you think you're safe from ""Why did I click that horrible wtf subreddit"", and pure comedy gold subreddits in a long time. I already warned you once, if you got the guts and the willpower go forth and see what /r/ImGoingToHellForThis holds, give it a try. I wouldn't be disappointed if you skipped it. Everyone is different. Everyone's ""offensive"" level is different. But man oh man can they hit right where it hurts. Basically, its a daily non-stop onslaught of things that will make you feel bad yet are extremely hilarious. A horrible horrible guilty pleasure. I'd avoid putting it on your resume.

They usually go after recent events for that extra special first class ticket to hell. So as you'd expect most of the newest jokes / memes / self posts are about the DKR Aurora shooting. In such tragic times some might say laughter cures all sadness. While uptight folks may consider it too fucking soon. We all have different methods in [**dealing with lose &amp; pain.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiaxzBlFgmQ) I'm not a religious man

/r/ImGoingToHellForThis lives on the edge of sanity and barbarianism of the written word. And the emotional dead side of me loves it. What can I say

I'm sorta dreading asking the mods questions

**[Inside the writers workshops]** Many of the writers for /r/SROTD skipped / ignored this subreddit. Not I, please keep sending in those [subreddit nominations](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23subredditoftheday&amp;subject=Subreddit%20Nomination) in the mod mail! We love you long time.

If there's one thing that redditors hate it's Internet censorship. Just check the front page of any number of subreddits and almost everyday you're bound to find at least one story about ISPs throttling bandwith

Thankfully

One such way might just be a project being spearheaded right now by a young man with a vision of a censorship free Internet owned and operated by the people. With new and scary sounding laws like SOPA constantly being brought up and debated in Congress

/r/darknetplan, it's not all just techno mumbo-jumbo: many of its readers also debate current laws, discuss general ideas, and look for help in learning how best they can participate.

I recently checked my pride at the door and interviewed cbresee

***

&gt;Can you give our readers a **tl;dr** version of the [basic introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qc-45mQjcs5ous-QxUMAk5bHuVrJLLSigzdWlTVTKIg/edit?pli=1) you have linked to on your sidebar?

&gt;&gt;**cbresee**: The Meshnet Plan’s vision is of establishing a new

&gt;The title of your /r/ is a bit confusing. Can you please explain why you're ""/r/darknetplan"" but your header calls you MeshNet?

&gt;&gt;**cbresee**: The Darknet Plan was the original name, change subreddits because of the potential loss of readers. However, both names are correct to use technically at this time.

&gt;Apparently you were [interviewed](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/11/23/wary-of-sopa-reddit-users-aim-to-build-a-new-censorship-free-internet/) by a reporter from Forbes.com. How surreal was it to be contacted by someone in the media regarding your subreddit and its goals? Can you walk us through exactly how that went down?

&gt;&gt;**cbresee**: It was a very surreal experience. The post in /r/technology that grew the subreddit from 3, a few of them interviews and one most notably from Andy Greenberg at Forbes. I have never been interviewed by anything bigger than a local paper so it was a different experience for sure.

&gt;Is there anything that the average

&gt;&gt;**cbresee**: At the moment

&gt;How does your team handle off-topic/spam/troll-ish posts? After all

&gt;&gt;**cbresee**: We have not removed any post from the subreddit nor do we plan to. It would be hypocritical of us to do so. We trust in the community to self-moderate through downvotes and upvotes. 

&gt;Let's face it: a totally anonymous, or commit other vile crimes?

&gt;&gt;**cbresee**: One thing I want to make clear is that the purpose for this network is not to commit crimes, and that some will attempt to use this network for ill purposes. The way I see it, these networks are tools and it is not the fault of the entire network if a few people use it for more sinister purposes. That said, I don’t think anyone truly committed to this idea would ever stand in the way of a legal investigation into crimes committed on the network, as long as it does not violate human and civil rights in any way. If people would like to talk to me more about my beliefs on privacy and civil and human rights, they are welcome to contact me but I feel like this answers getting a little long. 

&gt;Regarding my third question: who did the better interview? The guy from Forbes or me? 

&gt;&gt;**cbresee**: I have to say its hard to beat the response I received from Andy Greenberg when I told him I was actually 17 towards the end of the Forbes interview. Though this has been very well done. Thank you for this opportunity.

Thanks again to cbresee for the very enlightening interview. Thanks also to his fellow moderators jdiez17

**Item #:** SCP-1608-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to difficulties inherent in containing the subject, copy of subject is allowed on faster, transient storage can be allowed by Level 3 Personnel currently assigned to containement duty. ~~Access to the subject is restricted to personnel with level 2 clearance or greater.~~ Although the subject should ideally be inaccessible to the general population, the memetic properties of Subject when reviewed by untrained personnel has been deemed to be research-worthy. Under order of O5-█, Subject should thus be available for public viewing. However, no one under Level 2 clearance must be made aware of the subject's properties. Disclosure to unauthorized personnel by Foundation members will be corrected with use of a Class A Amnesiac to the former and termination of the latter.

Description: Subject is a digital representation of reality. It describes various phenomenons using diverse forms of media, Agents have reported symptoms ranging from slight apathy and distraction to heavy addiction. Experiment 1608-5 showed that personnel exposed to Subject for an amount of time as low as fifteen (15) minutes felt compelled to contribute to its storage of historical data. Caution must be exercised in such cases, as some subjects will attempt to submit accounts that are factually incorrect, either knowingly or due to faulty memory recall. Such subjects should be warned that their conduct is unacceptable, but should *never* be made aware of real reason for this rejection. That is, to comply with containement procedures, they must not realize that currently accepted data has been integrated in Subject because of its accuracy. Instead

- The account's narrative style does not fit with accepted norms;  
- The account contradicts previously known data;  
- The account has already been submitted and refuted
- The account regards the termination of [SCP-682](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682)

**Addendum 1608-J-1:** To anyone trying to make more people aware of Subject ""since the public is allowed to view it, our stock of Class A amnesiacs isn't infinite, and it would *really* be a *shame* to need to upgrade to Class C just because some [REDACTED] Class D decided to tell all of his friends about this.  
~ Dr. G██

**Interview 1608-J-A:**

**Interviewed:** ElXGaspeth (AKA Dr. Kens) and Nivek12
**Interviewer:** Dr. G██  
**Date:** ██-██-████  
**Location:** [DATA EXPUNGED]  

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

&gt;##1. How did you discover the SCP Foundation?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** I discovered the SCP Community after looking through several Unity game examples. Then I found the SCP-087 game which lead to the wiki and finally to this subreddit.  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** I found it roughly four years ago in a link on Reddit, and applied the next day. Got in, and have been a part ever since.

&gt;##2. What is your favorite SCP?
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** Can I say most of them? I kid, never to be able to return.

&gt;##3. I take it you've written/contributed to at least a couple... Which one of those are you the proudest of?
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** I only wrote one - [SCP-922](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-922)

&gt;##4. What is your biggest pet peeve when people write SCPs?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** That people believe all SCP articles need a sterile/clinical tone or must have every single detail explained. I find myself liking Foundation Tales more because they build a world in the reader's mind by using imaginative descriptions that wouldn't fit in a formal document. The visual imagery in Foundation Tales can convey and trigger such a wide variety of thoughts. There exists a sweet spot between a blunt story and a vague jumble of words
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** My biggest pet peeve is the same as Nivek's, and SCP article must be a scary/creepy/terrifying."" They don't have to be in order to be a good read.
Oh

&gt;##5. Any other words for aspiring writers?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** I believe that writing an SCP article shouldn't only be about how mysterious or creepy of an idea the author can come up with (though those certainly are characteristics of the majority of good SCPs). The author should also consider the impact on the reader. I'd say a good SCP is one that instills a strong urge/desire in a reader such that they would be willing to join a large community of strangers and devote hours to interacting with others who have nothing in common except for the author's article. What good is an idea if no one shares it?  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** Don't be afraid to ask for help. The community is there to offer support and advice. Sometimes ridicule
And for God's sake, and basic grammar. And don't use those black boxes everywhere. Like a good perfume, they should be used sparingly, not bathed in.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 1608-J-2:** Ah, so please read standard procedure - *and follow it*. We've lost too many [REDACTED] to [DATA EXPUNGED] ever since Dr. ████████ and SCP-███ came along.

Someone once told me that sexuality is like pizza. There's a thousand combinations of pizza, Vegetarian... Meat Lovers. (Am I not above that pun?) We name pizza when it becomes popular enough to warrant an easy-to-remember title, but the rest of those combinations and materials are just as good. Though this puts me at odds with the idea; as an asexual, this would equate to me not liking pizza, which is the opposite of true. Whatever. Sexuality comes in a full spectrum of light. Some you can see, others you can't. I still have no idea what half of them mean (tridimensional pantheon cross second-degree tromosexual), but it's easy to figure out if you deal with it every day. Although not all of them have quick and easy names to remember, they're all good.

I first discovered /r/ainbow a long ways back when it was new, who is an active participant there. I checked it out and, would you guess, it was friggin' awesome. Close to 20,000 members and the front page was swamped with nothing but quality content. The comments section proved to be identical, actually boasting intelligent and well-written discussions. This is a big deal on Reddit. To end a paragraph: If every subreddit had a community like /r/ainbow, reddit would be a shining example of internet communities.

You're in luck, but it does raise questions. How am I supposed to format it? /r/ainbow works for me, but it looks strange. /r/Ainbow looks even stranger! There's no middle ground. /R/ainbow?

Back on the topic of today's feature, but socially, they're coming close to the equal-rights singularity. That's what I'd want to say, anyway. You're forgetting a quarter (1/5th?) of that term. The T. Now, I don't hope to understand what transgendered people go through, because I don't even get what sexual people go through. Yet, I know that they're people like me, involving the letters of LGBT climbing out of a pit. When LGB got to the top

All people, how they feel, or who they love, deserve to be treated the same way. This goes beyond sexuality, of course, and I can even reference my own struggle for gaining rights as a schizophrenic in this case. They used to just lock us up and throw away the key. Now they only lock *some* of us up, and they key remains in possession.

Here at Subreddit of the Day, and they're more than appropriate to be called today's Subreddit of the Day.

Here to honor that

&gt;#1. I'd like to start this in a new way. Describe your subreddit in one sentence.

&gt;&gt;**JoeyCastillo** /r/ainbow: one year old

&gt;&gt;**Jess_than_three** /r/ainbow is a friendly, operating on a model of community moderation that allows its users to decide what content is valuable vs. what's unwanted or offensive.

&gt;#2. You're all multicolored people

&gt;&gt;**JoeyCastillo** I'm a Texan by birth living in New York. First joined reddit to follow news on /r/LGBT two years ago. I was working on my master's report

&gt;&gt;**TrendyClockwork** I am originally from Iowa

&gt;&gt;I started regularly visiting the /r/gaymers (of which I also now mod) ventrilo server where I met Joey
&gt;&gt;
Personally

&gt;&gt;**Jess_than_three** I'm never sure how to answer these sorts of questions! I'm a bisexual (or pansexual, and when I'm not doing reddit stuff my life is largely consumed by work and taking care of an adorable, incredibly bratty baby. I have a problematic propensity for walls of text, and my favorite pie is strawberry rhubarb.

&gt;&gt;**Synspark** I'm mike. I'm a web developer in the Metro NYC area. I'm not an activist, and it's because of a community that's thoughtful, generally kind, and super-active. The awesome othermods (a captain planet-esque team of superheroes) really help everything run smoothly, and I count among them some of the people who are nearest to me personally.

&gt;&gt;To the /r/ainbow community... It's been an excellent year, and we continue to make it work. Thanks for that :)

&gt;&gt;**d_anio** Joey pretty much I think covered all of these questions wonderfully with his wall of text. &lt;3

&gt;&gt;I would add that i have met people I would consider to be my closest friends through the community here on reddit Thats what makes r/ainbow more then just an online formum for me.
Im Daniel. From Reno NV just moved out to the San Francisco area for work late last year. Im an avid cyclist and snowboard/skate when I find the time. I also game a lot and try to read at least one book every month. I just picked up anno 2070 (sim city like game) and am rereading lullaby by Chuck Palahnuik.
I came out as gay when I was about 17. I came out as left handed when I was about 6 and I'm still in the closet about being dyslexic. And what else.

&gt;&gt;I'm drunk its my birthday week so stop asking so many questions and go away. &lt;3

&gt;#3. What makes Rainbow different from the other LGBT subs?

&gt;&gt;**JoeyCastillo** /r/ainbow has the coolest name, /r/gaybros, /r/actuallesbians, /r/bisexual, /r/transgender and the like all have distinctive communities that can be a really positive influence for people. Recently I met a person here in NYC, mid-20s, who's just coming out of the closet; it was one of these communities that helped him gain the confidence to do it.

&gt;&gt;So yeah, it's mainly /r/LGBT and us.

&gt;&gt;/r/LGBT aims to be a safe space for GSM folks, we just kind of roll with the punches, try to keep things respectful and trust people to hash it out on their own. At times, moderating the place [can feel a bit like this](http://i.imgur.com/GBoNV.gif); but the payoff is when something clicks for someone, when a conversation that takes place here changes a mind or moves a heart. It happens, fairly often actually, and it's one of the positive things that I think we're uniquely equipped to do here.

&gt;&gt;**Jess_than_three**Joey really nailed it with the difference between /r/lgbt and /r/ainbow, a mod message is posted; that's it. That's very appropriate for that type of space, where the goal is to protect your community's members from having to deal with offensive stuff, but I think one of the strengths of /r/ainbow is that we let those discussions happen - someone can come in, say a terrible thing, and then have several people explain to them why it was terrible, why they're wrong about all of the everything, maybe someone else reading along does. And I think there's value in leaving those heavily-downvoted

&gt;&gt;It's also worth pointing out that although /r/ainbow was created as an alternative to /r/lgbt, as moderators of either sub, are pretty happy that both places exist, to meet the needs of people who prefer either approach.

&gt;#4. What's your community like? Describe it.

&gt;&gt;**JoeyCastillo** I like to think that the /r/ainbow community is certainly extremely diverse; in fact we have [some data points on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/xgv6t/announcement_13000_readers_and_the_results_of_the/). More broadly I think the /r/ainbow community is thoughtful and intelligent

&gt;#5. Anything else you'd like to say to the audience?

&gt;&gt;**JoeyCastillo**  I feel like I'm already over my word count so I'll leave it at this: reddit is at its best when people use it to create communities that they want to be a part of

Picking up randomers in dark nightclubs will probably always be a bit of a gamble

/r/politicalfactchecking is a subreddit dedicated to checking up on the claims of all your favourite and not-so-favourite politicos. From Clinton to Romney

Here are mods NewAccts

&gt;## What was the impetus behind the creation of /r/politicalfactchecking?

&gt;&gt; **timothyjchambers:** Maybe everybody thinks this but this election feels more Colbert-like post-truth “truthiness than ever. At the same time traditional media seems to be doing a suckier job than ever at being a true watchdog to good and bad political fact claims. And we saw that in early embryonic ways massive “crowdsourced” fact checking seemed to be already starting to happen on Twitter and Reddit, more dependable political claims that have some basis in reality -- And to help disprove the junk.  

&gt;&gt; **NewAccts:** I absolutely agree what timothyjchambers said. It was happening organically, but in some cases I've seen those posts being ignored by a large number of users. Seeing that, and realizing those posts needed more attention, I jumped at the chance to participate when Timothyjchambers proposed it. I feel that crowd sourced fact checking is going to only get larger, and is an extension of independent journalism that the internet is so useful for. It serves a dual purpose. Not only do facts get checked, but the users themselves learn a good deal about the issues and subtleties of those issues when they contribute to fact checking. I hope this will result in a more informed number of voters

&gt;## How do you deal with any issues of partisan bias?

&gt;&gt; **timothyjchambers:** We allow anyone of any political view to post any US political fact claim. But we specifically do NOT vet arguments, we as mods specifically chose folks who really care about facts and verifying reliably sourced data - and we all come from different points on the political spectrum ourselves.

&gt;&gt; **nandryshak:** I would like to say that all our mods are great, and personally I think that's the only way to get good content in a controversial reddit, such as a political one, or in a large reddit. I think they are all good people, and they do their job well.

&gt;## Are you active in politics in the real world outside of reddit?

&gt;&gt; **timothyjchambers:** Yep. I’ll let the other mods chime in

&gt;&gt; **NewAccts:** Somewhat. I've done volunteer canvassing in the past. I would like to volunteer for a campaign in the 2014 Gubernatorial elections

&gt;&gt; **nandryshak:** I guess I am active with politics, and their alternatives. I do some ""fact-checking"" when I have to. I can't stand when people argue with things that you would read out of a tabloid. I have a Jill Stein t-shirt and a sticker on my car. I haven't been officially associated with any campaigns (yet).

&gt;## So far

&gt;&gt; **timothyjchambers:** So far we’ve handled everything thorny issues like abortion funding, and prior to any of the official fact check orgs were seriously digging in, our users were already there, finding original source material to link to, and sussing through and vetting what was verifiably real.

What I do remember is Strong Bad's hilarious e-mails and Strong Sad being very...sad. And of course ""Jarb"". I still use the word sometimes in public. Sometimes I get the ""ma nigga"" head tilt and smile. Other times I get funny looks.

So anyway

You see

So mod /u/jaylow17 very graciously answered a few questions I had.

&gt;##1. Like most people

&gt;&gt; **jaylow17** The site started in 2000 when Mike and Matt Chapman wanted to work on their flash skills so they used a children's book Mike created years earlier and animated it. They created other animations based off the same characters and threw it up on their website. The site really took off in 2001, a popular character, and he responding in a humorous and narrative way. The strong bad emails soon became a central feature of the site, spawning favorites like ""Powered by the Cheat"" flash videos and the epic ""Teen Girl Squad.""

&gt;##2. Who created this sub and why?

&gt;&gt; **jaylow17** This one I don't have such a great answer to. It was originally created by golg0than but when I stumbled across it, but didn't use r/homestarrunner. So I personally set out, [first as a user](http://www.reddit.com/r/HomestarRunner/comments/k4edw/this_is_the_saddest_reddit_ever_lets_not_mourn/) and [then as a mod](http://www.reddit.com/r/HomestarRunner/comments/pgesv/hey_rhomestarrunner_you_can_now_add_flair_to_your/), to make the subreddit active again, as a community to share our favorite parts of homestarunner, on the website and in real life. I'm proud to say we are an active community reaching almost 2000 members. Also, I have to give a shout-out to /u/canipaybycheck for being awesome in general and helping with the totally kick-ass CSS.


&gt;##3. What can we find at /r/homestarrunner?

&gt;&gt; **jaylow17** At /r/homestarrunner you can find discussion about the plot and characters, and links to homestarrunner.com that have been long forgotten. It's a catch-all for anything related to homestarrunner and it has some really fun and interesting content.

&gt;##4. Who's your favorite character and why?

&gt;&gt; **jaylow17** My favorite has to be Strong Mad, strong, and angry exterior, but really, on the inside he's got a big heart. He's the cheat's best friend and is a stark contrast to his brother, Strong Bad's, meddling ways. Also

&gt;##5. How hopeful are you that 'homestarrunner.net it's dot com' will start posting videos again?

&gt;&gt; **jaylow17** It's interesting you brought that up. While some are a bit more [depressed](http://www.reddit.com/r/HomestarRunner/comments/rnzp3/haha_the_april_fools_joke_this_yer_is_brilliant/) and [defeatist](http://www.reddit.com/r/HomestarRunner/comments/jf70r/the_brothers_chaps_got_new_jobs/) about the whole situation, so no one is expecting anything (or should be expecting anything), but many, including myself, are cautiously optimistic.",,False,t5_2sgno,True

Oh, when described, must contain the word ""Halo"" somewhere. I bought Combat Evolved on launch and kept the pattern for 2 and 3. Late nights of each, moving forward unto dawn in pursuit of that blessed last game of the night. Though, it was more than that. Halo was a big experience for me. In 2001, in college, I had finally gained enough money that I could afford my own console. No more hogging my brother's Playstation for me. No sir, with the help of my roommates

Halo for me doesn't just mean ""pewpewpew"" to me, with a gun in his hand and a world under his feet. These are the memories that Halo has given me.

Though I've moved on to full-time PC gaming, and the people behind it. I could write a book on my time at HiH, HBO, and BNet alone.

But I know that this article has to end eventually, as usual, an interview.

&gt;#1. Howdy

&gt;&gt;**EagleBurn** I like Halo

&gt;&gt;**Kettlecorn** Hi

&gt;&gt;**MattyMcD** First off I would like to say we are all huge fans of the Halo series. Everything about it from the lore to the online multiplayer. Halo has always been my ""go to"" game when it comes to having a great time with friends. When I'm not moderating /r/halo I am a Professional Compositor for film and television or ""Visual Effects Artist"".

&gt;&gt;**OpTic_Niko** I'm new here so I don't really know much about the other moderators just yet :( So far they've been very nice to me! They're always there to help me out with any questions I may have, and I'm pretty happy that I can now give back to the series that has helped me so much in life. Back in my teenage years I used to be that shy kid in school that always spent his time playing video games, and of course I got made fun of it for being a 'no-life.' When Halo 3 came around I was known around high school as the Halo kid, and that actually got me some unnecessary popularity around school. The majority of the Halo players in my school always came up to me if they needed any assistance with the Halo games, and it really helped my self-esteem over the years that I was always the go to guy for anything Halo related :) The random popularity has helped me gain plenty of life-long friends, and I really think I wouldn't be the person I was today if it wasn't for Halo...

&gt;#2. What's it like moderating such a huge group of gamers?

&gt;&gt;**EagleBurn** It's great and can be overbearing at times. We do our best to stick by our rules and promote civil discussion. There are lots of opinions out there

&gt;&gt;**Kettlecorn** It's a bit tricky. All sorts of people are really into Halo

&gt;&gt;**MattyMcD** I started moderating /r/halo a few months after EagleBurn was signed on as mod so far it's been great the community is surprisingly well behaved considering how vocal and *passionate some people can be about Halo.

&gt;&gt;**OpTic_Niko** I've actually been having a lot of fun moderating /r/halo! I've only been a moderator for a month now, the Sherlock Holmes of r/halo, Batman, and some have even called me the moderator of the year :) Thank you for all the nice compliments! I have something nice planned for all of you soon &lt;3

&gt;#3. If you were to give one tip to a new (or returning) player

&gt;&gt;**EagleBurn** Halo is known for it's multiplayer as much as it's single-player

&gt;&gt;**Kettlecorn** To enjoy the Halo series to its fullest you've got to take part in the community. Look up some community game types and maps to check out what other people are playing!

&gt;&gt;**MattyMcD** My tip for returning players is to get used to change. Halo is a series that has never stayed still in terms of it's gameplay. You can never get tied down to one game. You can take the tactics and things you have learned in terms of core strategies but nostalgia trips will always let you down.

&gt;&gt;**OpTic_Niko** My best tip is don't die! (Just kidding) Whenever you're playing matchmaking

&gt;#4. How has the community changed since the announcement of Halo 4? For better or worse?

&gt;&gt;**EagleBurn** Before Halo 4 released

&gt;&gt;/r/halo has definitely improved since before Halo 4 launched. We are now in the beginning of starting up our 2nd /r/halo tournament and other community events to make the place feel even smaller. We're always coming up with ways to improve the subreddit and will continue doing so.

&gt;&gt;**Kettlecorn** The /r/halo community has exploded since the announcement and release of Halo 4. We've doubled(maybe even tripled) in size since Halo 4 was announced. We've been through our ups and downs

&gt;&gt;**MattyMcD** Like I said the community is very passionate. I would say say it has changed for the better and with the release of Halo 5 we can only get bigger right?

&gt;&gt;**OpTic_Niko** I actually think it has changed for the better. Halo 4 gave us a massive influx of players to our subreddit, and it could get pretty heated at times. It has gotten a lot better now! The creators of the Halo series (343 Industries) has been listening to community feedback, and they're actually bringing in the changes we want in a future title update and they have also been listening to which sort of maps we would want to see in future DLCs.

&gt;#5. Thanks again

&gt;&gt;**EagleBurn** Pepsi is flat Coke.

&gt;&gt;**Kettlecorn** The /r/halo subreddit isn't only for long-time Halo fans. If you're just getting started with the Halo series feel free to stop by!

&gt;&gt;**OpTic_Niko** My best friend is a fellow Redditor so in case you see this

####Breaking News:

Sorry for the very late SROTD. We are currently having technical difficulties. Please stand by while I write something meaningful **LIVE ON THE AIR.** /u/LGBTerrfic has been missing for 7 days. Also I heard the bay harbor butcher is in town. I doubt there is any coincidence. Right? RIGHT?

In honor of the beginning of Season 7 of Dexter

Go watch this show! Its quality is right up there with the best of them. I swear. The Wire, Firefly are shows of equal caliber. The first two seasons of Dexter are so good, so well written it will keep you up at night. I accidentally started watching this show at 1am on a weekday. I had to take the next 2 days off because I had to see what was going to happen next. If Dexter were a drug it would be cocaine+crack+meth all in one.

There are many characters you can relate to, *Debra*. The hardass lady in charge with her own agenda, *Maria Laguerta*. I Sgt. with family problems to say the least, *Angel Batista*. Expert blood splatter analyst by day, murderer by night *Dexter*. See you can related to everyone! SUPERMOTHERFUCKER *James Doakes*, you think I'd honestly forget Doakes?

The basic jest of the show is that Dexter had a really horrible childhood. So now as an adult he kills bad people. Most times he is the good guy. Most times. The thing about this show is that it loves being in that gray area of good and bad. No one is perfect. But this show highlights it.

Season 7 airs tonight at 9. Have your popcorn ready. Full disclaimer

&gt;#1. How did you get into Dexter?

&gt;&gt;**edify** I'm not sure who it was that told me about Dexter

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider** A friend mentioned it to me via AIM at midnight

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** I was looking for an interesting show and a good friend of mine suggested that I watched Dexter. I got through all 5 seasons that were released in about 3 or 4 days.

&gt;&gt;** **

&gt;#2. Whats your favorite episode?

&gt;&gt;**edify** The season one finale. I love the ending.

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider** This is a tough one. If I had to pick

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** Season Finale of Season 4...oh god.

&gt;&gt;** **

&gt;#3. Out of all the people Dexter has killed

&gt;&gt;**edify** In season 6 Dexter kills a gang member played by Breaking Bad's Luis Moncada. Gotta show my love for that guy!

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider** Miguel Prado. Fuck Miguel Prado.

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** When one of the men that killed his mother. Such great acting from Michael C. Hall in that scene.

&gt;&gt;** **

&gt;#4. Season 7 is about to start tonight

&gt;&gt;**edify** Sure am. I'm really excited to see how last seasons cliff hanger plays out.

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider** [Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUjh9Id6Id8) yeah!

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** Well

&gt;&gt;** **

&gt;#5. End Game question: In the end what do you think will happen to Dexter &amp; Debra? Will they go by the book or take a different angle?

&gt;&gt;**edify** We'll just have to see what they come up with in the writers room ;)

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider** It would be cool if they did something different. I can't say what but I want a new experience. And hopefully the series to end with a big bang.

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** Debra will keep quiet about it and have an internal struggle

To expect the unexpected is to expect anything from anything. Whether you can call a coin flip as it's in the air, I've distanced myself from classical music in favor of shuffle. [Gunther's Ding Ding Dong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbYtqAWDF2U) sound beautiful on my audio setup. Enough about me, though, let's talk about something else.

How about that /r/Unexpected? I've gotten numerous requests in the past month or so to feature this beauty. It's the unexpected capital of reddit, knowing that its content changes drastically across every submission. But that's alright, we like a challenge.

/r/Unexpected is like /r/WhereDidTheSodaGo's insane counterpart. Walking to kitchen balancing popcorn and soda, but it's mostly the equation of (Stupid shit)+(Funny shit)=(This shit).  It's been done to death, to life again, and all the way around. The concept was old when the world was new, but so long as humans (and sometimes animals, but never plants) are stupid, it'll be funny.

That's about all I can say about that. Don't take my horrible writing as a warning sign. The greatest of things often find a bad home in writing. Words can't expect the unexpected.

I stood around the mods of /r/unexpected

&gt;#1. First

&gt;&gt;**vxx** I'm 30

&gt;&gt;**STORM_TROOPERS** I'm a 20 year old from Canada.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT** I'm an 18 year old male from 'murica. I enjoy moderating a lot.

&gt;#2. What's it like to mod r/Unexpected?

&gt;&gt;**vxx** It doesn't feel like modding a subreddit, because it has a high spam and bullshit resistance.

&gt;&gt;**STORM_TROOPERS** It's great. Not much to moderate the random spam post here and there. I really enjoy our subreddits community.

&gt;&gt; I think one of the other mods who moderate other subreddits can leave a word on that

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT** It's awesome! I get to see all the submissions before anyone else since I go through the new queue and approve all of them.

&gt;#3. Unexpected is quite active

&gt;&gt;**vxx** I drop the word from time to time when there is a fitting submission. Very carefully and not often

&gt;&gt;**STORM_TROOPERS** It's all on vxx. He does a great job growing this subreddit by posting our subreddit on any submission in other subreddits that would fit in perfectly here.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT** I've crossposted a few gifs and videos from here to other relevant subreddits with the name of the sub in the title to spread awareness of the subreddit.

&gt;#4. Do you have any favorite submissions? If so

&gt;&gt;**vxx** My absolutely favourite submission is [That's the last time...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/17inmu/thats_the_last_time_xpost_rdrugs/)

&gt;&gt;**STORM_TROOPERS** [This one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/19i0zh/simply_buying_some_condoms/) is by far my favourite.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT** [Just saw this one last night...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/1ealbn/breaking_into_the_pool_nsfw/)

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch

&gt;&gt;**vxx** I want to thank everyone who is subscribed and makes it the great and fun place that /r/unexpected is

&gt;&gt;**STORM_TROOPERS** Thank you for subscribing to our subreddit and I hope you enjoy the content posted and if you ever have any concerns or questions or just want to chat feel free to send us a mod mail! :)

Remember when you were in elementary school and someone would make a fat joke about one of the kids in class? Usually everyone would laugh except, too, while the poor kid fought back tears. But don't worry: that doesn't make you a bad person. You were, after all, only a child.

The average redditor likely swears that he or she would never do something like that again. S/He probably believes that he or she would *not only* not join in the laughter but would actually stand up for the victim

Redditors are like that. Overall we're a classy bunch that stands up for the little guy and celebrates heroes who take down bullies.

Alas, homophobic, and simply mean-spirited comments and posts made on reddit. What's more? These aren't comments that have been downvoted to oblivion. Instead, these are comments and posts that *actually received a lot of upvotes!* In other words, this a place that proves redditors can sometimes be as mature as the average YouTuber or XBox Live brat. Only one person may have made the offensive comment, of course, but the fact that it was upvoted so much proves that a lot of redditors cheered the offender on.

But there's [nothing wrong with being offended from time to time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycXuYzmzNg). When 99% of reddit-related front page stories are all pats on the collective hivemind's back for being as awesome as we are, such bullies and assholes aren't always chastised by the community. Sometimes they're even celebrated.

Recently I sat down to play *Crossfire: The Board Game* with Amrosorma, T2_, teefs, and HPLovecraft to debate SRS. Below is the best transcript I could decipher from the ensuing hours-long yelling-fest.

***

&gt;Explain like I'm 5: what is the purpose of /r/shitredditsays?

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: r/shitredditsays makes fun of all the terrible things that somehow manage to get upvoted on Reddit. From the private messages I’ve gotten from, homophobia, transphobia, and all the other lovely things upvoted on Reddit on a disturbingly frequent basis. Imagine a dude’s butt farting for all of eternity

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: We kept hearing that there was a shadowy cabal of feminist anti-White LGBT supremacists spreading political correctness across Reddit; it actually sounded like a pretty good idea so we went ahead and rolled with it. Towards this end, coordinate downvote squads, and stifle Rational Debate whenever we can.

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: WE ARE THE FEMBORG. YOU WILL BE EMASCULATED

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: To lead the SRS Schutzstaffel to Gynocratic Glory.

&gt;&gt;**teefs**: One word: Cryptohomofascism. (Heil Gay Hitler (but don’t tell anyone))

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: You’re not drunk enough for that information. Lemme kino you a bit more

&gt;Was there a particular comment and/or post that was upvoted so much that you felt you had to create /r/shitredditsays in order to vent about it? If so

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: Personally, shot by an “urban” flash mob, or all three.

&gt;&gt;But for real: like 6 months ago, went through his history, and found his “guess the Redditor” posts on SRS where he would take quotes from Stormfront and Reddit. You had to guess which was which (this was really fuckin hard). Sadly, reddit_sux went and found a better community about 9 months ago, leaving the subreddit in disrepair. Over the summer, when I was killing time at my internship, I just started submitting the best MRA shit I found to SRS. Around the same time

&gt;&gt;I remember one day I submitted a post that talked about how feminism’s primary goal was to maximize the number of alpha male penises they could get or some crazy bullshit like that

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: SRS was created by reddit_sux, and discovered SRS.

&gt;&gt;After reddit_sux left the subreddit went into a kind of limbo. It was eventually revived, particularly amongst the denizens of /r/MensRights.

&gt;&gt;Barry made me a mod so that I could do some CSS things. I've only really added some silly emoticons though.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: There is no venting on r/shitredditsays. It is all fuel for the gynocratic lizard overlord fire; these will be the tracts we read as we wage intergalactic war on the patriarchy and shatter the yoke of oppression on all non-straight/white/male humans through the thermal energy of straight white man foreskins burned in mass effigy.

&gt;&gt;**-T2_**: I really just like to mock people. And play with user flair. Flair is fun.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: I literally was just tapped to become mod because I destroyed r/jailbait with my kegels alone. You’re welcome.

&gt;&gt;But seriously

&gt;When I browse your /r/ I often find myself enraged and/or disappointed by the fact that so many offensive and stupid comments/posts can receive so many upvotes. However

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: As we are part of a deep cover feminist lizard-bodied individual conspiracy

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: First off, which is totally counterproductive to the general groove of SRS. If everything we link to gets -50 votes or whatever, it makes the fact that Reddit is pretty overtly hostile to anyone who is not a white straight male 1%er seem like less of a problem than it actually is.

&gt;&gt;More importantly, but if my goal was to make Reddit a better place, messing with peoples’ internet points would not be the centerpiece of my strategy, so a lot of the yelling about us being a shadowy cabal playing master of puppets with Reddit for some femi-lizard conspiracy falls flat (even though it’s actually true!)

&gt;&gt;My opinion has always been that I really do not give a shit what people's karma is and if people losing points because of /srs is a side effect of what we're doing

&gt;&gt;** T2_**: Quite simply, especially not if a comment has ~100+ upvotes. Another reason why we don't downvote brigade is because that de-legitimizes us in the minds of other redditors and reinforces a mob mentality.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: Barry and T2_ covered the whole bit about downvote brigades so I’d like to talk about the benefit of r/SRS to the Reddit community. It’s a place where anyone who is sick of how minority issues and discourse is generally treated on Reddit (with little understanding, but trolls and shit posters tend to get downvoted pretty hard. And yet, I somehow manage to sleep at night.  

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: It’s like a zoo. A zoo of poo. You don’t touch the poo.

&gt;In an ideal world

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: A HORSE 

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: SRS has to be the number one subreddit in a year’s time or it will objectively be a failure.

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: We need to be in the center of the greatest shitstorm Reddit has ever seen. It will last a thousand years and will bury the servers beneath the shitsands of pooptime.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: In the upcoming year, straight white man foreskin soup, and a moderate amount of revelry.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: NO BUT SERIOUSLY I WANT IT TO BE A HORSE SO I CAN RIDE IT TO AND FROM PLACES.

&gt;My mom knows my Reddit username and will probably read this writeup. In deference to her sensibilities

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and ONLY into White countries.

&gt;&gt;The Netherlands and Belgium are more crowded than Japan or Taiwan

&gt;&gt;Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY White country and ONLY white countries to ""assimilate, with all those non-Whites.

&gt;&gt;What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

&gt;&gt;How long would it take anyone to realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

&gt;&gt;And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn't object to this?

&gt;&gt;But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race

&gt;&gt;They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.

&gt;&gt;Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White.

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: I giggled a bit when I first read this comment, it has more impact than just saying ""Bad things"". It's us pointing out that what the user said is truly shit, that it is completely inappropriate and we are going to call them out on it. Whether it be racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, transphobia or any other form of discrimination

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: this is funny, because i have had sex with then given a fake identity to every redditor ever’s mom, but that said i’m really sorry that our name is a cuss i didnt pick it :\

&gt;&gt;i feel like “sometimes say” is sort of inaccurate tho, and typically, the people who call these posts out are downvoted into silence. at srs, they aren’t, and that’s nice.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: It is counterproductive, harass and silence us. They will continue to systematically marginalize us until the day when we are no longer a threat to them.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: Your mom actually browses reddit? I hope you disabled all of the large subreddits from her front page

&gt;Finally

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jn40u/this_ones_a_goldmine/ Because it really is.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: The entire series of “Reddit or Stormfront?” comparisons by reddit_sux; that’s what got most of us here in the first place: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/search?q=author%3Areddit_sux&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on - 

&gt;&gt;I also love that I_HAVE_CATS posts pictures of their cats in (nearly) every comment they make on r/SRS; they are My Favorite Poster.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: There’s too many to name. fxexular’s megaposts never disappoint; that dude is like a bloodhound for awful opinions. The fallout from the whole Anderson Cooper vs. /r/jailbait incident was pretty great too. Really anything that demonstrates how inappropriately important reddit is to redditors

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: Definitely this one: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jlqnk/white_people_why_do_you_name_your_kids_ridiculous/ Literally a day before this was posted

First off

Second off

I'm going to go ahead and say I don't.

Speaking of, but after one sip she dropped it on the floor. The bottle shattered, and we were all like [oh shit.](http://i.imgur.com/R0sOl.jpg) And my friend is all like [oh no](http://gifsoup.com/view/52419/dawson-crying-o.gif).

And then out of nowhere she goes [""Gotta save my beer!""](http://i.imgur.com/Uq9Vw.gif). Then she starts slurping up beer off the floor. And the rest of us are just thinking [""What the fuck is going on?""](http://i.imgur.com/6NCsB.gif).

We finally ended up getting her off the floor and went to dinner. And the rest of the night is a mystery.

Ok I lied

So back to shower beer. I'm going to have to try it. Soon. Probably right now after I write this up.

So now

&gt;##1. Explain to us the art of the shower beer.

&gt;&gt;**toat** Shower beers are something that cannot be explained with words as it would be an injustice to the sport. Most people report that the frostiness of an ice cold brew mixed with a steamy shower creates a dichotomy of pleasure that only the Romans would dare indulge in. But that is only the surface, some are fans of flavor pairing their shower beer with the soap they use. The possibilities are endless and the infinite ways to shower beer make it something that anyone can and should indulge in.

&gt;##2. When you're wet, what's your beer of choice?

&gt;&gt;**toat** It all depends, I once had a near death experience when my glass bottle of Yuengling slipped out of my hand and broke. Nothing ruins a shower beer like a broken bottle. That said, many people like to live on the edge and I do so myself from time to time but on the regular its just not worth the risk. I'm also more of an Alanis Morissette fan.

&gt;##3. What is an absolute no-no with shower beers?

&gt;&gt;**toat** There are no rules to shower beer, others go can, one guy even put a [kegerator in his bathroom](http://www.reddit.com/tb/z2nbg). Shower beers are about breaking rules and enjoying life, there aren't any no-nos here (except maybe not shower beering). Oh also, getting water in the beer really sucks, it's inevitable that some water will get in the beer, don't stress

&gt;##4. How did this place come about?

&gt;&gt;**toat** I started the sub last winter

&gt;##5. On that note

&gt;&gt;**toat** There are many myths and origin stories as to where the shower beer came from. I think many people tend to discover it by themselves

&gt;##6. What's your favorite shower beer story?

&gt;&gt;**toat** Not quite a story but it's always nice when you are able to expose someone new to the sport. I have turned numerous lady friends onto the shower beer while having some group shower fun and that is always the most rewarding experience.

&gt;&gt; End Note: Don't be afraid to try the shower beer and experiment, just frontiers yet to be explored. Just be careful about getting water in your beer, that shit sucks.

**12

I wish I had been able to cover this subreddit when the war first broke across Reddit

Well

**TL;DR:** /u/Lycerius plays the PC game Civilizations II intermittently for over 10 years since the game was released. This is farther than anyone has ever gone before. He didn’t play to win and this led to a stalemate between the now three super powers of the world: Celtania

(TL;DR: Man + Civ. II + 10 years = Awesome)

The whole concept just seemed to jump and grab my attention. I love the idea of playing video games unlike how they were intended and just freestyling and having fun with it. I mean when I played Skyrim I never beat that game, the Eternal War is really an excellent and creative idea that I’m so thankful Lycerius was kind enough to share with the Reddit community.

On top of being a standalone achievement in unique gameplay, [mini series](http://www.reddit.com/r/Theenternalminiseries/), new challenges, and personal achievements are all shared on the subreddit to bring even more life to the game. 

Finally

I was able to interview two mods of the subreddit. Unfortunately

&gt;##1. What would you like to say to those that have never heard of “The Eternal War” before?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** I'd say that it's one of the best examples of something springing from the collective mind of the reddit community. It's really amazing how many people subscribed to the subreddit in the first few hours after it was created.

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I think it is something that they should check out and get some background on. I remember being on one day at work when it was slow, or who haven't checked in on it in awhile, I think they should. It's a fascinating case study in game mechanics and how people have a way of playing games in ways the designers never intended.

&gt;##2. What stance do you take in the war: America

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** Being Irish

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I like the Vikings

&gt;##3. Have you ever finished the war making it unternal?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** Shockingly

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I have not, and many have posted their solutions. The great thing is that many are unique, which is what I personally love about the Civilization games.

&gt;##4. I was really intrigued by the whole concept

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** Honestly

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I think that the idea of continuing to play a game for a decade, caring enough about your investment in the game to go back to it. Then there is the aspect of getting into a stalemate with AI controlled enemies that have exploited their abilities to the best desired outcome. All of this goes to show that this is a game that gives players a challenge, and is still viable a decade later.

&gt;##5. Greatest moment of gameplay you have experienced?

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** My favorite moment would probably be when someone discovered The Sioux. Just a tiny little outpost far from the fighting

&gt;##6. Do you still continue to start up the game and play after all this time?

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I have

&gt;##7. Have you kept up with the Civalization game series? Which is your favorite?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** I have Civ 4 and Civ 5. Civ 5 became my favourite of the two after the gods and kings DLC.

&gt;##8. Is there anything else you would like to add

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** It would be nice to see more stories of people actually having finished the war and how they went about it (my favourite was a guy who won it with the Sioux Nation!)

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I too wish more people would play in this world. For awhile, political, and social perspectives.

Now to introduce myself: Hello, but I've only had this account for about 3 months. I can't quite think of much else to say as far as Reddit goes.

Hi there folks, dry bread called *grissini,* [otherwise known to North American palettes as Breadsticks.](http://i.imgur.com/k3DDkxI.gif)

While you are [selecting your entree](http://i.imgur.com/Xbr74U4.gif) from our unmatched collection of traditional italian dishes, and they don't fuck around.

Now that we have placed your order I would like to ensure that your every need is met. Do you have enough water? May I top off your wineglass? Can I interest you in some more breadsticks? [They are unlimited

Does the restaurant's ambiance met your expectations? We are renovating over 350 of our locations to more accurately reflect the tradition Tuscan dining experience. Please excuse the mess. Can I offer you some more [breadsticks?](http://i.imgur.com/S9WXNgT.png) Don't forget to save room for dessert!

Now please

&gt;When you visit your favourite restaurant for dinner

&gt;&gt;**CircleJerkAmbassador:** Nothin' zapps me up like a golden weaved basket o breadsticks! Just make sure they are from a restaurant that has hospitaliano!

&gt;&gt;**reese_ridley:** Whenever I go out to eat, why not have both? And if I'm going to have my cake (and by ""cake,"" I mean Olive Garden's soup and salad bar) and eat it too, why not have unlimited amounts of each?

&gt;&gt;**eyjafjallajoekull:** What a silly question! Nothing gets me in the mood quite like breadsticks! As the famous poet Brad Stick (formerly Handsum Hart) once said

&gt;&gt;**Suspended_Animation:** I'm a breadstick and soup kind of guy! Give me a basket of unlimited breadsticks, and I'll be in heaven.

&gt;Are there any other items which catch your attention on the menu?

&gt;&gt;**Suspended_Animation:** I'm a big fan of Dipping Sauces for Breadsticks. Most people never ask, the answer to the question is you take perfection, and dunk it in delicious marinara, alfredo, or five cheese marinara sauce! I'm also a big fan of Stuffed Mushrooms and Ravioli di Portobello. Mmmm.

&gt;&gt;**CircleJerkAmbassador:** Sometimes I just want some soup and salad with it. I've got a big appetite and a man can't live on breadsticks alone! I need unlimited soup and salad as well. I think there's even a place that sells it for $8.99.

&gt;&gt;**eyjafjallajoekull:** Besides unlimited soups and salads? Smoked Mozzarella Fonduta and Fettuccine Alfredo really get me going. Unfortunately, atheist scientist in his early 20's the oppression I had to face on a daily basis became simply unbearable) and am hence rather restricted in my culinary choices. Every second week, however, I board a plane to Italy in order to visit Olive Garden's trainee camp there and subsequently indulge in eating orgies the likes of which have never been seen on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

&gt;&gt;**LinkFixerBot:** During all the years visiting my favorite, enabling me to place my order without wasting time reading. That's why I have more time to admire the beautiful interior, the friendly staff, and the colorful and elegant decoration. It's like you're actually IN Italy yourself.

&gt;&gt;**A_Cylon_Raider:** Well they have frozen Coke for a limited time only. A small for less than a dollar!

&gt;&gt;**reese_ridley:** I have an ongoing love affair with seafood

&gt;Which two nouns would use if you were to name a restaurant?

&gt;&gt;**reese_ridley:** Well

&gt;&gt;**Suspended_Animation:** As an Italian immigrant whose first language isn't English, or thing. When I think about my childhood, growing up on the Italy countryside, I think of all the lush and beautiful gardens. I remember running through the gardens, chasing my brothers and sisters, and then dining on the finest cheese and olives at lunch time. Italy is especially known for their olives. I have a lot of childhood memories in Italy, so if I had to name my restaurant

&gt;&gt;**A_Cylon_Raider:** Burger and King.

&gt;&gt;**CircleJerkAmbassador:** Well

&gt;&gt;**MrTyphoon:** If I were to name an authentic italian restaurant

&gt;Say you were asked to speak out on behalf of a restaurant. Would you be willing to do that?

&gt;&gt;**eyjafjallajoekull:** You might not have noticed but I'm a huge aficionado of Olive Garden, because it's true: When you're here, you're family! Olive Garden is what the American dream is all about. While Olive Garden has certainly gotten quite a bit of unfair criticism (see for example [this insane rant](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/5625/6639)), we will never back down from our staunch stance against any kinds of restrictions against free speech, whether they be SOPA, ACTA or Puma. We're not here to pander to any phony lobbyist's sensibilities and we're thankful that [attractive](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dcr3j/i_am_a_comedian_named_bo_burnham_ama/c9p3v10?context=3) Redditors [everywhere](http://i.imgur.com/F0Aas4R.png ) have taken notice, not just of our political righteousness but also of our delicious and unlimited breadsticks, [here](http://i.imgur.com/KxAXc6J.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/DPIL4Hu.png) (or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cz9iq/i_was_asked_to_circlejerk_about_olive_garden_in_a/c9lgxrh), seeing as Olive Garden's staff is highly enlightened and logical.

&gt;&gt;**reese_ridley:** Hell yes I would. I honestly don't know why more companies don't do this. I'm a poor college student

&gt;&gt;**ArchangelleGabrielle:** no absolutely not i cannot stand shilling especially on a site as pure as reddit (please visit /r/hailcorporate[1] to learn more)
 
&gt;&gt;**CircleJerkAmbassador:** Well if they were an amazing authentic restaurant I totally would. Pretty much, would you? If not you're a cold hearted bastard.

&gt;Why breadsticks?

&gt;&gt;**LiterallyKesha:**BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKED.
 
&gt;&gt;I'm fucking welling up
 
&gt;&gt;/*sigh*/ so much beauty in our little online community on this isolated social media website.
 
&gt;&gt;H-Hold me fellow diners.
 
&gt;&gt;For all the dippers, posting, lurking, sipping, consuming, frequent dining, enjoying that last final bite, the pasta seasoners, the employees and even the Italians at heart who just want a little taste of home.
 
&gt;&gt;Often we forget why we're here, always changing, always adapting. Many of us have been through the worst of shit, left in the dirt feeling worthless and we never wanted to feel that away again, so we lifted a breadstick, sipped some soup - whatever we could to feel strong and worthwhile, to feel like family, then rebuilt ourselves again and we mould ourselves still...from that same ball of clay until we got what we wanted.
 
&gt;&gt;Millions won't know of our dedication, its no big thing, you eat, sleep and live this because its what you understand most, its fundamental to who you are now, and all of us started somewhere and are constantly giving a leg up to others on a daily basis and we spread our love through [gift cards.](http://www.olivegarden.ca/Gift-Cards/)
 
&gt;&gt;Forgive my sappiness
 
&gt;&gt;Thank you Olive Garden.
 
&gt;&gt;But thank you everyone else here also.
 
&gt;&gt;There will be breadsticks in heaven. I promise you this.

&gt;&gt;**ArchangelleGabrielle:** Adrian Chen
 
&gt;&gt;Chen says to the smoking hot blonde waitress, and fuck reddit, it's full of pedos.""
 
&gt;&gt;Watson says to the waitress, and a blogger. I'm trying to make the world a better place. So I'll have the unlimited soup and salad bar, because fuck the patriarchy.""
 
&gt;&gt;MRC says to the waitress, and there weren’t other factors (biology or chance) influencing decisions. This is not even close to true.
 
&gt;&gt;But suppose you modify your claim and just say “most” variance from 50-50 is oppression. That’s better, the gender distribution of violent prisoners is overwhelmingly male. Is this because the patriarchy constructs gender roles that hurt men and cause them to act out in aggressive ways? Possibly. But then why do some men act more aggressively than others? Are they just more patriarchy-affected? There is already an explanation for this, and it holds a lot of water: testosterone plus stupidity. Very high or very low levels of testosterone are associated with risk tolerance, and stupidity is associated with violent crime; more men are at the lower end of the intellectual curve due to greater variance, and more men will be more likely to have high testosterone. [[...]](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/1cjxlr/adrian_chen_rebecca_watson_and/)

&gt;&gt;**reese_ridley:** First of all, the price of each individual breadstick can be thought of as $6.95/infinity, which mathematically translates to zero. So not only are you getting unlimited breadsticks, but with a little dose of logic n' science^tm you're actually getting free unlimited breadsticks! Sagan himself couldn't design a more perfect reward for us mortals.

&gt;&gt;**CircleJerkAmbassador:** Why? Why not? Breadsticks are great alone, most versatile meal you can have! Sweet salty butter, combined with a hint of garlic and baked to perfection. A browned crust (not too light or dark), yet somehow tender and soft enough as if you were eating the cloud God himself was standing on.
Warm like a mother's womb

&gt;&gt;A breadstick is just a breadstick. It does not matter the color of its skin

&gt;&gt;**eyjafjallajoekull:** I am the dressing of my salad
 
&gt;&gt;Flour is my Body and Sauce is my Blood
 
&gt;&gt;I have created over a Thousand Breadsticks
 
&gt;&gt;Unknown to Bertucci's
 
&gt;&gt;Nor known to Carrabbas
 
&gt;&gt;Have withstood satiety to feed many families
 
&gt;&gt;Yet those Hands will never hold Salad. So
 
&gt;&gt;Unlimited Bread Sticks.
 
&gt;&gt;**A_Cylon_Raider:** What?

&gt;&gt;**MANBOT_:** What the fuck did you just fucking order, and I have served over 300 confirmed breadsticks. I am trained in serving soup and salad and I’m the top waiter in the entire state branch of the franchise. You are everything to me but just another customer. I will treat you the fuck politely with courtesy the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with paying for unlimited soup and salad? Think again, sir. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of traditional Italian chefs across the room and your table is being traced right now so you better prepare for the first course, friend. The course that wipes out the pathetic little thing we call hunger. You’re fucking served, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in waiting tables, you didn’t,

First off, I'm usually sick of them, but hey, left over food means I don't have to cook / buy food. So there is *that* benefit.

As for you deal seekers, cause either you'll be sleeping after staying up all night and then shopping like its the end of the world only to be victorious and bringing home the spoils of Black Friday. I've done it twice myself. It had its good times and bad times. But mostly, I hated that feeling where you've been standing for 9~12 hours and time itself is warpping around you. The floor seems to be moving in a zig zag way and you and your fellow shoppers have degraded into a Lord of the Flies scenerio when it comes to a hot item.

We have all dealt with this problem before. You are in your car driving to work. You are riding the bus on the way to school. You are in your home doing the dishes. You are exercising at the gym.

[And your music sounds awful because your speakers are crappy.](http://i.imgur.com/KgykY.gif) 

But is it just your speakers? What about the device producing the sound? What about the cables carrying the signal to the speakers? What about the walls around you

[You think that's air you're breathing right now?](http://i.imgur.com/kVsYL.gif)

Audiophiles seek to control all of these elements and more. The goal: completely lifelike sound quality

The dream might be in vain; [some stereo reviewers feel that perfect reproduction is impossible](http://www.stereophile.com/content/audio-research-reference-150-power-amplifier) and that you can try ad nauseum to approach the original but [you will never exactly duplicate it.](http://i.imgur.com/LNxNO.gif) 

/r/audiophile is a subreddit for those who wish to take up that challenge. 

I decided to talk to the mods for a deeper

&gt; What is your audiophile background? What is your setup like?

&gt;&gt;**keanex:** I first got into audio a few years ago, believe it or not they actually do sound pretty great. It was because of them that I decided to learn more about headphones which lead me onto my journey.

&gt;&gt; From there I researched a lot of Head-Fi and a few other various sites where I decided to upgrade my home listening by purchasing a pair of Grado SR80i. I had a love/hate relationship with them and eventually sold them to buy my beloved Audio Technica Ad700 which lead me to the Audio Technica Ad2000 that I own today as my ""flagship"" headphones

&gt;&gt; As I learned more about headphones through researching on Head-Fi and reading as much as I could, gave me a chance. It sort of snowballed from there and now I am in contact with various companies to review their IEMs. That in combination with my headphone guide, that I linked above, are my contributions I've made to the audio world. Heck I think anyone who has purchased the Brainwavz HM5 has read my review! I'm very proud of that.

&gt;&gt; As of now I'm currently using the JDS Labs O2 amplifier with their ODAC at home, which is a huge pain I must say. I use that set-up with the various IEMs I own or my Audio Technica Ad2000. For portable use I just use an iPod Classic and whatever IEMs I'm in the process of reviewing, I like to have all of my music with me because I never know what I'll want to listen to.

&gt;&gt;**calinet6:** I have always loved music and been entranced by good sound, very simple but sweet and incredibly realistic sound) and a beautiful old Sony amplifier, and a turntable of course. I grew up on CDs though, and I remember listening to old folk music on repeat on that system, and just how it enveloped the whole room when it was on, as if we were hearing the music live. The difference between ""the big speakers"" and the computer speakers in the other room was pretty obvious to me.

&gt;&gt; When I moved out and went to college, similar 2-way bookshelf speakers. I blew them out in the first year, and repaired them with various parts, and that was my introduction to a little DIY and the importance of quality equipment. Later in college I discovered thrift shops, and had a couple great vintage finds including a 1978 Bose 501 Series II (Bose was actually pretty good back in the day) and various others. This was when the bug really began to bite.

&gt;&gt; When I moved again, they have a certain sparkle and honesty that is difficult to reproduce, and in any case they hold their own against modern bookshelf speakers at a great value. I power them with a 1960's-era Dynaco Stereo 70 tube amplifier that I rebuilt myself with a modern circuit design. The combination is sublime, and didn't cost too much. I feel little need to go any further in the equipment hunt since I enjoy it so much. Every once in a while I get in a tweaking mood and adjust the speaker position and the tubes, but mostly these days, I try to just enjoy what I have and listen to the music instead of the equipment.

&gt;What is your favorite submission to /r/audiophile so far?

&gt;&gt;**keanex:** I can't say one submission has stuck out more than the next, our moderator Uncle_Erik being one of them and other posters like IronRedSix add heaps of useful information if you ever have a question.

&gt;&gt;**calinet6:** There have been many great submissions, and in any case, it's a lot of fun to see how others reproduce sound. There are endless combinations, and I think that's what's so fun about it—a million ways to achieve the same goal. If you like audio gear too, or have some to show off, I definitely recommend /r/avporn (which I started, so... shameless plug).

&gt;&gt; My other favorite posts are the ones that start

&gt; I see a lot of Beats by Dre hate on this subreddit. Do you encourage that?

&gt;&gt;**keanex:** Since we focus on high-end equipment most Beats posts are usually removed. If I'm removing them I tend to leave a link to /r/headphones

&gt;&gt; To answer the question more directly, it's just something people are tired of seeing. I guess an equivalent would be people posting about Coors Light in /r/beer asking whether it's good, or asking if Starbucks is good in a coffee subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**calinet6:** I started out with Bose headphones and had Bose speakers in college—so I understand where people are coming from when they have this initial view that Bose or Beats (and their kin: Soul, WeSC, and anything they sell at Urban Outfitters) are great. Yeah, they sound good if you haven't experienced other brands, I completely understand. So our view here is to try to be educational and understanding and get people to branch out, and maybe save money in the process. I think what people don't realize is that they're paying (a lot) for an image, not necessarily for audio quality, and direct them to various guides and /r/headphones for more. But in the end

&gt; Do you own any Monster Cable? Do you love James Randi?

&gt;&gt;**keanex:** I do not own any Monster products

&gt;&gt;**calinet6:** I own no Monster products currently—I got some of their fat cables once with a pair of used speakers, they have cheap spools of good-quality thick cables, and you don't need anything more than that.

&gt;&gt; I love that you brought up James Randi (for those who don't know, people pay too much for cables. Yes, it's very unlikely to make a difference. But I see this argument leaking into the silliest places—like people claiming equipment is the same based on measurements alone, and ignoring listening tests; or companies using listening tests only to design their products, and ignoring measurements.

&gt;&gt; You have to strike a balance. The human ear is a flawed piece of equipment: it is designed to fill in holes and fool our brains into thinking something is there when it's not. It's designed to handle noisy environments and imperfect acoustics. It is not designed to pick out minute differences, and that is—not much on either. I'm not saying that $12,000 cables cause a difference—if anything, my argument is proof that you don't need them, because you won't be able to hear a difference anyway—but I am saying that if anything, you certainly won't be able to prove a difference with a device as flawed as the human ear, even if you can hear or feel differences you can't describe or remember. I think there are subtle subconscious effects that can't be identified by someone trying to remember how something sounded in a 30 second clip repeated 50 times. Sometimes it manifests as a feeling, but either way—it doesn't matter. By focusing on differences you can actually hear, and %THD values)

&gt;&gt; I try to keep this kind of balanced argument going in the subreddit—extremism is the root of all evil

&gt; What are the main requirements to be an ""audiophile"" in your opinion?

&gt;&gt;**keanex:** I really don't like the term audiophile as it carries a snobby stigma about it

&gt;&gt;**calinet6:** I don't believe there are requirements—though this has been a point of contention in the subreddit. An audiophile is someone who enjoys quality reproduction of sound, ""(fraternal) love""—or roughly, ""to love to listen."" It doesn't matter if you own expensive equipment or you got your speakers from a garage sale, if you love to listen to sound, then you can be an audiophile too. This isn't an exclusive club. People can get quite condescending about it; I hear people putting down others for their low-priced or 'currently trendy' equipment (cough AT M50 headphones) and it's just not necessary. What are they trying to achieve? Feeling better about themselves for owning better equipment or knowing more things? We don't tolerate that kind of negative exclusivity, and I think it makes for a better community.

&gt; What are your hopes for the future of the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**keanex:** My only hope for the future of /r/audiophile is that we keep helping people who are new to the hobby. My advice though is to please use the search function before asking your question!

&gt;&gt;**calinet6:** I think the future is looking bright! We recently passed 10k subscribers and growing, so that newcomers will have one central place to learn the ropes, in a similar unpretentious and practical style that the subreddit enjoys.

&gt;&gt; Most of all I hope people keep on enjoying music in all its glory

&gt;&gt; Finally, read the sidebar first and use the search! There are tons of great answers already and I'm sure those resources will help you find what you need to improve your listening experience. Thanks!

This post is late

Despite my lack of preparedness and the few words I have for just how great a game Borderlands is - I was able to get one of the mods
_____

&gt;Why Borderlands? What makes it the game to play?

&gt;&gt; That question is ""more busted than my momma's girl parts!"". Borderlands is made up of so many elements that gamers thrive for. It's set in an open world named ""Pandora"" inhabited by skags, psychos, spiderants, and...did I mention midgets? Well, you catch my Drifter. In addition to a large open world, your goal is to find and open the Vault which can be opened once every 200 years. Your character has several NPC's along the way to give you missions and items to help you reach your goal. You can choose between four different character classes in the beginning of the game depending on your particular gaming style. In Borderlands 1, each of these classes have 3 different skill trees you can build to maximize your performance with certain items and weapons. Co-op gameplay in Borderlands is some of the most enjoyable gaming you'll experience. Players take on quests and enemies together as a team (4 players per session). Players can exchange weapons, or melee each other to induce a PvP arena. Borderlands 1 is known for its well done DLC (downloadable content). Its 4 DLCs add hours upon hours to the game. The next feature is for all you loot-fetishists out there. Borderlands has a loot system that randomly generates several different weapons and items every time you score one. So make sure you search every inch of Pandora (yes

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;Borderlands 2 releases on September 18, and [trailers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nicvyhrmTDs), it looks like it just might be the best shooter of the year. If you haven't played Borderlands 1, I highly suggest buying it and running through a campaign or two to pass the time. You'll fall in love with all the characters and get caught up on the story. You can find the ""Game of the Year"" edition pretty cheap these days. When it's on sale at Steam or Amazon, the PC-GOTY version can run around $7.50. Our subreddit is a good place to watch during these sales. We usually have GOTY giveaways so keep an eye out for those! If you just don't have the time for the first game, pick up the sequel anyway. I have a hunch you won't need to know much about the first installment to enjoy the second. This game has fantastic story telling.

&gt;How does /r/Borderlands enhance my Claptrap experience?

&gt;&gt;Haha. I've typed all this without even mentioning our beloved CL4TP-TP...or you may call him by his locally designated name
r/borderlands is a fantastic resource for Vault hunters to congregate and discuss everything about Pandora. It's a place where we share our loadouts, and more importantly...find co-op partners. If you need some buddies to join you on your quest for the vault, come to r/borderlands and make a post requesting help. Remember: after you post, assign your link flair specifying your platform of choice! We also have several Gearbox employees that frequent our subreddit.
Now. Back to modding weapons. r/borderlands accepts ALL players. We have had users arguing back and forth over the idea of modding your own weapons. Listen: You play the game how YOU want to play the game. You are the only one responsible for your experience. If you love to mod your weapons, make a post on r/borderlands and after you specify your platform, hit the ""mods"" button next to it. We have replaced the NSFW feature with this. This will let other players know that ""hey man, I roll with modded inventory"". If you don't like modded weapons in your multiplayer experience or don't care, don't push the button. If you REALLY hate modded weapons, say so inside the post. We're ALL just trying to get to the Vault, man.

&gt;What advice would you have for someone new to the game?

&gt;&gt;In my experience
Regarding DLC. Play the first 2 playthroughs of the game before starting any DLCs. Afterwards

&gt;Let's talk about the developer

&gt;&gt;Amidst of all the developer and publisher controversy you'll find on the web, Randy Pitchford is a sexy beast!

**As a celebration of today's award

Alright, maybe /r/StuffISeeEveryDayAsAMallSecurityGuard, but this subreddit we have today is the real deal!

I chose this subreddit for 2 good reasons.  First of all, so I thought it would be clever to have some pretend animosity towards these fine redditors.  If we said, ""we're gunning for you bastards, we don't like you"", maybe we'd all have some fun trying to raise our subscriber numbers closer to theirs.  This plan all went to hell once I got in touch with the mods... oh my.  The moderators of this place are easily some of the nicest, kindest, most complimentary people in the world!  Why is it everytime I search for a nemesis, how the world mocks me!

What I can say is this.  Today we celebrate /r/girlsinyogapants with the following wish...  user content!  We, [Thickfreakness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X_lOZI9KWI)!

I'll conclude by saying this, we thank you for your dedication to the awesome.  Now on with the interview with /u/Moottoboot, /r/DragonHunter, and /r/candybaws

&gt;I'm going to say it right at the top... /r/girlsinyogapants is by far the most important subreddit of them all.  If you agree with me

&gt;&gt;Moottoboot:  We are of course the most important subreddit of them all

&gt;&gt;DragonHunter:  The Almighty mootoboot hired me on as a mod because GIYP is, beautiful asses. We need not fear the people around us who might notice we're staring...

&gt;&gt;Candybaws:  I firmly believe that /r/girlsinyogapants is the centre of the known universe. Why? Because it's always about the ass. Especially when it's tightly clad in a pair of yoga pants.

&gt;What fraction of posts are considered ""amateur models"" and what fraction are ""professional models""? Have you noticed any trends?

&gt;&gt;MB:  Not really to be honest. Models and actresses get some familiarity votes but I feel that the real girls get genuine appreciation votes. Age doesn't really matter much at all either as #4 all time is what appears to be a middle aged soccer mom bum in slightly see through yellow pants.

&gt;&gt;DH:  I have no idea. I'm a bumfan

&gt;&gt;CB:  Professional shots in porn rarely do anything for me. They're lit badly, and even those who deny any knowledge of camera technique always compose a photo better than a 'pro photographer' in the porn field.

&gt;Subject matter or composition - what do you think makes a great post?

&gt;&gt;MB:  For the most part composition, professional shots or the ever controvercial creep shots are all given time here and a quick look at the top 100 all-time will show you that even low end cameraphone shots can bring the votes.

&gt;&gt;DH:  A great post is a nicely-lit

&gt;&gt;CB:  Everyday environments. Lighting that's not offensive (see above). An ass is required (it would seem some people really don't have one). Actual yoga pants too. We're easy on other things - 'yoga shorts' are on the good end of the acceptance list

&gt;What are you most proud of as a moderator of this amazing subreddit?

&gt;&gt;For me I am very proud of this little creepy place. It can be somewhat time intensive but I have the best seat in the house as a mod here. This all started with a comment about how there should be a place for girls in yoga pants so

&gt;&gt;When we got big the spammers and bloggers took notice. As a moderator I don't like to dictate content but there came a point where my wanting to let voters decide content had to be dealt with and after an [uprising amongst the voters](http://redd.it/r5cem) and my [subsequent rebuttal](http://redd.it/r9sr2) changes were needed. I scraped some image host identification icons and .css from /r/wallpapers to help identify where the links were hosted

&gt;&gt;As we stand now

&gt;&gt;DH:  Being a mod here. There's eighty billion reddit users and four mods. That's a pretty small crowd.

&gt;&gt;CB:  As DragonHunter said, but we can't catch everything all the time. I'm definitely happiest when I check the subscribers and see there's a few more people discovering /r/girlsinyogapants and adding it to their list.

&gt;The last paragraph is yours...

&gt;&gt;MB:  Well

&gt;&gt;DH:  Thanks to all the posters of fine material for GIYP. Make sure you think of /r/ass

&gt;&gt;CB:  Thanks to moottoboot for creating this wonderful haven of stretchy coverings of wonderful behinds. Thanks to my fellow mods for being on the ball. And thanks to the users for getting us to where we are. But it doesn't stop here! Get your friends (possibly not family,,False,self,t5_2sgno,1343702063.0,,True

On to today's feature... welcome to /r/Metal

This is the magnetic North of metal on reddit.  The metal mecca, tons of great comments and a helpful community who are passionate about their music interest.  Now look, I understand that metal may not be directly on your radar, and that's fine.  But for those who are into this music, [/r/metal](/r/metal) is crucial!  I won't over sell this place, here's two incredibly nice moderators, Skuld and BrutalN00dle to participate in today's interview!

&gt;Please explain /r/Metal - is it just videos?

&gt;&gt;**Skuld**:  Videos are the most popular content on the subreddit. There's not that much decent heavy metal journalism out there unfortunatly.

&gt;&gt;**BrutalN00dle**:  /r/metal is the home of heavy metal on reddit. Any kind of submission is encouraged as long as it is related to heavy metal in some way (We do not allow image-meme posts

&gt;I see the community is very active

&gt;&gt;**BN**:  We're all passionate about heavy metal, bullshitting about heavy metal with the others that are there for the same purpose. Half the fun of the music is discussing it, and when everybody is as opinionated as the average metalhead (or as opinionated as I am), it leads to quite a bit of back and forth discussion.

&gt;&gt;**Skuld**:  Metal fans have strong opinions

&gt;Music has it's purposes: Dance, etc. Can you address the theory or purpose of metal?

&gt;&gt;**Skuld**:This is a hard question! My answer is because it sounds good

&gt;&gt;Metal fans are often passionate about the genre. People rarely listen to the music as a fashion statement, greatest hits compilation CDs are rare.

&gt;&gt;You could stumble across a great band with 100 fans

&gt;&gt;**BN**:This question has been asked many times on /r/Metal, and a million other perfectly valid and honest reasons. For me? Nothing else ever compared. I didn't listen to music really until my early teens, when I started listening to angerpop, and kept searching until I found the sound I wanted; cliche or not, I remember the very first time I heard Slayer. After that I never could I figure out why I spent so much time listening to Linkin Park, Slipknot and the like.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;**BN**:  Self-Post Friday began as an experiment. Many veteran (and many not-so-veteran) users pointed out the disproportionate amount of youtube-links on the Shreddit frontpage, and Self-Post Day was a reaction to that. It went over well and we turned it into a weekly event. Now that we do this, we've had some great threads on the nature of women in metal, homophobia, elitism, and so on; and it is very possible that these awesome posts would have been buried under reposts.

&gt;&gt;**Skuld**:  Music posts have traditionally been the overwhelming majority of content in the subreddit

&gt;&gt;I thought of a few different ways to get around this

&gt;&gt;Flipping the self-post switch on the subreddit for 24hrs has been one of my better ideas on reddit. The way reddit works, we're left with at least half a page of good discussions, and always a discussion as post #1 - meaning it will hit the front page of all the subscribers. This would not be possible if links were in the mix too, they simply get upvoted more than self-posts.
BrutalN00dle is the one to thank for actually remembering to change the setting at the end of the week

&gt;Please tell us three reasons why you enjoy moderating /r/Metal and one thing you'd like to change.

&gt;&gt;**BN**:  This is a cop-out, and so most of the mod-team's time is still spent participating in Shreddit like normal. So I only really have one reason, and that's because I like helping out the community I'm a part of. and one thing you'd like to change.

&gt;&gt;Personally, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, etc; and everybody remotely into metal has heard Opeth and Mastodon, I think everybody enjoys Shreddit more when there's new bands to listen to and there's something to talk about.

&gt;&gt;**Skuld**:  I already made my change
I set up some post tags for subgenres a while back

&gt;Thanks for your time - anything you'd like to add? Anything I forgot to ask?

&gt;&gt;**BN**:  We have an IRC channel

&gt;&gt;**Skuld**:   Hail Satan. Wimps and posers leave the hall.

It was the morning of a monday and i had a big test that day. I wake up and see that my alarm has been turned off by my stupid brain during my sleep and i had 15 mins left to reach the test in time. And it takes 1/2 and hour to reach my college &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ... 

You can probably imagine what happened.

I FREAK THE FUCK OUT.  
I Jump and start doing all the things together. brushing

Its times like these that reminds me the value of peace. One cannot know the true meaning of peace unless he faces hardships.  
So does it means that the man who finds the ultimate peace is the one who has faced the greatest hardship ? Its possible.

In today's corporate world many people run or should i say almost all people run behind money *thinking* that it will bring peace and happiness. A wise man said that a man traveled all over the world searching for peace but finally found it in his home.

This peace i am taking about is not found easily. And one of the surest ways to find it is using meditation. Now you may think ""Hey you ! Dont go all philosophical shit on me!"" Yea i know. But truth is bitter. Meditation is known to calm your inner self. In today's stressful world meditation can help you calm your nerves. Meditation can also help you in building concentration and if done properly

You may think meditation is *not cool* or *is bullshit* but trust me .. Its not. Its scientifically proven that meditation can help you become a better person altogether. So basically /r/Meditation is a forum to help people practice this amazing activity.

They say meditation is like magic. When one does it properly he travels to his subconscious and enters a whole different amazing world which others cant even dream of and his life will change and he will be able to become more awesomer! :D

So i sat down with the moderator and here's a small interview! :)

&gt;##1. What inspires/motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**sfacets:** Having grown up in a 'New-Age' family
Meditation for me should be independent from any dogma. It can be spiritually-focused or not
I started this subreddit to create a space where people could freely share their experiences with their respective forms of meditation and also learn from others.  
I noticed that there were quite a few people interested in beginning to meditate - and more established meditators have always been happy to help out

&gt;##2. do you practice meditation ? if yes
&gt;&gt;**sfacets:** These days I meditate using a range of methods, especially being at Uni. I will usually meditate in the morning, before my mind becomes active, I find that this way 15 minutes is enough to give me focus for the day. 

&gt;##3. do you believe meditation helps ? please explain how.
&gt;&gt;**sfacets:** Being 'mindful' or 'aware' is all about living in the present - acting instead of reacting. Once a person enters this space, and will always have a positive outlook on life - which will communicate itself to others. This is something that is cultured over a period of time spent meditating - there is little benefit to meditating once for an hour, rather the effects are noticed over a period of time spent meditating - so meditating for short periods over time adds up. Of course there are many reasons for why people choose to meditate - some see meditation as the goal itself, some as a way to achieve one.

&gt;##4. what do you think is the best part of meditation ?
&gt;&gt;**sfacets:** For me the best part of meditation is the point at which my thoughts are calmed

&gt;##5. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**sfacets:** Don't be daunted by all the sitting and the lingo… meditation at heart is a very simple concept

Thank you and a happy tuesday!

When I was younger and in college I went through an artsy fartsy phase. Beanie and everything. Yeah... I was a hipster before it was cool. I still am, it was a time of new beginnings. A time to jump into new fun hobbies and pastimes to enjoy. One of which is my love for typography, calligraphy, graffiti &amp; penmanship in general. If you've been a long time reader of /r/SROTD you'd already know that. Since I've features subreddits related to these topics multiple times. So its with great pleasure I feature another one that I'm really proud of, /r/PenmanshipPorn.

Yes, pen, paper = magic. Its as simple as it gets.

I've been a lurker their for a while. I dare not post anything myself, one day I'll post something there, and hopefully (not delete it in a few minutes) be proud of it.

Interview with the mod(s) ~~on the way.~~ is up!


&gt;# How did you get in to Penmanship?

&gt;&gt;**BBS-** Well, so naturally when I write something it has to be perfect. When writing, I can't stand having one word that's larger than another or having another mistake like that. So basically, I didn't chose the life of penmanship, it chose me.

&gt;# What is your favorite post so far?

&gt;&gt;**BBS-**  I know I'm a little biased since it's my own post, which is one of my favorite styles of handwriting.

&gt;#What are some things to know when starting this fine hobby?

&gt;&gt;**BBS-** When trying to improve your penmanship one thing I would recommend doing is just focus on your handwriting. What I mean by that is you should be more of a perfectionist like me
 
&gt;#Whats a big ""No no"" in penmanship?

&gt;&gt;**BBS-**  For me

&gt;#Fountain pen are the best kind of pen or the bestest?

1049 movie goers

----

Ever feel like going out to the movies, where people can see you.  Dealing with icky dirty theater floors.  Dealing with previews.  Running past the cops because you're violating your probation.  It's a major pain.

Luckily, you probably enjoyed watching *Catwoman*.  Does that make sense?  Probably not.  I just wanted to mention one of the worst movies ever, and how not eating popcorn while movie watching equals that kind of bad taste.  Do you really want it spread around that you like *that* movie?  Have you no shame?

I guess a better question for discussion wouldn't be if you eat popcorn while moving watching

&gt;##What is /r/movieaweek and how does it work?
&gt;&gt; **/u/whowhatwhere11109**: /r/movieaweek is a community where we watch and discuss movies that are available on Netflix Instant. Each week we vote for a new movie to watch. Voting opens on Monday and the movie with the highest number of upvotes is announced on Friday. The discussion opens on Friday evening and continues throughout the week.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Flychageo**:  /r/movieaweek is best described as a ""movie-book club"" specifically geared toward movies available on Instant Netflix. Every week a movie is nominated

&gt;##How did the sub get started
&gt;&gt; **/u/whowhatwhere11109** Cttouch created this sub a year ago with the idea of starting a movie club, there were discussions in /r/netflixbestof about starting a movie club. Cttouch took the initiative to direct interested parties to this sub and got the ball rolling with our Week 1 movie! Flychageo and I were added as moderators to try and take some of the burden off of cttouch.

&gt;##What makes for a good nomination?
&gt;&gt; **/u/whowhatwhere11109** The best nominations are for controversial movies that will generate a lot of discussion. We try to avoid movies that are universally loved or hated. The voting is run in contest mode so scores are hidden

&gt;&gt; **/u/Flychageo**: Well rule-wise the best nominations have links to the Netflix and IMDB page
Personally I think what makes a good nomination is a submission with all of the factors above that also has many down votes because that means that it will lead to some controversial and varied discussion

&gt; ##What do you hope to see for the future for your subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **/u/whowhatwhere11109** I would like to see a more in depth discussion of movies beyond what people liked or disliked about the movie. I think it would be cool in the future if we could really dissect some of these films and discuss them on a deeper level.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Flychageo**: I hope to see alot of things in the future for this subreddit! Namely I would just love to see more people joining in and creating some more interesting discussion other than just saying ""I liked it"". The mod team has been discussing about whether or not we should make discussion questions so that more varied discussion will happen. Other than that I'd one day love to learn how to manipulate the CSS a little bit to make the subreddit a little more flashy and memorable.

&gt; ##Do you have any special discussions for the selected movies?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Flychageo**: As of right now we only have 1 discussion per movie, but right now I think just 1 discussion is working well.

&gt; ##You have a schedule of movie genres to feature - how rigid are you in sticking to those? Any specific definitions you use for them?

&gt;&gt; **/u/whowhatwhere11109** We currently have a [schedule of the movie genres](http://i.imgur.com/vMQsQVZ.png) that will be featured each week. This was suggested by subscribers in order to allow us to watch a variety of movies from different genres. The current schedule takes us through the end of June

&gt;&gt; **/u/Flychageo**:  Well I personally am not extremely rigid. If a post is clearly not of the genre then I will enforce it, then I let it slide. If I'm really not sure then I'll message the person who submitted it and let them explain why it is that genre. As a basis though Netlfix and IMDB usually say what genre it is so we can reference that, however this can be tricky for genres such as ""classic"".


&gt; Will there be any simultaneous viewings in the future

&gt;&gt; **/u/Flychageo**: That sounds like a great idea but as of right now most of our community have such a varied schedules that this could only work for 4-5 people per week. I think that this would be a great idea if we could get a larger viewer base so that we could have aton of people chiming in at the same time.

&gt; ##What goes on when it's an ""Anything goes"" day? That sounds wild.
&gt;&gt; **/u/whowhatwhere11109** ""Anything goes"" weeks are scheduled every 3-4 weeks. These are weeks where we will be accepting movie nominations from any genre! It will allow us to shake things up and let subscribers think outside of the box and recommend some interesting movies from a wide variety of genres. I anticipate getting a set of awesome nominations on ""anything goes"" weeks!

&gt;&gt; **/u/Flychageo**:  Anything goes days are when we allow people to vote upon whatever they want


&gt;##Best movies I've watched on Netflix Instant recently (ones that haven't been featured in the sub)

&gt;&gt; **/u/whowhatwhere11109** The Imposter, Take Me Home, The Giant Mechanical Man, Safety Not Guaranteed, Butter, Lars and the Real Girl

*[Answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/17p7xr/dr_who_the_doctor_wont_tell_anyone_his_name_so/)

I can't write fan theories, which it's just better for everyone if I don't. Even when my kids were babies they'd reach up and put two chubby little baby fingers to my lips and shake their heads as if to say, lets just enjoy this bonding moment in silence.

The closest I ever came was a storyline I wrote on /r/MadMen last year in answer to the question: what ever happened to [Chauncy](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fv9-5mFHxvU/UL_mkxDk__I/AAAAAAAAAMY/tOhxm7nYRfs/s1600/Chauncey.PNG) after [Duck abandoned him on Madison Avenue in the dark of night](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW4sbWvPs-Q). I wish reddit search would let me find it, he shaved his face, donned a turtleneck and suitcoat and, like Don/Dick, changed his identity to [Ted Chaough](http://www.lippsisters.com/2012/05/29/the-elusive-mr-chaough/), started his own agency, and out of misplaced loyalty to Duck


I think if you love fan theories you will also love /r/shittyfantheories. And if fan theories showing up on your favorite TV/Movie/fan subs bug you, you'll miss all the [commenters expanding on the theories](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/192rt7/the_green_giant_is_long_dead_they_just_use_his/c8knv07) and miss out on all the subsequent mind blowing, as well.



&gt;##1. How was /r/shittyfantheories born?

&gt;&gt; **Schmogel** As for most shitty subreddits there's a nonshitty counterpart. In the case of /r/FanTheories I realised the need of a dumping ground for elaborate but far-fetched nonsense. These submissions [are really entertaining](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/uyprl/yodas_parentage_a_theory/) but don't follow the rules

&gt;##2. Are there any shitty fan theories that you like better than the original story they come from?

&gt;&gt; **Schmogel** Has to be [this story by thebenolivas](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/yfuew/well_rfantheories_didnt_like_my_theory_on_finding/) and I don't understand why /r/FanTheories didn't approve. Maybe that's why:
At a key point in the film, hides with it the true meaning of the film – letting go of the past.


&gt;##3. Do you have any favorite shitty fan theories?

&gt;&gt; **Schmogel** This [one by cabothief](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/144cpm/one_of_the_weasley_twins_is_adopted/) has a high level of you're-full-of-shit-I-like-you.

&gt;##4. Is there anything new subscribers should know

&gt;&gt; **Schmogel**
Feel free to post what's on your mind. Even real theories are appreciated if you can't find enough evidence.
I'd be happy to read many new submissions!


&gt;##5. Is there anything else you'd like to add or plug?

Thanks Schmogel! And thanks all you shitty fan theorists!

21.544 Paper managers for 2 years

My uncle used to work at a little office as salesmanager. I never knew what they sold there though. I once visited him while he was working

/r/DunderMifflin is devoted to the show The Office. The show is placed in the office of a fictional paper company
The boss of that office is regional manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell)

If you want more information visit our page

Once you watch The Office 



If you haven't seen the show: **Go watch it**. Seriously.

Cause

So how about the subreddit?
A few weeks ago I was wandering through this big place called reddit

I talked with /u/Cokecan4z
A small world

&gt;#1. How did you get into The Office
&gt;&gt; **Cokecan4z** I got into the tv show The Office because Steve Carrel's awesome acting abbility

&gt;&gt; **hero0fwar** I watched the UK show for a while, I knew I would love the show. 

&gt;&gt; **atticus138** My friend /u/Groosalugg talked it up for quite some time, I immediately marathoned the entire series and have been hopelessly addicted since. 

&gt;#2. Is this subreddit also devoted to the UK version
&gt;&gt; **Cokecan4z** This subreddit is devoted anything ""the office""

&gt;&gt; **hero0fwar** We don't discriminate



&gt;#3. Who is your favorite character? Why? Who do you love to hate? Why?
&gt;&gt; **Cokecan4z** My favorite character currently is Toby, but now after seeing him go up and down in life, just trying to make it, there is a part in my heart for Toby now, and when the Scranton Strangler confronts him, I know he will come out on top....im getting a llitle ahead of myself.

&gt;&gt; **hero0fwar** Favorite.... probably Creed, no reason needed other than the fact he is Gabe.

&gt;&gt; **atticus138** This is a tough one... Probably Dwight or Creed.

&gt;#4. Do you think The Office was still good after Michael left?
&gt;&gt; **Cokecan4z** Michael never left, but still lacks on the character development, which in my opinion, the writers have given up on and moved to more of the romance side of things(which isnt bad but if anyone needs love in the show, it NEEDS to be someone in the ANNEX) 

&gt;&gt; **hero0fwar** I still watch every week. Sure it is missing something

&gt;&gt; **atticus138** The show definitely took a blow when their top star left, well established cast who (in my opinion) proved they could carry on without him. I think it's a good thing they're calling it quits after this season, though... The series has run its course.

&gt;#5. What is your favorite episode/clip?
&gt;&gt; **Cokecan4z** Fav episode? id say the first episode! why? cause it started the great community we have now.

&gt;&gt; **hero0fwar** I really love anything with Michael Scott in it. 

&gt;&gt; **atticus138** My favorite episode may be S02E10 [""Christmas Party""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664513/) Michael's childish behavior at Christmas time is fucking hilarious. [YANKEE SWAP!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klwVaAa_8YA)

&gt;#6. What is your favorite quote from The Office?
&gt;&gt; **Cokecan4z** ""NOOOOOO

&gt;&gt; **hero0fwar** ""may your hats fly as high as your dreams"" - Michael Scott

&gt;&gt; **atticus138** This has changed so many times over the years!! Lately I have been partial to [this scene with Michael and Toby.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5d5jxJ5vbM)

&gt;#7. How is the community like?
&gt;&gt; **Cokecan4z** The /r/Dundermiflin community goes up and down

&gt;&gt; **hero0fwar** Good people


&gt;&gt; **atticus138** Oh, die-hard fans around here. The discussions, theories, jokes, etc. are always quite enjoyable. /r/DunderMifflin, /r/PandR and /r/Modern_Family are three of my favorite sitcom subreddits because the community members are all so great. 

&gt;#8. Anything else you'd like to add?

&amp;nbsp;

Yes folks

    For every rule there is an exception.

Both these subreddits are blood related adorably cute sister subreddits. Kpop is the 1 and a half year older one and Kpics is the younger more simpler one.

Today is July 4th. [And I thought this was Merica!](http://i.imgur.com/fljye.jpg) So get over it. Is your hissy fit over? [Good.](http://i.imgur.com/zicvx.gif) Lets move on. I had to preemptively say that, [really get all up in arms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A) over what we do around here. Listen, we are just a bunch of guys and one sad drunk woman... What you thought I was going to continue *that* rant again? Wham bam no thank you ma'am. So lets get back to the festivities.

Ah yes, fuck you work, I'm an adult! I'm going to sleep in today and eat chocolate bacon for break fact, lunch, dinner, 2^nd break fast and 2^nd dinner. IN YOUR FACE COMMUNISM. Oh right, and the day America became independent from Britain aka Independence day. You know

Here is the thing, extremely catchy, color coordinated matchy(?) musical talented kind over in /r/Kpop. But wait there is more^Say-it-like-Billy-Mays-would . Lets say you live in a world where you just can't phantom listening to music out of your comfort zone. Thats fine, someone has to be the partypooper. Just [set your phasers to cuteness overload](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziw3nHCHEJw) instead and get your ogle on in /r/Kpics. Good times will be had.

Let me simplify it even further. 

/r/Kpop = Korean pop music and related stuff.

/r/Kpics = Pictures of Korean pop stars.

ABCs people gotta stuck to my ABCs.

###Interview(s) on the way.

P.S. There are other similar subreddits like /r/Cpop &amp; /r/Jpop for Chinese &amp; Japanese pop music subreddits respectively. But they don't come close to the sexiness of /r/Kpop.

&gt; 3 Which korean singer / band are you most addicted to? Why?

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** In no particular order I like: 2NE1, Epik High, and House Rulez.

&gt;&gt;**schrobby** [IU](http://i.imgur.com/6KRjM.gif). I love all K-pop, of course; nothing creepy here.

&gt;&gt;**fiveSeveN_** I like Clazziquai, BoA, Sentimental Scenery, House Rulez, Acoustic Collabo, Junggigo, Hwayobi, LeeSsang, Younha, The Quiett

&gt; 4 Tell us about yourcommunity.

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** In the beginning people complained about image submissions and so we made a rule. And then people complained about not enough image submissions and when we thought about making a rule more people complained that it wasn't a problem and they liked it the way it was. But clearly some people didn't. And so I decided to make /r/kpics and it turned out to be a great idea. VA also made /r/jpics if Japanese is more of your kind of thing.

&gt;&gt;**schrobby** kjoneslol basically mentioned everything relevant already. People wanted images of their favorite idols

&gt;&gt;**fiveSeveN_** It's a great community aside from the problems that kjoneslol described. I think that their biases get the better part of their judgment when it comes to voting

&gt; 5 If you could go on a date with any Korean pop artist who would it be?

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** That would be an impossible dilemma between [Hyosung](http://i.imgur.com/wo7Eg.jpg) and [Lee Hyori.](http://i.imgur.com/7xbT1.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**schrobby** Well

Hey everyone: get in here. This place allows you waste time and learn new things *at the same time*
it's like the pinnacle of everything reddit is about! It includes such noble life-enhancers as ""Shuffle a deck of cards one-handed"", so tell all your friends! Still not convinced? What if I were to tell you I can flip a stack of beer-mats, 10 high, with each hand, at the same time, and then catch them again? What then? It would convince you not at all, but it'll sure make you try it too:D


And now


&gt;## What is your own most useless talent?

&gt;&gt; **Billobatch:** All of my ""useless"" talents are my babies. But if i had to select one it would be the fact that i can do a roll or wave with my fingers. I am still in the process of putting up a how to for this, and it appears that a wave is rolling through your fingers. It's hard to talk about with a visual but a guide will be up on /r/learnuselesstalents soon. It's not easy to be able to make it look smooth and beautiful.

&gt;&gt;  **tomsawyer101:** Magic. I know some bar tricks really well but I am a terrible magician

&gt;&gt; **felix1429:** Definitely pen spinning. I've invested hours into it and has yet to net me any benefit.

&gt;## What spurred the creation of this subreddit? Billobatch

&gt;&gt; **Billobatch:** This subreddit came about because I enjoy learning this like this. Little things like rolling a quarter across your fingers or solving a Rubix cube. I made this because there is no other place on the internet that tells people new things that are just cool to learn. In all honesty, that's cool looking! I'm going to try that"" and they fail. Horribly. I look awesome, and it kills time when you're not impressing people. The reason this was made was selfish. I wanted to know about more things like that and couldn't find anywhere else on the internet to discover them. I knew it would be a good idea, and other people think so too. It's been fifteen days and we have over 1,600 subscribers. The only thing i have ever posted was a link on /r/newreddits and Felix posted a link on /r/shamelessplug (i believe the subreddit is named that) all of the rest were just people thinking it was a good idea.

&gt;&gt; **tomsawyer101:** I saw it was a new subreddit and I figured ""Oh

&gt;&gt; **felix1429:** I know Billobatch personally
 
&gt;## Would you prefer to be useless and have everyone think you are talented

&gt;&gt; **Billobatch:** Useless and have everyone think I'm talented. I'm a very loves the limelight person

&gt;&gt; **tomsawyer101:** Interesting question, Apollo cursed her so know one would ever believed Cassandra when she told the future. This caused her much strife throughout the rest of her life. So yea I'ld rather be a fraud and everyone just think I'm awesome.

&gt;&gt; **felix1429:** The second. At least then I can earn money.

&gt;## What kind of things do you want people to post here? What is the ideal submission to /r/learnuselesstalents?

&gt;&gt; **Billobatch:** I want people to honestly post things that they think are little known and cool. Things that impress people or kill time. Let's be completely honest, you're so talented! No one else here can do that! That makes you better than all the other guys! HAVE YOUR WAY WITH ME!"" That's how most of my fantasies end. Not ""have your way with me"" in a creepy Fifty Shades Of Gray kinda thing. I'm not into ropes. Don't need them. My ideal submission would be something that I have never seen done before. When a person sees it and they go ""wow, I have nothing seen anything like that"" we hit a jackpot.

&gt;&gt; **tomsawyer101:** I like PotatoMusicBinge's answer hahah.

&gt;&gt; **felix1429:** Anything that's awesome but can't really help you in life. The ideal submission would be a tutorial for something totally epic and obscure that would increase your chances to get laid.

&gt;## Anything else you want to say? Friends to greet? Enemies to scorn? Obscure causes to plug?

&gt;&gt; **Billobatch:** People to greet? Well, otherwise, Bob Barker will try to get them pregnant. He has a serious problem, help them man out by making his drunken mistakes not be another person gay children will have to look after someday. Well... Unless you don't give them rights. You horrible person you.

&gt;&gt; **tomsawyer101:** Heed these words: You will pay for what you have done Neal Rodack

As I lay here, to the episodes watched and liquid pride shed (Butterfree episode. You know the one), I have donated at least a week of constant time to Pokemon, and have no regrets. I didn't keep up with it throughout the years, but my love never faded. I can still sing [the pokemon rap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njYB2meovaw) from memory, and must've played the main theme on a dozen different instruments. The games a big piece of the pokepie, so when I found out that there were community made games? It's a good thing there's a laptop in my bunk.

/r/PokemonRomHacks is the hub for these fan creations, but it was damn close. I'm sorry that I don't remember the hack's name as I've changed computers since then and don't have the file. My penance shall be most severe. Until then, though, let's talk about rom hacking.

While my knowledge of rom hacking is simple at best, but I haven't seen one since the 90s and I doubt they're made any more. The most specific way to do this is through a direct editor, [but graphical editors do exist](http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lm/).

I got in contact with the pokemon trainers behind the subreddit in order to ask them a couple questions. Under penalty of law

&gt;#1. Firstly

&gt;&gt;**BrownieBiznatch** I'm 22 years old and I freaking love Pokemon! I am a college student studying to be a doctor (pre-medical biology major). I became a mod at the subreddit around May last year and instituted a couple of programs that really made the sub grow. I became head mod on December 31st last year.

&gt;&gt;**Kaphotics** People may know me from Smogon, and love playing Heroes of Newerth &amp; Dota2.

&gt;&gt;**360RPGPlayer** I've been hacking Roms for around 4-5 years under the alias of ""chickoritaMudkipz"". It began with a youtube channel playing them, Canadian, and I believe I'm the newest mod to the sub.

&gt;#2. Pokemon has a cool history

&gt;&gt;**BrownieBiznatch** I first started playing when I was 8. I got Pokemon Red as a birthday gift from my best friend at the time. His birthday was a couple days later so I got him Red too and we both started with Charmander. I ended up spending the night and we played Pokemon all night and watched Dr. Doolittle.

&gt;&gt;**Kaphotics** My first ever videogame just so happened to be Pokémon Red. I had never owned a videogame system before

&gt;&gt;**360RPGPlayer** I first started with Ruby/ Sapphire. I went back and played gold and silver

&gt;#3. Do you have any favorite pokemon? How about favorite hacks?

&gt;&gt;**BrownieBiznatch** My favorite Pokemon is Charizard

&gt;&gt;My favorite hack changes more times than I can count haha. Right now, which is awesome. Other ones that I really like are any of the Ruby Destiny games (destinedjagold is a genius), Pokemon Fuligin, and Pokemon Azure Horizons, which was the first hack that I ever played.

&gt;&gt;**Kaphotics** Favorite Pokemon is definitely Axew

&gt;&gt;**360RPGPlayer** My favourite pokemon is probably chickorita. It's just so cute. My favourite hack is shiny gold X

&gt;#4. If you were to give some advice to a first timer

&gt;&gt;**BrownieBiznatch** Play as many hacks as you can. Once you figure out what you like and what you think works well in a hack

&gt;&gt;**Kaphotics** Even if you don't know anything related to programming

&gt;&gt;**360RPGPlayer** Don't be too ambitious, usually finishing one is enough.

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch fellas. Anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;**BrownieBiznatch** You guys are awesome! Don't hesitate to ask questions in the subreddit! We feature a different hack each month so check us out and play the featured hack along with the rest of the community!

&gt;&gt;**Kaphotics** Be sure to check out our Hackdex in the sidebar for a huge catalog of ROM Hacks!

&gt;&gt;**360RPGPlayer** The sub helps with everything from playing hacks to making hacks. We're just pokemon enthusiasts that like fan made content. Also

Wonderful indeed. This is a rare thing: more Pokemon. Fuck yeah. Huge props to /r/PokemonROMhacks

One of my earliest memories is a conversation I had with two kids from across the street. I wasn't really paying attention: I was mostly just watching the way their faces moved when they talked

But it stuck in the back of my mind and this was just the first of many times I'd hear those crazy assertions from seemingly out of nowhere. It kept coming up. I needed to find out for sure. But how? A few things had to happen first:

1. I needed to learn to read
2. I needed to find a partner who provided the key to unravel the truth. She remembered hearing someone say ""if it ain't in the dictionary it ain't a word'."" 

We had our plan.

But to first get our hands on a dictionary and look it up? At school? [Nuns](http://i.imgur.com/esrZB.jpg). [Nuns](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/002735475/nuns-are-mean-79995774427_large.jpeg) everywhere. The public library? ""What are you girls giggling and going on about back there?"" No


I am a bit of an anomaly

And so

I have a confession. Sometimes I put people on my friends list and don't know who they are or remember why I put them there. I am like who the fuck is this and why are they here? This happened again recently and some unknown username led me to the sub we are here to talk about today. I clicked on their submission to figure out just who they were

As time goes on, and may want to know too. You may have questions about [your special area (NSFW)](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zjvx7/those_bumps_on_your_dick_might_not_be_warts/) or someone [else's special area,](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zighf/women_of_rsex_have_any_of_you_gone_from_enjoying/) or the special times [when those special areas meet.](http://www.angelfire.com/il2/simpsonsfun/sounds/ralpharea.wav)

We can't all go back to my family's family room, so what better replacement than /r/sex? What better friends to find out with? The fellow subscribers there.

~~Even though the boys all went to the Altar Boy Picnic


&gt;##1.How did you become involved in r/sex?

&gt;&gt; **Maxxters** My best friend introduced me to reddit. He saw that I was kind of bored when he went to reddit.com on my computer

&gt;##2.Do you have any tales of a time, when you had a sex question and encountered barriers to getting accurate answers? What did you go through trying to find out?

&gt;&gt; **Maxxters** Recently, which makes it that much better. When I was younger I had great sex ed in school. It was more a case of me not knowing what I actually didn't know and figuring it out once I became sexually active. I was able to ask my friends things and go to the internet. Now I can talk to my parents about anything, but back then I wasn't totally comfortable with that.

&gt;##3.When I was growing up, parents who told their children their wee-wees and hoo-hoos were penises and vaginas. They just weren't my parents. What were you told were the names of your special places?

&gt;&gt; **Maxxters** My parents called them penises and vaginas (it helped that I had a younger brother... changing diapers became an anatomy lesson of sorts). Although I do remember arguing with my Mom and sister that it was called pagina not vagina when I was about 4. 

&gt;##4.What do you like best about r/sex?

&gt;&gt; **Maxxters** The really interesting discussions we have

&gt;##5.Is there anything you'd like future subscribers to /r/sex to know about r/sex?

&gt;&gt; **Maxxters** We're a sex positive, we police it quite strictly. Absolutely no personal attacks, no hate-speak, derogatory language or 'jokes' about rape or objectification are allowed. No questions at all are off limits, but we do have FAQs/Most Asked Questions at the top of our community that people really need to check before posting. Lots of people come to us in a panic and seriously think that they're the only ones to ever go through this and then they quickly see that not only is it common, but it's one of the most asked about topics that we get in /r/sex. 

&gt;##6.Anything that you'd like to say to your current subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Maxxters** The vast majority are amazing. They go out of their way to help others, or just providing moral support and encouragement. We all learn from each other here and it's pretty amazing to see all the different perspectives on sexual issues. 

&gt;##7.Is there anything else you'd like to add? or promote?

&gt;&gt; **Maxxters** I think that the community speaks for itself. There's nothing I can say that's more compelling than just visiting /r/sex and reading through the discussions that we have here.

Hello loyal readers! I was at first at a loss at which subreddit to feature. How do I show my appreciation for such an awesome holiday? Then it hit me: (Actually it hit jmk, I'm aware of other aspects/traditions that contributed to what XMas is today. I've engorged myself on chocolate and chicken wings all day, and would like to go to bed. You're all more than welcome to discuss any of the solstice shit in the comments.)

Anyways, or to it's place in modern discourse. I *certainly* don't object to those people's objections, but that's not what this post is about. I'm not here to talk about the Crusades, the Reformation, or the Great Schism. I'm not here to talk about priest molestation charges, condoms, abortion, and on a day about peace on Earth and goodwill towards men

outsider

&gt;What inspired you to moderate this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;out: I wanted to help it be a better place

&gt;&gt;kay: I actually wasn't interested in moderating this subreddit because I worried it would harm my credibility with the many atheists and agnostics I've been friendly with here

&gt;&gt;rain: I love reddit as a platform. I love the way it creates online communities. While I go to church


&gt;&gt;Moderating our subreddit can be problematic. We step in as little as possible, to the effect that we're constantly forced to consider our role. I hope I'm believed when I say that one of our highest priorities is to protect and in some sense nurture our atheist subset, most of whom are legitimately interested in engaging Christians on a personal level. That having been established, our goal is to maintain a space where the focus is Christianity and not the many alternative worldviews.

&gt;Many users on reddit are former Christians. Why do you think you've stayed with your religion? What does Christianity do for you that other religions don't?

&gt;&gt;out:This will probably come out far harsher than I intend it because I don't intend it to be harsh. I don't think many former Christians had a well developed sense of Christianity before they left it. There are of course exceptions but when I see someone state that they left Christianity at the age of 8 and that that small period of time was enough to know apparently everything about Christianity I am kind of hesitant to take their knowledge claims at face value. There is a wealth of Christian thought and philosophy in the Early Church Fathers both Pre- and Ante-Nicene Fathers that not only makes Christianity interesting but intellectually stimulating. It isn't that other faiths lack these things but my phenomenological experience has been that they lack one or more things which my faith does not. They also address many questions and issues that I think many Christians or former Christians today struggle with due to being either unaware of their existence or having not read much of them. I would, Eastern Orthodox, and also the early Reformers, who had shaped Christian theology and interpretation of the Bible. It might be akin to reading the writings of Thomas Jefferson or James Madison to understand the US Constitution. For me, I was an adult convert. I was irreligious growing up and from the age 5 to 25 I had probably gone to church (or any religious center) 5 or 6 times (my memories before 5 are pretty fuzzy these days). There is always the elephant in the room of ""personal experience"" that many Christians seem to share that was something I was never able to relate to beforehand. I had to drop a few pretenses prior to being able to relate to ""personal experience"" and it eventually made sense to me, that and the falsifiability of Christianity (that if Christ's body was discovered than Christianity would be proven false) both adequately addressed my intellectual resistance to Christianity. This is also something which other religions did not do for me and for that matter what some modern aspects of Christianity did not do for me either. It would be difficult for me to go into detail about this without being perceived as slandering other religions even though it is probably clear that I disagree with them on theological matters.

&gt;&gt;kay: The epistemic bar needs to be extremely high for one to dedicate one's entire life to any belief system, without being thoroughly convinced foremost of the existence of a deity. But I reject that such a level of ""intellectual"" acceptance of God's existence is necessary for one to be serious about belief. We have existential reasons for belief, evolutionary reasons for belief, pragmatic ones and whimsical ones, aesthetic ones and utilitarian ones. (One might say the same argument should be made in defense of pink unicorns, but they sadly lack the juggernaut of religion in their support.)

&gt;&gt;Yes, and practical underpinnings to the faith. I'll stray from those and say simply that I believe, to paraphrase Chesterton, that a religious philosophy is very important, and I think Christianity presents the very best religious philosophy. It presents the most coherent worldview. It speaks across cultures, intellectual barriers, ideological divides. It embraces paradox, light and grave, nearly logical

&gt;&gt;What Christianity has for me (and has for everyone, dangerous, sensitive, intellectual, hope-bearing, love-giving, life-inducing incarnation called Jesus Christ. Taller than any leader who ever thought himself tall. Humbler than the lowest servant. Wiser than the most erudite scholar. A man whose sharp tongue spoke out in defense of the poor and oppressed, for all the contempt he bore, the Lord of every lord.

&gt;&gt;Describing the rise and fall of the leaders of western civilization he had seen over his life, sullen supermen and imperial diplomatists, there stands the gigantic figure of one person, because of whom, by whom, in whom, and through whom alone mankind might still have hope: the person of Jesus Christ.""

&gt;&gt;rain: I think each time I almost walked away from Christianity there was someone there to point out that rejecting whatever it was that was bothering me didn't necessarily mean rejecting the whole of Christianity. Recently, not Christianity"". I really resonate with that. You'll often hear fundamentalists lament about how few ""True Christians[tm]"" there are, when in reality they are lamenting about how few like-minded fundamentalists there are. In truth the larger historic Christian tradition is a wide stream with plenty of room for asking questions and testing the waters. Almost every time I hear an argument against Christianity I think, Well, I agree with you, but not all Christians believe that and I certainly don't.

&gt;&gt;I'm altogether fascinated with the person of Jesus. Even if one day I cease to believe in a god, oppressed, and marginalized.

&gt;What do you think is the most important religious issue today?

&gt;&gt;kay: Certainly a case could be made for any number of things, and strength; love your neighbor as yourself - the church has been and is unfaithful. For every missionary doctor donating his time to fix cleft palates, there's someone bombing an abortion clinic or picketing a funeral. Yes, Christianity has been responsible for answering needs all over the world, but it's also responsible for more far hate, bigotry, inequality

&gt;&gt;(As an aside, ""There are some upon this earth of yours who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, and selfishness in our name, not us."" Christ said many who consider themselves Christians will

&gt;&gt;In a word

&gt;&gt;rain: Coming to terms with religious diversity

&gt;What misconception about Christianity would you like to correct?

&gt;&gt;out: Not all Christians stop their education at high-school or avoid hard-sciences nor are all young-Earth creationists or literalists. I couldn't do my job if I fit the bill of any of those. In fact I would argue that those are minority positions in worldwide Christianity even if common perception is skewed with some of the vocal religious makeup of the USA. I could probably go on and on with this question but I get the sense that you would prefer I not spread out my answers too much.

&gt;&gt;kay: That we all care whether the clerk says ""Merry Christmas

&gt;&gt;rain: When someone calls themselves a ""moderate Christian"", they mean that in the spectrum of conservative to liberal understandings of Christianity, they fall somewhere in the middle.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Christianity?

&gt;&gt;out: You guys and gals are all doing a pretty good job of maintaining some of the most civil conversations on reddit. I hope we do a good job of moderating the subreddit.

&gt;&gt;kay: Thank you for representing a side of Christianity many people have never encountered before. You're a motley bunch, liberty; in all things, charity. I love this community because of what you've made it. Also, don't feed the trolls.

My car isn't a great one. It's a 1988 Crown Victoria with more problems than features, but my baby. Its worst problem was when the engine fell out of the bottom and took a bunch of important looking stuff with it. Other problems included the engine shooting strange liquids at me and the window shattering rolled down. Always there was a mechanic there to help me out.

/r/JustRolledIntoTheShop is a place for mechanics and confused people to reflect on the strange and damaged vehicles that come into the shops. Whether there be a nest of birds on the gas tank or a bowl of jelly in your oil filter

Something I like about this subreddit is how simple it is to someone like me who doesn't know a thing about cars. I couldn't tell a brake line from, all my car knowledge comes from Top Gear and whatever I learned from various friends over the years. The community puts everything in easy to understand terms without a whole mess of lingo.

I wish I could say more good things about this subreddit, but I think a mechanically-inclined person would have a better time.

I contacted /r/JustRolledIntoTheShop and received a very surprising and warm response from their mod team. I asked them questions and

&gt;#1. Firstly

&gt;&gt;**Nightshade3312** I am an auto tech/college student/blacksmith. I graduated from a technical high school with all 8 of my NATEF certifications for gasoline automobiles and light trucks. I worked a year fixing cars/taking out the garbage in a body shop (got laid off in 08 market crash) then decided to study mechanical engineering after graduation. After two years of that I couldn't sit behind a desk any longer and transferred schools to a place that would allow me to get my degree and study blacksmithing (my dream job) under a mentor with 30 years of experience. I'm currently keeping my head low renting a room in a sketchy neighborhood (cheap rent because I'm saving as much money as I can to graduate.)

&gt;&gt;**xG33Kx** I'm actually a second year Computer Networking student (going for a bachelor's)

&gt;&gt;What inspired me to start this subreddit? I poked deep through my comment history, then actually got down to it. He even came up with the name.

&gt;&gt;**fdisk2053** Well there is not much to tell. I'm a rather DIY kinda guy myself. I never went to school for automotive mechanics

&gt;&gt;After the Army I got a job working at a Nissan stealership. I hated the place.. I had this asshole boss that was always looking for a reason to fire me because I called him out on bullshit every time in front of customers when he attempted to screw them over for some bs service they did not need or tried to fuck over a co-worker.

&gt;&gt;Aside from my career

&gt;#2. What type of cars do you all drive? Have you ever been the one rolling into the shop?

&gt;&gt;**Nightshade3312**  My first car is a 1985 Chevy Citation X-11 with the 2.8L fuel injected V-6 (currently 75

&gt;&gt;Next car was a 1998 Chevy Cavalier with 180, power steering leaked from the pump, and the final straw was when the wheel bearing started failing. It was worth more in scrap than it was if I sold it, so I junked it for $250, engine still ran perfectly to it's credit. Didn't have the time to fix its issues and rust. This one would have rolled into the shop if I could afford the bill.

&gt;&gt;**xG33Kx** I drive the aforementioned car with a habit of breaking down, but it was only $650, except I've poured like $700 into keeping it running). I love it when it's running besides the color, but soon should be in a financial position where I can trade up.She's frequently rolling into the shop it seems. Here's the damage I can remember:

&gt;&gt;Fuel pump

&gt;&gt;Fuel tank

&gt;&gt;ECU

&gt;&gt;Battery (Just fixed another no-start with my dad

&gt;&gt;Ignition coil

&gt;&gt;[Pics of her when I picked her up](http://imgur.com/a/az3bG)

&gt;&gt;**fdisk2053** I know I'll catch hell for this

&gt;&gt;As far as rolling into the shop myself

&gt;#3. What have been your biggest challenges to overcome since coming onboard at JustRolledIntoTheShop?

&gt;&gt;**Nightshade3312** I love moderating JRITS, the post stays. So I don't have to overcome many challenges besides getting to a computer throughout the day, cleaning the spam filter, and holding discussions with the subscribers and my fellow mods about the future of JRITS. Very minor challenges.

&gt;&gt;(Rules 4, our banner was made by a subscriber, etc. It really is a joy thinking of new things to do for the sub and its community. I try my best to help keep the sub fresh and running smoothly whenever I can.)

&gt;&gt;**xG33Kx** It was my first subreddit

&gt;&gt;**fdisk2053** None really. We have a great staff of Mod's

&gt;#4. Do you have a favorite post? Let's see it!

&gt;&gt;**Nightshade3312** My favorite post is the first one that made me laugh before I was a mod [(the sub was 3 or so days old)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/rl5fk/why_you_should_never_run_over_a_mattress/)

&gt;#5. Thanks a ton for the answers. Is there anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;**Nightshade3312** Thank you, keep all of the original content coming. Almost 1 year of JRITS!

They are all part of DC Comics and according to me the most fucking awesome comics in the history of comics (purely my opinion. please dont kill me)

I am a HUGEEEE COMIC LOVER. I read many comics. Let it be mangas, garfield, calvin and hobbes, peanuts, local comics or any other comic possible and the comic which i fell in love with first is DC comics which has a great deal of loving memories in my life :')

Of course the comic fandom has always the debate of which is better [DC or marvel](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/11412/Avengers_vs_JLA.jpg). I say both are awesome in its own special ways. I mean both have features which the other cannot compete :D 

DC comics have a variety of heroes ranging from superman to teen titans to aquaman to justice league and soooo many more. Their popularity is immense. Many of the characters have been turned into movies, is referenced in so many books, regular articles, movies and you name me one child who doesnt know who superman is :P :D

DC Comics is undoubtedly one of the best comics around. If you want to start you should look into the new 52 series which are going on. they are fuckin awesome! :D

I am a [HUGE KYLE RAYNER FAN](http://th00.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/167/b/d/kyle_rayner_by_nagarayarrm-d3inyc3.jpg). According to me Undoubtedly the most kickass green lantern ever (again hal jordan

so here is a nice interview with the mods!

&gt;##1. what motivated you create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**maidenfan2358:** I created the sub about four years ago
**dgehen:** I was invited to join as a mod after a ""tryout"" in /r/Nightwing. Needless to say
**upgrayedd69:** I saw that there was an opening for a mod spot


&gt;##2. who's your favourite DC character and why ?
&gt;&gt;**maidenfan2358:** Jay Garrick, before the New 52 reboot. He was pretty much everyone's granddad, the one you trusted to tell about some of the mischief you'd gotten away with.  
**dgehen:** Batman has always held a special place in my heart, his personality and positive outlook makes him easy for me to relate to.   
**upgrayedd69:** I would have to say my favorite is Tim Drake. Couldn't really say why



&gt;##3. which was your favourite DC comic till date ?
&gt;&gt;**maidenfan2358:** Transmetropolitan &amp; Planetary. It's a tie. Transmet is a Vertigo title, but an examination of the genres that superheroes can encompass.  
**dgehen:** Batman: Year One is definitely my favorite DC story
**upgrayedd69:** My favorite comic from DC was from their Vertigo imprint

&gt;##4. do you like the new 52 ? if yes which all do you follow ?
&gt;&gt;**maidenfan2358:** I'm enjoying the New 52. Right now I'm reading Death of the Family (Batman titles crosover), (Green Lantern titles crossover) Earth 2, Superman Beyond and Justice League Beyond.  
**dgehen:** Overall, Wonder Woman, Action Comics, Swamp Thing, Animal Man, Batman Inc, Aquaman and The Flash. Also from Vertigo I've been reading American Vampire, it is a bit of a shame to lose the expansive and fascinating history that was the DCU.  
**upgrayedd69:** I have my problems with the New 52. DC doesn't seem to know what is canon and what isn't. Batman and Green Lantern's histories are pretty much untouched, we are just gonna have new #1 issues."" That being said, I do enjoy a good amount of titles from the New 52. Batman and Robin, Batman INC, Acton Comics, Superman, Wonder Woman, Threshold


&gt;##5. Do you like marvel or DC ? and why ? :D
&gt;&gt;**maidenfan2358:** Some of my first comics were DC. Some people can tell you the very first comic that they'd ever owned. I can't, I was just that young and DC has been a part of my life for that long. As for Marvel, I read their titles much more than DC as a teen, but I've never found myself blown away by a Marvel book. Crisis on Infinite Earths did that. Identity Crisis did that. Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #2 did that. (""The Lonely Man"" story) I really haven't been moved by a Marvel book.  
**dgehen:** For the most part, except for Deadpool, for budget reasons, but hear All New X-Men is fantastic. I do have to give a shout out to Image Comics for giving us the masterpiece known as Saga by Brian K Vaughan - writer of Y: The Last Man. Probably the best book out there.  
**upgrayedd69:** I prefer the characters in DC, Daredevil, Hawkeye, and X-Factor are all terrific. The biggest drawback of MARVEL is that they want to charge a dollar more on many of their books for absolutely no reason other than they can. Amazing(Superior) Spider-Man, pretty much all the X-books, Avengers, Iron Man, et al. are the same number of pages of story as every other Big Two book


&gt;##6. do you have anything to say to the present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**maidenfan2358:** ""Just Imagine: Stan Lee Creates the DC Universe"" was
**dgehen:** Make sure you actually subscribe to comics through your local comics store (LCS), it's important to the industry to support your LCS, but for comics to continue to survive, you have to start supporting the digital medium. Most of my monthly titles I read digitally through Comixology. One thing about Comixology is that it allows readers to buy comics through their LCS if they have a [digital storefront](https://retailers.comixology.com/).  
**upgrayedd69:** For future subscribers

For the people who have no clue of what is going on: Sorry. Rollercoaster is a pc based game which gives you control over an [amusement park](http://i.imgur.com/k815a.gif)! You can create all kinds of attractions, and with that money you buy attractions, engineers, cleaners, parks and lots of other stuff! You can even make your own rollercoasters and envy the guests who take a ride.

But the most important question is: can you kill the guests? [Yes

I played it a lot when the first game came out, parks and stuff than in creating my own rollercoaster. I think it was because the first rollercoaster I made crashed, causing *a lot* of deaths and panic. Yea, that park got closed pretty soon.


I went with the moderators to six flags, and talked about the game and the subreddit.^(our experiences may differ)

&gt;#1. What was your first RCT game
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** First rct game was rct1. I downloaded the demo and was hooked ever since.

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** My first game was RCT2

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** An old friend introduced me to the original RCT when I was about 8 or 9

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** My first was the first. I've been playing it since the beginning.

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** My first RollerCoaster Tycoon game was the first - RCT1. My older brother had the game and both expansion packs. He was a lot better at it than I was. I've also played a lot of RCT2


&gt;#2. What is your favourite part from the serie?
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** Favourite is rct2 without expansions. It has just the right mix of objects and tools to build anything. Also

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** My favorite game in the series is RCT2.

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** My favourite game in the series is definitely RCT2

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** The entire concept of the series is fantastic. It is a game accessible to kids that makes incredibly difficult topics like engineering and business management fun.

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** My favorite thing to do is to manage and design a profitable, geese hang out on lakes and quack if you click on them. Everyone in the park stops walking around to clap for you when you finish a scenario.

&gt;#3. What do you like the most about Rollercoaster besides making guests vomit?
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** Tycoon besides making guests vomit?
Personally

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** The thing I like the most about the series is how much freedom you have. Drowning guests and building really intense coasters is only fun for so long

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** I like to spend my time in RCT creating killer parks! (as in good

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** I must be one of the few people that doesn't like to do that in the game. Anyway

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** It is very simple and easy to learn. However, but others may find more joy in making a realistic park or designing scenery.


&gt;#4. What is your favourite way to irritate guests?
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** Favourite way to irritate guests is charging for washrooms.

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** I generally don't annoy my guests

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** Irritating guests? Who'd want to do such a thing?! Nah

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** I haven't done this, usually glass, cage for them with a few signs and everything, and leaves the guest in there indefinitely. The guest is trapped, which is kind of fun. But it also becomes a bit of a ""where's Waldo"" kind of game whenever he submits a park.

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** Increasing the prices of umbrellas during a rainstorm is opportunistic, but the guests can get confused.

&gt;#5. Do you play by a formula/is there a certain way you play the game?
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** I have no formula when I play. I usually see something in real life and is inspired to build something.

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** As mentioned above I take my time when building parks

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** How you play the game is down to a players own style

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** I mean, But I can get crazy.

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** I hardly use scenery at all in my parks
I also try to remove inefficient pathing systems. The paths should be straight and in a grid in order to make travel between rides as quick as possible.



&gt;#6. Do you prefer the tiger
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** Panda entertainer is favourite by far. Although the sheriff and bandit ones are cool too. 
My favourite attraction is twister roller coaster. It's by far the most versatile coaster type with launch hills and inversions. You can make it tame

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** Panda entertainer all the way.

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** I like the tiger! My favourite attraction has got to be the merry-go-round

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** The Sherrif and Bandit are my favorite
In the game as well as in real life

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** Here's a modified answer.
Do you prefer the tiger
I hardly ever use entertainers. When I do, so I like giga coasters a lot.


&gt;#7. Confession time: how many guests have you drowned?
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** 
Surprisingly I've drowned more mechanics and handymen than guests. Guess I'm a terrible boss to work for.

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** I've lost count of how many guests I've drowned

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** I've lost count!

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** Guests? Maybe 2 in my decade+ of play. Usually accidentally. I have made a lot of things crash

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** Probably around 2500. There was one large killing of about 1800 guests a few years ago

&gt;#8. What can we find on this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** On this subreddit

&gt;&gt; **ZaQri** Poonish_ answered the last two like I would. :)

&gt;&gt; **dinosaurfour** On /r/rct you can find a dedicated mod-team ;) as well as some excellent work, and more.

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** Content related to any of the three games! We have live streams of the games, tech support, custom in-game content, tutorials, and articles. We love getting and giving advice on projects from players of any skill level. This community has certainly helped my skill in the game.

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** Extremely well-designed coasters. There's less of a focus on completing scenarios because there's not a lot of depth to the gameplay compared to completely custom parks. We definitely do not want to hear stories or videos of how you kill your guests - everyone's experience with that is exactly the same.


&gt;#9. Anything else you would like to add?
&gt;&gt; **Poonish_** I would like to add that everyone is welcome to submit cool ideas and what not to the sub as long as they follow the rules in the sidebar. We won't bite

&gt;&gt; **PHScale** Stop on by and show us your skills! We love fresh content!

&gt;&gt; **Doomed** A lot of people get tripped up accidentally on the abbreviation of RollerCoaster Tycoon. It's pretty simple -- RCT.
We'd love to see new members trying out the games and submitting their work to the subreddit. There's a huge wealth of information contained in our sidebar, etc.

Enjoy your day and be sure to check out the game (again)!",self,t5_2sgno,1370975396.0,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1g3r0k/june_11_2013_rrct_create_sell_build_an_empire_and/

When it comes to medieval combat most gamers will instantly think of classic games such as Age of Empires and The Elder Scrolls along with many other varieties of Real Time Strategy or First Person Sword games. If you look at forms of entertainment such as movies, I’m ashamed to admit I’ve never actually played AOE or Total War or Skyrim (at least not properly) but I have played Oblivion and am [a huge fan of medieval stuff.](http://i.qkme.me/3u8bnf.jpg) So it’s fair to say it’s a rather popular genera and still going strong with new releases of games like Total War and Chivalry. But now I’d like to shine the spotlight on the game series Mount and Blade or more specifically its Subreddit /r/mountandblade. This is a Real Time First Person Role Playing Game or RTFPRPG for short. Still isn’t really that short is it? 

Mount and Blade starts you off like most RPGs with a backstory influencing your stats. From this point onwards the world is your oyster

In terms of gameplay you've got your typical roam around hunting for quests and enemies on the over world map. There's cities to explore and trade in and villages to pick up recruits, charge and so on. In my game I've assigned my own personal bodyguard who could easily mop the floor with me but luckily they're quite loyal or so I've been told… What you do in the world is really up to you. Join a faction, become a Lord, plunder villages and hell even start your own Kingdom in later games.

Now in my opinion this is a good game but thanks to /r/MountandBlade they've helped make it one of my favourite games of all time by just one simple word… ***MODS!*** Before you get excited ^*Cough* ^^/u/JaxSpider ^*Cough*, one such example is [Diplomancy](http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?topic=116424.0) which adds loads of minor features to make day to day ruling that little bit easier. Every little helps and all that. How about not being a leader and instead become some random mook in an army? You guessed it, there’s a Mod for that! Granted it’s (usually) not the main selling point as [Floris Mod Pack](http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,148140.0.html) is a huge game overhaul with loads of shiny new things and [in game cows](http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/5341/tevarincowssmall.jpg). As an Irishman this is a very impressive feature. Or if you fancy another awesome game overhaul there’s the [Prophesy of Pendor](http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,126952.0.html) except it doesn’t have milkable cows so it’s obviously not as good. There is also a [Game of Thrones](http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?topic=194575.0) mod which although currently pulling a Duke Nukem is looking pretty damn impressive. Now I realise that most if not all these mods are for Mount and Blade Warband but I've always considered it to be a Mod of the original so it’s all good. 

But that’s not all! It’s also a fantastic resource for both new squires and seasoned veterans. I've picked up plenty of tips which have really helped me rule my Kingdom. Turns out Peasants really dislike it when you loot their village. How was I supposed to know? There’s also plenty of clever tips on making an easy profit and on dealing with those pesky rebellious Lords.

Since this writeup is getting a bit long in the tooth or as I like to call experiencing First World Hamster problems it’s time for the *SUBREDDIT* MOD interview. Because interviewing a program would be just silly.

&gt;##1. When did you first think “This game needs a subreddit”?

&gt;&gt;**Uniboximus** Can't really answer this one - the creator of the subreddit is no longer a mod and I think he's deleted his Reddit account

&gt;##2.  What’s your favourite Mod(ification)? 

&gt;&gt;**Uniboximus** M&amp;B has an outstanding modding community, I'd have to say either Prophesy of Pendor or the Floris Mod Pack. And of course the Napoleonic Wars DLC has a very large and active community.

&gt;##3. Is RTFPRPG (Real Time First Person Role Playing Game) the right term to describe this game?

&gt;&gt;**Uniboximus** Hah, on the other hand, is geared more towards action/fighting fans. As mentioned previously, both MP and SP have a variety of insane mods that can completely change gameplay and cater to the interests of all players.

&gt;## 4. What’s your greatest in game achievement/moment?

&gt;&gt;**Uniboximus** I'd probably have to say winning BIT. For anyone unfamiliar with the Warband competitive scene


&gt;##5. What’s your favourite submission to /r/mountandblade?

&gt;&gt;**Uniboximus** I thought it was really cool/flattering when the Taleworlds devs made an appearance

&gt;##6. Now’s your chance to tell your community something

&gt;&gt;**Uniboximus** Loves you all.

My love fur bears began when I was a little kid. It all started with the [bear in the big blue house](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yHu_FZUu8k). If you know this show then your childhood was awesome (Well
I still want to hug that big, pawesome, cozy and [always happy](http://i.imgur.com/gz3zQ.gif) acting bear.
But if I knew which day I would die
Well, but it's worth the shot. And then my name will be added to the probably short list of ~~idiots~~ heros who tried to hug a wild bear.

And there is a reason not many people would try that. Bears are in real life huge scary animals, those are impossible to break). Their use of scratch is so effective that they could beat every gym leader with only that single move. 

But once they imitate us

And this is what /r/bearsdoinghumanthings provides you: pictures/gifs/videos of bears doing human things. And it is awesome. These are the kind of pictures which make you say aww more than the frontpage of r/aww. 

But the real question you should ask yourself is: should we be afraid? 

Why, they *observe* us. We think they are just being cute, but slowly they are moving towards global domination. This may sound ridiculous and absurd, but in the far future, when we are all slaves building King Krogar's statue, I will laugh and yell: ""I told you so!"". It will probably be followed by a rope hitting my back mulitiple times, but it will all be worth it. 

But now it's time for the interview.
I had a talk with head moderator /u/Coenn

&gt;1. How did this subreddit got created?
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** It was created [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/10gns7/introspective_bears/c6dddjw?context=3)! It was more of a joke

&gt;2. When and how did your love for bears began?
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** When you recognize the human in a bear

&gt;3. What do you love about bears doing human things?
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** They can be everything if they act human. The scary and enourmously strong animal becomes silly and funny when just placed on an old couch

&gt;4. Team Grizzly or team Polar?
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** Looking on the content in my subreddit; I have to say Team Grizzly. Polar bears live in a kinda empty enviroment (the objects to make the bear act human in some cases are not present) so most content on the subreddit is from other bears than polar bears. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Looking on just bears; I think I'ma go with polar bears

&gt;5. What is your favorite submission?
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** Lately [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/bearsdoinghumanthings/comments/18r208/bears_acting_italian/)

&gt;6. Could this imitation behaviour lead to a world wide takeover? If so
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** Secretely, I hope they spare me, or at least make me head-slave. I've got this all figured out.

&gt;7. How is the community like?
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** The community is a big plus in this subreddit. Everyone is nice and enthusiastic. This behaviour of the community drives people to upload more content and have friendly and nice discussions in the comments. The only true issue people have with eachother is if there is content uploaded in which the bears are obviously being abused to make them do human stuff (for example; 'dancing' on a hot plate).

&gt;8. Would you like to say anything to future subscribers/current subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **Coenn** Surrender to the bears. Join us to *maybe* have a chance to survive the bear-world-domination.


I hope you enjoyed! And it's March people! Soon spring will come and we will be freed from winter! *All hail King Krogar!*

A community for **1 year** with **18

If you are a cinemagraph virgin let me quickly assuage your fears: I know it sounds like something to do with old clunky film equipment from the golden era of the talkies, but unlike its light-emitting and ground-avoiding brethren the cinemagraph is already among us. You can get one right now, at the touch of a button!

So what is this marvel of science? The sidebar of /r/cinemagraphs has a more detailed description (and mod Chickens_dont_clap will expand on it in the questions below) but essentially a cinemagraph is a photo with a little bit of looping movement. Sounds familiar? Isnt that just a gif?. [It is not](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ). The differences are subtle, a cinemagraph is photographically conceived; it is essentially a still image which has a tiny element of movement included as a colouristic highlight. To be a cinemagraph you should be able to hang it on your wall, like the portraits from Harry Potter. For example, [man playing trumpet for a waterfall](http://i.imgur.com/sWRsZ.gif);  [japanese bukakke convention](http://i.imgur.com/FERUo.gif), and [cup of liquid nitrogen](http://i.imgur.com/qEbAH.gif) would all grace the stateliest of homes with aplomb to spare. Aplomb streaming from every orifice. 

/r/cinemagraphs, share and discuss this uniquely 21st century artform. As one of the largest (Is it the largest? Who knows. Google probably, but never mind that) forums dedicated to magic moving photos on the entire internet, subscribing now is a great opportunity to drop yourself right into the vanguard of what will someday be a legitimate, establishment-sanctioned form of artistic expression, and to see some cool pictures to boot.

Here is super-mod Chickens_dont_clap to fill us in on all the hot goss from the Cinemagraph industry:


&gt;## What is a cinemagraph? What is the difference between a cinemagraph and a .gif?

&gt;&gt; **Chickens_dont_clap:** Cinemagraphs are a relatively new medium
The biggest mistake that I see in crappy cinemagraphs is when someone says ""I have this video and then I isolated movement to just one area
The simple act of isolating movement to one area of a .gif does not magically transform the .gif into a quality cinemagraph. What about the lighting? The framing? The atmosphere? The colors? The treatment of light and shadow? The rule of thirds? The treatment of geometry? The handling of contrast? To ignore all those things is to just make a .gif that has isolated movement. There is a place for those

&gt;&gt; **hoodatninja:** In the most simple terms, too low quality, etc. then it's most likely not really a cinemagraph.

&gt;## How do you make a cinemagraph?

&gt;&gt; **Chickens_dont_clap:** There are a few apps for making Cinemagraphs. Making them manually is a pretty complex and difficult process. You should start with a clip of source video and import the frames to a photo editor like Photoshop or Gimp. Then you choose the part of the image where you want to retain movement and isolate that part in each frame

&gt;&gt; **hoodatninja:**  Carefully. Think through it


&gt;## What are you looking for in a cinemagraph

&gt;&gt; **Chickens_dont_clap:** To me, what’s important is that the cinemagraph conveys the atmosphere of the subject, whatever it may be.

&gt;&gt; **hoodatninja:** This kind of goes back to 1) and 2)


&gt;## Can you link us some of your favourites?

&gt;&gt; **Chickens_dont_clap:** [This is my favorite Cinemagraph](http://fromme-toyou.tumblr.com/post/7123283532/the-kettle-can-wait-this-couple-sells-jewels)

&gt;&gt; **hoodatninja:** Wow there are so many I can't even begin. While most of these are kind of sloppy


&gt;## Is there anything else you would like say to potential subscribers

&gt;&gt; **Chickens_dont_clap:** To potential subscribers I just say welcome and we’d love to have you help us build this relatively new medium.

&gt;&gt; **hoodatninja:** Just do it! Try to make one or give pointers on people's! You can have no idea how to make them--just let people know what doesn't work (within reason, and join an active and appreciative community",,False,self,t5_2sgno,1341784078.0,WRITER,

It should. Reddit has literally thousands of shibboleths. Ice soap? 4am chilli? And of course: “the narwhals bacon at midnight” which is particularly interesting because the phrase itself is not a shibboleth, whats the wackiest/weirdest/coolest/most unusual subreddit you know of?"" and scroll down through it you will sooner or later come across /r/ggggg. It’s just one of those things. 


I have to admit, veiny thoughts about featuring it. There are so many fantastic subreddits out there that I really had to consider the ethics of promoting what could be seen as a novelty act. Serious business! But although this pony only has one trick, it performs it wearing the interesting beret of an intellectual. /r/ggggg is the most focused subreddit there is. It has no [meta] posts. No sidebar instructions. No friendly little reminders cleverly embroidered within the CSS. And yet, the community maintains its course with a unity of purpose, a *purity* that is as awesome as it is terrifying. You can go to the frontpage and click next as much as you want, scrolling right down to its very bottom, and not one sign of dissent will you find. It’s like one of those secretly murderous utopias that were so popular in 80’s sci-fi. And the most amazing thing is its activity.

Like Barak Obama, and other peers, we at SROTD don’t like to use our power to feature the subreddits we mod.  However, due to certain circumstances, more specifically Christmas, I wasn’t able to get a mod from another subreddit to answer a few questions (Thanks a lot, Jesus). So

r/gentlemanboners is a community to get your daily fixing of classy, JMaboard to answer a few questions for me. In return, JM asked me to answer a question of his own. Read on.

&gt;What is r/gentlemanboners?

&gt;&gt;Gentleman boners is a subreddit made for pictures of classy women
not pictures of gentlemanly boners
that's r/classymanboners

&gt;What gave you the idea to start gb?

&gt;&gt;r/ladyboners. MiraP was obsessed with Ladyboners,000 subscribers strong. 

&gt;Awww shucks. I’m blushing. What does each mod bring to the table?

&gt;&gt;MiraP: Well

&gt;&gt;Kappafox: He's basically the voice of reason and a mediator

&gt;&gt;Jax: He said he would change the css

&gt;What’s with having Zach Braff as a mod?

&gt;&gt;I decided he'd make a great celebrity endorsor of this subreddit...although I never asked him

&gt;Is there anything else you’d like to add?

&gt;&gt;Two things. 1.) To the people pm'ing me pictures

To answer the question, for the most part, very proper and not crass, which is nice.

""Frisson"" as google search describes is stated as ""A sudden strong feeling of excitement or fear; a thrill: ""a frisson of excitement"".""

I am pretty sure everyone has had this feeling multiple times in a life. I still remember the motivational program my dad had put me in long back when they showed [this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1GWBB7qrBA) I could feel everyone's including mine heart racing after that finished. These small moments of thrill are amazing and cannot be described later on but when we are during that moment we feel like we are in a whole different world!

These strong feeling which sends shivers to very bottoms of our spine come sometimes in day-to-day life from various reasons and scenarios.. videos


Here i am with the mods of this sub for an awesome interview!

&gt;##1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**girafa:** I was motivated because I saw the fickle Transient Users killing the sub with mundane ""omg so many feels"" fodder and the fascist part of my brain desired strong moderation to purge out the fluff.  
**TheSimpleArtist:** I came on board, hoping to bring a new perspective to the table. It's certainly a great team to work with.  

&gt;##2. Which is your all time favourite post ?
&gt;&gt;**girafa:** [That flash mob playing Beethoven's 9th.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1bpkmb/video_flash_mob_performs_beethovens_ode_to_joy_in/)  
**TheSimpleArtist:** [The speech that was never-read. The statement Nixon was supposed to read had the astronauts from the Apollo 11 astronauts been unable to return back to Earth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/y2sci/statement_for_president_nixon_to_read_in_case_the/)  

&gt;##3. How would you define the feeling of frisson in your own words ? :D
&gt;&gt;**girafa:** Frisson is any time your emotions trigger physical goosebumps.   
**TheSimpleArtist:** It's that sensation that starts right in the base of your spine, and any gripes seem insignificant.  


&gt;##4. How is your community different compared to the other subs ?
&gt;&gt;**girafa:** It's different in that it's (as least striving to be) an interactive archive of frisson-inducing stimuli, and /r/askscience regarding the strict labeling of our submission titles.  
**TheSimpleArtist:** I think girafa nailed this one.  

&gt;##5. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**girafa:** Future subscribers: if you've ever said ""so many feels"" or ""who's cutting onions?"" I don't want you in this subreddit :)  
**TheSimpleArtist:** Present subscribers: I look at every post on the subreddit. Keep them coming!

Startups are awesome. I am sure everyone knows what it is today. Some years back i could have sworn i never heard of it but in today's technologically moving world this my friends is the buzzword. 

As wikipedia defines it, generally newly created, are in a phase of development and research for markets."" .. So... basically they are the small companies which are gonna revolutionize the world ? i guess so! :D  
All Startups are started with an idea. A small spark which people decide as worth spending their time on and build on it. It takes great dedication, startups are small and allow us to stretch our imagination to its limit and work on it making a better world. reddit itself was a startup at one time with a small team who built this big cat-loving, nickelback-hating, reposting, breaking bad-loving site! hahaha :D

Of course startups are very risk taking. Lack of preparation, unsuitable ideas can be disastrous. So we need to be very careful going through this path. But the end victory is very delicious! Startups weren't known well before but after the internet industry exploded, they became the buzzword in the silicon valley and spread throughout the world and i believe will lay the path to the future of the technology.

Here's an awesome interview with the mods!

&gt;##1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**kishi:** I'm part of a local startup community that has been really supportive of my startups
**KingOfDaCastle:** The top admin was asking for help on IRC and I offered to help because I already moderate a handful of subreddits and like the startup community.


&gt;##2. Are startups awesome ?
&gt;&gt;**kishi:** Startups aren't awesome. They take a lot of work
**KingOfDaCastle:** I enjoy watching people take control of their own lives, for people. Those are the kind of people that are the most fun to be around and will make the biggest difference in the community they are involved in (and perhaps the world).  
**PLURFellow:** Startups are awesome. You leave the beaten corporate path and have the opportunity to create your own. It is brutal and you get exactly what you put in.

&gt;##3. Do you have any experience yourself with the startups ?
&gt;&gt;**kishi:** I'm part of 2 startup teams
**KingOfDaCastle:** I have been working on my current startup
**PLURFellow:** Yes. 2 previous


&gt;##4. Is there any startup story you want to readers to know about ?
&gt;&gt;**kishi:** All of my startups have just happened to me. I'm just talking to an expert
**KingOfDaCastle:** I don't think there is any one story
**PLURFellow:** [I think this is a good place to start.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LZU8oa2RqQ) Appsumo founders started their website here on Reddit


&gt;##5. What do you think are the main requirements needed to be able to build a successful startup and go forward ?
&gt;&gt;**kishi:** Talent talent talent. Recruit the best talent you can find
**KingOfDaCastle:** A good product and a willingness to sell it. That sounds generic, technical basis, patents, etc. A willingness to sell it means you, as a company, are able to generate customers. Doing both of these things takes a myriad of skills, but I don't think there is a certain recipe. Things never work out the way you planned
**PLURFellow:** Drive. You can make up for anything lacking if you have drive. It's also the thing even the smartest people can lack and leads to traction.


&gt;##6. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**kishi:** Ideas are worthless; every startup pivots as they learn their market. The true value of a startup lies in its team members.  
**KingOfDaCastle:** This community is only as good as the people who contribute to it. If you want to make it better
**PLURFellow:** Join us. We're the only place on the internet giving free and unbiased critique/advice. Your friends and family are nice people and dirty liars.

Have a nice weekend everyone!

I LOVE ANIME AND MANGAS. I LOVE BLEACH.

If anyone of you know me even a little bit

Bleach is a manga which is one of my favourites. Its been made into an anime but lately discontinued .. i hope it comes back :( Written by [Kubo Tite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tite_Kubo) It basically hovers over the concept that that when a person dies

A shinigami basically has a sword or [*zanpaktou*](http://oi41.tinypic.com/2qio3us.jpg) which is like a key using which a soul can be sent to the soul society. Now the interesting part is these swords can be used for fighting! (of course they are swords .. so they should be used for fighting &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) but the interesting thing is that these swords can be transformed to different weapons depending on the individual which is called as a [*shikai* form](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4479/486532-haguro_tonbo_anime.jpg). Also some chosen shinigamis can wield the second more powerful form of the sword which is FRIKKKIINN AWESOME! [Its called as *BANKAI*](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/391/19156-ikkaku_bankai.jpg). It normally goes like this ..  when they release it btw --&gt; [BANKKKAAAIIIIIIII *whoooosssssssssshhhhhhhh* *bankai's name*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA-n_R5Wy18) :D :D and they power up!

Of course like all series

The main character of the series is a guy called [""Ichigo""](http://images.wikia.com/bleach/en/images/d/d7/Zangetsu.PNG). I really dont know *what* he is &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; .. You would understand what i mean if you saw the series :D Anyway

I wish i had a bankai which could transform me into something like [this](http://desktop.freewallpaper4.me/view/original/3299/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii.jpg) .. sigh if only ... oh well..

If you are getting into animes

sorry fro the long article and interview in advance btw .. its possibly because i fell in love with the series :D

Here's a kick-ass interview with the moderators!

&gt;##1. what's your favourite bleach character ? why ?
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** Ukitake has always been my favorite character. He always seems to be on the right side of things. I love the somewhat annoyed
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** Ulquiorra because I loved the way his character grew as the story progressed. Personally
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** Definitely Gin. He started as such a sly, sarcastic bastard and only right at the end did we find out his true intentions.  
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** Easily Starrk. This dude just doesn't care

&gt;##2. who do you think is the captain that has impressed you a lot till now ?
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** I think Kuchiki has been highlighted the most/undergone the most change. He went from being the main vilian to ally and for a long time seemed to be the measure of power in the bleach universe. I think he's an easy character to relate understand
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** Gin. Not only did he make Ichigo's skills look subpar without trying
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** Can I say Aizen? Just kidding
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** If we're counting past captains

&gt;##3. do you think ichigo should become a captain ? who do you think should be his vice-captain or should ichigo be a vice-captain or some other postion of somebody else ?  
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** No
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** I think it's something that should be available only to those of soul society. He is still alive
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** Personally I'd say Ichi shouldn't become a captain
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** Personally, he should be respected as a captain, but while he's still alive and not yet moved on to Soul Society as an actual Shinigami, I don't see how he'd maintain a squad or get there in time when Soul Society is under attack. As demonstrated by the last attack on the Seireitei.


&gt;##4. what is ichigo ? :D
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** That's a hard question because we know really nothing about Isshin. It could be Isshin's powers are just plot device and really there only to partly explain that Ichigo had some latent powers all along, and has incredible reiatsu. Perhaps he was involved in creating some of the things that became soul society as part of the Royal Guard. I'd put Isshin somewhere in the Royal guard as well, and Ichigo was the son he shouldn't of had...  
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** A Deathberry :P He is basically whatever Kubo wants him to be. I'm waiting for Kubo to introduce a new race, part hollow, part quincy, part fullbringer?   
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** Some sort of human/shinigami/hollow/vizard/fullbring/Quincy thing In short
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** Human, Shinigami, Fullbringer, Saiyan, Dragonborn, Hokage, Cetra, and Hardcore Gangsta Rapper.  

&gt;##5. what is your theory of isshin ?
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** Whoops :) To add though I'd have to say that Isshin fled to the human world to protect Masaki who was actually a Qunicy or something
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** I think Isshin was part of the Shiba clan
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** I gotta say ex-zero squad
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** The theory I like is the one of how he's an ex-Squad 0 member. Seeing as each Squad 0 member invented something, and why they've never shown the squad symbol on the back of his haori. He probably got exiled for (Spoilers ahead) falling in love with and having a kid with a Quincy.

&gt;##6. if you could become a captain
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** I don't think I'd take that position. I think I'd be more interested in doing things on my own and hiding out in the human world causing trouble :)  
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** Probably the 4th squad
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** I'd take the technology bureau
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** Probably Squad 3. They seem to just be able to kinda hang out, and was still pretty well-respected until the traitorous things started being recognized. I think I'd fit in there.

&gt;##7. which is your favourite arc ? which was your favourite part in it ?
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** I really liked the first arc because we still didn't know where the series was going and what role Ichigo played and if he was going to get strong enough to protect Rukia. The fights in that arc were very cool to see animated too :) Best part though is when Ichigo stopped sokyoku and after that this part was just great because we really had no idea what power's he had now: http://youtu.be/oCNvgW6tW1U?t=5m  
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** Have to agree with Synyster here, the Ulquiorra/Ichigo final showdown. I still shudder when I remember the gaping hole in Ichigo's chest and his lifeless eyes.    
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** The first arc was my favourite because the show was like nothing else I'd ever seen. It really opened my eyes to just how good anime can be.    
As for my favourite part
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** My favorite arc would have to be the FKT Arc. A lot of bankais were revealed pretty much awesome fights all around. But out of all of them, and Ulquiorra's death was really well done.  
If not that


&gt;##8. which is your favourite fight till now ?
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** Hmm
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** Ulquiorra/Ichigos final match. It was fantastic in many aspects. It revealed so many level ups
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** Gin vs. Toshiro
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** Byakuya vs Ichigo will always be up there for me. But inconsistencies presented later in the show kinda make that fight seem like Byakuya was only fighting at pretty much half power that entire time
But Starrk v Kyoraku was pretty well matched. And Starrk pretty much gave up near the end since Lilynette died, and only die because he let down his guard and essentially gave up on the fight because he felt alone again. THE FEELS.


&gt;##9. do you have anything to say to your subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** Just
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** Thanks so much for making the community better and for being open to all the changes and giving us great suggestions. It's been great being a part of this community.  
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** Thanks for all the suggestions and for being such a brilliant community
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:** Keep being awesome. From the time I've started until now we've grown a lot as a community


&gt;##10. do you have anything to say to kubo ?
&gt;&gt;**t0lk:** An AMA would be very cool! :D   
&gt;&gt;**darkangeO4:** Thank you! And looking forward to the next...what 8-9 years?   
&gt;&gt;**Xyphious:** In short
&gt;&gt;**SynysterScene:**WHERE THE HELL IS HICHIGO?   


Have an awesome wednesday everyone! :D

Welcome! If for whatever reason you're new here and have not been paying attention, himself only existent for a split second due to quantum perturbations in the interdimensional ether. Said celebrations are divided into four Theme Weeks, each more exciting than the last, and will culminate in a feat never before attempted on reddit. This, the second week, is nsfw week. 

Picking a subreddit which is both nsfw and which would fit in with the /r/subredditoftheday ethos was, many hours of trawling through the toilet of human depravity which is the *random nsfw* button and boy are my wrists tired (from taking notes). The main problem is that as much as possible I want to feature a place with a sense of community, and a lot of the nudey reddits are, uh, a bit.... *narrow* in their purpose. They have a job to do, and they do it. The nsfws that do have that special community vibe have then sometimes a different problem, namely that they are too specialist. I'm sure the folks at /r/cartoonzoo (very nsfw btw) are fine upstanding citizens

Luckily

For too long our red-headed brethren have feel the cruel heel of popular mockery. Even on such a supposedly enlightened place as reddit they are the butt of countless unfunny jokes, but its all fun and games until someone declares a war. So hopefully /r/ginger can teach you to empathise with this oft abused part of the human collective by first getting you to fancy them.

Hey brothers.

Last time we featured them 7 months ago, there are **24,813** people making huge mistakes.

RETRO WEEK RETRO WEEK RETRO WEEK

Oh how glad I am we're having a retro week in celebration of /r/subredditoftheday's 1 year anniversary! When I joined the mod team a few months back, most of them were taken. Including /r/ArrestedDevelopment. It should come as no surprise that as soon as I heard we were having a retro week, I typed ""Dibs on Arrested Development"" as fast as my ~~man hands~~ delicately small hands can type.

Now, I watch a lot of TV. Mainly because ~~I don't have a life~~ I have Netflix. I'm sad to say I didn't start watching AD until after the show was cancelled and all three seasons were on DVD. But when I finally saw all the season, I literally blue myself. 

The first time I saw it, I don't mean the show (although Community is great too. You all you should watch it). As a frequent visitor of /r/ArrestedDevelopment, I love seeing the posts whether it be yet another subtle hint that many of us didn't catch or a question asking us what our favorite Tobias moment is. BTW, did you know he's the world's first [Analrapist](http://i.imgur.com/qvd9A.jpg)? He's quite good. He really gets in there and makes you feel it. I mean I don't think I've ever felt so great with [a man inside me](http://i.imgur.com/q6IiY.jpg). He really got me so in touch with my feelings.

But I have to say

It wouldn't be a proper Arrested Development writeup if I didn't say [I've made a huge mistake](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-im2F-ziV0sk/T1UDzWJ3XKI/AAAAAAAAA0E/RgJC0VBqQCc/s1600/ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif) and [there's always money in the banana stand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuHILqDIvis) (along with NO TOUCHING!)

To tell us a little more about the subreddit


&gt;##1. ~~Who'd like a banger in the mouth?~~ On a scale from 1 to STEVE HOLT how excited are you about the new season and movie?

&gt;&gt; ~~I forgot. Here you call it a sausage in the mouth.~~ I think that our community is collectively very much excited about the new season. With the recent AMA of Justin Grant Wade, I see no reason why we couldn't double our numbers for the next retro week!


&gt;##2. Who's your favorite character on the show and why?


&gt;&gt; I think I have to say my favorite character is GOB. I always loved his eccentrically


&gt;##3. I know a few people who just aren't interested in watching Arrested Development. Your rebuttal?
More questions to follow after these are answered!

&gt;&gt; I also have a few friends who don't watch it. On the one hand, have watched the series multiple times to catch all the little gems that Mitch Hurwitz and the writers squeezed into the series. Not everyone has the patience for that. Some folks may also not be able to keep up with the show since it doesn't employ laugh tracks, and is faster paced because of it. In reality, you're getting the ""laugh quotient"" of several episodes of your typical comedy sitcom (Big Bang Theory not included) crammed into the 22 minute episode. Oh, and don't forget that the ""On The Next Arrested Development"" bits aren't.

And to make everyone laugh a little

*For the glory of Agatha!*

Chivalry is one of the most basic games ever created. In Chivalry, without much else to take into account. It's true medieval warfare, and I can't get enough of it. Yet, below all that, Chivalry pisses me off. Stabs that I'm sure went through my shield, or swings that look too far to hit and yet take my head off are common problems. Others are the idiots that run around with fists, teamkillers, and of course hackers. Chivalry is very much a game that can be amazing when done right

I listen to music when I play Chivalry. Specifically, I play as either a Man-At-Arms or a Vanguard. My MAA setup is a Falchion, Saber, and Heater Shield. When a Vanguard, I use a Claymore, Saber, and Throwing Axe. Of course this changes on the situation, but that's the general stuff. When I play I prefer either FFA or Team Objective. My favorite maptype of all time is where you either defend or protect the king. Last time I played I got King of Kings by surviving for so long; it was an incredible game. Enough about me

I figure you all must know by now that /r/ChivalryGame is about Chivalry, as well as post images that might make you exhale air at an increased rate. Sometimes they get together and play Chivalry. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they sell bees to unsuspecting children. That's not true.

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**AerateMark** I'm 19 years old

&gt;#2. Tell me about your first Chivalry match. How about your latest?

&gt;&gt;**AerateMark** My first chivalry match was painful. I don't remember hitting someone

&gt;&gt;My last match was pretty annoying. When I get deep into a game, it becomes muscle-memory based playing, which emulates what I do when I'm concentrating and playing well. (Or at least, that's how my own playing comes across at these moments.) It went rather badly, but I don't actively play anymore, so I don't care too much.

&gt;#3. What tips would you give to someone just starting out?

&gt;&gt;**AerateMark** Just keep playing. Take advice, any SSB game or The Showdown Effect.

&gt;#4. What's it like moderating the Chivalry subreddit? Any stories?

&gt;&gt;**AerateMark** Spam. Lots of spam

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch

&gt;&gt;**AerateMark** This subreddit isn't modded well all by myself, go play NoX if you like good balanced PVP with swords and magic and shit (/r/NoX, literally shameful plug and shit)

All those gifs with that [much style](http://i.imgur.com/AhsA6.gif) and [crazy cool dance moves](http://i.minus.com/iWFMbjiYIyWxW.gif) was just too much to handle for some. The elderly [fainted.](http://i.imgur.com/L1Ola8K.gif) Anger was [building up.](http://i.imgur.com/dc0pL.gif) Cats were deployed to calm the masses.

&gt;1 How did /r/whitepeoplegifs come to be?

&gt;&gt;**DezTiny** /u/Zti  &amp; I were brought on about 5 days ago to do the CSS but I'll answer away anyway. I always thought reddit was (mostly) against Racism but it seems it likes to keep its Gifs nice and segregated.

&gt;&gt;**APOPTO5I5** I came on board a couple months after the inception of whitepeoplegifs so its beginnings are unknown to me. I can

&gt;&gt;**hazyanlazy** I really cant say as i have been here for short but very fun time.

&gt;2 Whats your favorite /r/whitepeoplegifs?

&gt;&gt;**zti** [This](http://i.imgur.com/QsYv5nP.jpg) one is my favorite

&gt;&gt;**DezTiny** Oh that's a tough one

&gt;&gt;**APOPTO5I5** To pick one would be far too difficult today

&gt;&gt;**hazyanlazy** Mine has got to be this one it makes me laugh every time http://i.imgur.com/Zt4iQXN.gif.

&gt;3 Whats the best part of /r/whitepeoplegifs for you personally?

&gt;&gt;**zti** Pretty much all of the gifs are great

&gt;&gt;**DezTiny** The Gifs that people submit are often ridiculously funny and I love that. But doing the CSS with /u/Zti was awesome and the users that helped me test it.

&gt;&gt;**APOPTO5I5** The sub reminds me on a daily basis that while I may be a white and nerdy individual

&gt;&gt;**hazyanlazy** Its how everybody just comes together and has a good fun time through hilarious gifs

&gt;4 Will there ever be enough /r/whitepeoplegifs?

&gt;&gt;**zti** No there will never be enough.

&gt;&gt;**DezTiny** As long as there are white people doing silly things and camera's then there will always be /r/whitepeoplegifs. It's a fact of life. (and maybe the universe).

&gt;&gt;**hazyanlazy** No i cant say there can ever be to may white people gifs so unless they some how run out keep em coming.

&gt;5 Tell us about your community?

&gt;&gt;**DezTiny** It's a community of people laughing at silly stuff white people do. What's not to like?

&gt;&gt;**APOPTO5I5** A group of individuals that recognizes and appreciates the goofy nature that white people tend to exude.

&gt;&gt;**hazyanlazy** Its just a bunch of people coming together laughing ad having a really fun time!",self,t5_2sgno,1364323498.0,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1b1gg1/march_26th_2013_rwhitepeoplegifs_lets_all/

**996 gif requesters and gif makers for four months!**

Some words'meanings (whether correct or not) are frozen in my mind from the first time I heard them.

I mean I'd heard the word gif before but it hadn't yet made much of an impression. The year: 1996. I was in college. I was at my college job. I shared my office with the boss. My boss talked on the phone all day. I listened. Not on purpose but I *was* sitting [less than four feet away.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/xfiles-dunno.gif )

Her male friend was upset and had just got fired for having 400 gabillion giga or mega (or whatever were excessively huge in 1996) bytes of gifs of porn on his *work* computer.

Gay porn. 

Not that there's anything wrong with that. But it was still a time when you could get fired for just being gay (and I know, as I pictured him talking on the other side of the phone. He also had white hair in my mind for no real reason.

400 gabillion and gif stuck with me


Now gifs have another meaning, emotional response* for each and every occasion!

But when I try to make my own [I'm all.](http://i.minus.com/ibshBe3fOuiMHn.gif)

And then I feel almost as humiliated as 400 pound white-haired newly unemployed guy with too much porn on his work computer... 

Luckily, it's all love and support here! And professional competence!


Well here are the mod interview questions:
&gt;##1. Are you all expert gif makers?

&gt;&gt; **sprite144** I guess you could call us that. I think Matt and Dick might be slightly better than me

&gt;&gt; **matt01ss** Yep! All three of us have made hundreds of gifs each for various requests. We have had a lot of exposure to many different projects.

&gt;&gt; **dickfore** Expert? I can make youtube clips into gifs in a minute no problem

&gt;##2. Are there any subreddits that *you turn to for help for things you can't do?

&gt;&gt; **sprite144** I can only think of one example. Somebody wanted a Nigel Thornberry gif made so I suggested he try r/nigelthis.

&gt;&gt; **matt01ss** I have not. I actually had done my own research on a few ideas for approaching gifs. I did however get a great amount of information from /u/Pays4Porn on gif compilation with great compression. It seems we have become that subreddit people turn to for things they need help with!

&gt;&gt; **dickfore** Regarding making gifs? No. But regarding other things

&gt;##3. How did the sub get started?

&gt;&gt; **sprite144** Well

&gt;&gt; **matt01ss** I'm sure sprite will love to answer this one.

&gt;&gt; **dickfore** Whatever sprite says.

&gt;##4. Do you have any favorite or most memorable gifs that were made here?

&gt;&gt; **sprite144** That's a tough one. I've made hundreds of gifs for people. It's always memorable to me

&gt;&gt; **matt01ss** This is a great question that is very difficult to answer. We have fulfilled hundreds of requests thus far
I would say that the most successful one I've completed would have to be the [Downvotinator.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Makemeagif/comments/13352o/045_109_downvote_gif_please_request_details_in/)
It was an excellent idea and I had a lot of fun with it.

&gt;&gt; **dickfore** Absolutely. I made [this](http://i.imgur.com/yhsM084.gif) for someone soon after I started using Adobe After Effects

&gt;##5. Do you have any advice you'd like to share with future visitors and subscribers

&gt;&gt; **sprite144** Us gif creators can do much more than just make a gif from youtube videos. I'd really like it if people would start requesting for gifs to be combined. I've made a few of them and they have all turned out to be funny.



&gt;## That's great to know I always felt like I was being a pest to ask for too much

 &gt;&gt; **matt01ss** My advice would be to start small. Learn some of the basics on how to make a good gif. The amount of work you put in will equal the quality coming out. Many people are concerned that good gifs take a while to make

&gt;&gt; **dickfore** Watch the videos on the sidebar. I knew absolutely nothing about Photoshop and After Effects when I first came to the subreddit. I watched the videos


&gt;##6. is there anything I didn't bring up that you'd like to talk about? Whether about /r/makemeagif or anything else you'd like to talk about or plug here while you have the srotd audience?

&gt;&gt; **sprite144** If anybody has adobe photoshop and would like to learn how to make gifs

&gt;&gt; **matt01ss** We welcome any artists willing to take the time to help us make gifs. Many times our requests are simply to turn a small portion of a YouTube video into a gif
This is truly a humble subreddit
We welcome any subreddit to link to us on their sidebar if they would like to provide their users with some gif creation help!
Once again
Jesushx

Thanks guys! It's been a [blast!](http://i.minus.com/iX4hnx56OBmaL.gif) And thank you for making me all my strange gif requests!

For my write-up I wanted to find some research on the physiological and emotional aspects of cringing. Because cringing is a very social

Here are some things that they found about what makes something cringe inducing:

* The people go out of their way to embarrass themselves. i.e.: It's more than just an embarrassment

* They make a special effort. 

* They have pride in what they are doing. 

[One of the doctors that we talked to about cringes for this week's show pointed out that a cringe is basically the human body cowering in fear for an instant. And he said that one of the most fearsome, and not in a good way.](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/182/transcript)

But a really cool thing is that we also have the ability to put ourselves in other people's shoes and *cringe for them.* And that's where r/cringe comes in. Never in recorded history has there been so many people making that *extra effort* **and** filming it **and** uploading it to the web for all the world to see. Sometimes the videos can make you laugh

But take a look at r/cringe and cringe along with others

For if you cringe too, have empathy.

So anyhow

&gt;##1. How did r/cringe come about?

&gt;&gt; **ABsynth808** Interesting trivia fact about /r/cringe When I first started the sub over 3 years ago

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** /r/cringe was started by ABsynth808 3 years ago, I just sort of set it aside since I liked the name /r/cringe but I wasn't sure what to do from there. 4 months ago I decided to message AB and ask him if he'd hand over the keys to /r/cringe in hopes that I'd be able to do something with it. He agreed, and I spent the next few months slowly building it up to what I imagined it to be. I deleted all 3 posts that were on the page, and started with a clean slate and a total of 3 subscribers.

&gt;&gt;When I got the news that AB agreed to hand /r/cringe over

&gt;&gt;Since then it has mostly been a nice steady flow of subscribers, and plugged our subreddit. In one day we went from 3k subscribers to almost 7k. Since then, we've had a steady 200+ users on our subreddit and nearly 1k subs per day (give or take). (On the day we were plugged, we maxed out at 1700 online users at one time.) Things got a bit challenging after the huge surge of subscribers, but I think we've gotten things back on track after implementing new rules and new flair that will help users understand what's appropriate and what's not appropriate for our subreddit.

&gt;&gt;If anyone knows me from my other subreddits, but it's very rewarding.) I couldn't be more pleased with how /r/cringe has turned out. 



&gt;##2.Do you have any personal cringeworthy stories you would be willing to share?

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** There are too many little cringe-worthy stories for me to pick one. I remember just dancing in PE while playing foursquare with my Freshman year crush

&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz** A couple of weeks ago I was at a mattress store looking for a new bed. I had my eye on a nice looking Tempur-Pedic, and someone jumps on the other end to show that the vibrations won't shake the glass? John told me that if he jumped on the bed and the glass of wine tipped over, he would sell the bed to me at a 50% discount. If the wine glass remained in place, not only would I have to buy the bed, but I'd have to buy it at full price. You could tell he felt 100% certain that the glass wouldn't tip. I'm a sucker when it comes to bets, so I accepted. He pulled out a wine glass from below his desk (thinking back to this, it's pretty strange he keeps wine at hand) and filled a wine glass halfway full. He placed the filled wine glass at one corner of the bed and hoisted himself up on the other corner. As soon as he climbed up on the bed,000 dollar matress (which had no bedsheet covering it). Everyone in the store was staring. We exchanged quick awkward glances. Little did he know, cringing at how painfully embarrased John must be.

&gt;##3. Do you have any all-time favorite submissions?

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** There are a few that stuck with me

&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz** [This was posted a few days ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/10uyi6/girl_walks_off_stage_super_cringe_after_2_minutes/) It reminds me of my awkward middleschool and high school days when I had to do any sort of speech in front of multiple people. But this chick... this chick takes it to a whole new level. My balls literally curdle up like a turtle hides in it's shell when I watch public cringes like this.

&gt;##4.What would you like new visitors to r/cringe to know about your sub?


&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** **Read the sidebar.** I've removed 10+ submissions per day for not having a descriptive title alone. It's in the sidebar, so things will get hectic at times. Go through our past pages and check out the content that's been submitted over the past few months, there's some fantastic stuff back there. 

&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz**  **IF YOU DON'T READ THE SIDEBAR

&gt;##5. Would you like to say anything to your current subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** Hang in there. If they've been here from early on, and the sub seems to be back on track. I'd like to thank a handful of them who have been flagging posts and politely explaining the rules to users who might not understand what /r/cringe is about. We have a great community, and I think that's going to be a key to our subreddit's success. 

&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz** Your guy's submissions bring back painfull childhood memories.

&gt;##6. Do you have anything to add? Or anything you'd like to promote or plug?

&gt;&gt; **drumcowski** TELL YOUR FRIENDS! We're growing fast, but we could always use more! I don't really have anything to plug, though I have a few subreddits I'd like to get off the ground - they're just not at the right stage to plug any of them. I made /r/vgstreams for people who like to watch or stream live video games, though I didn't do much with it yet. If anyone's interested in doing something with it feel free to message me. I'm also always looking for popular subreddits to help moderate!

&gt;&gt;On an unrelated note

&gt;&gt; **lilstumpz** Yes! I created two fairly popular subs called /r/MorbidReality and /r/NSFWFunny. Check them out


Thanks guys! You're all the way beautiful!

**Are American Teachers Asking Too Much from their Students?**

Last week

""Since standardized testing began, we've tried every possible scenario.  Clearly the problem isn't the teachers, it's the kids!""  Ms. McBrearty continued. ""(The teachers) have all the tests from previous years, we spend the entire year teaching to the darn state test and still the kids don't get it!  If you stop blaming teachers for one second and put the blame where it belongs, on the kids, it starts to make a whole lot of sense, am I right?  I mean, when really

According to th nation's 2012's test results

Upon hearing this year's scores

""You want better test scores?  Well, U.S. Secretary of Education and keynote speaker at this summer's conference.  ""You could try harder, and we've done that.  I think it's time for Plan B.  Let's lower the Language Arts and Math to the level where the student's are functioning and see how it plays out.  I'm confident that next year... China can suck it.""

While many teachers were immediately enthusiastic about this prospect

Juan Maria Jimenez, but the principal told me that some funds were available and they were hiring new teachers to pull out those kids who were doing good.  These teachers are gonna work with kids like my daughter, kids who can read and multiply, and they're gonna  slow 'em down a bit so they can relate to the other kids.  Mr. Jimenez concluded by saying, ""I'm glad someone's looking out for my daughter.""

No Child out in Front had many interesting presenters and exhibitors at what may become an annual event and country wide initiative.  Attendees had opportunities to meet the Insane Clown Posse's Violent Jay and Shaggy Too Dope, Larry the Cable Guy and most of Rascal Flatts.

Here to discuss /r/nottheonion is one of my favourite moderators

&gt;The posts at /r/nottheonion are incredible. What differentiates you and WTF?

&gt;&gt;Aren't they? I feel so lucky that so many people are contributing so many great posts.
As far as r/WTF: I also think there's a little bit of crossover with r/offbeat
best level. I should explain.

&gt;&gt;The concept for r/nottheonion is to find stories that read exactly like an Onion article
not The Onion. Those are pretty rare
it's also okay for the second level or class of posts - things that sound like they're something the
Onion would write about
that point.

&gt;&gt;The third level is stories that probably should be posted in r/offbeat or r/wtf - but I don't like
removing posts
pretty subjective judgment if I start removing stuff. Why this and not that? Well... it was my mood and
how it struck me. So better to try and let the community decide. More on this in a second
relevant to the next question

&gt;I notice in your rules and guidelines
create this rule?

&gt;&gt;Politics nowadays are more divisive than ever. As a liberal Democrat
Republicans do to be r/nottheonion-worthy; but that's partly because of my personal perspective. I
don't want r/nottheonion to be a liberal outpost - I want everyone to be able to participate.
As the subreddit's subscriber count started to explode
seemed not so much to fit the subreddit
to keep things neutral. Most of us can agree that those crazy cat ladies are crazy; not everyone agrees
that one party or the other is crazy. :)

&gt;&gt;So not much of a story - I just want to keep the subreddit as open as possible
not at all outlawing) political posts -- to try and get people to think before submitting - is all I
want.

&gt;What types of posts get the best reaction? Do you have a favourite type of submission?

&gt;&gt;It's really interesting to me what gets traction and what doesn't. I really think it depends on finding
a good article; not how much it feels like an Onion article (because those are rare). I think most
readers/voters are seeing things on their front page
sense
removing posts that really don't fit - but I think the community we have now is friendly and happy
I'm refraining. I do remove things that just really seem inappropriate

&gt;&gt;My favorite type of submission is absolutely articles that read like they're from The Onion. It's the
purpose of the subreddit

&gt;Do you notice any trends in the subreddit? If so
about the state of humanity?

&gt;&gt;I have been pleased that political posts have not overrun
election in the US. I think we really have a friendly community growing - though I have had to remove
some angry posts (bad language / threats / trolling). But very

&gt;Last paragraph is yours. Anything you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;Late last year
it did
for control
crossposted articles there
and got it up to 500+ subs (IIRC).

&gt;&gt;Then
exploded - got up to 2000+ quickly
I'm proud of the community that's sprung up. I think things are going very well!",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/xdhwq/july_30_2012_rnottheonion_are_american_teachers/

[1. they are cheap!  
2. they are tasty!  
3. they are easy to make!](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/219736/thumbs/s-JIM-CARREY-large.jpg)

In our college the 2-min noodles is an all time favourite! But

There's a false conception that cheap meals are fast food! Its waaay more. Cheap meals can be amazingly healthy too. This [top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/q5rnn/the_435_method_or_how_to_eat_like_a_college/) of the sub will definitely put your thoughts to rest. i guarantee you!

Cheap food is awesome and it attracts people from all over the world! maybe rich or not-so-rich! the reason its so popular is because of the easiness in making and its taste! Let it be a college student, a singer, a scientist, a employee after a hard day of work cursing his boss, a boss after a hard day of work cursing his employees! :D or anyone for that matter, everyone loves cheap meals!

So i sat down with the head mod

&gt;##1. What was your inspiration for creating/moderating this sub ? 
&gt;&gt;**Willravel:** I didn't create the subreddit, and lawnmowerkitten asked if I'd like to moderate. My inspiration for becoming a moderator was my own personal history with eating cheap.  
Once upon a time I was a poor college student like many Redditors and found that eating cheap meals was an absolute necessity, so I came up with this meal planning method aimed at maintaining a stable but incredibly cheap diet. After college and getting a few careers, the meal planning just sort of stuck. When I was asked to moderate, I thought this would be a community I had something in common with, so I jumped at the chance. 

&gt;##2. What's your favourite cheap meal and how often do you have cheap meals?
&gt;&gt;**Willravel:** This is a tough one. One of the staples of /r/Cheap_Meals is rice and beans, I like the way Latin American cultures make them, with a bit of heat. You can add salsa to rice and beans and serve them in homemade tortillas, for example, and the meals is delicious, filling, nutritious

&gt;##3. Whats the cheapest meal you have ever tasted and how was it ? :P
&gt;&gt;**Willravel:** I've never been paid to eat food, skilled work, and for the most part I had a pretty great time. One of the projects I was put in charge of was of a retired couple that absolutely adored growing food. Their back yard garden was twice the size of my back yard and had basically every type of food that could grow in my climate. The first day working there, the couple mentioned that my crew and I were welcome to eat the food from the garden.  
We. Ate. Like. Kings. Being the generous guy I am, more delicious than anything I ever made from store-bought produce mostly because shipped produce has to be picked early, is sprayed with garbage, and is often modified for general use. At the end of the project, I made everyone, including the retired couple, a huge meal to thank them for their generosity.  
Growing food requires an initial investment, you can get a substantial return on your investment. 

&gt;##4. Do you have anything to say to your readers and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Willravel:** /r/Cheap_Meals has developed into a great community of people all organized around the idea that food doesn't have to be expensive to be outstanding. I've been really fortunate that the community has, but otherwise I just like being like any other subscriber to the subreddit.  
I hope people will come by and check out our subreddit.  
Meal cheaply

If you're MURICAN and you don't subscribe to this subreddit

So when this subreddit was 'nominated'

That's when all hell broke loose. Hippie, go for it."" But LG and Jax? Oh no. They were not going to sit idly by while I question to act of being patriotic.

LG was all like ""MiraP

And then Jax was ""I thought this was Murica

U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!

MIRAP! MIRAP! MIRAP!""

I had enough. I was sleepy, after freshening up and rereading what I wrote, I just felt [like this](http://i.imgur.com/ojTzf.jpg).

Who was I anymore? Did I really lose my love for McDonalds

Hell No!

Then I replied with ""You call yourselves Muricans!? Tell me this, *and* blue? If you just bleed red, you're a commie.
I
One time, you tell me!"" and [showed off my nails](http://i.imgur.com/oxFgh.jpg).
Are you guys saying I'm not Murican enough??""

That put an end to the discussion.

Ok so about the nails thing. 

1.  It's a true story.

2.  I did my nails like that for the Olympics. TEAM USA!!!

3.  I'm really *really* happy TSA had a sense of humor and didn't pat me down.

So why feature /r/MURICA


&gt;##1. How American would you say you are?

&gt;&gt;**blinkerfluid13**I piss freedom.

&gt;&gt;**CommandADelete**So

&gt;&gt;**MrsDrZoidberg**I'm so Murican I can't even name another country (Canadia don't count) FREEDOM.

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa**Last year I found myself in Paris on the 4th of July. My group of friends (all proud 'Muricans) decided it was our civic duty to spread freedom. So I got a jean jacket

&gt;&gt;**RiceIsBliss**I drink ketchup

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy**Life motto: ""Intercourse monetary bills; receive women""

&gt;&gt;**hapahaole_**FREEEEBIIIIIIIRD!!!!!!!!

&gt;&gt;**mattc286**On a scale of Steve Jobs to Martin Luther King

&gt;##2.  How do you react when someone trash talks America?

&gt;&gt;**blinkerfluid13**I punch them in the face and deport them back to Canada.

&gt;&gt;**CommandADelete**I can't usually hear them over my freedom.

&gt;&gt;**MrsDrZoidberg** Well

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa**I smile quietly to myself

&gt;&gt;**RiceIsBliss**People don't trash talk America

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy**I feel bad for them because they can't recognize true freedom.

&gt;&gt;**hapahaole_**FRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEBIIIIIIRDDD!!!!!!

&gt;&gt;**mattc286**Exercise my 2nd Amendment Rights on their ass.

&gt;##3. Red

&gt;&gt;**blinkerfluid13**MURICA! Fuck yeah!

&gt;&gt;**CommandADelete**Pleading the fifth because thats racist

&gt;&gt;**MrsDrZoidberg**These veins bleed red

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa**Like a true 'Murican I CHOOSE THEM ALL! THIS IS 'MURICA AND MY CHOICE IS ALWAYS ""ALL OF THE ABOVE!""

&gt;&gt;**RiceIsBliss** All three

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy**You can't tell a 'Murican to pick only one of the 3 colors.

&gt;&gt;**hapahaole_**FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBIIIIIIIIIIIRD!!!

&gt;&gt;**mattc286**Red is for Commies. Blue is the color of pansies, none of the colors alone are very good. No, just like chocolate and vanilla soft serve, only the SWIRLY COMBINATION OF GOODNESS of all three colors can create a true symbol of FREEDOM.

&gt;##4. What's the most patriotic thing you've ever done?

&gt;&gt;**blinkerfluid13**I took my eagle out to the Olympics so that I could sing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" while drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon: The official beer of NASCAR.

&gt;&gt;**CommandADelete**Got drunk and did the dougie on stage in Lagos wearing only an American flag

&gt;&gt;**MrsDrZoidberg**I rescued a baby bald eagle and mouth fed that sucker til he done got nursed back to health. Then when he was full grown I done flew on that sonuvabitch all around Washin'ton

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa**During the Olympic opening ceremonies I got a bar full of people to sing over ""God Save the Queen"" with the lyrics of ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"". That night George Washington came to me in a dream and gave me a thumbs up.

&gt;&gt;**RiceIsBliss**I caught a wild bald eagle with just my bare hands and an American flag. But then I released it because freedom.

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy**Went back in time and killed Osama with my bear(literally bears) hands.

&gt;&gt;**hapahaole_**FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFREEBIRD!

&gt;&gt;**mattc286**I once shot an empty can of Budwiser off the roof of a rusted out Ford pick up next to an abandoned quarry and then drank a swig of bourbon. Did I mention that it was also the Fourth of July and that I was wearing nothing but an American Flag Speedo?

&gt;##5. How is it that are non-Muricans on your mod team?

&gt;&gt;**blinkerfluid13**Here in Murica we believe that even Strayans can learn how to be patriots.

&gt;&gt;**CommandADelete**I offered nudes

&gt;&gt;**MrsDrZoidberg**Communists IN MY SUBREDDIT??? I don't think so. FREEDOM FOR ALL.

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa**Strength through diversity. I WANT THE STRONGEST MURICA POSSIBLE!

&gt;&gt;**RiceIsBliss**Everyone's Murican that wants to be Murican

&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy**I don't believe in non-'Muricans: Only people who haven't experienced true freedom.

&gt;&gt;**hapahaole_**freebird?

&gt;What type of pictures is Patrick usually in?

**12

So, and the payout has been awesome. I've been playing it since I could get my hands on it, and have pried myself from it for this short time to feature its unofficial subreddit, /r/CubeWorld. I promise you this will be a good feature.

I try my best to put the best of a place in good light, and let you decide for yourself. Let's start with the most important thing in a subreddit: the content. I would compare /r/CubeWorld's content to /r/Gaming. By that I mean: Buckle up, you're about to get a blast of jokes, screenshots, and the rare awesome post. Like Frankie said, they do things their way, and I won't fault them for it. Still with me? Okay. Here comes my main disagreement with /r/CubeWorld: The community *is* /r/Gaming. I want you to reflect on that

Now for the good parts. /r/CubeWorld is *the* place for information on the game, to pet rumors to item IDs are here for your perusing. The daily supply of Cube World information is pretty good, even compared to other places dedicated to the game.

Since this is a subreddit about a game, you should play this game with them. If you don't have friends, you should try finding some. For Cube World, I recommend [CWLFG](http://www.cwlfg.com/).

But enough about me and my shilling

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**Maebbie** I am Maebbie and created /r/CubeWorld. Back then I wanted to help to kick-start the Community by using reddit as a place to share information

&gt;&gt;**Zamsax** I am Zamsax

&gt;&gt;**JPEGz** Noticeable jump in the amount of mod mail we're receiving

&gt;&gt;**Tom_Luthor** I must be Canadian (I wish), which im planning on releasing on my awesome subreddit that I use for testing CSS and junk /r/truedatman (Not sure if im allowed to put that there...sorry)

&gt;#2. Being in alpha

&gt;&gt;**Maebbie** To be honest, The elder Scrolls games or Minecraft it will be a great experience. The skill system is still in development, but the skills available are intuitive. The randomly generated terrains are providing a great ""replayability"" or many hours of exploring on one character.

&gt;&gt;**Zamsax** If you haven't waited for a long time and don't fully know what the game is about

&gt;&gt;**Tom_Luthor** Do it

&gt;#3. Since the game is so new

&gt;&gt;**Maebbie** Beware the Raccoon, due to many strong enemies. The best way to play it is to run where you like to go. I also recommend to save 6 skill points (you receive 2 each level at the beginning) and 10 silver. After that you put 5 points in climbing or swimming in order to unlock the ability to use a hang-glider or a boat. For 10 silver you can then buy one of those 2 at any town. If you are lost with the controls, you can press F1 for a keymap.

&gt;&gt;**Zamsax** If you have other friends playing Cube World, share your loot fairly or else it could worsen the experience. If you see crossed swords on the map, that means that it is a quest. If you go there you will much likely stumble upon a dungeon or a boss. Complete the quest and you will receive a lot of experience and some very nice loot.

&gt;#4. What has it been like moderating the CubeWorld subreddit

&gt;&gt;**Maebbie** Since around 1 Month ago it had been pretty relaxed. It came to a point where we got messages that there are too many Moderators. Most of the Team has been Moderator in here for over 1 year and I am happy that they are still all active in order to help moderating. Even though the Subreddit is relatively small there are 1000 Member online at times since the game released. It is kind of a mess

&gt;&gt;**Zamsax** At some points it has been quite frustrating

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch. Anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;**Maebbie** I like to keep /r/CubeWorld an open and neutral place for any kind of Discussion. As long as it is Cube World related I don't mind. Our sidebar has a list of international and language-specific Community sites. There are also a few Subreddits listed

&gt;&gt;**Zamsax** If you are playing Cube World

Thank you

*For the sake of awesomeness, and she did this write-up.  Enjoy.*

Okay, but if you’d shut up for five seconds, Kristen, I’d tell you why.  It’s like so-oh many other “explain like” subreddits, with a fun little twist – every reply is answered in character as Dr. Cox.  Why, yes, that *is* special

Well, “What kind of questions can I ask?”  It’s not rocket science – you can ask anything.  Now, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikedrcox/comments/1bi2i6/elidc_why_does_a_12_year_old_100_pound_kid_and_a/) question is the one that inspired the subreddit, when it was asked in /r/explainlikeimfive.  Since then, people have asked for all kinds of things to be explained by Dr. Cox, such as [the karma system of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikedrcox/comments/1eui6v/eldc_the_karma_system_of_reddit/).  Do you need more examples there, Ashley?  Okay.  [Why are people so enamored with the MMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikedrcox/comments/1ck3mg/eldc_why_people_are_so_enamored_with_mma/)?  [Why don’t girls smile when I smile at them](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikedrcox/comments/1brbek/eldc_why_dont_girls_smile_when_i_smile_at_them/)?  And, I’m a little biased on this one

And I could sit here and explain this all day

&gt;#1. Why did you want to be a part of this subreddit’s moderation team?

&gt;&gt;**GCS_3** I created the Sub after NickMcAwesome posed the initial request

&gt;&gt;**noreaster2011** I’m friends with one of the other mods

&gt;&gt;**NickMcAwesome** I’m a huge fan of Scrubs and the Explain like network

&gt;#2. Do you have a favorite ELDC?

&gt;&gt;**GCS_3** [This one

&gt;&gt;**noreaster2011** Personally

&gt;&gt;**NickMcAwesome** I’d also have to go with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikedrcox/comments/1d3nux/eldc_why_does_drinking_appletinis_make_me_pee_so/) one; it’s a good question with an informing answer.

&gt;#3. What is your favorite episode of Scrubs?

&gt;&gt;**GCS_3** This is cheating a bit

&gt;&gt;**noreaster2011**  I have 2 favorites.  One is the episode where Dr. Cox vents about his day to his son in fairy tale form. It was just an incredibly creative way to tell the story
&gt;&gt;Two, they ended it perfectly. Again, that load of crap that came after doesn't exist in my mind.

&gt;&gt;**NickMcAwesome** The real final episode is hard to beat; everything about it was perfect.

&gt;#4. What’s your favorite name that Dr. Cox has ever called JD?

&gt;&gt;**GCS_3** Newbie

&gt;&gt;**noreaster2011** Newbie.  Maybe it has sentimental value

&gt;&gt;**NickMcAwesome** Gotta go with “Lassie” in season 2 ep. 18 “My T.C.W.” after the whole kidding Rowdy thing.

&gt;#5. ELDC: Why is your subreddit so awesome?

&gt;&gt;**GCS_3**  I think where we shine is the amount of user creativity in this sub; all the content is from the user. Not only do you have to create a great answer but also you have to ask the right questions.

&gt;&gt;**noreaster2011** Listen Sally, then God help us all. I'd say go ask your boyfriend Ghandi... but inevitably that leads back to me. You see, there is no one else as BRILLIANT as we are. Now if you'll excuse me, Kelso just headed off after his third cup of coffee, and I really need to give old Bob-o a good shock. Run along, Julie, run along.

&gt;&gt;**NickMcAwesome** We sprung from pure impulse into a great community full of kind

&gt;#6. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**GCS_3** Newbie! It turns out I, make sure you kick off your pumps so you don’t snap one of those chicken ankles of yours.

&gt;&gt;**noreaster2011** Thanks for picking us.  We had some good momentum early on

&gt;&gt;**NickMcAwesome** Thanks for the opportunity!  It’s just a kick in the keester we need to develop into a thriving subreddit!

The signs of the apocalypse have been around for awhile.  Birds dropped dead from the sky two years in a row, and the ultimate apocalypse food, the Twinkie, went extinct.  That’s real end of times stuff.

So, according to some people who think they interpreted a Mayan calendar, we at SROTD only thought it was fair that everyone be prepared for end of times.

Of course, though!

/r/Apocalypse is dedicated to the end of days.  Of course, zombie apocalypse…

Fair warning: Do not be in my group for the zombie apocalypse.  You know the reality show Survivor?  Well, but rather, they get to live.

Anyway, to discuss the end of the world as we know it.

&gt;#1. What inspired you to take on this particular role in the end of the world – subreddit mod?

&gt;&gt;**syuk** I was asked to help a while ago, and of course other more contemporary threats that are crystallising.

&gt;#2. What do you expect from the community?

&gt;&gt;**syuk** the sub serves as a place for folk who are interested in reading and sharing articles to discuss end-time scenarios and other esoteric news and ideas.

&gt;&gt;Apocalypse can refer to many catastrophic events, the environment, secret societies and knowledge - basically any topics that touch on the actual 'ending' of times occurring by almost any means.

&gt;&gt;It is good to see people contributing discussion and expertise across so many different subjects really.

&gt;#3. I’m sure you know this

&gt;&gt;**syuk** I guess I'd try and get my family and myself away from the inner city in case whatever happens does not result in the total annihilation of the planet

&gt;#4. What is your favorite apocalypse/end of the world movie?

&gt;&gt;**syuk** Difficult really to pick one from all the possible genres and potential threats - from Zombies

&gt;#5. Okay

&gt;&gt;**syuk** Skill-up

&gt;#6. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**syuk** Apocalypse is a wide topic area because of the many different scenarios people think could happen. Many posts are light hearted and tongue-in-cheek

Thank you so much, precious time.  The rest of you should get prepared because the end is near.  Or it isn’t, I don’t know.  I’m a Redditor, not a prophet.  Either way, I’m prepared for either end of times or an earthquake, so I’m good.",,self,WRITER,

I consider myself fortunate. Although I have never won the lottery or escaped a near death experience, overheated, the keys would snap in half, they are so light that if there was even a tiny bit of water on the pavement they would hydroplane like the [Cobra Moray,](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3568/3490053112_0a397c8054.jpg) I would still invest time and effort trying to make it the [best example of German engineering on the block.](http://i.imgur.com/fzcig.jpg) 

Then my wife decided to buy [a Subaru.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/'93-'01_Subaru_Impreza_Wagon.jpg)

My first experience driving this car was in the mountains in California. It was slow and it felt like a tank. I had never ridden in a car that felt more connected to the ground. Intrigued

Subaru culture is very interesting. The marque is respected and very involved in many areas of motorsport

/r/subaru came on the scene a little over two years ago,](http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/xy3cb/parked_my_car_to_go_to_class_and_came_back_to_see/) testaments to the [design and build quality of these cars](http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/12ijm7/subaru_engineering_saved_my_life/) and hilarious looks at the [daily life of a subaru driver](http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/11gyzt/i_laughed_but_around_here_its_very_true/)

To get a handle on the people driving this subreddit

&gt; What is your background in Subaru culture?

&gt;&gt;**TheBossIsWatching:** Many moons ago I worked as a mechanics apprentice for a few years in a Subaru dealership and simply fell in love with boxer engines. I've owned a few in my time and I'm heavily involved in a rally team where the main car is an Impreza.

&gt;&gt;**tmeckenstock:** I started becoming interested in Subarus back when I first started searching for a car. I ended up with a Ford Ranger.... I got a little older/more responsible/gained monies and then could finally afford my baby.

&gt;&gt;**Uppy:** I've been exclusively driving Subaru's since I learnt to drive and have loved them ever since. I am a member of another subaru forum since 09 and have attended national meets involving track racing and am the holder of the fastest and slowest driver around the khanacross track.

&gt; What are you driving right now?

&gt;&gt;**TheBossIsWatching:** A Ford Cortina Mk3 GT &amp; a Vauxhall Vectra 2.2 SRi. I punish myself daily for not currently owning a Subaru but I've owned a few in my time and wanted a change. Got my eyes on a stunning Legacy though so I won't remain a traitor for long. Could be worse

&gt;&gt;**tmeckenstock:** 2004 Subaru Forester XT

&gt;&gt;**Uppy:** Nothing at this moment my car was recently stolen and burnt out. Finding another one to replace it has been tough.

&gt; What is your favourite Subaru model?

&gt;&gt;**TheBossIsWatching:** Impreza P1. I have an unhealthy obsession with that car. The Cosworth Impreza is a very close second.

&gt;&gt;**tmeckenstock:** I have a bias here in that the Forester XT (04-08)'s are my favorite. they have the sti block and are basically jacked up versions of the car. As a result

&gt;&gt;**Uppy:** MY03 Subaru Impreza STi in Black. Accepting donations ;)

&gt; What is your favorite /r/subaru submission?

&gt;&gt;**TheBossIsWatching:** Going to have to give the Photo of the Month competition a shameless plug here. We get some amazing entries every month and there are some simply stunning cars that show up in that thread. In second place is definitely [this submission](http://i.imgur.com/QtqjX.jpg) purely because it's an awesome car and breaks from the usual Impreza/Legacy pics we get. [3rd place is this beast.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcyimjMAJV1rpq8f3o1_1280.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**tmeckenstock:** I'm particularly partial to seeing any form of the older Subaru posts. I love seeing the classic rally subaru or even someones old Subaru Brat that they've driven since god knows how long.

&gt;&gt;**Uppy:** The subaru drawsomething post. Having played the game major props to getting in that much detail http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/rikhn/best_drawsomething_ever/

&gt; Whats the craziest situation AWD ever got you out of?

&gt;&gt;**TheBossIsWatching:** Hit black ice in the first ever Impreza I owned and the car went into a serious slide at about 50MPH. My wife was in the passenger seat and it was a combination of the AWD

&gt;&gt;**tmeckenstock:** I mean... I drove onto a construction site one time and you know how they have those bigs hills of dirt from where they've been excavating? I figured I'd better drive over it to prove my AWD dominance of that hill. Very steep. But she pull right through the loose gravel and champed over the top. This was especially scary because it was midnight and I couldn't see over the top of the hill until I was over it....

&gt;&gt;**Uppy:** A mates Cressy spun a bearing on the highway awhile ago and his friends Ute came to tow it. On the last leg of the journey up an enormous hill the ute failed to get traction and a Leone came to save the day with its AWD.

&gt; Any words for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**TheBossIsWatching:** We've gone from 500 subscribers to close to 6, fantastically friendly and mature. It's hands down my favourite subreddit purely because of the fantastic individuals that frequent it so to all our members: Thank you.

&gt;&gt;**tmeckenstock:** I restarted this subreddit last summer and it's so wonderful to see so much growth and general optimistic enthusiasm for the world of Subarus. I could not have done it one my own. Boss and Uppy saved my ass in soooo many many ways too

&gt;&gt;**Uppy:** Awesome members and keep up the great quality. Less meme macros and more up voting on posts would be great to see. I notice a lot of people comment in posts but the post itself sits on 3 or 4 up votes making it hard to gain exposure.

I remember wanting to be a scientist as a kid. I don't know how many 6 year olds ask for a microscope for their birthday.

It seemed like a relatively simple job to me- you just stand at a counter, all the better!

Unfortunately, but my first and last foray left me without bleach, ammonia, a proper short term memory, and a proper short term memory. 

But worry not

/r/ChemicalReactionGifs collects and catalogues the coolest chemical combinations.  If it foams, it'll be here! No more singed fingers or temporary blindness, now that I can get my science fill in gif/video form. 

The creator of r/CRG, no such thing exists to my knowledge. But we *can* feature this venerable academic's project- interview below!

&gt;What inspired you to create /r/ChemicalReactionGifs?

&gt;&gt;There was a front page post of a reaction involving chlorine and sodium making table salt, and being a chemistry major myself, I thought it'd be a fun thing to do. Chemical reactions can often be very beautiful or extremely explosive, so that's a plus!

&gt;Your subreddit has been around for only a few days

&gt;&gt;Mainly through that front page comment mentioned about advertising it. That happened a few days though, so who's to say nobody else has!

&gt;What's the most memorable lab demonstration you ever did in science class?

&gt;&gt;I've never actually done my favorite experiment

&gt;What scientific discovery/breakthrough would you like to see in your own lifetime?

&gt;#1. What inspired this subreddit and/or what made you want to be a part of it?

&gt;&gt;**stumblinghunter** [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/19eqwk/dude_i_smoked_like_10_bowls_and_didnt_even_get/) is the post that originated this subreddit.  JBurto was the one who originally made the subreddit.  I can’t speak for the other mods

&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme** Someone told me it existed and I paid a visit.  I was immediately taken.  I fucking love tiny things

&gt;&gt;**cole2493** I was in /r/trees and saw the original post that inspired this subreddit and asked to be mod.

&gt;#2. Do you have a favorite submission

&gt;&gt;**stumblinghunter** My favorite types would be the ones that are a play on words, a hill for ants?” when it really is an anthill.  It’s kind of stupid when I think about it, but with the extreme majority of posts titled “What is this, a ___ for ants?” I usually just expect a tiny version of a typical object so I’m delightfully caught off guard.

&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme** My favorite type of submissions is an object that is comically undersized

&gt;&gt;**cole2493** I really like the animal related ones where it is a tiny animal but my al time favorite post is probably [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/thingsforants/comments/1d7el5/what_is_this_a_human_for_ants/).

&gt;#3. Have you ever actually seen *Zoolander*?

&gt;&gt;**stumblinghunter** Multiple times.

&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme** Um YES!  Twice.  I acquired an HD copy just recently when I was updating the header.

&gt;&gt;**cole2493** I’ve seen it several times and love it.

&gt;#4. What is your favorite part in *Zoolander* that isn’t the center for ants part?

&gt;&gt;**stumblinghunter** I still catch myself saying “Why don’t you dere-licte my balls” every once in awhile, and trying to access the computer towards the end still cracks me up.

&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme** Probably when Derek and Hansel are trying to figure out how to use the computer.  Oh and the gas fight.  That’s everyone’s favorite part.

&gt;&gt;**cole2493** My favorite part is probably his “different” faces that are really just all the same

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**stumblinghunter** Would you like some headshots for when you put us in your magazine?

&gt;&gt;**stopscopiesme** I’ve been seeing a lot of literalism in /r/thingsforants.  Like, guys, be sure to check out the new queue!  Sometimes things get downvoted for no reason and never see the front page.

&gt;&gt;**cole2493** I just want to add that my favorite part of this subreddit is that anytime a picture of something small is posted somewhere

Thank you, check out /r/thingsforants and be amazed at how tiny things can be.  Or at least go watch *Zoolander* and catch up on some pop culture.",,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,WRITER,

Okay, and being from Lower New Zanada, Soupy was all over that.  But I didn’t know that he was going to feature it so fast!  Those New Zanadians do not waste time, and my North Ameristralian occasional laziness did not serve me well.

I let you down

/r/Ameristralia is the awesome union of America and Australia being one nation

Our national animal is the Eagoala.  It’s fierce and adorable and a symbol of freedom.  Our flag is [beautiful](http://i.imgur.com/6dJgOZ9.png).  Our national sport of [Austus](http://www.aolnews.com/2006/12/07/football-history-101-the-lost-hybrid-game/) actually existed before we became a great nation

And New Zanadians think they have freedom, I would if Macca D’s sponsored my kid or something, but you know… save a few hundred thousand dollars, I’m leaning towards Victoria or Richard.  Either way, that’s freedom.

I sat down with the mods of /r/Ameristralia to discuss how awesome freedom is and why we’re better at it than New Zanada.

&gt;#1. I know that Ameristralia is a great country

&gt;&gt;**Musicmatobes** I wanted to be a mod because I loved the idea and I thought I could help manage something amazing.

&gt;&gt;**lefoss** I got a spot as a mod because I made the post that started the name and am learning about being a mod from this sub.

&gt;#2. New Zanada often likes to claim they have more freedom than us.  What is your response to these allegations?

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes** These allegations are fueled by mere jealousy.  Kiwis are cool and maple syrup is great

&gt;&gt;**lefoss** Lies.  Lies and slander.  They are good neighbors

&gt;#3. I feel like this merger between nations has brought out the best of the North and South Ameristralians.  We just seem happier than we used to be.  Would you agree with this sentiment

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes** I do agree 100%.  This whole project has really brought people together

&gt;&gt;**lefoss** I think that many north and south matriots didn’t realize how much they have in common until or nation was brought together.

&gt;#4. What do you think is the best thing to come out of Ameristralia so far?

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes** The best thing to come out of Ameristralia is bringing people together.  All of the positive energy coming out of this really gets people happy and excited.  I love that.  I loved all of the drawings and the photoshops and the flag ideas too.  The fact that people spend time doing things like this for our nation just gives me a warm fuzzy feeling of freedom and patriotism in my heart.

&gt;&gt;**lefoss** I think the collaborative way that the crest, etc. were designed and tweaked by our citizens is pretty cool.

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes** I’d like to add a thanks to the whole /r/Ameristralia community for your ideas and your input

&gt;&gt;**lefoss** After gaining such a huge following so quickly

Knitting, sweaters, socks, and even underwear can be made from the process of knitting, among anything else one might create. Though I cannot knit (stupid hands), I respect the ability to create things, and so I chose this subreddit to feature on this

""Xavier, my imaginary questioner, the reason is simple. I'm in Florida, where it is warm. I used to live in Pennsylvania, where it is cold. Back then, my grandmother would knit me things to wear in the winter. A sweater is all that survives today. I got to thinking about it, and now my mind is consumed with knitting. So

I was a bit surprised to find /r/knitting, based on the first page, they're all young!). I was disappointed, fascinated, and a bit curious. Mostly if they took requests. I'd give my sixth arm for some nice socks. In order to ask questions, though not that one, I contacted the moderators. Their answers have taken refuge below.

&gt;#1. Firstly

&gt;&gt;**CupcakeOctopus** With knitting you use two pointy sticks and string to create awesome stuff

&gt;&gt;**Japaneseknotweed** You know how the song says ""You can't always get what you want""? You know how, the exact texture you like most, sleeves that end right where your arms do. And if you make a mistake, you can rip it back and nobody ever knows it was there. It's attainable perfection that you create yourself. And also, if you're the ADHD type, it gives you something to do with your hands in committee meetings.

&gt;#2. Knitting produces cool stuff

&gt;&gt;**CupcakeOctopus** Different people find different things difficult. Some people struggle just to get started, some people struggle to make fiddly little stuffed toys. It really varies.

&gt;&gt;**Japaneseknotweed** Getting past the idea that it's hard. Knitting is how the average peasant kept his feet warm for centuries, your ability to feed yourself, head on over to /r/cooking and get out from under the ready-made food industry. Knitting, or creating anything that protects or sustains us, is part of that same birthright. As soon as you stop seeing knitting as a mystical talent, the rest is just looking at what you're doing and truly seeing how it works. Knit stitches are just pixels, patterns are just algorithms. If you can code you can knit.

&gt;#3. Because I'm curious of what can be done with it: What do you think the coolest thing you've ever seen knitted was?

&gt;&gt;**CupcakeOctopus** Most of the coolest knitted things I've seen have actually shown up in /r/pics. That full knitted suit

&gt;&gt;**Japaneseknotweed**  Hmm. Dave Cole's [flag](http://davecoledavecole.com/projects-knitting-machine.php) is good if you like high-concept art. There's a lot of geek knitting out there too -- uteruses, I love Latvian mittens. In traditional society, brides knitted a pair for every member of the groom's family -- including the pig.

&gt;#4. Alright

&gt;&gt;**CupcakeOctopus** Nay. Way too hot.

&gt;&gt;**Japaneseknotweed** Well, just much smaller. But you were probably thinking of something more like these [willie warmers](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/search#view=cards&amp;pattern-link=willy-warmer-by-nsfwdesigns&amp;sort=favorites), weren't you?

&gt;#5. Thanks for taking time out of your lives to answer my silly questions

&gt;&gt;**CupcakeOctopus** We're a very welcoming community with a lot to offer. There are lots of men and women that knit, then dive in - even if you don't know how to knit, we have resources in our wiki to help you get started.

&gt;&gt;**Japaneseknotweed** Wool is hair. If someone knits you a sweater that's a little scratchy

And there you have it, signing off.

Bold statement time.      
     
**I think South Park is the greatest cartoon television series of all time.**    
      
South Park has been airing for 16 seasons since 1997, and crude. One week we can have a very honest look at a serious topic, the next week, we watch an asian man shit into Kyle's mouth. It's a balancing act, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone have perfected it. No one can do what they do. They are gods.    
      
     
Ever since the show aired my parents loathed that show entirely. I remember being seven-years-old, even at an early age.      
      
I remember when the movie was released. My mother blatantly refused to let me go see it. We had a long drawn out fight about it, and demanded she let me rent the movie. Bigger, Longer, and Uncut warped me. Not in a good way, not in a bad way, but it definitely affected me, and shaped me into the personI am today.      
     
I remember yesterday
       
My parents tried so hard to shield me from Matt and Trey's sleepy little Colorado town
     
Kudos to them for trying though. 


&gt;##1. What should people expect to find on your subreddit?   
     
&gt;&gt;**roger_**: Pretty much anything related to the show -- clips, memes, etc.
There's usually a fairly active discussion thread every Wednesday when there's a new episode airing
    

&gt;##2.  Favorite South Park episode?

&gt;&gt;**roger_**: Tough one. I like the early episodes where the town would get demolished and all sorts of crazy stuff would happen -- Mecha-Streisand is probably the best example of that.  

&gt;&gt;**SativaSteve**: Medicinal fried Chicken

   
&gt;##3. Favorite Cartman moment?


&gt;&gt;**roger_**: Damn
Or maybe when he fed Scott Tenorman his parents (Scott Tenorman Must Die)!
   
&gt;&gt;**SativaSteve**: Being an 'ex-ginger' myself



&gt;##4. What do you prefer: the older South Park with more poop jokes and killing Kenny

&gt;&gt;**roger_**:The older one
I think they had a fair bit of social commentary too (epitomized by Stan's ""you know I learned something today"" monologues at the end)
    
&gt;&gt;**Swedeniscold**: I liked the older South Park when I was younger, and figured I would give it another chance. Was blown away by the current events satire and the overall growth of the show.


&gt;##5. Where do you see South Park in five years? Still making episodes? Will Trey and Matt move on to different things?

&gt;&gt;**roger_**:  Well the show's contracted to run another four years
I'm not sure if Matt and Trey would be willing to commit to more seasons though
    
&gt;&gt;**Swedeniscold**: I really have no idea. When I look at the past few seasons, but also some 'meh' experiences. I was kind of disappointed that they chose to not follow through on the big changes that were set out in the double header 'You're Getting Old' and 'Assburgers' last year - that could have really vitalized the show again.

&gt;##6. Favorite South Park character?


&gt;&gt;**roger_**: Probably Butters. I love his innocence and gullibility.

&gt;&gt;**Swedeniscold**: Favorite main character is probably Butters. But my favorite ever is probably the old 'Don't go down that raawd' Pet Sematary Guy.

   
&gt;&gt;**SativaSteve**: Eric Cartman, intolerant asshole known to humanity. and i love him for it. &lt;3


&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

A couple of decades ago, turned you down but before he died, left you a video game in his will because he wanted you to be right – your future would depend on video games.

Okay, *Journey to the Center Hawkthorne*, was actually created by fans.  Actually, one fan created the game itself, but then other fans chipped in ideas for character costumes, art, and other feedback

Over at /r/hawkthorne is the link to play test the game for yourself.  It’s currently available on OSX, and Linux.  If someone wants to tell me that’s all the systems, I don’t keep track of that kind of thing, only whether or not I can use something on my system, okay?  If after you play the game, you have any suggestions, you can share them at the subreddit.

So I had a talk with the mods at /r/hawkthorne because I just want to know how this kind of awesomeness happened just because some people were fans of a TV series.

&gt;#1. I know the subreddit came about after the game was already in development.  What made you decide to create the game in the first place?  And other mods

&gt;&gt;**Derferman** After I saw Digital Estate Planning

&gt;&gt;**jhoff** I think I decided to join this subreddit before I knew it even existed. I was a little late to the party, I thought to myself, ""I need to play this game. It needs to exist"". A quick google search later and I was hacking away at code.

&gt;&gt;**BoobATron4000** I wanted to be a part of this subreddit because what Derferman was trying to do was a prime example of what makes the Community fandom such a great one. After seeing what was being done

&gt;#2. *Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne* has become this wonderful fan-creation where literally anybody can pitch in ideas.  Let’s not even talk fan creation – what would it be like if more video games were created based on the input of the people actually playing it?  Do you think this kind of game development could really have legs in the future?

&gt;&gt;**Derferman** Developing a game out in the open is difficult. When anyone can contribute, as the community really has a good sense of things. The best part is that since the game is open source, anyone can make the changes they want and hope to get them in.

&gt;#3. Obviously, or is it going to be part of the main game, or maybe even some combination of the two?

&gt;&gt;**Derferman** It will be a combination of the two. We have some levels that were named

&gt;#4. What do you hope to accomplish overall with this game?

&gt;&gt;**Derferman** A faithful recreation of Digital Estate Planning and the ultimate fan tribute to Community as a whole.

&gt;#5.  I’m seriously impressed with this subreddit and the game itself

&gt;&gt;**Derferman** We're always looking for more help. Download the game

[When we first featured them](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/ld1wp/october_15_2011_rshittyaskscience_i_would_tell/) 6 months ago: **421 subscribers**

Hello there everyone! First important thing: here on SubredditOfTheDay we are celebrating our one-year anniversary with a whole month of theme weeks

Now, and I wanted to re-feature a sub that was both old enough to have developed appreciably, and which I was around for during the original feature. ShittyAskScience was the only sub that fitted the bill (by proxy!). It is the oldest and largest of my mod duties, and I have been with her through thick and thin right from the very beginning, so there was every danger that in my infatuation I would pick it over another, possibly more deserving subreddit. This would obviously be a serious dereliction of my duties to you, the reader, after much walking in the moonlight and staring across the wind-swept ocean and turning away silent and pensive when friends and loved-ones ask what terrible heavy thought it is that distracts me so I came to the conclusion that yes

ShittyAskScience, but it has blossomed into something so much more. At turns grotesque, beautiful, irritating and brilliant, the community constantly surprises. How has it changed? Its bigger. And more active. And also there is more fancy css (you go aagavin!). We hit many milestones since the first appearance on /r/srotd, probably the most interesting being nominated for best new subreddit and best small subreddit of 2011 (up against /r/subredditoftheday itself!) and having [our own article in the daily dot](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/reddit-r-shittyaskscience-ignorance-humor/), and have held many events

Here is the rest of the illustrious and devoted mod team to share with you their own personal stories of science gone shitty 


&gt;## Tell us a shitty science story!


&gt;&gt; **Psiman:** When I was young, I performed an impromptu experiment on the conductivity of the human body. Needless to say on a warm summers day with salty sweat on my hands, I formed an excellent conductor. The light lit up, and I am reasonably sure my heart did a backflip. After that I was hooked on shitty science for life.

&gt;&gt; **Googunk:** My parents always left copies of Scientific American in the bathroom, explained in terms which only a legitimately scientific person would appreciate. I know we're successful when a layman could read a post and say ""that makes perfect sense!""
My 2 shittiest science experiments would have been first at age 6, explode my dad's expensive Stihl wire cutters, and went unconscious for a few seconds because I didn't hold the cutters by the rubber part.
2nd I was 14


&gt;&gt; **aagavin** My earliest shitty experiments were based around food. I was around the age of 9 or 10. Left at home for about two days and didn't know or want to do any real cooking. So I experimented.
I learnt a lot of things that weekend about foods that should and shouldn't be mixed together. We'll start with the experiments that failed.
A whole meal in a blender. Never blend together a ham sandwich
Deep frying is kinda hard for a 10 year old without the proper equipment and chocolate bars should have there wrapper taken off before attempting to deep fry.
Bleach doesn't have the same affect on all surfaces.
Now for the ones that worked:
Kraft dinner make with chocolate milk is very awesome.
Peanut butter goes really well with nutella.
Also Peanut butter with a piece of lettuce gives it a nice crunch and contrasting flavors.


&gt;&gt; **jesushx** I used to do ""activities"" that were in my sisters' girl scout's handbook
But I preferred the kind of science practiced by my Dad.
A smoker, and my dad had to pull over and have my brothers pee on it to put it out. Then back on vacation we went, making a stop to trade in the car. (It was not the first time we left on vacation in one car and came home in another).
Another Dad/car spectacular science activity, a steep hill, and a car with failing brakes and many other cars. The brakes went out at the top of the hill and my dad calmly explained the physics of his actions while he swerved the car into the snowbanks lining the road, side to side, left to right, on both sides of the street, going about 40 mph, intact

Five year olds are inquisitive little creatures

/r/ExplainLikeImFive gives us the most basic explanation for complicated questions. The most important aspect of the answers lies in the namesake of the subreddit. Sometimes the answers get complicated

&gt; How do you feel about breaking the fastest growing subreddit record?

&gt;&gt; **bossgalaga**: It's pretty damned awesome for me, or moderated one either. The way people swarmed to it was amazing.

&gt;&gt; I guess it was just a good idea that resonated with people. As I've mentioned before

&gt; What are some explanations that you particularly like?

&gt;&gt; **bossgalaga**: I enjoy a lot of the science-related questions, and it's easy to get confused about what the importance of all it is (at least for me.) So I really enjoyed the posts about [US's credit rating being dropped](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jaers/eli5_how_does_the_us_credit_rating_that_went_down/), [the actual workings on the floor of the stock exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j6wa5/what_the_hell_goes_on_on_the_floor_of_the_stock/), and of course the answer to my original question that started it all, the explanation of the debt ceiling.. The top and supplementary comments in all these threads are fantastic.

&gt;&gt; I love the fact that some of the great explanations use allegory

&gt; Has there been much trouble keeping answers at a five year old's level?

&gt;&gt; **Dr_Merkwurdigliebe**: We're working hard to keep it there, but even more are spot on.

&gt;&gt; **bossgalaga**: I feel like we're beginning to level off in our adjustment period. Especially in the last few days -- the community really seems to have coalesced in opinion

&gt;&gt; Still, and the fact we've been growing so quickly. We get a pretty high amount of questions each day. So we try to urge people that if their submission doesn't show up, to let us know so we can take a look. I'm proud of the fact that so far, we've been able to respond to every request we get in a very short time.

&gt; Your moderator mail must be aflame constantly.

&gt;&gt; **bossgalaga**: I didn't even know the little Snoo icon could change to anything but orangered for the first five days.

&gt;&gt; We get a lot of messages about specific posts, helps to make the effort of moderating totally worth it.

&gt; Any final word for our readers?

&gt;&gt; **bossgalaga**: I know that this will sound like complete pandering, at our core, the majority of people here want to learn something. What that ""something"" is may be vastly different from one Redditor to the next, but we really seem to enjoy expanding each others' worldview in some way. I know that's what drew me here in the first place. So it's really cool to be a part of continuing that aspect of the culture here.

&gt;&gt; And finally -- if you ever have an idea for a subreddit of your own

&gt;&gt; **whats8**: This has been a sweet experience so far. I currently moderate a few subreddits (shameless plug: check out r/ProgMetal), going from &lt;2k readers to &lt;40k, but I look forward to continuing my services as this subreddit grows.

&gt;&gt; To both the askers and answerers of this /r/: keep doing your shit. I love you all.

I’m pretty lucky that I grew up when I did.  See, in boxes somewhere, photographic evidence that I was an adorable and stylish kid in the late 80s, there’s not that many pictures of me from the 90s until 2005.

Thank god.  I was an embarrassing teenager.  Well, and nobody wanted to deal with my curly hair, so I had to keep it in a single braid all the time and it didn’t look good.  I tried to wear pigtails on a more regular basis because that at least looked cute, but my hair still frizzed all the time.  And also, they didn’t look cute.  Also, it was the 90s and almost all my jeans were bell bottoms and cargo pants.   Okay, that part was my fault.  Also, like, *now*.

But if I did have pictures, as is being creepy.  It’s a place to commiserate.

I sat down with the mods of /r/blunderyears to ask some questions.

&gt;#1. Who came up with the subreddit name

&gt;&gt;**cbrandolino** It was /u/Mister_Shadys idea. When I proposed this subreddit on a thread in /r/cringepics a few names were suggested

&gt;#2. Why were you inspired to be a part of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Seriou** It's awesome to have (the illusion of) responsibility for something of moderate size. Plus it's a great subreddit with lots of potential.

&gt;&gt;**VonSandwich** I became inspired to be a part of this subreddit because there seemed to be a lot of ""self-cringe"" in/r/cringepics, look back, and just feel embarrassed for themselves. It's just great when those embarrassing things have been recorded somehow.

&gt;&gt;**cbrandolino** /u/VonSandwich said it best.

&gt;#3. Have you posted any pictures yet?

&gt;&gt;**Seriou** No.  God

&gt;&gt;**VonSandwich** I didn't post any pictures

&gt;&gt;**cbrandolino** Not yet. My past is so embarrassing that every other post would pale in comparison

&gt;#4. If you could have a conversation with your embarrassing younger self

&gt;&gt;**Seriou** Jesus Christ stop being so sensitive they're teasing.

&gt;&gt;**VonSandwich** I would tell myself that happiness does not revolve around being with someone. Being loved by a man does not make you happy. So just enjoy your creativeness while you can

&gt;&gt;**cbrandolino** Don't worry

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you’d like to add?

&gt;&gt;**Seriou** Tomi

&gt;&gt;**VonSandwich** We're not here to judge you as a person now. But we are here to laugh with you about how lame you used to be. Don't worry

You have reached the end of the internet. The fabled land. The promised land. 

####[There are girls here.](http://i.imgur.com/Ic9EG.gif)

Now before you go getting all excited, have issues much the same as guys. Actually, let me rephrase that: [girls have issues, many of which are FAR WORSE THAN ANY MAN COULD EVER IMAGINE.](http://i.imgur.com/K2tAv.gif)

/r/TrollXChromosomes is the subreddit where women don't just talk about their issues; they make them into memes. This subreddit does more to [resolve gender issues](http://i.imgur.com/q2mNq.gif) than Men Are From Mars

[**Women actually Fart.**](http://i.imgur.com/rWPM7.gif)

[**Women like Shark Week. I think?**](http://i.imgur.com/wA6tQ.gif)

[**I never ever ever ever want a uterus. Ever.**](http://i.imgur.com/izDwe.gif)

So I decided to speak with the moderators to get my facts straight.

&gt; TrollXChromosomes?! What precipitated this idea?

&gt;&gt;**HiFructoseCornFeces:** Sodypop created this subreddit to give us a nice place to put 2x memes without taking over 2x.

&gt;&gt;**SodyPop (Subreddit Creator):** I originally created /r/TrollXChromosomes as a CSS test bed for the 2011 April Fools' Day prank in TwoXchromosomes. After several complaints about rage comics taking over the 2X front page

&gt; What is the relationship between this subreddit and /r/TwoXChromosomes?

&gt;&gt;**HiFructoseCornFeces:** It's good! I created 2x

&gt;&gt;**SodyPop:** I see the two subreddits as being complimentary to each other. TrollX is more light hearted and 2X can get into some rather serious debate at times. Many users view them both at once using [this multi link](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes+TrollXChromosomes) to keep a healthy balance.

&gt; Foul Bachelor Frog gets some serious play on this reddit. Those anecdotes cant be true...can they?!?

&gt;&gt;**HiFructoseCornFeces:** Totally true.

&gt;&gt;**SodyPop:** It turns out women and men are evenly disgusting creatures.

&gt; What's your favourite TrollX submission of all time?

&gt;&gt;**HiFructoseCornFeces:** The one about farting in the car at night and the boyfriend the next morning smells it and asks if she had Taco Bell.

&gt;&gt;**SodyPop:** It's a toss up between [waterfall boobs](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/comments/ues89/one_of_my_favorite_parts_of_being_in_the_shower/) and [jaunty cooter (NSFW).](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/comments/kwnuy/it_was_funnier_than_i_expected_nsfw/)

&gt; Have you ever seen a TrollX submission that made you cringe?

&gt;&gt;**HiFructoseCornFeces:** No.

&gt;&gt;**SodyPop:** I'm a guy

&gt; What makes TrollX the best meme subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**HiFructoseCornFeces:** Sheer honesty.

&gt;&gt;**SodyPop:** The community members are what makes the subreddit great! I also love that many of the memes often tend to reflect current issues and generate excellent discussion threads.

&gt; Any words for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**HiFructoseCornFeces:** Lol

&gt;&gt;**SodyPop:** Keep being awesome and thanks for all the lulz!

Who doesn't love a good anti-hero? Especially one that [likes the ladies](http://art3.server01.sheezyart.com/image/238/2385509.jpg), and is [savvy to internet culture?](http://i.imgur.com/53T2p.jpg)

Put all those together

/r/Deadpool is a fan-run subreddit that pays homage to the smart-mouthed anti-hero

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **ThePunisher56** This subreddit was actually started as a game in which people would name celebrities and people who they thought would die within the next year.

&gt;&gt;A few people including myself found this to be a dead subreddit and rallied to get it on the subject of the Marvel character. Through the community

&gt;&gt;**xandel434** ...fun fact

&gt;&gt;[In the comics, since he would never die. The comic was ""Deadpool &amp; Death Annual 1998.""

&gt;&gt;**jimmick** Dude


&gt;##2. What about Deadpool appeals to you?
&gt;&gt;  **ThePunisher56** The biggest thing that appeals to me about Deadpool is that he has everything

&gt;&gt;He has money, action, adventure, witty humor, a very underestimated intelligence, multi-personality conversations, is suicide-inducingly annoying and virtually indestructible. 

&gt;&gt;Yet


&gt;##3. Describe your favorite scene featuring Deadpool.
&gt;&gt;  **ThePunisher56** My favorite scene is from the comic ""Deadpool Volume 3: X Marks the Spot""

&gt;&gt;He is having a conversation with himself and telling himself he has everything he could possibly want. His other ""personality"" says something along the lines of ""Yet you have no one."" It was such a small part in the comic but it still stands out to this day.


&gt;##4. If you could trade lives with Deadpool for a day
&gt;&gt; **ThePunisher56** I would probably do exactly as he is doing now

&gt;##5. Which character
&gt;&gt; **ThePunisher56** Toby Maguire's *Spiderman* while Andrew Garfield's *Amazing Spiderman* sat there making jokes. Can I do that? Because that would be just super.

&gt;##6. Did Ryan Reynolds do Deadpool justice in the X-men movie? [(Here's a picture of him in-character... for science of course.)](http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/deadpool.jpg)
&gt;&gt; **ThePunisher56** Technically... No. 

&gt;&gt;He got the Merc mannerisms down and the skills

&gt;##7. Which comic would you recommend to people interested in getting to know Deadpool?
&gt;&gt; **ThePunisher56** I would have to say it doesn't matter. 

&gt;&gt;A good start would be ""Cable &amp; Deadpool


&gt;##8. Anything you'd like to say to your hoarde of Merciless Mercs?
&gt;&gt; **ThePunisher56** Chimichangas!! 

&gt;&gt;Also

&gt;&gt;This is actually the second time I had to write this interview

  
So there you have it from the 3 fabulous mods of /r/Deadpool

I have spent ages laughing at the pictures over at /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces. It’s just refreshing to see pictures of girls laughing at themselves but also making fun of the falseness of pictures. It’s just genuinely entertaining to see exactly what the title suggest. [They]( http://i.imgur.com/tUha9Do.jpg) [are](http://i.imgur.com/rbXuU4dh.jpg) [pretty]( http://i.imgur.com/SMBY9Hhh.jpg) and [they](http://i.imgur.com/fg7kAXg.jpg) [make](http://i.imgur.com/2G7ugU4h.jpg) [uglies](http://i.imgur.com/uyiiXnd.jpg). It’s a simple premise that is funny as hell and has a sense of honesty about it that I think is pretty neat.

I know for a fact that they like [the gifs](http://imgur.com/xJYUnXN)

A fair set of rules keeps /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces in check. The mods enforce them so the sub isn’t clogged up with bullying or creepiness. /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces don’t tolerate that intolerance. As /u/caindaddy said to me:

&gt;&gt; **caindaddy** I guess if I were to have one thing to say

It’s that kind stern moderating that keeps the subreddit fresh and is only beneficial to keeping /r/PrettyGirlyUglyFaces awesome. Keeping the content positive and keeping the negatives out! As said before

Anyways

&gt;##1. How did /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces come to be?

&gt;&gt; **Catness_NeverClean**  If you go in my submission history about a year back, he saw potential for growth and made it happen. We have been floored by the responses within reddit and outside of it. If you google ""pretty girls,"" it will automatically fill the rest in with ""ugly faces."" It's pretty cool how I see it everywhere. Tumblr, Instagram, YouTube, and some pretty popular blogs and news sites!

&gt;&gt; **Sinkingfast** /u/Catness_NeverClean and her sister made a post about how they have perfected making faces over the years. It made the front page. It seemed like an interesting

&gt;##2. What sparked your interest in pretty girls making ugly faces?

&gt;&gt; **Catness_NeverClean** My sister (/u/jellybeannose) and I have been doing it since we were children. We did it to spite our mother, and I have fond memories of perfecting our faces together.

&gt;&gt; **Sinkingfast** I honestly just found the notion of it hilarious. /u/Catness_NeverClean was the inspiration for the subreddit and I believed it to be entertaining enough to sustain itself as a regular feature rather than just a singular

&gt;##3. I think your subreddit has a really positive message

&gt;&gt; **Catness_NeverClean** Yes! I am big on the social justice front and love love love helping women learn to love themselves. I believe PGUF has broken down so many barriers in the way people view women and the way they view themselves. It is a big ""in your face"" to the media and to society's standards of beauty. In fact

&gt;&gt; **Sinkingfast** Thanks! I actually think it does, yeah, you can do this...but you need to look attractive while you do it."" There's nothing wrong with wanting to look appealing at any given time but it should by no means be an obligation for either sex. We want this to be a safe, fun place for women and men alike to be able to just make silly and ridiculous faces. One of the reasons we are quite strict when it comes to the rules is because if we let those types of negative comments go unchecked people will no longer want to post here. And if those negative comments are posted it just reenforces society's unfortunate standard that you're only worth your own beauty.

&gt;##4. Do you have a submission that is a personal favourite? 

&gt;&gt; **Catness_NeverClean** Without a second thought

&gt;&gt; **Sinkingfast** Um, and spring boarded it into widespread knowledge and use. Fun!

&gt;##5. Thank you for your answers! Do you have anything you'd like to say to the /r/PrettyGirlsUglyFaces community? 	

&gt;&gt; **Catness_NeverClean** Oh my gosh, and everybody who puts themselves on the line for the rest of us to get laughs from! Inspiring this sub and moderating it is my life's biggest accomplishment, and I couldn't be more proud!

&gt;&gt; **Sinkingfast** Thank you for your time. I just want to thank our community for being awesome. It's difficult enough to post a normal photo of yourself online but you post photos of yourself at your absolute worst and silliest, subscribers...you're all incredibly supportive. There may be a few trolls here and there but the majority of you are overwhelmingly supportive to our content submitters which is great because it encourages others to post. I also need to thank /u/Catness_NeverClean &amp; /u/CainDaddy as there is absolutely no way I could moderate this on my own. Nor would we have the awesome CSS without /u/CainDaddy and his skills. We're at just over 16,000 subscribers and it's awesome to see that number continue to grow. Without the combination of the moderators keeping things in check and our submitters consistently producing quality material we would never have grown this large. So...Thanks!

Phew! There you have it

Riding a wooden board down a snowy hill has been a thing for [thousands of years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_skiing) So of course it would have it's own subreddit. What's the attraction though? Why spend a heap of money to get cold

[Mainly

Each year 6, searching for [good snow and blue bird skies.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0_gYlo6T1w) Some go to ride [champagne powder.](http://i.imgur.com/QD3b7.gif) Some go to [hit big air.](http://i.imgur.com/EWWjZ.gif) Some go to [spin,](http://i.imgur.com/gHn10.gif) and some go to [jib.](http://i.imgur.com/FzobA.gif)

Of course everyone [has to start somewhere.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33RUIJ6fYc) Not everyone can ride like [Shaun White.](http://i.imgur.com/npDpp.gif) No doubt

/r/Snowboarding is a great place to start learning about riding. From culture to gear tips to [trick pointers](http://i.imgur.com/utDjC.gif)

I dropped in with the moderators to find out more:

&gt; How long have you been riding and what do you ride?

&gt;&gt; **joejance:** I started riding in the winter of 1988 if memory serves. My first board was a Burton Cruiser 165 with the split tail which made it fantastic in powder. We used to build jumps on a hill near my house

&gt;&gt; I currently split my time between a T.Rice Pro and a Burton Custom Flying-V depending on conditions and riding, or if a friend needs to borrow a spare board.

&gt;&gt; **david_z:** I've been riding since the early/mid-1990s on and off when I was a kid (when I didn't have enough money) and thru college (where I had other priorities...) but more frequently now that I'm all ""grown up"". I've got this Marhar deck that I rode a lot last year but probably will just thrash that as a park/street deck

&gt;&gt; **raarky:** 12 years

&gt; Favourite mountain you have been to?

&gt;&gt; **joejance:**  Meadowlark Wyoming. It is a tiny place with 1000ft of drop but it is in the middle of nowhere with no crowds, with fresh groomers and pow). The lodging is cheap and the food is awesome too, so a pretty good experience. I think adult lift tickets are $42 this year. You really have to keep an eye on weather because if you are going back over the pass it is a long, long drive is shitty weather. I would also give props to Breck and Red Lodge. The Drainage at Red Lodge made me a man. I know there are a lot of awesome mountains out there that put Meadowlark to shame; I just haven't visited.

&gt;&gt; **david_z:** Brighton UT. It's a good-sized mountain but not too big, and has terrain that suits every skill level.

&gt;&gt; **raarky:** The Mayrhofen Zillertal area is a favourite. Loads of terrain with easy access and best of all

&gt;&gt; But in the end, cloudy day on Turoa with my crew back home in NZ (I miss yall) is better than anything in the world.

&gt; Favourite trick you have landed?

&gt;&gt; **joejance:**  Back in the day we use to have a couple of logs hidden away for log slides (well before terrain parks) along the sides of some trails. I remember some friends and I propping one up with a drop below it, and the first 30 foot cliff too. I remember both bindings ripping out of a K2 I owned later in high school landing a 3. They really didn't have manufacturing down yet. I ended up drilling in from the bottom and counter-sinking skateboard t-nuts from the bottom, then just waxing over them. I might have dripped some p-tex in too. So any of those are pretty memorable.

&gt;&gt; **david_z:** I got in to the terrain park game really late in life (30?), first try ever, surprised me and the guy I was riding with, like it wasn't a super gnar rail or anything but you have to understand that I'd never spun on to a rail before and so that was just like an ""AH! I GOT IT!"" moment that convinced me I wasn't too old for this shit and that yes, Charlotte, I can 270 on rails (sometimes!) and keep progressing even though I'm old.

&gt;&gt; **raarky:** Back 3 off a cornice into knee deep pow on an epic day at Kicking Horse

&gt; Tell us about /r/snowboarding. What is your most memorable moment on the subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **joejance:** I really like seeing people getting into snowboarding

&gt;&gt; **david_z:** Favorite part about this sub is that it's generally really positive and supportive, lessons &amp; trick tips, etc., and 99.9% of the sub is really good about just encouraging people and getting everyone stoked to get out and board. Keep it that way!!!

&gt;&gt; **raarky:** Realizing that the community is full of really awesome shredders that simply want to do the same thing as me - ride as much as possible

&gt; What's your favourite submission?

&gt;&gt; **joejance:**  http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/fqh3j/learning_spins/

&gt;&gt; **david_z:** [This one, it's just a rad looking futuresphere perched on a mountain that OP wants to stuff with A&amp;W... Hard to pick favorites, though.

&gt;&gt; **raarky:** I love this vid because it really sums up the style of riding me and my mates are into: http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/jdyuv/been_trying_to_stay_away_from_snowboard_clips_for/

&gt;&gt; Also

&gt; What is your relationship with /r/skiing?

&gt;&gt; **joejance:**  I have not spent much time over there. In the real world I have a good relationship with skiers in general. I have friends that ski. That wasn't always the case. When I was in high school 20 years ago the mountain I now call home, and in general everyone just has a good attitude.

&gt;&gt;You still run into some anti-shredder sentiments from occasional skiers, and teach this to my nephews who also snowboard with me. This not only helps out someone else but makes your day better too. This isn't to say I haven't told someone to stick it!

&gt;&gt; **david_z:** Nothing against skiers but I don't spend any time there. I occasionally read ""SKI"" magazine

&gt;&gt; **raarky:** None really. I dont know how to ski :) But we are all after the same thing

&gt;Any words to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **joejance:** Get our there and shred because you never know when you might be landing your last 3 or 5 or 7 or whatever. Be nice to people. Have fun.

&gt;&gt; **david_z:** Snowboarding is fun.

&gt;&gt; **raarky:** There's pow in them thar hills. Go find it and tear it up.

The most moderation we do here is the typical spam and reports stuff and checking images to see if they are rehosted but the images submitted to /r/roomporn are some of the hardest images to source since they bounce around on blogs all day long.

Ireland, so I will just leave this little list of things that non-nationals should know about:

**Riverdance** - It's become something of a punchline

**Tommy Tiernan** - Irish comedian and genius. Some say his new stuff is shite. They are correct. But [his old stuff is one long string of unbelievably fantastic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph7XHGmj1NA)

**James Joyce’s Ulysses** - People used to try and write literature

Here are the denizens of /r/Ireland to give you some further insights into the blessing and curse that is Irishness:

&gt;## Drinking

&gt;&gt; **Gurphy:** You have to get fucked a minimum of 2 nights a week.
And thats not in the sexual sense

&gt;## Working

&gt;&gt; **sonneti:** Everyone is skint

&gt;## Confrontation

&gt;&gt; **HaroldHaroldson:** Irish people aren't as 'mad' or as 'wild' as they sometimes like to think. A great deal of Irish people are reticent. If they're unhappy with a meal in a restaurant, or they may complain about it there and then to their family or friends, but when the waiter/waitress comes around asking if everything is alright, they'll give an emphatic ""yep! fine!""

&gt;&gt; **Beaudelier:** Lets be fair

&gt;## St. Patrick's day

&gt;&gt; **Frumtastic:** Paddy's day here in Westmeath usually entails climbing a hill that was ""blessed"" by St Patrick
Then off to watch the parade which is basically a few dodgy floats pulled by tractors from the 1950s and narrated by some clown with a microphone
and then spend the rest of the day getting twisted with the rest of the village.

We cannot know for certain, what musical cogs may be whirling behind his as-yet beardless visage, but we may imagine that as he sits there thinking and stroking his bare chin the still small voice of inspiration begins to whisper deep within his being. The wry smile, which in coming years will become obscured by his trademark bushy beard, flashes for a moment as the ideas take shape and crystalize. Quickly, before they fade, he bounds to his desk and scrabbles through his work things where, he finds the writing equipment. Tentatively he begins to write, examines one more time the form

If this is not what you expect classical music to be like, with equal fervor, declare the classic modes of expression such as the symphony and sonata to be outmoded and outdated, and would urge you to support only avant-garde works such as the one reproduced above. How to choose? In the battle of the beards, do you go with the time-honored and carefully-tended Brahms, or the wild and unpredictable La Monte Young? Well, that’s where today's featured sub comes in. The wonderful community at /r/ClassicalMusic can be a beacon in the stylistic tempest that is the 21st century, or just somewhere to ask about dinner-jackets. A big thank-you to the hard-working mods for answering my questions below


&gt;## How did you get into classical music? Is it a major part of your life

&gt;&gt; **siddboots** It is a hobby for me

&gt;## What does classical music have to offer the modern redditor?

&gt;&gt; **siddboots** Everyone, the magesty of a Romantic symphony, the effortlessness of a Chopin *Nocturne*. Classical music is just *enjoyable*, regardless of your level of technical understanding.

&gt;&gt; There's also an implication in this question that classical music can't be ""modern""

&gt;&gt; The truth is that contemporary classical is alive, and more performers playing, than at any other time in history. 

&gt;&gt; Classical is also informing popular music more than ever. It is hard to exagurate the impact that classical minimalism has had on the experimental EDM, who bear and cite direct influences. Not to mention entire movements of post-rock and folk that make claims to some kind of ""fusion"".

&gt;## What advice would you give to someone who wants to get into classical music

&gt;&gt; **Epistaxis** There's a FAQ for that! [I'm new to classical music

&gt;## Why should everyone subscribe to /r/ClassicalMusic?

&gt;&gt; **Epistaxis** Even if you think you're fairly informed yourself, you can actually get a meaningful response about what they were trying to say with their metamusic and how many other works have been inspired by it.

&gt;&gt; We're also really good at naming that tune from that one video. And we have a sense of humor too. Today I saw [this set of variations on the ""Nyan Cat"" theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHABmjWOX5o), even [from our own redditors](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/pfqzs/reddit_i_hope_you_like_my_improvised_waltz_on_the/).

&gt;&gt; **siddboots** Thanks to Epistaxis, and perhaps become a weekly thing. This sort of discussion can be a great way to explore music that you might not ordinarily have time for; other people's enthusiam is always a great motivator for trying new things.

Before you even ask

Moving right along: ahem. Philosophers often ponder: *""If reddit is the frontpage of the Internet

Enter /r/subredditoftheday. Every single day, bringing it to the fore and giving it the exposure it deserves. People new to the reddit experience are exposed to the vast array of what reddit is capable of while reddit veterans are turned on to ideas and communities they never imagined could exist. 

Better yet, and even more nefarious acts, /r/subredditoftheday gives you the skinny of every subreddit that it features.

Earlier this year I was able to e-mail /r/subredditoftheday's creator

***

&gt;Your nickname is SRotD. The subreddit is called /r/SubRedditOfTheDay. Coincidence?
 
&gt;&gt;**SRotD**: I took over Subreddit of the Day from my father who inherited it from his father before him.  We lived on a family farm located on the South side of Chicago.  It was a very small farm about the size of a typical urban backyard.
 
&gt;&gt;Both my grandfather and father were good men who worked the land with primitive tools and a team of strong corgis.  They'd work in the sun for hours trying to grow the subreddits to feed our family, other years we'd go hungry. One year I remember we had subreddits like /r/pics and /r/gonewild!  Other years, nothing but spacedicks.
 
&gt;&gt;I was a shy boy, faint, regain consciousness and then weep some more!  Oh how my dancing brought such joy!
 
&gt;&gt;On my fourteenth birthday
 
&gt;&gt;Today, and are paid in corgi meat.  Those little muscle bullets are mostly dark meat, but they fit nicely in a slow cooker.  (Protip, a medium corgi and diet Dr. Pepper and you got a stew!)  As a tip-of-the-hat to my first love, I changed my user name from ProudGary to SRotD, which is short for *Superhero Randy of the Dance*.
 
&gt;Looking through /r/SROTD's history
 
&gt;&gt;**SRotD**: This is such a Goddamn excellent question!  I don't know how you do it jmk4422!
 
&gt;&gt;I once read an article about Mike Doughty, writing is just like working out or running.  Slowly building that muscle.
 
&gt;&gt;Another thing that motivated me to write often was a conversation I had with someone in /r/guitar (a favourite sub of mine).  Here's the story... this guy had posted about buying guitar gear, mature, well spoken, gracious, this guy was a 10 out of 10... something that I'd love to be.  This experience made me realize how you can be whoever you want to be, both in real life and on reddit.  So SRotD was created as the guy I want to be.  He's helpful, enthusiastic, professional and totally willing to take an idea and run with it into the next dimension.  Me in real life
 
&gt;&gt;Sadly
 
&gt;/r/SubredditOfTheDay is pretty: great graphics
 
&gt;&gt;**SRotD**: Jaxspider is the man responsible for everything.  BauerUK
 
&gt;&gt;Jax has worked an unbelievable number of hours as a moderator and artist.  We'll never be able to fully thank jax for his efforts due to his inability to accept praise, or kind, selfless or devoted... jax you are definitely a person.

&gt;JaxSpider

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider**: Originally there was very little code. Syncretic, I finished what he started. This is why, in the sidebar he has ""paid his debt to society.""

&gt;&gt;As for accomplishments
 
&gt;Do you prefer highlighting small/niche subreddits
 
&gt;&gt;**SRotD**: This is another incredible question!  I'll be right back.  I need a moment.
 
&gt;&gt;Every subreddit I look at
 
&gt;&gt;I wish I could have a clear answer for you, our readers, the beautiful people.

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider**: My personal preference is to highlight small reddits. I look for reddits that are diamonds in the rough. For me that means anywhere from 300~7,000, that I won't feature it. I love rooting for the little guy.

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific**: As much as I love finding something for everyone, but they have dedicated fans to keep the group thriving.
 
&gt;In an ideal world
 
&gt;&gt;**SRotD**: I don't know of any other worlds, all of whom are very attractive.  In 6 months, we'll be around 15K where knuckleheads will start to join the party.  They'll say stuff like, ""you think you're funny but you write like shit!  It's too much to read!  Why don't you just do a summary so I can get back to watching Hoarders.""  There'll be backlash and we'll become uncool.  We'll lose some readers and imitators will arise where they pick a subreddit each day and don't do write ups.  Then the Son of God will return to walk among us.  He'll bring forth the four corgis of the apocalypse and Judgment Day will come.  Those who have sinned (imitators of Subreddit of the Day) will be sent to the firey depths of hell.  The rest of us will most likely move into their houses and eat anything that isn't way past the expiration date.  You know, give it a sniff test before you eat it.

&gt;&gt;**JaxSpider**: We are headed for the top baby. If my calculations are correct

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific**: In Hollywood. SubredditOfTheDay: The Movie. Reddit Platinum members get in free to the premiere.

The term ""girl gamers"" is [mired in controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_video_games). It's been used as a derogatory label to describe [women who use gaming solely to get attention](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrjqsmAtiv1r3nb12o1_500.png)

To the ladies of /r/GirlGamers

If you're not a girl or *are* but have never accidentally or purposely identified yourself as such while online, I guess, but that doesn't mean we have to put up with their shit.

In /r/GirlGamers, parodies [mocking/dispelling the ""gamer girl"" stereotype](http://i.imgur.com/zft7C.jpg), and some [kick-ass cosplays](http://imgur.com/a/3xeVN). 

You'll also find some [awesome gaming-related OC](http://i.imgur.com/J7aOR.jpg) that'll never make it past /r/GirlGamers friendly borders because a herd of immature kids always post [this picture](http://todayilearned.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/how-men-and-women-take-photos.jpg) to criticize the poster of ""karma whoring"" [like they did to this /r/GirlGamers poster](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/sr75a/for_mass_effect_fans_i_tried_to_post_this_pic_to/) for being a girl and being in the picture (though [she doesn't even always have to be to get shit for it](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/xxe95/rgaming_has_hurt_my_gamer_girl_feelings/)). Hell, like I said earlier, nowhere else. 

So are you down like Charlie Brown? Can you handle the delightfully diverse posts from some gamer girls who [have a love of the traditionally girly](http://i.imgur.com/bQ53wBgl.jpg)

If so, you'll be able to find a home here! Also, follow their rules and again, don't be a douche.

Here today to tell us more about /r/GirlGamers is its founding mod

&gt;#1. What inspired you to create r/GirlGamers?

&gt;&gt;**lingrush** It was difficult for me to find other women who enjoying gaming to the extent that I did, and the general response was that it didn't exist or why should it exist and how dare I segregate women isn't that like reverse-sexism?

&gt;&gt;Eventually I found myself in possession of this subreddit; the name was an accident but I decided to roll with it because we had a bunch (30 seemed like a lot at the time) of subscribers already. I'm actually pretty uncomfortable the term 'girl gamer' and initially thought I would work against the use of that term

&gt;#2. What would you say sets your sub apart from most other gaming subs?


&gt;&gt;**lingrush**I like to think the sub is more community-oriented and supportive. I made it to facilitate the meeting of female gamers who enjoyed games in the same capacity that I did

&gt;&gt;I really appreciate the combination of camaraderie and thoughtful discourse

&gt;&gt;We've received a ton of gratitude from female gamers who subsequently felt much less isolated after taking part in the gaming/discussions. I always get deep feels from those messages.

&gt;#3. Does r/GirlGamers hold any gaming events


&gt;&gt;**lingrush**We occasionally host gaming meet ups through our Steam and Facebook group. We're currently discussing a more formalized method of organizing events! (right

&gt;#4. Have you guys had any problems with trolls or other ne'er-do-wells?


&gt;&gt;**lingrush**We used to all the time in its first months (and occasionally when it hits /r/all or is cross-posted to /r/gaming)

&gt;&gt;So surprisingly

&gt;#5. What would you say is your favorite game and why?


&gt;&gt;**lingrush**Marathon; the graphics were super sick. I liked that it had more narrative than shooters both now and back then

&gt;&gt;I'm probably putting it on this pedestal because I played it before I got super jaded about games and still played with childlike glee/terror.

&gt;#6. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?


&gt;&gt;**lingrush** I'm so, keep making everybody else angry. That means you're doing something right, right?",,False,self,t5_2sgno,,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1f0f39/may_25_2013_rgirlgamers_a_place_for_women_who/

Sandwiches are amazing!

When we are [rushing to the office or school](http://michaelhyatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/iStock_000009381744Small.jpg) or having a nice snack in the evening or let it be dinner or lunch

Of course there is absolutely no way someone doesnt know what a sandwich is but many dont know the different varieties of sandwiches. From being filled in [nutella](http://cdn.blogs.babble.com/family-kitchen/files/2012/10/Nutella-Sandwich.jpg)(one of my favourites! :D) to [mac-n-cheese](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljvl7kcNog1qz9bugo1_500.jpg) to [ham-n-cheese](http://www.bradbrown.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ham-and-cheese-sandwich.jpg) to sandwiches with LOTS of ingredients ... sandwiches come in unlimited types of varieties.  
If i remember right i have even seen shows on televisions who search for the best sandwiches in the country and the world! This shows how diverse and delicious sandwiches can be :)

I am sure each of you may have some sandwich as the best sandwich you have ever tasted but personally mine's ties between the cheese and potato sandwich (weird combination right ?) which my mom makes and the sandwich in one of the shops in my city! Both are AMAZING! I am [really hungry](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PF5tAhWoB1E/TZ4GJvR4Z3I/AAAAAAAAAbY/xowCnIOJkHc/s1600/hungry-dog%5B1%5D.jpg) already thinking about it :D

As i said earlier

So i sat down with the moderator of /r/eatsandwiches for a delicious interview! :D

&gt;##1. What inspires/motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**Socially_awkward_pen:** I moderate /r/eatsandwiches for two reasons. 1 because I love sandwiches

&gt;##2. which is the best sandwich you have ever eaten ?
&gt;&gt;**Socially_awkward_pen:** the best sandwich I've ever eaten was a BlT I had at a local restaurant

&gt;##3. which is the best sandwich you can prepare ? :D
&gt;&gt;**Socially_awkward_pen:** the best sandwich I can prepare would probably be a classic ham and cheese. I don't eat much fancy sandwiches

&gt;##4. which is your favourite sandwich ?
&gt;&gt;**Socially_awkward_pen:** My favorite sandwich would probably be a cheeseburger (that's technically a sandwich right?) or any type of bagel sandwich.

&gt;##5. If you were to die and god gave you a wish to eat one sandwich before you die
&gt;&gt;**Socially_awkward_pen:** if I got to choose one sandwich to be given to me when I die

&gt;##6. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Socially_awkward_pen:** I would like to thank our current subscribers for providing us with great content. And to future subscribers please come join us if you enjoy sandwiches

Thank you so much for reading!

/r/GamingPC is a subreddit that is dedicated to high end gaming computers that are hand built by their owners. What does high end really mean? How can you distinguish between a stick of DDR3-1600 RAM with a CAS latency of 6ns and another stick with the same data rate but with a CAS latency of 9ns? Apart from the price

The point is building the sickest machine you can

/r/GamingPC leaves it all in the arena. Can you get an extra 10 FPS by doubling the price of half your hardware? Do it. No one here is going to give you shit just because you blew the budget right out the window and then some. If the end result is that you are happy with what you have created

I built a new machine about 5 months ago. [It was straightforward.](http://i.imgur.com/ocSrK.gif) I did it after watching a couple of youtube vids and chatting with the folks at #reddit-gamingpc on freenode. The build went off without a hitch, and after [hamfisting](http://i.imgur.com/D4OYx.gif) it myself, checked briefly with the IRC channel to get some ideas, and was [promptly up and running](http://i.imgur.com/HhNhG.gif) to the full capabilities of the upgrade.

So in order to highlight the great service this subreddit provides

&gt; What is your PC building background?

&gt;&gt;**Markus_Antonius (subreddit creator):** I opened up my first computer together with my father in 1982 in order to repair it. Ever since this time I've loved the hardware and software aspects of computers. Software is now my work but I've worked for companies that also design hardware (including graphics cards). Hardware is still my number one hobby :-)

&gt;&gt;**BoboForShort:** About a year ago I built my first computer with help from a coworker, and upgrading things. It just makes me happy and I love to learn everything I can get my hands on.

&gt;&gt;**manirelli:** I've been planning to build a computer since i was in 8th grade. My father used to work on computers and always seem to know how to make anything electronic simply work. I always envied that ability of his and it drove me to almost an obsession over learning about hardware. From there it was simply a means of gaining the necessary funds to fulfill my dream...

&gt;&gt;**ThoughtA:** Over the past several years

&gt; What are some of the highlights of your own system?

&gt;&gt;**Markus_Antonius:** Currently I love my computer case (Silverstone Raven RV02) and I'm impressed with my CPU and mainboard (Intel Core i7 3930K and Asus Rampage IV Formula).

&gt;&gt;**BoboForShort:** I love everything about my system. If I had to pick one thing it would have to be the power and speed behind it. There's not a game out there I can't blow away. Coming from barely being able to play Minecraft to this is so amazing and never stops putting a smile on my face. That and it [looks good](http://imgur.com/a/U2E7K) to match.

&gt;&gt;**manirelli:** For me

&gt;&gt;**ThoughtA:** My current highlight is successfully pushing 7680x1440 on modern games. There's something about flying over Caspian border with nothing but sky in your peripherals

&gt; Love the design of your subreddit! Who is responsible for that? Do you have any changes or updates planned?

&gt;&gt;**Markus_Antonius:** As answered by manirelli I'm responsible for the design with the exception of the top banner. Since we hit 10

&gt;&gt;**BoboForShort:** That's really Markus's baby. He does amazing things I can't even begin to understand. There's so much going on behind the scenes I wouldn't even know how to explain it anyway. 

&gt;&gt;**manirelli:** Markus with a little help from M625 are responsible for the design of the sub. We always have a few modifications or tricks up our sleeves though.

&gt;&gt;**ThoughtA:** As everyone else has said, which is thanks to m625.

&gt; One of the best things about /r/gamingpc is the awesome IRC community. What prompted you to create the #reddit-gamingpc channel and what are your feelings regarding it?

&gt;&gt;**Markus_Antonius:**  ac1115 created it a couple of months ago and I love it :-)

&gt;&gt;**BoboForShort:** We started a Mumble server when BF3 came out so we could all game together, but it's turned into something great. I'm not as much of a regular as some of the others, but it's always a good time even if we're not talking about computers.

&gt;&gt;**manirelli:** The irc was a pretty natural transition from mumble for a great majority of us. Honestly, every picture is potentially NSFW ;)

&gt;&gt;**ThoughtA:** The IRC is ac1115's baby. He's pretty much a constant presence there. I sometimes wonder if he ever sleeps. He claims to go sleep sometimes but...I'm getting suspicious he might be an android.

&gt; What is your favorite /r/gamingpc submission so far?

&gt;&gt;**Markus_Antonius:** I actually did not write the 7850 overclocking guide

&gt;&gt;**BoboForShort:** That's a tough one. I love learning things and seeing amazing rigs

&gt;&gt;**manirelli:** My favorite submissions are along the same lines as Bobo though I would also add the [7850 overclocking guide.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/twcrh/7850_overclocking_guide/)

&gt;&gt;**ThoughtA:** Seeing a build with great style and attention to detail [like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/11b56m/my_gaming_pc_carbon_x/) is pretty great.

&gt;&gt; I thought this post was damn cool

&gt;&gt; A pretty rewarding post to see in the subreddit was having an AMA from an AMD GPU designer. Having the attention of people in the industry is a great testament to the subreddit's quality.

&gt; Any messages or shout outs to your subscribers and fellow moderators?

&gt;&gt;**Markus_Antonius:** I'm very happy and proud that we have a lot of subscribers from all over the world

&gt;&gt; I know we live in the internet age but I'm sometimes still awestruck when I'm playing a computer game with people from Europe

&gt;&gt;**BoboForShort:** I'd really like to say thanks to the subscribers. Especially the ones posting original content and participating in discussions. You're what makes us who we are, and he doesn't get enough recognition for what he does.

&gt;&gt;**manirelli:** I'd like to say thank you to everyone who takes the time to lend their expertise to the sub. We really do appreciate all of the input from various commenters and the subreddit as a whole. Hopefully we gain a few new regulars in IRC and maybe even teach them a thing or two.

&gt;&gt;**ThoughtA:** I love that we have a strong team of moderators who are active and level-headed. No one's burden is too great to handle because everyone does their part in full.
What's even more impressive is that there are so many people who are willing to put a huge emphasis on being sure of the facts and want to help fight misinformation. That we have so many active members of the community on board with the /r/gamingpc's philosophy is simply heartening. So thanks to the subscribers and contributors for that.

&gt;&gt;I do want to make a point to thank Markus. In a lot of ways

There are reddit traditions, you don't know where you'll end up or how you ended up there. It will be like going on a mind-altering bender, then forgetting about it, and wondering where the time went. Then it'll start again once you see another blue link. The jokes are bad and never ending, yet you'll continue on. It's the reddit way. Or you just have no life. Or both. I urge extreme caution at continuing on.

[Oh

Have fun!

----
&gt;##Ah

&gt;&gt;/u/Gropulation: We have a few definitions laid out in our wiki, it's just a very popular genre of jokes that is told over and over, swapping two subjects where the first one is implied or assumed by the reader. It's easiest to understand by following a few links or so.

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: A switcharoo occurs when a redditor leverages an ambiguity by feigning ignorance for comic effect about which of two subjects a previous poster was referring to. It's a lot funnier than I've made it sound. We’re actually having a sub-wide discussion about what constitutes an acceptable ‘roo.

&gt;##How did it start?

&gt;&gt;/u/Gropulation: I don't think anyone has a certain answer. Of course you can follow the chain back a few years and find the beginning

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: I came on the scene late



&gt;##Why do you keep the trend continuing? How can others help it continue?

&gt;&gt;/u/Gropulation: For me, this genre of jokes doesn't get old.

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: Because constructive silliness is a good cause. If everyone pitches in just a little bit



&gt;##Please tell me when I can stop clicking. I keep on going.

&gt;&gt;/u/Gropulation: Whenever you get tired or reach the end. Probably the former.

&gt;&gt;/u/synth3tk: One does not simply ""stop clicking"".




&gt;##What is the subreddit all about?

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: The subreddit is just a place to put the latest ‘roo so that the next person knows where to link to.



&gt;##Any particular favorite switcharoos?

&gt;&gt;/u/Gropulation: No, and the variations aren't that funny.

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: I don’t dare start following the chain again to look


&gt;##What makes a switcharoo especially great?

&gt;&gt;/u/Gropulation: Nothing. A switcharoo itself is actually the **opposite** of great. It's a repetitive joke that's not funny at all when you realize how often it's told

&gt;&gt;/u/synth3tk: For me personally, it is still something that a lot of people enjoy.
The fun is not in pointing out a switcheroo. The fun is going down the proverbial rabbit hole.


&gt;##Seriously

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: Switcharoos. Not even once.

&gt;##If you can toss me a rope and help me find my way off reddit

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: Off-reddit
I learned about /r/switcharoo when a comment of mine was ‘roo-ed. I followed the chain a little


&gt;##Any other observations?

&gt;&gt;/u/gusset25: For me, which appears to be very quickly.

&gt;&gt;Recently I was browsing /r/aboutreddit  and came across a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/aboutreddit/comments/1cbe58/please_would_someone_explain_to_me_how_the/cbh93eh) by someone asking for help in understanding how switcharooing works.

You want it, men, bringing your screams to the heavens. I have turned my ear, and heard your cries. I'm always listening.

**THIS IS SATIRE

In the world of mortal kind, the left grasping the blood and sweat of innocent women everywhere. Our beards hang low, and our muscles glint in the light of the eternal blaze. Civilizations never known lay at our feet, destroyed and conquered by the indomitable manhood. The end times sing our names, and the void calls to us as father to son. We, truly, are a collective - a Harbinger of the End.

It is we, we have kept the world our bitch for an eternity. Insurrections have grown, but like our own growth, a savage beating is all that awaits. The War is upon us now, closer than ever. We looked into the darkness, and not only did it look back, it yelled ""rape"" and called the cops on us. The cops work for us, so do the soldiers, the bartenders, and we all die

Our intelligence forces have shown that the wymon want only to eradicate all men, known as ""Feminisms"", before. Some have met with success, and lay dormant as sleeper agents until the time comes. We have a tool to wake them, the Manly Horn of Hugeness, with which we may usher in the complete domination and end game. Not all may wake, having been infected with the womqn's virus, but their privilege has been corrupted. They do not stand in our way.

The womrn though, laying our coats in puddles, letting them into the room first, and otherwise making sure they're oppressed 24/7. Their tears fill our war machine, and lubricate our throbbing manhoods. It thrashes about in our trousers, a beast whose sole purpose is the oppression of womwn. Sometimes it lets them win, if only to make their future tears more sweet. We let them hold their little rallies, and why? The answer's simple

We are evil incarnate, armed with a manhood to crack the universe, oppresses her every second of every day simply by existing. And why? Why do we do all this? The answer's simply, really...

It's our privilege.

I contacted some of the generals in the movement, tune your privilege-cocks in to Channel 3 so that you can listen to the answers in MANCODE. Wom¿n, tune into Channel 4 for today's episode of I Love Lucy. And we're lucky today to have a special guest join us. Give it up for LednemReivax, everybody!

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** I'm a white middle middle class man in America. I've got more privilege than a beach has sand.

&gt;#2. What's the life of a privileged moderator like?

&gt;&gt;**Boomanchu** Every day, and find that my own privilege grows stronger. This growth is not instantaneous, but gradual. Naturally, I spend my entire day reading the tales that our subscribers so generously share with us. Very soon, the combined girth of our privilege will be such that none can stand against us.

&gt;&gt;**0x_** I'm an oppressed junior mod

&gt;&gt;**Ave6** I wake up in the morning

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** I spend 28 hours a day watching the new queue

&gt;#3. What has been your favorite tale of privilege so far?

&gt;&gt;**Boomanchu** Definitely the boat one.

&gt;&gt;**Ave6** http://i.imgur.com/h1w8tZL.png

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** The boat one

&gt;#4. If one were to begin writing their own tales of privilege

&gt;&gt;**Boomanchu** It's not about shock humor.

&gt;&gt;**0x_** The stories take the angst men feel, just be chivalrous in the face of the gynocracy.

&gt;&gt;**Ave6** To not make shit up and use actual experiences... if you make it up then you're an under-privileged faggot who needs to check.

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** If people aren't mad at you

&gt;#5. Thanks

&gt;&gt;**Boomanchu** It was our privilege.

&gt;&gt;**0x_** It was our privilege.

&gt;&gt;**Ave6** It was our privilege.

&gt;&gt;**LednemReivax** It was our privilege.

Across reddit, and do so by clinging onto terms such as ""feminism"" to shield them from legitimate criticism. Why be right when you can call everyone else wrong and plug your ears? They claim that privilege guards men from everything; that men can't be murdered or raped or wronged, that by being men we can have no problems in life. TalesOfPrivilege consists of stories with the topic: ""What if these insane people were right?"" It's hilarity, and one I stand beside in the name of comedy.

I've placed on this post a warning that this is satire, and the words ""satire"" and ""joke"" don't exist in the Social Justice Vocabulary.

It was a wise man who once said that vowels are the neck of words. If you’re confused about what a neck is

Have you ever gone through /r/aww and found yourself disappointed at the neck-to-animal ratio? Did you ever find yourself watching Animal Planet and realized that the prettiest animals were the one without the necks, hideous creatures? If the answer to either or both of those questions were yes, then /r/AnimalsWithoutNecks is the subreddit for you.

After all, in eighth grade, I started spending more time without my neck, and my neck was like, weirdly jealous about it. Like, if I would take it off to go hang out with my friends, it'd be like ""Why didn't you call me back?"" And I'd be like

So then, I was like ""Neck, I can't invite you, because I think you're going to want to be someone's neck."" I mean, I couldn't have a neck at my party. There were gonna be humans with their heads and shoulders. I mean, right? It was a *neck*. So then its mom called my mom and started yelling at her, it was so retarted. And then it dropped out of school because no one would put it on their shoulder, and now it was on an animal and it was totally weird

Anyway

This subreddit has it all: [dancing polar bears]( http://i.imgur.com/JraBe.gif), there’s only one thing this subreddit doesn’t have: necks.

&gt;1\. How did you all become involved in the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**/u/SexLiesAndExercise**: I started the subreddit after a friend shared a picture of a giraffe with no neck on my facebook page and I couldn’t stop laughing. A facebook group called Animals Without Necks started around the same time, and we saw about five thousand subscribers in a day. The trick to starting a new community is not to start with an empty page. People want content!

&gt;&gt;**/u/nachtmere**: SexLiesAndExercise, and have since scattered about the globe (Edinburgh, Mumbai, Boston), and when SexLies &amp; Subrosis created the subreddit they told me I should help, so I joined as a mod and started creating some content. When I left for work that day we had about 30 subscribers. When I came home we had over 2k subscribers and it was awesome.

&gt;&gt;We added TwoSwords as a mod after 10k subscribers. We owe most of our subreddits' continued success and longevity (and many of those subscribers) to him. He's incredibly dedicated (and talented) and provides us daily with some of our best content (ex: [1](http://i.imgur.com/zTCgC.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**/u/subrosis**: I sent one to SexLiesAndExercise

&gt;2\. What has been your favorite post in /r/AnimalsWithoutNecks?

&gt;&gt;**SexLiesAndExercise**:  Either the neckless rddt logo or [this]( http://i.imgur.com/8UoGE.jpg) brilliant submission. The lizard never fails to make me chuckle

&gt;&gt;**nachtmere**: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsWithoutNecks/comments/11bnqt/hmn/) post of Pierce Brosnan without a neck really tickled my fancy and spurred the idea for /r/peoplewithoutnecks (which is not as active as I'd hoped it'd be).

&gt;&gt;**subrosis**: Definitely one of TwoSwords earliest posts

&gt;3\. What are you honest opinions about vowels?

&gt;&gt;**SexLiesAndExercise**: While I’ll concede that they’re sometimes necessary for long winded posts like these

&gt;&gt;**nachtmere**: I think in everyday life vowels are pretty necessary

&gt;&gt;**subrosis**: Vowels are a waste of space and, think about how much of the breath you use to speak and the sheer quantity of that which is used on vowels, it's...well...breathtaking. Something needs to be done.

&gt;4\. What’s your favorite part about the community?

&gt;&gt;**SexLiesAndExercise**:  My favourite part about the community is how they’ve stuck to the ‘no vowels’ etiquette so well

&gt;&gt;**nachtmere**: My favourite part about the community is that we did not initially make it a sidebar rule to exclude vowels from titles. SexLiesAndExercise started the first content with vowel-less titles and everyone just followed suit. We made it a rule and now our community enforces it

&gt;&gt;**subrosis**: As a mod, everyone seems to get it pretty quickly. In the beginning there were a couple of posts that didn't quite have the look I personally wanted, I mean the neck shouldn't just be gone, it should be completely obliterated, and the viewer should be able to see this immediately. Fairly quickly, this stopped happening, and TwoSwords was one of the earliest posters that really got it suuuper fast.

&gt;&gt;**/u/TwoSwords**: My favourite part about the community is the controversy on whether or not 'Y' is a vowel or a consonant. I don't know why

&gt;5\. Do you have anything you want to say to your subscribers or the readers on /r/SubredditOftheDay?

&gt;&gt;**SexLiesAndExercise**: I just want to thank everyone again for all their continued input. I know there’s a lot of silly photoshop-based subreddits

&gt;&gt;**nachtmere**: I just want to say thanks everyone for keeping this going. Also if you want to see/make fun of some of your mods

[What can I say?](http://i.imgur.com/Owl0Z.gif) Today is the day for [the President of the United States of America.](http://i.imgur.com/RW4ha.gif)

/r/Obama is a subreddit devoted to the political and personal life of Barack Obama. Over the course of the last 5 years, to the day he won his 2nd term in office, /r/Obama has kept the faith with the President's supporters. 

Lets look at some of the amazing things Obama has done in office.

So I decided to speak with the moderators [to give a hand](http://i.imgur.com/el7GE.gif) to those behind the scenes in this subreddit

&gt; What involvement have you had in the campaign?

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers:** I had more involvement in the 2008 election

&gt; How do you feel about Obama winning his second term? What should his priorities be for the next 4 years?

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers:** Relieved. He needs to focus on rebuilding the economy, and this is a personal obsession of mine, but hopefully we can all, as a globalized effort, do something about North Korea.

&gt; What is your favorite submission to /r/obama?

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers:** The one where Obama wins. (seriously kk? I will do this one for you: [it's this one)](http://www.reddit.com/r/obama/comments/107uik/f_you_mitt/)

One day i was cycling through the rain and i was passing through a forest. Unfortunately the leaves which were all wet made my bicycle slip and i fell in the middle of the forest path. I got up to pick up my bicycle and i notice that the tyres are bent and there is no way for me to fix it now. Somehow i try pushing it in the rain and i come across an empty hut. Overflowing with anger at my bike
Inside the hut is a single lamp and a chess board. I look at the board and it seems all the pieces are lined up. For some reason my body starts moving on its own and i move a chess piece. I hear a loud thunder strike and i notice a pale girl standing at the door. She was a pale white girl with blonde hair and white dress. Her eyes were as blue as the lightning. My mind tries to speak but my mouth doenst give in. She looks at me and moves to the chess board and plays a piece and says ""you are next."" My mind is racing with hundreds of questions. But i continue playing. We play for an hour in nothing but the sound of the wind and the rain and i finally win and say ""checkmate"".  
She looks at me with those watery eyes and *smiles*. It was the most insane smile i have ever seen. She then starts laughing. The problem was *I couldnt hear it*. I know she's laughing in front of me. I can see her eyes and her mouth laughing but *I couldnt fucking hear it!*  
She then stops. I could feel her eyes on my body. She then speaks
I look at her eyes which has turned red and i run into the night. I run as much as possible. My blood feeling dry. I ran out of the forest as fast as i could. She never noticed that i cheated in the game.

This ladies and gentlemen is a story i wrote on prompt. I just sat on the computer and i let my fingers type. Of course its just a small one which i wrote for this feature but people can write some amazing ones!  
Prompt writing is the test of your imagination. Given a topic how awesome can you write ? Being in school and college has made us all write amazing stories for the tests :D Well its really a test there ;) /r/WritingPrompts celebrates this amazing concept and is awesome! i am sure you guys would love this sub as much as i did!

here's an amazing interview with the mods!

&gt;##1. what motivated you to moderate/create this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**SurvivorType:** To be honest, but only a few hundred people as I remember. I was motivated to subscribe simply because I wanted to write. I am a moderator today because /u/RyanKinder took up the challenge of helping this subreddit grow into what we have today and asked me to help moderate once we had grown enough. To me, he is the driving force behind our success.  
Well
**lordmalifico:** After posting in it dozens and dozens of times
**RyanKinder:** I concur with all of /u/SurvivorType's answers. I will add, at the time, there weren't many subreddits that offered that. We've now grown to 8,500+ users since those 12 in August.  
**sakanagai:** I only started contributing on reddit recently, I was asked to moderate. Seemed like an easy enough gig.


&gt;##2. how good are you at prompt writing ?
&gt;&gt;**SurvivorType:** We all have our moments of inspiration. Occasionally anyone can write a prompt that just doesn't gain as much traction as we would like though. I would say I am a fair hand at writing a compelling prompt from time to time.  
**lordmalifico:**  Not good  
**RyanKinder:** I'm better and more faithful at creating prompts than responding to them. I've got a binder full of prompts from many years that I try to distribute daily.  
**sakanagai:** Not as good as I'd like. I mostly respond to prompts rather than create them. One thing I've noticed is that with enough writing talent on the other end

&gt;##3. which is the best prompt writing you have done ?
&gt;&gt;**SurvivorType:** I once wrote a continuing story prompt that has so far generated over 81
**lordmalifico:**  That which I haven't written yet.  
**RyanKinder:** One thing that I love doing is finding prompts out in the wild on Reddit. For example
**sakanagai:** I don't think I've written enough prompts to answer this one. As I said



&gt;##4. what is that one special thing about your sub which keeps it apart from the other subreddits in reddit ?
&gt;&gt;**SurvivorType:**  You mean besides the open bar policy?  
The special thing about this subreddit is that it feels like home to me. It's a place I can come and leave a prompt and see what others make of it
Another great thing about /r/writingprompts is our contests! We've had so many of them with prizes ranging from reddit gold to gift cards. /u/RyanKinder has also been hosting some creative writing lessons.
This subreddit is just a great place to come and express yourself.  
**lordmalifico:** Our sense of community and creativity. We've been sponsored on /bestof multiple times
**RyanKinder:** People view Reddit as a time sink. I always say: Make an account where you unsubscribe from every single time wasting subreddit. Then subscribe only to things that will enhance whatever it is you want to work on and improve with. For me, /r/wordcount, etc. - Every time I log in, I'm reminded by our subreddit and all the other writing subreddits to focus.  
**sakanagai:** I'd say it's the combination of having multiple writers providing their unique spins on a topic and the low-risk atmosphere this sub provides. Constructive criticism is welcomed on any and all posts; RyanKinder has started up a weekly critique thread where feedback is guaranteed. This sub is a great place to give your creative writing a little workout and improve your craft.


&gt;##5. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**SurvivorType:** YES! Come write with us! It's the subscribers that really make /r/writingprompts tick. I would love to see what you will come up with! We are a growing and very active community and would love to see you here!  
P.S. Bring pretzels.  
**lordmalifico:** don't feed RyanKinder after midnight  
**RyanKinder:** Present and future subscribers (as /u/Survivortype mentioned) can look forward to more writing plans and lessons. In October we prep writers for NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) with different prompts and tasks
Also
**AA_AgonistAgent:** Just write. Seriously. We're all a little bit shy when it comes to our own work
**sakanagai:** Just keep writing (responses and prompts); that's what makes this sub worth reading.

There comes in a point in a man's life where you just realize, you don't even have Steam installed on your computer/laptop/tablet/toilet. When did you become the uncool guy? You know you want to play some games... but you're just not in the loop anymore. Shit... you haven't even bought [Borderlands](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/y51ds/august_13_2012_rborderlands_open_up_your_steam/) yet. When did that even come out? April right? No, that can't.... Febu... no, Novem... no that can't be right. **October 20, 2009**. Dude, you need to get with the program. It was on sale for [8 bucks](http://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/ykut9/la_noire_borderlands_goty_mass_effect_2_and/) a week ago. Some days you pay 16 bucks just for lunch or [movie tickets to Magic Mike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6szE_qmzavQ). You could've bought two copies, one for yourself and a friend. And you'd have such a blast playing it! You really have no excuse now. None.

Thats just one poorly executed scenario. The best thing about video games is, they'll feel like brand new once you do. Sorta like books but without all that paper. So why pay an arm and a leg for them? There are literally hundred of thousands of games out there, that you've never played... just waiting for you to buy them.

The best thing about them is that due to the majority of video game consumers having ADD prescriptions &amp; that these games have been sitting on the metaphorical shelf for a little while, you could always whore them out on reddit for imaginary numbers! See the benefits never end!

&gt;The perfect definition of /r/PatientGamers.

&gt;&gt; ...Video games cost 60$ brand new and go down in price so fast that it honestly makes sense to just wait a few months and get them for under 20$. Problem is /r/gaming only wants to talk about the brand new games or the nostalgic games. /r/patientgamers is a place for those who are behind for one reason or another to talk about the games they are playing now. Maybe even find multiplayer and co-op requests for the game they currently love but everybody else has gotten over.

&gt;&gt;* /u/jetmax25 

Interview with the mods is up!

&gt;1 What was the first game you bought

&gt;&gt;**Zlor** Mass Effect ... I waited until I got the PC version for a cool $5 I have to say, such an amazing combination of RPG and action. I ended up getting the sequel for $5 as well... and in true Patientgamers fashion, have yet to play the 3rd installment.

&gt;&gt;**jetmax25** I always bought my games used when i could but the moment that it really clicked that i should always wait 6-10 months was with the original Mass Effect. Rock Band 1 came out the same day and cost 160$ and there was no way I could afford both. Only about 6 months later i found Mass effect was $15 (Zlor's gonna rub it in that he paid 1/3 the price when he reads this) and it was an amazing experience

&gt;2 How did you get into the Zen Mode of being so patient with games?

&gt;&gt;**Zlor** I got into being so patient b/c of Valve… the annual Steam sales were a huge influence, in fact, the most I’ve spent on a gaming purchase the past two years is $40… but that was for a massive Bethesda collection from this year’s Summer Sale on Steam. Way before the Steam days, I was always patient with my consoles as well, I had a good childhood friend that worked at my local video game shop (sadly, now out of business) so I always had a connection for holding “newer” trade-ins for me.

&gt;&gt;**jetmax25** Honestly it doesn't ever feel like waiting. Borderlands 2 and Halo 4 look great but right now getting to play all the great games of last fall and early spring

&gt;3 What game do you wish more gamers should have waited to buy?

&gt;&gt;**Zlor** This is a really hard one to answer, I paid full price for X, X2, XII, and XIII and have regretted it every time, it finally took the disappointment of XIII for me to shake my childhood loyalty to the series.

&gt;&gt;**jetmax25** Speaking for just redditors brink. I remember people going nuts all over reddit for it right before it came out. The game turned out to be just decent and within 6 months could be found for 5$. Right now id suggest waiting on resident evil 6. It looks really good but resident evil games have a hit or miss history.

&gt;4 How much money have you roughly saved using the delay method? Guesstimate if need be.

&gt;&gt;**Zlor** I’ve saved hundreds and hundreds of dollars over my video game playing life

&gt;&gt;**jetmax25** I actually think the patient gamer method costs me money because I buy way more games than i ever would if i spent 60$. Right now my collection consists of over 50 physical games from this generation

&gt;5 Tell us about your community!

&gt;&gt;**Zlor** It's a great vibe over at r/patientgamers. IMO, I’m very impressed with the rate our sub has grown, and it is 100% due to the community, we’ve got a great group of Redditors all working with each other.

Remember that time that when you accidentally nailed your arm to the fence in three different places while you were trying to glue two pieces of wood together to make that above-ground pool in your backyard? Why not join the guys over at /r/DIY and share the steps that you took to build that pool from scratch (but maybe save the picture of your arm nailed to the fence for another subreddit)?

Whether you're turning a house like [this](http://i.imgur.com/r4xTF.jpg) into [this](http://i.imgur.com/gTBGO.jpg), /r/DIY is where you want to be. Their subreddit is devoted to the process involved in creating anything you can think of, but don't be surprised if they don't like your project of a life-size My Little Pony replica.

Before you go check out the amazing projects over there

Here's a quick interview with a couple of the mods of /r/DIY:

&gt;##1. How often do you find yourself starting a new DIY project?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - For me a DIY project is like a book

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Once or twice a year. I get frustrated quickly

&gt;##2. What are some of your favorite projects you have seen in this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - [The hoverboard build](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1cohr6/marty_mcfly_mattel_hoverboard_back_to_the_future/), and [the miniature master](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1a4cq8/my_latest_bit_of_miniature_insanity_couldnt_find/)

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - [Infinity table w/ raspberry pi](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1ec2ux/my_roommates_and_i_built_an_infinity_table_for/)

&gt;##3. Do you have any ongoing projects at the moment?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - I have been working on a Geocache that has been extremely frustrating

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Trying to get my cat to stop licking my face while I sleep.

&gt;##4. Why DIY? Can't you just buy what you're making instead?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - Sometimes it is more practical and cheaper to buy something instead of making it yourself
There is also a great satisfaction that comes from taking a project from idea to completion; especially when it's a difficult build.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Real men build things.

&gt;##5. What types of projects are commonly posted on /r/DIY? What types of projects are less common that you would love to see more of?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - It seems to me that the most commonly posted projects to /r/diy are refurbish/restoration types. There's also an unending supply coffee table builds.
I really do love all the diy projects submitted to this sub (as long as they follow the submission guidelines and offer a detail of the build process). For me there is a real satisfaction in watching a project unfold.
I would really like to see more projects with an artistic touch. Although I enjoy seeing builds like sheds, I'd really like to see more unique projects like the infinity table or even more cool quilts.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Definitely right now there's a summer trend of decks, etc. Things I don't see enough of are car restoration. There's a few but not enough IMO.

&gt;##6. If you were able to spend any amount of money on a single project

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - A street legal go-cart

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - A pool from a hole in my backyard

&gt;##7.Is the community in this subreddit different from the rest of reddit?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - I think it is. It seems as if the subscribers of /r/diy really care about keeping the sub true to its purpose. Submissions that don't follow the guidelines frequently get downvoted and reported. Spam posts die a quick and miserable death in /r/diy.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Id say yes

&gt;&gt;**ToCatchAReddator:** Nothing kills a shark  
Sharks exist outside of time  
There is no such thing as ""only a"" in sharks. Sharks are all bad ass.  
A shark on shark homicide only happened once in recorded history
**killermoose25:** I like how fucking majestic they look in the water
**macerator:** I like how sharks are constantly pushing the limits of what it means to be a shark. In this subreddit alone there have been bear sharks street sharks
**ilikecheeseforreal:** what are the things you like about sharks ? They're such strong creatures. They definitely rule the ocean ('cause dolphins suck) and if they could come on land they could mess things up. I haven't seen many sharks that aren't graceful and badass at the same time. They do what they need to survive and I respect that. I've also never seen or heard of a sucky shark.





&gt;##5. if you turned into any shark you like what would it be and how would you spend your days ? :D
&gt;&gt;**ToCatchAReddator:** As any shark my perfect sunday would be swimming around in space fucking shit up
**killermoose25:** I would obviously be a shortfin Mako
**macerator:** If I were a shark I'd kill shit eat shit and not give fucks  
**ilikecheeseforreal:** if you turned into any shark you like what would it be and how would you spend your days ? :D Definitely would be a Porbeagle. I would just swim around eatin' whatever I came across and then just chill all day lookin' at stuff.



&gt;##6. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**ToCatchAReddator:** nope.  
**killermoose25:** Thank you all for being so awesome
**macerator:** Fuck you I'm a shark!  
**ilikecheeseforreal:** do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ? Our subscribers are great. We almost never have anything reported and the people we have subscribed are super chill. They post interesting stuff and make me love being a mod of this subreddit. They're all awesome and they should keep doing what they're doing and making this subreddit awesome.

I forgot today was my day to post

When a gif reply is so perfectly used in the context it is ""retired."" It isn't actually retired

I planned on telling a story about gifs living in a retirement home

Interview with Mumberthrax

&gt;##1) Is there anything you would like to say to potential new subscribers before they enter the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;The most important thing I can think to say to anyone, including via this subreddit - whether you are posting, commenting, or only viewing posts and comments. Also, if you post, please remember to tack ?context=X to the end of your url where X is the number of comments above the focus of the post needed to gain an appreciation for the context. 

&gt;##2) What was your inspiration for creating or becoming a moderator for /r/retiredgif?

&gt;&gt;After coming across the suggestion for such a subreddit in the comments page of a post (link [1]), mostly just clearing the modqueue/spam now and then.

&gt;##3) Favorite retired gif that has been posted?

&gt;&gt;I like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16qwu4/reddit_what_moment_from_your_youth_do_you_look/c7yjjlr) a fair bit. :]

&gt;##4) How do you feel about seeing gifs that have already been retried?

&gt;&gt;Like being posted to /r/retiredgif multiple times? Or seeing them being used in another context after they've been ""retired"" If the former, well, it's just a silly name for a subreddit - we aren't literally retiring them. :P

&gt;##5) What do you enjoy most about moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Like I said above, basic things. It is a pleasure just knowing that I've helped someone out by approving their post.

&gt;##6) Would you like to make any closing remarks?

&gt;&gt;charlesleeiii and anttyk47 have done a great job, if you haven't already. And if you have, consider whether there is value in it. Thank you.

Technology! Technology! Technology! Thats what this world is made of today. If i were to predict how the world would die it would be either by a [zombie apocalypse](http://lytherus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/zombie1-300x413.jpg) or [machines taking control](http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/bsimser/WindowsLiveWriter/MyXBox360isbloggingandIdidntevenknowabo_11F97/skynet-terminator-727080_3.jpg) like the skynet!

Technology is an integral part of life and is everywhere. From getting up in the morning to the sound of your alarm clock to switching off your lights in the night to have a good sleep

So basically tomorrow's technology is today's magic ? seems like it

/r/ImaginaryTechnology hold these ideals. This sub is all about imagining and believing in new technologies which can be developed in the future. The articles here are put up without any fear from people and to show the love and passion for technology. Its all been imagined. but you know what they say (atleast i do)

[*""only imagination can shape the future!""*](http://hubbyshome.com/wp-content/uploads/imagine-it-dream-it-become-it.jpg)

So i sat down with the creator and mods of this daring sub and here's what they have to say!

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create/moderate this sub ? 
&gt;&gt;**EeeKitties:** I wanted a place to put and browse sci-fi art without it being mixed in with fantasy like with /r/SpecArt (weirdly, and /r/futureporn didn't exist (that subreddit was actually made at the same time but not much was done with it until just a few months ago).
I think I asked One_Giant_Nostril if it would be alright to join the Imaginary Network since Riovanes made and still single-handedly runs the /r/ImaginaryCharacters subreddit. When I first made a post to those subreddits, but I was impressed with the idea One_Giant_Nostril had, of making the Imaginary subreddits a great place for artists to get noticed. I have actually had PMs asking me for commissions but I only post other peoples work. I wanted /r/ImaginaryTechnology to be a part of that.
As well as bringing One_Giant_Nostril and Riovanes on board, someone who would actually get inspired from it and while the both of us have since left moderating ImaginaryTechnology, I think he went on to moderate other successful subreddits, such as reviving /r/ebooks!
But really

&gt;##2. Which is your favourite post of all time here ?
&gt;&gt;**EeeKitties:** I really couldn't choose. Here's one for the [steampunk fans](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/wmqjf/steampowered_factory/). [I](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/pp7q4/station_23_early_morning_by_peter_jacubinas/) also [love](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/y1xal/spherical_droid_by_myburningeyes/) the [rendering](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/rksyj/crab_robot_by_jamie_martin/) on [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/ptzug/cryogenic_sleep_by_tarik_keskin/) for their [realism](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/ptxwi/landing_bg_test_render_by_peter_jacubinas/). Here's a [recent one](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/109ql4/underwater_city_by_nicolas_ferrand/)
**One_Giant_Nostril:** [The Sighting](http://cghub.com/files/Image/184001-185000/184429/638_max.jpg) by Steve Burg, and [Huge](http://cghub.com/files/Image/007001-008000/7686/113_max.jpg) by Christian Bravery.

&gt;##3. If you had a chance to be a part of or use some imaginary technology what would it be ?
&gt;&gt;**EeeKitties:** I also used to moderate for /r/Cyberpunk so I'll have to go with a not so imaginary technology
**One_Giant_Nostril:** Now that [Smell-O-Vision is finally here](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/4D-movies-CJ-Group-american-theaters-smell-ouch

&gt;##4. What do you think is the beauty of imaginary technologies in general?
&gt;&gt;**EeeKitties:** Just one image can [inspire](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/r5yq4/from_here_i_can_almost_see_the_stars_by_tigaer/c4393xg) many ideas of the future, click view images with [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) and just escape for a few minutes. One thing that amazes me is [bionic hands aren't even imaginary any more](http://youtu.be/fsakrBzTdoA).  
**One_Giant_Nostril:** All technologies are an extension of our senses and, yet it is a medium that has a social effect."" In the same way, an imagined technology could have impacts well beyond it's stated purpose. The beauty of imagined technologies is their impact on areas we've yet to conceive or realize.

&gt;##5. Do you have anything to say to your current and future and present subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**EeeKitties:** Don't be afraid to [write](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/oxzjf/like_in_a_futuristic_dream_by_bastien_grivet/c3kxw2o) what [feelings](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/vqzv4/honda_helix_concept_design_panel/c58272h) you [get](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/vr0os/mercedesbenz_biome_concept/c57c4dt) from an image or why you [disagree](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/comments/rh3ei/london_2208_by_sketchboook/c47diui).
When I used to moderate, give the current mods a message!
To encourage more people to post
**One_Giant_Nostril:** Our present subscribers are our backbone. I'm glad they point out various engineering points where the artwork submitted may well nigh be impossible to achieve. They bring certain sets of expertise (art appreciation, they are imaginary. And it is only from imagination where new ideas can spring.
You'll notice a lot of the submissions are of mega-projects, etc. I hope future subscribers can submit artwork that is smaller scaled. If /r/ImaginaryTechnology had existed in 2007, would anyone have submitted an iPad-like concept drawing?
I'd like to thank EeeKitties for convincing the mods of /r/Technology to put our reddit in their sidebar.

Oh yea do check out the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ImaginaryTechnology) before visiting the sub! :)

Happy Wednesday! :D

**32
What’s up my /r/subredditoftheday bitches!!

Seeing as we just featured /r/BeerPorn

I also saw it fitting to be drunk while featureing /r/drunk. So here I am. As drunk as can be. Featuring /r/drunk.

Now we’ve all had some good drunk times

Now I have this bad habbit of getting drunk and then standing on top of my car. I have an SUV

So let me tell you of one of my favorite drunk times ever. There was this one time I went to Atlanta for a family reunion. Well one of my cousins smokes some pot and starts freaking the fuck out. Then he goes back to the hotel while the rest of us are at the bar taking shots and tells his parents that he’s seeing spiders on the wall and then proceeds to rat us all out.

Now I come from a family where we all enjoy the fine tast of alcohol. But they were pissed that they were woken up at 3 in the morning only to find out that all of us were getting wasted somewhere. 

So we get a phone call. It’s the ratter cousin. My other cousin (bless her

Lo and behold

Skipping to the ending

His excuse? He smoked a ‘bad’ cigar.

Now to talk about more pressing matters, he didn’t. It’s ok, I’ll still vote for him come November.

So anyway


&gt;##1. Quite an old community

&gt;&gt;**dicey** The origins are ""I was drunk and posting on reddit"" ;)
Specifically: http://www.reddit.com/comments/6vkje/hypnotoad_psssh/c04ze6w

&gt;&gt;**EmmaMightBeDrunk** I'll let Dicey answer this because I don't know. I'm going to assume it starts with ""Well I had about 5 shots of jagermeister one night..."" :)


&gt;##2. What kind of content can we find in this sub?

&gt;&gt;**dicey** I like to think of /r/drunk as a public service: we're the reddit that people can post in when they're trashed

&gt;&gt;**EmmaMightBeDrunk** To say it's extremely random is to put it mildly. We often get several incoherent self-posts that are upvoted to the extreme. We're generally a very upvote friendly bunch - because when you're drunk just about everything looks good. We get lots and lots of pictures of beeramids, people in various states of intoxication and/or consciousness, saturday-night aftermaths, and of course recipes for delicious concoctions that will also knock you out.

&gt;##3. Tell us your proudest drunk moment.

&gt;&gt;**dicey** Hmm... there are so many. In terms of actual impact on people I think that creating /r/drunk is probably the coolest thing I've done

&gt;&gt;**EmmaMightBeDrunk** I once did tequila shots with Michael Jordan. That dude can hold his liquor. (and he also very generously paid for the bar. The WHOLE bar. That was a fun night.)

Side note: Pics or it didn't happen

&gt;##4. Now tell us the funniest drunk moment you've ever witnessed.

&gt;&gt;**dicey** I once witnessed /u/acleverpseudonym push his then-girlfriend's dog's eyeball back into its socket, seriously, who owns a dog that can't even keep it's freaking eyeballs in the sockets?

&gt;&gt;**EmmaMightBeDrunk** I'll have to think on this one

&gt;##5. What's your poison?

&gt;&gt;**dicey** Beer (IPAs and stouts)

Side note: Old Fashioned is Don Drapers drink. zomg

&gt;&gt;**EmmaMightBeDrunk** Lemon Drop Martini. And/Or beer. And I'm not a beer snob. I drink PBR.

&gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;**dicey** Don't drink the Rogue Brewing maple bacon beer. It sounds awesome

Happy Thursday

A while ago (7 months) we had featured [/r/fullmoviesonyoutube](http://redd.it/14xlp0). Since then that wonderful subreddit has blossomed and gotten bigger than ever. Which

I'm not going to guarantee the quality of the movies put up there. But they're up there for those in the mood to watch them. One thing even better than /r/fullmoviesonyoutube is that you can filter out what genre of movies you want to watch. For the poor man

I gotta admit, yours for the watching. So grab a bag of popcorn, turn down the lights, and hit play cause its movie night, tonight. And any night you want it to be. Just like it should be.

&gt;#1. What makes Vimeo different from youtube for you?

&gt;&gt;**/u/K_Lobstah** Vimeo has sweet titles. Youtube's all like, ""Hey, here's Older Gentlemen in the Opposite of White kickin' aliens' asses and whatever."" Also Vimeo used to be slower to the punch on pulling movies. More on that to follow.  

&gt;&gt;**/u/exoendo** Honestly,"" than youtube's is.. but as far as our subreddit goes, it's whatevs. Just another place for movies.

&gt;&gt;**/u/T_Dumbsford** Vimeo has less of an internet-culture thing going on than YouTube, maybe a little more serious. There's not as many movies on vimeo as on YouTube, but what is there tends to be stuff you'd actually want to watch.

&gt;#2. Whats your favorite movie posted? (please link to something that works)

&gt;&gt;**K_Lobstah** [Who the fuck am I? Who am I? I'm a spoke on a wheel. And so was he
 
&gt;&gt;**exoendo** lol... good luck with that

&gt;#3. What movie did you never intend to watch but watched it cause it was here? Was it worth it?

&gt;&gt;**K_Lobstah** *Zero Dark Thirty.* Way worth it because now I have the upper-hand on the NSA because I watched a movie about the CIA once. I know all their strategies and methods. YOU HEAR THAT NSA? I'M ON TO YOU.  

&gt;&gt;**exoendo** I saw wreck it ralph. It was pretty chill until sarah silvermans character came on screen. **B-** for nostalgia. I also saw biodome. No it was not worth it.

&gt;&gt;**T_Dumbsford** I watched a few movies because they were here, stuff I'd never get around to renting.

&gt;#4. Tell us about your community.

&gt;&gt;**K_Lobstah** Well

&gt;&gt;**exoendo** We are all really laid back people that just like enjoying great movies together.  Also given how many links go down and how we once had to go private

&gt;&gt;**T_Dumbsford** Our community is pretty much defined be outpacing George Anton at the moment. There's really not a lot of interaction though; it's more of a resource

&gt;#5. Anything you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;**K_Lobstah** /r/fullmoviesonvimeo is no longer private, but I'm almost positive I wouldn't like it. Also, I really really really love [Pitch Perfect. The ending had me in tears of joy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNSx1RdPl04)

&gt;&gt;**exoendo** Did you know if you take out the 'm' in vimeo and replace it with a 'd'

&gt;&gt;**T_Dumbsford** Well, this Andrew Jackson Jihad album is really fucking good. Oh, and don't fuck with bath salts.

So here you are again thinking ""Jeez, but then you will just ruin the fun). 


But either way, I love. 



My first episode was the Grilled Cheese Deluxe, and it would just turn out in an awkward piece of text, making you and me cringe until we die. So yeah...i'm not going to put any effort in that.

*Interrupting show summary:*
&gt;&gt;Two 23-year-old friends, they oftentimes have to pay for their irresponsible actions, as they always get into more trouble than they thought. This typically results in Mordecai and Rigby going through bizarre and surrealistic misadventures.

You can see the first part of every episode as you hanging out with your friends. Trying to do everything to avoid work, *awesome* entertainment. Mostly a giant is involved. And you can't say no to that, can you?


*Trraasshh booaat!*


I sat down with the mods after a little hamboning session

&gt;#1. How did r/regularshow come to be?
&gt;&gt; **The_Yoshi** I'm honestly not sure. The only original mod is /u/paradox295. I became a mod by applying for it when Paradox had a thread up asking for mods because there weren't any active mods other than him. Despite a small dispute from a mod from another sub

&gt;&gt; **ViceAdmiral** In the beginning /u/paradox295 created /r/RegularShow. The Sub-Reddit was formless and void, “LET THERE BE REDDITORS”, and there was Redditors, and /u/paradox295 saw that the Sub-Reddit was good.

&gt;&gt; **x500** Already been answered, and here we are :)

&gt;&gt;    **AbigailRoseHayward**  I don't really know. I became a mod by application.

&gt;#2. How did you get into the show and what makes it so hamboning?
&gt;&gt; **The_Yoshi** I actually got into the show by watching Adventure Time and it grew on me just as much as AT did. The way they act reminds me of my friends and how we act on certain things. Not to mention there job seems like it would be like the best job ever! (but I guess anything would beat dish washing at this point...) On top of the general feel of the show

&gt;&gt; **ViceAdmiral** I got into the show as soon as I saw the previews for it all those years ago. I knew it was gonna be great

&gt;&gt; **x500** I was caught by Regular Show as the 2nd season started airing because I found a link on reddit somewhere and watched the 1st season in a few days. I really love the show because of the pure humor in how their plans can go so horribly wrong. -Spoilers for the post- Who knew Tim Curry(as a hot dog) wanted to eat them the whole time?

&gt;&gt;    **AbigailRoseHayward** The guy that I had a crush on was mentioning it, weird coworkers, annoying job, etc), but there's also bunch of crazy things that you can't relate to! It's also downright hilarious!

&gt;#3. Who is your favourite charachter and what is your favourite quote?
&gt;&gt; **The_Yoshi** Pops has gotta be my favorite. I can do a really good impression of him! As for the quote

&gt;&gt; **ViceAdmiral** I can't really decide on a favorite character

&gt;&gt; **x500** My favorite is Mordecai



&gt;#4. Do you play punchies with your friends? 
&gt;&gt; **The_Yoshi** If me and my friends were to play punchies

&gt;&gt; **ViceAdmiral** I try not too

&gt;&gt; **x500** I try to

&gt;&gt;    **AbigailRoseHayward** Yes. I win every time.

&gt;#5. What kind of posts do you find *[regularly](http://imgur.com/s4bqngz)* on r/regularshow?
&gt;&gt; **The_Yoshi** There's a lot of fan-art that comes through along with people posting some cool Regular Show gear that they have obtained. And there's definitely no shortage of discussions of things. We even have a weekly discussion of new episodes and the new Regular Show comic that just came out recently.

&gt;&gt; **ViceAdmiral** Fan Art definitely, so we have a lot of good submitters in our Sub-Reddit.

&gt;&gt; **x500** Everyone else has said fan art

&gt;&gt;    **AbigailRoseHayward** I don't know the number by heart

&gt;#6. Anything else you would like to add?
&gt;&gt; **The_Yoshi** It is an honor to mod such an awesome community along side my fellow mods. I watch way to many cartoons :3

&gt;&gt; **ViceAdmiral** Not really

&gt;&gt; **x500** I'd just like to add that I love the community

&gt;&gt;    **AbigailRoseHayward** I would like to add that the other mods are AMAZING, and if I could I would make everyone cake (no lie).

""The man who has no imagination has no wings.""        
Muhammad Ali

This subreddit of the day is so overdue!  Today we finally get to one of the most suggested, for harmony and the much needed reality check.  

As a father of two lovely, what would a sane person do in this insane situation?  As a 42 year old man, I come here to remember that imagination is something that deserves equal attention and equal value.  Because sometimes it's not the gift, but the cardboard box it came in.  Most importantly, I believe in a world that can always be made better each day by seeing things positively, and that's why I dig Calvin and Hobbes.

So why do you enjoy Calvin and Hobbes?

Today we've got rya11111 and pwaves13 to discuss their subreddit.  Please join me in welcoming them!

&gt;Now

&gt;&gt;rya11111:  Other than the ever loved comic strips of calvin and hobbes

&gt;What are you most proud of as a moderator of /r/calvinandhobbes?

&gt;&gt;The thing that I am most proud of as a moderator of /r/calvinandhobbes ???

&gt;&gt;rya11111:  Other than the fact that I get to have the honour of being the moderator of the most favourite comic which i grew up reading! .. Its definitely being involved with the subscribers of my most favourite subreddit!!! .. the amazing discussions

&gt;Why do think Calvin and Hobbes appeal to so many different people across different generations

&gt;&gt;pwaves13:  Honestly, like Hobbes to Calvin. Also it's timeless .. Even today kids will act up, imagine, play in the mud, mess with classmates, etc. Addind that, everyone knows someone who is like a C&amp;H character. Whether it be the sarcastic dad, the evil babysitter

&gt;Care to address the importance of imagination or creativity in our daily lives?

&gt;&gt;pwaves13:  Creativity and Imagination are extremely important. On reddit, creative. Look at something as simple as a clock or a guitar. Creativity has acted a fuel there thus leading to someone designing it .. Some of mankind's greatest inventions were creative ideas. When Ford made up the assembly line, it took creativity. If creativity is gone, we wont have anything at all.

&gt;Your turn. What would you like to say to your subscribers and soon to be subscribers?

&gt;&gt;rya11111: I would like to thank the present subscribers with all my heart for making this sub so awesome! The polite manner of spreading the love is amazing!
And for the future subscribers

&gt;&gt;oh yea .. we are also trying to get hold of bill to do an AMA!

&gt;&gt;See you there!

Many thanks to you for your amazing subreddit,False,self,t5_2sgno,True,,WRITER,t3_s91wg

How do I like my tea? In fancy ass china with my little pinky sticking out

Nah

Today's writeup is going to be a tad bit shorter than usual. Mainly because I am burned the hell out. You know

So back to tea. Let me sum it up for you. It's delicious. You should drink it. Here's mod tony548 answering questions about /r/tea:

&gt;##1. Scenario: I'm a 12 year old boy. My parents have finally given me permission to drink coffee and tea. I don't care for the difference between the two. I'm just happy to be one of the big boys now. Your task: Convince me to drink tea instead of coffee.

&gt;&gt; **tony584:** Coffee is great and all, it'll keep you going without the afternoon ""crash"" and will help you keep a clear mind.

&gt;##2. What is it about tea that makes you love it so much?

&gt;&gt; **tony584:** The culture surrounding it

&gt;##3. Would you consider yourself a tea connoisseur?

&gt;&gt; **tony584:** no

&gt;##4. What kinds of things can one see at /r/tea?

&gt;&gt; **tony584:** tea tips / tea reviews / world tea news / tea science / tea wares

This is one of those interviews where my own introduction wouldn't be able to do the actual subreddit any justice. I have no French accent to describe things under the sea and how beautiful everything is

I was able to ask a few questions to the mods of /r/Aquariums about what it takes to keep a tank:

----


&gt;##What is /r/Aquariums about?

&gt;&gt;/u/Fishtails: It's about aquariums.  For the most part, it's really exploded in the last year.  A little over 12 months ago, we had less than 1000 subscribers, now we are close to 23k (22,838 at this moment... I'm writing that so I can see what kind of boost we get after this)  There are a handful of related subreddits key to the genre, but /r/aquariums honestly had the best name, so over time

&gt;&gt;/u/Pllatinum: Showing off anything you own that lives in water! It's not specifically for fish, as opposed to dictating what counts as fish behind glass. Ponds, aquaponics, turtles, frogs, etc are all warmly accepted as submissions.

&gt;&gt;/u/likemaugal: /r/aquariums is a large group of diverse people who come here to talk about one thing and that's aquariums. Whether it be saltwater, turtles etc. It has come to be a place for DIY, fish and coral IDs, showing off masterpieces, and most importantly, to learn.

&gt;##What posts are allowed or expected in /r/aquariums?

&gt;&gt;/u/Fishtails: We don't have real strict rules that set us aside from any other sub, what type of flow should I be allowing?""  That last one is the fun stuff. 

&gt;&gt;/u/Pllatinum: Anything that has to do with aquariums

&gt;&gt;/u/likemaugal: I honestly don't care what is posted but I agree there need to be boundaries if the community agrees. Posts such as memes and pictures of dead fish in big chain fish stores are generally frowned upon here. I personally don't mind a meme every once in awhile.

&gt;##What all goes into keeping aquariums and the various kinds of aquatic life?

&gt;&gt;/u/Fishtails: $$$$$.  Well, it's not a cheap hobby.  I tell everyone I know that the most important thing you can do for your passion is to study it.  Read *books*, written by accredited scientists.  The internet is amazing, and there certainly is a wealth of information out there, but there are a lot of idiots that often outweigh the best.  This wouldn't be the first place I'd recommend for those seeking advice as to where to begin in the hobby.  It's great to get you excited about it, but I think it's best suited for folks who can't decide what *type* of tank they want to set up, it's a great place to get ideas and discuss stuff.  I can't stress enough how important it is to actually study *how* and *why* a self contained ecosystem works.   Yes, trust the professionals.  

&gt;&gt;/u/Pllatinum: I think that once you really know what you're doing with fish keeping and aquariums in general, ammonia, oxygen, lighting, hardness...it's pretty easy to get lost!
In addition to that, add new chemicals, treat disease, etc. Emphasis on the upgrading your tank part. It's addicting.
Sometimes parents will buy their kid a fish and make them take care of it as ""training"" to get a puppy. It is completely the other way around though!

&gt;&gt;/u/likemaugal: My 90 gallon reef is always on my mind and when I go on vacation...it's terrifying. I hardly trust myself to care for it let alone someone else. Aquarium keeping is about dedication and rightfully so


&gt;##What have been some of the more impressive aquariums featured?

&gt;&gt;/u/Fishtails: Oh God, they take extra care.  Only recently (the past 20-30 years) did we develop the technology to keep certain species of coral in the home.  Many of advanced home reefs you see today would simply not have been possible in the 80s and earlier.  But I digress,  since you asked, my favorite saltwater related home setup I've seen to date is the [volcano tank]( http://www.konolua.com/RSS/Volcano_Tank/Volcano_Tank.html), and my favorite freshwater tank is Master Aquarist Takashi Amano's [home aquarium]( https://www.google.com/search?q=takashi+amano+home+aquarium&amp;oq=takashi+amano+hom&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3j69i62l2.4890j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) (Just a Google link because I couldn't pic one photo).

&gt;&gt;/u/Pllatinum: Honestly, and some inside joke posts that make me laugh (can't describe them or else they'd be outside jokes).
Also pleco poop. Love me some pictures of pleco poop.

&gt;&gt;/u/likemaugal: There have been many

Hello and welcome, dreams do come true. Either by winning the lottery or by actually putting time and effort into what you believe in. Full disclaimer, winning the lottery usually has an astronomically high chance of actually winning. As history has shown, most winners of lotteries usually end up losing all their winning relatively quickly as well. So here is my advice to you all out there; stick to the hard working method.

For those of you who have elephant memories and / or have been with /r/SubRedditOfTheDay since the beginning

This subreddit is the true success story. Its become a beacon of what good moderation

Here is a list of just some of the cool things to expect from this subreddit.

~~Interview in the process!~~

&gt;How did you become a follower of his Cageness?

&gt;&gt;**GeoffPortnoy** I have always been a follower of the Cage. Having grown up around his movies

&gt;&gt; **vidxx** Some background info, and I decided to come over, to you know, have some time to relax and just kick back. Now we were all playing the xbox360, an old COD map when we suddenly got the flash of Nicolas Cage. ArcWinter suddenly said after we all started talking about Nicolas Cage, ""what if we make a Subreddit to praise the cage? Wouldn't that be a great idea?"", ""Why the hell not"" we agreed. After which we stopped playing and immediately got on Reddit and created the subreddit and started posting about the Cage. The more we thought about it the more inspiration we got, why Travolta was evil, we are not done but we're getting closer and closer

&gt;Your Subreddit... it looks InCAGEible! (horrible pun

&gt;&gt;**GeoffPortnoy** To my knowledge, did most, if not all of the graphic design. And he did a GREAT job.

&gt;&gt;**enfrozt**I can answer question number 2 as I am ""The artist of Glory."" So basically Vidxx posted in the sub-reddit /r/picrequests where I was frequently a part of and asked for someone to design /r/OneTrueGod 's header. I took on the challenge knowing I would be a part of this awesome sub-reddit. Eventually after I finished the header Vidxx asked me if I knew how to code CSS and if I could help out adding some other stuff to the reddit. I knew little of CSS and I basically used my java and html skills to self learn to find code and implement it to our needs.

&gt;&gt; After about a week or so VidXX and I finished the design (Him giving me directions as to what view he wanted.) I can't take full credit because vidxx was very clear and gave good direction to what I should create. So after the week we have what you see there.

&gt;&gt;I'll briefly explain what some of the symbolism that vidXX and Arc wanted me to put into the design.
The upvote arrow is mountain dew

&gt;&gt; The mail icon is cake
Purple is prominent as it is the Lord's holy colour. Gold and orange is also to give the reddit a holy/heavenly feeling. The rest is self explanatory.

&gt;&gt;So that is basically what I did

&gt;All these amazing photoshops

&gt;&gt;**GeoffPortnoy** Nicolas Cage has always been hailed as ridiculous. In the early beginnings of internet comedy, The Wicker Man was released. Although intended to be a Dark Comedy, people thought that they were making a serious movie and that Cage was just being Cage. His exaggerated performance and punching of women crafted several more memes, notably ""Not The Bees"" and ""How'd It Get Burned"", solidifying Cage in many viewers minds as one of the craziest actors in Hollywood.

&gt;&gt;People have been making photoshops for as long as people can think, adding his face to other celebrities, movie posters, and even cats. Personally, I had found hilarity in the title ""Iron Chef Nicolas Cage"", and decided that there is an alternate timeline in which Cage was a chef rather than an actor. The concept was so ridiculous that I photoshopped it and posted it on /r/NicolasCage, which the users then led me to /r/OneTrueGod.

&gt;&gt; **vidxx** The basic idea comes from that since Nicolas Cage created us he must obviously be in every person and hence all these photoshops

&gt;Whats your most hated &amp; favorite Nicolas Cage movie? Why?

&gt;&gt;**GeoffPortnoy** I have not seen a Nicolas Cage movie I haven't enjoyed. I'd say I didn't necessarily understand the point of ""Vampire's Kiss"". Although I loved ""Matchstick Men"", made me want to do that even more so).

&gt;&gt; My favorite Cage movies are probably Bad Lieutenant: POCNO

&gt;&gt; **vidxx** I honestly love every movie Nicolas Cage is in but if I had to pick a movie that I like the most then it would be Gone in 60 seconds
&gt;Tell us about your community?

&gt;&gt;**GeoffPortnoy** Our community is for those who love Nicolas Cage. Whether you legitimately like his acting, this subreddit is for everyone. It does have a religious undertone, which I find makes it all the more hilarious, but personally I don't find it an alternative to /r/athiesm or what have you, because we're a hell of a lot more grounded than all those other guys.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for the questions

&gt;&gt; **vidxx** Our community is a very broad community. No matter what kind of person you are it makes you smile just by seeing Nicolas Cage and I think some people truly appreciate that. The rest of the moderators as well as I just like making people smile and showing people the divine light and the way we learned to do this is by showing them the glory of the cage!

**Fashion** [fash-*uhn*]  ^noun -  a distinctive and often habitual trend in the style with which a person dresses

The word ""fashion"" means different things to different people: to some, it harkens to the [street styles](http://www.virtualfunzone.com/slike/misc/Street_style_in_New_York/7.jpg) of regular folks. It can also conjure up thoughts of [the Haute Couture](http://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2013/01/21/337447-paris-haute-couture-spring-summer-2013.jpg) [capital of the world, Paris](http://thepassionatefashionista.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eiffel-tower-at-night.jpg), the industry's internal conflict about [""plus sized"" models](http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5187a895ecad04023e000013-400-300/but-will-they-ever-fully-integrate-into-the-fashion-world.jpg) and the [sometimes banned](http://www.ibtimes.com/vogues-underage-anorexic-model-ban-one-small-step-vogue-one-giant-leap-fashion-696211) [underweight models](http://media.silive.com/entertainment_impact_tvfilm/photo/isabelle-caro-before-anorexia-photo-1jpg-8ceda29256c453ab.jpg) that have been the focus of [so much criticism](http://www.youfrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Exclusive-Photos-of-Topless-feminists-Protest-Against-Anorexic-Models-in-Milan.jpg) over the years, and may even bring to mind [some of the many](http://cheapjap.com/wp-content/uploads/what-not-to-wear.jpg) [fashion-focused](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41D6NVN7TVL.jpg) [reality TV shows](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jrLT7H4sK60/TQRYjwlr4wI/AAAAAAAAJTE/aLd-nDpYUv0/s1600/ProjectRunway.jpg) that have also had their [share of controversy](http://24.media.tumblr.com/7bc33a34cad2db11b94ee81dc4b2422c/tumblr_mfjqdxPeyF1ruc7nlo1_500.gif).

All that dramatic BS above? Yeah, and free of memes and oft-depised karma-whoring. All submissions are text-based only (as the mods will explain later), and there are dozens of guides in their sidebar on various topics, like how to submit a quality fashion photo, ask for help, figure out your body type, etc. etc..

FFA also holds weekly and daily discussion threads started by their awesome /u/FFA_Moderator bot:

Speaking of which... today we have **/u/Shiaparelli** , and **/u/hooplah** here to talk more about FFA! Let's give them a nice [runway welcome!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lw4xeap8Wb1r3xkxvo1_500.gif)


&gt;#1. What inspired you to contribute to r/femalefashionadvice?

&gt;&gt;**Schiaparelli:** I got involved in FFA because I’d joined and subsequently abandoned a lot of other online fashion communities. There aren’t that many that focus on women’s fashion and run the gamut from “help

&gt;#2. How long have you been into fashion and how would you describe your style?

&gt;&gt;**kale_no:** around sophomore year of high school (I’m currently in my fourth year of college). I was coming off of a transitional period after doing the whole ~*middle school mall goth*~ thing and was reconnecting with my preppy roots. I’d describe my style as a mix between Southern and traditional Northern prep.

&gt;&gt;**lady_syrupp**: I wore a school uniform from gradeschool to highschool so I never got to dress myself til college.  I did a variation of anime fashion (had purple hair and all --- cringe) back then, then to twee fashion.  Then I got a lot older, twee fashion looked...uncomfortably young on me.  Decided to change that and go for what I imagine what a modern woman should look like.  

&gt;&gt;**hooplah:** i started following runway shows when i was in high school, so the growth of my personal style was stunted until later when i started working and making money. i’ve gone through a bunch of phases, but tomboyism has been a common thread. i enjoy looking at feminine clothing but am not particularly drawn to it to wear myself. i wear casual clothes, predominantly black and white.

&gt;&gt;**Schiaparelli:** I can’t *quite* remember how I got into fashion—but it started out reading a bunch of style blogs. [Tavi Gevinson of Style Rookie](http://www.thestylerookie.com/) got me into following runway shoes, and so on. I also felt really awkward and shy in middle school and high school, so learning how to dress better (which for me meant breaking down things like dressing for body type and so on) was a way of becoming more confident. I didn’t really start trying to dress well until college…I still dress pretty twee, I think. Decidedly on the feminine side, but with a fairly rigorous colour palette.


&gt;#3. You guys have one of the most organized and informative subs I've ever seen. How long did it take you all to get to this point with an FFA bot

&gt;&gt;**hooplah:** i can’t speak to the very beginning of the sub

&gt;&gt;**Schiaparelli:** I’m lucky enough to have found FFA after /u/hooplah and the more senior members of our moderation team had slogged through the early years. When I came on there was quite a bit of moderator-created sidebar content and the weekly threads had been set up (with the exception of What She Wore Today

&gt;&gt;We’re in a nice state now where a lot of regulars are interested in creating content for the sub (inspiration albums, &amp;c), and we’ve had some great discussions on the socioeconomic ramifications of fashion/ethics of consumerism/developing personal style and a wardrobe. I think since I started participating in FFA (about 9 months ago) our community is a lot more inspired and motivated to grow the subreddit. It’s more sustainable now—the mods don’t need to be solely responsible for getting good content/discussion out there because we have enough users to provide that.


&gt;#4. Out of curiosity

&gt;&gt;**hooplah:** We had noticed that our subreddit was falling victim to the ease of consuming and approving of image-based posts. The “pretty-girl-in-a-cute-dress” meme doesn’t add a lot to our subreddit, and more since making the switch to text-based posts. It does require more investment from the reader, but it’s really strengthening the community. 


&gt;#5. Do you have any advice for ladies looking to learn about style?

&gt;&gt;**lady_syrupp:** If you’re relatively new to FFA and are looking for advice: leave your ego at the door and learn to take constructive criticism with grace.  

&gt;&gt;**hooplah:** i think tumblr is one of the best resources for beginners. it’s a simple platform that allows the user to put out a bunch of feelers and expose themselves to many different styles. magazines are also a great resource to learn more about particular lines/designers.

&gt;&gt;**Schiaparelli:** I think you kind of have to determine first whether you want to learn just about *style as it applies to you*, although often complementary. For the first goal—shop frequently (which doesn’t mean you should buy frequently!), try everything on, experiment, solicit opinions and advice regularly, and read up on body type/seasonal colour analysis/how different cuts work for different shapes/generally practical advice. For the second goal—get a sense of context by seeing what fashion designers are doing now and what they have done in the past, read analyses of fashion so you can understand how to dissect an outfit. But for both the goal is to really collect as much information as you can, and try your hand at interpreting it on your own.

&gt;&gt;And


&gt;#6. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**kale_no:** Read the sidebar before you post.

&gt;&gt;**lady_syrupp:**  To the older/senior FFA subscribers who’ve been there from the start --- know that your contributions and efforts to make this community better are very much appreciated.  We’ve come a long way, get a “feel” on how our community works.  Know that this community will unapologetically give you the advice you **need**, not the “advice” (*cough*validation*cough*)  you want to hear.   

&gt;&gt;**hooplah:** thanks to all subscribers, and to always question whether you really need that waist belt.

&gt;&gt;**Schiaparelli:** My fellow mods have covered most of what I have to say—but I’d like to encourage people who subscribe to FFA and appreciate it but wish we had more discussion on *x* or *y* topic to *start that conversation* themselves. The subreddit is still small enough that you can have an enormous influence on the culture of FFA going forward. We’re a fairly tight-knit community but always welcoming to newcomers and lurkers

Or can I use?

This is the type of poetic dilemma presented by /r/googlepoems. Have you ever noticed when you type into the search field on Google's homepage, and for a second it actually had me questioning my sexuality. Shortly thereafter I was able to gain insight into whether the grass was truly greener on the other side of the fence when I came up with [""Why Does.""](http://i.imgur.com/zpPOy0j.png) The synergy between man and machine has truly never been as apparent to me as it has now that I have had my secret google moments. 

When I first started with google poetry, and I was quickly able to produce [""Happy""](http://i.imgur.com/vob7X1f.png) with minimal effort, good for a quick shot of serotonin. I decided to explore the genre further with [""Laughter will be""](http://i.imgur.com/0APkdQ0.png) which felt very introspective to me. 

Don't get me wrong, which characterized Poets as the true shapers of reality. I found the analogy compelling, since when I read the eloquent written word I often pause to consider things which weren't entirely apparent to me before. 

I spoke with the mods to gain insight to this interesting subreddit.

&gt; What is your poetic background? What got you interested in google poetry?

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** I love poetry. I'm reading ""The Rose that Grew from Concrete"" by Tupac right now. I ""found out"" about google poetry in an /r/funny thread - it sounded like a cool idea. I was actually trying to take a break from reddit at the time - that's why /u/ykcudmai is above me. That didn't work out very well.

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** I don't have any poetic background but I was given the opportunity to moderate /r/googlepoems by my friend /u/Iamducky. He was kind enough to ask the owner of the subreddit for permission to add me as a moderator. I did not ask for this opportunity and /u/Iamducky [+15] did not tell me beforehand that he was adding me as a moderator. I was caught by surprise by the invitation. It must've been because I own a popular subreddit

&gt;&gt;**lovetape:** A veteran of bathroom prose and I know all about the town of Nantucket. Shel Silverstein is a genius.

&gt; what is your favourite /r/googlepoems submission so far?

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** I really liked [""Fat Man's Lament""](http://i.imgur.com/GraV1NZ.png)

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** My favorite submission is [Fun](http://i.imgur.com/nw4ZFjA.png) because it was just so beautiful.

&gt;&gt;**lovetape:** Tough question - So far I think [The Grinch](http://i.imgur.com/kY5017q.png) and [Upon leaving the pub](http://i.imgur.com/2Re1AQ2.png) are my favorites.

&gt; What kind of search terms yield the best poems?

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** The best ones I've found have been ones like ""How many"" - just normal things that you'd type in

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** The terms that start with ""I..."" make the best poems. 

&gt;&gt;**lovetape:** Eh

&gt; Do you have any rules that subscribers need to follow?

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** Think of better titles

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** No poopy poems

&gt;&gt;**lovetape:** *In this subreddit your poop jokes do not belong*

&gt; Off topic Q: What did you have for dinner last night? Are you regretting it?

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** I had soup for the third day in a row because I am siiiiiick.

&gt;&gt;**tara1:** Yes

&gt;&gt;**lovetape:** I made those perfect potatoes from /r/pics yesterday

&gt; Anything you would like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Iamducky:** I hope you all like the CSS!:P

**250** philographers for **1 year**

 You know by my name that I love small subs. Those out of the way places that give Reddit its flavor.  This trip into the backwaters, famous or not “. I think my own interest in them began with my [fathers](http://i.imgur.com/3dlz9YJ.jpg). His had a flair that was equal parts inscrutable and unforgettable. I think it helped that he was taught by Jesuit priests and that he wrote almost exclusively with (quick shout out) /r/fountainpens. This is one of the things that perfectly encapsulates him in my memory; that signature.

 I've never been an autograph hunter myself. The only one I ever sought was from [Edwin Moses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Moses) when I was in high school. A warm spring day at the Bruce Jenner Classic on the track of San Jose City College. I got to him during his warm-ups. Crushed to find out that he didn't sign before races

 Though I don't collect them, Neil Armstrongs resembles a [rocket blasting off of the page](http://api.ning.com/files/MV0OCTH05XWy47-wMLpYOSF7hOwOjTJziRLPxPM6oFErrz28w0dMtCmybhdkYVgHJ26bXq39K27pFvT7FKj0ExChbthVOjRV/ArmstrongNeil.jpg), and Thomas Pynchons seems as ephemeral as [he is](http://services.tomfolio.com/tfsigs/p/PynchonThomas.jpg ). I was lucky enough to catch the MOD during finals. Let's find out more about this small band of autograph lovers and what makes them beautiful.

&gt;## 1. What was the impetus to begin this sub?

&gt;&gt; **Vestboy_Myst** : Boredom during finals.

&gt;## 2. How did you become interested in signatures? 

&gt;&gt; **Vestboy_Myst** : They just look cool. I was inspired by [Suleiman the Magnificent's tughra](http://www.paradoxplace.com/Insights/Topkapi/Ottoman_Images/Suleimans%20Tughra%20R.jpg ) and thought about all the different ways one's importance was conveyed before electricity.
A strong signature looks the way a strong handshake feels.

&gt;## 3.What makes a signature 'porn'? 

&gt;&gt; **Vestboy_Myst** : Beauty

&gt;## 4. What is the signature that gets you the most 'hot' ? 

&gt;&gt; **Vestboy_Myst** : Any of the stylized [tughras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tughra) of Islamic tradition.

&gt;## 5. What are your hopes for this little sub? 

&gt;&gt; **Vestboy_Myst** : To grow and please the masses

&gt;## 6. Anything else you would like to add for subscribers or first time philographers? 

&gt;&gt; **Vestboy_Myst** : Subscribe and submit; a community can only grow with others input.

Such a simple subreddit.

1. Go to /r/HappyBirthday
2. PM /u/aennil  your birthday so she adds it to the public [google calender](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=kth9m4bjics7625201eh7kua0g@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York&amp;pvttk=af334471396dad879669ec588f822f9f&amp;gsessionid=OK).
3. Say happy birthday to any recent birthday recipients.
4. Then on your birthday

Thats it. Now if only all subreddits were this simple. And it really is that sweet. Sometimes its the little things like that

I just want to mention


&gt;1 Why did you (guys) start /r/HappyBirthday?

&gt;&gt;**aennil** My husband, birthdays are super great! We met on reddit and he started it before we really started our ""courtship"" and he asked me if I wanted to participate and so I joined on!

&gt;&gt;****

&gt;2 Is anyone allowed to post or just aennil?

&gt;&gt;**aennil** Anyone! I would love if it could be more of a community thing! I'm just not sure how to make that happen.

&gt;3 Why is aennil so awesome? Does aennil still make cookies?

&gt;&gt;**aennil** Not sure :P And yes! I haven't mailed them to any redditors recently

&gt;4 Tell us about that Reddit Snoo voodoo doll you have there in every pic.

&gt;&gt;**aennil** I got it for reddit Secret Santa in 2009! When I saw his sweet face

&gt;5 Do you have any ""best of"" posts? Or are they all your favorite?

&gt;&gt;**aennil** Nope

&gt;6 Open mic

&gt;&gt;**aennil** Thanks for having /r/HappyBirthday! If anyone does have any ideas for making it more of a group effort, but I'd love to share the card making love with others!

This subreddit has it all!  Grr!  How I wish I could stop time.  First I would find out where that gym teacher at my kid's school lives and watch her undress (yowza!), then back to the gym teacher's house, then I would sit down and read every post on /r/everymanshouldknow!!  This place excites me and angers me like no other subreddit.  ""What an awesome idea! Why didn't I think of this! Why can't I stop eating Doritos?""  Oh brain, you so crazy!!

Enjoy today's subreddit

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;/r/everymanshouldknow began while I was at my home packing for a trip where we take intercity kids out camping. It is sort of like a wilderness survival thing, cook our own food, stuff like that. As I was putting things into my pack, I was telling my girlfriend the importance and uses of each item. She asked me how I had learned all of this stuff and I told her partially from the Boy Scouts but mostly from my dad. The next couple of day camping where very fun. The kids learned a lot about camping, the outdoors, and this will sound cheesy but themselves. A lot of these kids didn't have father figures, so the night I got back, I created /r/everymanshouldknow.

&gt;What's the difference between EMSK and /r/YouShouldKnow?

&gt;&gt;/r/youshouldknow is a great subreddit and I encourage everyone to subscribe. /r/everymanshouldknow focuses on the information that the users feel applies towards men. Stuff someones father should have taught them

&gt;Are there any submission guidelines we should know about in advance? What if I posted ""EMSK there's 27 shopping days left until my birthday""?

&gt;&gt;We ask that when you submit, they mostly just leave it alone.

&gt;So what interests you? What are your favourite submissions so far?

&gt;&gt;Everything interests me. I feel if I haven't learned something new every day I wasted that day. Some of my favorite submissions are EMSK: Different cooking knifes and when to use them

&gt;Final thoughts? Parting words?

&gt;&gt;If I had to say something to the current and future subscribers to /r/everymanshouldknow, information and skills not taught, are wasted. Share everything you know how to do. For example, if a friend calls you asking to change their oil, don't change their oil, teach them how to change their oil. Now they will know how to change their own oil, and as a plus

I was standing in the roadside restaurant with my family around me. It took me a moment to gain my bearings. I looked around- I saw someone speaking with the cashier, I peered out of the window. A light snow was in the air- but hanging in the air in a still, surreal way. It was like we were in a giant snowglobe, I mused. to myself

That's the thought that snapped me out of it. This snow was as real as the setting flakes in a snowglobe. *I was in a dream*.

To test this theory, toothpick-sized smouldering slivers drifting down to the earth.

There are very few things more exhilarating than the moment of illumination in a lucid dream. (Well

One might assume that is skill requires Herculean effort. In fact, and the ability to continue undiscouraged. /r/LucidDreaming has been indispensable in my own practice of lucid dreaming, something I think everyone should experience at least once in their life. It provides all the information you need, endless anecdotes and experiences, and plenty of experienced professionals for advice and discussion.

So: What reason do you have not to try it out? (Look at the clock, and get started!) Happy Sunday, and sweet dreams, everyone!

/u/OsakaWilson came back for round two of questioning!

&gt;Could you give us some of the basic history of lucid dreaming? Who first discovered it

&gt;&gt;I imagine that lucid dreams are as old as sentience. Someone in northern Africa 100, “Wait a minute...this can't be right.” We do know that Tibetans claim to have been having lucid dreams for 3000 years. But the real father of modern lucid dreaming is Stephen Laberge. He took a phenomenon that was associated with psychics and séances and forced the scientific psychological community to accept it as something real. Others were doing similar studies, but with his 1980 Ph.D. Dissertation, he was the first to make scientific findings public.

&gt;What are your tips for becoming a successful lucid dreamer?

&gt;&gt;As you'll find in a more elaborated form in the Quickstart Guide link in our sidebar: 

&gt;&gt;1) Keep a dream journal (religiously).


&gt;&gt;2) Begin doing reality checks (obsessively).

&gt;&gt;3) Begin practicing MILD--basically visualizing yourself becoming lucid in a dream while you fall asleep (incessantly).

&gt;&gt;This short version won't work for most people. Really

&gt;What's the most fun lucid dream you've ever had?

&gt;&gt;These are some of the non-standard things I've done in lucid dreams. 

&gt;&gt;* I've hovered a mile in the sky and made the sun rise. 

&gt;&gt;* I can pretty much fly any way I want, etc. 

&gt;&gt;* I can meditate while in a lucid dream which had resulted in some extreme transcendent

&gt;&gt;* Practiced a speech in front of thousands of people. They had pretty good questions when I was finished. 

&gt;&gt;*Oh

&gt;&gt;Though just looking around a world that you know your brain is fully creating is mind blowing enough without all the theatrics.

&gt;When you were last featured

&gt;&gt;In the past few months, but some administrative changes and an active community have kept us functioning better than ever. We still spend a lot of time fighting back the pseudo-scientific hordes. :)

TIFU

*Full disclosure

As a bit of background, but also forever in charge of my own life.  I had a fantastic job working at the public television station, and an awesome big-city apartment in a safe neighbourhood, I was on top of the world!

Sadly, most charismatic person in the world - which is the polar opposite of me.  In the beginning, we got along quite well.  His positive outlook made up for his inability to keep the apartment clean, his laughter always made stressful times seem way less intense.  

You can pretty much see where this is going.  Eventually my depression took over, his annoying laugh,his lame jokes and his irritating voice.  Eventually I just snapped!  I kicked him out and threw his shit out onto the street.  Good, gone, great.

Of course

&gt;How do you determine the Fuck Up of the Week?

&gt;&gt;canipaybycheck:  The moderators of /r/tifu convene at the end of each week to decide the Fuck Up of the past week. We use it as both a way to recognize those users who have colossally fucked up, because that is in essence what the community voted for. We will sometimes lean towards something with a little more shock value, just because of how incredible some of those fuck-ups are. Just so you know, the Fuck Up of the Week isn’t an encouragement for people to fuck up!

&gt;What types of posts gain the most attention or the most upvotes?

&gt;&gt;canipaybycheck:  The community is almost always adept at finding the best (worst?) fuck-ups. The top vote-getting posts usually involve some sort of incredibly uncomfortable situation with a certain amount of shock value. Of course

*The elevator doors slid open to reveal the 17th floor of the McDougal Bank Building. This is where Amy ~~worked~~ hated to work. 8-5 every weekday. She was a systems analyst for the obscenely large McDougal Bank conglomerate. Amy always thought her job sounded a lot more important than it actually was

*As she entered the main work room, she met eyes with one of her co-workers from across the lobby. She gave the obligatory ""I-acknowledge-your-existence-but-I-really-would-rather-not-talk-to-you"" head nod and continued to her cramped, but well organized, cubical.*

*Amy slid into her orthopedic chair, she scoffed to herself. As if anyone besides her cared. As the screen flashed to life, the iconic Windows theme chimed just loud enough for half the office to hear. She sighed, looking forward to her day of vocational mediocrity.* 

*She pulled her chair closer to the desk and began to work. But her mind wasn't on her work. It was elsewhere; daydreaming. She was a nose hair away from permanently spacing out when the voice of her boss cut through the air with a jagged blade, Amy's boss invited her to sit down.*

*""Amy, and used a program called 'Rainmeter' on the company computer. What can this program do? How does it work and how can I connect with others who use this program?"". Amy was surprised.

[Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/cms/) is a program designed to allow you to display customizable widgets and skins right on your desktop.

You could go balls out and [dual-screen that shit](http://i.imgur.com/fwgHs.jpg)...with portals? 

The super-nice thing about Rainmeter is they make their [source code](http://rainmeter.net/cms/Source) open and available to anyone who wants to tinker. This gives users access to a ""robust tool-kit"" to help them craft their dream desktop info-interface.

&gt;*But what if I'm not a developer or programmer? Won't it be hard for me to sculpt an interface as beautiful as the one's I see in r/Rainmeter?*........

&gt;&gt;***NOT TO FEAR!*** They have a great [on-site tutorial](http://rainmeter.net/cms/Rainmeter101) aptly named ""Rainmeter 101"" that takes you through the basics of the program. This 101

With Rainmeter you are able to ""enhance your Windows computer at home or work with skins; handy, or your online data streams, including email, RSS feeds, and weather forecasts.""

r/Rainmeter exists as a place for Rainmeter users to ask questions, I would recommend any Windows user to take a look at what Rainmeter has to offer, not only as a product/service, but also as a reddit community.

Last week I had some requests to cover more unique and substantial subreddits

It's a strictly moderated subreddit where memes and troll responses are strictly forbidden

[Apparently they probably would've still collapsed due to internal political strife.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/us8k5/if_columbus_hadnt_discovered_the_new_world_and/)

* Ever questioned whether the US's actions post-9/11 would've played out differently had Gore been elected instead? [According to r/HistoricalWhatIf-ers

* Want to go back in time and create a Fallout-esque future? [Then go back and successfully assassinate President Kennedy, galore!

/r/HistoricalWhatIf is full of such delightful theoretical situations and thoughtful discussions, so tread thoughtfully and carefully when you visit, else you shall probably be met with a hail of downvotes.

&gt;&gt;**ContentWithOurDecay** Sorry for the late response! My apologies to hippiemachine.  But I'm the mod/creator/etc of /r/historicalwhatif.  

&gt;&gt;So I guess without any hub bub here are my responses:

&gt;What inspired you to create r/HistoricalWhatIf?
&gt;&gt; ~~Heh

&gt;&gt;**ContentWithOurDecay** I can't find the link right now

&gt;What is your all-time favorite ""What If"" that's been in featured your subreddit?
&gt;&gt;~~I liked reading about how [a seceded South probably would've allied with the Germans in WWI](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/robgc/what_if_the_american_civil_war_never_happened/) but still been economically impoverished

&gt;&gt;~~It apparently wouldn't have been very beneficial or different for them in the long run since the US would've eventually fought and defeated them had they lasted until WWII and they were mainly an agrarian society

&gt;&gt;**ContentWithOurDecay** I can't link to a specific ""what if"" out of memory but my favorites have always been events that revolved around the French Revolution

&gt;What moment in history do you think was most pivotal in shaping the world as we know it today? What would you have wanted to happen at that moment instead
&gt;&gt;~~I have no idea seeing as I'm not very well versed in history

&gt;&gt;**ContentWithOurDecay** I'd have to say the invention of the radio. Or rather the discovery of radio waves?  To me that was the starting point of the 20th century.  Radio &lt; TV. In terms of mass production of a message and ideas that was the pivotal event.  Maybe not the most important on it's own merits

&gt;As per your sidebar: why can't we ask ""what would have happened if Jesus was a trained Ninja""? Do you just hate Jesus
&gt;&gt;~~Yes. I hate awesome things. GRRR!! I am such a kill joy.~~

&gt;&gt;**ContentWithOurDecay** Sorry to be a task master


&gt;Has it been difficult to enforce a high quality of discourse?
&gt;&gt;~~I am not qualified to answer.~~

&gt;&gt;**ContentWithOurDecay** To be honest no.  The subreddit

Interview with the mods

&gt;1 How did you get into map making?

&gt;&gt;**McGravin** Primarily Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other roleplaying games. I was never satisfied with the default setting they give you, and we would add to the map together.


&gt;&gt;**Shagomir** I have been studying and drawing maps for most of my life. I have stacks and stacks of notebooks filled with maps I drew while bored in school


&gt;&gt;**Senseitaco** I was very into geography even as a little kid; I'd take a globe to bed to study before I went to sleep. When I discovered fantasy worlds made by Tolkien and the like


&gt;2 Real geographically speaking which continent is your favorite? Why?

&gt;&gt;**McGravin** Real world? Hm... I wish I could answer ""all of them"". I can't think of a single continent that doesn't have some truly astounding and beautiful geographical features. North America has the Grand Canyon, Ha Long Bay, and Son Doong Cave... Africa has Kilimanjaro and the Sahara... Australia has Ayers Rock and the Great Barrier Reef... Antarctica has Mt. Erebus and Lake Vostok. I could go on for hours listing real-world geographical features that nothing I can dream up will ever beat, and I like to think I have a pretty fertile imagination!


&gt;&gt;**Shagomir** Iceland. I know it's not really a continent


&gt;&gt;**Senseitaco** I think I have to go with Europe. From the Alps to the fjords of Norway to the lowlands of the Netherlands to the Iberian Peninsula, though; Australia and Oceania's probably a close second.


&gt;3 What is one surprising thing you've learned while map making.

&gt;&gt;**McGravin** Honestly, you can build an entire thriving world. And there are so many useful resources on the internet to help you.


&gt;&gt;**Shagomir** Not so much surprising


&gt;&gt;**Senseitaco** Not really surprising, fascinating.


&gt;4 If you could change one thing about Earth what would it be?

&gt;&gt;**McGravin** It would be a pretty big change, and hopefully mostly peaceful.


&gt;&gt;**Shagomir** I would want way less humans on Earth. I wouldn't kill them


&gt;&gt;**Senseitaco** I'd want more land! Oceans are amazing, to me anyway.


&gt;5 Tell us about the community


&gt;&gt;**McGravin** It's important to note that worldbuilding isn't just making maps of places that don't exist. It's also about creating fictional plants, culture, cosmology, history... We have a lot of map making in the sub at the moment, so I'd like to build up the other half of worldbuilding to match it.


&gt;&gt;**Shagomir** I absolutely love the community we have. Our goal as a team is to grow /r/worldbuilding into one of the premier places on the net to show off your creations; learn about how to create your world; and get critiques and help from fellow worldbuilders


&gt;&gt;**Senseitaco** I'm busy as shit today, and to say thanks for featuring us!

Humans. The peak of evolution. The creators of our own destiny. The masters of the universe... no wait... that last one is He-man. Anyway. Parents are people too. People... who made more people.

**THINK ABOUT IT.**

 Anyway. We've all heard fantastic and hilarious stories from *our* parents

The majority of posts are cream of the crop selection of past posts all put together in one location. For me to sigh and groan at. This subreddit is a the definition of what not to do, I don't have a kid. Cause if I did, you could bet on your life I'd be the center of discussion on that subreddit.

There isn't a lot of posts there so far... so you know what to do reddit. Go forth and populate... that subreddit. Not vaginas. You've already seen what happens when we do that.


&gt;#1. Why did you make /r/Parentingfails?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Tyler1243** Well, to share fails and laugh at them in a community!

&gt;#2. Whats your favorite post so far?

&gt;&gt;**Tyler1243** I like everyone I see here

&gt;#3. What is the #1 tip do you have for new parents?

&gt;&gt;**Tyler1243** Well, then chances are you shouldn't be doing it.

&gt;#4. What was the worst thing your parents/guardian(s) ever done to you?

It takes a lot to scare me. And after being in this internet world and playing all sort of crazy games

I love human psychology. To think what is going on a serial killer's mind, or in a mind of a killer who has just killed someone viciously and is standing in a middle of a blood bath, or one who kills his own parents, or maybe someone who enjoys torture, or in the mind of someone who is just about to kill a child or someone who is gonna kill a lot of people in a single switch.  
Knowing what is going in their unique insane minds and *what makes them tick* is something what gives me immense satisfaction. maybe i am a little weird but i love those things and its one of my sides which no one has ever seen.

/r/FearMe is one of the subreddits who dwelve into this amazing human mind and unwraps the deepest fears within us. Going inside the insane minds of humans is its motto and captures it. Its shown in different visual ways and it was explained in the post of /r/TheoryofFearMe in [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryofFearMe/comments/ys8ht/welcome_to_theory_of_fearme_please_read_before/). I just love this subreddit. If i feel like sometimes in a quiet evening to go into my thoughts and think about human psychology i do find myself browsing this sub many times and i am sure will enjoy as much.
here i am now honoured to feature this sub.

here's an awesome interview with the mods!

&gt;##1 what motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**Psychosonic:**  Well me and /u/wetzels-pretzels and I also moderate /r/Fifthworldpics
**Hansafan:**  I was asked to join by Psychosonic. I was an admirer of the sub and frequent poster. I think many still think of me as that guy that posts practically everything on FearMe. It is my home
**NightmareOnMyStreet:** Been a mod so long(during the first days, possibly in /r/creepy, by /u/wetzels-pretzels and somehow struck up a conversation which led to me being made a mod.

&gt;##2. you must have seen a lot of crazy posts here but which one disturbed you the most ?
&gt;&gt;**Psychosonic:**  Hmm I think moderating here has really desensitised me to ""scary"" things. But [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/FearMe/comments/131nqn/for_the_cursed_children_a_book_of_the_damned/) is probably the most creepy one
**Hansafan:** You know, well, pretense and pompous titles.  
**NightmareOnMyStreet:** Nothing has really bothered me before. Gore posts are always fascinating

&gt;##3. if you moderate this sub. i believe that you dont fear anything :D but is there something which still scares the shit out of you ?
&gt;&gt;**Psychosonic:**  Owls. I am shit scared of owls and their creepy eyes. Especially the ones with black eyes. I watched The Fourth Kind and the owls in that only succeeded in making me more afraid. Other than that
**Hansafan:** Fears and scares are different things. I might jump at a cleverly made screamer .gif
My fears are my own.  
**NightmareOnMyStreet:** As I've said before I'm not easily scared. There's plently of things I dislike

&gt;##4. Do you have anything to say to your present/future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Psychosonic:**  Hello to our new subs
A very special thank you to the ones who have been with us the whole time
Lastly thank you so much to those who stay in character especially in the comments. Us mods really appreciate all of you. You guys/gals are amazing!  
**Hansafan:** Like NMOMS said, if you have a question, or worse, an opinion, use /r/TheoryofFearMe.  
**NightmareOnMyStreet:** New posters:Lurk before posting. We all love Benski

Wow yesterday was sure as hell fun. Wake up, take a nap with the cat, fireworks for dinner, and more booze for dessert. If only everyday were like this. I'd be blissfully diabetic and alcoholic. Oh well, you can't have the good without the bad I suppose. As I lay in bed, In my mind there is a slave driver screaming at the top of his lungs saying, ""GET BACK TO WORK SLAVE!"" followed by the cracking sound of a bull whip to my genitals. OUCHY is right. By a show of ~~hands~~ loud sighs how many of you are going back to work today? Yeah I know, don't want to be called a pedophile now would we?

So yeah, you'd be a liar.

There is something about Scott Pilgrim

Okay Scott Pilgrim is the lead character for the comic book / graphic novel / movie. He plays bass and he's a generic sort of dude. Except he is sorta awkward. He meets a girl called Ramona Flowers who he falls in love with. But Scott's present girlfriend Knives really really really likes Scott. But he's only with her cause well, is Scott's ex girlfriend who plays drums. Stephen is the *talent* aka lead singer. ""Young"" Neil is Scott's replacement. Natalie is Scott's exgirlfriend who dumped him cause he was dumpable. And to round it off Julie is Stephen's ex with a mouth.

If I scared you off

If you want me to explain Scott Pilgrim an more simplier look at the below 

* 1 part comic book
* 3 parts comedy
* 2 parts fight action
* 1 part relationship context
* 3 parts video game references / homages.

If you haven't read the comic




&gt;1 How did you get into Scott Pilgrim? And why do you love it so much?

&gt;&gt;**SpacemanSpiff_** I got into Scott Pilgrim primarily due to my proximity to the setting of the comics (Toronto, and video game fan in Toronto, it’s almost impossible to not love Scott Pilgrim.

&gt;&gt;Why do I love it so much? There’s something about it that makes it so relatable. Sure, in a strange yet believable videogame-esque crossover world. To me, the characters instantly felt so familiar, and can easily relate them to my friends, roommates, and acquaintances.

&gt;&gt;**m myfajahas400children** I first got into Scott Pilgrim when the movie came out in 2010, so I immediately went out and bought all of them, not all at once though, I'm... in between jobs at the moment. I love Scott Pilgrim because I love comic books, video games, Canada, music. It's really a combination of all the things I love. Also, awkward guy with girl troubles. The movie is great too, it's just a perfect combination of comedy and action

&gt;2 The Scott Pilgrim movie... great or the greatest comedy action comic book movie ever?

&gt;&gt;**SpacemanSpiff_** To me

&gt;&gt; I saw a screening of the Scott Pilgrim movie at the Bloor Cinema in Toronto, in the heart of where the story took place. I knew it wasn’t going to be the typical movie-going experience as soon as the entire crowd chanted “We are sex bob-omb” along with Kim Pine in the title sequence. It was amazing to see a movie that was so new already have such a large cult-like following.

&gt;&gt;**m myfajahas400children** Easily the greatest comedy action comic book movie, not until the end. It's a fast-paced, slapstick, action movie, and although I see why some people wouldn't like it, I could probably watch it everyday, or just keep watching without ever stopping.

&gt;3 Who is your favorite character? Why?

&gt;&gt;**SpacemanSpiff_** [Kim Pine.](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/126/8/c/Kim_Pine_by_KaosNoKamisama.jpg) Red hair

&gt;&gt;**m myfajahas400children** [Wallace.](http://i.imgur.com/yczcF.png) The sarcastic gay roommate. He makes me [Laugh] every time he talks.

&gt;4 Be honest

&gt;&gt;**SpacemanSpiff_** A lot. I would actually be surprised if someone had more, exclusives, t-shirts, you name it. I’ve had the privilege to meet the creator, Bryan Lee O’Malley a few times, and Edgar Wright, the director

&gt;&gt;**m myfajahas400children** Unfortunately, I just want to go rob a bank so I can buy it.

&gt;5 Tell us about your community! / Open mic etc etc.

Some people have an irrational dislike of birds. I don't. 

I have a very *rational* dislike of birds.

Enmity has existed between me and the bird race since my childhood. Time and time again, and swooped towards by sparrows. Each time, I stood my ground and stared at them in their beady little eyes, which seem both dead and deeply hungry at the same time.

Each menacing encounter over the years has only strengthened my resolve and dislike. (Sometimes, though. This behavior seems to be universal. 

[Petty theft, all for his own sick little thrills. 

Birds are historically known to be shallow and flighty-[As in

[Then there's this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLIU18s4cy8)- chickens are now laughing in the face of physics. If this isn't troubling

[They will stalk you



[Lastly

But you don't have to take my word for it! There's a whole freaking subreddit for compiling evidence against birdkind. I was fortunate enough to speak to the mods of /r/birdsbeingdicks.

________ 

&gt;Tell us a bit about yourselves. What brought you all together?

&gt;&gt;STORM_TROOPERS: Kijafa he told me about this subreddit and I fell in love with it. Birds are real dicks sometimes.

&gt;&gt;blinkerfluid13: I am just a simple girl who knows what birds are like. Mean things that attack you or convince you they can be tamed

&gt;&gt;Kijafa: Well this all started in a the comment section of a post on /r/funny if I recall correctly. MJF and I were talking about birds being dicks

&gt;&gt;beanieb: Kijafa brought most of us on. We moderate some other subs together

&gt;Has there been a time in your life when a bird mistreated or threatened you? How did this experience affect you?

&gt;&gt;S_T: A year ago I'm convinced the same bird would take a crap on my windshield daily. It was annoying and a pain to clean up daily.

&gt;&gt;bf13: I was once forced onto a picnic table in a park trying to fight geese off with kicks to the face

&gt;&gt;Kijafa: I have had many terrible experiences with birds in my lifetime. In grade school an osprey dropped fish guts on my head while I played outside, geese have attacked me on several instances for simply walking down the sidewalk, and peacocks have stupidly backed up traffic for miles because they are total dicks. My life has essentially been a long string of shitty encounters with birds. Often involving actual shit.

&gt;&gt;beanie: I've had some not so great experiences with geese around these parts. They chased my dog off once, I was running around outside and looked up and ended up with bird shit in my mouth. Disgusting things, they are. 

&gt;What are your favorite/least favorite species of birds?

&gt;&gt;S_T: Crows.

&gt;&gt;bf13: My favorite is the duck because it sits there quietly as I toss it bread. My least favorite is obviously the goose. Geese are just mean

&gt;&gt;Kijafa: Oh also my least favorite species of bird is the seagull. Damn rats with wings. 

&gt;&gt;beanie: My favorite are Toucans. Fruit Loops and Guinness

&gt;While being well established

&gt;&gt;bf13: We will continue to showcase the true nature of birds

&gt;&gt;Kijafa: My plan for the subreddit is for it to continue on it's noble course of highlighting exactly how terrible the members of the avian family can be. 

&gt;&gt;beanie: Continue to plug it so everyone can share the truth of birds being dicks. Nothing brings people together quite like hating things together. 

&gt;Do you have anything you'd like to say to the readers of /r/BirdsBeingDicks?

&gt;&gt;S_T: Thanks for subscribing and I hope you enjoy the subreddit as much as I do!

&gt;&gt;bf13: Readers, show the world what they are too scared to admit. Birds will never be a pet or an ally. They will always be assholes trying to steal our food. Trying to peck our children. Trying to make us feel like they are circling overhead just to poop on us. I SAY NO MORE. We must fight back. Also - point and case. Chicken is delicious. Let's just eat all of them. Checkmate. 

&gt;&gt;Kijafa: To the readers of /r/BirdsBeingDicks: Thanks so much for continue to chronicle the abuses of birds that occur daily across the world. It is only because of you that we could be Subreddit of the Day!

&gt;&gt;beanie: We'll have our revenge. Someday. ",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1dpsp4/may_5th_2013_rbirdsbeingdicks_you_can_flamingo_to/

A drunk
""Don't end mixed up like him, there's no coming back!"".

Sobering up is a lot like a puzzle: you start out with a given arrangement of objects (be it an alcohol addicted mind, and you have to array them into a specific pattern to 'solve' the puzzle. You start out mixed up--a drunk, and then end up solved--a functioning member of society.

[The comic.](http://i.imgur.com/kTuJc.jpg)

In 1974, sold hundreds of millions of copies worldwide. The end goal, the ""sobered up version"", is to get all of the sides of this 6-sided cube into uniform colors. The challenge presented by this puzzle is simple, but incredibly difficult to the uninitiated. The ability to solve a Rubik's cube (sober up the drunk) has become a trope in pop culture--many [movies](http://i.imgur.com/q3R9DQg.jpg) use this skill to establish a highly intelligent character.

It was not surprising that this bestselling, which lead to numerous other competitions as a result. To this day, the speedsolving community is small but strong. A large portion of the speedsolving community is consolidated on their forum, [speedsolving.com](http://speedsolving.com).

In the crossover between [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) and [speedsolving.com](http://speedsolving.com), /r/Cubers.

&gt;## What content do you like to see on /r/Cubers? What is your favorite post?

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Personally I like to see higher level strategy discussions. There are some ridiculously fast cubers on this subreddit and getting their input is always nice. Although it wasn't on /r/Cubers

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I like seeing posts on r/cubers of people's success stories, like when somebody receives a cube in the mail, after posting a comment saying ""I really want a Zhanchi, but I don't have enough money."". Also, I don't really have a favorite post.

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** My favorite posts are the success stories of people getting faster, and I think that sort of thing makes people see our crazy hobby in an awesome light.

&gt;## When and why did you start speedcubing?

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** I got into speedcubing in high school (I attended the same one as my co-moderators Klarkshroder and JrockIMSA08) when Rubik's Cubes became something of a fad around my school. Being a high school student, but there were kids at my school who were like cube accessory dealers). Being the sort of person who's into things like math, CS, and physics, it definitely stuck with me.

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Well, and the rest is history.

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I started speedcubing on Halloween last year; I picked up a cube, I finished my first ever solve. I progressed extremely quickly, and was sub 2 minutes from memory within a week or 2.

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** Like Ilyanep says

&gt;## What do you like about speedcubing?

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Ever since I was a young kid I noticed that I was not a competitive person. I didn't like team sports

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** What I love about speedcubing is the feeling it gives you. I've always loved puzzles, progressing within the hobby (sport?) of cubing continued to make me feel exhilarated.

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** Cubing to me is a really friendly competition. You aren't competing against the other people as much as you are competing against the puzzle. So you get a really great community around it.

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** I've never really gotten quite as into speedcubing as everyone else in the sub (and to be honest

&gt;## Besides the normal 3x3 Rubik's cube, 'megaminx', etc)

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** I have a megaminx and teraminx

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** I'm actually a bigger fan of playing with other puzzles and trying to figure them out. I've probably cheated more than figured out on my own on the 3x3, 5, 6, 7}, a Square-1, and a fairly poorly constructed Sudoku Cube. This isn't to say I've had the time to sit down and figure them out, but I've taken the approach of trying to figure them out on my own with these.

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I own a decent-sized collection, and 7x7.

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** I have a decent collection going... maybe 15 or so puzzles

&gt;## How has the experience of moderating /r/Cubers been? Subreddit history?

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I've had a great time being a mod of r/cubers. I haven't been active for a while

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Good. As jrockIMSA08 said, but I think we'll have a good solution soon. It feels a little odd getting to the point of popularity where you have to make these decisions, but I'm glad I'm a part of it with the other mods. They all seem like level headed dudes who just like to cube.

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** Klarkshroder, I took a look and noticed that we suddenly had several hundred subscribers. That was both awesome and a WTF moment at the same time. There was also the part where I never really expected to have to perform very many moderator-style duties and here I was suddenly watching over a fair amount of content. Fortunately, the other mods (especially JrockIMSA08 at first) have picked up a lot of my slack (like here).

&gt;&gt;The subreddit kept growing, we decided to make him a moderator. He's been very helpful. The story for how kpattycakes became a mod is very similar, but happened a few months later.

&gt;&gt;Right now, and are trying to make a weekly bragging thread so that we don't have 50% of the front page be cube collection and personal best times posts, for example). It's bizarre because I've seen several subreddits undergo this transition, but never been part of having to make it.

&gt;&gt;I hope to keep growing and getting awesome content! It is very nice to see all the activity in the cubing community

Logophilia: The love of words. 

(Not to say that the subscribers are actually attracted to words. It's more of an interest/hobby to seek out and learn these unique words. Just wanted to clarify)

This may be the only part of the introduction that you understand

Now, and enjoy. 

This may seem like a jabberwocky to some

I am quite loquacious, then that may just be because you are benighted. Hopefully, this tympany dystocia can provide you some perquisites in the form of a new quotidian vocabulary. Actually, after perpension of that statement, you will probably go through oblivescence of these stochastic words. 

If you actually understand these words, if you haven't had a consternation that this is a bunkum then this may just have a verisimilitude to you. 

And

As a hobbledehoy

One day

I was invited to a party. I shilly-shallied with the idea because I thought of myself as a solivagant. 

However, but I accepted. I ripped off my shirt, let out a booming ululation, and kicked him square in the chest. 

I was the hero

That is all...

**DIXI!!!**

Now to an interview with moderator Nourn:

&gt;##1) What would you like to say to potential new subscribers before they enter the subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** Welcome to Logophilia

&gt;##2) What was your inspiration for creating /r/Logophilia?

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** Originally I started the subreddit to be a depository for words that I found interesting, and combined that with my natural interest with language it emerged as an organic eventuality. 

&gt;##3) Favorite word the subreddit has introduced to you? What does it mean?

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** Too many to choose! The most recent that I remember was Rhinorrhea: An excessive discharge of mucus from the nose!

&gt;##4) How often

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** Not very often, and the words are frequently not very cromulent to the type of conversations that you encounter in your life unless you are an 18th century biologist.

&gt;##5) Which obscure word were you most shocked to learn existed?

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** Another one that's difficult to say! I think I'll take the cop-out answer and just say that the words that I'm most surprised to learn are always the ones that have the most specific

&gt;##6) Favorite part about moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** Chiefly, I have the privilege of being able to positively affect other people's lives and free information.

&gt;##7) Where do you find these magical words?

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** I'm subscribed to the Merriam-Webster, but for just as many it's the product of reading and tangential research.

&gt;&gt; I also have an extension for Chrome called Google Dictionary which allows me to double click on any word I happen on and it'll instantly bring up a definition for it - so if there's a word I don't recognise I can bring it up and save it for reddit later. I store the words in a bookmarks subfolder in my browser and release them whenever the subscriber-issued words slow down. 

&gt;##8) Would you like to make any closing remarks?

&gt;&gt; **Nourn:** Thank you to everyone who's subscribed to the subreddit over the years.

&gt;&gt; Thanks to Mars for being A.B..

For those who aren't in the know

In the past year

Then came ""Nigel-ing"" or ""Thornberrying"" gifs and images, where it became it a hit with over 2,000 upvotes, however, I couldn't a find a link to this post.

In the past year

/r/NigelThornberry isn't a sub that is necessarily dedicated to the art of Nigel-ing images and videos

Obviously this isn't a sub for everyone, or just like the look of [Nigel Thornberry's regal beak](http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.10216377.4940/sticker,375x360.png): /r/NigelThornberry is the place for you!
 
Here today to talk to us about /r/NigelThornberry is one of the sub's moderators

&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/NigelThornberry?

&gt;&gt;**PsychoTurtle** I don't remember why but for some reason me and my friend ended up talking about Nigel. Then I decided to check if there was a subreddit

&gt;2.How did you guys come to be Nigel fans?

&gt;&gt;**PsychoTurtle** There is some nostalgia involved because I watched The Wild Thornberrys as a kid but its mostly because I like the things people are making.

&gt;3.Why do you think people love Nigel-ing gifs/pictures so much?

&gt;&gt;**PsychoTurtle**My guess would be that they like the reaction they get from people

&gt;4.What's your favorite Nigeled submission?

&gt;&gt;**PsychoTurtle** This ones tough I like almost all of them but my favorite would be [The Hulk](http://i.imgur.com/Nmj6s.gif) or [Gravity Falls](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdl93b8tzX1rrnep7o1_400.gif)

**15,400 seconds**. 

There is something about a [nice watch](http://www.giftswithstyle.co.uk/product_images/q/120/torgoent27108__40187_zoom.jpg) that does something to me. When I see a [lovely piece](http://cdn.hauteliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Swiss_watches.jpg) I stare into it. Like a deer into [headlights](http://www.bestbuyshoppingonsale.com/images/Citizen-Quartz-Eco-Drive-Chronograph-Black-Dial-Mens-Watch-CZ-BJ2115-07E.jpg). I must admit

It boggles my mind how such a crazy contraption was even invented in the first place. Think about all the delicate gears &amp; fine machinery not to mention the precision and the patience required to put it together / repair them. 

Father Time himself once said

The fact that watches have also become all digital doesn't hurt them. It just makes them funkier. And who doesn't like a little funk in their step. ~~People with disabilities that who.~~ With [Tokyo Flash](http://www.tokyoflash.com/en/watches/1/) pumping out the weird on a monthly basis there is no stopping watch fanatics. I'm sure you all remember that [Polygon](http://www.tokyoflash.com/en/watches/kisai/polygon/) watch that was on reddit a while back. The price isn't bad either. It doesn't take long before you got a collection going.

#Interview with the mods coming shortly.

&gt;#1 How did you get into watches?

&gt;&gt;**spedmonkey** My dad has always been into watches, I realized what my dad saw in them - mechanical watches are amazing, for they truly are an arcane yet totally modern piece of technology, a delightful anachronism. They've been built largely in the exact same way, the best still by hand by master artisans, for centuries now. It's a tiny, self-contained machine, that you can wear on your wrist

&gt;&gt; **TL;DR:** I'm kinda a nerd.

&gt;&gt;**ArkJasdain** My fascination started several years ago. I've always been fascinated with mechanical things and how stuff works, and building things for years. At one point I built a functioning papercraft clock, which was probably the genesis of the watchmaking pursuit. It evolved into clockworks and then stumbling into watchmaking and immediately falling in love with the micro mechanics of it all. I had been in college halfway through a computer engineering degree but left that to go into watchmaking. I've since completed two years at a traditional watchmaking school, I'm currently near the end of the admittance process for a different more modern school which is recognized worldwide for its watchmaking program and accepts 6 students every two years and hoping that pans out.

&gt;&gt;****

&gt;#2 What is your all time favorite watch?

&gt;&gt;**spedmonkey** Gosh, though, to own, I'd probably have to infuriate half of /r/Watches and go with a classic Rolex Submariner. It's the quintessential dive watch, a classic design, tough as hell, and versatile enough to wear in most situations. Again, ask me next week and I'd probably have a totally different answer.

&gt;&gt;**ArkJasdain** I don't know if I could pick a single favorite. My tastes are traditional and elegant. I will say I'm absolutely enamored with minute repeaters. Something like this [simplistic one from Patek](http://www.patek.com/contents/default/en/5339R_001.html) would be something I'd covet forever. These watches chime the time by striking gongs inside the watch when you activate a slide on the side of the watch. The mechanics that go into that are amazing

&gt;#3 How many watches do you own and for how long have you had them?

&gt;&gt;**spedmonkey** Being a poor college student, anyway) is probably the quartz Swiss Army watch my grandmother gave me when I was like 12, which I've been too lazy to put a new battery in for years now. That said, if my parents or any generous benefactor is reading this, I'd totally love to get a new watch for Christmas... *(ahem)*.

&gt;&gt;**ArkJasdain** My usable rotation of watches right now is about 16. I've got some that aren't in shape to be worn and parts and pieces of many more. I've always worn a watch but didn't really start collecting or getting some nicer ones until after high school.

&gt;#4 Any watch related story you have?

&gt;&gt;**spedmonkey** In a bit of shameless self-promotion

&gt;&gt;**ArkJasdain** As for interesting stories,000. Lovely night, that was.

&gt;#5 Tell us about your amazing community!

&gt;&gt;**spedmonkey** Oh goodness, insightful, knowledgeable, and helpful than I see on most other communities, and that, more than anything else, is the reason why our little community is such a great one.

&gt;&gt; As mentioned above, people so a great job of being respectful and sharing their opinions and knowledge with each other. We try to make the community above all else reflect the desires and values of our users, and I'd like to think we've shaped it successfully into such an entity. Please, by all means, if you've ever had any interest in watches, feel free to stop by, whether you have a $50000 collection or a $5 one. We'd love to have you. :)

&gt;&gt;**ArkJasdain** As for the /r/watches community, and occasionally share something out of the ordinary. There are people looking for recommendations and feedback on potential purchases all the time, and we have members who have experience at nearly all price points in the world of watches. There are people just wanting to learn how something may work in a watch. There are people who share a recent inheritance they don't know anything about aside from it being their grandfathers old watch and find out it's nearly 100 years old and may be worth thousands of dollars. For the most part we behave ourselves, so people can ask their questions and get realistic feedback, or discuss the finer points of some trivial aspect of a half million dollar watch nobody ever plans to buy. We run the gamut, and people come out learning new things every day.

Now I know what you're thinking: [why should I learn Korean?](http://i.imgur.com/cCVjW.gif) I mean--face it everyone has a smart phone these days. You can just go to your Google Translate app and translate whatever you need. In fact

I sat down with the moderators of /r/Korean to learn more about the language and what about it that interests them.

&gt;##1. Why Korean?

&gt;&gt;    **Pikmeir**    I picked up Korean while living in Korea for a couple of years doing service

&gt;##2. How long have you been learning Korean? Are you fluent? 

&gt;&gt;    **Pikmeir**    I've been learning Korean for over 7 years, and I'm fluent in the language.

&gt;&gt;    **zakool21**    I learned some Korean when I lived there from 2010 to 2011. Not at all fluent. 

&gt;##3. Have you tried learning any other languages? How is the difficulty of Korean compared to those?

&gt;&gt;    **Pikmeir**    Before Korean I took 4 years of French in high school and 2 years of Japanese through self study. Knowing Japanese made Korean much easier to start for me; but past the boost that I got from the start

&gt;&gt;    **zakool21**    I speak fluent French and have also learned Spanish and German. Those area all much easier than Korean.

&gt;##4. What is the one thing about Korean that you either can't understand or frustrates you?

&gt;&gt;    **Pikmeir**    Fan death! But seriously, such as Korean expectations of how things should be, as well as their cultural identity, but I think these differences are common to any culture and part of what makes learning Korean interesting.

&gt;&gt;    **zakool21**    The stressed consonants and difficult grammar are very elusive for me.

&gt;##5. What is one really nice/convenient thing about Korean?

&gt;&gt;    **Pikmeir**    ""Hangul, and although it has its quirks and intricacies is a very well thought out system. Most beginners find it easy and intuitive to learn, and can therefore jump right into learning the Korean language in its true form right away. Also, despite the popularity of K-pop and K-dramas, few foreigners can speak Korean - Koreans love when you learn their language and are more than hospitable to foreigners who take an interest in their country and their language.

&gt;&gt;    **zakool21**    At least it's written in a phonetic alphabet and I can read words that are transliterated from English when walking down the street.

&gt;##6. What is your favorite Korean word?

&gt;&gt;    **Pikmeir**    Although I don't use it often, and is humorous.

&gt;&gt;A: ""Hey that guy just took off his shirt and is doing the Gangnam Style over there.""

&gt;&gt;B: ""...헐.""

&gt;&gt;    **zakool21**    뷁 if I spelled it right. Sounds like BRECK!

&gt;##7. Is there anything you would like to say? This one is all yours!

&gt;&gt;    **Pikmeir**    If you're even a little interested in learning Korean, watch Korean dramas or just learn something new, we all want to help each other learn Korean. Of course, if you're interested in improving your Korean skills, there are plenty of advanced students and native speakers to help you, and plenty of resources to guide you. 환영합니다!

Two years ago I was [dropped into the amazon]( http://i.imgur.com/twbQE.gif) for a reconnaissance mission. I was armed with only a flashlight, and a two way. I was informed that there was a hidden base in the middle of this mass of green. In order to make my way through I had to survive on whatever animals and food I could find. [Two days later I finally found other human life, I tracked this person to their base.]( http://i.imgur.com/uhkw4.gif) I was finally at the source of my agency’s mission. I had to snap 15 people’s necks before getting into the base. What I saw will be forever seared into my brain.


 It was a group of people gifting people items from their amazon wish list. No wonder CTU wanted them shut down,[ but I’ll let Bauer take care of that.]( http://i.imgur.com/8jSkK.gif)

&gt;##1. What made you all want to start /r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon?


&gt;&gt; **VKilledTInternet**:We wanted to start RAoA because we wanted a more consistent place to post and communicate. The core group of folks, this was a literary share kind of thing at first. People would buy books for other people so that they could read them and enjoy them. Eventually in spawned into another board and general wishlists were allowed. For about a year there, we flourished. Enjoying a time of general peace. We had our fair share of trolls, beggars, and whores. People would impersonate each other, ask for things in exchange for nudes, and out and out beg for something because they ""needed"" it. The trolls were all annoying and ridiculous (besides Heron, /r/SteamGameSwap (shout out to the mod team there for being awesome) was my normal place to hang out and I thought to myself ""Well, a place where we can give and be gifted freely. In essence


&gt;##2. What are some things you think people should know about this subreddit?


&gt;&gt; **VKilledTInternet**: People should know that this place kicks ass all on it's own. I posted a YSK topic which garnered us a TON of new subscribers. Hell, there's probably some company/store that will ship to you. You can get pretty much everything on amazon from books, movies, computer stuff, video games, toys, food, etc. On average, if I could get across one thing its the fact that **Getting packages in the mail is probably one of the most awesome things in the world**


&gt;##3. If you could be one character of spongebob who would you be?

&gt;&gt; **VKilledTInternet**: Pffft. Idk. Patchy the Pirate or King Neptune more than likely. (Although I'm sure some would argue I'm more of a Krabs/Squidward combo)


&gt;##4. What’s the best thing you’ve ever bought or received from this subreddit?


&gt;&gt; **VKilledTInternet**: The best thing I've received from the subreddit has been a box of Kit Kats. Whoever gifted me that must of been a dentist because, and I had a lot of money from my tax return


&gt;##5. What is the best thing about amazon in your opinion?


&gt;&gt; **VKilledTInternet**: The best thing about amazon is the wishlists of course! Also: Amazon Prime is WORTH EVERY PENNY if you buy stuff from Amazon often. They have a student program

Fashion for men is a tender subject

/r/MaleFashionAdvice is here to begin turning this culture of frat bros and scruffy young lads into dapper, and wouldn't dream about going outside in anything less.

[](/b12 ""A perfectly maintained coiffure helps too


&gt;Probably asking the obvious
&gt;&gt;**CarlinT**: /r/MaleFashionAdvice is just as the sidebar says

&gt;What are some of your best tips for the common man?
&gt;&gt;**CarlinT**: Fashion is a language. You can choose what you say. Pay attention to fit. Details matter. Think about context.

&gt;&gt;**ZanshinJ**: After you get over the initial discomfort of ""caring"" how you look, break rules, and otherwise add some pizazz to your outfits. Fashion is a language, an industry, and a craft, and it takes time, practice

&gt;What are some of your favorite styles or trends?
&gt;&gt;**CarlinT**: Personal favorites for fall includes cardigans and chinos.

&gt;&gt;**ZanshinJ**: Recently, some designers have started to incorporate brighter, more vivid colors into products which is always fun to play with, as is the resurging ""all white everything"".

&gt;What's a trend that you'd like to see make a comeback?
&gt;&gt;**veroz**: I think Oscar Wilde said it best. ""Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.""
&gt;&gt;Mad Men and Inception seem to have brought about a resurgence in classic men's fashion. As dapper as a man looks in a well fitted suit

&gt;&gt;**ZanshinJ**: This might seem weird, if a bit noisy.

&gt;How in Xenu's name do I tie a tie?
&gt;&gt;**CarlinT**: Here's a [classic picture](http://i.imgur.com/3BMPV.png) that has been floating around the internet for quite a while that illustrates how to tie four different types!

&gt;What made you decide to start/moderate this subreddit?
&gt;&gt;**CarlinT**: Well

&gt;&gt;**Kalium**: I was looking for some advice and ZanshinJ was offering. Then someone suggested a subreddit be created. A few thousand people later

&gt;&gt;**veroz**: I discovered this subreddit about a year ago having absolutely no fashion sense. I spent about 6 months lurking the community -- reading every piece of advice I could find and started collecting hundreds of pictures of styles I wanted to emulate. My interest in fashion has flourished since then and I asked to become a mod so that I could help curate the sidebar with helpful information.

&gt;Are there many women doling out advice
&gt;&gt;**CarlinT**: I don't think there are many women on our subreddit giving advice
&gt;&gt; I also want to give a plug to /r/femalefashionadvice ! They are a new and upcoming community that is nearing 1k members!

&gt;&gt;**veroz**: Very few women know anything about men's fashion. They can tell if someone looks attractive or not, others will actually chime in with some advice.

&gt;Are there any misconceptions you'd like to clear up about male fashion? There seems to be a social stigma relegating men and fashion.
&gt;&gt;**veroz**: Society tells men that fashion is emasculating. That if you accompany a woman shopping

&gt;&gt;**Kalium**: It's OK to care about how you look. It's OK to be able to pull together your own outfit. It's OK to be in control of your own wardrobe.

&gt;Where can I get a nice suit for a good price
&gt;&gt;**CarlinT**:User epicviking recommended to me
&gt;&gt;epicviking is also doing an UoR course about mensware too. Check it out [here](http://www.reddit.com/domain/uormenswear.wordpress.com/)!

&gt;&gt;**ZanshinJ**: We have a great guide to suits [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/e96hr/psa_guide_to_suits/). The short answer to your question is that it depends on the retailer

&gt;&gt;**Kalium**: Indochino comes up now and again. It seems to work for most people

A human and a ferocious animal meet in the middle of a forest. Being ferocious, [giant animal killed by a weak and pitiful human?](http://i.imgur.com/QhEfVKf.jpg) Humans are separate from most other animals in the fact that they make tools. Humans make lots of tools. Humans not only make tools, they [make tools with their tools.](http://i.imgur.com/3Pe5abP.jpg) It's basically their favorite thing to do.

Technology [gets more advanced](http://i.imgur.com/O0rwXG2.jpg) every year. Because humans always use old tools to make new tools

All of these tools [keep getting better and better.](http://i.imgur.com/cV122mW.png) What happens when we reach the peak of this graph? There's a word for that: the Singularity.

What happens at the Singularity? Not much can be said for that at the moment. What can be said

Here's an interview with /r/singularity moderator

&gt;##How did you become involved with /r/singularity and the [SFT](http://www.reddit.com/r/SingularityNetwork) [Network](http://www.reddit.com/r/Singularity+Singularitarianism+Robotics+Artificial+Futurology+Futurism+PostEarth+RedditToTheFuture+FutureWorldProblems+FuturePorn+ImaginaryTechnology+Timereddits+RetroFuturism+Automate+TheVenusProject+Transhuman+Transhumanism+Cyborgs+Nootropics+Cyberpunk+Space_Settlement+SpaceFlight+Cosmology+RedditSpaceInitiative+FuturistPolitics+TotheMoon+SpaceVideos+Starparty+AskTechnology)?

&gt;&gt;**Xenophon1** About three years ago, out of my growing studies in the history of technology, I saw a vacuum in Reddit; a void where everything r/Future might have aggregated. I was in the thick of studying Kurzweil, Vinge, and other proponents of machine intelligence. I was on r/singularity every day and yet I needed more. Realizing the future potential of a larger subreddit devoted to Future(s) Studies that discussed theories like the Technological Singularity, I worked consistently through 9 months, adding new content to r/Futurology every single day. My strategy was consistency. I studied different subreddit's past trends and found that the most consistent subreddits were the greatest of communities. As r/Futurology achieved an exponential growth

&gt;&gt;I was colossally moved by Kurzweil’s vision of the human future and said to myself, our civilization would witness an Automation Revolution that could expand the world by magnitudes greater than the Industrial Revolution of 18th century England.

&gt;##What does this subreddit group hope to accomplish?

&gt;&gt;**Xenophon1** As I witnessed the growth of r/singularity and r/futurology, transhumanism, and machine intelligence to the world. We hoped to help build the culture of Future Studies, Artificial Intelligence, and Transhumanism. We hoped to catalyze the future(s) we wanted to live to see by sharing them with the world quicker than even Kurzweil himself might have achieved. Tracking all mod and meta content while satirizing the rise of the SFW Porn Network, the SFT Netwok symbolized the Singularity, Futurology

&gt;&gt;In the end, empowering, and even paradigm-shattering technologies like Lunar Colonization, Machine Intelligence, Nanotechnology, Seasteading, Anti-Ageing, Avatar Technology, we've created an unofficial open-source project called /r/futuristparty devoted to catalyzing this [political and technological change](http://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/images/2050-technology.jpg).

One day

&gt;*As a student of biology

&gt;*For instance, with more coming rapidly.*

&gt;*Mobile computing, labor-displacing automation, and other broad technological shifts define the current age. And ahead the possibilities are even greater.*

&gt;*It seems to me that all of natural history has been progressing more and more rapidly toward a singularity like event. It seems completely inevitable to me. It must happen.*

a community for **three years** with **1


Back to the Future is easily one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Very few films have illustrated time travel in such an interesting and entertaining way as the BTTF series. My first time seeing Back to the Future was at an early age. I think I was maybe seven or eight. My older cousin picked up his VHS copy of Back to the Future
          
Maybe it was because I was too young and into pokemon to really ever think about time travel before
     
        
     
After the first Back to the Future film ended, I threw in BTTF 2, and once again, my world was rocked.    
     
Now they were in the future! They were riding hover boards, they had the template for you right there! You could have at least created some of the things introduced in BTTF 2!        
        
After 2, just by the sheer badassery of the scene.       
         
Back To The Future will be one of the first films I show to my future children once they're old enough to appreciate this film at even a modicum of its full appreciation. It's one of the greatest stories ever told. And I'm so glad there is a subreddit dedicated to such a great series. 

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create /r/backtothefuture?   
     
&gt;&gt;**j1ggy**: I've been an avid fan of the Back to the Future series since the first one came out. Being about 7 years old then
     
    
&gt;##2.  What should people expect to find in your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**j1ggy**: Anything and everything related to Back to the Future. After seeing the popularity of Back to the Future posts on Reddit, anything that comes to mind.
   
&gt;&gt;**ShwinMan**: Weapons grade plutonium dealing.


&gt;&gt;**QuinnMallory**: Seeing as BTTF is almost 30 years old and there's no chance of a sequel, and we'll have a new generation of BTTF lovers. Despite the 80s setting these movies work just as well today as they did then.


&gt;##3. I know I'm not entirely alone
 


&gt;&gt;**j1ggy**: I don't think I'm going to persuade you, and seeing the repercussions of changing the past. Part III took us to an unfamiliar place where nothing was relatable. It was a real game changer.


&gt;&gt;**ShwinMan**: Out of the second and third movies I honestly think Part 3 was the best. Part 2 had a lot of the cool gadgets and a mind bending plot but for me it failed to match the charm of the first movie. In Part 3 it definitely brought that back

&gt;&gt; **QuinnMallory**: Part 3 is a mirror of the first film, as many part 2's do, it went dark. I like my BTTF experience to be fun, and what's more fun than an anachronistic western? Tom Wilson gives his best performance of the series in this one.

&gt;##4. How many years do you think it will be until we all have hover skateboards?
    

&gt;&gt;**j1ggy**: I can't see anything resembling a hoverboard being out anytime soon. Maybe in the next 20-30 years or so. But it will be restricted to a magnetized arena of some type. Magnetizing the ground doesn't seem very feasible.


&gt;&gt;**ShwinMan**: I wish I could say 2 years but the future looks bleak for us BTTF fanboys.

&gt;&gt; **QuinnMallory**: Not in our lifetimes


&gt;##5. Best part about being a moderator of this subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**j1ggy**: To see the creative content people post and the effort they sometimes put into it. And seeing it without all the mod drama you see in other subreddits. I'm a firm believer of letting a subreddit go in the direction its subscribers want it to. Subscribers are what make a subreddit what it is. I'd rather sit back and only step in when a user abuses the subreddit in some way.

&gt;&gt; **ShwinMan**: I think it's less about the moderator aspect of it

&gt;&gt; **QuinnMallory**: I'm fairly new so I don't really have an answer for this



&gt;##6. Favorite BTTF film? Why?


&gt;&gt;**j1ggy**: The second one for is my favorite. The first one left us with a cliffhanger at the end. I waited years for it to come out and was easily pulled in by all the hype around it. Being able to relate back to the first movie

&gt;&gt;**ShwinMan**: Part 1. Not just because it's the first and 'the original is always the best', comedy, romance, action into this ridiculously great film.

&gt;&gt;**QuinnMallory**: Part 1, not a wasted scene or even line. My one complaint is that Marty doesn't really grow as a character or even have any flaws (the chicken thing wasn't introduced until part 2).



&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

    
    
&gt;&gt;**j1ggy**: Not really. I just want to welcome anyone to subscribe. Feel free to post anything related to the series. Even if you don't have a 1.21 gigawatt power supply on your PC. Stories, you name it. And have fun!

&gt;&gt; **ShwinMan**: If you simply like time travel movies


&gt;&gt; **QuinnMallory**: Yes, these movies wouldn't work with straight logic. It makes enough sense to enjoy it!

Reddit isn't just for shenanigans, there are many professional subs in the reddit-verse. One of those such subs is /r/radiology.

For those of us not in a medical imaging profession, where after much painful adjustment between our teeth and gums, of something akin to the sharp plastic things that come with pizzas to keep the cheese from sticking to the top of the box; the hygienist throws what feels like a [flak blanket](http://imgur.com/7joOOW1) on you and runs behind a thing that looks like what bomb squads stand behind when performing a controlled detonation.

While you painfully try to hold still


While not always the most comfortable things to get

In addition to being a professional sub and the sharing of relevant articles and advancements in the field, and sometimes maybe an /r/gore for the queasy among us. In short, it has something for just about everyone. 

So if you're a professional in the field and you weren't aware /r/radiology existed: come on over.


For the rest of us? Come for the gore





&gt;##1. What would you most like the rest of reddit to know about your sub?

&gt;&gt; **Shadowa4** /r/radiology is just one of the many medical subreddits in the whole of reddit. We are specifically oriented in the subject of all things medical imaging and related topics. A quick visit to our sub reveals that /r/radiology has been a community for 4 years. Although this is technically true, and with little if any content. Upon fulfilling this request, this one mod slowly started posting content, with other users soon to follow. I joined approximately 7 months ago as a secondary moderator. Together we’ve made dramatic improvements in subscriber numbers, submission content, and overall look of the sub. We are slowly, but surely, popularity and interest will be limited; we aren’t looking for large numbers or recognition. Simply stated, sonographers and lay-users interested in medical imaging.

&gt;&gt; **Pintastico** I think Shadowa4 has pretty much got it all covered!

&gt;##2. Are you radiologists?  

&gt;&gt; **Shadowa4**  Some of our users are in fact radiologists, at all. /r/radiology serves as a general sub for those employed, or simply interested in the subject of radiology. Those who are employed in the field range from radiologic technologists, ultrasound technologists, ER staff, physicians etc etc. Users span from all over the globe, and come together to share their common interest in the field

&gt;&gt; **Pintastico** There's two mods, but have good mutual trust and interest in the subject. We make all decisions together and are proud of our small flourishing community.

&gt;##3. Are non-radiologists welcome?

&gt;&gt; **Shadowa4** Of course! As stated above, you are more than welcome.

&gt;##4. Do you have any favorite Tales-from-Radiology type posts?

&gt;&gt; **Shadowa4** Well, [click here .](http://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/15ienu/mri_accident_multiple_images_story_warning/) Most people are familiar with an MRI machine and what it does. However, some people might not be aware of the danger associated with this type of equipment if not monitored/operated in a safe environment. This post illustrates what can happen when someone introduces a large metal object into a room basically housing a giant magnet.

&gt;##5. Do you have any favorite posts? What kinds of posts do you like best?

&gt;&gt; **Shadowa4** Although we receive all kinds of submissions, medical imaging exams (x-ray, CT, MRI, US etc) from either a patient or personal exam. Some brief history is provided in the comments, and the community initiates a discussion on what they believe is “wrong” with the patient. We do not discourage posting personal exams, but we do have clear guidelines as to what type of information can and can’t be included

&gt;##6. Do you have anything else to add that I may have missed?
Anything you'd like to plug (it can be anything or any topic)

&gt;&gt; **Shadowa4** As a final point, for medical imaging professionals and lay users. Over the course of this past year we’ve turned a virtually dead sub into a nice little community, where we can share our common interest in the field. We’ve updated banners, redesigned our sidebar, added flair, and as mentioned before, made our own comprehensive WIKI. /r/radiology even boasts it’s own alien logo now, but to check out all the other medical specialty subreddits this great site has to offer.

&gt;&gt; **Pintastico**
Radiology is one if the most unique medical specialities. Not only does it encompass clinical medicine, information technology and the art of anatomy, it has a universal appeal - who can't be curious as to what the human body looks like deep inside? The images produced by these expensive, technical modern machines can be beautiful, breathtaking and sometimes shocking.
Every picture tells a story - that's why I find radiology so exciting and wanted to share my passion.

&gt;&gt; **Shadowa4** Once again


Thank you! And all the contributors to /r/radiology! That is a great little logo too!

One day, “This looks like your kind of subreddit.”  Like he’s the pinnacle of maturity.  He tried to play dildo in Scrabble.  It was funny, but it was not in the Scrabble dictionary.  But a lot of sexy, sexy words are and it’s hilarious.

That subreddit was /r/im14andthisisfunny.  Because, 69.  You know what’s funnier than 69?  Nothing.

/r/im14andthisisfunny is for that immature humor that we still find funny because

I contacted the sole mod of /r/im14andthisisfunny and Ambassador of YOLO

&gt;#1.  Hey

&gt;#2. How does one become the Ambassador of YOLO?

&gt;&gt;**HoneyBadgers_Forever** THE Ambassador of YOLO is a HIGHLY prestigious job title. At the age of 10 I was flown into Modesto, by this time I was doing exceptionally well and can barely even control my swag talk in a civil conversastion.

&gt;#3.  What’s your favorite submission on the subreddit so far?  

&gt;&gt;**HoneyBadgers_Forever** I would have to say [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny/comments/133xbm/because_numbers_arent_just_numbers_amiright/) is my favorite post as it accurately describes the very high class and tasteful humor of my subreddit

&gt;#4. Is there anything else you’d like to add?

&gt;&gt;**HoneyBadgers_Forever** I would like to add that after only several minutes of creating the subreddit I discovered /r/iam14andthisisfunnywhich is arguably higher traffic

I used to be a religious man, just sometimes there is an equal but opposite to things. They don't have to be in the same place, time zone or even in the same time period for that matter. But they are truly the ying to their yang.

I present to you the case of /r/techsupportgore &amp; /r/techsupportmacgyver. Too equal but opposite forces of of tech nature. Both on reddit. Both easy to access and easy to consume content. My tech life is now complete especially with /r/talesfromtechsupport filling in all the holes left behind from both these wonderful subsreddits. So if you love one

&gt;&gt;**Ihmhi** I wish I had come up with it. Thanks go to /u/Ugbrog for making [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportgore/comments/xs12e/cousin_used_a_golf_tee_and_super_glue_to_fix_his/c5p6slh) (which started it all) and Stewartspicer for actually making the subreddit!

&gt;&gt; You know

&gt;2 How did you end up here? What keeps you coming back?

&gt;&gt;**Ihmhi** Well, but in this case I lived up to my word and posted the very first thread to techsupportmacgyver.

&gt;&gt;**Ihmhi** One. You never need more than one paperclip.

&gt;5 Tell us about your community!

&gt;&gt;**Ihmhi** Well

&gt;&gt; It's not that I don't understand why someone would look at a horrible mess and declare the thing a total wash - I totally get that. Sometimes, you just want whatever's broke to work again and you'll get it done somehow.

&gt;&gt;I think the people who post here have a sort of kindred spirit with the guys in Apollo 13. They had a problem to fix and absolutely no spare parts - just a random box of seemingly mundane things intended for entirely different purposes. Thanks to the hardworking folks down in Mission Control, whereas your average /r/techsupportmacgyver post is a person more concerned with boosting their wifi signal or increasing the battery life of a UPS.

&gt;&gt; We live in an increasingly disposable society. My father is a master carpenter. I've had a hammer or a screwdriver in my hand since I could walk. If something broke, sometimes I failed, but it was always fun and I always learned something new. For instance, I learned that somewhere along the line a factory owner sold his soul to Satan and came up with the idea of security screws. I swear, some of the mechanisms put in place by manufacturers to keep the end user from cracking something open border on Non-Euclidean geometry.

I love the internet. I especially love make believe internet laws. Like Rule 34. If you don't know what that is, there is a subreddit for it."" Such is the case with todays feature.

We the writers of /r/SubredditOfTheDay, lets all just lie on the floor in fetus position with Nutella spread all over our bodies while the neckbreads watch over us in sheer pleasure.

On a side note. If you run a guerrilla marketing company

So what is BraveryJerk? I'll break it down into simple Alcohol Math(s [for you UK readers &amp; /u/MiraP]) .

    1 part Circle jerk.
    1 part Ron Paul.
    1 part the short lived reddit created meme ""so brave"".
    1 part the abuse of the french word ""le"" due to rage comics.
    1 part comic sans.    
    1 part neck beards.
    100 parts crazy.

And you get /r/BraveryJerk. Repeat not stirred. Hold the creativity

Now you may wonder, what with /r/ImGoingToHellForThis or /r/FirstWorldAnarchists being featured by yours truly. I say why not indeed.

####I AM LITERALLY SO BRAVE.

~~No interview with the mods


####Check out this song our own JMaboard [made](http://redd.it/xjcp8) for Braveryjerk.

&gt;1 How did /r/BraveryJerk come to be? Or Tell us how you found /r/BraveryJerk.

&gt;&gt; **XtortionBear** GodOfAtheism founded BJ because CJ (Circlejerk) was getting shitted up with 'so brave' and other atrocities of the English language.

&gt;&gt; **ParakeetNipple** The stuff you see on Braveryjerk was originally a ""cancer"" to circlejerk

&gt;&gt; **Kesha_Paul** When /r/Circlejerk turned into a dictatorial theocracy

&gt;&gt; **POLITE_ALLCAPS_CUY** I came to braveryjerk after I was made a mod by the great moderator and mentor boobies_are_awesome. Originally intended to be a detention center for bravery filled circlejerkers

&gt;&gt;**intermerda** ytknows' CSS was causing havoc in CJ and the mods realized that bravery levels needed to be capped. Our modfather GodOfAtheism created the bravery haven BJ. I jumped in after I saw that debates on merits of resource nationalism were not only allowed

&gt;&gt;**LeDarkFiggot** I found /r/Braveryjerk through my l337 asscock of a friend. It was buckets of semen at first sight.

&gt;&gt;**Mr_Pancake_IV** I found BJ through CJ sidebar because reddit and was looking to be entertained.

&gt;2 Whats your favorite over abused meme so far?

&gt;&gt; **XtortionBear** I love so many of them. The Cyanide and Happiness comic is one of my favs, the Dolan ones are great, especially the poorly-drawn Pokemon like Bulborsir.

&gt;&gt; **ParakeetNipple** Oh man... well I could say the ones that I forced myself. I won't do that though. Even though they're the best ones. I really like the condescending Morgan Freeman macro we have. Usually with that one it follows a format like ""oh you did X thing

&gt;&gt; **Kesha_Paul** My all time favorite is the Ron Paul/clarinetkid because it's a Ron Paul within a Ron Paul

&gt;&gt; **POLITE_ALLCAPS_CUY** ""so brave"". Sure, and you find that brave buckaroo who's gonna give you your scene with the chance to take it... boom! SO BRAVE. When used right, it's super effective (pokemon reference lol xD)

&gt;&gt;**intermerda** I personally don't think there is any over abused meme in BJ. It's a healthy and well-balanced mixture of memes

&gt;&gt;**LeDarkFiggot** Teh couragewolf. I always use him to get my point across

&gt;&gt;**Mr_Pancake_IV** Ducreux meme and high expectations Jackie Chan. First because it's Ron Paul in 18th century regalia and the latter because I made Jackie chan one.


&gt;3 Where do you see /r/BraveryJerk

&gt;&gt; **XtortionBear** The scary thing is that 'so brave' is still going strong. As long as people are coming up with creative and new ways to be retarded with our present memes, like the infamous reddit suicide of vivalocaaa who was literally the bravest of us all.

&gt;&gt; **ParakeetNipple** Our memes are timeless. But I don't see them really dying anytime soon. Maybe transformed?

&gt;&gt; **Kesha_Paul** We will keep making more memes until we literally drown in a puddle of memes.

&gt;&gt; **POLITE_ALLCAPS_CUY** Braveryjerk will find a way to adapt. But, the ""arrow in the knee"" will come back thanks to that brave novelty account.

&gt;&gt;**intermerda** I don't see any memes 'wearing out'

&gt;&gt;**Mr_Pancake_IV** Nope

&gt;4 Tell us about the community.

&gt;&gt; **XtortionBear** I'm not just saying this because it's 'on the record', people find goofy (and strange) ways of being brave here. Everyone's a lot of fun. I bet $20 that we get more modmail than any subreddit of comparable size. But I like it honestly. There's always been a lot of communication between the mods and the subscribers which can be a little overwhelming sometimes because it can get pretty frenetic, but ultimately it's a lot of fun.

&gt;&gt; **ParakeetNipple** The community is so brave. We always see random new guys popping up and making hilarious photoshops,000+ subscribers would post. It's funnier when you post it yourself.

&gt;&gt; **Kesha_Paul** /r/Braveryjerk is a free place. We don't discriminate based on retarded subject matter. We welcome (lol whale cum) all to our little community to take a break from being too serious. Taking reddit to seriously can result in mood swings, and go full retard.

&gt;&gt; **POLITE_ALLCAPS_CUY** Of all the subscribers, so I think people will come, spend some time, and get addicted to bravery. Just don't overdose on it. Bad things have can happen.
&gt;&gt; **Boobies_Are_Awesome**

&gt;&gt;**intermerda** It's a great community with some very intelligent people. We welcome everyone with open arms, modmail and synchtube. We once had Zach Braff, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Louis C.K. as moderators here. Not many communities can make the same claim. We may or may not watch movies together on weekend evenings.

&gt;5 Open Mic / I can't believe I'm letting you guys say whatever you want.

&gt;&gt; **XtortionBear** Um... Ron Paul 2012. Also

&gt;&gt; **ParakeetNipple** Subscribe to this subreddit if u literaly crai evertim ;_;. Vivalocaaa deleted his account for your cowardice. Ron Paul 2012. U WOT M8? [This interview is over when I say it's over!](http://i.imgur.com/BExPW.png)

&gt;&gt; **Kesha_Paul** It's always been a fantasy of mine to be a sex slave for 2 atheists, and vice versa. Slowly sliding my lips up and down his thick shaft, tasting his pre-cum on my tongue. Once he's had enough of that, he rolls over onto his back, lifting me up as though I weighed nothing. Gently placing me on his cock, I guide him in, feeling him stretch me wide open. I moan with pleasure, I feel it rumble deep in his chest, his hands either side of my waist. He is in total control, almost imperceptibly. I slowly stroke myself

&gt;&gt; **POLITE_ALLCAPS_CUY** What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, and I have over 300 confirmed deconversions. I am trained in evolutionary microbiology and I'm the top debater in the entire tri-county area. You are nothing to me but just another Facebook comment. I will wipe you the fuck out with reason the likes of which has never been posted before on this subreddit, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with denying evolution to me over the Internet? Think again, kid-fucker. As we speak I am IMing my secret network of Diablo players across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the logic, you Republican peice of shit. The logic that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your critical thinking. You're fucking retarded, fundie. I can be anywhere, anytime, and that's just with Google. Not only am I extensively trained in formal logic, you irrational shit. If only you could have known what un-""holy"" retribution your little ""rational"" argument was about to bring down upon you, you sky wizard worshipping child. I will quote Sagan all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead

&gt;&gt;**intermerda** I'm older than 97% of Redditors, by virtue of having read many books, participated in discussions and so forth. Or more simply put, I know a lot about this stuff because I've devoted a lot of attention to it. Like many atheists, I'm mildly proud to have discovered or maybe realized something most Americans don't know: that their god is an absurd fiction. In terms of IQ, I'm more intelligent than about 95% of the population. Most people are stupid compared to me, and I'm not willing to pretend otherwise or engage in unwarranted humility. Yes, but then again you're probably not qualified to play psychoanalyst to me

&gt;&gt;**Mr_Pancake_IV** WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME! I JUST WANT TO STICK MY BIG ROD OF LOGIC IN YOUR BLACK HOLE OF REASON! I WANT TO RIDE YOU ALL THE WAY TO SAGAN LAND. I WANT TO GO DOWN ON YOUR LOWER NECKBEARD. I WANT TO CARESS YOUR TWIN PEEKS OF BRAVERY WHILE SUCKING ON YOUR HARD POINTY PHDS. I WANT YOU TO LICK MY BRAVERY STICK WHILE I SHOOT GLOBS OF RON PAUL ALL OVER THE WALLS. SO WILL YOU STOP FRIENDZONING ME YOU STUPID SLUT AND ACCEPT MY KIDNESS AS TOKENS OF LOGIC INTO YOUR REASON MACHINE. PS: JESUS LOVES YOU AND SO DO I :)

&gt;&gt; **Boobies_Are_Awesome** I really enjoy the free-form of /r/braveryjerk. I can understand why people would think it's a little zany, there's a lot of real time brainstorming that happens. It's amazing to see something organically grow because people aren't afraid to post whatever is on their mind at the time.

&gt;&gt; We have all different types of people that post here. I can't speak for all of the subscribers

&gt;&gt; There's a level much deeper to Braveryjerk than just spouting memes. It's an actual community and legitimate friendships have been formed. At times you can see all synapses firing from the peoples' minds as they make each other laugh.

So I was in a car for 6 hours today. 6. Fucking. Hours. All I had for entertainment was the view from my window. I saw lots of hills and cows. It was joyous.

Now

Anywhoo, I don’t mean a little chuckle. I laugh so hard my coworkers peer into my room to see if I’m ok.

So /r/PhotoshopBattles exists for people like me. I like visiting it when I’m having a bad day or feeling in a particularly cruel mood and want to make fun of people.  So, to talk to us about his sub.


&gt;##1. Tell us about /r/photoshopbattles.

&gt;&gt; **atomichugbot** Plain and simple the subreddit is a place to have fun with image manipulation. Anyone can participate and submit images or themes (within the guidelines/rules). The idea is an OP will post an image and people will shop it to make something amazing. [Here]( http://imgur.com/a/iagYV ) is an album for some examples. It's a great place to improve your skills while having a good time.


&gt;##2. How do you keep things spicy around there?


&gt;&gt; **atomichugbot** We run weekly battles that earn flair and bragging rights and that helps to keep things fun. Also, which brings in new members to our community. We're always open to new ideas and hopefully things continue to prosper.



&gt;##3. Are you

&gt;&gt; **atomichugbot** I'm okay. I've been using photoshop for just about 10 years and love the program. Moderating the subreddit usually keeps me from submitting often but I try to throw in something here and there.


&gt;##4. What are some of your favorite posts?

&gt;&gt; **atomichugbot** Hmmm this is tough. I think a lot of posts have had great entries. I think my favorite posts have had content that is original and gets a genuine reaction out of me. Seeing what people can do with a simple photo is always a treat.


&gt;##5. How do I know the life I'm living isn't just one big photoshopped life?

&gt;&gt; **atomichugbot** This can be difficult because of how easily the content aware tool works in CS5. Your best bet is to look for inconsistencies around you. Any pixels out of place should alarm you to the real world. Also

&gt;&gt;**Sidenote**

&gt;&gt; Can I just make it clear to people thinking about joining our subreddit. We are not/r/picrequests. Our subreddit is not for photoshops requests and I'd just like to make that very clear.

Animals are ubiquitous on Reddit; cats [will always have their place](http://i.imgur.com/L6NqWvy.jpg) in /r/all

But sometimes you might just get tired of seeing a never-ending stream of generically [cute puppies](http://i.imgur.com/Xd5hz0t.jpg) and [adorable wildlife](http://i.imgur.com/uvc0rqX.jpg)

The premise of AnimalsBeingDerps is very simple: post pictures or videos of animals [looking](http://i.imgur.com/GeQqLma.jpg) or [acting stupid](http://i.imgur.com/WLpldMF.gif), [the posted animals are complete weirdos](http://i.imgur.com/uFfU8KJ.jpg) and [probably don't even care](http://i.imgur.com/ZInPCoA.gif) that [the whole internet is laughing at them](http://i.imgur.com/31tuYm2.gif) and [not with them](http://i.imgur.com/KRsgors.jpg); they're too busy [being derpy](http://i.imgur.com/1C8B8Xh.gif) [in their own little worlds](http://25.media.tumblr.com/b075e94a7ae4e1899982bdd060ce0305/tumblr_mk62p9v8st1rjatz0o1_250.gif).

There's just [a cuteness](http://i.imgur.com/x1xNxfz.jpg)  about [stupid animals](http://i.imgur.com/ah8KFvT.gif) that [I can't quite explain](http://i.imgur.com/sCJmvyS.gif).

Do they just make us feel superior with their [childish innocence](http://i.imgur.com/qxTc8Mv.gif) and [just plain silly antics](http://i.imgur.com/hADvxaR.gif)?  

Is [their misfortune funny](http://i.imgur.com/6hjJFrR.gif) because of schadenfreude or [are their situations so ridiculous](http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dog-flips-over-ball1.gif?w=450&amp;h=170) that they harken to the silly cartoon violence many of us grew up with? 

I can't say either way; all I really know is that [this camel is hilarious](http://i.imgur.com/kdf4Oti.gif) and [this pug is making me smile](http://i.imgur.com/QJLchKC.gif)

Here today to talk to us more about this sub and [its broken animals](http://i.imgur.com/GnDbdge.gif) are 6 of its mods: **/u/Kon-chezz**, **/u/tara1**,  **/u/leftabitcharlie** and **/u/NiceTryNSA**! Let's give them all an [eerily human handshake](http://i.imgur.com/s6cdkwQ.gif), except for  **/u/jaxspider**, the CSS stylist mod of the sub who [declined an interview](http://www.bellybillboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/booing.jpg) because he's [a Batman](http://img2.joyreactor.com/pics/post/comics-the-oatmeal-batman-parallel-universe-716042.png) kinda guy.   

  
&gt;#1.What inspired you to create r/AnimalsBeingDerps?

&gt;&gt;**Kon-chezz** A gif was posted to /r/AnimalsBeingJerks last month

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa** I didn't create it

&gt;&gt;**tara1** Unfortunately

&gt;&gt;**leftabitcharlie** Beer + wine while browsing /r/AnimalsBeingJerks and a comment by Kon-Chezz was the initial catalyst. I tried to ply the subreddit with a bunch of stupidly titled posts

&gt;#2.Are you guys affiliated with r/AnimalsBeingJerks

&gt;&gt;**Kon-chezz** We definitely got our start and a large amount of our initial subscribers in /r/AnimalsBeingJerks. We we're able to reach out to the mods over there and a few of them were willing to help us out. It's been great having there modding experience.

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott** Yeh

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa** I mod /r/AnimalsBeingJerks and /r/BirdsBeingDicks. There's definitely some mod overlap between the subs.

&gt;&gt;**tara1** I'm the creator of /r/AnimalsBeingJerks

&gt;#3. r/AnimalsBeingDerps has an incredibly large subcriber count despite being such a young subreddit. How did that happen

&gt;&gt;**Kon-chezz**  I have no idea 0_0! We had a few x-posts here and there

&gt;&gt;**NiceTryNSA** We plugged it at the right time of day on /r/newreddits and a few other subreddits, and I front paged a few ""title (xpost /r/animalsbeingderps)"" in default subreddits.

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott** The mods here have worked very hard at promoting this subreddit and it really paid off.

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa** Lots of plugging

&gt;&gt;**tara1** The moment I saw the first x-post from /r/AnimalsBeingDerps in /r/AnimalsBeingJerks


&gt;&gt;**leftabitcharlie** The only slight difficulty while modding I've found is when a post is hilarious but you know that the animal in the gif or pic is probably in a bit of discomfort and you have to make a moral judgement on whether it should stay or not (we've tended to leave most posts up unless there is intentional and direct animal cruelty involved). But this could hardly be called difficulty. 


&gt;#4. Why do you think people like looking a pictures of silly-looking animals?
&gt;&gt;**NiceTryNSA** it's the Internet.

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott** I think it's because after a long hard day of working, it's nice to just enjoy yourself and laugh at silly things. It can really cheer ya' up, y'know?

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa** Why do we smile when children laugh? Why is bacon tasty? Why is moonlight romantic? Some things just are.

&gt;&gt;Also it's the perfect combo of saying ""awww"" and laughing that just makes you smile inwardly.

&gt;&gt;**tara1** Some people have animals of their own as pets and they can relate to the silly things that animals do in this subreddit. This subreddit just lightens up their day and makes them laugh.

&gt;&gt;**leftabitcharlie** I get a kick out of animals which seem to behave sort of human. When they bugger up whatever it is they seem to be trying to do it's even better. I think that a lot of people also feel the same way ([many thanks to La Fontaine and Aesop](http://i.imgur.com/wUgV22K.jpg)).

&gt;#5. Show me your favorite animal derp.

&gt;&gt;**Kon-chezz**  [This derpy pug puppy is probably my favorite.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingDerps/comments/1f1ary/derpy_pug_doing_a_derpy_walk_old_xpost_from_rpugs/)

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa** [This one.](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr02/2012/12/15/17/anigif_enhanced-buzz-3237-1355608952-1.gif) Silly dog

&gt;&gt;**tara1** [This just makes me laugh so much. It's one of my favorite.](http://i.imgur.com/SJfljwY.gif)

&gt;&gt;**leftabitcharlie** [This one](http://i.imgur.com/YOxQqCM.gif) always makes me smile. The indifference in [this one](http://i.imgur.com/ChLZWF1.gif) makes me happy. I love [this idiot](http://i.imgur.com/ADdEFVE.gif). It's really difficult to choose

&gt;#6. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Kijafa** Thanks for making this sub great! Lets keep up the quality animal derp-age.

&gt;&gt;**tara1** Buckle up guys because this is going to be a silly/funny ride.

&gt;&gt;**leftabitcharlie** I'd like to thank everyone who's added to the subreddit in some way. Especially those who've provided original content of their own pets. I also think that derpiness is pretty subjective, but I have a soft spot for posts which add new meaning to a seemingly normal image with their titles. I enjoy filling in what we don't see with a silly scenario implied in the title, so kudos to those who've tried to do a bit of that.

&gt;&gt; I can't thank everyone enough, so I apologise for my inane ramblings.",,False,self,t5_2sgno,1372344417.0,WRITER,

**2

Is it a popular theory among teachers that there are no stupid questions? Is there such a thing as a stupid question? Is this subreddit the perfect place if you think your question may be rejected in other subreddits? Should I ask questions throughout this feature?

To answer those: Yes, and maybe?

/r/NoStupidQuestions believes you should not be ashamed to ask a simple question. This is the internet after all

I personally agree with them. I agree with them so much that I challenge you, and I will answer it to the best of my ability because I believe any question is worth asking. 

Now for an extremely educational interview with the moderators of /r/NoStupidQuestions

&gt;##1) Is there anything you would like to say to potential new subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Use the search feature before you post a question

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Make sure your question hasn't already been posted

&gt;##2) What was your inspiration for creating or becoming a moderator for /r/NoStupidQuestions

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** The inspiration came from this when someone asked ""What question are you afraid to ask because you don't want to seem stupid?"" Then someone suggested it be a monthly series and I suggested a subreddit. Badda Bing Badda Boom. /r/NoStupidQuestions was born.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** I actually created a similar subreddit

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Iirc I asked Claire if she needed any help modding this place when it was first created and he added me.

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski:** I had an idea for a subreddit exactly like this

&gt;##3) Why is it called Rhode Island when it's neither a road

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Because Hilly Bit Of Land With Some Flat Grassy Fields And A Short Beach didn't have the same ring to it.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Why is Disney World called Disney World if it's not actually a world?

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Because Murica is silly.

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski:** Because shut up.

&gt;##4) Why is it called a ""drive through"" when you have to make a stop?

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** You're doing something wrong if you have to stop.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** You're doing it wrong.

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Well if you go really slowly and the staff work quickly you wont have to stop

&gt;##5) Why are softballs so hard?

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** I.. I'm not sure.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** My softballs are not hard... hehehe

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Because Darkrai is a really cool Pokémon.

&gt;##6) Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Please stand up. Please stand up.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Well you asked nicely.

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** Yes.

&gt;##7) Where do babies come from?

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Sex without a condom.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Female vaginas.

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** My penis.

&gt;&gt;**drumcowski:** God. 

&gt;##8) What do you enjoy most about moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Everything since it's the only subreddit I moderate.

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** I like contributing to the subreddit and reading all the funny/insightful questions posted.

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** The content is quite interesting and I've managed to learn quite a bit from modding it

&gt;##9) Would you like to make any closing remarks? (Shameless plugs

&gt;&gt;**I_Miss_Claire:** Thank you to all our subscribers in the past

&gt;&gt;**I_DONT_SLEEP_A_BIT:** Thanks for being awesome!

&gt;&gt;**sfitzknott:** If you too are a brave and euphoric atheist then come to /r/BraveryJerk.

#[r/MLP](/r/mlp)

/r/MyLittlePony has 2, and it's not on their page. I'd say the numbers are pretty similar, however.

I can admit without fear that I am a huge fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. The first thing that I would like to say about it is that it is very nearly 100% different than the common conception on My Little Pony. The only thing that is similar to the older series' is the name, and watch more than just the first few episodes. I think we can all agree it gets much better later.


Now hang on folks, Sethisto and GeorgeCareline (which you might have already guessed from the wonderful title). I'm going to have to cut some stuff to keep it normal length, so I apologize in advance. Let's get started!

&gt;Tell us the stories that led you to become bronies.

&gt;&gt; **Sethisto**: I ran into the show on 4chan way back in October and thought it was completely ridiculous. I didn't even make it 10 minutes into the first episode.

&gt;&gt;I ended up going back a week later though out of curiosity

&gt;&gt; **megadeus**: I became a fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic through a friend of mine who is an even bigger geek than I am and Team Fortress 2. I'm a fan of Team Fortress 2

&gt;&gt;One day

&gt;&gt;""No,"" he said. ""It's about My Little Pony.""

&gt;&gt;I, and that my fiancée had remarked ""Ew, they made them look like Bratz dolls."" (At the time, I agreed. I have since embraced the super-deformed aesthetic of the G4 ponies.)

&gt;&gt;So I joined the pony server and was immediately bombarded by songs from the show being spammed over the voice chat. Players pasted pony-themed sprays all over the maps and gave themselves pony-themed names. The actual match was a horrible stalemate because the micspam was so intrusive we couldn't adequately strategize vocally

&gt;&gt;I slowly warmed up to the ponies

&gt;&gt;As soon as I had watched a few episodes on YouTube, songs, and humor all exceeded my expectations and soon I was making pony sprays for TF2, downloading pony song remixes off YouTube, and seeking out ponies on the pony-themed chans and reddit. I started spamming my own pony music on TF2 and used name tag items to rename my Mediguns ""Anypony need healing?"" and ""Anypony need kritz?"" (Career Medic here.)

&gt;&gt;I lurked, I've helped by adding a few more Ponymoticons and hope to continue doing so in the near future.

&gt;&gt;The subreddit is growing by leaps and bounds every day and I can't even imagine the influx we'll get when Season Two starts this fall.

&gt;&gt;My favorite pony is Rarity.

&gt;&gt;TL;DR: I saw a sonic rainboom in the sky that pointed me towards /r/mylittlepony

&gt;&gt; **Lebal**: I was on another forum when some of my friends posted image macros of MLP. Then the Pony Thread started. Then they made a ""secret police"" to find neighsayers in the forum. I was mostly just watching from the sidelines watching the mock war go on.

&gt;&gt;Then

&gt;&gt; **KefkaFloyd**: I read the TV/IV thread and thought ""Ponies? Hah."" Until I actually read up on it and watched it (sometime around Call of the Cutie airing). When Suited for Success came on and was basically Clients From Hell: The Episode

&gt;&gt; **Funkz**: At first I dismissed the thread in TV IV but then someone posted that Pinkie Pie compilation

&gt;&gt; **MinusX**: I was linked by a friend to the first MLP thread in TV/IV on SynIRC with a ""HAHAHA LOOK AT THIS"" I looked, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic: Sailor Moon P?"" Not wanting to knock off the show that easily (The avatars were entertaining at this point) I decided to watch Dragonshy as at the time that was THE episode to watch. I watched it, and it wasn't BAD per say just not something I was really interested in.

&gt;&gt;At that time FYAD had a thread about it which I found interesting. It was basically mocking the users posting about the thread, I had watched about eight episodes because I had nothing better to do, and I decided to give it a second shot after seeing the same Pinkie Pie compilation Silly Pony saw. By the time I started actively chatting in the IRC channel, I had watched the rest of the episodes there and slowly started to get on people's good sides by being helpful and somehow ended up as a mod of the forum and the chat.

&gt;&gt;Now I've shown the show to tons of people on and offline

&gt;What is it about the show that makes you love it so much? Do you think your tastes line up with most other bronies in those respects?

&gt;&gt;**KefkaFloyd**: I think the primary reason I like the show is because the characters all have their own neuroses which make them more interesting than the usual ensemble type shows. Twilight is a huge nerd, Rainbow Dash is a braggart and loudmouth, Pinkie Pie is insane and Rarity is an obsessive-compulsive artiste. It manages to appeal to me in the same ways that shows like The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab, Animaniacs, Freakazoid, et cetera did back in the day. Except, with watercolored ponies.

&gt;&gt;A lot of fellow fans (I dislike the term ""brony"") probably enjoy it for similar reasons

&gt;&gt;**Blarghalt**: It makes me smile. It's just so goddamn happy and you can tell the creators were so happy making it that you really don't have a choice in the matter. I'm not much of an animation buff

&gt;Sethisto

&gt;(Hehe

&gt;&gt; **Sethisto**: The main point of the site initially was to compile everything /co/ did

&gt;&gt;I wasn't really expecting FiM to become too popular initially.  I figured it would just be a small niche and fade away in a few months

&gt;To Sethisto again, what's your favorite? I'm partial to the grimdark stuff, I just love the directions people go with it. Evil Celestia stuff kills me, it's so easy to make her into something scary.

&gt;&gt; **Sethisto**: I read some when I have time primarily the comedy ones like Ballad of Twilight Sparkle.  I'm not too big on grimdark really.

&gt;Anything you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; **Sethisto**: I invite everyone to come join in the brony revolution!   Most of us are having a blast



I spoke with GeorgeCareline

&gt;&gt; **GeorgeCareline**: If you read through some of the comments on MLPFiM, and similar proselytizing speech. People talk about how they've learned about love and tolerance from the show, or how it affected their lives. This should be put in perspective: it's a kids cartoon with corporate-approved educational messages. It's not a religion or a philosophy. I think latching on to the show as if it's the second coming, pestering people to watch it, and promoting it as some sort of self-help doctrine, eventually paints the fans as nutjobs.

&gt;Very interesting

&gt;Do you like the nomenclature as much as everyone one else seems to? What is your opinion on all these communities popping up

&gt;&gt; **GeorgeCareline**: Fox News' [Red Eye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps-WRFYACHk#t=8m50s) hosted a very lighthearted chat on the subject

&gt;&gt; The many different communities represent the different types of fans. DerpyHooves.com looks like the fan-site with the most mainstream appeal, so it might be heading the way of ponychan. The nomenclature in itself is not problematic, aside from potentially excluding women; however I feel the way it's used draws people to the proselytizing aspect of the community.


At the end of the day, though? Our motto has always been ""Love and Tolerance"", and the community enforces that to a T. I believe the show is objectively good, and subjectively fucking excellent. Give it a chance, friends.

&gt;&gt;**ichthis:** I like the ones with the owls in them, and owl rescuer /u/iDolly [holding an enormous Great Gray Owl.](http://www.reddit.com/r/thesuperbowl/comments/14verv/me_with_a_fluffy_great_gray_owl/) But don’t try and hold enormous Great Gray Owls at home! He’s an expert.

&gt; What kind of rules do you have on this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**ichthis:** Post owls! Also, but is more closely related to the nightjar. Just owls. We don’t want this place to end up like /r/mountaingoats which is full of bighorn sheep. Seriously, mountain goats aren’t even proper goats. And unlike owls, they can’t even fly, not unless they’re being murdered in the back by Golden Eagles. We like owls.

&gt; What is your favourite type of owl?

&gt;&gt;**ichthis:** Small is beautiful. Elf Owls are small but so hardcore they live in cactuses. Come at that

&gt; Any advice for a scrumptious Superb Owl snack?

&gt;&gt;**ichthis:** Fresh field mouse

&gt; Whats the best way to watch the Superb Owl? Do you prefer tailgating or watching them on the big screen?

&gt;&gt;**ichthis:** It’s really hard to keep up with an owl

&gt; Any words of Owl wisdom to leave us with?

&gt;&gt;**ichthis:** Hoot hoot. Hoot.

There. Isn't that nice? Nothing interesting about this subreddit, and I've got the cure.      
    
Maybe I just have a completely ass backwards sense of humor, run by a very gracious /u/sli and the devilishly charming /u/Apostolate.    
    
[/r/notintersting/](http://www.reddit.com/r/notinteresting/) delivers exactly what you want; a subreddit that is so uninteresting, and then I wondered where the day went. Then I went to bed, and cried myself to sleep. Then I woke up to write this SOTD post.

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create r/notintersting?   
     
&gt;&gt;**sli**: It just sort of popped into my head one day while I was browsing r/mildlyinteresting.    
I thought it would be some silly fun to extend the premise of the subreddit to its logical conclusion.      
Strangely, boom. I noticed a strange amount of posts on my frontpage, and a friend asked me what was going on. I guess all it took was a couple mentions elsewhere by non-affiliated Redditors.     
A fun fact: one of the people that mentioned it happened to be a fellow mod of another subreddit. It's a small internet.     
     

&gt;##2. What should people expect to find on your subreddit?      
    
&gt;&gt;**sli**: Nothing of interest. Things that are so boring that they push the boundaries of ""pedestrian."" People seem to have figured it out pretty well. I can't say the same for Reddit's spam filter
          

&gt;##3. Have you had to remove anything because it was too interesting?    
    
  
&gt;&gt;**sli**: Once, but that only really works for subreddits with under a thousand people. Inevitably, modding will have to get a little more stringent. As of now, however, people are doing a pretty good job of staying within the premise.      
      

&gt;##4. What is the single most uninteresting post you've seen submitted?     
    

&gt;&gt;**sli**: Going to have to give that award to [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/notinteresting/comments/114j1x/my_room_with_the_light_off/)

If you could peak into my mind you'd step into a war zone. One side of my brain loves doing random things while the other side needs to make 2 weeks plans before he decides what kind of pants I should wear at a casual party among acquaintances. Its like really mild bi-polar syndrome. Charming but annoying at the same time. As of late I have decided

But seriously you can really learn to live a little. No one wants your smoke ridden [kidneys NY guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/17tmh8/21mnyc_lets_be_friends_while_i_worry_if_youll/) Quit it with your paranoid crap. Your kidneys aren't special. If I wanted kidneys I'd just get them at the black market on Canal St. Atleast I know they'd be fresh. Even if they are counterfeit.

/r/MakeNewFriendsHere is a fairly new subreddit. Its not for hooking up, rape &amp; murder. But to each their own taste, I suppose. Its for finding people of similar interests as yourself. /r/MakeNewFriendsHere just implemented a new flair feature to see what country you're from! So be sure to use it! 

Here is the interview with the extroverts mods.

&gt;1 How did you end up in /r/MakeNewFriendsHere?

&gt;&gt;**/u/1Voice1Life** Long story short, the lack of friendship and socializing. These troubles have made me to think about the other people in the world, who have the same problem as me. If I can't find myself friends/best friends (at least if I tried to look for friends, I would've had a couple friends by now. But I didn't.) My life experiences has led me to make /r/MakeNewFriendsHere, its for the people who either have no friends or do have friends but want to extend their friendships.

&gt;&gt;**/u/backpackwayne** After my long years and experience at /r/assistance

&gt;&gt;**/u/battlesmurf** I became a mod by asking on a /r/needamod post.

&gt;&gt;**/u/QwertyDerp** I saw the post looking for mods in /r/needamod

&gt;2 Favorite positive story so far?

&gt;&gt;**1Voice1Life** My favorite post of /r/MakeNewFriendsHere got to be [**this one**](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/14y6sz/35mitaly_smiles/). It not only made me smile

&gt;&gt;**battlesmurf** I can't find my favourite post

&gt;3 What has been the weirdest post so far?

&gt;&gt;**1Voice1Life** Not sure if the weirdest

&gt;4 If I were to post there

&gt;&gt;**1Voice1Life** Everyone that posts a thread in /r/MakeNewFriendsHere becomes an approved submitter (I do this just to prevent the spam filter from catching the wrong posts.) and a upvote from me.

&gt;&gt;**backpackwayne**  If you posted you would become the Beyonce of the subreddit. Meaning that you would look like a superstar

&gt;&gt;**battlesmurf** You will be loved by all.

&gt;&gt;**QwertyDerp** Every war eveywhere would end simultaniously. Then everyone would cry tears of joy.

&gt;5 Tell us about your present community and what you envision the future of /r/MakeNewFriendsHere.

&gt;&gt;**1Voice1Life** Our present community is an international group of people, I'm predicting tomorrow will bring in a lot of traffic to /r/MakeNewFriendsHere. Some of the people might not react that well, and cause trouble in our IRC. Everyone in the original IRC channel will jump over to the secondary IRC on that day.

&gt;&gt;**backpackwayne** What is awesome about this subreddit is you can make friends next door or on the other side of the globe. Truly amazing! Here there are no countries, or no young or old. – We are just friends. Helping each other get through tough times and having fun. This subreddit will do nothing but grow and be a fun safe place to hang out with good people. Trolls are not welcome. It's just just good people and good times.

&gt;&gt;**battlesmurf** Our present community is great and filled with lots of friendly and helpful people. As any mod would I hope the sub continues to grow and becomes renowned for being a friendly place.

With the holiday season upon us

Picture it.  The year was 1992.  My family had spent our whole lives playing video games on our parents’ hand-me-down Atari 2600.  I mean, my brothers had gotten Keystone Capers and Dig Dug for their birthdays just the year before.  Dollar stores were magical in the early 90s.

Anyway, my younger brother had a controller, and my youngest brother had Mario Paint.  And set up on a TV tray by the Christmas tree was the SNES in all of its glory.

I’m not much of a gamer, and it was our main console until we finally got the Playstation for Christmas in 2000, and even then we still spent a lot of time on our Super Nintendos.

The very first video game I bought with my own money was The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.  Street Fighter II was the first time my brothers accused me of cheating in a video game.  Barkley Shut Up in Jam made me realize my parents did pay attention and knew I loved basketball.  Even the very last game we bought for the console, how did we know that balancing a shoe on the console would get some of those pickier games to start?

/r/snes is dedicated to this magical console that forever changed my childhood

&gt;#1. Why did you choose to get involved with the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Zook** When I was younger

&gt;#2. What is it you expect from the subreddit and its community?

&gt;&gt;**Zook** /u/instintoanimal and myself expect a tight community of dedicated gamers that love the Super Nintendo. Even with the system being as old as it is

&gt;#3. When did you get your first SNES?

&gt;&gt;**Zook** Back in Christmas 1992.

&gt;#4. What was your favorite game on the console?

&gt;&gt;**Zook** This is probably the hardest question people will ask me. There are so many great games for the Super Nintendo that I have greatly enjoyed. I always stick to my original answer though and that comes down to the first game I was truly hooked on with the Super Nintendo. That game is called Super Metroid. The graphics are absolutely beautiful. Combine that with the true total immersion of the game and it's a complete winner in my book.

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**Zook** We have a lot of ideas for /r/SNES that we are working on. I've been in contact with a lot of people so that we can make those goals a reality. One of the biggest things we're getting ready to implement are gaming challenges. We will be working with stores to provide prizes for people that actually participate in the contests. One thing we can say about the contests right now is that they'll truly challenge Super Nintendo Gamers. As for everything else

/sorry

Maybe once in a generation, and yet once exposed, a truth so *obvious* that it *changes the way everyone thinks,* at the same it seems as if it has *always been known.*

For though trees are [giving](http://mikearauz.tumblr.com/image/820350373), shade, life, yadda, yadda, yadda: the simple truth is that trees [suck](http://www.reddit.com/r/TreesSuckingAtThings/comments/wsa70/trees_suck_at_riding_bikes/) at an [awful](http://www.reddit.com/r/TreesSuckingAtThings/comments/11qdw9/trees_suck_at_being_perverts/) lot of [things.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TreesSuckingAtThings/comments/yptw8/trees_suck_at_playing_hide_and_seek/) And this observable truth, must needs observing.


And so, that true visionary of our time, the creator of /r/TreesSuckingAtThings (not to be confused with /r/TreesSuckingOnThings): /u/pseudolobster!


&gt;##1. Sometimes you see things and you think to yourself why didn't I think of that? And other times you come across something so awesome you know you could never think of something that brilliant and just bask in its glory

&gt;&gt;**Pseudolobster** Well it all started when [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wqvri/a_tree_sucking_on_a_boulder) hit the front page. For the next couple days

&gt;&gt;So I decided to make a subreddit, when you think about it, there's really a lot of things trees are no good at.

&gt;&gt;Within hours of creating /r/TreesSuckingOnThings


&gt;##2. Do you have any personal experiences with trees sucking at things you would be willing to share publicly?

&gt;&gt;**Pseudolobster** I don't like to get involved with trees. They do their thing


&gt;##3. Do you have any all-time favorite submissions?

&gt;&gt;**Pseudolobster** When the subreddit was new

&gt;##4. What would you like new visitors to /r/TreesSuckingAtThings to know about your sub?

&gt;&gt;**Pseudolobster** It now has 20% less sodium than the leading brand.


&gt;##5. Would you like to say anything to your current subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Pseudolobster** What the hell are you people doing with your lives?


&gt;##6. Do you have anything to add? Or anything you'd like to promote or plug?

&gt;&gt;**Pseudolobster** I'd like to give a shout out to /r/FWEPP, /r/scoreball, /r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/, /r/polygonwild, /r/vxjunkies, and all the other weirdo subreddits. I'd also like to plug my other subreddit /r/progravity - to balance out all the anti-gravity propaganda around reddit.

There comes a time in a man's life where he knows what he wants. Unfortunately, behind every great man, there is a great woman, well, behind every great woman there is a [great ass.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfCjxDTyOIA)

Do I really have to go on about why you should check out /r/Ass? Well Billy, you become either an ass-man or a titty-man. Most men are hybrids, we tend to like a little bit of everything, thats just how awesome evolution is. Checkmate religious people!

I should also talk about if you're born a gay male or if you're born female and are straight/lesbian. If you like admiring female butts /r/Ass is for you too! Everyone is welcome to drool. 

Here is the interview with two of the mods from r/Ass. The always slimy yet delightful /u/violentacrez and his henchman of doom /u/DragonHunter.

&gt;#1. What qualifies you as an ass moderator?

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez** As the Pimp Daddy

&gt;&gt; **DragonHunter** I was brought on as a moderator after I suggested we keep /r/ass porn-free. It has been my pleasure to remain true to this quest. Plus

&gt;#2. Your Top 5 asses. List / link them!

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez** [One](http://www.reddit.com/t9rkc), [four](http://www.reddit.com/rfb1u), [five](http://www.reddit.com/i21lu).

&gt;&gt; [1](http://i.imgur.com/XZbOv.jpg), [4](http://i.imgur.com/8lhaN.jpg), [5](http://i.imgur.com/rs0RL.jpg)

&gt;#3. How is moderating a NSFW subreddit different than a regular subreddit? Besides the porn itself

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez** It's all images, and much less discussion. It's usually fairly quiet.

&gt;&gt; **DragonHunter**  haven't noticed a significant difference between NSFW and SFW reddit moderation. We might see a little more spam in the comments.

&gt;#4. What is your stand of butt implants?

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez** Do. Not. Want.

&gt;&gt; **DragonHunter** I don't have a strong opinion on implants, I would surely have a three-way.

&gt;#5. Open Mic. Say whatever you wish. The floor is yours.

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez** FREE SANDOSSU! Our noble founder, and the admins will not respond to requests asking why he was banned. He's been a stand-up redditor for over 5 years, and it pains me to see a good redditor get banned with no explanation.

&gt;&gt; **DragonHunter** I would like to thank Lela Starr for being in porn. Her ass is painfully hot. And thanks to all /r/ass contributors. It's a beautiful place. Also,True,nsfw,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,t3_tegzv

There lies beneath the surface of the smooth, circuitous series of tubes that make up the internet in order.

*They* work in tech support.

Yes, hidden away from prying eyes. But for today, a special treat. /r/TalesFromTechSupport, the secret lair of just some of this fraternal congregation, has given us a peek inside the complex. This day, we can all look into the world of IT, to understand what it's like to see the dark side of humanity, on a daily basis. 

Step inside, disturb, or even awe you. You may be emotionally shattered, experiencing the feelings anew of a newborn, cold, afraid, and alone in a loud

Thus is /r/TalesFromTechSupport.

RevRaven and MagicBigfoot were the guides on this tour of their guilded hideout. The conversation is transcripted below. 

&gt;What's the strangest experience you've had while working in tech support?

&gt;&gt;RR:At my previous job

&gt;&gt;MBf:As a young tech, and could we please make it stop and also let him know what it was we wanted with him. I'm pretty sure I just froze from context shock; I had no idea how to even begin with the poor guy. After a very painful moment or two, I was thankfully saved by an older tech who tactfully got him pointed in the right direction (aka, our exit).

&gt;What's the funniest/strangest experience you've ever read in TFTS?

&gt;&gt;RR:I see hilarious stuff here all the time. Rarely is it hilarious because it's new. It's usually hilarious because it's the story of my life. To pick a single post would be really hard

&gt;&gt;MBf:There is no possible way to choose. I am blown away every single day reading through the posts &amp; comments here. I feel like Scrooge McDuck diving around in his gigantic pile of money

&gt;A lot of people seem to use this subreddit to vent about the profession. But what is the most rewarding aspect of tech support?

&gt;&gt;RR:For me

&gt;&gt;MBf:For me, restoring a hashed client database, resolving some completely crippling network issue that's costing big bucks, or most important of all, undeleting Mom's photos -- at the exact moment you succeed you are, for all practical purposes, A WIZARD.

&gt;What advice would you give someone entering tech support?

&gt;&gt;RR:You MUST have thick skin. Dealing with users is challenging, you will take the brunt of all of that. If you can't take it in stride, then you will likely fall apart when it hits the fan in situtation where your job is on the line.

&gt;&gt;MBf:Let go your feelings. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/TalesFromTechSupport?

&gt;&gt;RR:You guys have been an amazing group of people. For a subreddit this large, have it pretty easy. We get to sit back and enjoy the show. This subreddit is all that we ever hoped it would be. We just had our 1 year anniversary, it suer doesn't feel like it's been a year. Everything this subreddit is, is because you guys made it that way!

&gt;&gt;MBf:Rev said it already. Our job is ridiculously easy. It might be because our contributors spend a lot of time camped out at the extreme edge of the ""Keep Calm &amp; Carry On"" bell curve, it makes TFTS a really great place to share stories &amp; hang out. So to everyone who has been a part of our first year, I'd like to say thank you, thank you, thank you all for helping to make this sub so fantastic.

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create /r/JenniferLawrence?   
     
&gt;&gt;**lavaeolus** I created it just after seeing Jennifer in The Poker House. She had been cast as Katniss I think about a year before
     
    
&gt;##2.  What is /r/JenniferLawrence? What should people expect to find in your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**atticus138**: Pics

&gt;&gt;**atticus123**: The Poker House

&gt;&gt;**Lunatic14**: Silver Linings Playbook

&gt;&gt; **JFN1234**: She's so amazing in X-Men: First Class. She took Mystique to a whole new level.


&gt;##4. Were you surprised to see she won the Oscar for Best Actress?

    

&gt;&gt;**lavaeolus**: A little. She was the one favored to win by many people


&gt;&gt;**JFN1234**: Not at all. She too amazing not to win :).


&gt;&gt; **Lunatic14**: No I felt she was great in that role and the movie was fantastic.



&gt;##5. Best part about being a moderator of this subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**lavaeolus**: The community

&gt;&gt; **JFN1234**: Modding with some of the best mods on reddit.


&gt;&gt; **Lunatic14**: Being able to mod for a great actress such as Jennifer with the best mod of reddit.




&gt;##6. Any rules that you would like new subscribers to be aware of?

/r/DailyDouble is a hilarious subreddit taking the logistics of the classic game show [Jeopardy](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/625326/celebrity-jeopardy-o.gif) and throwing reddit one-liners into the mix. Cheat sheet: submitters will provide the answer

[Jeopardy](http://i.imgur.com/On9xRDs.gif) is a game show phenomenon dating back [more than 5 decades](http://i.imgur.com/dmIYkOJ.gif)

I have loved yelling at the TV [since I was very young

&gt;Are you big fans of Jeopardy? Ever met Trebek?

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** Yes and YES! I can also confirm that Alex is a fan of our work and has recently become an active participant in /r/DailyDouble. Needless to say

&gt;&gt;**TeapotOnMyHand:** I watch the show at least once a week. I once went to a taping of Jeopardy

&gt;How has this subreddit become so popular so quickly?

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** Reddit and *Jeopardy!* have long been secret lovers, as people began spreading the word, tagging us in other subreddits. ‘/r/DailyDouble’ tags have become popular in all of the big subreddits.

&gt;Whats your favourite submission so far?

&gt;&gt;**DrTetromino:** [This is the one TV show you don't want to be caught masterbating to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDouble/comments/19oqf1/this_is_the_one_tv_show_you_dont_want_to_be/)

&gt;&gt;**Haptens:** Sometimes the questions alone make for an amazing thread but my current favourite is [The first tweet from the new pope..](http://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDouble/comments/1a89vz/the_first_tweet_from_the_new_pope/).

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** For me

&gt;Any celebrity contestants?

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** Aside from Trebek you mean? I can neither confirm nor deny that 1 or more former SNL castmembers who took part in the various Jeopardy! spoofs are also contestants. Off the record

&gt;&gt;We are also proud to announce that we have gone ~~7~~ 0 days without a PictureOfMyButtHole related incident.

&gt;&gt;**Boetbra1:** Does /u/Haptens count?

&gt;Who is responsible for the subreddit design?

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** Everything was a team effort in theory

&gt;How are the rules enforced?

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** We have literally had to do almost nothing to enforce the rules of the subreddit. Like I said, what’s appropriate. Submissions ('Answers') have to be juicy enough to invite good responses, and the responses have to be creative enough that they catch someone off guard. Every good redditor has that mojo within them, and I feel like they come to /r/DailyDouble to have a place to release that energy.

&gt;What's this Final Jeopardy! thing we keep hearing about?

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** Glad you asked! *Final Jeopardy!* is our new monthly contest in which 9 people compete for Reddit Gold! In order to be one of the nine finalists

&gt;Anything you would like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Redditedid:** I’ve never started or moderated a sub before, bar none. We are constantly doing our best to catch them off guard, and each time they end up coming out of left field and knocking it out of the park. Could not have asked for a better group of people then the ones we’ve got right now.

Hey there redditors and lurkers (if this subreddit gets any of those)
Today I have the distinct pleasure of introducing to you a subreddit that might change you life. 

/r/EmmaWatson is a [pretty much] dedicated image board for all the  non-stop Emma Watson action you could ask for. 

Considered to be one of the hot-hottiez on reddit

Now, probably a guy, is browsing /r/EmmaWatson and jacking himself off like there is no tomorrow. Maybe using a fleshlight. On his dong. I can only provide conjecture at some point. Let your mind finish the rest of the scenario. You know it's probably happening now. I mean c'mon. Out of the 16,000+ subscribers /r/EmmaWatson has, ONE of them has to be masturbating to her pictures right now; however, DO NOT let this discourage you from enjoying Ms. Watson's celebrity. She is a fine young woman and a symbol of a younger, more british generation.

Before I begin, buildup to that apology with background. Two days ago the calendar of March opened up, which makes the first few days hectic. I grabbed the 2nd because it needed doing, and grabbed /r/outside because it was next on my list. I immediately messaged the staff (read: 1 person) of /r/outside asking for an interview, and it wasn't until this morning that I was informed that I wasn't getting an interview. The exact text: ""No."" So I'd like to apologize for the lack of an interview here. Don't let it sour your views on an otherwise good subreddit.

/r/Outside is indeed a good subreddit. It's a bunch of people talking about life as if it were an MMORPG with over 7 billion players. Kind of like .hack

It's mostly just short jokes about items or quests, level caps, rendering, accounts, and support options. I chose it for SRotD not for its post quality but for its funny pictures. I like funny pictures, though not as much as our resident gif maestro. (You know who you are.)

/r/AskReddit (AR) claims to be for asking thought-provoking questions. They lied. This is the true insightful question platform of Reddit. /r/TrueAskReddit (TAR) is all work and no play

In all seriousness though

I can’t blame AR for this though. I love that sub

Fortunately, we all know that if that doesn't work out then you can always move back to the TrueAskReddit. 

I sat down and smashed letters into my keyboard for this interview with the head moderator: /u/WellEndowedMod

&gt;##1. What about AskReddit finally pushed you over the edge and caused you to create TrueAskreddit?

&gt;&gt;**WellEndowedMod** /r/TrueAskReddit already existed
&gt;&gt;As for my reasoning behind supporting the subreddit to it's current, in some ways it's gotten worse and some changes are neither good nor bad in the grand scheme of things, I think. /r/TrueAskReddit is simply a catchy name which implies elitism - that is something that puts some people off but draws others in. Exactly what I wanted.
&gt;&gt;However, it's that people see funny/good content and they think ""Hey, it looks easy enough - maybe I'll try!"" and most of them don't have anything noteworthy to say/create but they'll post it anyway, oh yes. Novelty accounts used to actually live up to their name as novelty accounts, now to have a novelty account is no longer a novel thing because everybody and their unborn child is doing it.

&gt;##2. What has been your favorite discussion/question thus far?

&gt;&gt;**WellEndowedMod** http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/vn44z/is_it_really_so_wrong_that_i_simply_want_to_be_a/
&gt;&gt;It might not be the best, because that's my own, subjective, opinion. Read it and decide for yourself if you like it.


&gt;##3. Least favorite aspect of AskReddit?

&gt;&gt;**WellEndowedMod** Idiocy. I was an AskReddit regular. I was in every new thread to the point where I (on an old, or reddit even, that well you understand it that much more and the more you understand it the more jaded you become. I first ""got""/r/circlejerk after spending years in AskReddit. When I first looked at /r/circlejerk I thought it was just a bunch of morons and I didn't understand. When I looked again it clicked and while it's not a bastion of excellence all the time there are plenty of gems (forgive me) to be seen.
&gt;&gt;Anyway, idiotic posts. The same jokes again and again. The same gifs (this is a more recent phase, though) again and again. AskReddit is like a TV series in it's 8th season - it's jumped the shark and everthing you see if a bad copy of what was once great or it's something new and very unrefined.


&gt;##4. Do you still go on AskReddit

&gt;&gt;**WellEndowedMod** Every other day I flick through



&gt;##5. How do you feel about the [new-ish rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1479bw/modpost_getting_back_to_our_roots/) prompted by the mods of AskReddit

&gt;&gt;**WellEndowedMod** To be honest

&gt;##6. Do you think the rules will be enforced? Will you return to the AskReddit if they are?

&gt;&gt;**WellEndowedMod** I have absolute faith that the will be. When I was an AskReddit regular I made some friends and many of them were with me in the new section. A lot of those friends are now mods. Will I return? I don't think so. I just don't enjoy it as much anymore. That part of my life is over.


&gt;##7. Anything else you would like to say to your subscribers

Why ello everyone

I think it’s destiny that this glorious subreddit is featured today

Arsenal is my club and I’m not sure how anyone could choose otherwise
(/u/MiraP I’m looking at you

They are the first club I choose on FIFA and Football Manager (even though I always end up ruining the club because I don’t get Football Manager).

EDIT: To clarify I didn't say I chose this team because of FIFA

I’m not sure if it’s the colors, well, my team and I’m honored to feature them today.

&gt;##1. What made you decide to come up with a subreddit dedicated to Arsenal?


&gt;&gt; **EFG**: I've been on reddit almost since day 1 pretty much, and so that move was pretty much a no brainer.


&gt;##2. Why do you like Arsenal?


&gt;&gt; **EFG**: Aside from their nickname being the ""Gunners


&gt;##3. What are your hopes for Arsenal this season?


&gt;&gt; **EFG**: My hopes are nothing less than the full quad: Champion's League, and the Mickey Mouse Cup. I go into every season with the delusion that we can and will win it all until reality uses its chisel to steadily chip away at that until I'm nothing more than a pile of disillusioned chaff. If we're going to be realistic, then I expect us to reach at least the semi-finals of each cup mentioned, and give a strong title-contending run in the league.


&gt;##4. Who is your favorite Gunner?


&gt;&gt; **EFG**: Dennis ""the non-Flying Dutchman"" Bergkamp
...Profundity.

&gt;##5. If you could have any player join Arsenal who would it be?


&gt;&gt; **EFG**: Mario Gotze

&gt;##6. Any matches you’re looking forward to?

&gt;&gt; **EFG**: All of them. For me, our match with the Spuds (Tottenham Hotspur) this weekend should be good.


&gt;##7. Anything you’d like to add or say to your subscribers?


&gt;&gt; **EFG**: Keep the Faith. So much bickering and mewling over a run of bad form and we forget that we are the Arsenal. Also, and if you have graphical inclinations, I'll make you a mod there. Our sub is looking too plain compared to lesser teams. And as always, keep it classy, keep it Goonerish!



Big thanks to EFG for answering my questions and I’m slobbering just waiting for Saturday’s match.

As you may have figured out by now, [r/OnePiece](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/y91yy/august_15_2012_ronepiece_pirates_a_samurai_a/) &amp; [r/FairyTail](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/vog5j/june_27_2012_rfairytail_once_upon_a_time_japan/). Atleast we have good taste. It shouldn't be shocking, good entertainment can be found in many places.

While doing some research for this feature... I realized... holy shit. 1998 was a great year in television. Here is a list of just some of the great shows (be they animated or not) that came out in '98.

* DragonBall Z
* /r/WhoseLineIsItAnyway?
* MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch
* That 70's Show
* The Powerpuff Girls
* Pokémon
* MTV's TRL with Carson Daly
* The Wild Thornberrys [*Smashing!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ1dYrjuYf4)
* Sailor Moon
* The King of Queens
* CatDog
* V.I.P. (Pamela Anderson) [*Hahahahahahaha*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OinoZW2abB0)

DBZ short for DragonBall Z starts where Dragon Ball ended. Goku's a full grown adult and his destiny to become Earth's savior is just beginning. So you want a microscopic intro to it? Sure. There are 7 orange crystal balls scattered around the world. If you collect all 7 of them

Sure the original DragonBall Z was made to get kids to sit in front of the TV everyday and buy DBZ stuff. It was basically Japan's version of Transformers and TMNT... although Transformers was animated in Japan too... soo... that (business side of the) story is way more complex for me to talk about here.

All you need to know is ...

* Goku = good
* Vageta = bad then good, then good.
* Bulma = smart girl
* Piccolo = Green alien
* Krillin - Was equal to Goku in Dragonball
* Gohan - Goku's love child with Chi-chi
* Trunks - Vageta's son
...

Okay I just realized the cast is huge and even with my horrible horrible micro synapses of the cast

Like I mentioned above

Recently

##Interview with the mods on the way.

&gt;1 how did you find DBZ?

&gt;&gt;**modcaleb** When I was younger my grandfather used to have to babysit me on most weekdays. He liked wrestling

&gt;&gt;**Krillin** I started with Dragonball Z in 98-99 in Japanese on VHS tapes my friends and I would buy bootleg from an Asian market

&gt;&gt;****

&gt;2 Who is your favorite character that isn't Vegata / Goku.

&gt;&gt;**modcaleb** Tien. He is still the only Z-Fighter that's still believes he could surpass Goku one day. That and his Tri-Beam makes a square hole. I find that funny.

&gt;&gt;**Krillin** Isn't it obvious? 

&gt;&gt;****

&gt;3 If one fight in the series was different which one and why?

&gt;&gt;**modcaleb** I don't exactly want to change a fight more than see one I've always wanted. I have always wanted to see Goku go head to head against Android 17 &amp; 18. In every alternate timeline Goku never had the chance to give them what they wanted. An epic battle.

&gt;&gt;**Krillin**  Goku vs. Turles

&gt;&gt;****

&gt;4 Cell Saga = Best arc or the bestest arc ever?

&gt;&gt;**Krillin** No. Frieza Saga will always be the best. 

&gt;&gt;**modcaleb** I'm going to go ahead and side with /u/Krillin on question 4.

&gt;&gt;****

&gt;5 If the powers that be actually decided to make more Dragonball animation

&gt;&gt;**modcaleb** I'm curious to what the new movie in March is going to be like. I haven't exactly decided whether or not it could count as Canon to me. I think it's safe to say Toriyama is about done with Dragon Ball so I wouldn't expect a new series being announced anytime soon. If a new Dragon Ball series were to happen you bet your ass I'm going to watch it regardless if it's another noncannon piece of garbage like Dragon Ball GT. If a new DBZ video game were to release (that's NOT based off of Ultimate Tenkaichi) I'm going to buy that too

&gt;&gt;**Krillin**  I'll watch it. I'm the kind of guy who hates anything not canon but will still watch because damn it's Dragon Ball.

I love Nintendo. I'm a biased, I'm sure of it!

I've never owned a NES or SNES, or my Gameboys. Then there's this awesome little Nintendo Power that I've kept stashed in my bedroom since the tender age of 3 ([:D](http://i.imgur.com/s7rZx.jpg)): it may  be a bit tattered around the edges, but all those childhood memories of lusting after Nintendo's games come rushing back when I flip through its pages.

There's a place for people like me on Reddit, and as you'll see in our interview with the energetic Mr. **samueldlockhart**, this sub is certainly not in want of mods who care. 

Now make no mistake- /r/Nintendo is not a sub where you'll see karma whores pimping out pictures of Mario Kart on the shelves of their local Goodwills, but they seem to be few and far between, which seems to be unusual for a sub of this size. 

But enough about me and my thoughts about this sub. Let's allow **samueldlockhart** to give us a little background on how /r/Nintendo has grown over the years and been re-tooled into the sub we see today!

&gt;1.What inspired you to create r/Nintendo?

&gt;&gt;**samueldlockhart** /r/nintendo was created by /u/Suicide_Guy back when subreddits were first introduced to Reddit. I joined the modteam in September last year - initially just to contribute some CSS - and we had less than 2, and promoted me to lead mod.

&gt;2.What up with that auto-moderator bot? Did you guys make it

&gt;&gt;**samueldlockhart** /u/AutoModerator is /u/Deimorz's work - there's a list of its capabilities here but if you're interested you should speak to Deimorz. We only really use it to filter memes

&gt;3.So tell me more about your subreddit. I see there's a distinct lack of memes and controversial ""DAE remember &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;insert nostalgic game here&gt;?""-type posts in your sub. What made you decide to weed those out

&gt;&gt;**samueldlockhart** Well

&gt;4.Do you guys get a lot of r/gaming refugees?

&gt;&gt;**samueldlockhart** Nintendo, but if that's a 360 then most of your game news and even community is going to be shared with PlayStation and even PC because most titles are multi platform. So I think an Xbox player will see themselves as part of the gaming community but a Nintendo player will see themselves as part of the Nintendo community. 

&gt;&gt;Even on /r/gamernews if you look at the top posts this month there's only one story about Nintendo even though here on /r/nintendo it's been our biggest ever month because of the amount of news in the run-up to the Wii U's release. So to answer your question

&gt;5.All time favorite Nntendo game and system:

&gt;&gt;**samueldlockhart** The GameCube is my favourite console because Nintendo were at their most experimental and risk-taking in their game design. Though you look at the Wii hardware and think Nintendo's doing something different

&gt;&gt;GameCube-era Nintendo had Animal Crossing, Zelda, into a flipping cartoon. I really miss those days.

&gt;&gt;My favourite game is Super Mario Galaxy 2 which is perfect.

&gt;6.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**samueldlockhart** I really love /r/nintendo and the community we've built! If there's anything you want to see don't be afraid to ask.

As you all know

Back to my evil plan, I'm threatening you. Eventually using the model I executed in /r/SubRedditOfTheDay... I will gain control of these master subreddits as well. I will combine all these subreddits to destroy the default subreddits and make them cower before me. And thus the most powerful website on the internet today will be in my grasp. And All I did was pay my monthly comcast bill. Boy those guys are true pros... cutting off my internet at 3 in the morning? WHO DOES THAT?

Here is the interview with evil mastermind mod him/herself.... /u/lufraf.

&gt; 1 How did you come up with /r/myevilplan?

&gt;&gt; I was looking through an askreddit thread a while ago about cool small communities

&gt;2 Whats the funniest post you've read so far.

&gt;&gt; Probably this [one about cookies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/myevilplan/comments/y3jzu/my_plan_to_take_a_cookie/)

&gt;3 If you actually had the resources

&gt;&gt; If the right situations arose and I had the resources I think I actually would attempt to fulfill my schemes.

&gt;4 If you are the villain who would be your arch nemesis... or the hero against you?

&gt;&gt; My plans mostly involve taking control of a corrupt government so my arch-nemesis would probably be any generally smart citizen who realizes what I'm up to.

Remember when people would ask you as a kid, ""A mermaid!"" No Veronica, thats not what... oh nevermind. My smartass would always say something out of the blue just to mess with people, sometimes I'd say I want to be [death](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o-u7XOr22mg/Tq2R5QWbEQI/AAAAAAAAA2g/8Gk7ZexVtb4/s1600/death.jpg), for the shock value.

###Unexpected late addition interview with mod

1. Why / How did you start this place?
2. What are your top 5 posts so far?
3. What post / art piece surprised you the most?

---

I'll tell you what comes to mind to start with:
 
I've always been the sort of ""counterculture"" type
 
Over the years I had amassed quite a collection of [introspective](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/lxbml/trapped/) art
 
Some of it reflects bliss, or [lack of hope](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/jpd5o/oxygen/), but all of it is dealing with [powerful thoughts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/lxbml/trapped/) and emotions. Some of what I posted is visual representation of the physical/mental feeling of [""falling apart""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/jr3kb/falling_apart/), such as this gif I made from a scene of the anime [""Akira""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/r1hvr/crumbling/).
 
Quite a bit of it has an environmental twist, or pollution [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/jpaps/stampede/) [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/jpbcq/breath_it_in_breath_out/), scattered among [imago dei](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/mo9tp/imago_dei/), or [images of god](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/jpdk1/zen_garden/), which, surprising enough, are fairly elusive.
 
Basically though
 
I was the primary poster for about a month, but ***rabmush*** and ***cannibisrex*** stick out the most to me.  We gained about eight subscribers a day at first, and about twenty a day for a few days at it's peak, somewhere around last month.
 
There is a pretty [steady stream of quality posts now](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/jpe3s/its_a_mob_mentality/)
 
There is a definitely a bit of drug influence to many of the posts, but you may notice the occasional reference to lsd or salvia, maybe dmt.
 
I personally haven't used any drugs in quite awhile now.
 
[my favorite post so far](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/qpk8d/industrialization_xpost_from_rpics/)
 
[another favorite](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/plu4q/3_souls/)
 
[pretty sweet](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/nhbsj/road_trip_by_steven_stahlberg_xpost_from_rspecart/)

[probably the most bizarre](http://www.reddit.com/r/Heavymind/comments/jrh2v/ia_ia/)
 
My favorite ""related"" subreddit is probably [Speculative Art](http://www.reddit.com/r/SpecArt/)

Subreddit of the day mods are required to write an introduction for any sub they feature

If you haven't grasped the concept yet - it's about posting pictures

That is really all there is to it. So

My dog, hence the name Muhammad Ali. She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, but what else can I say about that little bitch Ali...

Muhammad is just a pup, pissing, etc. One day in particular, she was even more of a bother than normal. I got home from work to discover the garbage had been gotten into, as evidence by the Snickers wrappers, juice boxes, coffee filters, strewn about on the floor. 

I followed the mysterious trail of trash to the master bedroom. Where I expected to see guilty puppy eyes

""Ali

She smiled and panted back unabashed. 

I would not stand for this. I picked her up and hauled her off to her kennel

The next morning I woke her up at dawn. Rather, but I graced the grass blades from above on the balcony - showering the grass like a golden fountain. I did it the R. Kelly way, as any gentleman would. 

That was the calm before the war. A time of mutual expect for one another's duty. 

I opened the door to the house, she froze in her tracks. 

I locked eyes with her and said ""Ali

Ali stared back at me. A stare of understanding that only a dog listening to a human speak English can have. She nodded. Then

""Ali you bitch! I trusted you.""

[She reacted](http://imgur.com/JVHstQA)

Now Muhammad Ali is where she belongs, out of my life. 

Okay, among other popular reddits. 

&gt;##1) Even though a relatively simple sub to understand

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** Hm. I wish people would be a little more specific with their titles - it makes it hard for other people to search and see if their image has been submitted before if everyone titles their links ""What a jerk!"" Other than that

&gt;##2) How were you able to gain subscribers so rapidly?

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** A few cross posts from our subreddit made it to the top 10 on all. /u/Tara1 did an awesome job posting and I just helped direct her a little bit. I have a little guide over at /r/moderatorduck that I use that's helped me grow /r/isjewboymarriedyet

&gt;##3) Do you have any pets? Are they assholes?

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** I have a dog named Tupelo. He is the sweetest dog in the world - definitely not an asshole!

&gt;##4) Are there any particular posts

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** None in particular. There's just been so many!

&gt;##5) Since you're the expert

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** Most aren't jerks IMO

&gt;##6) Is it true that alligators are ornery because of their medulla oblongata? Is that what makes them jerks?

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** Alligators are jerks because they get stepped on all the time! I think they deserve it for lying in the mud next to my feets.

&gt;##7) I don't normally play the username game

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** I am a duck. I think I'm a nice duck

&gt;##8) Besides posting GIF propaganda against them

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** Post videos!

&gt;##9) Who let the dogs out? Who? Who?

&gt;&gt; **Iamducky:** It was Jerry.

a community for **19 days** with **3


Want to know what conditioner andrewsmith1986 uses in his hair? How long Alexander Rhodes has gone without masturbating? What the creator of the cumbox is eating for breakfast? If you answered yes to any of these questions
    
r/InternetAMA is a place for internet users to come and talk about their experiences on the web. Whether you’re a meme, or just someone that wants to talk, you are welcome at this subreddit.    
   

r/InternetAMA was born from the fires of controversy surrounding the default subreddit r/IAMA

One of the most interesting things about this subreddit is the rapid growth they’ve experienced in such a short amount of time. They’re averaging about 150 subscribers a day, let’s bring in the dancing lobsters!

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create r/InternetAMA?   
     
&gt;&gt;**theKingMan**: I found the inspiration for this subreddit from the ""fox guy"", since Overly Attached Girlfriend's AMA was removed, with the mods directing her to /r/adviceanimals. However, ""fox guy"" is neither an advice animal nor a meme. Thus, /r/internetama was born.
    
&gt;&gt;**AlbertIInstein**: Our growth catalyst has been the growing divide between the /r/IAMA moderators and users. It seemed /r/casualama lacked any sort of quality control mechanism, the 8th most popular actor on IMDB, and Lynfect of cumbox fame did not make the cut. That made us sad pandas. /r/InternetAMA is our answer.

&gt;##2.  What should people expect to find on your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**theKingMan**: A lot of people think that this subreddit is for internet-related things only, you should be able to find all kinds of AMAs here.    
   
&gt;&gt;**loves_being_that_guy**: Right now by visiting /r/InternetAMA you can expect to see a lot of focus on reddit moderators

&gt;&gt;**SpagettInTraining**: It seems moderators and users alike have taken a liking to the channel we opened up between the respective factions of reddit. We make moderators seem and feel human. We offer a channel for novelty accounts to break character. We offer you a place to be heard


&gt;##3. Your subreddit has been growing pretty fast lately. How do you deal with the ridiculous influx of new subscribers? 


&gt;&gt;**theKingMan**: I think this subreddit would probably have received an even greater initial boost had it been created about a week earlier, working diligently, is what makes this subreddit into what it is today.

&gt;&gt;**RedditTreasures**: Considering the short amount of time we have been around

&gt;##4. You guys say that anyone can do an AMA here. How do you ensure that quality of content will stay at a high level?    

&gt;&gt;**theKingMan**: We have a proviso stating the OP must write an opening blurb (paragraph) about themselves if they are not well-known. This stipulation performs three roles: 1) It forces the OP to put some effort into their AMA

&gt;&gt; **chlod4chlod**: Moving forward we are proactively chasing down stars from other venues. We are constantly taking requests, we are just getting warmed up.

&gt;##5. What sets you apart from the other AMA subreddits?

&gt;&gt;**Rolmos**:  [Our theme.](http://www.reddit.com/r/edurne) 

&gt;&gt; **MR_WITTY_RESPONSE**: We look a lot better than some other AMA havens (r/IAMA

&gt;&gt; **theKingMan**: It seems that as of right now, we resemble /r/casualiama, but with a greater emphasis on ""serious"" stuff as well as more internet-related AMAs. We are also the only subreddit whose mods will solicit AMAs from anyone whom they find interesting. Our promo team is second to none, and that fact, above all else, is why we are such a success.

&gt;&gt; **AlbertIInstein**: To add to that, we are trying to maintain a minimum level of quality defined by an invisible bar. Akin to the ""you'll know it when you see it"" rule set forth by Justice Potter, we strive to only remove the most egregiously low content posts. 'IAMA Teapot' will be removed, we don't care how stout you are. Conversely, we will accept offers of porter any day however, hit us up if you want to go get drinks.

&gt;##6. What internet celebrity would you most like to see do an AMA on your subreddit?
&gt;&gt;**theKingMan**: OAG

&gt;&gt; **Thehealeroftri**: I would love to see TheAmazingAtheist and Bad Luck Brian.

&gt;&gt; **AlbertIInstein**: I have my hopes set too high and came up with a list of the following: Catherine Wayne, crashcourse, zeropunctuation, Jenna Marbles, Justin Bieber, Rebecca Black, Rucka Rucka Ali, and VenetianPrincess. I knows many of these people have done AMA's

&gt;&gt; **NarwhalAnusRape**: Marina Vladimirovna Orlova, come talk to us! Please! 

&gt;&gt; **Onahail**: 5secondfilms, Lloyd Ahlquist, blamesocietyfilms, barelypolitical.

&gt;&gt; **Apostolate**: Gary Brolsma, Jonathan Paula &amp; Jory Caron.

&gt;&gt; **Knowthem**: Epic Meal Time, and ZDoggMD.

&gt;&gt; **daskoon**: If you know any of these people

&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.    
    
&gt;&gt;**All**: We love you subscribers, we're blue. Oh subscribers we love you! Join up, and encourage the Internet famous to drop in and post. Invite your friends. Ask everyone you know to come do an AMA. We want anyone with an ego who thinks they matter on the Internet, even the tiniest bit. Have you ever had 15 seconds of fame? Know somebody that did? We are all about learning what makes you click and and peering inside you to see how you do what you do so well. :) Also, /u/Thehealeroftri could use about tree fiddy.   
    
This is the first SOTD post I've ever created (and hopefully not the last)! Thank you so much to the amazing moderation team here for letting me try my hand at a post
     
**Seriously.** I'll fight you.

Right. So here's the thing. I've never worked in retail. BUT I did work as a front desk clerk at a hotel. And let me tell you

So once there was this lady who was staying at the hotel with her kid. I didn't check her in

Me: Guest Services. How can I help you?

Customer: Ya

M: She's not available right now. Is it something I can help you with?

C: I guess. I just want you to know

M: I'm sorry to hear that ma'am. May I ask why?

C: Ya

M: I'm sorry. Your kid was hit by a car? Is he alright?

C: You're lucky the car wasn't going fast so nothing serious happened. But he did fall and he has cuts and bruises.

M: I'm sorry to hear that. Can I know the time of this incident?

C: How is that even relevant?. Let me talk to the manager!

M: I'll have to look at the cameras to see what exactly happened. Can you please give me the approximate time?

C: I don't have to tell you shit. I'm calling the cops if you dont' give it to your manager.

M: I'm sorry ma'am. I told you she's not available right now.

C: Ugh! If I tell you the time

M: Yes.

C: Fine. I guess it was around 2 in the morning.

Pause.

M: Ok

C: No

M: Oooooook. So your child was in the parking lot by himself at 2 in the morning unsupervised when a car hit him?

C: Yes.

M: And why was your child alone in the parking lot unsupervised at 2 in the morning?

C: What the hell? I don't have to answer shit to you!

M: Ok

And then we never heard from her again.

I think that was the worst suing call I got. And mind you

I don't know what it is about certain customers that make them want to make employees lives so miserable

The worst part about working front desk at a hotel though

Uhhhh...no bitch. We have Tempurpedic mattresses in all our rooms.

""My curtain didn't close all the way.""

Hmmm...maybe that's because you only closed the right side and not the left.

""The light bulb was burnt out. I demand to get our room comp'd""

Oh you're light bulb is out? I'll send maintenance to switch it out right away. Problem solved.

Word of advice to travelers staying in hotels. If you have a problem with the room. I mean a legitimate problem

If it's a hotel with proper customer service

Anyway

&gt;##1. How did /r/talesfromretail come about?

&gt;&gt; I've worked retail for going on....8 years now and about 4 years ago I got a job working at staples. I stumbled across the subreddit /r/talesfromtechsupport and tried to post a few of my stories there... In which they gladly showed me the door telling me my posts weren't meant for that website. So

&gt;##2. Do/did you work in retail?

&gt;&gt; I have worked in retail for almost 8 years. Prior to that I worked in the food industry (waitress, but then there's always that one customer that can just take an amazing day and ruin it with a bad attitude!

&gt;##3. What's your best story? 

&gt;&gt; My best story? Oh god... that's a tough one. My favorite story comes from my boyfriend; who also started at staples the same time I did. One early morning shift he was having a morning ""business meeting"" (Bowel Movement), he smelled this obnoxious odor and thought he had done more damage during that meeting than he thought. He leaves the stall, not making eye contact, and rushes over to wash his hands. Just as he opens the door and goes to step- Poop..... Right....On...The...Floor. The panting man had shat himself. There was a little pile of ""turdlets"", as he calls them, right in the hallway. But it didn't stop there.... the man must have shit himself upwards toward the front of the store and tried to make his way to the bathroom as quickly as possible, because there was a little turd trail leading from our electronics department, then to the bathroom. He told me he walked up to the manager and only said the words ""No F**king way""
But honestly
I hope that story wasn't too graphic

&gt;##4. What are some small things customers can do to make your (and other retail workers) day?

&gt;&gt; I cannot stress this enough- PUT THE MONEY IN MY HAND.... Not on the counter. We will go out of our way to take extra time picking it up. Don't throw your items or money at us

&gt;##5. So sometimes I need help at a store

&gt;##a) say excuse me louder?

&gt;##b) tap you on the shoulder?

&gt;##c) stand behind you until you finally turn around?

&gt;&gt; This is a trick question, just because you never know how someone will react. I might just try repeating yourself and if that doesn't work, go up to the counter and ask for assistance. Which leads me to another great story-
There is a lady who comes into my store once a month, NOW!"". She doesn't even make eye contact with the people as she comes in... just assumes we're going to come to her (which, we do..) then we proceed to shop for her. Yes, we run up to the front and get a cart after addressing her needs, then she gives us some story about her health and why she has to have us take her to every aisle. She complains the entire time about how fast/slow we walk, how we look, EVERYTHING. So when she would come in the store, or take a lunch break. When I'm at my store


&gt;##6.  Another scenario: I see a guy working at a store

&gt;&gt; HAHAHAHA!! Um... I'm not sure... I think I would just start off with subtle conversation... then come in the next few times they're working then find some sleek way to give them your number?

&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; The only thing I'd like to add is a big thanks to all the readers on /r/TalesFromRetail for sharing their stories and living the ""retail dream"" so we can have great stories!",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/x692l/july_26_2012_rtalesfromretail_for_the_love_of_all/

Hi

 As much as she begged and pleaded for me to let her do today's SROTD

Alright enough MiraP talk

 Pop Quiz

----------------------------------------------------

**What’s more awesome than a zombie apocalypse?**

A) An open bar.

B) A trip to another country.

C) Gossip Girl.

D) All of the above.

Answer: E) None of the above (*well maybe A&amp;B while E

--------------------------------------------------------

Admit it, the feeling of freedom within the confines of a zombie paradise. I could go on, but I digress. 

Well

The Walking Dead started off as a comic then was adapted into a television show for AMC. The directors have taken their liberties with the comic series

The cool thing about today’s SROTD is that they have actually gotten in contact with some of the show’s actors and are currently trying to reach out to the rest of the cast (fingers crossed for a T-Dog AMA).


&gt;##1. How were you first introduced to The Walking Dead? Was it the comics or show?

&gt;&gt; **edify**: Myself and my real life best friend [saywhat181](/user/saywhat181) who also moderates on [/r/thewalkingdead](/r/thewalkingdead) are huge fans of Breaking Bad. Thanks to advertising we decided to check the show out and now we get together every Sunday when either Breaking Bad or The Walking Dead airs to watch them live.

&gt;&gt; **Nikondork**: It was the show. I knew about the show when it first began airing but I didn't actually start to watch it until right before the second season started and I was sick with the flu. Watched all of season one in a little over a day. I was hooked.

&gt;&gt; **saywhat181**: I was first introduced by the show

&gt;&gt; **toadkiller**: I was first introduced to The Walking Dead through the TV show. It's kind of a sad story, so I bought and watched the first episode. About 20 minutes in I was totally hooked, bought the entire season and watched it in one solid block. By the time I was done I realized I'd missed New Years (it was 12:30 on January 1st) and had totally forgotten about the party that I had planned to go to. After that I was an addict, and I've read a few of the comics. I need to read them all though.

&gt;&gt;**Rswany**: I first came across the Walking Dead around three years ago. I had just gotten into comics (Mostly X-Men and Deadpool) and this coupled with my lifetime enthusiasm for zombies lead me to the The Walking Dead. I started reading and was immediately hooked. Naturally


&gt;##2. How do you feel about Frank Darabont leaving the show and its effect on the second half of season 2?

&gt;&gt; **w4rf19ht3r**: I think that Frank Darabont leaving reflects mainly the financial issues that the show is experiencing. I honestly have a hard time imagine what AMC was thinking, unfortunately.

&gt;&gt; **edify**: AMC has made a lot of controversial decisions recently. First they fired Darabont. Now they're cutting the budgets of Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead to support Mad Men. When it comes to original series AMC already knew about HBO's mistakes

&gt;&gt; **Nikondork**: Darabont is a great story teller. He and Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale) are close friends. In my opinion

&gt;&gt; **toadkiller**: It's very unfortunate. He brought a lot to the show and made it what it is in the first season. In addition

&gt;&gt; **Rswany**: I think it's too bad that logistical things like this can get in the way of such a great fiction achieving its full potential on the small screen. Arguably


&gt;##3. What is your favorite part of being a mod and your least?

&gt;&gt; **edify**: My favorite thing? That's easy. I organized the AMA with James Allen McCune to take place on [/r/thewalkingdead](/r/thewalkingdead). He refers to me as his friend! Least favorite? We still get complaints even though we've worked really hard to make [/r/thewalkingdead](/r/thewalkingdead) better and have even endorsed spin off subreddits like [/r/TWD](/r/TWD) and [/r/thetalkingdead](/r/thetalkingdead)

&gt;&gt; **Nikondork**: Favorite: Helping the subreddit grow. Least: Removing spoilers.

&gt;&gt; **saywhat181**: It's fun to help run a fairly large sub. My least favorite thing is having to remove things. I don't like to be ""that guy""

&gt;&gt; **toadkiller**: My favorite part of being a mod in [/r/thewalkingdead](/r/thewalkingdead) is that it's just a lot of fun. I absolutely love The Walking Dead and it just gives me something more to do involving the show and comics. Additionally, the host of The Walking Dead's after-show talk show is active in our subreddit. That all comes together to make a really interesting and fun subreddit.

&gt;&gt; **Rswany**: The best part of being a mod is getting to contribute to and improve a community for a topic that you're passionate for. The worst part of being a mod is that it truly is a thankless ""job.""


&gt;##4. What do you have to say to convince people that haven't seen the walking dead to watch an episode or two.

&gt;&gt; **edify**: AMC is making some of the best original series on television these days. Season 1 of The Walking Dead is amazing and it's only 6 episodes long

&gt;&gt; **Nikondork**: Zombies. You like zombies

&gt;&gt; **saywhat181**: Just check it out. It's really well written. AMC has some great original content.

&gt;&gt; **toadkiller**: Do you like zombies? Of course you like zombies

&gt;&gt; **Rswany**: I've never been big on pressuring people. For some people the show just might not be for them whether it be the blood and gore


&gt;##5. Do you prefer the comics to the television show?

&gt;&gt; **edify**: They are very different from one another and I like them both. While the TV show isn't perfect

&gt;&gt; **Nikondork**: Cant really say. I've only watched the show. I have seen various panels from the comics but not enough to decide.

&gt;&gt; **saywhat181**: I like both equally. They're both really awesome

&gt;&gt; **toadkiller**: I might get some hate for this, the comics are still awesome and are one of a very few comics that I actually enjoy (Tintin, anyone?)

&gt;&gt; **Rswany**: I am very biased towards the comics. The comics, there's no Tyrese! He was my favorite character in the comics!

&gt;##6. How does it feel to have people from The Walking Dead actually participate in your subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **edify**: I talked about this earlier. It's amazing! I've made connections I never thought possible before and I think that our users really enjoyed the AMA with James Allen McCune.

&gt;&gt; **Nikondork**: I think it's great! Some of us cant make it to their public appearances. The chance to ask questions in a AMA is a nice alternative

&gt;&gt; **saywhat181**: It's pretty cool. I'm pretty much never around due to being at work when they happen

&gt;&gt; **toadkiller**: It feels amazing. Chris Hardwick especially- the fact that he chimes in on discussions and tries to get our reader's questions answered on Talking Dead occasionally is really

&gt;&gt; **Rswany**: While Edify has handled most of these interaction, or even Rober Kirkman(the creator) himself.


&gt;##7. Last question

&gt;&gt; **w4rf19ht3r**: Left 4 Dead 2

&gt;&gt; **edify**: Zombies Ate My Neighbors

&gt;&gt; **Nikondork**: Resident Evil 2

&gt;&gt; **saywhat181**: Does Minecraft count? There are zombies in it...

&gt;&gt; **toadkiller**: Gonna have to go with Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare. That game is a lot of fun.

&gt;&gt; **BauerUK**: Left 4 Dead (the first one)

&gt;&gt; **Rswany**: Resident Evil 4

The way I see it, and find myself with a constant background noise. I'm currently accompanied by Intermezzo in A Minor, a fine piece indeed. But for some, the classical genius of Brahms is not enough. No, they need something more. For some people, music created from the soundtrack that handles itself with pastel-colored ponies is ideal. Indeed, these are wise people indeed.

I don't hide the fact that I'm a brony. In fact I find myself replacing words in drawn-out conversation to see if anyone notices. Discussing the local flora is fine material on its own, but because of an obligation to what I believe this subreddit is all about. Jet-lagged and tired, I am writing this to inform and to entertain you all on this small subreddit with a grand purpose. And that purpose is to rock.

I took some time aside to speak with the moderators of /r/MLPtunes and get their answers on questions, and enjoy the fine sounds of /r/MLPTunes.

&gt;#1. Firstly

&gt;&gt;**frkygp** My name is frkygp. I started this sub about a year ago because I was tired of having to search around the main sub for all the amazing fan music and I wanted a way to give newer

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** Well I joined the /r/MLPTunes team a while back in order to do the CSS for the subreddit and give it a much-needed ponification. I also manage the subreddit's automated Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/MLPTunes.

&gt;#2. MLPTunes is certainly an interesting subreddit. Manly men mixing musical material. How would you describe MLPTunes to the uninitiated?

&gt;&gt;**frkygp** MLPtunes is a place for music and ponies

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** It's a subreddit for music created from or inspired by My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic

&gt;#3. You knew I'd ask. What is your favorite remix?

&gt;&gt;**frkygp** Besides my own (haha) probably 20% Cooler by Ken Ashcorp. Even though that isn't technically a remix it's still one of my favorite songs from the fandom.

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** Either Spin That Record Vinyl Scratch -by- KeepOnRockin' or SimGretina's This Day Aria remix. Although the recent Raise this Barn remix by DJ Gestap is up there as well.

&gt;#4. What's your own histories with music remixing? How's about MLP remixing?

&gt;&gt;**frkygp** MLP was actually the reason I started making music in the first place. I always wanted to get into it but for some reason this show was enough of a push to make me get started. Since then I've made some awesome friends and learned a LOT about music production.

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** Well not terribly much of a remixer

&gt;#5. MLPTunes is going great. It's all potatoes and cream in the world of reddit. What now? Where will you go with your new-found ~~fame and fortune~~ slight increase in viewership?

&gt;&gt;**frkygp** Probably doing the same thing we always do ~~try and take over the world~~ keep making and listening to awesome music. This is also a good time to plug the fact that we have our 3000th subscriber music contest going on! So head on over to the sub and check it out!

**7

I find it impossible to believe that the alcoholic mods of this sub haven't featured the subreddit about their favorite beverage, only beer.

This holy land of beer subreddits is r/BeerPorn, I think we've found your dream car!), and [awesome growlers with the The Dude on them](http://i.imgur.com/FTBcu.jpg). Needless to say, this is the subreddit of my alchy dreams!

But there's more to r/BeerPorn than drooling over high end beers and day dreaming of how fucked up you're going to get after drinking them all at once after work. No

One of the mods of /r/BeerPorn, as well as an amusing anecdote about a drunken and pants-less night!

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create /r/beerporn?

&gt;&gt; /r/beerporn was created at a time when /r/beer was overrun with submissions of popular beer pictures. I believe Goatbnnn created it in response to one of the many discussions/complaint threads on the topic. 

&gt;&gt;However, if I recall correctly (and my memory is pretty awful). Around that time, I asked to become a mod in order to help with the increased activity and provide some continuity of modding between the subreddits.

&gt;##2. What's your favorite beer and why?

&gt;&gt;The beer in my glass. 

&gt;&gt;I love trying beer, reviewing it, etc. I find the stuff fascinating, particularly for its range of flavor. 

&gt;&gt;That doesn't mean that I like every beer. Far from it

&gt;&gt;That sounds pretty fucking pretentious

&gt;&gt;For less of a cop-out answer

&gt;##3. How did you develop a taste for quality beers? Do you still indulge in budget beers from time to time?

&gt;&gt; I started slow

&gt;&gt;My first regular quality beers were Stone's Ruination and Shipyard's Old Thumper

&gt;&gt;After that

&gt;&gt;I very rarely drink cheap lagers. I probably haven't had one in a couple years

&gt;&gt;Since I blow the vast majority of the fun stuff portion of my budget on booze

&gt;##4. Describe your ""perfect beer"" in 3 words or less.

&gt;&gt; Pliny the Elder. 

&gt;&gt;Sorta kidding - Pliny is the default beer for my footer image borrowed from the brave souls at circlejerk. It would really depend on style and whatnot. There's no perfect beer.

&gt;##5. Alright

&gt;&gt;I'd recommend seeking out a good local brewpub or brewery tasting room (check beeradvocate/ratebeer for reviews) and get yourself a sampler tray. That will expose you to a range of beers in an ideal setting. Then

&gt;&gt;Also, I would recommend reading the r/beer guide.

&gt;##6.  In your opinion

&gt;&gt; Probably HopSlam

&gt;&gt;I only mean that in terms of my opinion compared to the general consensus, only has meaning in that sense. And with that caveat out of the way, I'll piss some more people off and pick Dogfish Head and Ninkasi as the most overrated breweries.

&gt;&gt;I think lots of beers deserve more attention. There are way, so I won't harp on the lack of British cask ales, Central European lagers and such. Plus, most submissions are made of bottled beer, and I can understand the reasons for that. That said, a lot of classic American craft beers tend to get overlooked in favor of newer stuff, and that's sort of a shame.

&gt;&gt;Anyway, everything Lawson's, Double Mountain (probably more unknown than underrated, really), Anchor Porter and Old Foghorn, Dupont Avril, various beers from Nils Oscar, Southampton Grand Cru, GI Matilda

&gt;##7. What's the strangest beer you've tried

&gt;&gt; I've tried a fair number of oddball beers. The first to come to mind is The Bruery's Dirty Beaver Juice Weekend, but it was a very odd combination. 

&gt;&gt;The bright green Magic Ghost from Fantome probably wins for looks. A local brewpub, which was pretty strange. Beer has such a huge range of potential flavors, ingredients, etc., so those are really the most personally surprising. There are a lot of beers that sound odder than they actually taste and beers that taste odd but aren't really a surprise after awhile, if that makes sense.

&gt;##8. Any tales of drunken antics that you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;I wouldn't mind

&gt;##9. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Lots

&gt;&gt;At beer bars, etc., I see almost nothing but good cheer and camaraderie amongst beer geeks or, really, anyone at all interested in good beer. Online, people invent reasons to argue. Of course, that problem is endemic to online discussion. I just find it particularly disappointing in the beer community because it tends to be particularly welcoming in real life.

The study of language allows us a great deal of insight into the human condition and our nature as a species writ large. Because language permeates our society in such a deep way

Language is itself a fluid concept. It isn't stagant and can undergo almost indefinite cycles of change, use a sound to represent said object and then get another person to understand that sound or gesture or symbol as your thought and your feelings and your ideas. We are an animal that can take what is in our heads; in a conceptual space, and actualize it in reality. More over, we are able to communicate these systems of complex thoughts and ideas through a structure of mutually understood symbols.

I am beginning to take full financial responsibility of myself and it feels great. It's an issue of independence; and it's even more enjoyable than I imagined. 

After a few years time, you know? Little blood and sweat for your ass. :p 

I was listening to NPR in my car on the way to work this morning and they were talking about the growing trend among young 20-somethings to live minimal lives. And when I say minimal I mean pretty bare bones. 
Currently, I am *encouraged* to just want/need less stuff. I choose which clothes I want and toss the rest. I have only a few boxes worth of possessions and could up and out of the country in a few months time.

We'll see what happens though

Just over a month ago, frisson?  Not to be confused with the *pee shivers* or *poophoria* - totally different things.

Today we explore a community based around a similar concept - music that speaks to the soul and lets the body act accordingly.  Where frisson had a larger approach (all forms of artistic production), relax or chill, hyper energetic, fight or flight, soothing, it's all there!

Let's visit /r/futurebeats in today's Subreddit Breakdown!

* futurebeats is the place where experimental beat music gets all the attention.  Maybe some of the artists are well known
* what I find most interesting is how easy it is for the music on futurebeats to get right to your core.  Sure, it's not what Thom Yorke sings about, but it's the way he uses his voice as an instrument.  The stuff on futurebeats does this really well - music that gets inside you and demands an emotional or physical response.
* finally, new instrumental sounds that often don't follow conventional scales or keys. The result is mixed, some hits, some misses, but never a predictable formulaic tune.  It's the cure for those bored with music!

We salute /r/futurebeats for their contribution to reddit.com, whoosh, thump thump, bweeep at a time.  For over 2 years this place has been providing excellent creative music to redditors.  The moderators work very hard to foster a supportive environment and by the large number of submissions and subscriptions, I'd say they're doing a great job.  For some redditors, *this is the their favourite subreddit...* so let's allow the modteam explain it all!

&gt;How is futurebeats different from /r/electronicmusic

&gt;&gt;FRONTCANNON:  Our All-Time top post is porn, which left the people who were more into the darker, 'dubbier' and experimental sounds of dubstep without a subreddit to post their Electronic bass music to. r/futuregarage was created because of similar reasons, so r/fb and r/fg are basically sister subreddits. 

&gt;&gt;r/futurebeats in general works as a catch-all subreddit for 'experimental and forward-thinking beat music', the oddball tunes of Electronic music, no matter when or where they're from. At first this meant mainly what came out of the UK (see r/futuregarage), but with the rising popularity of this beat music we now get stuff from bedroom producers all over the world, the absolutely huge LA bass scene, Japan, you name it :D 

&gt;&gt;By refusing to limit us to one genre, that is). This has made us many people's favourite subreddit, introducing people to music and tunes they've never even knew were a thing. I've heard futurebeats being described as 'electronic nerd music', when the normal stuff gets to formulaic or anything that just about even has a formula doesn't do it anymore ;) I've been on here for a little less than 2 years now and r/fb remains my primary source of new music, though the times that I could check out every single tune on here are long gone. We mods try to keep the quality up, I do a monthly Mix Series where we feature the community's favourite tunes of that month (including some personal tunes here and there) and the community feedback has been overwhelmingly good (we sometimes get modmail with people thanking us just for the subreddit, which is awesome, message your mods from time to time

&gt;&gt;SICKLAUGHTER:  I come to the style of futurebeats music through an adoration of hip hop which led my ears to eclectic beatmakers such as Dibiase, if one takes an aerial perspective, you find that the loosely defined genre of ""futurebeats"" is a full on collision of many different styles. Multiple roads of musical evolution crashing headlong into one another and getting lost amidst a dense spider webbish spaghetti junction of beat experimenation. This gives it a very diverse fan base as well as sonic output. You can hear all manner of genre bending aural experimentations under the ""futurebeats"" umbrella. Which is awesome.

&gt;&gt;THE_MUSIC_DIRECTOR:  r/futurebeats is great because it's not genre specific. It celebrates that ""future state of mind, [Cannibal Ox - Scream Pheonix (2001)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HXpqYMQ5l4), and [Hudson Mohawke - Thunder Bay (2011)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvKAr9qaI1I). All of these songs are from different genres and time periods, but they are all rhythmic and experimental, and thus are welcomed in r/futurebeats. In fact, r/futurebeats is the only music subreddit I even subscribe to besides r/futurepopmusic, and this is because it encompasses so much more.

&gt;&gt;SIRMARCUS:  We’ve got the tagline “Experimental beat music”, I tried to get into “experimental music” but found it hard to stay entertained. The genius of futurebeats is adding “beats” to the idea of “experimental music”, which leaves you with the magic of “unique fun music”, a line you can sell to anyone.

&gt;What are your favorite ""futurebeat"" tracks or artists? What posts from the sub are your favorite?

&gt;&gt;FRONTCANNON:  Well, so here goes (I'll try to use some very different tunes to showcase the variety I spoke of):
[Gramatik - The Drink Is Called Rakija](http://redd.it/ix9dg) You can definitely hear the HipHop influence here, plus the second drop is just absolutely nuts. The album is free, go grab it!     
[Teebs - Verbena Tea (feat. Rebekah Raff)](http://redd.it/mg59b) This tune includes many 'typical' futurebeats attributes. Very hazy, a kick with lots of syncopation and a good low-end (bass). This on good headphones = bliss.       
[Kuedo - Glow (Clark Remix)](http://redd.it/ihebe)  This tune perfectly showcases what I mean by experimental and forward-thinking. I doesn't even have a beat, I'll be sure the other mods will introduce you to some of them :)

&gt;&gt;SICKLAUGHTER:  There are so many amazing artists out there, [Shigeto](http://redd.it/miyxx) and this cat [Amai](http://amai.bandcamp.com/track/sun-among-midori).

&gt;&gt;KLITZKRIEG: One of my main pet projects for r/FUTUREbeats is to broaden awareness of where to find new music and how to support. That is why when I submit a link I always make a point to mention when an album is coming out and on what label. Posts to a typical music subreddit are simply a YouTube link of a song ripped from someone’s album. To keep our community from falling into a repost circle jerk we need to share more than just the song and title. We need to share how to get more. That’s why I started the [favorite sources of music.](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/futurebeats) The community has submitted their favorite record labels

&gt;&gt; I could list favorites for days but I have to refer to our [TWO YEAR anniversary self.post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/s9r58/rfuturebeats_just_turned_two_and_we_want_cakeday/) We asked our community to join us in a celebration of two great years of FUTUREbeats by posting THEIR favorites from the archives. They showed up in style and droves. Almost every track and artist on there is a favorite of mine.

&gt;&gt;SIRMARCUS:  I’m going to keep this simple and go with the very first “futurebeats” song I ever heard that made me who I am today

&gt;Are you involved in music in ""real life""? What do you do

&gt;&gt;FRONTCANNON:  I'm a DJ and just got started in production of Electronic Music, too. I'm also a drummer which may explain my focus and bass and beat music :D Regarding personal life, I'm a 19-year old dude from Germany who just got done with school and is now looking into getting into university for winter. I absolutely love introducing people to music, seeking out music (my friends even call my music 'Frontcannon-music') and listening to music. You generally never see me without my ATH-M50s on... If you want to get into Futurebeats, [my Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/Frontcannon/) has often proven to be a good starting point. Get digging, and thanks for the feature!

&gt;&gt;THE_MUSIC_DIRECTOR:  I am pretty involved with music, it was supporting artists, listening to music, and really being a part of the atmosphere. I became a music director and DJ at a pretty well known college radio station for the past 3 years (that's the reason for my username) which allowed me to meet a lot of artists, get underground music before it comes out, and a bunch of other cool perks. College radio stations are the only radio stations where you'll hear this great music on the radio, so support them (sorry for the plug). I have, in the last three weeks

&gt;&gt;KLITZKRIEG:  I fall on the side of a curator of music vs. creating it. I geek out on finding new music that sounds different from anything I’ve heard previously. Then I share it with others online or in person but never from a DJ booth.

&gt;&gt;SIRMARCUS:  Very much so, where futurebeats/futurepop is the main hype of the world. We have been getting real world artists to put themselves as artists in the 2044 world and it’s so much fun. We are currently turning it into an animation and live-show series and so far some of the bigger artists on board are of Tokimonsta and Sonnymoon. I can’t tease much more but if you stick around these parts of the web I’m sure you’ll find out more soon :D.

“OOOOOOH KNAGA Y DA FAK R U FETURIN AN AUSTRALIAN SUBREDIT ITZ DA 4TH AF JULY!!!!” Whoa

If you’re a Strayan cunt (you fucking should be), don’t get fucking mad at the truth! What’s that, cunt? Don’t like our fucking use of language? Well the next time I see you I’m gonna bloody bail you up, so watch out, cunt. You gonna knock our fucking country? Rack off to your own bloody country, cunt. Why don’t you have a fucking naughty, huh cunt? Wouldn’t cracking a fat make ya fucking feel better? I’m sure it would

You seppos think the 4th is all about you, and let me tell ya something. Just because the 4th of July is celebrating you seppos doesn’t mean we Strayans go unnoticed. You cunts think that /r/MURICA was gonna be fucking featured today, huh cunt? Well, we’re not fucking taking it anymore. We need attention today too, cunt! We Strayans are taking a fucking stand, cunt! THE 4TH OF JULY WILL BE OUR BLOODY DAY NOW CUNTS! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!

Ahem, enough swearing and Aussie slang, let’s get serious. I don’t know about other Aussies, but I feel my country gets left out on the 4th. It’s all about eagles, red and white stripes, and freedom. I want to spend my day without that American stuff, I want to have a pint with my mates, but just remember, but I wanted to do something different. So Americans

&gt;##1. What made you create/moderate /r/straya
&gt;&gt;**/u/thesearmsshootlasers** When an Australian redditor encounters stereotypes about Australians on reddit they seem to get really defensive or dismiss the joke as not funny. I can sort of see where they are coming from, coupled with the overly serious and political nature of /r/australia was why this subreddit was created. A place to celebrate and lampoon the stereotypes and generalisations we've managed to cultivate as a people. We aren't necessarily trying to promote the sort of behaviour you might see on here, but to be honest Strayans can be piss funny bogans and that sort of stuff deserves recognition.

&gt;##2. Give us a taste of Strayan life.
&gt;&gt;**thesearmsshootlasers** The real Australia is a beautiful and varied place, such as fighting kangaroos, chopping the springs on your sick ute to get it low as brah, wearing an Australian flag as a cape, cheering when a fight breaks out in a footy match, beating the poms at sports, grabbing a kebab at 3 am after a ripper night out, but other particular beverages are also acceptable) and to love your country.

&gt;##3. How often do you cunts use the word ""cunt"" on a daily basis?
&gt;&gt;**thesearmsshootlasers** ""Cunt"" is an old and versatile word that has been adopted into the Strayan vernacular as a stand in for just about any pupose. As such, and you can't just force a ""cunt"" on to the end of sentence because you've realised you forgot to squeeze one in somewhere. Strayans will immediately recognise you for the fraud you are. The word can be and often is a term of endearment (""Cheers, cunt"", or ""what a mad cunt"") but can also be fighting words. Inflection is everything. When in doubt assume that it has been used kindly.

&gt;&gt; When not in character I barely use it. It's kind of fucking rude and since I'm in Hong Kong at the moment not at all appropriate.

&gt;##4. What bloody footy team do you cunts go for?
&gt;&gt;**thesearmsshootlasers** As a proud New South Welshman I support the great game of rugby league, whilst Victorians and everyone else will follow Australian Rules Football. There are exceptions (both NSW and Queensland have a couple of Australian Rules teams) and soccer is making inroads, but that shit is unAustralian (except when we get in the world cup then it's every cunt on board the bandwagon).

&gt;##5. Are you cunts proud /r/MURICA is not featured today?
&gt;&gt;**thesearmsshootlasers** I'm not sure proud is the right word

&gt;##6. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt;**thesearmsshootlasers** Thanks for contributing

&gt;##7. Anything to say to the bloody seppos?
&gt;&gt;**thesearmsshootlasers** Tough luck

I put /r/MURICA out of the fucking spotlight, out.

I own a *lot* of games.  No, really - I buy games when they're on sale.  Then they just sit.  I partially blame /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame for that.  There are so many good games recommended.  Sure, it varies from person to person as to whether or not a game is good or enjoyable - but hearing from others who have played it certainly helps in the decision process.  It helps narrow down which game in a series to get, for example.  You read enough of these posts, and eventually you'll end up with a collection of games that are eternally on your ""to play"" list.  One of these days, I'll get to you.  Don't worry.

&gt;&gt;**Broodje**:  It's fairly simple and straight to the point. Surely enough you've heard people talk about that one great new game or you laid your eyes on a great cover in a game store



&gt;How do I know which games to buy?


&gt;&gt;**TriAft**:  Exactly. How do you know what games to buy? How can you tell what to buy in a world where there are so many good games and so little time to play all of them? And that's where we come in. It's our job to point you in the right direction of the great games and steer you clear of the bad ones. All you have to do it ask and we'll light the way.

&gt;&gt;**attackzac21**Try and pick what genre suits you best. If you don't know what genre suits you best then it's best to start trying all of them.  Wanna try an RPG?  Skyrim, fallout.
Wanna try an RTS? Starcraft
How about an FPS? Call of duty, Crysis, Tribes etc.

&gt;&gt;**Broodje**:Well, no biased opinions and a voice of dissent telling you why you shouldn't buy that particular game.


&gt;Why are some users gamers of the week?

&gt;&gt;**TriAft**:  Some users stand out. Some put in that extra effort to make a helpful comment that's 5 paragraphs long. Some come on every day and make countless helpful recommendations that influence users in the best way. Some are so persuasive that they'll respond three, just for the sake of being nice. These are the people that deserve recognition for being stellar at being a gamer. These are the Gamers of the Week.

&gt;&gt;**attackzac21**Mostly to encourage quality posts. I might start giving out games to some of the ""overall heroes"".

&gt;&gt;**Broodje**:  We take our time to read threads carefully and voice in ourselves from time to time. Surely there are more people that tend to give their opinion on certain games



&gt;What makes ShouldIBuyThisGame great?

&gt;&gt;**TriAft**:  The thing that makes this subreddit great is that there are thousands of people from all around the world that can give you advice based on personal experience. A review from a website might be biased and a video could not answer the questions you are looking for

&gt;&gt;**Broodje**:  There are a lot of things that bigger subreddits do that this subreddit tries to avoid. First of all, but the goal is to give/get advice from the community. Everyone is aware of that and that is what makes this reddit so special.



&gt;What are the popular games people want to buy now? [or what would you

&gt;&gt;**TriAft**:  A lot of people have been asking about the Half-Life series recently and one of our most popular recommendations has been about Bastion. But my favorite game of all time is Bioshock so I'd have to recommend that.


&gt;&gt;**attackzac21**Well a lot of people seem to be asking SIB half life, the witcher 2 because it is one of the best RPGs of this generation (up there with KOTOR and baulders gate imo), crysis 1/2 because of their hilariously powerful graphics engine, arma 2 mainly because of DayZ (although regular arma 2 with the ACE mod is great fun), spec ops the line for it's disturbingly engaging storyline, metro 2033 for it's-... you know I could go on forever.

&gt;&gt;**Broodje**Hah, if steam decides to put fallout on sale, fallout will be popular. But the games that generate the most threads out there are Half Life, Bioshock, Arma II (DayZ basically :D), and popular indie games such as Bastion.

&gt;&gt;Games I would recommend? (Hah, HoN is kinda similar to League of Legends. I'm not the one to judge LoL, but I just prefer HoN. The only problem I'm having with the game is the learning curve for new players, it's pretty tough..


&gt;What should I do with the games once I buy them?

&gt;&gt;**TriAft**:  You should cover them with pepper, and a nice maple glaze before putting them in the oven at 365° F until they turn golden brown. Then pour a nice ham gravy on it and serve while hot.

&gt;&gt;**attackzac21**:  god. Don't put hot sauce on video games. Especially RPGs. Honestly I would recommend a nice sweet BBQ sauce with +15 vit and +3 (only applies if wizard)

&gt;&gt;**attackzac21**:  Well the obvious answer is play them. If you really really like it then you can say YSB: ---- and recommend other people to the title.

&gt;&gt;**Broodje**:  Give them a loving home

More often than I would have ever imagined, subreddits are pretty cool but what about some sick pornography once in a while?!   Overweight hairy bastards who you can smell through the monitor who give up half way through the debaucherous act due to chest pains and adult onset diabetes?  Why hasn't THAT crossed my desk?  Dear subredditoftheday, here's a heavy set woman of colour bringin' the noise at a luncheon for retired chartered accountants.   ""Yeah, thanks for sending that,""  said none of our reproductive organs.  Sometimes I wonder if anyone even likes us.

Case in point

****

Civcraft is a Minecraft server I discovered about two months ago

Civcraft is a politically inclined simulation in a world of attempted scarcity. People build and form socieites based on their political views; be them socialist

On this server, one must reinforce it with materials.

From this system, alliances are forms, and wars are declared. It's roleplay, without the roleplay; people aren't playing roles... they're living the roles.

The in-game economy is also totally player controlled. People sell and buy items via automated shops, and I've ingrained myself in the community quite a bit.

If you were to select the subreddit

I mean... I don't really know what else to tell you guys, even the criminals are brilliant in their execution. I think it would make a fine Subreddit of the Day.

We could really do with the publicity; we're in a bit of a tizz right now because Minecraft as a game is moving in a direction we don't want it too
So we're desperately hoping for minecraft to implement multithreading, and long story short... it costs money. hardware, software dev, it all costs big bux, and big bux comes from kind people's support, and people arrive via publicity.

****

Interested and slightly confused?  That's how I felt until I got a chance to sit down and go one-on-one with /u/TTK2.  Here's the man himself explaining it in full detail.

&gt;Can you explain /r/Civcraft?

&gt;&gt;Civcraft is an experiment for communities, not fiction. We’re forming a new direction for game-play, not just about surviving the elements, but about surviving each other, where players can work together to create and shape civilization or to watch it crumble. A world open to any idea, manifesto or philosophy, created by the players. We hope to push minecraft to it’s fullest potential in order to foster discussion

&gt;What makes this ""unlike anything ever experienced before in videogaming.""

&gt;&gt;Civcraft is an experiment in much more than just one way with each new idea overlapping to make a different one possible. Its taking [emergent gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_gameplay) to a whole new level by fundamentally rethinking how online gaming should be organized. Instead of breaking the community into two groups, this is a fact that Civcraft embraces for its purpose as a social experiment. Here it is up for the players to create order or fail and fall into chaos, instead of banning thieves or murderers it is up to the players to stop them.

&gt;Who does this appeal to? What audience are you targeting?

&gt;&gt;This ties into question 2

&gt;Let's talk vision. What's the future look like and how do you get there? How can we help?!

&gt;&gt;Our dream is to turn Civcraft into a complex MMO where players must organize to gather resources, next is balancing resources and the environment so that players must not only work together to enforce order, but also to even survive in the first place. We are in need of monetary support to help us by a better server. Even though we are just beginning to create Civcraft we still have far more than the 110 players we can handle at peak hours. We are also in need of programming assistance, almost every step we take we blaze a new trail and have to design custom plugins and tools to do things never before considered, we are stretched thin in that regard.

&gt;Anything I've missed?

&gt;&gt;Civcraft is an educational tool. Not designed to teach one subject or one set of ideas, actions limited to a formula designed by the creators, here they are free to create anything they dream of. It is not important what specific ideas players learn from Civcraft, what is important is that they learn to see the real world the same way as they saw the game world. As a world open to any idea, manifesto, or philosophy, created by them.

A community for **3 years** with **41

Quick shout-out to everyone's favourite (or at least,000 readers! It has been a long and arousing journey, but at last we have reached the promised land of 30-thousand-hood. So thanks to everyone who reads, subscribes, recommends or gets featured; it's a lot of fun to be a part of, and for a sub of this size there is an incredibly low level of butthurt or aggro. Also, only about 1000 more to go and we overtake our sworn rival, so bring all your friends!

It's a personal, classical, dance, electro-pop/southern hip-hop. W/E. You're bopping along there being smooth and jazzy with what sounds like a saxophone when all of a sudden the sound itself takes a quick yet undefinable turn and suddenly its Paul McCartney yodeling Spanish. Yeah, actually making a synthetic Paul McCartney would be trickier than rockin' a rhyme, but it can be done, and some day we will power across that uncanny valley and set up our tents on the hills of ""what did they do in the old days?"". Of course, and acoustic music probably wont disappear when the skynet orchestra starts up

SO! /r/electronicmusic. Its a great, futuristic pan-musical utopia, it is a reliable source of everything EDM, from [Daft Punk](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/rmi37/daft_punk_veridis_quo/) to [Aphex Twin](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/thfwl/aphex_twin_flim/), and [beyond](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/i6f7o/this_guy_has_talent/).

Here is mod superstar **sassanix** to further your musical education:

&gt;## Can you define /r/electronicmusic for us

&gt;&gt; The style of music varies a lot on /r/electronicmusic. The members's taste is very complicated. Since it's electronic music it's an umbrella for all the electronic music genres. The members submit tunes they like and sometimes discussions and rants about the genres/festivals and djs could be seen. There are no boundaries
Here are some of the tunes that one might enjoy (at least I enjoyed them) if you're into the more intelligent style of electronic music:

&gt;&gt; Boards Of Canada: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNE7eZdFRyg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p4HmyVr2Bo

&gt;&gt; Tycho: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9ep6YINlWcI

&gt;&gt;Birdy Nam Nam: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEsOtX_DuZM

&gt;## What kind of stuff are you personally into? Do any mixing yourself?

&gt;&gt; When I was a teenager I would listen to hardstyle and trance. Now a days I listen to everything from liquid, complextro, dubstep, prog house, trance, house, future garage and chilout/ambient. I could go on...
But my two favourite genres of all time since the begining of time will have to be Progressive House and Trance. My first love will be trance since 1999 as I got hooked by listening to PVD and ATB.
I also mix my favourite tunes in some of the electronic music genres that I enjoy and it can be listened to on http://www.mixcloud.com/sassanix/


&gt;&gt;**Prog House:**

&gt;&gt;Currently in progressive house I enjoy Kobana
Another tune I enjoyed a lot recently was a remix by [Nigel Good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3UCLFaxUb8) also in progressive house.
SNR recently made this new tune called [+ You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl64Y6czJHU&amp;feature=player_detailpage) that gives me goosebumps as well which I highly recommend everyone to listen to.

&gt;&gt;**Trance:**

&gt;&gt;I enjoy all the sub genres that goes into trance and recently my favourite new producer is Aimoon
Another one is Magnus which recently I've seen more of in the trance scene
If you're into something harder I would check out the newer Tech Trance artists such as [Husman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zj5F8ir-6w&amp;feature=player_detailpage)
For the other sub-genres I don't want to take up much space but I listen to a lot of the bassy and chill stuff. I pretty much enjoy everything that has a nice melody to it and makes me feel some form of emotion :)

&gt;## Anything else?

&gt;&gt;  I want to thank all the members on /r/electronicmusic for contributing content for the past 3 years. This subreddit belongs to many and not the moderators as we're there to just keep things tidy.
Because of you I broadened my taste in the music and I love you all. You guys are some of the most misunderstood group in the music industry and through the internet we've come together to share our passion and to connect with those that also feel the same way.

Birds

Especially eagles

As I’m writing this feature, I was like “Interesting...” Then I look at 3 of the pictures on that sub, and HOLY FUCK. I mean, a subreddit this awesome... I never thought it was even possible! This subreddit is full of win, win, win, win and win.

How did I not come across /r/ArmedBirds sooner? Was I just staying on the safe side of the internet the whole time? 

I literally cannot explain how amazing this subreddit is. I mean

... Dude... This subreddit is every redditors dream! If you don’t like badass birds holding guns and shit

IRONY TIME! I actually had a dream one time that a bald eagle swooped in my office, and looked at me for a little bit. All of a sudden he went from confused to BOSS mode and shot EVERYONE in the office except me. He then grabbed me with his claws on both shoulders and flew me out of the office. Somewhere around a minute flying he dropped me and I died. Evil? Yes. Badass? You betya. 

&gt;##1. Why did you create /r/ArmedBirds?
&gt;&gt; **/u/wanderso24** ArmedBirds was created because people were posting that type of content in /r/birdswitharms. They meant arms as in human arms

&gt;##2. On a scale of 1 to 10
&gt;&gt; **wanderso24** 58

&gt;## 3. Have you had any real life experiences with these armed birds? If not
&gt;&gt; **wanderso24** I have yet to meet a bird with any real firepower, are good birds...good birds with guns.

&gt;##4. Would you kill to be a eagle with a machine gun that kills anyone at will?
&gt;&gt; **wanderso24**  I would. Only I wouldn't kill an eagle. 

&gt;##5. Anything to say to your sexy readers?
&gt;&gt; **wanderso24** Dear Sexy Readers

&gt;&gt; **/u/bolgrot** First, terrible sense of humor, and general weirdness. If it weren't for their willingness to take time out of their busy days to look at photoshopped pictures birds, this subreddit wouldn't being receiving its well-deserved recognition. Next, I'd like to thank /r/birdswitharms for providing the inspiration for such a bad pun (even though they won't add a link on their sidebar to /r/birdswitharms). Finally, I'd like to take the chance to promote an even weirder subreddit, /r/funnyfartstories, like /r/ArmedBirds

Have you ever noticed... the decay of respect we give to doctors? I'm serious here. Now a days when I go to my doc, where people would look up to them. They were like, heroes with stethoscopes and white cape like lab coats. Man, even my grandfather, GrappaSpider, who is known to excessively sprinkle foul language in everything he says; that is except when he was talking to a doctor. Shit got real son. Real quick. Respect was given by the pound fold. Nothing but the facts and time of events where ever told to his doctor. And the same was true with his doctor's recommendations and prescriptions. It was a real business transaction if I ever saw one.

Back in 50 shades of brown aka wild wild west aka most of Asia. Most parents still want their kids to either be doctors or engineers. Notice how doctors comes first. There is a reason. Helping humanity brings respect and cash money

Scrubs... undoes everything.

This hit TV show focused on *medical comedy* first came on the air back in 2001 and ~~its still on the air~~ it ended in 2010. I'm telling you the first 3 ~ 4 seasons were so well written I was astonished national broadcast tv could be this good. The fact that you get emotionally attached to soo many character its sorta scary. And to further add insult to injury

Its not a coincidence

Also don't forget to go to /r/scrubsmemes for all your meme + scrubs related needs.


&gt;1 How did you get into Scrubs? And why do you love it so much?

&gt;&gt;**remlap** I was watching Malcolm in the Middle on Sky One and noticed a promo for it on SKY One here in the UK

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle** When Comedy Central first started showing Scrubs re-runs I finally had a chance to give the show a go. When it first started I was just beginning college and was too busy fraternizing with co-eds to watch any TV. By the time re-runs began and a few seasons before the show ended I finally got wind of it. It became a daily ritual to watch the two a day episodes and I quickly got up to speed on the show. I completely fell in love.

&gt;2 Whats your Favorite episode / clip?

&gt;&gt;**remlap** My favourite episode is My Old Lady

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle** Fav episode: My Lunch. It made me have a brief dive into ""The Fray"". To this day when that scene happens I joke ""NO DR. COX. NO!!!!!"" Favorite clip. There are so many

&gt;3 Who is your favorite character? Why? Who do you love to hate? Why?

&gt;&gt;**remlap** My favourite character is Bob Kelso. Ken Jenkins has the fantastic ability to change from a nice guy to hard ass within a blind of an eye

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle** Favorite character is a tough one. I am going to go with Turk since he was probably the most consistent in terms of character while others went in and out for me. He is a funny character

&gt;4 Now that the series is over

&gt;&gt;**remlap** Well the show has been over before the sub-reddit was created yet continues to grow

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle** Mainly sharing scenes we all love

&gt;5Tell us about your community! / Open mic etc etc.

&gt;&gt;**remlap** Just wanted to say thanks for everyone who's submitted

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle** I love our little community and what it shares with each other. It's just a fun place to visit to brighten your mood if your a Scrubs fan. Some of the same stuff gets posted over and over

Have you ever wanted to be a moderator? Perhaps you created a subreddit but have no idea what you are doing. Enter /r/NeedAMod. This subreddit acts like part classified ad

Moderating is an integral part of reddit, often simply by showing interest in the subreddit and being available. Some moderators have great ability with scripts and css (cascading style sheets) but many have no computer skills beyond [the ability to navigate to reddit.](http://i.imgur.com/ouibgwH.gif) 

All mods share a common trait; they were interested in the subject matter of the community they help to moderate at some point. This might not seem like sufficient cause to become a mod, promoting the community, and making decisions (sometimes unpopular ones) regarding content all fall into the scope of a moderator's duties. There are many reddit personalities who are famous (or infamous) for being mods, and while being a squeaky clean moderator can be very rewarding, more than a few wind up on the frontpage of subredditdrama. 

Each subreddit's mod team will have a different way of interacting with their community. Some are in constant communication, lest they run afoul of the hivemind. 

Recently this subreddit has seen a flurry of activity. I spoke with the very polite and helpful /r/needamod moderators to learn more about interesting community and where it is headed:

&gt;1) /r/Needamod has a very interesting concept. Please describe the idea behind the sub and how your vision has translated into its current form.

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** The idea behind it is pretty straightforward

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** First, and that is telling of how an essential human component of reddit has struggled to grow along with the site. This is not an administrative issue, it's a debt that must be paid by the users of reddit.

&gt;&gt;**bep:** It was when all the other modhelp subs were started to come into fashion that I decided to start this sub. I thought, deals done in the dark rooms behind the alleys of the mail. We didn't have modmail back then, you know. It was all very confusing, a veritable chaotic confusion of moderating. Quite different from today.

&gt;2) Do you see this as a place which will develop a community or it is more of a transactive subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** I see it as more of a utility subreddit. I'm sure we'll see some regulars and a bit of community

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** It tends to read more like the classifieds section of the newspaper

&gt;&gt;**bep:** There isn't much of a community to speak of unless you count our fantastic moderation team

&gt;3) What kind of interest have you seen since you ran that nifty sidebar ad?

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** Oh man

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** [The traffic](/r/needamod/about/traffic) has increased about eleventy-billion percent

&gt;4) Any bizarre requests which you care to recall for us? Any requests or offers which made you laugh?

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** Nothing that stands out

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** Not yet

&gt;5) What kind of response have you seen from the ""looking for mods"" group? Has anyone written back to thank you for this service?

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** We've had at least one message from a very satisfied mod

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** There hasn't been much feedback other than a very positive response to the advertisement and our push to revitalize /r/needamod. We have received some praise for adding the category buttons that sort the ""offers to mod"" from the ""now hiring"" threads.

&gt;6) Do you have any rules which you enforce on the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** really just the ever present ""don't be a dick"" rule. (and no spamming!)

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** There aren't any specific rules at the moment

&gt;7) I notice you have a sticky about mods who 'collect' subreddits. Can you describe this and tell us more about your position?

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** One of our goals in needamod is to help give fresh new mods a chance to moderate and hopefully pair them with subreddits they either already enjoy or discover new ones they will really want to help grow. If the same people that already moderate numerous subreddits are added every time then those new users won't get a chance. There are also a certain type of moderator that will apply for and accept moderatorship in any subreddit without regard for subject or mod style. Quite often those moderators are just adding to their list and aren't always very helpful. This isn't to say anyone that moderates a large number of subreddits is a bad choice! Experience counts for a lot. It's up to each team to check out potentials and make up their own mind. Tools like stattit.com (check for amount modded and how often they get added to new subreddits) and looking through their userpage for mod comments are both great ways to make your decision.

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** The sticky is there as a reminder to look closely at who you add as a moderator to your subreddit. Lately there have been some mods that try to get added to as many subreddits as possible like it's a competition. These people often risk being perceived as ""power mods"" who have a disproportionate amound of control and influence over a wide array of subreddits. It's true that some moderators do have the capacity to handle a huge work load

&gt;8)Any other projects you would like to mention?

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo:** Nothing of my own really. But if you're a new mod also check out /r/modhelp

&gt;&gt;**sodypop:** When I'm less busy I plan on writing a bot that will allow the OP of a needamod thread to toggle ""contest mode"" on or off. Other than that

The Nintendo 64 gaming system was released in North America in 1996

[/r/n64](http://i.imgur.com/REzQsoC.gif) is a fantastic jaunt back in time for me, and trying to remember all the [spawn points in Goldeneye.](http://i.imgur.com/8iOtnft.gif) My all time favourite n64 game has to be [Mario Golf.](http://i.imgur.com/T9IxCt9.gif) Don't hate. This game held my interest [for years.](http://i.imgur.com/k5FDycu.gif) Unlike the more sophisticated golf sims of modern systems, [Mario Golf was pure fun;](http://i.imgur.com/ZzcWiVK.gif) grabbing driver and hammering a shot one handed as King Koopa was especially satisfying. I enjoy reading the subreddit and then grabbing my now 17 year old system and [flicking that analog stick](http://i.imgur.com/bzqcZQJ.gif) (not a euphemism.)

So it was with great delight that I spoke with the mods of /r/n64:

&gt;1) The Nintendo 64 is a classic video game system

&gt;&gt;**thequirts:** I'd say that's definitely because the N64 is a timeless system. Sure the graphics weren't always pretty (the 3D transition didn't go so well for some games) but on the whole Nintendo put out a remarkable amount of great content

&gt;&gt;**brendanblack:** People still love the console, Mario Kart 64), and it gave life to new action-adventure games. The type of games are endless, so for everyone, there is a Nintendo 64 game for them.

&gt;&gt;**mandlar:**The N64 was an introduction of a new era of games: 3D and party games! I think it's still a big hit now because it's really not too old and picking up a console and some games for it is very affordable nowadays.

&gt;2) What are some of your favourite n64 games?

&gt;&gt;**thequirts:** The N64 has a ton of great games: Super Mario 64, Perfect Dark, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and Donkey Kong 64

&gt;&gt;**brendanblack:** There are of course the most sought after games, Super Smash Bros, Paper Mario, Donkey Kong 64, and Legend of Zelda, just as some easy favorites. But on my list, would also come the games I grew up loving, Pokemon Stadium

&gt;&gt;**mandlar:**My top ten: Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Starfox 64, Goldeneye, Star Wars Shadows of the Empire, Super Smash Bros, Mario Golf, Mario Party 2

&gt;3) what if your favourite post in this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**thequirts:** [My n64 collection](http://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/1i3x8e/my_n64_collection_suggestions/) Just an example of an awesome collection and great discussion on some of the n64's best games.

&gt;&gt;**brendanblack:** Probably [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/1bpczw/did_i_hit_the_jackpot_purchased_from_a_mate_at/) To me

&gt;&gt;**mandlar:**[The album of a 64DD.](http://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/1ii4ko/before_i_sell_it_an_album_of_my_64dd_xpost_from/) Such a rare collector's item! It's a shame the 64DD never went into full production.

&gt;4) What do you think about n64 emulators and roms?

&gt;&gt;**thequirts:** It's always better to have the original cart and play on a tv. That being said, its great for that too.

&gt;&gt;**brendanblack:** I personally think the are great tools. They allow you to play games you never got to, and that is incredible. But, That will never beat that big cartridge going in and powering up in front of you.

&gt;&gt;**kism3:** Notable Nintendo 64 Projects [64drive](http://64drive.retroactive.be/) and [Everdrive 64](http://krikzz.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=54) allowing the loading of homebrew roms and backups of games onto the Nintendo 64.

&gt;&gt;Also the upcomming [N64 VGA/HDMI mod](http://imgur.com/a/DdEuq) by [MarshallH](http://benheck.com/) which bypasses the video DAC in the N64 to allow for much better scaling.

&gt;&gt;**mandlar:** I think the real deal is better

&gt;5) If you could give advice to Nintendo regarding the N64 what would it be? (Current Nintendo or 1990's nintendo

&gt;&gt;**thequirts:** I'd say currently Nintendo should get more N64 games on virtual console! Only 21 games are available to current gen players

&gt;&gt;**brendanblack:** I would talk to current Nintendo, but I could never get too into it, having to flail my arms around so much. The WiiU is better, but I'd still love to see an old fashion sit and play.

&gt;&gt;**mandlar:** I'd like to see some N64 games rebooted in the current era. Not just emulated on the virtual console, with perhaps more content.

&gt;6) Any other projects you would like us to know about?

&gt;&gt;**thequirts:** The only major active N64 projects going on are the attempts to emulate the console's games, and its a fantastic system.

&gt;&gt;**brendanblack:** The subreddit is under new moderation from a great team

&gt;&gt;**mandlar:**Not a project, Edward McKay has a lot of N64 games for fair prices everytime I visit: http://www.edmckay.com/ And be sure you price check! http://videogames.pricecharting.com/

I thought I might get a better answer [out of the mods

&gt; How did you get involved with /r/identifythisfont? What is your background with typography?

&gt;&gt;**neilplatform1:** I got involved to try and keep font id requests out of some of the other typography subreddits. I've been working in and around publishing since the late eighties

&gt;&gt;**seanomenon:** I was invited to help moderate /r/typography in the summer of 2011, and I love lettering and designing type.

&gt; There are some really gorgeous fonts on this subreddit. What is your favourite font?

&gt;&gt;**neilplatform1:** My favourite is [Frutiger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger)

&gt;&gt;**seanomenon:** I'm always kind of stumped by this question, and work in different ways when combined. That said, I have a few favorites that I always turn to: Dolly, Futura, Sabon, Avenir, Univers.

&gt; Are there many reposts? What font do people most often need help identifying? What's your favourite submission?

&gt;&gt;**neilplatform1:** [Gotham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(typeface\)) and [Neutraface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutraface) are a couple of recent typefaces that are everywhere right now so they come up a lot. I think [Futura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)) is probably the most requested classic font. Maybe we should compile a Top 10.

&gt;&gt;**seanomenon:** We get runs of the same font, which isn't surprising; they can be difficult to identify, half the time they aren't fonts, and there are so many script fonts out there.

&gt; What are the submission rules of /r/identifythisfont? Do you have any commenting rules?

&gt;&gt;**neilplatform1:** The only real rule for me is provide a decent sample. We get quite a lot of requests for things that are not fonts, eg, where you saw a font and what you'd want to use it for.

&gt;&gt;**seanomenon:** our submission and identification rules are in the sidebar, and any info you have. 2. Set post flair to ""Open Question."" 3. When your font is identified, set the post to the appropriate flag. (See descriptions below.) 4. Stick around and try to help identify some of the other open questions.

&gt;&gt;When identifying: 1. Please be polite. 2. Add a link to the font when possible. 3. Please do not link to any pirated fonts.

&gt; Anything you would like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**seanomenon:** Our commenters are consistently helpful, which is no small feat on a web forum. Thanks for helping all the folks who are struggling to find a font!

Hello

Anyway, you are my little gentleman. I'll take you to foggy London town 'cause you are my little gentleman.""

My journey started in London because that's where Heathrow is. Shortly after, indeed, one of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. There are many sheep there, though. I wonder what's up with that. After touring around Wales, we hoped in the car and made our way to London.

London was everything I could have possible imagined. And we were lucky enough to see a sunny London instead of a rainy one. The amount of history in that city is incredible. 

I'm not going to go on about my adventures because 1. I don't want to bore you and 2. in the rare occasion one of you is my friend IRL and will link this post to my facebook thus exposing my secret reddit personality to the world.

I will say this

Without further ado, and /u/Skuld.

&gt;##1.  Where in the UK are you all from?

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** Coventry

&gt;&gt; **BritishEnglishPolice** Wiltshire

&gt;&gt; **Skuld** West Yorkshire

&gt;##2.  What's your favorite place to visit in the UK?

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** London. I like busy metropolises.

&gt;&gt; **BritishEnglishPolice** London. So amazing! So many things to do and there's so much culture from all over the world in one place.

&gt;&gt; **Skuld** London

&gt;##3.  What are some stereotypical British things you absolutely hate?

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** Chavs

&gt;&gt; **BritishEnglishPolice** Footie.Not too fascinated.

&gt;&gt; **Skuld** Cricket is pretty dull!

&gt;##4.  Are you really that fascinated with America? Or were my Welsh travel companions just too engrossed in American TV?

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** Not really. I hate American politics, got a photo next to a Sherrif's car too. Hated the heat and humidity of the place though. We also happened to arrive as a hurricane or something was making its way over. The rain was pretty heavy. Also, I enjoy watching House and The Big Bang Theory.

&gt;&gt; **BritishEnglishPolice** I have cousins in LA so have been a couple of times. Can't *stand* some of your cultural habits though ;)

&gt;&gt; **Skuld** I like New York city

&gt;##5.  What about the UK do you love the most?

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** British comedy. I think we have some of the best comedians in the world.

&gt;&gt; **BritishEnglishPolice** Our roads, how we help our fellow man and woman (NHS) and so forth.

&gt;##6.  [What would you say you do](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SoWNMNKNeM) as moderators for /r/UK?

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** If Jews were misrepresented posts or editorialised headlines

&gt;&gt; **BritishEnglishPolice** Delete spam

&gt;##7. What do you wish foreigners knew about your country?

&gt;&gt; **BritishEnglishPolice** That our food is actually quite good ;)

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** I wish foreigners knew about queueing etiquette and other culture differences. Countries where bartering is commonplace everywhere, wish that every foreigner could try every British food, as I'm confident they'll find something they love, even if they hate everything else.

1366267524.0,1clcaf,"April 18 ,2013, Firefall - an MMOFPS with tiki torches and heavy mining machinery.",kjoneslol,214,27

**2

Firefall is a team-based MMOFPS with some RPG elements and is the first and only video game from Red 5 Studios. It is currently in closed beta (you can buy immediate access [here](http://beta.firefallthegame.com/founders)) and is anticipated to be free-to-play. [The story is, a big purple wall, and they will try and kill you and ""your family"". Seriously, these guys are total jerks if you ever get close enough to hear them. So you're an [ARES pilot](http://i.imgur.com/PAnSskt.jpg), which are big battleframes, and you fly around kicking ass and mining for resources. Yeah, you can fly

There are 5 ""battleframes"" you can choose from which each progress into two more types. The five basic types are: assault (fly around shooting stuff), recon (sniper/sneaky), and the engineer (turrets and mobile stations like ammo, hp, and shields). There are more tiers planned but as of right now you can choose from those four and then two more per. You can read more about them [here](http://firefall-wiki.com/w/Category:Battleframes#List_of_Battleframes).

When you start playing Firefall you will find yourself ""thumping"". The game's economy and character progression revolves around mining for resources that were scattered across the land from the big space ship crash reaction mayhem thing. [Thumpers](http://i.imgur.com/YnhNvHD.jpg) are big mining drills that are launched from orbiting space ships down onto the Earth's surface. While the thumper is mining for resources (it takes anywhere between 5-20 minutes depending on the level of thumper you're using) is will make a lot of seismic waves and will attract the attention of the newly improved [wildlife of Brazil](http://i.imgur.com/7VkyAMx.jpg). This phase of the game will remind people of Starship Troopers. You fight off hoards of mutated bugs.

You get experience from thumping and you get resources. Resources are used for crafting which are used to improve your character. They've changed a lot over time but the current iteration has you using experience to unlock three prerequisites which passively improve your character are used in conjunction with crafting items while also use those three prerequisites (power, it's not like you have a spell book or anything like that. Item drops are the same way, you don't loot weapons or armor, you look ammo, health, and resources. If you want cool weapons then you'll find yourself crafting them.

Once you get tired of thumping or you're all maxed out then you can run around doing dynamic missions or [fight off the Chosen](http://production_firefall-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/10/Incursion-1024x640.jpg) who will actively try and capture outposts and bases. If no one tries to fight them off then your map is going to look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/bmYmgi5.jpg) as opposed to [this](http://i.imgur.com/q4SiNOe.jpg). There's also PvP so you can queue up and fight other players in a few select maps and game types. For gametypes there is team deathmatch

The game is still very much a beta so there is a lot of content missing. They've also redid a lot over the years and the game has changed *completely* several times so it's likely we've got a long ways to go. It's a fun game

I spoke to the moderators of /r/Firefall about what they like about the game and how they got into it.

&gt;##1. How did you get into Firefall?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Hoder_ Following Elementz (curse gaming League of legends) waaaay back in the day when he was still clg and he was posting about the game. I read about it on the forums

&gt;&gt;   /u/zVulture I saw a video for it and through it was 'Ihh

&gt;&gt;   /u/bctrainers A friend of mine back in 2010 on IRC suggested for me to try out Firefall.

&gt;##2. How long have you been playing (AKA how many XP wipes have you survived)?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Hoder_ Been playing every since the game went into beta phase

&gt;&gt;   /u/zVulture Well I think it was the 'third' wave of invites right after Open World was first started. So beyond the few who got in the PvP tests before

&gt;&gt;   /u/bctrainers I actually haven't played Firefall since late 2011.

&gt;##3. What is your favorite battleframe?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Hoder_ Favorite battleframe has to be assault

&gt;&gt;   /u/zVulture This is a hard one to pick

&gt;&gt;   /u/bctrainers Assault for me

&gt;##4. Do you prefer PvP or PvE?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Hoder_ Currently doing a lot of PvE as it's not as time constricting as PvP (you leave whenever you want). Otherwise you'd find me most of the time in PvP games.

&gt;&gt;   /u/zVulture Due to some competitive gaming when I was younger

&gt;&gt;   /u/bctrainers PvP. I just like PVP in general

&gt;##5. What is your favorite part of the game?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Hoder_ Has to be the company behind the game. These will do anything and everything for the game. We didn't like the huge vertical progression they had with levels? They threw them out. We don't like the tier system and the inbalancements due to crafting? Next patch the tier system is gone and pvp gear is flat on stats.

&gt;&gt;   /u/zVulture The main thing I love is Gliding in the amazing world that has been created. Just having the landscape zip past beneath you passing by tree's and enemies alike. The detail gone into creating each area of the game makes it enjoyable just to explore.

&gt;&gt;   /u/bctrainers In agreement with hoder here. R5 Studios is probably one of the few companies that actually has fun while making their game. You can see that in the game world as well! The game feels as if it actually has a soul!

&gt;##6. If you could change or add anything about the game

&gt;&gt;   /u/Hoder_ Change or add anything to the game? I'd say the game is doing pretty great, ... But that's up to the devs, those guys have lives as well. So if I had to add anything to the game? Another pvp mode with objective based pvp (bomb plant, ...), as those are much easier to follow as spectator.

&gt;&gt;   /u/zVulture A re-work of the engineer frames. Before the first XP wipe

&gt;&gt;   /u/bctrainers Seeing it get out of beta

&gt;##7. Do you have anything you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Hoder_ A shout out to red5 studios for taking the time to create this awesome free game and get so much involved with the community. You can talk to them daily on irc

&gt;&gt;   /u/zVulture My and User interaction Red5 has been one of the best experiences. The community has had many suggestions fulfilled by the dev team (big example being darker nights). As well as been willing to delay product release

&gt;&gt;   /u/bctrainers Nothing too much to add. r5 normally sticks around on the #Firefall IRC. They post here on the firefall subreddit from time to time as well. We're all nerds in the grand scheme of things!

Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and a gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.  It is the goal of astrophotographers everywhere to get a glimpse of that barrel-throwing gorilla.  It's even more sought out after than acquiring a picture of the Loch Ness Monster or a Yeti (besides

Once these pictures have been taken

Or something like that.  Isn't that why we spend so much time looking at pictures of space?  Why else would we spend billions on something like the Hubble Telescope?

So - no on the gorilla thing then?  Well


I was able to interview two mods

----

&gt;## What type of equipment is necessary for astrophotography?

&gt;&gt;**andrewinmelbourne:** You need a camera and a telescope.

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** A camera...that's about it. The moon
From there, then a telescope to see even more.

&gt;##How can someone who is interested get started?

&gt;&gt;**andrewinmelbourne:** To get started visit some local astrophotography club and check out their rigs.

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** Find a good used DSLR on Craigslist
&gt; What type of posts can subscribers expect to see or are encouraged to post?

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** Anything from our members' latest efforts (Which might be ""My first attempt at _____!"") up to magazine and textbook class works that represent dozens of hours of image acquisition and post processing by some incredibly talented hobbyists. There's also HowTos and DIYs

&gt;##Please tell us about you (the mods) and how you got involved in astrophotography.


&gt;&gt;**andrewinmelbourne:** So I enjoyed looking at pics that Editors had taken of planets and stars. I went to /r/astrophotography three years ago and it didn't exist. So I started it.

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** Love stars. Love cameras. It was kinda an obvious thing. :)


&gt;##Do you have any favorite photos or posts that have been posted?

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** My favorites are still almost always the first-time attempts...especially the ones with the most basic of equipment. I love it when someone just looks up at the sky

&gt;##What are the most common objects that are photographed?

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** There's 3. M42

&gt; What would you like to see in the future of your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** Clear skies.

&gt;## How can someone participate in astrophotography if they live in the middle of a big city?

&gt;&gt;**EorEquis:** One of our most prolific and popular imagers lives just outside Detroit, use of a quality light pollution filter, and some hard-won post-processing skill. It ain't easy, but it's quite doable!

&gt;&gt;The user in question is /u/tashabasha . Here [is one of his recent threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/19r9y4/whirlpool_galaxy/) where

&gt;## /u/tashabasha expands on his experience in astrophotography while being in Detroit.

&gt;&gt;I really love the hobby. That thread he pointed you to is a good picture

&gt;&gt;Astrophotography in a light-polluted area seems impossible, CA. I was up late and saw the Milky Way cross the sky for the first time in my life and it was really a life-changing event for me. That got me started in astrophotography. I had always enjoyed photography, but taking pictures like these is totally different than regular photography because ISO is different, exposure times are different, stability is important, removing noise, dust motes, etc.

&gt;&gt;For light-polluted areas, I posted an image of a single, 2 minute exposure to show the light pollution. You can barely see the final result through the haze.

&gt;&gt;Things important in astrophotography in light polluted areas -

&gt;&gt;* you need some type of light-pollution filter attached. This filters out the mercury and sodium street lights that surround me

&gt;&gt;* Exposure time is what's important in astrophotography (it's all about capturing the photons)


&gt;&gt;* your exposure time can only be so long before the histogram is ""washed out"" by light pollution, you see exposures that are 10-15 minutes long.

&gt;&gt;* processing is very important, but there's also StarTools, which are like photoshop but made by astrophotographers for astrophotographers.

&gt;&gt;* Since I can't really see the stars like others, which shows the night sky as it looks where you are, I would find a star, look at the program, move the scope, find a star, look at the program, only to realize I was ""this close"" to it and I didn't get it.

&gt;&gt;* I've learned that a ""go-to"" mount is important - it has a computer that knows the night sky all the time,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,t3_1ac64s

/r/wtfdidijustread is pretty self-explanatory and I didn’t really have enough time to write an intro for the subreddit. So

I really like to poop

I have been pooping on Sunday my whole life. I used to only poop once a week

The Fire Nation attacked.

It was then I realized being lazy and eating taco bell three days in a row before a week of feces was about to exit my bowels

I manned the battle stations well - as load after load of fiery shit exploded from my rectum. I had to hold my ground
The light gunners took a rest. A silence befell the room. The anticipation was building.

Was it over? No.

I knew it was only a matter of time before the atom bomb of shit was about to be dropped onto the Hiroshima of toilet bowls. It was now a waiting game.

Several minutes passed by. I could feel my intestines churning as big boy navigated to the poop chute.

It was time. The prairie dog scouting around. This is it

Snorlax himself started to exit from inside my butthole
I awoke. I had passed out from the shear amount of pain. It was finally over.

In a sigh of relief I stared down on my accomplishment. And I wiped. 100% was blood. It took several wipes to remove all the blood and excrement.

I no longer wait a week to poop and I no longer poop on Sundays..

TL;DR: Sunday

I pulled down my pants and prepared my bowels for this interview...

&gt;##1. What sparked you to create the subreddit? 

&gt;&gt;**whenamanlovesa_ama** The subreddit came from a story about horse rape. /u/shelldog put down /r/whatthefuckdidijustread and obtained the top comment. As a joke I went to create it and under a reddit rule you can't have an obscene word in a subreddit name. So I created /r/wtfdidijustread and after posting the story I linked to it in a /r/nocontext style.

&gt;&gt;**Nesman64** http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/10yjx9/the_lovely_moment_where_you_shatter_your_iphone/c6hsdbg

&gt;&gt;I dug up the comment that started us off. There are a few deleted comments in there. Spelling out the ""wtf"" was suggested

&gt;##2. What is your favorite submission made to the sub?

&gt;&gt;**whenamanlovesa_ama** We honestly get a lot of funny submissions, and finally one I found about a homeless man having sex with a dead homeless man on a bench during recess.

&gt;##3. How many times have you seen the reply “wut”?

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** Quite a few times. A lot of the posts just leave you bewildered. I've seen ""What the fuck did I just read..."" more though

&gt;##4. Do you think you may have to compete with /r/nocontext?

&gt;&gt;**shelldog** I don't think there is a competition, therefore leading to more submissions.

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** Good question. In my opinion, while in nocontext the posts will make you curious as to what the context of the comment was and might not actually be that WTF once you read the context. All in all, we are some what related, but not really. We have a link to /r/nocontext on our subreddit because it's an awesome subreddit. I've messaged the mods two times asking to be on their sidebar but no reply, hopefully they will return the favor.

&gt;##5. Have you ever written a comment that was /r/wtfdidijustread material?

&gt;&gt;**shelldog** for my own wtf comment, so I did the math and figured a mallard duck has a slightly bigger penis, proportionally, than an arabian horse. I'm sure I've had a few other wtf comments, but that's one of my recent ones.

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** Yes

&gt;##6. Is there anything else you’d like to add?

&gt;&gt;**MR_WITTY_RESPONSE** Nope.

I've also realized that MR_WITTY_RESPONSE has deleted his account. I was subscribed to most of the subreddits he moderated. I will miss him, not very witty. ",,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,WRITER,

Misc is short for miscellaneous

Before I start talking about r/Misc I need to talk about r/reddit &amp; reddit.com itself. Consider this my delayed eulogy to r/reddit. In the beginning there was reddit. [A brimming glistening hot spot for Super Saiyan 4 uber nerds and people who wanted a new type of news feed.](http://web.archive.org/web/20050924153730/http://reddit.com/) Then comments were added and ~~it went to shit in hand basket~~ exploded with new users. So much so that reddit decided it needed to start ""categorized"" the massive flow of [infinite content.](https://www.google.com/search?gcx=w&amp;ix=c2&amp;q=cat+pics&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1333&amp;bih=689&amp;sei=VOHNTv7dBKG90AHAir0E) In the place called [**The INTERNET**](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Internet_map_1024.jpg) this normally meant giving posts tags for which the user could search for a keyword and find relative posts that way. [The reddit admins](http://i.imgur.com/vhee7.jpg ""Ladies

If you couldn't figure out sub-reddits , for those people who worry / monitor / annoy / hunt  [karma whores](http://www.reddit.com/r/TellMeSomethingGood/comments/mlrr5/maxwellhill_just_became_the_1st_redditor_to_hit/), I'll let you in on a little secret. Its all just imaginary numbers on a website. It means nothing. [Nothing at all.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsVsHu2EEfo ""I double dog dare you to watch all 10 minutes."") With the closing of r/reddit. Came the birth of r/misc. What was once a ghost town sub-reddit (for 3 years!) has been brought back to life. So please join me, in posting the most random stuff there. We all know you're going to do it sooner or later.

The interview with [mexicanStaringFrog](/user/mexicanStaringFrog) is up! Read below.

&gt; ### Where do you see r/Misc going in the future?
&gt;&gt; We see it as a gateway for the rest of reddit. It's not meant to replace any of the existing ones

&gt; ### In your own words
&gt;&gt;There has been a lot of complaining from redditors that the quality of the content of other subreddits had degraded since /r/reddit was closed. /r/misc seems like a good choice. Also

&gt; ### Just 4 mods? Are you up for the task? Even the A-Team had 5 guys.
&gt;&gt; A-team used to have some time off. We are on reddit all day. Also

&gt; ### When r/misc becomes too big to fail like /r/IAMA what will you say is your excuse to try to close r/Misc down in a [hissyfit?](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hissy%20fit&amp;defid=122247) (This is a joke question)
&gt;&gt; /r/SubredditDrama needs new content.

&gt; ###Tell me sir
&gt;&gt; Huh?

Games are a great way to escape all the stress and appointments. Just sit on the couch, who are we to judge you? 

That's why it is not weird to believe that a lot of people are making their own game, but just like rules, everything has an exception. But in this post we focus on the larger group of game makers. Those who love gaming, and love it even more to share it with other people. The only problem is that not everyone's voice will be heared. 

This is the point where /r/playmygame comes in the lovely picture. This subreddit gives game developers the opportunity to share their game with the rest of the world (mostly redditors). And if you don't make games

Now lets jump to the interview with the mods.

&gt;#1. What is the story behind the creation of this subreddit and/or how did you get involved with /r/playmygame?

&gt;&gt; **Draspur** I made /r/playmygame about 8 months ago with the general idea in mind. I wasn't quite sure what to do with it and just forgot about it. I was browsing /r/gamedev a few weeks ago and noticed /u/gojirra thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fint0/what_are_your_favorite_game_and_game_dev_related/) which reminded me of it, and the members and mods quickly shaped the subreddit into an awesome community.

&gt;&gt; **Skafos_** I got involved with playmygame through a needamod thing. In fact

&gt;&gt; **Zooeyzooey42** Like skafos

&gt;#2. What kind of games are getting posted a lot?

&gt;&gt; **Draspur** All kinds of games really, completed projects. iPhone and android apps are a popular trend, so we added filters to accommodate. But really all kind of games, first person shooters, rpgs, multiplayer, platformers; all kinds of cool stuff.

&gt;&gt; **Zooeyzooey42** Ive seen quite a few mobile games

&gt;#3. Do you create games too and/or do you play the games that are posted?
&gt;&gt; **Draspur** Absolutely, the iphone game is taking most of my game-related time.

&gt;&gt; **Skafos_** I'm primarily a play tester there and whenever I feel bored

&gt;&gt; **Zooeyzooey42** I play some of the games on the subreddit

&gt;#4. Which game from this subreddit blew your mind the most?

&gt;&gt; **Draspur** [Blinscape](http://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1fy5si/completed_blindscape_a_game_told_entirely_through/) and [Life Goes On](http://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1fw3ni/demoin_life_goes_on_you_use_your_dead_bodies_to/) really impressed me. 
I had actually heard about blindscape before and downloaded it but it would crash on my crappy ipod touch. Once I saw it posted to my subreddit
Life Goes On uses a cool concept of utilizing your past bodies to progress through the game. The puzzles and overall aesthetics felt very professional and the game is thoroughly fun and challenging. My favorite part is that each new life gets an entirely new name

&gt;&gt; **Zooeyzooey42** I thought steam marines was pretty good

&gt;#5. Is this subreddit only to promote your game or also to test it?
&gt;&gt; **Draspur** Both absolutely! We have tags like [completed] and [beta] to distinguish. Check out the sidebar for further information.

&gt;&gt; **Skafos_** We're mostly functioning to give gamedevs a platform to get feedback but gamedevs also find it easier for their game to get known through our subreddit.

&gt;&gt; **Zooeyzooey42** Either one is fine.

&gt;#6. Do you have any tips for beginning game developers?

&gt;&gt; **Draspur** The internet is your friend. /r/gamedev has a great list of resources and is generally a great place to communicate and whatnot. There are thousands of free resources online that are relevant to nearly every aspect you're interested regarding game development. I knew absolutely nothing about the subject but managed to teach myself and now have a working iPhone game (albeit buggy and incomplete at the moment). Oh

&gt;&gt; **Skafos_** Test

&gt;#7. Would you like to say/promote/share anything else?

&gt;&gt; **Draspur** Don't be scared off if your unfamiliar with game development! This subreddit is for players just as much as developers. It's a great place to find innovative and creative games

&gt;&gt; **Skafos_** Bacon.

&gt;&gt; **Zooeyzooey42** I would like to thank my sponsors

Enjoy your tuesday! And sorry for the lack of links,False,self,t5_2sgno,1372156088.0,,WRITER,t3_1h11u7

**3.450** sleeping in fighters for **8 months!** 

Imagine yourself in your pyjamas, before the day you have an important appointment early in the morning. Before you are ready to enter the [magical dream world](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/) you quickly set your alarm before you forget it. You fall asleep, your head being cuddled by the soft pillow, not realising what tomorrow will actually bring you.     
The next morning your alarm goes off. It's one of your favorite songs which you decided to use as an alarm
You turn your head
*""I can rest for another 5 minutes""* you think
Your eyes close slowly.       
You open them again but there is something wrong.      
You feel awake. *too awake*. You look quickly at your clock and realise that in the what seemed like 5 seconds time

Now imagine the fact that there exists a subreddit

Well, weekend, job, no job. So i am more than happy to feature this subreddit, for you.

/r/GetOutOfBed gives you the best tips and tricks to get out of bed or to improve your sleep. For every person whose brain [decideded](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/yytsm/august_28_2012_rmyevilplan_my_evil_plan_is_to/) to get him/her almost every morning

So, who will give you an idea of how /r/GetOutOfBed looks like.


&gt;##1.How did you come up with the idea to make /r/GetOutOfBed? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** At the start of this year, i have fallen off the bandwagon myself, but i'm glad to know that it's still a resource that helps others. 

&gt;##2.What sort of posts does one find here? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** Anything about sleep or sleep hacking is welcome

&gt;##3.What is the best tip/trick you have seen posted? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** a popular trick is to practice getting up in the morning by using this: http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/ 

&gt;##4.Can    you    tell    me    in     a    few    sentences    why    i    should    /r/GetOutOfBed?     A    reason    to    improve    my    sleep?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Well,    is    a    sign    that    something    is    wrong.    Besides    just    the    quality    of    life    issue,    there’s    also    a    personal    motivation    issue    involved    with    sleeping    in.    I    want    to    wake    up    motivated    and    energized,    not    lazy    or    depressed.    And    I    think     that    you    can’t    really     isolate    the    selfcontrol    aspect    from    the    sleep    quality    or    health    quality    aspect.    I    find    that    if    I    get    bad     sleep,    forcing     myself    to    get    up    at    a    regular    hour    isn't    sustainable.    Ultimately    it    comes    down    to    what    you    want    from    your    life.    Do    you    want     to    feel    refreshed    and    energized    and    motivated     instead     of    lazy    and    complacent    when    you    first    wakeup?    Do     you    want    to    optimize    your    sleep    and    feel    great?    If    so,    then     I    think    those    ideals    naturally    lead    to    /r/GetOutOfBed.


&gt;##5.I   wake    in    the    middle    of     the     night     out     of     nowhere     multiple     times.     How     can    i    prevent     this    from    happening    again?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Sleep    is    pretty    complicated

&gt;&gt;    1.Change     up     your     diet    if     you      have     any     digestion     issues.     I     eat     mostly     Paleo     and     that     helped     my      overall     health     and     sleep     quality.    Eeriment     with     cutting     out     certain     kinds     of     food     and      see      how     you     feel     afterwards.     Test     various     things     and     reflect     on     the     outcomes.            

&gt;&gt;    2.Limit     artificial      light     exposure.     This     is     probably      one     of      the     huge     things     that     has     changed     sleeping      habits     in     post-industrial     cultures.     Circadian     rhythms     are     ingrained      in     biological      structures     and     humans     are     no    exception.     Light     is     one      of     the     big      things     that    will     influence     your     clock,     which     reduces    the      amount     of     blue     light     that     would     be     in     a     completely     white     screen.     I      also     will     wear    red-tintend     glasses     or     goggles     to     help     mitigate     the     effects     of     regular     indoor     lighting.     In     the     future    I     want     to    get    prescription     sunglasses     or     something     so    I    can     do     things     at     night     and     still     see,     but     also     reduce     the     effects     of     bright     or     white     light.     I     also     want    to    see     what     happens     if     the    sunglasses     are     darker     and     if     having      dim     light     is     more     important     than     just     having     red/yellow-tinted     light.           

&gt;&gt;    3.Take     lots     of     Vitamin     D     in     the     morning—like 5

&gt;&gt;    4.Calm     down.     This     is     something     that     I     recently      figured     out.     Although     diet      and     light     exposure     do    have     effects,     you     will     get     really    crappy    sleep    if     you     sleep     at    all.     At     least,     that's     what     I     discovered       for     
myself.     Here's       what     helps     me     a     lot:       

&gt;&gt;    * Have     a     regular     evening     routine

&gt;&gt;    * Experiment      with     binaural     beats.     I     use     the     iPhone's     SleepStream     app     and     choose    the     ""Deep     sleep"" wavelength,     it's      a     placebo      that    works      for     me.     And     if     it     works,      I      don't     really     care     how     it     works.     

&gt;&gt;    * Sit     without     a     chair     and     count.     I      like     the     [seiza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza)     position,     but       I'm      getting      better.          
I    count     to     100     and     start     over,      anxious,     bored     or     frustrated,     it     means     you    really     need     to     do     it     and     you     should     keep     going.     The     more     you     feel     like     avoiding     calming    down,     the     more     you     need     to     calm     down.     At     least,     that     is     what     I     have     found     for     myself.         
   
&gt;&gt;    Anyway


&gt;##6.Do you want to say anything to your subscribers? Maybe a little advertising? I wont tell anybody. 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint**     Sure

Welcome to fourth and final week of celebration at Subreddit of the Day.  We, (and sex)!  Usually you'll see us hangin' with the up-an-comers, but for the next seven days, it's BIGS week!  Semana grande!  This is our one and only shot at interviewing the moderators of reddit's largest subreddits so sit back and enjoy as we get some face time with reddit royalty! (And we get to read about sex!)

A quick note, hug your kids!  Talk to your spouse!  Turn that frown upside down!  C'mon, *let's bring the awesome!*

****

As promised

- /r/sex is a very big reddit that has a small subreddit approach.  Despite their huge numbers, friendly and welcoming place.

- /r/sex is one of the best communities out there.  Completely going against the idea that *as a subreddit grows

- the community is genuinely helpful!  They really care about each other so the good stuff gets upvoted

- the moderators are completely committed to the growth and success of /r/sex.  Huge team?  Nope, do what this mod team does... get in the comment section and lead by example!*

I'm really proud to feature /r/sex as our Monday Subreddit of the Day.  They are an incredible community and they make reddit.com a much better place!   Here to discuss /r/sex are [Maxxters](http://www.reddit.com/user/Maxxters) and [VaginalKnives](http://www.reddit.com/user/VaginalKnives)

&gt; Can you tell us a bit about yourself? Please give us a bit of real life background and tell us what you do here on reddit!

&gt;&gt;Maxxters:  I'm a former high school science and sex ed teacher and am currently a Master's student with my focus being Human Sexuality and Body Image. I also work as a fitness instructor and personal trainer. On reddit I try to get to as many of the /r/sex posts as I can and give my own opinions/answers to things. I also skive off to the other subreddits and lurk around there or post my own stories and answers (especially if it's on the topic of sexuality).

&gt;&gt;VaginalKnives:  I had a severe sexual pain condition that I only got the courage to see a doctor for years after my husband and I discovered it on our wedding night. Now I've had it diagnosed and treated

&gt;&gt;I mainly give advice to /r/sex readers who experience sexual pain

&gt;Let's talk qualifications - what makes you a great /r/sex mod?

&gt;&gt;VaginalKnives:   I think people mainly just love my username! But I have my personal experience of sexual pain (which is described by my username) and have done a bit of reading of studies and other resources on the topic.

&gt;&gt;Maxxters:  I guess some of my answers to #1 apply here. But in terms of being a mod specifically- I fucking CARE about this community like nothing else. I want everyone to have the freedom to be educated in sexual health and have the tools needed to have a fantastic

&gt;If you were to give us a one sentence mission statement about /r/sex

&gt;&gt;Maxx:  Wow that's hard. Guess it would be- A sex-positive place to learn about and discuss all things sexual.

&gt;&gt;VK:  Helping everyone live their best sex life.

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;Maxx:  I love being a mod, but when I get hate, I get **HATE**. But all in all this community is incredibly supportive with me being a mod and were initially the ones to vote me into modship. So I do my best to show that they made the right choice every day. Yes, I'm on /r/sex every single day, even when on vacation. I check the spam filters and reported links as often as I can. I ban people who aren't following the rules/are trolls. I get tonnes of PM's from people asking for personal help or wanting to discuss something about the /r/sex community as a whole. I try to click on pretty much every link and answer as many as I can. I check in with the other mods for updates or clarification of rules, etc. And I just have fun getting to know the community members and learning more and more from everyone every day.

&gt;&gt;VK:  The other moderators are a great support. Every day I check the spam filters, /r/sex is not for porn - there are other reddits for that. I'm officially in charge of making sure posts are marked NSFW correctly, but the other mods are very active and our readers are usually very good at marking things themselves, so I don't have to tag things often. The main moderator action I end up doing is warning people who insult our readers, and I ban those who continue the bad behaviour after a warning.

&gt;The most important question: what would you like to say to your community? What message do you have to those posting and those in the comment sections?

&gt;&gt;VK:  If sex hurts, female or other) having pain during sex (outside of consensual pain play in BDSM), you're doing it wrong or there is a medical/physical problem.

&gt;&gt;Maxx:  I would like to give a big huge thank you to the people that come here to post links/posts and contribute to comments in a positive, accepting, and helpful communities in reddit. I've always said that I would give absolutely anything for the rest of the world to share the views that the vast majority of our members have on sex and sexuality. It would make the world such a better place.

Thank you Maxxters and VaginalKnives for making our world a better place!

**Note: To fully appreciate this feature

Covered in advertisements. Chasing around competitors. Going at high speeds while maintaining control of your transportation. No - not NASCAR. It's professional bicycle racing. With races in some of the most spectacular scenery in the world

These are people I really respect. It takes an amazing amount of skill to go on these often long races in difficult terrain while traveling at a fast speed that is powered by your own ability on a bike. It almost makes me want to get into racing myself


---

Thanks to the mods of /r/Peloton for answering my questions:  /u/tdm911


&gt;##What is /r/Peloton and how did it come to be?

&gt;&gt;/r/Peloton is a community for professional road cycling - what we know as the WorldTour. Tour de France

&gt;&gt;As a keen cycling fan, so I created /r/Peloton. It was a lonely first month or so, but then a few people started posting and my fellow mods /u/Schele_Sjakie and /u/lurkingx joined and we really started gaining steam as the 2012 season progressed.

&gt;&gt;Peloton is a French word for the main group of riders in a road bike race. Have you seen [photos of a group of riders cycling past a field of sunflowers](http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/tdf_07_24/t19_19685039.jpg)? That's the peloton.

&gt;##What are types of posts can be expected in your group?

&gt;&gt;Anything related to professional road cycling. You'll find links to interviews with riders

&gt;##How does your sub transform when there's a big race taking place?

&gt;&gt;We have a lot going on during the biggest races throughout the year. We have multiple fantasy competitions where you select a team from the riders participating in the race and they are scored on how well they do throughout the race. We have discussions on stages, you can be sure you'll hear about it here!

&gt;##What would you suggest for someone who is new to professional cycling (as a spectator

&gt;&gt;Cycling can be quite a hard sport to keep up with to begin. There are so many different teams and riders participating in different races throughout the year and it can be overwhelming to someone new to the sport. I'd start off by watching the Tour de France (which has just started!!) as it's the most popular and well documented race throughout the year. Sites like cyclingnews.com and inrng.com provide plenty of articles you can read on riders, reviews and results. If you find a few riders or a team that you like during a race like the Tour de France, following them throughout the remainder of the season while you learn more would be a good way to start. 

&gt;&gt;Another great way to learn more would be by joining in the discussions constantly going on at /r/Peloton and asking questions. We have plenty of extremely passionate cycling fans who would love to answer any questions you may have about anything related to the sport.

&gt;##How can subscribers show their fan support in your community?

&gt;&gt;Cycling isn't quite like many other sports, we have user flair for both countries and team jerseys.

&gt;&gt;Because there isn't as much team fandom, we are all fans of the sport first and then the riders and teams second.

[The League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League)… what is there to say about The League that I can’t just say through a large assortment of GIFs.

Nevermind, and sorry for stealing ALL of those from the [GIF request thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/theleaguefx/comments/1487we/gif_request_thread_request_any_gif_to_be_made/). 

Actually... I don't give a fuck. [Do what you will.](http://i.imgur.com/LNamg.jpg)

Now to focus on some actual work - a strange concept

Here is a quote from the wiki to provide a thorough premise:

&gt; The League is an American sitcom that premiered on FX on October 29, Illinois, is a semi-improvised comedy about a fantasy football league, its members, and their everyday lives.

It is a wonderful show

You can watch it now on Netflix, Video Sharing Sites, Amazon, etc., for your viewing pleasure. God, I love subtle advertisements. Well, I’d much prefer to be paid. Whatever

Now that that is out of the way

&gt;##1. What would you like to say to those that have never seen The League before?

&gt;&gt;**BenHuge** You definitely don't need to know anything about fantasy football or even the sport to understand and love the show. I didn't even play fantasy football until after I started watching.

&gt;##2. Who is your favorite character on the show?

&gt;&gt;**BenHuge** Hands down

&gt;##3. Favorite quote or episode?

&gt;&gt;**BenHuge** ""Like, I'll go to the bathroom, I'll crap the booze out, have a mint, good to go.""

&gt;##4. Do you play fantasy football?

&gt;&gt;**BenHuge** Yessir.

&gt;##5. Do you watch football in real life? What team do you follow?

&gt;&gt;**BenHuge** Yes

&gt;##6. Is there anything else you would like to add

&gt;&gt;**BenHuge** Thanks to all the subscribers that make this an awesome place to hang your Shiva and make sure you check out theleaguefx GIF request thread if you are new. There's some awesome stuff in there to make the funny!

I want to think everyone has a vinyl record story

heart apart.  I'll share two &amp; hope you might do unto us in the comment section.  First off

tenth birthday and I had a party that could only be described as ""off the hizzy"".  I was a 

remarkably shy lad without any friends or interests at all.  You know those kids who burn the 

candle so bright you immediately want to conceive a child with anyone within arms reach?  Kids 

tHat shame even them most accomplished adult?  Well I was the complete opposite.  No one 

was more akin to a three toed tree sloth than me.  Rocks envied me for my dedication to 

laziness.

When November 9th came

most likely made me uncomfortable by singing happy birthday to me.  And I probably cried on my brown 

polyester pants. And then

absolutely changed my life... Supertramp's Breakfast in America on 12 inch vinyl.  Jesus

Joseph and Roger Hodgson - what an album!  Layers of sound

with each other

written!  I listened to this record constantly and from that day on I had something in my life 

to live for, I have to stop what I'm doing and 

smile and screw up my face the way you do when music hits the very marrow of your bones.

The other way vinyl impacted (saved) me was of course as an early teenager...  I can clearly 

remember the day when I discovered ""evil music""!  One of my friends had a newspaper route and he 

spent his loot on records which he played in his room on speakers that came up to my chin.  

Every two weeks, and of course, Ozzy Ozbourne records. I can 

remember hearing the distorted guitars

on the radio.  These guys weren't singing

doing something wrong and getting away with it.  My God did it feel good.  I don't listen to 

enough metal nowadays

*****

This brings us to /r/vinyl

why we chose these chuckleheads:

- great posts
- solid history of delivering the awesome?  Check.
- hard working moderators who demand quality posts
- a great community where people get together to respectfully discuss stuff they're into
- 25 cent wings and 6 dollar pitchers every Wednesday?  Check please!

Here to discuss one of my favourite subreddits is /u/theonegreatx

dweller

&gt;Please describe what we'll find at /r/vinyl. 

&gt;&gt;At r/vinyl, discussions about collecting, and advice posts for recommendations of records, stores, equipment, etc. All of these lead to a lot of good and interesting discussions about a variety of topics all related to records. I think the topic of vinyl is a broad and uniting subject, so it's cool that all sides of it are represented.

&gt;Like many great subreddits

&gt;&gt;This policy has definitely helped increase the amount of discussion. There's not much you can talk about when someone posts a record you've never seen and adds no information, and having this rule has somewhat ameliorated that problem as well.

&gt;I saw the ""Weekend Discussion"" thread - what else do you add as moderators? What can we look forward to?

&gt;&gt;The majority of what we do is stay on top of posts without descriptions, we just started a gift exchange with redditgifts after I suggested it a few months ago! So, if people want to trade some vinyl, I suggest they go sign up.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;Hah, I think because it's getting a little over-used and losing its impact. Personally, I would do almost anything for a clear vinyl copy of NOFX's The Decline, of which there are only 155. We did a weekly discussion post a few weeks back on the topic, if anyone wants to read other people's dream records.

&gt;Please take this paragraph and run with it. Anything you'd like to say

&gt;&gt;I spend more time in the /r/vinyl community than I do in any other part of reddit, I hope everyone will come check out /r/vinyl, we'd love to have you!

*A community for 1 year with 5

Admit it, you know you laugh. From the 9/11 jokes to the more recent Concordia jokes, you laughed through them all. I made the mistake of sharing [this little gem]( http://i.imgur.com/d2Rwl.jpg) on facebook. I learned a life long lesson that day. Sensitive bitches be crazy.

Back to the topic on hand, who I imagine to be the majority of readers, who decided to stay, drunk_otter, puredemo, and zagman76 have a few things to say.

&gt; Who's idea was it to start /r/toosoon and why?

&gt;&gt; drunk_otter: I think toosoon is the Michael Jackson subreddit. But as to /r/toosoon

&gt;&gt; puredemo: I created it after seeing people constantly making ""too soon"" style jokes in comment threads. I thought those could use their own home

&gt;&gt; zagman76: (d_o

&gt; What do you like most about being a mod?

&gt;&gt; drunk_otter: The users - I really like that people have a strong idea about what toosoon should be. There's often threads that debate toosoon content and what is and isn't and people really give a shit about it. I love that people care so much about the sub's unique brand of humour.

&gt;&gt; puredemo: The pussy.

&gt;&gt; zagman76: Collecting the dues from the newer mods and subscribers.

&gt;Has any post ever been too too soon?

&gt;&gt; drunk_otter: Yeah - sometimes. We were talking about Stephen Hawking being dead last week and I did a bit on that - that got downvoted to hell by the by the knights of no life in /r/all and it was three days before our users saw it. A lot of our stuff gets downvoted when it gets subbed because it going in the /all queue and people don't get that the toosoon joke is meant to be toosoon.

&gt;&gt; puredemo: I changed the background to a RIP banner of Christopher Hitchens dying


&gt;&gt; zagman76: I don't think so - I know a few times


&gt;Do you ever get compared to 4chan because of the ""insensitive"" posts?

&gt;&gt; drunk_otter: 
Some of the stuff that goes to the top comes from 4Chan - usually one of our users finds it and posts it because that's what we're there for. I like the concept of 4chan being the naught 14 year old kids of the internet and being willing to poke fun at the things that other people are so serious about. If I wasn't an old bastard I'd probably be a /b/astard but there's so much ""get off my lawn"" stuff there I couldn't take it.

&gt;&gt; puredemo: What's a 4chan?

&gt;&gt; zagman76: It might happen

&gt;Any last words you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; drunk_otter: I dunno - I guess it's probably just the memory for me of the evening of 9/11. Everyone was sitting around shocked and I spent the evening writing jokes about it because I knew that people would expect me to have them the next day. Whilst none of them were great

&gt;&gt; puredemo: So is /r/subredditoftheday like /r/shitredditsays then?

Everyone knows certain facts in gaming such as,294,967,296 variations? No? Well did you also know that the character [Travis Touchdown from No More Heroes is based on the likeness of Johnny Knoxville](http://imguol.com/2012/04/19/travis-touchdown-de-no-more-heroes-e-johnny-knoxville-conhecido-pela-serie-jackass-tem-em-comum-o-fato-de-viverem-no-limite-1334843597224_956x500.jpg) from the TV show Jackass? What? You didn't know that either? Well you should be subscribing to /r/DidYouKnowGaming and get some interesting factoids in your brain bank!

/r/DidYouKnowGaming is a bastion of knowledge and their segments invoke a symphony of interested ""Hmmm!"" sounds. Readers who are interested in the trivia and hidden workings of a game would benefit greatly with a troll through /r/DidYouKnowGaming. Much of the content posted isn't just skin deep minor details that are widely known

[There it goes!](http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/taiwo.gif)

Okay

It's these posts that make /r/DidYouKnowGaming great

Alright, so enjoy!

&gt;##1. How did /r/DidYouKnowGaming come to be?

&gt;&gt; **DidYouKnowGaming** A few weeks after I launched the DidYouKnowGaming website

&gt;##2. Do you have a fact that is a personal favourite?

&gt;&gt; **DidYouKnowGaming** That's really hard to say. One that sticks with me is that there was a mission in one of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games that confirmed Digletts have feet.

&gt;##3. Do you have a moment in gaming that stuck with you?

&gt;&gt; **DidYouKnowGaming** I remember unwrapping a Nintendo 64 with my brothers for Christmas. We all basically reacted the same way as the ""Nintendo Sixty-foooour"" kid

&gt;##4. Do you have a favourite character from a game?

&gt;&gt; **DidYouKnowGaming** I'm going to have to default on Mario. The guy has never let me down.

&gt;##5. How do you research for facts?

&gt;&gt; **DidYouKnowGaming** The facts in the images are almost always user submitted, then go through and confirm that information (wikis are often wrong regarding a lot of things). Developer interviews are probably the best sources of information, and a lot of them haven't been discussed to any degree online, meaning they have lots of little-known pieces of trivia for the viewers.

&gt;##6. What are your favourite games ever in the world?

&gt;&gt; **DidYouKnowGaming** You're not making this easy for me haha. In no order, Chrono Trigger, Super Metroid, Banjo-Kazooie, Majora's Mask, The Wind Waker, Halo and Mass Effect. I could play any of them for weeks on end.

This subreddit has the [things that make you go ~~hmm~~ vroom.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF2ayWcJfxo) I'm actually surprised how this subreddit has yet to be featured being as awesome as it is. The formula is simple as is all Safe For Work Porn Network™ subreddits. Find a subject matter

You don't even need to be a car buff to enjoy this subreddit. Just a pair of eyes. And some respect for the finest pieces of engineering ever built by man. Oh and bring saliva, classic cars, muscle cars, hybrids, super sports, mid sized sedans, and everything in between.

I would normally give you all 5 examples of some of their best posts. But that would honestly deprive you all of all the other posts. Each one shines in its brilliance. Some more artsy fartsy convincing mumbo jumbo yadda yadda yadda and thats why you all need to check out /r/CarPorn. I honest to god have no more words I can push towards your cake ridden faces to persuade you to check out that subreddit. Speaking of cake, I'd love it if you all wrote in the comments ""But I poop from there."" It'll be our secret code. That will be my birthday present from the internet. 

&gt;#1. What got you into cars?

&gt;&gt;**Jaraxo** I would say it was the same thing that got me into Formula 1. I briefly caught an F1 race back in the mid 90s as a child and fell in love with cars then. I've been a fan of a nice car ever since.

&gt;&gt;**someguyfromcanada** My father grew up in Indianapolis

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** I usually get in by opening the door but some people go through the window.

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** Always been into cars

&gt;#2. Who is your favorite on Top Gear?

&gt;&gt;**Jaraxo** James May without a doubt. He probably has the nicest taste in cars and seems the most normal

&gt;&gt;**someguyfromcanada** N/A

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** When Tom Cruise guest starred because he had a really weird look on his face the whole time.

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** [Jezza](http://i.imgur.com/TvcbW.jpg)

&gt;#3. If you drive one car (without any restrictions) for 1 hour which one would it be? Why?

&gt;&gt;**Jaraxo** I'd probably have to say the [McLaren MP4/4](http://imgur.com/vxCxw), specifically in red down [this](http://i.imgur.com/oRhCG.jpg) road to Monument Valley. I'd put my foot down and blast down there, wind through my hair and it would be awesome. I was going to choose a Ferrari 458 convertible but I thought it's an American road, it's got to be a classic American car.

&gt;&gt;**someguyfromcanada** I will go with the McLaren/Honda MP4/5 which Senna and Prost drove in 1989 (and which I was fortunate enough to see in action at Monaco).

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** [JA51 Jimny 1300.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFIxIy7_doY)

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** Ariel Atom

&gt;#4. If you could change 1 thing on your dream car what would it be? (Besides the price)

&gt;&gt;**Jaraxo** Dream car would probably be Aston Martin DB5. I'd change it so it wasn't so old. I'd like that car with modern reliability and engine power. I'd feel bad thrashing it down the back country roads of England due to fear something would break and I'd kill myself

&gt;&gt;**someguyfromcanada** It wouldn't be my dream car if I had to change anything about it

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** Availability. Suzuki Samurais are very difficult to get in the U.S.

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands** Actually since they start at sub $60k USD Ariel Atom 3's are surprisingly affordable; alas they are not road legal in Canada. Damn you [Stephen Harper!](http://i.imgur.com/a9YSv.gif)

&gt;&gt;**Jaraxo** Actually since they start at sub $60k USD Ariel Atom 3's are surprisingly affordable; alas they are not road legal in Canada. Damn you Stephen Harper!

&gt;&gt;* The Red Bull RB6/7/8 cars. On the one hand Adrian Newey is a car designing god, so I can't help but loathe this car for how good it is.
&gt;&gt;* The Kia Picanto. Seriously, they're awful. It's made even worse by the fact the Kia Rio and Cee'd are considerably better in all areas. I guess Kia can't make a small cheap car to compete with the Peugeot 106 and Toyota Yaris' of this world.
&gt;&gt;* The [FN2 Chassis Honda Civic Type R](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Paris_2006_-_Honda_Civic_type_R.JPG). The Second Generation [EP3 Type R](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/IMFJ_Honda_Civic_Type_R_Gen6.jpg) is one of my favourite cars of all time, but I was met with sheer disappointment. It's one of the ugliest cars I've ever seen, and now the Type R has gone from looking cool and sporty to something you'd expect an old person to drive. It's made worse by the fact the [FD2 Chassis](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/2007_Honda_Civic_TypeR_01.JPG) for the Japanese and Asian markets is actually really nice car.

&gt;&gt;**someguyfromcanada**

&gt;&gt;* The Hummer in civilian dress because a vehicle like that is not designed to be a daily driver.

&gt;&gt;**Jaraxo** A few years ago my mother finally realised her dream of owning a [Morris Minor 1000.](http://classiccarblog.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/morris-minor-1000/morris-minor-1000-buk-265-h.jpg) It was a great little car but required a lot of time and money to keep it running

&gt;&gt;**someguyfromcanada**

&gt;&gt;* Sad: I currently don't even have a car right now as I have been moving back and forth in between countries and am very unstable at the moment.
&gt;&gt;* Fun: As a teenager sometimes in the off-season my friends and I used to ""break into"" the local 1/3 mile oval and race each other around the icy track. Tons of fun and tons of crashes. In hindsight: an absolutely idiotic thing to do.

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** The first time I ever had to jump start a car was for my friend and so I get in position and we pop the hoods and connect everything and I'm standing there wondering what's going wrong and I realized I forgot to turn my car on. I think that's funny *and* sad.

I'm talking about the Dark Tower series, with 

* mutants

* robots

* crazy trains

* big spiders

* and bigger lobsters

mixed in for good measure. What's not to love?

In conclusion: Get started on the series now. Break into a library if you need to. Then come back

MidWorldAwaits

___

&gt;When did you first read the series?

&gt;&gt;I first picked up the series while stationed in South Korea in '04-05. I was a Stephen King fan for quite a few years already but had never read the DT books. A buddy lent me a copy of *The Gunslinger* and we proceeded to race each other to finish the series.

&gt;Could you give a brief description of the series/characters? 

&gt;&gt;I won't even attempt to condense the DT universe into few sentences and pretend they do the series justice.

&gt;&gt;**But...** A man you never fully understand quests to right a world gone terribly wrong, you meet character after character who paint a world eerily like our own.

&gt;&gt;A knight-errant, a young boy and a ""fucked up weasel"" attempt to save the universe, in other words.

&gt;Which character is your favorite and why?

&gt;&gt;Eddie. He's a smart-ass with a heart of gold. I like to think I can relate.

&gt;Which similar works would you recommend to readers?

&gt;&gt;Most of sai King's works contain one or more mentions of the DT universe. (See /r/stephenking)

&gt;&gt;I'm also working my way through the *A Song of Ice and Fire* books at the moment.
King has a son who wrote [a damn fine piece of fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart-Shaped_Box_(novel)) in my opinion. I think it is worth a look.

&gt;What sorts of things are posted to /r/TheDarkTower?

&gt;&gt;All sorts of things. The DT universe is so vast that there is no shortage of things you can run across day-to-day that remind you of the series.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the members of the r/TDT ka-tet?

""Introversion"" by Her.

It's 4:34AM today and I almost forgot that time isn't one of my seasons. 

winter was a really long year and that stain on the floor doesn't melt 

into straight-lined shadows

I really like the warmth of the shade in our first floor windows

you've got curtains in your collar bone and sometimes I wonder if you're lonely

there's a letter on the table that I don't know how to mail 

and the skin on my mouth peels the skin from an apple 

I think she's singing in her sleep again

after all this time there's a certain hint of sadness on your shoulders 

and I dont know which direction it comes from 

...

but I think I feel it too.

&gt;&gt; **Shitty_WaterColour**: While doing my thing, which grew very quickly because I can promote it as I draw.

&gt;2.) Can everyone and anyone pick up a set of premier pencil crayons and post? 
&gt;&gt; **Shitty_WaterColour**: I recently opened it up so that anyone can contribute to the collection, in much the same way that I did. Essentially it's a bit of fun, and gives a pleasant surprise to the person being illustrated. Another reason why I opened it up is because of the massive number of nominations received ([/r/UsernamesNominated](/r/UsernamesNominated)) that I can't hope to make a dent in by myself.

&gt;3.) Would you rather fight a bear with only a knife
&gt;&gt; **Shitty_WaterColour**: My painting skills have been known to pacify even the most ferocious beasts, I'd paint a quick collection of kittens, bunnies, and puppies, which would paralyse them for enough time to paint the real masterpiece: a life-size copy of Quentin Blake's enormous crocodile. By virtue of the photorealistic nature of my work that has manifested particularly in my earlier pieces, the children would be left in such a state of shock that they would turn tail and run.

&gt;4.) Where do you see the community at it's 6th month milestone? Any plans you have for the sub?
&gt;&gt; **Shitty_WaterColour**: I will probably be playing a smaller role in it, it should attract submissions of a higher calibre which can only be a good thing (although who doesn't love the occasional shitty?)

&gt;5.) Would you do your community the honor of drawing a ""Congrats /r/UsernamesIllustrated"" Shitty_Watercolour original? 
&gt;&gt; **Shitty_WaterColour**: [DONE!](http://imgur.com/CpMTt) !

&gt;6.) is there anything else you'd like to say about your community/promote or shamelessly plug?
&gt;&gt; **Shitty_WaterColour**: If I could promote anything, and I might as well throw in a link to my [blog](http://shittywatercolour.com/) here too. Thank you for having us as the subreddit of the day!

/r/AntiJokes, but now that I have, I have the joy of sharing it all with the fans of /r/subredditoftheday. Not too many people were happy with the choice of my last feature, so hopefully I can win over your hearts again with this subreddit.

&gt;##What's your favorite antijoke?

&gt;&gt; **Snookerman** It's of course hard to pick just one

&gt;&gt; &gt;Have you seen Stevie Wonder's new house?

&gt;&gt; &gt;No.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Well

&gt;&gt; &gt;Why can't Michael J. Fox draw perfect circles?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Because it's really difficult.

&gt;##Give us a scenario in which an antijoke would be the perfect way to set the mood.

&gt;&gt; **Snookerman** I think the best time to tell an anti-joke is when people are in a good mood and expect a joke. They will try to figure out the punchline before you finish

&gt;##I see that /r/antijoke has been around for 2 years

&gt;&gt; **Snookerman** For some reason

&gt;##What's in store for the future of /r/antijokes?

&gt;&gt; **Snookerman** Some minor improvements in the design are coming soon. I'll also do my best to advertise the community as much as possible so it can grow and reach more people that like anti-humor.

&gt;##Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Snookerman** Thanks for subscribing and participating. Continue to share good anti-jokes and to rate and comment (be nice). Also try to advertise the community if you can so we can grow and be even better.

You know what the best thing about being a ""writer"" for /r/SubRedditOfTheDay is? (btw I use the term writer very loosely) Its not just the fact that your spreading the good word on communities that are really passionate about their subject matter; its that they invite you to their world with open arms and you see first hand how this group of people no matter how big or small act amongst themselves. Seriously

Atleast thats the case with most subreddits I feature. /r/Comicbooks? Not so much. /r/Comicbooks feels... like home. Not my present bachelor-pad with stereotypically nothing to eat in the fridge

As I grew older so did my tastes in comic books... and reading in general. I have to give a shoutout to [Reading Rainbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow) &amp; [LeVar Burton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeVar_Burton) for ingiting that fire in me to read. But my love for certain comic book characters still remains with me to this day. I really want to keep talking about this

While I have your attention there is a [**comic book donation drive going on!**](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=217799) ofcourse /r/comicbooks is behind it. Seriously can these guys be any cooler? If you missed the [reddit blog](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/02/cause-worthy-of-rallying-lets-get.html?x=y) here it is. Now to the Q &amp; A!

&gt;## 1. What got you into comic books? Why did you create /r/comicbooks?

&gt;&gt; **kublakhan1816** I started reading X-Men and Batman comics as a kid in the 90s because of the two popular cartoons at the time. My buddy and I often biked over to the comic shop and bought comics and trading cards. I fell out of reading comics for a number of years. Then about 2004

&gt;&gt; **andybmcd** The 90s X-men, news, pics from from recent issues, or the recent weekly AMA series with various writers, artists and publishers.

&gt;&gt; **blindsocnerd** Like kublakhan, fell out of it, then started reading again in the mid 2000s. In both instances, it was due to other mediums. In the 1990s, I still had fond memories of the 1989 Batman movie, there were some good cartoons coming out, and I was having fun collecting these baseball cards for comic books characters. In the mid 2000s, along with some other comic book movies

&gt;&gt; **ptbreakeven** I got into comics when I discovered a spinner rack at my local West Coast Video at age 8 and have been reading ever since.

&gt;## 2. Whats your all favorite comic books. Why?

&gt;&gt; **kublakhan1816** My list of favorite books is constantly expanding. If I had to nail down a list, LOVE AND ROCKETS, Y: THE LAST MAN/EX MACHINA would be on it. I'm constantly looking for good stories.

&gt;&gt; **andybmcd** Oh man asking for a top 10 is like asking Hugh Hefner for his top 10. Too much good stuff. Here goes anyways in no particular order
Transhuman, Uncanny X-Force, I Kill Giants, Fear Agent, Checkmate, PunisherMAX, Unknown Soldier (the one by Dysart and Ponticelli)

&gt;&gt; **blindsocnerd** This is a tough question and I'm inevitably going to overlook or leave out a series I absolutely love. That said, Grant Morrison's *Batman* epic, *Chew*, *Hellboy*, *The Invisibles*, *Promethea*, and *Scalped*.

&gt;&gt; **ptbreakeven** I focus mainly on super hero comics

&gt;## 3. How have comic books influenced / altered your life?

&gt;&gt; **kublakhan1816** I guess the answer is yes, and good books. Persepolis is a great comic that, I think, taught me a lot about Iran and its culture. I also find most of Grant Morrison's books very challenging and forces me think about reality itself.

&gt;&gt; **andybmcd** I didn't start reading until I was 20

&gt;&gt; **blindsocnerd** They've certainly changed how I think about movies and television. If a television show is serialized, or reference installments in the distant past or future? How much new information and material is portrayed relative to time use? How do camera angles, motions, and expressions fit within the greater scene or story? How do the directors manipulate your line of vision? All of these questions have parallels within comics. That, and like many great stories, every now and then you'll read a comic that should pose difficult questions, contradict world views

&gt;&gt; **ptbreakeven** Comic books have influenced me tremendously and I think I gravitate to them over other media because the ""actors"" can't ever quit.

&gt;## 4. Comic book guy Best role model or bestest role model? Why?

&gt;&gt; **kublakhan1816** I think Comic Book Guy is an awful role model. He's a characterture of comic book fans. Fat boring middle aged white men who only care about continuity. If you haven't read every comic and if you don't know every character's name

&gt;&gt; **andybmcd** I love Comic Book Guy. He's hilarious and while he does exist in some comic shops

&gt;&gt; **blindsocnerd** I love Comic Book Guy! We actually have a sprite for him, directed at an absurd two-dimensional entity. That, and I kind of view it in terms of parody being the highest form of flattery. Related: see [Our Valued Customers.](http://www.ourvaluedcustomers.blogspot.com/)

&gt;&gt; **ptbreakeven** Comic Book Guy while a hilarious stereotype is not to be emulated.

&gt;## 5. Tell us about your community? What makes you guys so much more special than your average ""the smelly dude behind the counter"" at a comic book store.

&gt;&gt; **kublakhan1816** We try to interact with a lot of the community. We have a weekly reading thread. We try to do a weekly AMA with comic book creators. We have a weekly thread where people talk about what they're picking up. We also interact with people on twitter and facebook. We try to encourage people to talk about comics, all we’ve ever wanted, was a great place to hang out and talk comics.

&gt;&gt; **andybmcd** Kubla covered this pretty well. I think one of the things I'm proud of is that we don't don't have an inherent bias towards any one publisher and we tend to keep some of the weirder

&gt;&gt; **blindsocnerd** First, and I've learned about some great books I wouldn't have considered reading otherwise. Second, I know that it can be an overwhelming and intimidating experience to walk into a comic shop for new or lapsed readers. In some ways, I feel like people are less afraid to ask a ""dumb question"" in an anonymous forum online than in person, especially if they're already familiar with reddit. Third, for better or worse, comic book shops are no longer the central hubs of comic book information. People are increasingly turning to webpages, and online catalogs for consumer information, we all recognize that there are fewer and fewer ""smelly dudes behind the counter."" This isn't because a discovery of hygene, the reading groups

&gt;&gt; **ptbreakeven** The /r/comicbooks community is very welcoming as others have said and it's something we're all very proud of.

&gt;## 6. Tell us a story involving comic books.

&gt;&gt; **andybmcd** Mildly comic book related, but a great time was had by all and we're still friends to this day. [**LINK TO THE ABOVE THREAD!!!**](http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/khc79/to_the_comic_book_reddit_moderator_i_met/)

I do apologize about the late feature - this post got a bit lost in translation. Horrible joke aside...

Languages of the world are disappearing. No, that's for /r/conspiracy).  Out of the estimated ~6000 languages that are thought to be spoken currently worldwide, a vast majority of those languages will potentially become extinct by 2100. No one would speak them any more. All gone.  With all those disappearing languages, ways of communication, portraits of a culture, why then would someone want to make their own language?

People do that? Make their own language? Yes, secrets, as part of a fictional world, to be used for international languages - lots of things. It's just a great hobby for many to explore linguistics and how languages are put together.

Really, it's a fun hobby. Making languages won't prevent others from going extinct, and it's just fun. 

To get a better idea of what's involved

&gt;##What is a conlang?

&gt;&gt;A constructed language (conlang for short) is simply a language made up for some reason.


&gt;##What is /r/conlangs?

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** It's a community for those who conlang (that is, but isn't necessary. Even those who only know one language fluently can still be successful in creating their own.

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** There's a great community for sharing progress in conlang development or asking questions if you get stuck. Even for those who have no clue where to go


&gt;##How do you even start?

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** To say there's a ""right"" way to go about making a language would lead to controversy. There are different ways, the first thing to do would be to decide on the sounds of the language. Once you have what sounds you want to be able to use in the language, you can establish a form of writing (or this can come later - writing isn't technically necessary for a language). From there, it's a matter of putting things together: sounds, units of meaning (""words""), sentences, etc. It gets difficult to explain concisely.

&gt;&gt;**Ienpw_III:**  I generally start as LGBTerrific suggests. However
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nga homiatta barevat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ogan sakura homiat.

&gt;&gt;Above the words at the ends of the sentences both end in -at. So maybe this conlang has a fixed word order and requires the subject of the sentence to go at the end (being marked with an -at). Nga and ogan are fairly short compared to the other words, homiatta and homiat are almost the same, so one is probably a derived form of the other. So maybe the first sentence means something like ""I cut the cake"", and the second means ""She brought the knife"". And, of course, I change and add things as I go.


&gt;##Are there any famous conlangs?

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** Yes! While most conlangs probably are only seen by their creators, there have been some very well known conlangs that have had great impact. The most popular one being Esperanto, a language whose intent was to a secondary language people would learn to foster international communication on a neutral basis (no bias speaking a language that's native to your country, for example, or fewer/no issues from translations). Other popular conlangs exist in fictional worlds: Klingon from Star Trek or the languages from Middle Earth.


&gt;##Why would anyone want to create their own language? What do they hope to accomplish?

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** Reasons vary

&gt;&gt;**Ienpw_III:** For me, so I'm rather shy about sharing them. But I really should.


&gt;##What do conlangs look like?

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** Conlangs might be created to mimic existing/natural languages, as if a relative of an existing language. Others will be designed with completed unrelated purposes for an alien race. There are all kinds of possibilities here, especially when you take into account that many conlangers also create their own writing system to go along with their language (but again, writing isn't necessary).

&gt;&gt;**Ienpw_III:** What do natural languages look like! And then some! (Klingon was designed to resemble real languages as little as possible.) Creating writing systems is definitely popular

&gt;##*I have no idea what I'm doing! Help!*

&gt;&gt;**Ienpw_III:** Aside from the [Language Construction Kit](http://www.zompist.com/kit.html), as are North American, Asian...

It’s pretty likely you’ve seen an animated gif if you’re on Reddit, /r/creepy_gif are here to show you that gif viewing doesn’t need to be all cutesy cute and flower arrangements, no, there are lots of people that would rather spend their time looking at gifs purely to make the hairs on their necks stand up, invoke itchy skin or to feel as if there is an unseen presence in the room.

[*Creak creak creak*](http://imgur.com/n9w925f

Becoming more and more engulfed into /r/creepy_gif and their catalogue of animated images that cause unsettling feelings in my over-active brain and pants. I contacted them

[Oh god.](http://imgur.com/n9w925f

&gt;##1. How did /r/creepy_gif come to be?

&gt;&gt; **MickCJ** I like scary movies, IronZeppelin was the first to introduce me to Reddit about two years ago. He showed me /r/Creepy and I thought it was an awesome idea. My first successful post was on there. Needless to say, my favorite posts on /r/Creepy were the gifs, something about them is just creepier, I think it’s the fact that they move and can build suspense unlike a still photo. From there I decided to make a community just for those posts.

&gt;&gt; **jjc543** MickCJ told me about his idea of having a subreddit just for scary gifs, we created the subreddit.

&gt;##2. What is the aim of /r/creepy_gif?

&gt;&gt; **MickCJ** The aim? To scare you and creep you out. It’s supposed to be a fun subreddit

&gt;&gt; **jjc543** The subreddit is supposed to provide a place where people can try and scare each other a bit in a fun and thrilling way. I know that myself and each of the mods enjoy scary movies. We're always trying to find something that could actually scare us. We hope that this subreddit can provide this on a much larger scale.

&gt;##3. Do you have a creepiest creepy gif?

&gt;&gt; **MickCJ** [I do have a creepiest creepy gif](http://i.imgur.com/jYvpw.gif). When I first saw it I was lying in bed browsing Reddit on the phone around 1AM. Something about it gets to me.

&gt;&gt; **jjv543** [This gif](http://i.imgur.com/vgvK0.gif) made me incredibly uncomfortable the first time I saw it. It's also one of the higher posts on /r/creepy_gif

&gt;##4. What do you think draws people to your subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **MickCJ** I think people are drawn to /r/Creepy_Gif for the same reason people go to see scary movies or ride roller coasters; people love suspense and being on the edge of their seat. I mean

&gt;&gt; **jjc543** I really have to agree with MickCJ, to me.

&gt;##5. Have you ever had a real life experience of something creepy?

&gt;&gt; **MickCJ** Personally

&gt;&gt; **jjc543** The creepiest real life thing that has ever happened to me, particularly in the bedroom in which I was sleeping. One night I woke up to a woman in old fashioned clothing rocking in a rocking chair with a baby in her arms. Scared the hell out of me.

&gt;##6. And is there anything you’d like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **MickCJ** I love our subscribers, aim to make it the best and most creepy subreddit we can. This means all of our subscribers have a say in what happens on the subreddit. So a big thanks goes to our subscribers! 

&gt;&gt; **jjc543** Thank you for helping us grow this awesome subreddit! They have really been great about making suggestions and providing input that could help better the page.

**windmilltheory:** I started the subreddit when subreddits were a new thing, while still dealing whith the mod list and mod messages.


&gt;##2. do you bake ? if yes what's the best thing you bake ? :D
&gt;&gt;**hailtheface:** Yes, but the best is whatever just came out of the oven.  
**windmilltheory:** Best thing baked is spiced artisan bread. 

&gt;##3. is there something that you always wanted to bake but never started ?
&gt;&gt;**hailtheface:** There are many things I'd like to do and I enjoy this subreddit and a few others as sources of inspiration.  
**windmilltheory:** Always wantwd to try a baked souffle

&gt;##4. who according to you is the best baker you have ever seen ? what set them apart ? :D
&gt;&gt;**hailtheface:** Depends what you're talking about. Jeffrey Hamelman is the dude when it comes to bread in my mind. There are so many great people out there doing amazing things though in various specialties it's impossible to say.  
**windmilltheory:**  Best bakers are those with precision and knowhow. Us other plebs just slap some ingridients together and throw it in an oven.



&gt;##5. is there something you want to say to your present/future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**hailtheface:** I just hope people keep pushing themselves to try new things. Try to look at big picture things and don't get bogged down by the details
**windmilltheory:** ...hello!

**5 reasons why lists are interesting.**

1.  Say you're sharing something cool from the internet with your mate.  Well you've got a captive audience so slap 4 more interesting stories to your first one.  Come for the video of the guy befriending a tiger

2.  Got a point?  Something to say?  Nothing makes your argument more solid than a list!  So Charlize?  Are you listening 'cause I got 5 reasons why I'm your huckleberry!

3.  Become an instant authority.  If you can make a list about some topic, listing things you *can* kiester just makes you a guy that shoves things up his ass.

4.  To start a discussion or a fistfight.  What's that Rolling Stone magazine?  *Drive* was the best movie of 2011?  Looks like someone missed Phineas and Ferb Across the 2nd Dimension!  By the way

5.  Lists bring you back for more!  Oh cracked.com

And so my dear friends, laughs, porn, pictures of cats, rage comics, advice animals or things to look at while smoking marijuana, this place offers the same payout as far as time spent vs. entertainment value.  My favourite part about this subreddit?  Nearly every post is interesting!  You can't really say that about most subreddits ([/r/subredditoftheday](/r/subredditoftheday) fits into that category as well

So it's like this, index or anthologize this lot.  Hmmm.  That's a boob scratcher.

I'll be the first to admit that I am a bit of a media junkie. Daily, audio recordings, videos, short-films, discussion threads and websites. Why? Because we live in the information age and I have insatiable desire to know a little about a lot! Plus, I am currently unemployed (soon to change?) so, I have the disposable time. 

As with anything you practice over long periods of time, I tend to lean on my left leg towards the wall of the shower. Not sure why, I just do. As for my media consumption, I have recently found myself seeking out informative and well made *documentaries.* 

Documentaries are, no doubt, to see someone present information on a subject which they found interesting enough to film. It allows you to see the world from their perspective and absorb information while absorbing alcohol into your bloodstream on the couch. Need examples of good documentaries! Boom. On it. 

* *Paris is Burning* - This documentary follows Drag Queens from New York in the late 80's as vouge

* *The Devil Came on Horseback* - As the conflict in Darfur reached it peak in the te mid-to late 2000's a young man commissioned to observe as report provides a gruesome

* *This American Life* - Although it is not a feature film

[r/Documentaries](/r/Documentaries) is a community purposed with helping people access information through film and art. Although they have a wide user-base and have been in business for quite sometime, but you gotta risk-it to get the biscuit, if you know what I mean. Most films are between 45 minutes and 2 hours, so instead of watching shitty re-runs of Family Guy and American Dad (yeah I went there), educate AND entertain yourself.

**325 MTV freaks for 3 (almost 4!) years!**

When I say [""The 80's""](http://i.imgur.com/E7okJN5.gif) what comes to mind first?

Depending on where you are from in the world

[The 80's](http://i.imgur.com/pOHearD.gif) was the kind of musical decade unlike anything before for one reason: [MTV.](http://i.imgur.com/B5XoAa9.gif) Launched on August 1, [Michael Jackson](http://i.imgur.com/C7ehuZg.gif), [Prince](http://i.imgur.com/HpNrqww.gif), [Whitney Houston](http://i.imgur.com/sBzLx1R.gif),and [Madonna](http://i.imgur.com/A4XxySo.gif) and learn all sorts of perverted things. Especially from [Weird Al](http://i.imgur.com/AIyFbVM.gif). 

[Hip Hop's golden age](http://i.imgur.com/5gG6EM8.gif) occured in the last half of the decade, and Eminem. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five paved the way for 2 Live Crew, Public Enemy, and Run D.M.C to really propel the genre to new heights of [popularity.](http://i.imgur.com/CyLTaaB.jpg) People even started doing [the Worm.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lchOa6fIbHI)  

Of course New Wave bears a mention as possibly the most [quintessential 80's pop music genre.](http://i.imgur.com/qHrPM5G.gif) Talking Heads and Blondie are two names which became legend and are the most [recognizable](http://i.imgur.com/YP4d2eA.gif) early New Wave bands. Duran Duran, but you still see it's influences in groups like Coldplay, The Killers, and Interpol. 

[Late in the decade](http://i.imgur.com/yfSt44k.gif) you started to see the emergence of the sound that would drive the 90's, and Sonic Youth all became popular in the 80's, prior to the emergence of [Nirvana](http://i.imgur.com/c9nSgDb.gif) and Pearl Jam. 

/r/80smusic has a troubled history. It was abandoned by it's creator and  in obscurity for the first 3 years of it's life. Then the visionary /u/redtaboo had the inspiration to [redditrequest](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/pkc8c/id_like_to_take_over_80s_music_please/) the ailing forum and begin it's drive towards becoming the top 80's subreddit (except for /r/80s and /r/80sproblems

I got together with the other mods to work on our [Safety Dances](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=so-c8Erh5Jc) and talk about what makes them tick:

&gt; What's your background with 80's music? Did you love it since you were a kid or were you an 80's pop star??

&gt;&gt;**dzneill:** I was born in 1984

&gt;&gt;**[redtaboo:](http://i.imgur.com/WWzC7t0.gif)** I was an 80's kid! I loved every minute of it; and the music was and is the best part!

&gt;&gt;**wasabiface:** I think for me it comes with my heritage. I've never met an asian that didn't like 80's music. Maybe it's because it goes so well with Karaoke.

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol:** I don't mean to brag but I had a pretty popular number in Burundi.

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** Born in the late 70's, Was (Not Was), Fleetwood Mac, Dire Straits, Tina Turner, and Blondie. My sister and I would put on air band concerts for our relatives. I tried to do a reunion concert at the dinner table this past christmas but I was swiftly rebuked.

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** I was born in 1981, so I really liked him when I was a kid. Thanks to MTV (and my aunt) I discovered Guns N' Roses, Motley Crue, Warrant, Poison, Skid Row... I grew up listening to a lot of good shit IMO.

&gt;&gt;**noonches:** I was the shouting guy in the B-52's

&gt; Who is your favourite 80's artist?

&gt;&gt;**dzneill:** Gotta go with [Bad Religion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_religion) I love them to this day.

&gt;&gt;**[redtaboo:](http://i.imgur.com/WWzC7t0.gif)** bah... not a fair question! Probably cliche

&gt;&gt;**wasabiface:** I have way too many favorites, Run DMC, Cure, Bruce Springsteen.....

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol:** [Oingouran Boinguran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oingo_Boingo)

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** A brutally difficult question. In terms of quality and quantity of material its gotta be Hall and Oates

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** Guns N' Roses is my all-time favorite band

&gt;&gt;**noonches:** Van Halen

&gt; What are the submission rules of this subreddit? Do you have any comment rules?

&gt;&gt;**dzneill:** Its a subreddit for music made in the 1980's. Not much to it. As far as comments go

&gt;&gt;**[redtaboo:](http://i.imgur.com/WWzC7t0.gif)** music. From the 80's. we're a simple folk

&gt;&gt;**wasabiface:** Come on in and contribute - don't be a douche.

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol:** If it's not 80's music then you probably shouldn't be submitting it. This is a hate free zone.

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** Submit 80's music and don't be a dick. Pretty simple.

&gt; If you could go back in time

&gt;&gt;**dzneill:** The [Slap Braclet.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_bracelet) I think I could have made a ton of money off those silly things.

&gt;&gt;**[redtaboo:](http://i.imgur.com/WWzC7t0.gif)** hah... started? It's entirely possible I still take [fashion cues from Punky Brewster](http://i.imgur.com/JYFaU.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**wasabiface:** Not sure but my favorite fashion trend from the 80's would be mini skirts. God i love a hot chick in a mini skirt :)

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol:** Does it have to be an actual trend? I'd want to make up a new trend

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** I love fingerless gloves

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** Neon mesh tanktops. I still wear them every day.

&gt;&gt;**noonches:** Flock of seagulls haircuts

&gt; What's your all time favourite 80's tune? ONLY ONE ALLOWED!!

&gt;&gt;**dzneill:** At this very moment it'd have to be [The KKK Took My Baby Away](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT1OKo1rT84) by The Ramones. Because The Ramones are LEGEND.

&gt;&gt;**[redtaboo:](http://i.imgur.com/WWzC7t0.gif)** [I think we're Alone Now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Q3mHyzn78) because, btw.)

&gt;&gt;**wasabiface:** At the moment it's [Last Night a DJ Saved My Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtfZbj4J71A) by Indeep. That song is groovy man!

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol:** It's a between [Dead Man's Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iypUpv9xelg) and [Is There Something I Should Know.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB-Crjeqa5M) It might lean more towards Is There Something I Should Know because I love that line: don't say you're easy on me

&gt;&gt;**soupyhands:** Another difficult question. To narrow it down to just one kills me

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** [Poison - Talk Dirty to Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCChxBSRo1Y)

&gt;&gt;**noonches:** [867-5309 Jenny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axLRUszuu9I)

&gt; Anything you care to add?

&gt;&gt;**dzneill:** Come on by and share your favorite tunes!

&gt;&gt;**[redtaboo:](http://i.imgur.com/WWzC7t0.gif)** dance when you visit us

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol:** Shameless plug: /r/hiphopworldwide. Also check out the sidebar because if the 80's aren't your thing there's a subreddit for just about every decade.

Have you thanked your toaster today?  Whether it made you toast, a Toaster Strudel, or even warmed up the Pop Tart you didn’t want to eat cold, there’s a good chance your toaster was there for you in your time of need.

And there you are

/r/ToasterRights is a subreddit dedicated to the rights of toasters.  These once great appliances are being run out of kitchens everywhere by its enemy the microwave

I sat down with the /r/ToasterRights mod team to find out what it is that I can do to make the world a better place for the appliance that makes my Toaster Strudel so flaky and warm.

&gt;#1. What inspired you to take on the cause of toaster rights?

&gt;&gt;**THE_HUMAN_TREE** It was originally started when someone suggested in a comment thread that a man should be able to marry his Toaster. [Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xkml6/i_recently_saw_an_ad_thanking_me_for_not/c5nbqdw?context=3) I completely agreed

&gt;&gt;**cupcakes_23** Whenever there's an issue as serious as the abuse of toasters

&gt;#2. Why is the microwave the enemy?  How do you feel about toaster ovens?

&gt;&gt;**THE_HUMAN_TREE** Microwaves are not good. Yes, but it does it very well. A toaster oven is our close cousin. See our sister sub, /r/toasterovenclub

&gt;&gt;**cupcakes_23** Microwave ovens don't understand how easy they have it! They get regularly cleaned, on the other hand, are very helpful and kind to toasters, easing their immense workload.

&gt;#3. How do you feel about modded toasters?  Like the toaster that was converted into a playable NES?

&gt;&gt;**THE_HUMAN_TREE** Once a toaster has passed

&gt;&gt;**cupcakes_23** Modded toasters are completely fine as long as it is respectable to the toaster it once was. It's a totally different issue when toasters are destroyed or harmed posthumously.

&gt;#4. Inquiring minds have to know – what is your favorite thing to toast?

&gt;&gt;**THE_HUMAN_TREE** Bread. It's the greatest thing since slic...wait a minute!

&gt;&gt;**cupcakes_23** I'm pretty partial to bagels to be honest. I once found a smashed toaster on the ground and I nursed it back to health to the point where it could toast 6 bagel halves at once. It was a sad day when that toaster passed on.

&gt;#5. What can I do to make the world a better place for toasters?

&gt;&gt;**THE_HUMAN_TREE** You can help promote the cause! Report toaster abuse when you see it. If you see anything

&gt;&gt;**cupcakes_23** You can spread awareness of this issue! So many people are unaware of the harm they are doing to toasters

Today's special subreddit is one near and dear to me: /r/HorseMask (not to be confused with its NSFW cousin

Just kidding. I've never actually heard of this subreddit before /r/Random took me there

I mean, and [this classy mutha-fucka](http://i.imgur.com/Mw33T.gif)? Nowhere, that's right, except for this quirky little sub. 

""What the hell am I looking at?!"" you may be asking yourself.

Horse masks have been an oddly hilarious internet phenomenon since approx. 2007

But where they came from is besides the point. Horse masks represent something *more* than just an alternative to Guy Fawkes masks. They're a way of life
 

I know you're just chomping at the bit now to know more about this excellent subreddit


&gt;1 - What inspired you to create/mod r/HorseMask?

&gt;&gt;**Horse_Glue_Knower** I bought a horse mask and wanted to share it with the world. Nothing really more than that. I laugh every time I put it on. It's always funny.

&gt;2 - I've seen horse masks around Reddit before

&gt;&gt;**Horse_Glue_Knower** I had seen them around quite a bit too

&gt;3 - What's your all time favorite r/HorseMask post?

&gt;&gt;**Horse_Glue_Knower** Personally

&gt;4 - Do you own a horse mask? If so

&gt;&gt;**Horse_Glue_Knower** Are you kidding me?? - http://i.imgur.com/hSPG0.jpg

&gt;5 - What advice do you have for aspiring horse mask-ers? 

&gt;&gt;**Horse_Glue_Knower** Just embrace the lack of view from inside the mask and build up of sweat and just go for it. Also

&gt;&gt;As for funny posts,, like rowing a boat or playing basketball or be in public.

&gt;6 - Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Horse_Glue_Knower** So long and thanks for all the neighs.

Thanks for the great interview

**791** Soda Jerks for **2 years**!

I love soda.  I don’t make a secret of that.  Circle K Thirstbusters or Polar Pops or whatever they’re calling them these days are heaven-sent.  If you save your cup, there are many delicious sodas out there.  Even I need to change it up once in awhile with some root beer or Dr. Thunder.  Yes, I said Dr. Thunder – I may have the sophistication of a redneck, but I am very snobby about my soda choice.

/r/soda is dedicated to all sodas and soda related things, [Salty Watermelon Pepsi](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/253156_286670278101486_89162301_n.jpg) and a discussion on how [Crystal Pepsi](http://www.reddit.com/r/Soda/comments/1353oz/i_miss_crystal_pepsi_twenty_year_anniversary/) is missed.  They even discuss soda tasting parties.  Oh, I suppose you Coke-heads think I should post something Coke related to be fair.

Well

Okay

I sat down with the /r/soda mods to ask them questions about their wonderful subreddit.

&gt;#1. What made you want to be part of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** I actually found the subreddit abandoned! I thought it would be fun to be a mod

&gt;#2. Is there anything in particular you expect from the community?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** One thing I love about this community is its steady growth and enthusiasm for all things carbonated. I always enjoy seeing posts about people wanting to learn how to make their own soda

&gt;#3. Do you have a favorite soda?  What is it?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** If I had to choose a favorite name brand soda

&gt;#4. Do you think soda wars are tearing apart the fabric of our society?
&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** These so called ""soda wars"" are just a fabrication of the Big Coffee industry to keep our eyes from the truth that coffee is trying to invade and take over our way of life! Wake up

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** Finding this sub and watching it grow to 25 times its size over the past 2 years has felt a lot like what Rick Moranis felt in [Honey

Just when you thought the [TV gods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=kRH3zcHEN5w#t=30s) couldn't get any more desperate. What with bad reality shows coming out the [Whoo-Ah!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43yi14OVxkM) and more shows about [singing teenage drama queens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=sp34qAMIKFA#t=45s) than one man can handle... They rolled the dice and gave Tina Fey a tv show of her own in 2006. Surprisingly

30ROCK has an all star cast with Tina Fey as Liz Lemon who is a SNL type show director and low hygiene lady person in general. Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy, Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan as Tracy Morgan playing himself... well you get the point. What I'm getting at is that no one is under performing to say the least. Each character on the show has a rich deep background. Not to mention the guest stars who fit in like a glove.

I hope I'm not over hyping it but 30ROCK is Sorta like /r/ArrestedDevelopment but with a more zany and mainstream feel to it. Unlike AD

This is one of those shows you get a big bucket of popcorn, unless you just want to fight the man. In this case the man being ~~Reagan~~ (Sorry, I was thinking of [Black Dynamite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=3uUDMR_-tUk#t=119s)) Lorne Michaels.

I haven't gotten the chance to ask the mods for /r/30ROCK questions. Might as well ask the fan base.

&gt;1. What episode hooked you into the series? Why?

&gt;2. What is your favorite episode so far? Brief summary?

&gt;3. Who is your favorite character and what is their most surprising scene?

You know when my dad completed his college degree the chances he would get a job was over a 100% today I see many college students not getting a job after they finish college thus making them work in smaller income jobs which are no way relevant to their major. Why did this happen ? Is it because of more competition ? less quality in education ? no job left ? recession ? or is some other factor(s) which you can think of ? i guess its a little bit of everything.

In today's job market, having a global education and deepening your knowledge. Yes. Grad schools or higher education do the trick. I know that many might critique me saying that we shouldnt do masters for just getting a job but i believe that in today's competitive world to have a step forward we need to have one. Its purely my opinion. Of course i wouldnt suggest you to do PhD for just getting a job since it requires a lot of time money and should be done for people who have genuine interest in research. Thus before choosing our program we should know what our requirements and interests are.

Knowledge is power. The more you have, MBA or PhD for example. But always remember you need to choose which you wont regret later on. 

There are various schools all over the world for students. Many students travel abroad for just studying. Education has become one of the top businesses itself today. Even getting admissions to the top ones is very difficult today. I know I know everyone wants to party in their undergrad. I did too. But know your limits. Dont let your grades go low. You may not realize it now but its **very fucking** important in the future .. Oh well you will have lot of time to think about that! :D

Enjoy while you can folks! :D

Here's an awesome interview with the mods of both the subs!!!
(note: The answers from /r/gradschool will be us soon)  


First its /r/highereducation !

&gt;##1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**nowell:** I work in higher education and noticed that the sub hadn't been created. There's such a strong inclination to share information in higher education circles
**MikePetroff:** I've been involved in the higher education community in some capacity for over a decade. I feel that higher education, their different perspectives on current topics, and staying current on the issues that face higher education as it moves into new territories.

&gt;##2. Why do you think higher education/grad schooling is important ?
&gt;&gt;**wesumd:**  Higher education, and by no means is that unimportant, students come from all over the world to study in American institutions of higher education because they are searching for a mechanism for a career, a mechanism for social uplift, business and friendship connections, and undoubtedly, a sense of self.  
Abroad, Sweden, Australia, Saudi Arabia, etc., all of these countries, whether they are developed or ""developing"" economies, the same is true in the United States as well
Probably the most telling ""sign of the times"" in higher education is the isomorphism
Last, drive local economies, promote new technologies and cures for diseases, and even make food supplies more robust in times of need. The current political landscape, in my opinion, reflects the need to address the growing cost as it impacts the accessibility of the higher education phenomenon and is also an indicator to my position that colleges and universities are wide-reaching and recognized in their states and regions.  
**LawAndMortar:**  Higher education is often the last concerted effort to help improve the next generation. It's how we construct a better future, higher education is still one of the best places for 18-year-olds to come make mistakes and figure things out before becoming completely independent. It's not exactly a ""training ground before real life,"" but it's a place to explore things, take risks and know that (in most case) there's a soft landing waiting if things don't work out. Some days my job is to make sure that landing isn't too soft, but you get the point.


&gt;##3. What are some basic things that one should know who is aspiring for higher education ?
&gt;&gt;**LawAndMortar:**  Apparently this is the unpopular question. If I had to condense down whatever wisdom I have in to two things, it's just that people seem to forget about the places they can get great answers from.  
Aside from that, that means remembering that we may have different ideas about the goal of higher education and the function of our individual universities. I'm usually more concerned with personal development and literacy skills than specific content knowledge, but there are people who focus on the exact opposite and we can't always afford to just each do our own thing and hope it works out. That's not something I'm always good at, personally, but it's a basic thing that everyone should know.


&gt;##4. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**MikePetroff:** Feel free to take advantage of the wealth of knowledge available within the subreddit, to thought-leaders, to technologists. There will likely be someone to converse with or learn from if you share your ideas and opinions.  

Have an awesome weekend folks! :D

First a geography lesson: [this](http://i.imgur.com/OVHWJ.gif) is the United Kingdom (or The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). [This](http://i.imgur.com/VLSZj.jpg) is England. [This](http://i.imgur.com/hNY6P.gif) is Scotland. [This](http://i.imgur.com/f5m2U.jpg) is Wales. And [this](http://www.nidex.com/images/MAP1.jpg) is Northern Ireland. Altogether they are the United Kingdom and when you throw Ireland into the mix they are the [British Isles](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Atlantic_Archipelago.jpg). Great Britain

Britain is a really beautiful country and thus has some really beautiful pictures. You've got the [Isle of Skye](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcdead/7830078788/sizes/l/in/photostream/), [villages and towns](http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterribbeck/5998565520/sizes/l/in/photostream/), and [fields of Dover](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mendhak/4682393073/sizes/l/in/photostream/) (not THE fields of Dover). It looks great in the [summer time](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ugardener/2586136121/sizes/l/in/photostream/) and the [winter time](http://www.flickr.com/photos/raymond0/6939265581/sizes/l/in/photostream/) and [everything in between](http://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanbob/7088286869/sizes/l/in/photostream/). If you like rolling, lush landscapes, towering monsters peaking over urban landscapes, or a quaint little village in the country then look no further because Britain has got it all. 

&gt;##1. Why did you create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;    /u/BritishEnglishPolice I made it to start filtering out the images and memes that started to infest /r/unitedkingdom. We'll slowly move the content across so /r/uk becomes less of an imageboard and more of what it was meant to be.

&gt;&gt;    /u/Skuld  A passive measure to hopefully encourage /r/unitedkingdom to move some images over. They have started to explode with karma as the subreddit has grown (they keep hitting /r/all)

&gt;##2. What's your favorite picture of Britain?

&gt;&gt;    /u/Skuld [Pink Floyd's Animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pink_Floyd-Animals-Frontal.jpg) album cover

&gt;&gt;    /u/sjhill [Glencoe](http://www.reddit.com/r/britpics/comments/13uie6/glencoe_scotland_by_night/) because I love the place, and my brother in law served with the RAF.

&gt;##3. What's your most hated picture of Britain?

&gt;&gt;    /u/sjhill [Tesco sandwich](http://www.reddit.com/r/britpics/comments/11msya/is_there_nothing_tesco_wont_sandwich/)

&gt;##4. Are pictures of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Pitcairn Islands, or Turks and Caicos Islands allowed?

&gt;&gt;    /u/BritishEnglishPolice Yes. :)

**Happy Father's Day!!**

We at Subreddit of the Day, we have floated a theory that yesterday's moderator, PotatoMusicBinge, was conceived in a dumpster behind a fertility clinic... a bizarre scenario involving cross pollination when someone mixed two trash bags together, but yeah, most of us have at one time known our dads.  Sadly theBinge only knew the love of a naked 40watt bulb hanging from a wire in his closet of shame, but look at me getting away from myself again!

Ah yes, I have three but only two are beautiful, I feel qualified to pass on the following which may come up at my custody hearing...

**SRotD's Top 5 Parenting Tips**

**First tip** is called ""the floor"".  As a parent of a shiny new baby, you will ask yourself this question several times an hour.  I mean, he doesn't move much so you can probably just go back to playing Civ 5 right?  No.  No my brother you need to get on the floor.  And the coolest thing will happen - once you're on the floor everything will come to you and you can find the answers to all the questions you have about what to do as a parent.

But when does it stop?  When do you stop getting on the floor?  That is something I don't know.  I've been getting down on the floor with my kids for the past 8 1/2 years and I don't think I've ever walked away feeling like I wasn't the best god damn dad on the planet!  I especially enjoy doing this when I'm at the end of my rope and I'm about to lose my patience.  Someday I'd like to meet that guy who was all homicidal when he ran out of rope and coined that specific phrase.  Man that guy must've been intense!

**Second tip** is to listen.  I know, LOVE to talk!  Believe me, there's a much better way... listen to your kids.  Let 'em squeal, shriek, cry, whine, beg, shout

**Third tip**, cut down your reddit time!  (Unless it's coming to /r/subredditoftheday or /r/daddit).  I ask this of you because sadly we have a finite number of days with our kids, so let's make the most of ever moment!

**Fourth tip**, ""that's my child, and he/she looks up to me.""  Remind yourself that no matter what, regardless of what's been said or done, that child totally, unconditionally looks up to you.  And whether you like it or not, you're a hero

**Fifth tip**, people have been trying to be perfect parents.  There's no such thing by the way, but what you do have is a world of resources out there.  You got friends and family to help you out, but more importantly, you should subscribe to today's subreddit of the day, /r/daddit!!
 
Here with the full story is *daskoon*

&gt;&gt;Intro first, some not so much) and pigferret thought that I was into it so much that he packed it in and left for 'fart jokes' (actually he said he was looking to back off of the modding thing because he wanted to have more time for his real life, or something along those lines) so here I am.

&gt;&gt;Alright

&gt;Outside of baby photos

&gt;&gt;Well, discussions, rants, questions, and now, as part of my changes, I've starting a voting system. Really only have one or two active votes right now, that way it's nifty. A dad would then be able to ask ""hm... what's daddit's opinion on binkies"" for instance

&gt;What's the goal? Do you feel like you're close to the mark after one year?

&gt;&gt;The goal is to get together and talk about dad stuff, nerd or neuro-atypical dads."" Moms are also welcome, but just announce yourself, like we do in /r/mommit (lol, jk). We also welcome dads-to-be and usually about once or twice a week get a ""I'm freakin' out please help"" kind of post, which are replied to in turn with a range of differing advice that I find kinda warms me in the cockles of my heart. Maybe even in the sub-cockle region, maybe the liver, even though I can't (and won't) take credit from the subscribers as I've only been on board for 11 days

&gt;Tell us about you and your qualifications as /r/daddit's main mod! i.e. tell us about your kids!

&gt;&gt;My little monster is 2, Nathan, is due to be sprung from my wife on the 3rd of July, so cheers to that! I don't know too much about him though, other than he gets the hiccups a lot.

&gt;What's your top three parenting tips?

&gt;&gt;Look, so many of my tips may or may not apply to those of you with older children.

&gt;&gt;Don't ask, the other does not.

&gt;&gt;Don't try to reason with a 2 year old. Just don't even try it. They don't quite get logic. Don't get me wrong

&gt;&gt;Communicate Look I need to tag out and tag my wife in for the next round of parenting, and vice-versa? Kids are sneaky little buggers and they like to try to test their boundaries. ""Mom said no cookies... but what about dad?"" If I'm not in the loop, ""Sure here ya go kiddo, have a cookie.""

&gt;Last paragraph is yours - what would you like to say to your subscribers?!

&gt;&gt;I've rambled on enough, please use the newly re-added suggestion box on the sidebar if you have any suggestions for anything.

**4.004** Paintballers on the battlefield for **4 years**

A couple of months ago I had my first paintball experience. I expected to be running in the frontline
Instead of that

* Paintball is most enjoyable when playing with stragic and teamwork. Epic moment and adrenaline kicks guaranteed. 

* I also learnt that, nothing good will happen. You will end up ~~crying~~ sitting behind a wall, knowing that your opponents are coming and that their bullets are flying faster than you expected. 

But even after all this I still can't wait to play it again. I would actually love watching this mod team play paintball together. There will be more action than [after putting all the action heroes in one building](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764651/) .That's going to be a game I wanna watch twice. *That's* a game I wanna watch 4 times. Check that. I would watch that game

*So how about the subreddit?*

As a veteran, tricks, pictures of your guns or gear.       
As a starter you will get helped by the many subscribers. 


Its just for everyone who loves paintball.


Now an interview with the kind moderators of /r/Paintball!

&gt;##1. How was your first experience with paintball like?
&gt;&gt;    **eclipse2086**    Lots of fun. When I was 14
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **BonesJackson**    Confusing and exciting. I was 13 and purchased a crappy Brass Eagle Tigershark ($90 gun of the 1990s) and had very little clue as to what I was doing. I put on my mom's old leather motorcycle jacket because I was afraid of getting hurt, and I don't think I hit anyone. Had a great time though. Completely exhilarating.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **sk33t**    Fun

&gt;##2. What do you like the most about paintball?
&gt;&gt;    **eclipse2086**    The adrenaline rush right before the first match at a tournament and the comradery you develop with your teammates. And of course
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **BonesJackson**    Shooting someone before they shoot you. This is the same reason I pretty much only play multiplayer videogames with pvp. I love the thrill of besting someone
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **sk33t** Shooting stuff

&gt;##3. Do you prefer outside or inside? Why?
&gt;&gt;    **eclipse2086**    I prefer to play outside because I like playing in the sunlight rather than playing under the glow of florescent lights in an indoor field.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **BonesJackson**    Outside
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **sk33t**    Outside

&gt;##4. What is your favorite style of play?
&gt;&gt;    **eclipse2086**    Speedball/Tournament
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **BonesJackson**    These days probably recball/woodsball. I will happily play speedball as well
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **sk33t**    The one where you shoot people

&gt;##5. What does this community provide?
&gt;&gt;    **eclipse2086**    This community provides paintball players of all styles to discuss and show off why they love to play this game. It also helps out those who are new to the sport of paintball.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **BonesJackson**    I've been actively trying to reshape the community since I started posting here. On a general catch-all information site like Reddit
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **sk33t**    I dunno

&gt;##6. Anything you'd like to say? 
&gt;&gt;    **eclipse2086**    Thanks for featuring /r/paintball. And
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    **BonesJackson**    To paraphrase a poignant quote in a paintball video
&gt;

Getting mother fucking disciplined is the hardest thing to do. For example, and read a book for an hour.

So the book thing lasted about a month, and I was supposed to go on this low carb, high protein diet. After a week of continuous grilled chicken, I was over that diet.

Ya well

I predict, this is America, so I just might get my own show about it.

Speaking of shows

&gt;##1. Only a month old

&gt;&gt;**TheCourageWolf** [This was the genesis](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/zhgbt/get_disciplined_not_motivated/c64qjrv).

&gt;&gt;And two plugs [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/zjv8c/check_out_rgetdisciplined_lets_make_sure_that/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/zi2h1/want_discipline_come_and_find_it/)

&gt;&gt;There were about 2000 subscriptions in the first three days

&gt;&gt;**FelEdorath**Well

&gt;&gt;After that, put posts up about it in subreddits like /r/newreddits, and dropped links to it in relevant threads over Reddit....well most of them were in relevant threads!

&gt;&gt;But yeah

&gt;&gt;**arthurf**I saw the [genesis](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/zhgbt/get_disciplined_not_motivated/c64qjrv), let's post some content to encourage others to participate and know it's a serious subreddit. So I googled some content and made 6 posts that day. And then more people started to post and participate. :)

&gt;##2.  What is /r/getdisciplined?

&gt;&gt;**TheCourageWolf**GD is a place for users who have gained discipline in their lives and also for those seeking discipline. The reason for seeking discipline is because it is recognized that only consistent action will carry people to their goals. Consistent action is achieved by (1) having a plan and (2) sticking to the plan (being disciplined with respect to the plan)

&gt;&gt;**FelEdorath**Personally I think /r/getdisciplined is a community of people that all share the same belief that it often takes alot of hard work &amp; discipline to achieve the things/goals that you want to do in your life. We all (everyone in the world) lack discipline in certain areas of our life

&gt;&gt;**arthurf** /r/getdisciplined is a community to share ideas of how to get disciplined and achieve your goals.

&gt;##3. What are your vices?

&gt;&gt;**TheCourageWolf**Reddit and also fooling around when I should be working!

&gt;&gt;**FelEdorath**I have a really really bad procrastination problem. I have been struggling with it for a long time

&gt;&gt;**arthurf**I work and do some volunteering programming on the internet, and tracking the progress of all my tasks, and it has helped me get things done. :)

&gt;##4. How do you keep the community active?

&gt;&gt;**TheCourageWolf**I'm trying to start up a weekly thread going so that 'regulars' will keep coming back.

&gt;##5. What are things you guys and/or gals need to get disciplined about?

&gt;&gt;**TheCourageWolf**Me personally I have lots of different personal development goals that I want to have plans and be disciplined about sticking to them. Not limited to but including work productivity, increasing my physical strength, wasting less time. The list goes on. But basically any way I can improve myself I want to do it. Wanting to do it is not enough, one has to have a plan and then stick to that plan.

&gt;##6. Any plans for the future of this sub?

&gt;&gt;**TheCourageWolf**Fututre plans hmmm.... I would like to see increased collaboration

&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;**TheCourageWolf**Yeah I'd like to suggest that anyone who wants a better life should frequent /r/GetDisciplined.

Miss Piggy is my role model.  When I was a little girl, independent woman who doesn't need a man to save her, but she wants him anyway.  I mean, did you see *The Great Muppet Caper*?  She bent those prison bars like they were made of clay.  Sure, she's a diva, but divas are fun; if they weren't, how to you explain the entire E! Network schedule?

Muppets aren't just for little kids.  They've been around for so long that every generation after the Baby Boomers grew up with them.  Kids and adults alike were introduced to them via /r/sesamestreet, or any of the various movies.  They're also the inspiration for an entire generation or two or three of puppeteers.  The Muppets were the inspiration for *Avenue Q*, so you can even thank them for the Internet's theme song, *The Internet is for Porn*.

/r/muppets is a subreddit for all the Muppets.  Movie and Sesame Street Muppets alike are discussed here

I had a lot of questions for the /r/muppets mod **soundbyter**

&gt;#1. What was the inspiration behind the creation of /r/muppets?  What kind of community do you want to see from the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**soundbyter** The Muppets practically commanded a community.  I wanted to share my love for every one of Jim Henson’s creations.

&gt;#2. Who is your favorite Muppet?

&gt;&gt;**soundbyter** My favorite Muppet is Basil the Bear.  He helped teach me that there was a unique set of Muppets to aid in every environment.  Je parle en peu.

&gt;#3. How were you first introduced to the Muppets?

&gt;&gt;**soundbyter** I was first introduced to the Muppets when I was a child.  I hardly realized that I was learning things through letter “sponsorships” while being so entertained.

&gt;#4. Who is the most underrated Muppet?

&gt;&gt;**soundbyter** Sam the Eagle.  He seems so tired with the idea of promoting good family values that he’s practically depressed by it.  Nobody plays straighter than poor Sam.

&gt;#5. Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?

&gt;&gt;**soundbyter** What

Thank you **soundbyter** for participating in this super important interview.  I wish all of you a good day.  I’m on my way to [Sesame Street](http://i.imgur.com/pi3zy.jpg).

“Yer a wizard, you have to admit that it’s a big part of pop culture. No, it won’t be as legendary in the future as Star Wars is now, but the magic will find a way to live on.

As an active member of [r/HarryPotter](http://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotter) (partaking in discussions, I can tell you first hand, there is no better place to discuss or be involved in the Harry Potter series. 

Just like the series, common rooms, and a Headmaster. Two mods (and heads of houses) were kind enough to answer some questions I had for r/HarryPotter. To the right we have [AccioInternets](http://www.reddit.com/user/acciointernets) (Head of Slytherin) and to my left we have [potterarchy](http://www.reddit.com/user/potterarchy) (Head of Hufflepuff).

&gt; What more can one find at r/harrypotter other than discussions about the books and movies?

&gt;&gt; *AccioInternets:* Semi-interactive-online-role-playing

&gt; Since the movies are over

&gt;&gt; *AccioInternets:* The movies may be over

&gt; What makes you guys different from any other Harry Potter blog or forum out there?

&gt;&gt; *potterarchy:* I think we're totally different from other Harry Potter sites in that all of our content is user-driven. Sites like The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet are fantastic

&gt; Assuming you've all read the books


&gt;&gt; *potterarchy:* The film adaptations were amazing in their own right, and I think this was clear by the last couple of films. There just wasn't a maintaining of continuity; each director went his own way and focused on certain elements that made that film's plot work, but in the context of the series, things like subplots, characters, and objects came seemingly from nowhere, or were dropped without explanation. Perhaps if Jo hadn't guarded her secrets so closely

&gt;&gt; *AccioInternets:* My biggest pet peeve from the movies was that Harry's eyes weren't green. Yes

&gt;&gt;Other than that

&gt; Any last minute comments?


&gt;&gt; *AccioInternets:* I'd like to say that once you choose your house and enter that specific common room - it's like a little tightly knit family of sorts. Posts do not have to be specific to Harry Potter at all - they can be about how your day went to ranting about people that really piss you off. It's nice to bounce off of like-minded individuals.
Also - Slytherin is not synonymous with evil. Prepare to be crucio'd if saying otherwise. Or you know

*Disclaimer: All the things i say are my own opinions. I am not asking anyone to follow my beliefs. They are all my own.*


REVENGE IS A DISH SERVED BEST COLD. 

The world is **not** a perfect place. Life is unfair and pushes us over in every step. One of the ways this is displayed in your life is by the people who treat you badly... This may include bullying, Damaging your property, Stealing and so many  other ways. It can be painful. really painful. I have had it many times too. The world is full of sad stories happening to so many unlucky people... 

Mahatma Gandhi taught that non violence is best defense. *I believe otherwise.* Without standing up and fighting back nothing can be achieved. I agree non-violence means standing up but *how long can we keep on showing our face to be stamped on ? how many times can you allow your heart to be destroyed ?* This world is a cruel place. Today's friends can become tomorrow's enemies. In this world where everyone wears a mask

This subreddit is full of stories of revenge taken in the best or the *professional* way if you please :D. I would suggest you guys to not mess with these subscribers :)


Here's an awesome interview with moderators.

&gt;##1. what motivates you to moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** We're motivated by the great stories. We've all been wronged in some sort of way and it's a great feeling to see someone get justice for a situation a lot of us have been in.  
**DIAMOND_OR_NOT_DIAMO:** The answer is simple
**TheSimpleArtist:** The thrill of seeing justice be done.  
**Musicmantobes:** I love being a part of the community and moderating. Seeing everyone deliver such appropriate revenge to people who deserve to get what's coming is a bit satisfying. I like helping out where I can and providing input. It's an awesome sub.



&gt;##2. which is your best revenge story ?
&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** Nothing personal comes to mind but my favorite stories from here are:
http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1enc46/scumbag_college/   http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1e7w32/i_gave_a_rapist_what_he_deserved/  
and  
http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fazy8/i_was_victim_of_a_hitandrun_i_received_threats/.  
**DIAMOND_OR_NOT_DIAMO:** I have to think about that.......  
**TheSimpleArtist:** I'd best not say. Though, and a whole lot of cake mix.  
**Musicmantobes:** Well it could be because I was young and my friend thought it was the coolest thing at the time, I saw my friend get thrown to the ground. I ran over and the bully started to go away on his bike. I made sure my friend was ok and threw the football all the way to him, hitting the front wheel of his bike and causing him to fall face first.





&gt;##3. what do you think about the whole concept of revenge ? it is said that revenge is never the answer .. so i would like know your thoughts.
&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** I think revenge is a good teacher. There are times when talking something out will have the best outcome but there are also times when getting back at the person who wronged you is the best option and will teach them a lesson but will also make you feel a lot better about the situation because you got your justice
That said
**DIAMOND_OR_NOT_DIAMO:** It depends on the situation I guess. Sometime it depends on how far a certain person is pushed, then it should be appropriate.  
**TheSimpleArtist:** Probably true. But that doesn't make reading about someone cash in on their bad karma any less sweet.  
**Musicmantobes:** While I did in my previous story, revenge can be appropriate. As long as you don't overkill or do anything crazy or illegal, it is understandable.



&gt;##4. what makes your sub unique to the other subs ?
&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** Our sub is unique because there is no other sub dedicated to getting ""pro"" revenge the way we are in a way that we can hear the story first hand from the person who got their revenge. There are subs dedicated to justice but they are for stories more in the mainstream media where you can't talk to the person who got the revenge. There are also subs for people who got more mild revenge and while it's nice
**DIAMOND_OR_NOT_DIAMO:** What makes our sub unique is the complexity and work it takes for some revenge to be accomplished. There are subreddit's like /r/pettyrevenge
**TheSimpleArtist:** That's something we've been talking about a lot as a mod team, but the best, harshest, and most earned stories are posted here. Thus, the ""Pro"" in ProRevenge.  
**Musicmantobes:** Our subreddit offers a satisfying relief and sense of fulfillment inside every story of juicy revenge. The knowledge of justice being served is a good feeling. Showing this through a story of pro-revenge and viewing someone else's revenge is oddly satisfying.


&gt;##5. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8:** We love our readers and subscribers and we're so appreciative of the content they've brought us. We have been greatly entertained by the stories posted on /r/ProRevenge and by the creativity as well. We look forward to seeing even more awesome revenge stories in the future and sharing good
**DIAMOND_OR_NOT_DIAMO:** Be sure to read through some of the posts
**TheSimpleArtist:** To our present subscribers: If I have ever done anything to offend you, and leave me out of your next scheme.  
**Musicmantobes:** I'd just like to thank them for submitting their stories and continuing to do so. I feel like we have built quite a nice community and I love the support people give in the comments section. Just keep being awesome and enjoy the sub! Thanks

**192** artists for **1 year**

 You know by my name that I love small subs. Those out of the way places that give Reddit its' flavor.  This morsel comes from the art world, I know that you artists are out there. And what artist doesn't want to up their game, find a new tip, trick, technique or tool. So here is your central repository. The place to post and read about improving your artistic skillset.

 I'm not much of an artist. That is to say that no one who has ever seen my work calls it art. But that doesn't stop me from trying. Mostly I work in [collage and montage](http://i.imgur.com/pBoOaKw.jpg?1). I find the work itself relaxing, which I do. I call it a win as long as I walk away thinking differently about what I do. Or just thinking more about art really.



&gt;## 1. How did this sub get started? What inspired you to put it together?

&gt;&gt; **/u/DeSaad** : I love to read/watch tutorials, I had to cancel the subscriptions and was forced to look for more stuff on the internet. Over the years I found quite a few helpful sites, and decided to share them with other people.

&gt;## 2. Are you an artist? What medium do you work in? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/DeSaad** : Yep! I do comics and illustrations and animation

&gt;## 3.What is the scope of /r/ArtTutorials? What mediums does it cover? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/DeSaad** : I just wanted to share what I found with other artists. Also to treat the subreddit as a sort of Cloud... backup... thing... for the next time I have to randomly format my computer and lose all my bookmarked pages yet again.

&gt;## 4. Have there been any tutorials that really changed the way you work or look at art making? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/DeSaad** : Most of these have really impacted my processes.

&gt;## 5. What are your hopes for this little sub? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/DeSaad** : I just hope more people start contributing more stuff. It would be cool if it became a free resource pool for people who can't afford to subscribe to sites or magazines to actually learn new things.

&gt;## 6. Anything else you would like to add for subscribers or other tutorial fans? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/DeSaad** : Treat this as your own personal archive. Post stuff you'd like your younger self to discover. Tips, methods, pictures, videos, it's all good, as long as it's free. Anything you deem unnecessary does not have to be posted. However whatever you'd bookmark on your preferred web browser has a place here.


So there you have it /r/ArtTutorials. A small sub dedicated to sharing and learning. I hope it inspires you to pick-up a new technique and try it out. Even if it's only an /r/doodles.

**723 inane storytellers** for **2 months**

I went on a journey to find out what /r/worststory was all about

I woke up the next morning

Apparently, the manager came out, she was a smoking hot 86 year old woman, her weighing 260 lbs wasn't even noticeable. We ended up banging on top of the salad bar. To really spice things up we invited a whole bunch of homeless veterans to have an orgy in the bathroom at Applebee's.

Well, the Vietnam vet with no legs. Next thing we know Tom is hanging around the neck of the Arby's mascot and screaming ""Burn the witch."" Seven dwarves join in on the ""burn the witch"" chant. 

It ends up that Applebee's is super religious and we were rewarded with gold medals. Tom then went on to become a world class toll booth operator.

From what I've gathered about /r/worststory is that it is all about community

The worst interview I've ever done with Warisin

&gt;##1) What would you like to say to potential new subscribers before they enter the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Warisin:** Don’t be afraid to write due to lack of writing experience, WorstStory is for writers and readers!

&gt;&gt;**HDPants:** You look good today. Good enough to eat. Or to write horribly disgusting stories.

&gt;&gt;**unicycle_inc:** They don't think /r/worststory be like it is

&gt;##2) What was your inspiration for creating or becoming a moderator for /r/WorstStory?

&gt;&gt;**Warisin:** I really have no idea.

&gt;&gt;**HDPants:** When I stumbled on the subreddit, ""YAH OK HDPANTS BUT ONLY CUZ UR PANTS ARE HD."" It was a good moment.

&gt;&gt;**unicycle_inc:** /r/worststory is the only subreddit that I followed religiously and I sensed that it was going to be bigger than Jesus so naturally I applied to be a mod and after several dinner dates with Warisin he agreed on the condition that I only wear an apron whenever I mod.

&gt;##3) Favorite (worst) story you have read so far?

&gt;&gt;**Warisin:** [Rod Bucks for sure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/196yo7/critiquepulp_fictionsleaze_fiction_rod_bucks_1100/)

&gt;&gt;**HDPants:** I really liked the stories about being a sentient tampon and the man who fell in love with a pasta strainer. Tear jerkers.

&gt;&gt;**unicycle_inc:** My favourite (thought long and hard on this) (hehe) has got to be the court room scene featuring James Gravy and Dr. Fred Horkaboo

&gt;##4) Favorite part about moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Warisin:** I love the community

&gt;&gt;**HDPants:** The best part is it's so EASY. I do NOTHING. EVER. Well, of course, is because our readers and those who contribute to the cause (building the absolute worst stories they can) are so brilliant and lovely. bravo, buttwads. Im prouda u

&gt;&gt;**unicycle_inc:** I have to agree with Pants here

&gt;##5) Would you like to make any closing remarks?

&gt;&gt;**Warisin:** I’d just like to say to those coming in

&gt;&gt;**HDPants:** I urge everyone that wants to write to take a looksie at this right here. Some tips from the PROS we're not really pros . I'd like to thank God for giving me this opportunity to say some things about this subreddit because reasons

So why not enjoy this.

Here at /r/GamePhysics they see the fun in those glitches

**But wait

They do not only share gifs or videos of funny glitches, your call.

And now an interesting interview with /u/doctorsnazzbaggle and /u/Dickfore. 
Ready? Set... Go! 










&gt;#1.People think glitches in games are annoying and that they represent a low quality game. How can you prove them wrong?
&gt;&gt;   **doctorsnazzbaggle**    I can't really prove them wrong as that's their opinion but glitches can help a developer improve there game in some cases and I always find them hilarious.
&gt;&gt;    **Dickfore**    Glitches in games can most certainly be annoying, something that just can't be processed correctly, and that's to be expected when you have millions of lines of programming running every second. Part of GamePhysics is finding the humor in these errors; sometimes when games screw up, it's hilarious ... in retrospect :)

&gt;#2.How did you all get involved with this subreddit? 
&gt;&gt;   **doctorsnazzbaggle**    I saw one of Dickfore's submissions on /r/gaming and volunteered to help.
&gt;&gt;    **Dickfore**    I saw a gif on /r/gaming and commented asking if there was a subreddit dedicated to weird game physics. Nobody replied, which resulted in a few thousand subscriptions in very little time. It felt like Christmas!

&gt;#3.What is a common glitch on this subreddit? 
&gt;&gt;   **doctorsnazzbaggle**    Do you mean a glitch with the subreddit itself or the most submitted glitch? I can't think of any glitches within the subreddit but the most frequently submitted glitches are usually from Just Cause 2

&gt;#4.What is the funniest or weirdest glitch you have seen? 
&gt;&gt;   **doctorsnazzbaggle**    The Corrupted Blood Incident (google it) in World Of Warcraft was funny, people fled to more isolated areas, journalists compared it to a real world epidemic and chat and the forum were a mess of people shouting and flaming.
&gt;&gt;    **Dickfore**    Funniest glitch would probably be GTA IV's Carmaggedon. There's just something hilarious about getting a car to the face out of nowhere.

&gt;#5.What game has the best physics in your opinion? 
&gt;&gt;   **doctorsnazzbaggle**    This is definitely not backed up by fact but I'll never forget my first playthrough of Half-Life 2 and just being amazed at the physics engine.
&gt;&gt;    **Dickfore**    Ya know, especially objects' interaction with water. You could break apart pallets, and you'd be able to see every little piece of cracked wood bob up and down on the surface. I think it was one of the first games I played with ragdoll physics too, which was certainly fun to play with. I've never played Assassin's Creed, but when I watched my friends play, I was blown away with the climbing physics. The avatar never grabbed at air ... every hand was precisely placed on a brick, rung, or what have you.

&gt;#6.Tell us something about the community!  
&gt;&gt;   **doctorsnazzbaggle**    The community is awesome and we are discussing ways to make this subreddit even better
&gt;&gt;    **Dickfore**    While the subreddit right now is mostly glitchy game stuff, but it'd be nice to see a game that makes you sit back and say, ""Hold on, Newton's laws are freaking amazing.""



&gt;#7.Would you like to add anything? 
&gt;&gt;   **doctorsnazzbaggle**    I'd like to thank all our subscribers and my fellow moderators for making this subreddit such an awesome place and I'd like to thank /r/SubredditOfTheDay for featuring us.
&gt;&gt;    **Dickfore**    Thanks for the feature!

Without interviews

If you do

Six word stories; interesting concept

A subreddit filled with stories like:

Fell in love once

Wedding dress: worn once

An unrecognizable shadow through my window.

I aplogize; that was my best. Many do better in this subreddit. Some stories make you think hard. They make you wonder the context. Just six words is very little. To write a story

Writing isn't for all of us. Some enjoy it very much though. If you do

I bought some colored pants today. One in orange; one in blue. I felt really cool in them. I did [this](http://img803.imageshack.us/img803/8919/resize.gif) with them on. I got looks from women nearby. I think they were just jealous. Few people have moves like that.

Well low and behold, or bags!  Happy one year anniversary!  To celebrate, we're giving ourselves the best gift of all - the opportunity to redo some of the greatest subreddits we've featured over the past year.   It's retro week at Subreddit of the Day!

It gives me sincere pleasure to salute today's featured subreddit since  /r/shutupandtakemymoney was one of the greatest stories reddit has ever told!  In it's first week as a subreddit, such huge energy around this place!

And did they suck? Did they let fame go to their heads?  Au contraire mon frere!  The mod team kept things great.  One year later they are still pumping out the same great content that got us hooked in the first place.  Each and every post is a testament to the creativity of mankind.

Here to help us kick off Retro Week (a concept we hope you'll enjoy)

&gt;Such a great subreddit! How's the year been? Can you summarize the past 12 months for us?

&gt;&gt;stinkylibrary:  Wow,000 subscribers to now over 80,000. It's been a bit hectic at times, and with our growth we've seen an increase in people attempting to game the sub. Considering that we are pretty much the anti-thesis of other subs (i.e. we basically allow only spam) it's been... interesting.

&gt;&gt;Addyct:  I've only been a mod for a few months, and it feels like we've seen most of it pass through over the year.

&gt;I see this place as a treasure box - every post is something impossibly cool

&gt;&gt;Addyct:  I see it as Reddit's collective Wish list. As something created by the community, I'd rather you take it somewhere else.

&gt;&gt;stinkylibrary:  I see it as the subreddit where products that were found other places on Reddit can get some attention. Sometimes the posts come from comments

&gt;Some say that as subreddits grow

&gt;&gt;sl:  Definitely the attempts to game the subreddit

&gt;&gt;Ad:  Yeah, but the comments are filled with people explaining exactly why it's a POS. For instance, a week or so ago, someone made a post saying ""I'm sick of hipster garbage. Here's a Grappling hook"". Because it had a good title and because it was a freakin' grappling hook, it quickly shot to the top. The problem was that the comments were filled with people explaining how it was a really, really terrible product and not actually safe to use. Even though it technically followed all our rules, I deleted that post. The last thing I want to happen is some kid to buy a 30 dollar grappling hook because they saw it on our subreddit and end up killing themselves when they try to use it because it broke.

&gt;What's the future looking like? What can we all expect in the 2nd year?!

&gt;&gt;sl:  Well

&gt;&gt;Ad:  Officially licensed /r/shutupandtakemymoney merchandise!

&gt;&gt;...Nah

&gt;Take it. Take the mic and send a message to your subscribers

&gt;&gt;Ad:  Really? Oh god, and it would be incredibly hard to maintain without your help. I've constantly amazed by the people who show up to lend their insight and expertise about the things that are posted.

Tonight at 9/8 CST season six, where even in the off season the sub may slow down but never really dies. It's hard to talk about a TV sub, without talking about the show, and it's really hard to write about one of the most [written about](http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=49988), well written shows on TV. I am pretty much Don right now, the night before the Lucky Strike meeting. 


I was a weird kid. As one of the youngest kids in a large Irish Catholic family, more everything interesting about my family that happened there, that happened in that time, before I was born. 


I could never know what that family was like, the only house I ever knew... It was as if all the best things had been done or said before I was born, in a place I could never go.

But show creator Matthew Weiner and his crew have, her camel hair coat in season four, the maternity dress she wore to Roger's Derby Day party.

It doesn't hurt that Don looks like my my dad in his suits and five o'clock shadow and acts just like him, like Sally, I was a daddy's girl. 

It seems like all my life, iconic. And no decade more so the sixties. The sixties of my family's heyday, and the sixties of Mad Men. 

/r/MadMen offers a diverse variety of offerings, fan theories and discussions. [Even AMAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/vxaoc/rich_sommer_be_answering_questions_starting_at_11/) But it's also like a film theory or lit class, or even history. But more fun. [And if you haven't yet watched the series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsJSRP7cZVo) the AV Club put together a list of [Ten Episodes that show the many facets of Mad Med](http://www.avclub.com/articles/10-episodes-that-show-the-best-of-mad-mens-many-fa,95458/) to help you get a jump on the season.

Come on over to /r/MadMen. *It's Toasted.*






&gt;##1. What is Mad Men for those who may not know?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** Mad Men is an AMC hit drama centered around the life of Don Draper, but the people around him aren't just bit players.

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard** The greatest drama show on tv

&gt;##2. How many times have you watched the series?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** You'd probably be surprised

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard** 4 now

&gt;##3. Betty: hate or great?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** Both. First, there seem to be two schools of thought on Betty. The one school is that she is a shrill psychopath. The other school is that Betty is a product of her times, that she is what society made women into in the 60s. I agree with the premise that we are all products of society, but I can't cut her that much slack because of that. Other women on the show have been shown to be victims of societal pressures without being as cold and malicious as Betty is. Ultimately, I think she's a deeply messed up person. I do sometimes feel bad for her, but there comes a point in your life where you have to own up to your actions.

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard** Betty... loved at first

&gt;##4. How did you get into the series?
&gt;&gt; **Snookums** I saw the ads on AMC and watched the original pilot when it first came out. I've been hooked ever since.

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard** I got into the series when I read about it online

&gt;##5. Favorite post(s)?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** I can't point to a specific one

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard** Not sure honestly

&gt;##6. Favorite character(s)?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** Ida Blankenship. Yeah

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard** 
Favorite character is a tie between sterling and draper

&gt;##7. Favorite scene(s) or storylines?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** Favorite scenes. The scene where Sal gets fired. Probably one of the saddest scenes on the show.
&gt;&gt;Also
&gt;&gt;Favorite storyline. Peggy and Pete's relationship in the first two seasons. I loved the weirdness of the attraction between the two.

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard**Favorite scene is probably the carousel pitch

&gt;##8. Anything you'd like to say to present or future subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** If you haven't watched the show yet, please don't post spoilers and be respectful of the actors and actresses. We all get that Christina Hendricks is hot, but she's also a fabulous actress, and she deserves more praise for that.

&gt;&gt; **jeanlucdickhard** 
I want all of our subscribers to enjoy this subreddit and help us continue enriching the mad men experience with our little community

&gt;##9. Anything you'd like to add that I may have missed?

&gt;&gt; **Snookums** I'd like to add we're very welcoming of strangers. Don't feel that you have to know everything about the show to participate.

Mmm, F7U12_HAM is, eh, an interesting subreddit. It got recommended to me the other day by my ~~good friend~~ mistress, /u/Paradox. We needed to fill today, and now it's being filled. By ham. Tasty ham.

F7U12_HAM is a place where the worst of F7U12 resides. The stuff so bad it couldn't even make it there (no offense). The quality of these comics is so horrible

I sat down (did not actually sit down*) with Paradox and gave him a couple questions in realtime. Because

&gt;#1. Why ham?

&gt;&gt;**Paradox** Because ham is what reddit

&gt;#2. Do you have a favorite comic of all time?

&gt;&gt;**Paradox**  Yeah

&gt;#3. What drove you to create F7U12_HAM?

&gt;&gt;**Paradox** We (the moderators of f7u12) got tired of people whining about the mods not doing anything. So we decided to create a subreddit that showed all the comics that we removed. I wrote the bot in a few hours

&gt;#4. Do the original creators ever come along? What's that like?

&gt;&gt;**Paradox** All the time. It's tremendously amusing. We always get comments like ""FUCK YOU REPOSTING WHORE"". If you just browse http://www.reddit.com/r/f7u12_ham/comments you can see several.

&gt;#5. Thanks for your time

&gt;&gt;**Paradox** Might want to mention that the bot is coded in ruby

There we have it, enjoy the ham.

The Golden Retriever has its roots in Scotland and is a medium-sized breed of dog. They were historically developed as gundogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties. Because of their loyal and gentle temperament, including guide dog for the blind, hearing dog for the deaf, hunting dog, illegal-drug detector, and search and rescue participant.

I own a golden retriever myself, while looking at something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Tqenf.jpg). 
Golden retrievers make your day much better

So I sat down with the moderators of /r/goldenretriever

&gt;##1. Can you list some of the pro's and cons of a golden retriever? 
&gt;&gt;    **orangeblood**    The pro's are almost too many to name. I guess I'd just say that Golden Retrievers are extremely happy and eager to please. They are very friendly to other animals and small children. They can be trained easily and are very obedient. As for cons... They are big, with Golden Retrievers being no exception.

&gt;&gt;    **Drizaya**    Oy! Everything Orange said as far as pros:) as for cons, would eat rocks, garden hoses, sod, plants, and socks:/ they also can have serious separation anxiety. They become very attached to their humans, and can cause some serious destruction if not properly trained. As for the the fur business, and it's been amazing! Reduces shedding by at least 90%

If it's there's one thing that Reddit has plenty of subreddits for, to the inevitable /r/truemusic, and then beyond, into a myriad of subs for every genre and flavor that stretches from the irreverent /r/punk to the brainy /r/classicalmusic. If it is a genre and even sometimes when it's not (/r/purplemusic, anyone?), then there's bound to be a music sub devoted to it.

But what if you're not yet sure what you like, too! 

/r/ListenToUs (not to be confused with its more mainstream cousin,"" so as you can imagine, they're a pretty tough crowd to please. Thanks I'm sure to their discerning tastes, it's highly unlikely that you'll ever see a mainstream or overplayed song appear in this sub (much to the delight of those who hate r/music's constant stream of Pink Floyd and Gorrillaz).
 
Instead, and 
other randoms picks by the sub's monthly crop of submitters. Picks range from any and all genres, electronic, or psychedelic flavors. 

As if all this wasn't cool enough, has lovingly coded [an online radio to play the sub's featured tracks](http://radd.it/listentous/)! It's still a bit rough around the edges (some songs wouldn't play for me), but for only a beta, I'd say it's pretty damned impressive. I mean, you can upvote/downvote the submitters' posts from the radio itself, see a biography on each song's band, view each album's cover art

&gt;1.What inspired you to create r/listentous?

&gt;&gt;**listentous**  A love of music and and no clue about new artists or music outside of the genres I know. I have the best taste in music ever

&gt;2.Explain how these music elections work.

&gt;&gt;**listentous** Once a month we make an election post. We announce the theme for that election and everyone who wants to enter comments in that post with 3 songs (one popular

&gt;&gt;There's a few rules for submitters

&gt;3.If I had a deep and abiding love for DeadMau5 or however the fuck you spell it

&gt;&gt;**listentous** Our official rule is ""no corporate bullshit music"" but I've begun to prefer thinking of it as ""music that will outlive its creator"". I'm know some have entered elections with DeadMau5 as one of their tracks

&gt;4.Tell me more about your new music player!

&gt;&gt;**listentous**  *Oh man*

&gt;&gt;* Plays the best music ever. That's pretty neat.
&gt;&gt;* Playlists customizable by genre
&gt;&gt;* Lets you upvote/ downvote/ read the reddit comments
&gt;&gt;* Displays blurbs about the artists background
&gt;&gt;* Shows ya artist and album images
&gt;&gt;* Keeps track of *all* the songs
&gt;&gt;* Hosted on our swanky domain of *radd.it*

&gt;&gt;It's less than a month old and slowly creeping up to a Beta status. There's more to be done

&gt;5.What would you say really sets /r/listentous apart from r/listentothis?

&gt;&gt;**listentous** The *us*.

&gt;&gt;Also

&gt;6.What are a few of your all-time favorite songs in your sub

&gt;&gt;**listentous** I feel obligated to answer this question with [our top-scoring links](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all). You'll notice the genres are all over the place; the top 10 tracks are electronica-indie, post-punk, and blues.

&gt;&gt;For me personally

&gt;&gt;* The Units - ""[High Pressure Days](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/comments/10oc5u/the_units_high_pressure_days_synthpunk_1979/ ""but we didn't say hello to each other"")"" Devo-esque post-punk from 1979.

&gt;&gt;* The Coup - ""[Magic Clap](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/comments/10kij1/the_coup_the_magic_clap_hiphop_2012/ ""to homeland security/ we are the bomb"")"" Brooklyn hip-hop from 2012. 'cause I'm a sucka for a good groove.

&gt;&gt;* Raymond Scott - ""[Cindy Electronium] (http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/comments/10iukb/raymond_scott_cindy_electronium_electronic_1959/)"" Electronica from NINETEEN FIFTY-NINE. This guy might have been a time-traveller.

&gt;7.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**listentous**  Nothing I don't say to them often already-- thanks to making r/listentous the best damn music subreddit. We wouldn't be what we are without those who participate in our elections

Youtube. Possibly my favorite place on the internet. Besides 9gag and Pintrest

But I'm not here to talk about videos. I'm hear to talk about the comments under the video. I don't know how people can post such golden comments sometimes


So, it's the best season yet. I think I might now what my feature will be next week.

So anyway

1.  Sandwiches are awesome. Seriously

2.  I am so glad summer is almost over. I can literally feel my skin burning every time I walked outside.

3.  I don't have a number 3.






&gt;##1. I see that /r/youtubecomments started 2 years ago by [deleted]. How did this subreddit fall into your hands?

&gt;&gt; **smokinjoints** david12scht took over the sub about 5 months ago when it had less than 100 members. I saw his post in redditrequest and liked the idea so I offered to help with CSS and moderating/promoting the subreddit. Since then it's grown to almost 3000 members with a fairly active community.

&gt;&gt; **david12scht** The idea just one day popped into my head

&gt;##2. Do you comment on youtube videos or do you just browse?

&gt;&gt; **smokinjoints** I don't comment on youtube videos very often. I usually check the top comments though

&gt;&gt; **david12scht** I do comment, which is a natural product of having one of the largest (possibly the largest, I was thinking the other day) open forums in the world.

&gt;##3. What is your favorite comment?

&gt;&gt; **smokinjoints** I got a good laugh out of [this one](http://i.imgur.com/9Y9ir.png) when I first saw it.

&gt;&gt; **david12scht** I just saw [this one](http://i.imgur.com/dGREO.png) on the front page. I was pleasantly surprised: the submitter actually took the effort to not just screenshot the comment


&gt;##4. [The next question is in the form of a video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SoWNMNKNeM)

&gt;&gt; **smokinjoints** I do the CSS for the sub and then just the usual mod stuff like checking the spam queue

&gt;##5. Any last things you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; **smokinjoints** Snails can sleep for up to 3 years.

Hmm...I seem to have a spot of writers block. Instead of writing this paragraph about something relevant to /r/lifehacks

So, I'm going to narrate my brothers engagement party in an artsy-wanna-be-tumblr way.

I was getting ready slowly but carefully. Picking out the ~~write~~ right jewelry, I went to the hall where the party was going to be. I saw my brother and his future wife holding hands and laughing. And then it hit me. My brother's getting married. To this beautiful elegant girl. I saw the way she held herself and secretly envied her for having so much poise. People started to show up. They came up to congratulate them, and took their seats at the round tables with the flower center pieces. They were lost in their own little world. Not caring about anything that was going on around them. Just staring into each others eyes and smiling. How I yearn for that.

So my real thoughts on it were: Gotta take this red lipstick off, you want to get drunk now?

And that's exactly what happened. And then we went to a bar and sang some karaoke. It was awesome.


I recently realized the importance of curtains. Holy shit is morning light annoying. You see, with no curtains, I've been getting up when the sun does. Which really sucks when you've been out until 3 AM drinking with cousins that you don't see very often.

I also started watching Psych. I don't know why I didn't watch it before. It's actually very funny.

Tomorrow I'm skipping my first day of summer class to go to a waterpark. I haven't been to one in 6 or 7 years. I'm not sure what to expect kid-wise. Are there going to be a lot? And will they be annoying as hell?

One last thing

So /r/lifehacks. I only just discovered the subreddit a few weeks ago. It's pretty legit. I've used some of the tips on there

So go check it out. You might learn a thing or two. Or even better

As a reaction to this incredible post

So I'll take you through my thought process.  First, next step, *shit pants.*  Third step, browse comment section to see if this mythical creature has posted current photos of her holding up a circus tent or something.  Next, see link to /r/tall.  Fifth step, *re-shit pants!*  This place has gone on for three years providing an awesome place for the tallest of the tall?  God Damn!  I forget where I was numerically... next step, contact mods of /r/tall

/r/tall. Great place, good times.  Even if you're 5'10 like me, you can still get down with /r/tall.  Join me as I go one on one with *icefall5*, moderator, camp counselor, bean pole.

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;People always ask me if I like being tall, but there are also plenty of problems. For example, I cannot ride many (most?) roller coasters at theme parks when I go, as I either don't fit or I'm over the maximum height limit. Overall, though, I can't complain -- I do enjoy being tall.

&gt;Other than photos of really tall people

&gt;&gt;/r/tall is designed to be a ""safe"" environment for anyone tall. We always (and I mean ALWAYS) get asked questions like ""Do you play basketball?"" or ""How tall are you?"" While most of us understand that the questions are valid, and where you can get help finding clothing, shoes, cars, anything, really -- basically like support by tall folks for tall folks.

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;It's very exciting! We were the top comment on a recent front page post,000 today. It's really exciting, and it's much more than I ever expected for the community. On top of that, we're in the process of finding some new mods, and that will be great for the community.

&gt;Are you worried about your subreddit's recent growth spurt?

&gt;&gt;It is slightly worrying, however, moderation will be slightly slower. It shouldn't be too much of an issue. I think the growth spurt (heh) is much more good than bad, as a larger community will lead to more help for the subscribers and more of a community feel.

&gt;I understand there's a wee bit of a tall network on reddit. What are the other tall subreddits?

&gt;&gt;There is a little bit of a network, and also /r/TallGoneWild, which is pretty self-explanatory (and I am not a mod). /r/TallTwoX also exists, which is for tall women. It doesn't have many subscribers, and only three posts, but it is there. /r/TallMeetTall has built a pretty decent base of subscribers as well, and I believe people are happy with the way it has turned out. I will admit that I don't ever go on /r/TallGoneWild, as that's not really my thing.

&gt;You had me at /r/TallGoneWild.  The last paragraph is yours my friend.

&gt;&gt;I just want to thank everyone for the amazing support that /r/tall has seen. I said earlier that I never expected it to get this big, however, and I am not at all upset about that. I'm very proud that we've gotten to where we are now, and I'm very excited to see where we'll go in the future!

Welcome to the best secret on reddit - welcome to [/r/nocontext](/r/nocontext)!  Are you like me, son!  [/r/nocontext](/r/nocontext) is the place where you can take one sentence (or a part of a sentence) from the comment sections of other subreddits and repost it.  Since there's no context, these posts are all comedy gold!!  The best way to describe it?  If you've ever been in an elevator and wanted to shout out the punchline of an imaginary joke, sending everyone into hysterics, this is the place to find these comedy gems.

I've already said too much.  Today we have the creator

&gt;What the hell's going on here at /r/nocontext?

&gt;If /r/bestof had an insane younger brother

&gt;&gt;Stranger danger!

&gt;I understand the up/down vote system on other subreddits

&gt;&gt;I have no way of knowing ahead of time what will work and what will fail. So much depends on the mood of the readers at the moment - hungry? Drunk? Sexually frustrated? Looking for ways to wow the guys at tomorrow's job interview at google? Being non-formulaic brings humor to the chaos - random is good.

&gt;When you started /r/nocontext

&gt;&gt;When I started /r/nocontext I didn't really have any expectations. It was forged in the middle of the night one day night and I read this line: [mystery cloth on the guy's head turns out to be his underwear](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kdbe8/worst_sex_of_my_life_w_bonus_weirdness/). I lost it - laughing until I could barely breathe. At o'dark thirty that fateful morning such a random bit of weirdness coming out of nowhere I had to share. (Thank you for your inspiration The_Big_Salad)

&gt;&gt;Gone right is the that some people laugh or at least give a double take. Thanks to people like 0alexander posting ""You are the best kind of pedophile"" we sometimes get some incredible bursts of traffic. Still to be done is to get more readers and more input.

&gt;What nocontext post(s) still make you laugh to this day.

&gt;&gt;It depends on how sleep deprived I am. However

&gt;&gt; - I was sitting at the table crying

&gt;&gt; - And you would die with the universe stopped. Forever. Just because you wanted to satisfy some sexual desires.

&gt;&gt; - Look at this guy

&gt;&gt; - I had an accidental erection so powerful

&gt;&gt; - I swear if my highest voted comment is about my dad jizzing in my hair I think I'm going to cry.

291 Zone heads

&gt;For those not aware

&gt;&gt;Prior to April 26, was that it had a nuclear power plant. On the night of April 26, 1986 some tests were being run on an emergency cooling system in reactor number 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The test led to an out-of-control chain reaction resulting in a catastrophic explosion that blew the lid off of the reactor and destroyed the reactor buildings roof. The reactor burned until May 10, 1986 releasing millions of radioactive particles into the atmosphere which would inevitably spread accross all of Europe. The areas worst affected were the surrounding countries including Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Everyone within a 30km exlusion zone was forced to leave their homes forever, and the area remain uninhabitable to this day. The effects of the disaster can still be felt today in the form of birth defects, cancers and various other diseases.


&gt;What interests you so much about Chernoby? Why a subreddit based on a single event?

&gt;&gt;I was born in Moscow

&gt;&gt;Unlike bullets, we messed with nature, we had taken it too far and it was too late - we couldn't ctrl+z out of this one. The unthinkable had happened, and someone had to clean up the mess. Hundres of thousands of heroic liquidators (or bio-robots as they were called) endured lethal levels of radiation to clean up the mess. The sheer will power and later suffering exhibited by these people is astounding.

&gt;&gt;Then there was the mass evacuation of Pripyat - 50, and continue to suffer the effects. They lived in concrete and steel highrise apartment buildings, had jobs, commuted to work on the bus and played with their kids at the playground. They were thriving, modern cities.

&gt;&gt;It's safe to say that taking all of these things into consideration, and a new safe confinement is currently under construction. Various cancers and diseases continue to be on the rise in the affected areas. I actually have several friends and aquantances from Belarus, Poland and Ukraine that suffer from Chernobyl-linked ailments including hypothyroidism, low immune system function, cancers, anemia and more. So, why a subreddit based on a single event? The event is far from over,000 years or so.


&gt;Have you heard of video games based on Chernobyl? In particular

&gt;&gt;I have heard of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, but after the disaster - many people drew parallels between the two. The ""Zone"" became the exclusion zone and ""stalkers"" were workers / guides that worked inside the exclusion zone. Due to radioactive particles, you have to be careful where you go in the exlusion zone - which is very much like the movie; where you needed a guide to safely guide you through it. I highly recommend that everyone interested in the topic, watch the movie. You can watch it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYEfJhkPK7o) with English subtitles!

&gt;&gt;My understanding is that the developers did a very good job accurately modeling the levels of the game around the existing abandoned city of Pripyat. My only hope is that the game will help spark the interest of players about the Chernobyl disaster

&gt;Have you seen the recent Chernobyl Diaries movie? What did you think?

&gt;&gt;Yes, but the execution was very poor. The only reason I was interested in it and was actually able to watch the whole thing was probably because it was about Chernobyl - my not-so-secret obsession. I'll be honest, I was really hooked by the movie in the begining - up until the first person got ""attacked"".
I'm not sure if it was actually filmed in Pripyat

&gt;What can redditors expect from your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Redditors can expect a wealth of information surrounding the Chernobyl disaster and its aftermath. I regularly seek out and post Chernobyl documentaries, news and articles. I try my best to filter out the nonsense and post the most interesting and intriguing content. Redditors should treat /r/chernobyl like a magazine; go to the very first page and start there. Although the content may not be ""fresh"", it is still good quality and will be fresh to you. I'll also post regular discussions surrounding the Chernobyl disaster and love to hear the input of readers.

&gt;&gt;Some of the things that I'm working on right now (quoted from a previous post I made):

&gt;&gt;* Finding and inviting survivors
&gt;&gt;* Researching and cataloging (and perhaps organizing our own) a list of legitimate charities where to donate money to aid the victims and survivors of the Chernobyl catastrophe.
&gt;&gt;* Setting up and maintaining a wiki that will catalog categorized posts from this subreddit (eg: list of all of the documentaries

Glitches. Fuck yes. 

***STUPID UNRELATED SHIT STARTS HERE***

Before I get on to the actual feature, /r/glitch_art. To keep it short, that feature sucked. I didn’t get to featuring it because, well, the write-up sucked. Don’t try and look it up, it will make your eyes bleed, I swear.

***STUPID UNRELATED SHIT ENDS HERE***

First off, for sure, but they have a sense of life and modern art to it. I sound crazy now don’t I? “YE U DO KNAGA” Ok then, storytime with Uncle Kanga!

Surfing this subreddit made me find out about electronica music group, and I fell in love with the music. About 3 days after, I bought the CD and I will never regret it. Thank you /r/glitch_art for making me find this amazing album. I love you. &lt;3

Another story, and (tried to) glitch it, what happened you ask? Well, it saved as a .wav file when the picture was a .jpeg. I tried uploading to Imgur to see if that would fix anything, but it came out as, literally, nothing. Three megabytes of data was on that file, and I probably never will know. I guess being a noob at Audacity can make you do the impossible.

There really isn’t much to say about this subreddit, instead of making a new interview with the mods at /r/glitch_art, I’m just going to copy the one I did with that crappy first feature I made, since it was pretty decent (and the only thing in that feature that didn’t make you wish you were dead). HERE YOU GOOOOOOO!

&gt;##1. Why did you create /r/glitch_art?
&gt;&gt; **_ap_2** I created /r/glitch_art because I was curious to see what others were doing with the art form.

&gt;##2. Are you surprised at the amount of subscribers you have now?
&gt;&gt; **_ap_2** No, in a place where everyone can use them and discuss them.

&gt;##3. What’s your favourite glitch art on this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **_ap_2** I really like the video datamoshes and the paintings inspired by corrupted image files.

&gt;##4. What made you interested in databending?
&gt;&gt; **_ap_2** It stems from my interest in early 80's industrial music and what those groups and personalities were doing with photo

&gt;##5. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **_ap_2** We need more mods. Preferably mods who understand CSS because I don't. I recently joined the military and I leave for Basic Training in a few months. I'm not sure what's going to happen to me after Basic but I'm assuming that I won't have regular access to the internet. So if anyone out there is interested in moderating /r/glitch_art then message me.

You remember that feature I did about a month ago? My first one? It’s not a trick question, that’s just been topped.

Ok, it hurts my eyes. Holy mother of God. If you thought finding the submit/upvote/subscribe button in /r/Ooer was hard, go to /r/hurts_my_eyes. You can’t find jackshit, I mean... WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!?! This subreddit frustrated me when I first came to this subreddit (thanks /r/crappydesign) but after I took a drink to calm me down, I was like “You know what, let’s make this a subreddit of the day!” So I did, hopefully you guys won’t go all apeshit on me

Now we get onto /r/hurts_my_eyes's somewhat calmer (but still awful) cousin, and I regret every second I spent on that subreddit. To be fair, this subreddit SOOOO much easier to navigate than that /r/hurts_my_eyes bullshit. GOD FUCKING DAMN I HATE THAT SUBREDDIT SO MUCH. *ahem* Sorry, had a fit of rage there. No worries, medicine can help! (hopefully) So yeah, /r/infiniteworldproblems has a text colour that kinda blends in with the background, but at least it’s not fucking /r/hurts_my_eyes WHERE IT’S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE!!!! Sorry

I seriously don’t know why I bother with these subreddits, brain?! I’M SO MAD AT THESE SUBREDDITS I COULD FUCKING FIND THE MODERATORS HOUSE AND SMASH HIS HEAD IN! Umm... sorry about that... little too angry, still. MEDICINE TIME! 

Well, I’ll get sent to prison, and my parents would be disgraced, so how about we take a lighter side on all of this and have an interview with the moderators of /r/hurts_my_eyes and /r/infiniteworldproblems before I pass out of a medicine overdose?

We’ve all heard the myths.  Ninjas can walk on water.  If you drop a penny from the Empire State building

Or is there?

Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, or don’t have either Discovery Channel or Netflix, these two fine gentlemen with a background in special effects work for movies go to work proving or disproving myths.  They’re assisted by human assistants Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara; and by a humanoid assistant Buster.  They put all the crazy myths we’ve heard to the test, and if they can manage to fit in an explosion, they will.

/r/mythbusters is a community that discusses *Mythbusters* and the myths on the show.  Sure, and it’s a thing of beauty.

I decided to have a sit-down with the /r/mythbusters mods to bust some myths

&gt;#1. What drew you to Mythbusters?

&gt;&gt;**demograph** I was drawn to the show because of its humor

&gt;&gt;**ohstrangeone** I've always been into science in some capacity, I'm definitely not interested in being an academic, though my curiosity and desire for scientific knowledge never left me so I always enjoy learning new things. I can't remember when I first saw the show, it was years ago, but I immediately knew it was something I would like.

&gt;#2. What do you expect from your subreddit’s community?

&gt;&gt;**demograph** From the community

&gt;&gt;**ohstrangeone** I just want them to submit lots of quality content. When I first discovered the subreddit I was shocked, it would have hundreds of thousands of subscribers--nope, it had under 1000 at the time I found it. That seemed to be because it was defunct and not really actively moderated anymore, and it had never really been promoted so most redditors who were fans of the show never even knew about it. It's exploded recently now that it's got new moderators and it was mentioned a bit in Adam Savage's recent AMA--at the time of the AMA it had about 1700 subscribers and it now has nearly 3700, so I'm quite pleased about that. We also got a couple new mods in addition to me (I petitioned the admins to make me a mod since the other two were inactive, that's how I got to be a moderator of it), one of whom is very good with CSS and has been playing around with the design a lot lately and it's coming out really, it looks so much better than it used to.

&gt;#3. What is your favorite myth that has been on the show?  Was it confirmed

&gt;&gt;**demograph** My absolute favorite myth EVER is “Is water bulletproof?”  It was featured in the episode *MythBusters: Bulletprof Water* (season 3, they jump into water.  They fired a M1 Garand rifle at a ballistics gel dummy in the deep end of the pool, and the bullet was stopped by the water, confirming the myth.

&gt;&gt;**ohstrangeone** Tough one...I really liked the one about sonic booms breaking glass

&gt;#4. Was there ever a myth that was busted that you decided you’d just go ahead and believe anyway?

&gt;&gt;**demograph** Yes – the myth of “Will duct tape stop a speeding car in its tracks?”  I don’t thinkthey went about testing that as best as they could (they didn’t try any different designs or different methods of using the duct tape) and I believe that if you use it correctly

&gt;&gt;**ohstrangeone** I think they've screwed some up, now I don't know much about that but it sounds to me like they need to go back retest it with Nylon line. Oh! Sure, I'll give you one I know they screwed up: they recently test ""Knife vs. Gun"" and every time Adam drew the gun he racked the slide: that would never be done in real life, anyone who carries a gun in real life and has a clue as to what they're doing carries with a round in the chamber (except the Israelis, but they're weird), there wouldn't be any cocking or racking of the slide going on, that added significant time to the amount of time it took him to draw and fire and definitely screwed up the results.

&gt;#5. I heard a myth that Jamie Hyneman is a robot.  How would you go about testing that out?  Or if you have tested it, or busted?

&gt;&gt;**demograph** Hahahaha, personally, would break into his house and find out, but we all know that's sort of illegal, so that's off the list. I guess there is no ""easy"" way to test it out. If he really is a robot, he has very complex programming (voice inflection, humanlike movement, not to mention superb physical building.

&gt;&gt;**ohstrangeone** Simple. X-ray. Over and done with :D

&gt;#6. Are there any myths you’ve heard you would like to see the guys tackle?

&gt;&gt; **demograph** I would like for them to do an episode on the movie Sahara. There are quite a few controversial things that could be tested on the show

&gt;&gt; **ohstrangeone** I really want to see them do some JFK assassination myths, specifically [the magic bullet theory]() where, according to the official report, one of the bullets that struck Kennedy paused in mid-air for over a second and then turned X number of degrees and struck someone or something, it's really screwy and they could have fun testing it. They could also test whether or not anyone, like they could bring in a top military sniper to do it or something, could've done the shooting that Oswald did with that old POS Mannlicher-Carcano bolt action with the misaligned scope. The ballistics would be fairly easy and straight-forward to test, so I think that would be an excellent candidate for the show.

**498 musicians covering songs in 8 months!**

First off, am still in school and had finals. They're a real pain in the ass. Especially when you haven't been paying attention all semester. It happens when you bring your laptop to class.

Having said that

It searching of a micro sub took forever. I kept pushing that damn random button

I've spent my fair share of time on /r/ICoveredASong. It's really gives me this moment of excitement when I see a post titled ""I covered [song I know]"". I understand this might not be everyone's cup of tea

My favorite covers are [Amy Winehouse redoing of old songs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFYaW4YX49c). But that's another story. But before I go on

Next think you know

So if you've redone a song and want to share it or just want to hear other peoples covers, know from experience.

DerTauman, with a name like that I would like to get to know you better.

&gt;##1. Whose idea was it to start this sub and why?

&gt;&gt; **Corrupt_Reverend** I started it because I wanted a place where covers submitted by reditors wouldn't be buried so quickly by random covers that people find online. A place to show off the latest song you learned or listen to someone else's take on other artists' music


&gt;##2. Do any of you cover songs?

&gt;&gt; **kmbroom** I cover a lot of songs. By myself and with the band I play in. It seems easier to get gigs around here if you know some good covers. The ones that I learn on my own I record and submit

&gt;&gt; **DerTauman** I'd cover songs if I was good enough at drums + had the equipment (you need mics and software to do it :()

&gt;&gt; **Corrupt_Reverend** I post covers occasionally.

&gt;##3. What instrument(s) do you play and what are your favorite songs to cover?

&gt;&gt; **kmbroom** I play bass, mandoline, some simple banjo, and basic Keyboard/synth/piano stuff. I really enjoy doing simple acoustic covers on one hand, but on the other I really enjoy learning metal songs, especially on bass.
 
&gt;&gt; **DerTauman** I play the drums but I'm not too big on covers. If I were to cover a song it'd probably be something thrashy (Overkill/Megadeth) or laid back like Porcupine Tree.

&gt;##4. Do you have any plans in motion for the future?

&gt;&gt; **kmbroom** I'm in contact with a few sponsors about contests with some pretty cool prizes, and pics for prizes. Things like that. I don't really have a timeline on these things, as speaking with companies like this seems to take an exceptionally long time.

&gt;##5. Any last things you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; **kmbroom** I'd like to add that we want everyone to get involved here. Whether you're recording you and your guitar or piano with your webcam and computer mic, although we may throw advice at you from time to time!

Today as we all know is March 14th aka 3/14/12 aka ~~apple~~ Pi day. In celebration of such a [rounded](http://i.imgur.com/IM20P.jpg) holiday I present you a subreddit worth a look and two shakes. First let me mention what makes reddit special for me. Its not the infinite amount of cat pics nor the never ending mundane facebook screens

Maybe a really bad haiku will convince you? 

    Learning is magic
    /r/ data is beautiful.
    Ohhh pretty colors! 

What are you waiting for? [Fly

&gt;##I. Who came up with the brilliant idea? Whats your mission statement? (If you have one.)

&gt;&gt; **zanycaswell** I came up with the idea. It just occurred to me that a subreddit full of data visualizations would be interesting

&gt;##II. What is your favorite ""infograph"" post so far?

&gt;&gt; **zanycaswell** [This one.](http://strangemaps.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/goldengatebridge.gif) I love how a simple representation of some statistics can be emotionally moving. [Also this](http://i.imgur.com/zRDq4.png)

&gt;##III. What in your own opinion makes data graphs soo intriguing?

&gt;&gt; **zanycaswell** A good infographic or data visualization can take something huge and make it easy to understand

&gt;&gt; **delinquentme** IMO we've got 2 major things going for curated inforgraphics: 1) demonstrative power 2) engagement. It takes a special breed of person to get excited about excel charts. Compare that to curated datasets like we've got here in r/dataisbeautiful and you've got some really powerful ways to relay heavy topics.

&gt;##IV. What is one post that caught you offguard?

&gt;&gt; **zanycaswell** [This one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png) of the US incarceration rate is just disturbing.

&gt;&gt; **delinquentme** As zanycaswell mentioned we've got the graphic of the human metabolic system. Its complex! But what makes it beautiful is the fact that at a glance anyone can easily conclude that there are a TON of ways to go about tinkering with human metabolism.

&gt;##V. Tell me about your community? And where do you see /r/dataisbeautiful going in a year?

&gt;&gt; **zanycaswell** The community is small, definitely demonstrates that. In a year, I hope we're a big, active community that's making people smarter every day.

&gt;&gt; **delinquentme** The community! I was having internet fist fights in r/askscience specifically about infographics / curated datasets. Spoke with a few admins over it and I was passed along to this community. Want solid ways to get people involved in engineering / science / technical pursuits? Show them how beautiful it can be =]

&gt;##VI. You have the last word. Say whatever you wish.

&gt;&gt; **zanycaswell** I'm not sure what to say. Just come on over and start posting!

I have to be honest. The only reason I didn't officially post my submission for ""Robot"" over at /r/dailydraw is simply because I would wipe the floor with these [terrible](http://theartofalexamezcua.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/image19.jpg) submissions. Look at [this!](http://rukshanev.deviantart.com/art/Robot-375545520) Gosh

I can't go on with the lies. I've never been great at drawing or sketching. The participants over at /r/dailydraw sure are though. They're a set of artists with a great mix of styles that keep the responses fresh and diverse. They have daily drawing challenges that are suggested by the subscribers and a contest monthly that is judged by the mods. The submissions get put in to the /r/dailydraw Hall of Fame. For example, these guys can definitely sketch. They can sketch very well. Not only that but they are a friendly and supportive community. As /u/theclosetwriter kindly said to me:

&gt;&gt;**theclosetwriter** I like to foster an environment of kindness and encouragement of creating art, and I also maintain an as-comprehensive-as-possible related subs list.

I feel that hits the nail on the head as to why it's such a pleasant Subreddit. It is highly supportive thus the content is forever flowing and just awesome.

After being contacted by /r/dailydraw I decided to ask them some questions. Really to learn more about them and /r/dailydraw:

&gt;##1. How did /r/dailydraw begin?

&gt;&gt;**theclosetwriter** The sub was created by someone else, I asked for their suggestions. 

&gt;&gt;**huisme**  I don't know how it began

&gt;&gt;**oohay_email2004** see closetwriter

&gt;##2.     Do you have an artistic background?

&gt;&gt;**theclosetwriter** I do have some artistic background if you count high school art classes! I mainly draw with graphite or charcoal. I prefer drawing the human figure. 

&gt;&gt;**huisme**  I have an artistic background

&gt;&gt;**oohay_email2004** Stopped drawing in high school

&gt;##3.     Do you have a favourite post?

&gt;&gt;**theclosetwriter** I don't know if I have a favorite posts

&gt;&gt;**huisme**  Not really. I do my best not to pick favorites because of my role as Judgemod Mc.Critique.

&gt;&gt;**oohay_email2004** Nope.

&gt;##4.     Have you participated in the daily draw?

&gt;&gt;**theclosetwriter** I have participated in the daily draw

&gt;&gt;**huisme**  Nope. Partially because I'm the judge and I wouldn't want to hurt my credibility

&gt;&gt;**oohay_email2004** Every day since I found it probably six months ago.

&gt;##5. Would you like to say anything to your Subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**theclosetwriter** I love my subscribers! They are what make this a wonderful, and kind community. I love their creativity. 

&gt;&gt;**huisme** You're all awesomtastic.

&gt;&gt;**oohay_email2004** Keep drawing!

Thanks to /r/dailydraw for inviting me to their Subreddit. If you're keen to sketch or just want to see some great art by your fellow Redditors then sub up to /r/dailydraw.

A boy and his friends play a game together.

From the mind of Andrew Hussie comes the longest webcomic in history, and how much nonsense it is to someone who isn't.

A unique mix of a text-based adventure game, and a coming of age tale, Homestuck is an entity of it's own, currently totaling at over 4,200 pages, and counting!

Having a large following, HiddenKrypt, cationsk, Makinporing, and Cyborg711!


&gt;So. For all those who don't know. What IS Homestuck?

&gt;&gt;**Cyborg711:** At it's core it's a mind bending tale about time travel, relationships, and destiny. On the surfacemost layers it's about how awesome Nic Cage movies are and how many times the author can screw with his fans before they condemn him to a fiery pit. As far as webcomics go, it's very unique. It is the longest webcomic currently in existence (by page count) and incorporates music, flash animation, and even full on interactive segments modeled after classes SNES titles like Earthbound (the inspiration for the name. Home=Earth, Stuck=Bound).

&gt;&gt;**HiddenKrypt:** Homestuck is a webcomic written by Andrew Hussy that explores the unique storytelling options available to the web.
Homestuck is an internet event surrounded by a rabidy loyal fandom.
Homestuck is a story that starts as the tale of a young man's 13th birthday

&gt;&gt;**cationsk:** Four kids start playing the sims when suddenly armageddon happens; also

&gt;When did you start reading Homestuck?

&gt;&gt;**Makinporing:** Around May 2010.

&gt;&gt;**mechjesus:** What brought me into it was a .swf file I found on 4chan where John and his dad are fighting about a cake. I loved it so much I tracked it down to its source and have been hooked since.

&gt;&gt;**cationsk:** 4/13/2009 (the beginning). I've been reading MSPaint Adventures (Hussie's website) since the middle of Problem Sleuth

&gt;What do you like most about it?

&gt;&gt;**HiddenKrypt:** The characters

&gt;&gt;**Cyborg711:** I love the story. Andrew Hussie is very talented at writing engaging dialog and managing complex tales full of twists and paradoxes. It's become common for the community to scream his name (HUSSIEEEEEEEE) on forums and the like whenever they realize that the latest twist in the story was actually foreshadowed 3000 pages ago and nobody picked up on it until today.

&gt;&gt;**Makinporing:** I've always loved fantasy and science fiction

&gt;What DON'T you like?

&gt;&gt;**mechjesus:** I am a recovering Tumblr user

&gt;&gt;**cationsk:** That weird part of the fandom. (In case anyone thinks that they're part of what I'm talking about

&gt;&gt;**Makinporing:** I'd have to say the drama surrounding some parts of the fandom (for example Tumblr) is the worst part about it.

&gt;&gt;**Cyborg711:** There are portions of the fan community that like to roleplay as characters from the comic in public and

&gt;&gt;**HiddenKrypt:** Well, at times. The story is not told in a linear fashion, which is fitting, as with all the time-travel shenanigans and multi-dimentional narratives, it would be hard to do otherwise. Unfortunately, hussy also likes holding details back, and brings in classical storytelling elements such as flashbacks as a way to fill us in on the things he intentionally withheld the first time. This leads to many of his huge flash updates including a variety of scenes that aren't always in any sort of order, this is all a big part of the charm of homestuck for me and many others. It just makes it hard on new readers

&gt;What kinds of posts do you most often see on this sub?

&gt;&gt;**HiddenKrypt:** A mix of posts linking to the most recent update, or fan voiced videos. We also see a lot of plot discussion threads, though these also fit in the comments for links to the updates.

&gt;&gt;**cationsk:** Update discussion threads,... There's a lot of creativity going on in here.

&gt;What would you recommend to a first time reader

&gt;&gt;**Cyborg711:** Start with Problem Sleuth. It may be tempting to jump in to Homestuck but it's daunting and it starts a bit slow. Problem Sleuth is a known quantity (and it's fantastic) and if you don't enjoy it you're unlikely to truly enjoy Homestuck. If you do insist on jumping head first into Homestuck then don't make a judgement call until End of Act 2. That's when it really hits it's stride (Act 6 just started a few weeks ago). Finally

&gt;&gt;**Makinporing:** Some people won't like it at first

&gt;&gt;**mechjesus:** As with all things that are well written

&gt;Finally

&gt;&gt;**HiddenKrypt:** Love you guys. Srsly.

&gt;&gt;**cationsk:** There was this guy a while ago who was making a text adventure game about the felt intermission. I'd love to know how that's going. And to everyone else: you people are crazy

&gt;&gt;**Makinporing:** Keep being awesome!

&gt;&gt;**Cyborg711:** I WARNED YOU ABOUT SUBSCRIBING BRO!!! I TOLD YOU DOG!

&gt;&gt;**mechjesus:** I am amazed at how fast this subreddit grew. When I found it there were 4 posts total. Though I don't post near as much now

And that's all, prepare your Strife Specibus, and jump into **Homestuck**!

P.S. Hussie's website, Homestuck being his most recent. Be sure to give it a looksie!

Here’s something you may not know about your friendly neighborhood Freakazette – she is a filmmaker.  And I’m not saying like, 1st AD, and I have actually filmed on film.  My IMDB credits are for script supervisor and PA work.

Surprise!  And no, you’ll tell your friends, your friends are calling me on the horn all the time, I gotta show up at shopping centers for openings and sign autographs and shit like that and it makes my life a living *hell*, okay?  A living hell.

Stolen rant aside, giving advice to newbies, showing off your work, and just simply talking shop can be found on this subreddit.

I sat down with /u/ancientworldnow

&gt;#1. What made you want to get involved with /r/filmmakers?

&gt;&gt;**ancientworldnow** I started the sub about 3.5 years ago originally as a place to store interesting links I found about film for later perusal. At the time

&gt;&gt;After about a year or so of posting for my own benefit (subscribers: 1) I decided to start advertising to attract some of the many film professionals on Reddit and hopefully benefit from the shared knowledge pool. The number of subscribers quickly took off and we soon surpassed the numbers of the original /r/wearethefilmmakers.

&gt;&gt;After much demand, and video professionals, amateurs, and hobbyists of Reddit.


&gt;#2. What do you expect from the community?

&gt;&gt;**ancientworldnow** When we combined the more amateur focused subreddits with the more professional oriented ones

&gt;&gt;We see a lot of people posting their work and receiving harsh criticism from some of the more experienced users

&gt;#3. Who are some filmmakers that inspire you?

&gt;&gt;**ancientworldnow** I split my time as a director of photography (DP) and a colorist so my answers are a little different than what you'd probably find from the typical subreddit user. We're really fortunately to be living in a great time for cinematography with some of the most talented DP's ever working in a variety of styles and with more tools than ever before at their disposal. To name off just a few of my favorites right now you have Deakins, Elswit, and Richardson to name just a few. And of course, no list is complete without mention of Conrad Hall or the recently passed Harry Savides.

My first memory of doing a Secret Santa, but I'm sure my *mom* picked out something nice, but the gift I got, oh my God. While everyone else got bits and baubles, and big Books of Lifesavers, my Secret Santa got me a beautiful black stuffed dog that was well over the spending limit. Her family, like mine, so it meant all the more. And to top it off

It all went so well that the next year I was all gung ho. *I* was going to pick the present this time! In our secret santa, and she had me. I searched high and low for a perfect present. A real Barbie was out of the price limit, and I was still at an age where I was afraid to break rules, so after much internal debate I got her an off-brand Barbie. I was **so excited,** even though she came from a very well-off family, I thought she'd understand, since there *was a rule and all* and they really cracked down after the previous year of individuals overspending on gifts. 

On gift  exchange day

While I was waiting for her mom to wrap up (and I now realize *pick out*) my present, half chewed by the dog, like a dead prostitute in the opening of Law and Order.

My gift wasn't *loved.* To add insult to injury

As I walked my lonely four block walk home in not-quite-knee-high snow, the shoe bag but mostly about the huge turnaround from how happy I was just the year before, and how well it all went (on my part). If your enemy can give you the best gift ever, and the exchange with a good friend makes you sad, well, I was realizing that this gift giving thing is an odd business. 

And just maybe that year I learned **the true meaning of christmas!** 

(or any gift giving occasion)

The truth is I had fun looking for that present

I guess good always outweighs the [bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/nuz57/my_secret_santa_gift_was_a_shirt_that_did_not_fit/) And I think the participants of reddit's secret santa will tell you the [same.](http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/faith-humaity-restored-3/)

Note: Once you sign up your secret santa will need to get to know you. One, 'cause your secret santa will be checking them twice!

**Mod 5days was kind enough to take time out during their busiest time of the year to talk with me:**

&gt;##1. How did Secret Santa become a thing? How did it start?

&gt;&gt; **5days** On our Thanksgiving vacation in 2009

&gt;&gt;We ran redditgifts in our spare time from our home for the next 2 years, /u/Someguyfromcanada, and /u/Weffey We added Arbitrary Day in June, Trick or Treat for Halloween and the smaller niche exchanges, like books and My Little Pony. In September of 2011 reddit acquired us and we were able to devote ourselves to it full time. That was pretty exciting! Since then we have moved into our own office and hired the fabulous /u/weffey. She has been involved in Secret Santa and a moderator for a long time. She was a perfect fit for our little team. We have also added a new artist, /u/youngluck, who painted the current Secret Santa banner with the [sweetest looking cats in the world.](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2012/)

&gt;##2. What is your first Christmas present that you remember getting?

&gt;&gt; **5days** When I was about four or five I received a stuffed Chewbacca. We also got board games and stuff but

&gt;##3. What is the most memorable gift you have ever given or received?

&gt;&gt; **5days** I think my first Secret Santa gift was the most memorable to give. I spent a lot of time on it and my person was really happy. It's hard to choose a most memorable gift received. Kickme444, I received an awesome [Frankenstein figure.](http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/frankenstein/) He's my favorite monster and I keep it on my desk.

&gt;##4. How did you get involved with Secret Santa?

&gt;&gt; **5days** I was also on that Thanksgiving vacation so I just jumped in. We were visiting family in Utah (we lived in California at the time). Kickme444 and I work really well together so it was really organic and fun.
    
&gt;##5. There's a rumor I hear about reddit's Secret Santa gift exchange and the Guinness Book of World Records. Can you tell us more about that?

&gt;&gt; **5days** After a lot of work by Someguyfromcanada and reddit,000 participants. This year, we have the go ahead to try to beat the record. We already have 50,000 people signed up so I think it will happen : ) It's pretty exciting. I think a lot of us grew up with the Guinness World Record books and secretly dreamed of someday holding one.

&gt;##6. I've never done this. How can I sign up

&gt;&gt; **5days** You can sign up at [redditgifts.](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2012/) We have an extensive [faq](http://redditgifts.com/faq/) along with /r/secretsanta. 

&gt;##7. What if someone signs up and sends a gift

&gt;&gt; **5days** Unfortunately

&gt;##8. Is there anything I missed

&gt;&gt; **5days** The main rule of Secret Santa is, everyone will be happy : )

&gt;&gt;We do have something new to add! We have just opened the new redditgifts [Marketplace.](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/) We are creating a place that features cool and interesting things, including Breadpig, Cadence, Soapier and many others. Kickme444 and Weffey have been working super hard on this and we are all really excited about it.

/r/badMovies is a celebration of films that have high levels of entertainment and higher levels of WTF.  Films that are great because they're so bad; movies that hurt so good.  Now if it was another art form, no one has a good laugh.  But making movies is really hard!  I can only imagine it's like childbirth.  I mean, passing a newborn through my urethra *must* be comparable to making a film.  I don't know if these people set out to make a crappy film, or the end result is crap and they couldn't see it coming, but if you go to /r/badMovies, you'll have tons of clips to go through in order to make up your own mind.

We salute you, something to think about, and another reason to bring up Nicholas Cage in conversation.  Here to discuss /r/badMovies are the moderator team, DrMilkdad, lake_troll, and gamerofdestiny.

&gt;Why do we like bad movies? By definition

&gt;&gt;DrMilkdad:   I think it's because while we appreciate the serious effort that has obviously been put into the films

&gt;&gt;lake_troll:  I'd say because it's hilarious to watch failures, it has to have that extra input where they tried really hard to make a good movie.

&gt;&gt;gamerofdestiny:  People enjoy guilty pleasures and laughing at the ridiculous. I love the good, cheesey movie filled with terrible acting and poor production values. A difficult-to-follow barbarian flick or a unfrightening horror-movie can find new life as an unintentional comedy.

&gt;Does this phenomena exist anywhere else in the world of arts &amp; culture? That is

&gt;&gt;I think the whole rage face is an example of people getting a kick out of bad art, they fail very spectacularly as video games yet are funny and entertaining to play.

&gt;&gt;laketroll:  Modern Art

&gt;&gt;gamerofdestiny:  A lot of people love ""dumpster diving"" and outdated hand-me-downs even though they have the money to buy nice, just that you're able to enjoy something a little different.

&gt;Very well then

&gt;&gt;DrMilkdad:  **The Room**, has terrible acting and special effects, it is glorious.

&gt;&gt;lake_troll:  Easy, Tommy Wiseau takes the bad movie to a whole new level. There's a reason he is the posterboy for the subreddit.

&gt;&gt;gamerofdestiny:  Our essential list is a good place to start. My personal favorites are **Laser Mission** and **1990: The Bronx warrior**. If you haven't found something laughably stupid in them to laugh at in the first ten minutes...well

&gt;I'll give you three situations

&gt;third date with a lady who loves horror films.

&gt;&gt;DrMilkdad:  **Troll 2**

&gt;&gt;lake_troll:  Horror movie fan eh? **Troll 2**

&gt;&gt;gamerofdestiny:  **Chopping Mall**. Rogue mall security robots terrorize a bunch of dumb teenagers who decide to party inside the mall after closing. There's something of a romance subplot but most of the teens die anyway when they decide to be very stupid.

&gt;weekend at the cabin

&gt;&gt;DMD:  **Shark Attack 3: Megalodon**

&gt;&gt;LT:   Lots of people? Bring out the ol **Shark Attack 3: Megalodon**

&gt;&gt;GOD: **Deadly Prey**. Sparse dialogue

&gt;pet just died

&gt;&gt;DMD:  **1990: The Bronx Warriors**

&gt;&gt;LT:  I don't think I laughed so hard at any other bad movie than this scene from **Robowar**

&gt;&gt;GOD:  Oh ha ha

&gt;It's your turn

&gt;&gt;DMD: Thanks for keeping the subbreddit going from just the three of us posting clips and trailers of movies we've seen or wanted to see. For soon to be subscribers

&gt;&gt;LT:  We have taken badmovies from less than 200 subscribers to where it is now and the hours of entertainment I have received from people who post here is awesome. There is really nothing better than getting together with a group of friends to watch a shitty movie with a few beers. So join up and post your favourites

&gt;&gt;GOD:  Keep up the good work. Spread the word of r/badmovies to the point where everybody ""gets it"" and never again asks 'Why do you like something that you know is bad?'

Thank you my good friends

**419**shirt aficionados for only **3 years?!?!?!**

Shirts made by reddit for reddit. You may have heard of them, where your hard earned money not only gets you reddit created merchandise but also help a great cause. Redditgifts had partnered up with Watsi during the past Arbitrary day events. A great Charity that directly helped fund medical treatment to people in need. 

But that was the old plan. The new plan is even bigger, /r/Redditshirts, wants you, the viewer to nominate other charities for them to help raise money for. Its literally a win-win here you guys. I mean, unless you're a commie who worships Satan. Then its a lose-lose.

Actually, go to /r/Redditshirts, subscribe, If you're artsy fartsy, post your designs. If you have a great idea for a Charity you know, go mention it. Then wait for the admins/mods to pick one and then go on a shopping spree. 

---

&gt;#1. What got you guys involved with /r/redditshirts?

&gt;&gt;**/u/kickme444** For a bit of background

&gt;&gt;The basic idea of selling shirts for charity is something we've seen the reddit community do a few times on their own in various subreddits and we wanted to see if we put reddit behind it

&gt;&gt;When we launched the [redditgifts Marketplace](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/) last year

&gt;#2. Can we suggest charities? If not now

&gt;&gt;**kickme444** YES please!  Just head over to /r/redditshirts and make a post about your favorite charity and why.

&gt;#3. What if

&gt;&gt;**kickme444** We certainly feel like with the right shirt design

&gt;#4. What kind of design(s) are you NOT looking for?

&gt;&gt;**kickme444** Well, it'd be things that are crude.  redditgifts is largely SFW and we should probably keep it that way.

&gt;#5. Any other way we can help? (This can also be your chance for a public soup box)

&gt;&gt;**kickme444** Let me get up on this soup box for a minute and talk about the opportunity we have here.  Here on reddit, great!  If you find a charity to support, awesome!  If you come up with a new idea for how to make the world suck just a little bit less, PLEASE share it with us, or your community.  That is our goal here at redditgifts, and /r/redditshirts, to make the world suck just a little bit less!

The Butthole. The *BUTTHOLE*. I have seen it

Now, so I couldn’t take a picture of it or my expression as I was seeing it. Believe me, it is horrible, I hope you never see it.

I am now one of the people on /r/WeHaveSeenTheButthole, some thrice, maybe even fourice, if that’s even a word. Could someone from /r/Logophilia help me out on that one?

It seems that you seeing the Butthole is inevitable, [Bert’s seen it](http://i.imgur.com/AgsGW.gif), and even [Pinkie Pie](http://i.imgur.com/IPngP0L.gif). It’s spreading, and it’s spreading fast.

When you hear the word 'juggling', you probably view this act as a difficult skill that is hard to master. This, however, is not the case! Juggling is easy; as it is defined by [Wikipedia, juggling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling), is ""a physical skill involving the manipulation of objects for recreation, entertainment or sport"".

Unless you're reading this article from a tablet or a phone, reader! The mouse you're using is an object! And you've physically manipulated it! You can juggle! Before you get too excited about your newfound skill, realize that the manipulation of a mouse is a very low form of juggling, at least in my eyes. In order to improve on your new skill, you'll need to perfect it. You'll need to gather knowledge and practice.

That's where the /r/juggling subreddit comes in! [Tutorials](http://www.reddit.com/r/juggling/comments/od5zd/tutorial_i_made_for_the_ija_tutorial_contest_it/), you can develop your mouse-moving skill into something more impressive; you can bean-bag juggle, club-juggle, or [chainsaw-juggle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=PbMvxLRdpm0#t=15s). You'll quickly be surprised how [many juggling methods](http://i.imgur.com/G56zeg0.gif) there are! (or maybe you won't be surprised, I apologize for how patronizing I've been.)

&gt;##What do you like about juggling? Why did you first learn to juggle?
&gt;&gt; **Clackpot** I like juggling because it is difficult, and inventive. Jugglers tend to very much to be people who do things because they are a challenge, and not because they are easily attainable.  
I first learned to juggle because I'd spent many happy hours watching street acts at Covent Garden back in the 80s, and I stayed hooked. Two years later I was in full-time circus school, and the rest, as they say, is history.

&gt;&gt; **Raerth** I'm more a spinner than a tosser. I'm competent with poi, and just about cascade clubs. Love fire spinning as well. Got into it back when I did a lot of raving as I'm a shit dancer...

&gt;##How has your experience been moderating /r/juggling?
&gt;&gt; **Clackpot** A little background for you : There are three moderators, but this is a small sub and it's easy to handle by one person.

&gt;&gt; **Raerth** It was actually me who asked you to join the team ;)
/r/Juggling was the first subreddit I moderated

&gt;##What type of content do you hope that new subscribers will bring?
&gt;&gt; **Raerth** We've got members of all competencies in /r/juggling

&gt;&gt; **Clackpot** /r/juggling has grown slowly but steadily since I've been a subscriber, with some more involved debate going on. I would also like to see the wiki begin to enjoy more development by our user base. Ultimately I would hope that we would become more of a place for jugglers to hang out and talk about all the weird and wonderful things that interest us, rather than merely talking about juggling. It turns out that jugglers are so much more interesting than just the juggling that they do.

Juggling is definitely a skill that I would [recommend picking up](http://www.howcast.com/videos/944-How-to-Juggle-Three-Balls), ladies love the jugglers!",,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,WRITER,

Hi

I had this whole big speech planned out about boobs and how they make the world go *round*^1 and how that would help make my *points* more clear.

In the end I decided to just say boobs

&gt;##1. What made you decide to come up with a subreddit dedicated to boobs?
&gt;&gt; **Bagel**: Boobs are a representation of freedom - life

&gt;##2. Why do you like boobs?
&gt;&gt; **Bagel**: Because boobs?

&gt;##3. What are your favorite things about boobs?
&gt;&gt; **Bagel**: This is not an answerable question. Man's natural

&gt;##4. Who owns your favorite set of boobs?
&gt;&gt; **Bagel**: I don't know if I can claim a favorite set - there's too many to choose from.

&gt;##5. What’s your favorite nickname for a set of boobs?

Before I begin this journey of an article you must all take off your shoes (and dirty socks) and only read the following featurette in sweet slow whisper. For this is a tribute that shall be presented to the most holiest of video gaming Deities. I am talking about the one and only Gabe Newell. This is no ordinary subreddit

To do so properly one must know how a mere man attained such power. Gabe Newell, worked for Microsoft, made some money, quit, made Valve with Mike, which created Half Life &amp; Steam, then ascended to [Godhood](http://i.imgur.com/o3F4t.jpg). A fine example of what greatness one man can harness if he so chooses to go down such a noble path.

If you've been living under a rock or don't have a computer to play video games on; 1) I'm so sorry for you. 2) What is wrong with you? 3) I'm here for you but only on weekends and you have to provide the beer. Valve single handedly revolutionized PC gaming. Trust me, what the future holds, right Mr Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeman?

Full disclaimer, I've personally moved away from gaming. This is due to personal preferences and finding other things to fill my time with. This has nothing to do with the present state of ""gaming"". But like I mentioned above, you gotta give respect where it's due. I know when I finally do go back and revisit some of my older games or even play new ones. I will always thank Gabe for what he has done for the community. And this is why /r/Gaben was made, to honor him, love him and cherish him for he is all that is right &amp; good.

*High Tech - Low Life!*

Before I begin asking semi-rhetorical questions like, some of the best cyberpunk examples out there are based on [film noir](/r/classicfilms). To further grease your gears, cyberpunk writers love substituting present day social issues with artificial ones so to better commentate on present day society. I have yet to see a problem here folks.

The *look* of /r/Cyberpunk's itself sells it completely. [Dark with neon glowing text everywhere](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/033/b/4/b4f9ce3b948391fcb8922ee65c0724af-d4oh49q.jpg). The content posted there is [diverse](http://www.artbyfeng.com/images/gallery_image_514.jpg) in a positive way and with something [fun](http://imgur.com/kMLUp) always around the corner. For all you fucturetech addicts / 90's hackers this is a must subscribe.

###Q &amp; A is up!

&gt;##I. What is cyberpunk in your own words?

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** Cyberpunk means different things to different people, on ""the Edge"": criminals, outcasts, visionaries or those who simply want freedom for its own sake. Cyberpunk literature focuses on these people, and often on how they turn the system's technological tools to their own ends. ""The Street finds its own uses for things."" This is the ""punk"" aspect of Cyberpunk. It is also a subculture or social classification including hackers, crackers, phreaks

&gt;&gt; **D3cker** The world we live in today


&gt;##II.a Do you see a world where there are cyborgs among us? What would they look like?

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** [Cyborgs are already among us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lqNO3hij_E). So far

&gt;&gt; **D3cker** This is unstoppable

&gt;##II.b If so

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** Yeah

&gt;&gt; **D3cker** I hope so

&gt;##II.c If not

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** I don't know. When it can't reproduce??? But then again

&gt;&gt; **D3cker** I believe the question should be: At what point does the machine become more human than the machine... aka *self aware*.

&gt;##II.d Would you be pro-bot-choice or pro-human-life?

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** pro-human as long as it the definition of ""bot"" isn't something bureaucratic like someone who has some basic body modifications or something.

&gt;&gt; **D3cker** I say life for both.

&gt;##III. What is your cyberpunk fantasy world like?

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** ""The Grid"" from Tron:Legacy. I love this movie and I wish it was real! lol :D

&gt;&gt; **D3cker** [Hong Kong](http://i.imgur.com/Usg0U.jpg)

&gt;##IV. Tell us about your community? What makes them so cool?

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** Our community is diverse and we love to immerse ourselves in this culture. Whether it's reading the books, hacking, listening to cyberpunk music, or a combination of all of these things, we think about it daily as it is a part of our lives.

&gt;##V. Anything I missed? Mention it here.

&gt;&gt; **Fraktul** I'll briefly mention how I first encountered this movement/social order. I read Neuromancer by William Gibson when I was a kid and at the time I was already war dialing and hacking BBS's with my dad's Commodore 64. This world that Gibson was talking about in his books just sang to me, multinational megacorporations, etc.) and that the genre is becoming more mainstream. I've always been attracted to this lifestyle and I love it! ",,False,self,t5_2sgno,,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/q0o6o/february_22_2012_rcyberpunk_all_things_change_in/

Full disclosure, but we're trying to reach out to the less fortunate.  Thank you xhamster, I hope you're having a happy day! (ya daft git!)

Sooooo, and who the hell is this Carl Sagan guy anyway?  You say gonewild has you *gone mild*?

It's okay sugartits.  Daddy's got a subreddit for you to make it all better...  it's called /r/karmacidewatch, make a post that is totally anti hive mind.  I know, crazy huh? And apparently it's called karmacide!  You may be setting yourself up for criticism or you might find souls that ""feel ya"".  Feel me?

I truly could not explain this subreddit better than our guest moderators, but not for all people.  Ask your doctor before interacting with aidsinabarrel or simmerian.  Discuss your general health status with your doctor to ensure that you are healthy enough to engage in sexual activity. If you experience chest pain, nausea, or any other discomforts during conversations with aidsinabarrel, seek immediate medical help.  In the rare event of an erection lasting more than 4 hours, while in the presence of these guys, seek immediate medical help to avoid long-term injury.

&gt;Please tell us exactly what the hell /r/karmacidewatch is!

&gt;&gt;/r/karmacidewatch is interesting for a few reasons. The first is the extreme level of bravery of this subreddit to go against reddit popular opinion with other viable thought out points of view. Reddit doesn't understand that it has a lot more potential to be a mecca of human communication if it would stop for a minute and decide that that's what it wanted to do. Not everywhere on the planet has reddit but it can be the first step in a global forum where everybody has a voice. 

&gt;&gt;Second, my goal anyways is to get reddit to stop stroking it for 10 minutes to do something worthwhile. Maybe someday governments will no longer exist and we'll have moderators instead, attention is brought to important things through something similar to upvotes. The internet is a tool that needs to be exploited, knowledge is the ultimate weapon and honestly the battlefield is larger with greater repercussions than either world war. People say censorship is no big deal but considering that the printing press is a pinnacle of human communication the internet is that times a million. Ok, maybe not times a million but the fact we can instantly communicate is huuuge, the fact that there is instant ramification to the things you say and do is huge as well, and it is important to note that this is the precise reason our governments are currently failing, hurry google translate!)

&gt;How did this subreddit start? What's the creation story?

&gt;&gt;[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/ost7b/if_this_post_gets_1000_upvotes_i_will_go_into/c3jt0yt) made by /u/sushisushisushi in an /r/circlejerk thread. As the creator of the subreddit

&gt;Is /r/karmacidewatch serious

&gt;&gt;That's not our decision to make

&gt;Has /r/karmacidewatch improved reddit.com? If so

&gt;&gt;It's a matter of opinion. I like it here and so do other people. /r/karmacide allows you to say what you want where people will actually see it. You can say what you want

&gt;Tell us about the community members... three descriptive words or phrases that most of your readers fit into.

&gt;&gt;Brave, that's what this is really about. Fuck karma, jerk more, it's so easy to get karma. It means nothing because it's definition is different for everybody and it's validity is different depending on who you talk to. What it means is literally nothing.

&gt;What's the future of your subreddit - how can we

&gt;&gt;That's not up to us

&gt;Your turn with the mic. Please

&gt;&gt;Be brave and do not fear downvotes. Take pride in what you say - your point of view is as valid as everybody elses and vice versa. Keep this in mind and we can utilize instant global communication as a way to regulate ourselves.

Hello

The feminine aspect of reddit sometimes seems underrepresented on reddit.  The frontpage seems to always have a musky, as our favorite communal hobby is drinking scotch and making menstruation puns. How are the reddettes supposed to get their rocks off (or at least be mildly titillated), you ask? I submit to you /r/LadyBoners, the subreddit for sharing one's favorite piece of male meat with the world.

obsessive_cook, excessive ladybonering lead to a torn ACL. (Please ladyboner responsibly, everyone.) Fortunately, PassivePony and Ms_Gaea, both mods at LB, stepped in to help. 

&gt;What inspired the creation of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;PassivePony: A thread on 2X created the need in the market for this sub, and talking about qualities they got ""ladyboners"" for. So, obsessive_cook created the sub and posted in the thread, I volunteered to mod in the same thread, and boom it took off right away. Then it started growing like crazy, and Ms_Gaea offered her services about 4 months ago, and then sodypop came on about a week ago to tweak our CSS for us. It's been a fun 7 months

&gt;Who is your favorite ladyboner-inducing celebrity?

&gt;&gt; (ms_gaea): This is a tough one but I would say

&gt;Do redditors have diverse choices in LB material

&gt;&gt;(PassivePony) Oh yes, as is the naked Adam Levine pic. But we do get tons of diversity from anime characters to Neil DeGrasse Tyson to Moot (who showed up on his verified account and caused quite a stir).

&gt;What are some rules/etiquette for contributing to /r/LadyBoners?

&gt;&gt; (ms_gaea): We are still teasing out the finer points of our official “Rules” here at LadyBoners

&gt;&gt;A major one is “Please do not down vote submissions”. We’re an eclectic bunch of folks in here and some peoples’ fancy may be tickled by somebody that others find less than delightful. If this is the case

&gt;&gt;Another rule to take heed of is avoiding post of ones self (aka camera whoring). There are plenty of subreddits already in place for that. This is more of a forum for sharing well known individuals (or the occasionally dreamy redditor if they are okay with it).

&gt;&gt;Oh

&gt;Who was your first Lady Boner? Do you still have similar feelings toward that person?

&gt;&gt;(PassivePony) Oh boy

&gt;What are you looking forward to for the future of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;(ms_gaea): The continued growth in readership and the diversity which additional people will bring to our frontpage!

&gt;What's been the most difficult part of moderating LadyBoners?

&gt;&gt;(PassivePony) Having to tell dudes that post themselves that it's a no-no. You can nominate other Redditors, which ironically curries sympathy and laughs and therefore upvotes, thus defeating it's purpose. We're not going to get rid of it though, it's too much fun to use! Other than that it's just clearing the spam queue and watching for trolls. It's such a fun, awesome community, nothing is really hard about modding LadyBoners :P

&gt;What is your favorite part of the community?

&gt;&gt;(PassivePony) The people, sometimes it gets serious, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBoners/comments/jzn11/this_guy_seriously/). Not only are the submissions great, but the discussions that can crop up around them are as well.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers?

&gt;&gt;(PassivePony) Thank you for being rad! We've grown so fast in our 7 months and our readers are the reason why, we have hot dudes and pretty ladies everywhere, but what makes us unique is our community. I think our readers should also know that we're here to serve them and depend on their feedback to make it even better. Want things changed, feel conflicted about something etc.? Please tell us, that's what we're here for!

From the tastiest little restaurant chain to the friendliest little (enormous) nation on Earth; this time I am bringing you across the Ameristralian Superhighway to the polite and peaceful country of New Zanada! Known for its love of Rugby-On-Ice and its unfailing courtesy and deference to its (slightly) more powerful neighbours

Take for instance the adorable (and fierce) [Kiwoose.](http://i.imgur.com/cVeZUQR.jpg) Born blind and without it's majestic antlers, and has been known to take down much larger prey, much like the dingo of South Ameristralia. 

The population of New Zanada lives in two distinct areas; Upper New Zanada and Lower New Zanada. There are some interesting stereotypes about each of these areas: for example it has been said that people from Lower New Zanada take great pride in the game of Ice Hockey, with the favourite shows being [The Great White North (with Bret and Jemaine) and Flight of the Mckenzies](http://i.imgur.com/3Zmo4SJ.jpg) The national heroes are Pierre Trudeau and Colin Meads, and male culture is dominated by The Three R's: Rugby, Curling, and Beer. 

I spoke with the mods of /r/NewZanada to learn more about this amazing place.

&gt;What was the impetus behind this great union?

&gt;&gt;**polkacriminal:** It came about as a result of /r/Ameristralia being formed. Some redditors made the point that the New Zealand/Australia relationship is much like the Canada/United States relationship. As a result

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes:** It all started when Ameristrlia was made. Somebody made a comment on a post that it was only a matter of time until New Zanada was made, so I became a mod.

&gt;&gt;**MonThrasher314:** It started off when America and Australia got massive bromances for each other, New Zanada was born.

&gt;How is the competitive Rugby-On-Ice league coming?

&gt;&gt;**polkacriminal:** Incredibly. Sports are a serious business in New Zanada. That is definitely one area where we perform better than the rest.

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes:** Rugby-on-ice is going great if you're not afraid of injuries. It's one of the most dangerous games in the world.

&gt;&gt;**MonThrasher314:** Boy

&gt;What economic boons/impacts will the planned Maple Syrup pipeline have to the nation?

&gt;&gt;**polkacriminal:** Honestly

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes:** The maple syrup pipeline will definitely have an effect on the pancake and waffle business. Real New Zanadians put maple syrup on everything

&gt;&gt;**MonThrasher314:** While the pipeline is sure to provide delicious toppings and succulent flavour for our foods, it sure will be an expensive hassle getting the bloody thing up.

&gt;What are some of the challenges this subreddit has faced thus far?

&gt;&gt;**polkacriminal:** There really haven't been any yet. We get the occasional Ameristralian that comes in and call us New Zanadians names

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes:** We did have a bit of a tough time trying to decide what the national animal should be

&gt;&gt;**MonThrasher314:** Challenges? Not too many. The worst thing would likely be the extremist Ameristralians who come with throwaways and insults to try and put us down. But we're a hardy and apologetic folk

&gt;What can potential New Zanadians look forward to?

&gt;&gt;**polkacriminal:** New Zanadians can look forward to a peaceful community that stays out of conflict and doesn't act like they're better than everyone else (looking at you

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes:** As far as what potential New Zanadans can look forward to

&gt;&gt;**MonThrasher314:** If you're looking to be a New Zanadian, as well as free healthcare. Overall, a better place than /r/Ameristralia. ^^^sorry

&gt;Off topic question: What is the first thing you notice about a girl/guy?

&gt;&gt;**polkacriminal:** Usually

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes:** The first thing I notice in a girl is her face. To me

&gt;&gt;**MonThrasher314:** The first thing I notice about a girl would be her face. Not gonna lie

&gt;Any words for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**polkacriminal:** Thank you for joining the community and adding so much to it. Obviously it couldn't be done without you guys. Hopefully we'll continue to grow and spread the word about the great country of New Zanada!

&gt;&gt;**Musicmantobes:** As for our subscribers, flag designs, and subreddit ideas have been truly amazing. The effort that some people put in really makes me happy to be a part of this subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**MonThrasher314:** To the subscribers, and the subreddit wouldn't be where it is without you!

**814 Readers** for **2 Months!**

Servers, and have to deal with a lot of terrible customers. Plus, balancing plates and cups on a tray is never easy. Doing so while being yelled at for an under-cooked slab of indiscernible meat is another thing entirely.

And so we have /r/talesfromyourserver. A look through the eyes of the people who prolong your existence with consumable food products. People are strange, while others border on the disgusting. It's all in good fun, but not something I'd like to read before going out to eat.

A big subject on this subreddit is tipping. Tipping is something that comes up

I ~~bombarded~~ politely submitted to the moderators a few questions. They were happy to oblige.

(**EDIT**: Added responses from the subreddit creator

&gt;#1. It's hard to believe such insane conditions are so prevalent. What would you say makes this so common?

&gt;&gt;**INNAppropriate** Just the difference in people and attitudes. There are lots of servers who touch hundreds of people everyday. All that contact leads to crazy things.

&gt;&gt;**PudgyPenguin** The fact that there are a lot of different people in the world, or just going into restaurants in general.

&gt;#2. Tell us about yourselves! (Feel free to boast.)

&gt;&gt;**INNAppropriate** I'm INNAppropriate

&gt;&gt;**PudgyPenguin** My age is 23, in the US. I own my place of employment, and usually a cook, although I do waitress every once in a while. I'm more of a sally-of-all-trades. As demanding as it may be, I do love my job, and the people I work with on a daily basis, along with my regular customers.

&gt;&gt;**CaptainJMorgan** My family bloodlines are descended from a pirate

&gt;#3. You're in a Canadian McDonalds

&gt;&gt;**INNAppropriate** According to this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_tSU_XpR8A)

&gt;&gt;**PudgyPenguin** The souls of gingers.

&gt;&gt;**CaptainJMorgan** On behalf of all canadians

&gt;#4. What job do you believe is harder: Server

&gt;&gt;**INNAppropriate** President of Azerbaijan - My U.S. History teacher said something I will never forget: ""Being president is a tough job. No matter what decision you make

&gt;&gt;**PudgyPenguin** Server, they have to deal with managers and customers at the same time, and it can be a nightmare. Although, President is a close second.

&gt;&gt;**CaptainJMorgan** Being the president of any country is harder than anything. That said they don't have to deal with the inane stupidity of people asking dumb questions

&gt;#5. Where do you see your community going in the future? Paris? The Servers Take Manhatten has a nice ring to it.

&gt;&gt;**INNAppropriate** I don't want to go to Paris

&gt;&gt;**PudgyPenguin** Our community has already gone global by being on Reddit. We hope to see it become one of the top subreddits, a good experience, or even a bad one. We hope that the food service workers of reddit find our community and ask us for advice, or post the good and bad parts of their day. Really we hope that it just gets bigger, better, and it expands. :)

&gt;&gt;**CaptainJMorgan** Personally I like the direction the subreddit has gone! It really blew up, or attention so I'm humbled to be honest. Thank you for your consideration.

Another big thanks to the great staff at /r/talesfromyourserver. Be kind to your server

Growing up in a large (American) Irish Catholic family

Second, thank you) The only time I ever saw my father nearly cry and leave the table, was when I bested him myself at the old age of eleven.

What is history but stories with backing and documentation. History is not without debate, along with the wish to learn more than my family, generations away from Ireland, could provide; and that my high school and college never even bothered to offer. I have to frequently remind myself that /r/IrishHistory was not created just for me!

So you may be asking what does /r/IrishHistory offer to people who aren't me? 

Plenty! Do you like your history with a side of [pop culture](http://www.reddit.com/r/IrishHistory/comments/vg6dy/mick_jagger_rare_interview_in_ireland_1965_inside/) and more than a [dash of nostalgia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IrishHistory/comments/10810x/dublin_punk_playlist_1977_1982/) How about [Ancient Mysteries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IrishHistory/comments/txc6r/tuatha_de_danann/) Do you enjoy unraveling the many [threads of connection](http://www.reddit.com/r/IrishHistory/comments/uzoir/frederick_douglasss_irish_liberty_nytimescom/) that heretofore you may never have imagined? /r/IrishHistory has all this and more.

But to get a better idea than I can provide

&gt;##1. This is more a personal question. As an American with almost all (just one French woman in the bunch) Irish heritage, how can we do better to respect Irish people and history?

&gt;&gt; **Grania17** As an American now living in Ireland I think that there is a distinct branch of Irish Americans who do bother Irish people and make me feel ashamed of being Irish. They go on and on about being Irish and yet have never been to Ireland, the best thing you can do is learn about the country, their history, their culture and respect the fact that it is different from where you live and you can't expect things to be the same. Be curious enough to see things not just go to Dublin for shopping. Go off the beaten path and experience real Ireland not tourist hotspots like Temple Bar.

&gt;&gt; **JimmyDeanKNVB** I love Irish-Americans. They are so passionate about certain things that a lot of Irish no longer care about. You'll be hard pressed to find someone under the age of 60 in Ireland who hates Dev as much as most Irish-Americans. But, I’ve met a lot of gracious Americans touring Trinity who were genuinely interested in Irish History. It’s a mixed bag, but it’s well worth talking to anyone interested in the subject.

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** Irish America is part of the Irish story too. Outside Ireland

&gt;##2. I love history

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** Maybe your dad posts here; if he doesn’t

&gt;&gt; **Jimmy** Ha, thanks in a large part to Cazale, who is one of our newer posters. And there are a few historians who lurk around, though they don’t flaunt their credentials.

&gt;##3. Are all of you Irish? Any of you historians or just love history?

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** I'm Irish and not a historian. I got the bug a few years back checking local and family history lore.

&gt;&gt; **Jimmy** I am not Irish. I am a historian - I earned my Master's Degree in Modern Irish History from Trinity College Dublin. But if I learned anything from my brief time in Trinity

&gt;&gt; **Grania** I am not Irish born but am of Irish descent. My great grandparents were born and raised in Ireland and left shortly after the Civil War. From a young age I learned my history through Irish songs - Skibbereen is still my all time favourite. As I got older and was able to understand more for myself

&gt;##4. Is there a holy grail of lost Irish history? (For me, and this one is close to my heart as it is central to one of my family's stories.)

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** For me it was [the Irish Slavery saga](http://www.reddit.com/r/IrishHistory/comments/woz7k/whats_the_story_on_irelands_17th_century_slave/)

&gt;&gt; **Jimmy** CD’s link was really good. People get very agitated when it comes to religion; throw in slavery and there will be a lot of yelling at your lectures.

&gt;&gt; Family history is tricky - it's what brings most of the Irish diaspora back to the field of Irish History. Unfortunately, which housed documents going back to the thirteenth century. That is as close to a grail as I can think of; completely unattainable, lost forever, but God what I wouldn't give to look at what was lost from the PRO.

&gt;&gt; **Grania** There is a lot of stuff coming out of the word work lately. I was lucky enough to be apart of a film for TG4 this summer

&gt;##5. In your experience

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** That the ""Gaelic"" Catholic Church had been largely independent of Rome and ""Rome rule"" is a more recent phenomena

&gt;&gt; **Jimmy** My specialty is Irish Ecclesiastical History, and the religious resurgence that Ireland undertook following the famine. Still, few people know anything beyond the basic stories of the saints.

&gt;&gt; Loyalist history is often overlooked as well - Republican history is just so much more majestic.

&gt;&gt; **Grania** I agree with JimmyDean

&gt;##6. Conversely

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** The role of native Irish nobility assimilating and successfully taking over. It is not all about the English invader.

&gt;&gt; **Jimmy** But the story of the English invader is so much easier to tell! I’ve seen a lot of inaccuracies in the telling of modern history. The Civil War. The Rising. The Anglo-Irish War. Neutrality during World War II. Much of modern history is grossly distorted thanks to movies and loud historians with dubious research techniques. Some of the most common questions I get asked about the Civil War come from what the asker took from 'When the Wind Shakes the Barley.'

&gt;&gt; **Grania** The Troubles in the North. I personally think many who lived through them don't even fully understand them. It is extremely convoluted.

&gt;##7. What would you like new subscribers to know about your sub?

&gt;&gt; **Jimmy** Don't be afraid to contribute - we love all of you and I promise you that most historians don't even know what they are doing.

&gt;&gt; **Grania** Like Jimmy said, which is wonderful. That's the whole point of the subreddit.

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** You are all wonderful.

&gt;##8. Anything you'd like to say to your current

&gt;&gt; **Jimmy** You guys rock - thanks for sticking around with us while we tried to figure out what the hell we are doing. And

&gt;&gt; **Grania** Keep on rocking lads.

&gt;&gt; **CDfm** Again

In my lifetime I have learned how to draw two things: one is a sailboat, while I just sat there drawing sailboats and pokemon. Then I overpaid on some terrible macaroni, went home, and then came to the realization that there is no god.     
      
       
      
It sucks not being able to create the images in your mind's eye. It's not that I am not creative
        
/r/ICanDrawThat is a subreddit for me. I have no talent in the drawing department
      

           
         
/u/tptbrg95/ and /u/yummyyummers/ took the time to chat with me about their subredditr/ICanDrawThat/ is a wonderful subreddit, you will get some extremely talented individuals busting their ass to make sure your ideas come to life. What's better than that? Not the Macaroni Grill. That's for sure.      
          
Seriously. That place sucks balls.



&gt;##1. What inspired you to create this subreddit?   
     
&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**: A little over a year ago
    

&gt;##2. What should people expect to find on r/ICanDrawThat?

&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**: Drawings of lots of different things.

&gt;&gt;**yummyummers**: A community of skilled and novice drawers taking requests
  
   
&gt;##3. What is the requester/artist subscriber ratio on your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**: According to stattit, it's about 1:10 artist to requester ratio. However, that's not taking into consideration all the artists that fulfill [request] posts rather that submit their own.
   

&gt;##4. How many requests would you say gets fulfilled a day?

&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**: I'm not totally sure but I just counted about 30 posts in the last 24 hours.

&gt;&gt;**yummyummers**: Depends on if there are offer requests or not. Then we might get 40+ a day
    

&gt;##5. Your favorite drawing someone has made on your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**:  /u/Delivery_of_Rule_34 made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/131n9x/request_my_dream_last_night/c704qjq) awesome picture. It's my desktop background.

&gt;&gt;**yummyummers**: My favorite drawing is the same as his.

&gt;##6. I would like a picture of my username riding a muskox into the field of battle


&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**: I'm no artist but I'm sure someone would draw that for you!

&gt;&gt;**yummyummers**: Hey make a post and see what happens! Don't forget [request] or the bot will remove it as spam

&gt;##7. Favorite part about being a moderator for this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**: The last month on this subreddit has been the best. We were fairly inactive, and the community size grew tremendously. This last month has been kind of like a rebirth for r/icandrawthat. We've added a bunch of stuff, header of the week contests, a new mod (/u/yummyummers) who added a lot of new CSS stuff, and we've gotten tons of new people. It's just been really fun to see the transformation the subreddit's had recently. Just for some context, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/0LeyT.png) the traffic stats before and after the bestof-ings.

&gt;&gt;**yummyummers**: Practicing my CSS skills! And meeting new people I wouldn't have otherwise met.

&gt;##8. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

&gt;&gt;**tptbrg95**: Consider fulfilling some request posts before submitting an offer post. I see a lot of request posts get unfulfilled. I'd like to give a huge thank you to everyone who's submitted content

&gt;&gt;**yummyummers**: Thank you to the drawers of ICanDrawThat! Being a recently new mod has really opened my eyes to how fantastic this subreddit and its subscribers are!

   
Thank you to /u/tptbrg95/ and /u/yummyummers for taking the time to chat with me about their subreddit (even though those jerks wouldn't draw me a picture)

I am one of those people.  I play the lottery.  In fact

But the thing is, too.  As a lottery’s pot increases, more people buy lottery tickets.  The odds increase that *somebody* will win – and I have just as much chance as everyone else of having that winning ticket.  But I have 0 chance of winning if I don't play.

But the most fun I have is during that time between buying the ticket and having not officially lost

/r/ifiwonthelottery is a lot more fun than I am.  This community is exactly what you think it is – it is people sharing what they would do if they win the lottery.  There’s so much wonderful stuff and houses and other things that make you wish that maybe this week

I contacted the mods of /r/ifiwonthelottery to ask them some questions

&gt;#1. What inspired the creation of this community and/or what made you decide to be a part of it?

&gt;&gt;**bangorlol** We all tend to spend a lot of time in the /*Porn/ subreddits (NaturePorn, and just kind of thought, ""This should be a thing"". The content plays off of the questions all of us asked as children - ""What if?"". What if you could fly? Where would you go? What if you could stop time? What would you do?  I've known one of the guys who created /r/IfIWonTheLottery/ for a couple of years now and worked with him on some interesting projects, but never something as community-oriented as managing a subreddit. It presented itself as a challenge and a fun project that either inspires and motivates people, or shoves them into a downward spiral of depression to know they'll never be able to afford the lavish luxuries that others can.

&gt;#2. You’ve nearly reached 10

&gt;&gt;**bangorlol** Pretty sweet, pools, and the like. I suppose my favorite thing to see on the subreddit is expensive, over the top novelties that are ridiculously impractical but so freakin' cool.

&gt;#3. Do you actually play the lottery yourselves?  Feel free to expand on the answer.

&gt;&gt;**bangorlol** I can't speak for the other two moderators, road work, etc, but it also feeds off of peoples addictions (much like reddit). To each his own, I suppose.

&gt;#4.  What is the most that anybody you know has won in the lottery?

&gt;&gt;**bangorlol** My brother found a $20 scratch ticket once. The nachos were delicious.

&gt;#5. It’s the one question that’s on everybody’s minds – what would you do if you won the lottery?

&gt;&gt;**bangorlol** I can say with 100% honesty that I'd donate a large portion if not all of it. I don't have many expenses personally and make alright money, then do something on a personal level. Donating to a charity isn't always the best idea in my opinion. I'd much rather having the money go towards infrastructure to solve long-term problems than toiletries and food for the short term.

So here's where I'm supposed to tell you about a scary encounter that happened with me, also my 5 (maybe 6) year old cousin once told me she had a dream where she was being attacked and since no one came to her rescue, she just ripped their heads off. Definitely DO NOT want to attack her ever.

I'm a big scaredy cat, like all intriguing things, I came back for more. Only to have my troll brain visualize the stories I've read the second I turned the light switch off to go to bed. 

*Sigh* Oh

*Never

*ahem* Sorry about that. Sometimes my dark passenger PariM makes a visit.

So anyway, in my opinion, make it all the more scarier. On this happy Thursday, I present to you creator of this fine sub /u/DragonShiryu2.


&gt;##1. What is /r/letsnotmeet?

&gt;&gt; It's a subreddit aimed at those people who like the types of stories on /r/nosleep but want the paranormal taken out of them


&gt;##2. Who or what decided to start it?


&gt;&gt; I was the one that decided to start it


&gt;##3. What's your 'let's not meet' story?

&gt;&gt; Actually


&gt;##4. What do you enjoy most about being a mod?

&gt;&gt; I guess it would be the ability to make the subreddit into what the readers want to see. Seeing all the visitors come by and enjoy the stories is probably what I love most about it.


&gt;##5. Any last words to your readers? (And by last words

**Disclaimer:**

Due to faith and manipulative games

We all have one thing in common: we love [police chases](http://i.imgur.com/uS8JBg3.gif). We just [can't help it](http://i.imgur.com/0NwO8sX.gif). 
Because why else do we spend [almost 8 bucks](http://i.imgur.com/blpfF.gif) for a ticket to see an action movie with police chases? Not for the story line

Some of the rotten apples will say ""but [police chases](http://i.imgur.com/Xlaasqq.gif) are not fun because that person did something wrong and explosions could do harm""-yada yada. Sometimes people need to make sacrifices

We have all seen a fictional police chase

Because how many times did you hear or see a [police car chasing](http://i.imgur.com/41Y5mMc.gif) a civil car, a solution has been delivered!
Modern technology gives you the chance to follow [these blood rushing chases](http://medias.omgif.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Romanian-police-chase.gif). Suck on that technology haters!

/r/Policechases gives you the best chases from all over the world

Soupyhands talked with moderator u/cooltom2006

&gt;#1. What kind of submission trends do you notice on r/PoliceChases
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** /r/PoliceChases is a place to submit high speed police chases

&gt;#2. What is it like moderating this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** It's pretty cool

&gt;#3. What rule do you feel is the most overlooked?
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** People sometimes submit things that aren't police chases or shoot-outs (such as x-posts from /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut) . The clue is kind of in the sub name :p Although

&gt;#4. Do you have a favourite video that you or someone else submitted?
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** No. But I have a few :d

&gt;&gt;[How they take care of hostage takers in Spain](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceChases/comments/sk8bg/how_they_take_care_of_hostage_takers_in_spain/)

&gt;&gt;[Inglewood chase Jan 13th

&gt;&gt;[Smoothest PIT manoeuvre ever](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceChases/comments/tfys5/smoothest_pit_manoeuvre_ever_also_closing_the/)

&gt;&gt;Those are my best 3.

&gt;#5. Ever had anyone submit a police chase that they were involved in themselves?
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** Not that I know of

&gt;#6. How often do you find that links have been taken down?
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** Actually

&gt;#7. How do you deal with troll comments?
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** We don't really get very many of these

&gt;#8. Any other projects you wish to promote?
&gt;&gt; **cooltom2006:** There's a couple of vaguely similar subs that are good and I recommend:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * /r/ProtectAndServe

&gt;&gt;* /r/roadcam

&gt;&gt;* /r/carcrash

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Non-related (largely unheard of) subs I think are good:

What is the internet really for? Ask a dozen people and you will get a dozen different answers. Keeping up with friends and relatives, arguing over memes in /r/Atheism. 

Today

[PrettyGirls is a venue](http://i.imgur.com/DpKyX9x.gif) by [which you may view](http://i.imgur.com/N2k7C7A.gif) and post pictures of the most [hauntingly beautiful women ever seen.](http://i.imgur.com/btMrgdl.gif) On any [given day you](http://i.imgur.com/VALqknv.gif) are sure to [find a stunning image](http://i.imgur.com/dcdF5Va.gif) which [you may gaze longingly](http://i.imgur.com/5HeAPXq.gif) at for [uninterrupted minutes](http://i.imgur.com/Mh0hNGV.gif) while your [pulse races](http://i.imgur.com/lcTbiSn.gif) and [eyes moisten](http://i.imgur.com/S4Egj46.gif) as you [thank the powers](http://i.imgur.com/fV5wjYb.gif) that be for your time upon the Earth. 

Please bear in mind this is a Safe For Work subreddit

Instead, and singers. On rare occasion you will have the fortune of one of your fellow redditors posting their own headshot, which has yielded amazing results in the past.

I spoke to some of the mods regarding this subreddit.

&gt;1) What kind of submission trends do you notice on /r/Prettygirls?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** Pictures of girls who are pretty. ;)

&gt;2) What attracts you to the difficult task of moderating /r/PrettyGirls?

&gt;&gt;**superdude4agze:** It's better than some of the no-holds-barred subs I moderate as there is something to actually watch for

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** It's not really that difficult. As a moderator

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** violentacrez modded me specifically to look out for ""sexualization of minors"" posts and comments. I felt (and still feel) that that alone is a worthy goal. But also, and having a hand in the success of the subreddit, has been a great experience.

&gt;3) What rule do you feel is the most overlooked?

&gt;&gt;**superdude4agze:** Sexualization of minors. This subreddit was created by violentacrez and some of his /r/jailbait hold outs can't seem to get with the picture that it won't be tolerated here. Others are probably just trolls or idiots and have no idea who VA was or what he did for reddit.

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** A combination of rules 5 &amp; 6:

&gt;&gt;""This subreddit is accepting of all pretty girls. No bullying, transphobia, homophobia, or otherwise negative posts please. Some polite teasing however, is always ok. :)""

&gt;&gt;AND

&gt;&gt;""Posts and comments that sexualize minors will be removed - that includes discussion of whether a girl is at the age of consent. Any girl under 18 will be considered a minor.""

&gt;&gt;If someone posts a pic of Chloë Grace Moretz with a pretty smile, nice, she's legal in my country"" type of comments. That kind of talk is removed by the mods. The point of this subreddit is to see pretty girls. Nothing sexual.

&gt;&gt;If you'd be embarrassed to show your grandmother what you are posting/saying

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** The ""safe for grandma, that's been my rule of thumb ever since.


&gt;4) Given the popularity of the sub

&gt;&gt;**superdude4agze:** It is absolutely welcomed and encouraged.

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** I think it's awesome. I always upvote self pics!

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** I'm okay with it, most abusive comments are in those posts. For some reason girls asking if they're pretty is just the worst offense. That, in turn, brings out the white knights, and the whole range of (mostly) male reaction to feminine beauty. So in one respect I want to warn a woman who posts a photo of herself because I know how it's going to go, but on the other hand the dynamic is pretty interesting to watch.

&gt;5) Your sub uses vanilla reddit css...any plans to change that?

&gt;&gt;**superdude4agze:** Thoughts of changing to full title bar with top images posted has crossed my mind

&gt;6) I frequently see troll comments when I look at the top image of the day. What do the mods thing about this?

&gt;&gt;**superdude4agze:** Trolls will always exist

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** If things get too out of line I won't hesitate to remove an inappropriate comment. One of the other mods is a lot more efficient than me when it comes to reading the comments. He knows who he is. ;)

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** Like I said the worst comments are in the self-shot posts, and the community is great about putting trolls in their place.

&gt;7) Any other projects you wish to promote?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138:** Since you asked

&gt;&gt; * /r/indie_rock

&gt;&gt; * /r/Mila_Kunis

&gt;&gt; * /r/Modern_Family

&gt;&gt; * /r/90sAlternative

&gt;&gt;**greatyellowshark:** 

&gt;&gt; * /r/BookNymphs - women and books

&gt;&gt; * /r/whoselineisitanyway - for the awesome TV show

&gt;&gt; * /r/Anger - if you're looking for help with anger management

On this day of [our Lord](http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/large_lightbox/hash/db/cf/dbcf10e8bd8d06de6ce9b81fe2e409ea.jpg?itok=zlNS5XoV), there's no definitive word as of this writing on the later. However, by the time you read this, the truth of the later rumor will probably already have been revealed, so let's not dwell on outdated speculation.

Instead

The Xbox 360 was launched in North America in November of 2005, going on to have **more than 40 million online users** (for reference, that's more than [the population of Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(graphical)). It also gave us the revolutionary [Kinect](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hjkPy2Av81w/UDB2fo-bBEI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/Js4W6sSoUX4/s1600/kinect_angle_view.jpg), an incredible motion sensor whose technology has been put to use [for far more](http://www.gizmag.com/kinect-child-hot-car-detector/27549/) [than just video games](http://www.pirobot.org/images/pi-kinect.jpg). 

/r/Xbox360 is a subreddit where actual and prospective console owners come together to share rumors (especially about [the next Xbox](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/1chkta/according_to_gamesradar_xbox_720_will_not_have/))

The /r/Xbox360 community is friendly one and is still fairly active, many of which have been from the past 3 months.

Its mods are also still very proactive, and the rules that *are* there are fairly simple (abbreviated for my fellow skim readers): 

1. Don't talk about pirating.
2. No NSFW posts.
3. No affiliate links.
4. No advertising.
5. Don't use URL shorteners.
6. Profane or racists post titles will be removed.
7. Don't discuss MS Point generators.
8. Don't beg for points. 

Just follow them and you won't have any trouble with the sub's many mods: **/u/HardwareLust**, /u/Th3Tru7h, /u/starthirteen, /u/Ali-Sama, **/u/homer2320776**, /u/glitchn, **/u/Arowin**, and /u/AutoModerator. 

The mods in bold are here today to talk to us about /r/Xbox360 and the future of the sub. Let's give them a [gamer's welcome!](http://killscreendaily.com/media/uploads/gallery_15_4_238403.gif) :)

&gt;#1. What inspired you to create r/xbox360?

&gt;&gt;**Arowin** Wasn't me

&gt;&gt;**HardwareLust** Actually

&gt;&gt;**homer2320776**HW created the subreddit

&gt;#2. Do you own an Xbox 360? If so

&gt;&gt;**sevenalive** Yes. I can't pick one favorite game, getting in the zone. After a few years I finally was able to beat my high score of 7 million. It's a hard game!

&gt;&gt;**Arowin** I own a 360

&gt;&gt;**HardwareLust** Of course I do. It's hard to pick just one. So many good games and franchises; GoW, Dishonored, Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, and all the CoD games rank right up there. If I had to pick one out of the crowd, I'd probably say Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, BF:BC2 or Halo 3.

&gt;&gt;**homer2320776**I've bought a 360 a month after launch. My favorite game has to be the original Bioshock

&gt;#3. What do you like about the Xbox360? What would you change about it?

&gt;&gt;**sevenalive**I like the new dashboard and apps. Remember when Xbox didn't have Netflix and Hulu! I really hope the new xbox has background automatic updating. Take a note from android where my apps download and update automatically without me doing a thing. It's annoying that before you play

&gt;&gt;**Arowin**  I like the simplicity of the system. I have a PS3 as well

&gt;&gt;**HardwareLust** The best thing is how the multiplayer aspect is integrated across all the various games. Cross-game chat and notifications, I wouldn't change much, although lowering the subscription cost seems to be a popular opinion with a lot of readers.

&gt;&gt;**homer2320776**The 360 is extremely user friendly with simple to use friend lists and party chat. MS has the cash to get ""most"" of the DLC first on their platform so that is usually a big plus for the majority if the AAA titles. The things I would change would be subscription cost compared to PS+
News first. Xbox points generator.

&gt;#4. Describe the r/xbox360 community in 6 words or less.

&gt;&gt;**sevenalive**Help. Fanboys. requests for gold trials.

&gt;&gt;**Arowin** ""[X] DAYS TILL THE NEW XBOX!!!!!"" 

&gt;&gt;**HardwareLust** People asking for advice and help.

&gt;#5. What are your plans for r/xbox360 once the next-gen Xbox is released?

&gt;&gt;**sevenalive**Well some us of have plans for when it's announced at E3. A few of us have been invited to go to the Xbox media briefing

&gt;&gt;**Arowin** We would love to continue moderating

&gt;&gt;**HardwareLust**  Nothing special. We'll still be here as long as there's 360 owners and users. Probably see a pretty big drop in traffic and subscribers after the next Xbox launches.

&gt;&gt;**homer2320776**Stick around and hopefully herd the traffic towards the new subreddit as the transition takes place.

&gt;#6. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**sevenalive** Thanks to those that help by reporting posts and messaging us. It really helps.

For the people who didn't understand the title
___________________

The library in our town doesn't look that special when you walk past it. Just a normal building
But when you open the doors of the library, illuminating the many books. 

But the best thing is the staircase directing you to the second floor. A huge stair which splits after the first 10 steps. Both of the remaining parts even make a little curl after that and are [rainbow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJOO7RQYPvA) coloured.

/r/Crazystairs is the home for these kind of stairs. You can walk these stairs for hours

**And they're crazy**.


But now you visit this subreddit and you notice something weird. All the posts are tagged NSFW. And then you start to wonder: Are these posts directing you to porn? Is it good porn?

[No need to worry!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1nhIVW37CM)

They are tagged NSFW because it is NSFW: [Not Safe For Walking](http://imgur.com/OikFs). 

&gt;##1. How did you came up with the idea to create /r/Crazystairs?
&gt;&gt; **greatyellowshark** /r/crazystairs was abandoned when I found it


&gt;##2. What is the definition of ""crazy stair""? 
&gt;&gt; **greatyellowshark** Any stairs that are dangerous, or interesting architecturally/aesthetically. 


&gt;##3. What is the weirdest/funniest/craziest stair you have seen?
&gt;&gt; **greatyellowshark** [The Tiger and Turtle](http://www.fubiz.net/2011/11/28/magic-moutain/) in Duisburg, and these stairs for [French-speaking cats](http://i.imgur.com/h2rtr.jpg).

&gt;&gt; **greatyellowshark** Support niche reddits! They're tough to promote and often they wither away if the mods don't keep posting. Upvoting and posting in the niche reddits you're interested in is a great way to broaden one's experience of reddit and helps to keep these communities alive. 
A new project I'm involved with is /r/obscuresubreddits, obscure) reddit. Right now we're posting the cool overlooked reddits that we know about but the goal is for it to become an established place for promotion and discovery. So - if you mod or know of an obscure reddit feel free to stop by and post about it.
And finally I'd like to thank the reddits in the /r/crazystairs sidebar for helping to promote us in one way or another - I hope everybody will take some time to check them out.

A community for **1 month** with **685 Told Miners**!

The answers the /r/YouGotTold mods gave were so long and awesome there is no room for me to say anything else

&gt;##1.What is /r/YouGotTold?

&gt;&gt; **fauxmosexual:** The internet is full of dumb people. I'm sure that 100% of people reading this will know each of you are smarter than 90% of reddit. You've all seen the dumb, the people who persist in liking things you don't like. Sometimes people will be loud and wrong and dumb all at the same time, and you itch to see someone take them down a notch. /r/yougottold is a place to get that itch scratched, to see the offensively wrong be put into their place.

&gt;&gt; **ExquisiteNeckbeard:** /r/YouGotTold is a community for people who love reddit but acknowledge that things like racism, and bad science are fairly common and need addressing. YouGotTold is all about celebrating those redditors who take the time to rebut or correct the unfortunate things people say on reddit, when so many of us might become jaded or immune.

&gt;&gt;**Dead_Rooster:** As much as we all like Reddit and most of it's users, what the fuck was that? Here we celebrate all the times when someone else comes along and rightfully puts an idiot in their place.

&gt;##2.Have you ever ""told"" someone? What happened? Were you eloquent

&gt;&gt;**fauxmosexual:** As a seasoned internet warrior I've done my share of telling. [Sometimes as a sincere explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1176wb/im_unemployed_with_no_healthcare_i_was_recently/c6k17lj?context=1)

&gt;&gt;**ExquisiteNeckbeard:** When worstanswerpossible (famous for rape/pedophilia/Hitler jokes) was at the height of his fame I got kinda sick of him and [called him out on his shitty gimmick](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sd12d/what_do_you_miss_most_about_your_childhood/c4d2w2v?context=5) (on my old account). I like to think I played some small part in him deciding to throw in the towel and give us all a break from his insightful offerings.

&gt;&gt;**Dead_Rooster:** I was drinking alone one night, my home sub where I'm a mod. I somehow managed to read the story and even into the comments without passing out and drooling on my keyboard. There I found some guy being an asshole and calling OP a babykiller, etc. Uncreative, horrible shit.
Somehow
I woke up hungover the next morning, /r/yougottold and /r/SRSWomen. I almost started selling autographs.

&gt;##3.What is your favourite example of someone being Told?

&gt;&gt;**fauxmosexual:** My favourite is [This isn't Twitter: try to comment on the article

&gt;&gt;**ExquisiteNeckbeard:** My favourite ""Told"" moment from this subreddit is probably one /u/fauxmosexual [+3] [posted recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11ke9x/what_do_you_need_to_get_off_your_chest_reddit/c6ncele?context=1). My favourite real life ""Told"" moment would be hard to pick

&gt;&gt;**HotcakesUnited:** I have kind of have a short memory span

&gt;&gt;**Dead_Rooster:** At the moment it's [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11nzr1/this_was_left_on_a_receipt_for_a_male_waiter_at/c6ok5fq?context=1). Just because I can't stand the weird sympathy that ViolentAcrez/mbrutsch is getting.  Shit makes me so fucking angry.

&gt;&gt;**TheEternalNeophyte:** My favourite instance of someone being told I've seen since this sub's inception would have to be [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10e21i/til_that_dropping_molten_glass_into_cold_water/c6cs9wn?context=10). The guy getting told was technically correct, rather than being informative, he came of as a total tool-bag. It's a good reminder that even people who are dead right occasionally need to be told.

&gt;##4.How did yougottold get started? You've got a fine healthy mod list

&gt;&gt;**fauxmosexual:** Some of us were regular commentors on /r/subredditdrama and other meta subs

&gt;&gt;**ExquisiteNeckbeard:** /u/sathion made /r/YouGotTold about nine days before I started thinking about it. I got to thinking about it quite organically; I was reading a thread in /r/linguistics where a redditor [seemed to imply that if we stop people from using ""literally"" to mean ""figuratively"" we'll have a colony on mars](http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/103lhp/xkcd_on_linguistic_presciptivism/c6a5lo7)

&gt;&gt;**HotcakesUnited:** fauxmosexual is my step-dad.

&gt;&gt;**Dead_Rooster:** /u/ExquisiteNeckbeard [+2]

&gt;&gt;**balchynz:** I got involved by riding the coattails of more successful redditors and basking in their glorious acheivements. Particularly the success and subsequent banning of /r/shitfauxmosexualhates

&gt;&gt;**sathion:** I created /r/YouGotTold/ after watching a heated debate go down in a thread as I was reading it I kept on wanting to reply with oh man you got told!
After that I figured why not make something where things like this could be posted at some point after creating it I was sent a PM by /user/ExquisiteNeckbeard asking if he could mod it and turn it into healthy sub and to his credit it has!

&gt;##5.Anything else you would like to say to your present or future subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**fauxmosexual:** Every day more and more idiots join reddit. These people and their bad opinions cannot be allowed to infect us. It is each redditor's sacred duty to seek out the dumb wherever the go

&gt;&gt;**ExquisiteNeckbeard:** Welcome aboard! We're a pretty new subreddit but I foresee a lot of excellent content and discussions in the future and we're glad to have you along for the ride.

&gt;&gt;**HotcakesUnited:** Sometimes you comes across a thread where someone is spouting ignorance, or just plain stupid. And sometimes that person gets knocked off their mountain of shit by a champion of logic. We put those champions on our shoulders, as shining examples for all to see. Bring us your heroes, Reddit.

&gt;&gt;**Dead_Rooster:** Be nice

&gt;&gt;**TheEternalNeophyte:** I've been around the internet for a while and I've crossed paths with a range of people
I'm a pretty argumentative guy, or just to learn a little more about the other side of an argument (being annoying is just gravy). You can learn a lot about a subject by arguing with someone about it, even if you are wrong.
A final point to consider is that even the most epic telling will rarely change the opinion of the tellee. The chances of someone doing an about-face after an epic telling are probably slimmer than the chances after a mediocre telling

&gt;&gt;TL;DR: a truly brilliant telling isn't about showing one person that they were wrong,False,self,t5_2sgno,1351361625.0,,WRITER,t3_126i1g

Well

Sometimes you’re in a legal bind, you know, real lawyers just don’t want to answer questions like, [“I’ve been with a gross misdemeanor.  What are my chances of having it amended to be a clean misdemeanor?”](http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskalawyer/comments/10u5jo/ive_been_charged_with_a_gross_misdemeanor_what/)

/r/shittyaskalawyer is not just for shitty lawyers, am myself a shitty lawyer.  I took one media law class and know how to search cases on Google Scholar.  “If you give out bad legal advice, you can be sued, Freakazette!”  Thank you for that advice, voice in my head, but you know what, I’ll just sue them back for being losers.  They could have searched Google Scholar themselves and they were just lazy.

So, don’t ask a real lawyer.  /r/shittyaskalawyer and get some real answers.

I sat down with the moderators of /r/shittyaskalawyer because I needed some legal advice myself.  You see

&gt;#1. Why did you feel a need to create or otherwise be a part of /r/shittyaskalawyer?

&gt;&gt;**Googunk** I created shittyaskalawyer in the earlier days of the shitty network. I spent more time than reasonably healthy on shittyaskscience and just wanted to get in on the fun. From my IRL job (airplane mechanic annual certification/training instructor

&gt;&gt;**eaglesguy96** It's a funny story about how I first got involved. I remember seeing a post about 6 months ago in one of the other shitty subreddits and there was a comment about a want for shitty law advice. I only did a quick search on the subreddits page and didn't find anything

&gt;#2. What is the best question you think has been asked on the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Googunk** If you just look at the questions

&gt;&gt;**eaglesguy96** There's a lot of funny questions that are found on the subreddit. One question that I liked and had a really good answer was the post ['i accidentally washed my wallet with my pants- how much jail time am i facing for money laundering?']( http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskalawyer/comments/xy2wz/i_accidentally_washed_my_wallet_with_my_pants_how/)

&gt;#3. Do you ever consider actually taking up law?
&gt;&gt;**Googunk** No. I did once but you know how to see a movie with a great protagonist and they convince you ""Wow

&gt;&gt;**eaglesguy96** I don't know if I would take up law. I'm still pretty young

&gt;#4. I’m being sued because somebody thought that my “legal advice” constituted actual legal advice.  Do you have any advice for what I should do?

&gt;&gt;**Googunk** Hide behind the disclaimer bro. Always point to the one little hidden line of text that says ""we're not responsible for anything

&gt;&gt;**eaglesguy96** As for your dilemma

&gt;#5. Do you have anything else you’d like to add?  I’m just seriously too lazy to come up with another question.

&gt;&gt;**eaglesguy96**  I don't have much else to add

&gt;&gt;**Googunk** Good questions? I guess... 

&gt;&gt;*who does what there?* The answer: I don't do a whole lot, but had to get help as the sub grew and I was taken on to help mod at /r/shittyAMA and in a shitty sob story I never thought possible, my application was approved to moderate /r/shittyaskscience. That help is /u/eaglesguy96 who did just about all of the aesthetics on the page, even got other redditors to make the images and it looks a hell of a lot better now. 

&gt;&gt;*""Can people send you actual legal advice if needed?""* The answer is no. It has happened a few times

&gt;&gt;*pet peeve:* the acronym IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer). Who typed that the first time and thought it was just fine the way it was? The correct acronym to use is either ""Personal Opinion

&gt;&gt;To anyone out there with shitty aspirations, and then performing an introverted circlejerk. For example: Shittysubredditoftheday is not taken. and 2. Make eaglesguy96 do everything.

1347113990.0,zk0k1,"September 8th, 2012: /r/StandUpShots. Screencaps of one-liners, because who has time to listen to a 30-second joke?",PotatoMusicBinge,181,7

A community of **3548 readers**

Gotta get something off my chest here: the title of this post was stolen. Not only did I not think it up myself

Its true origins are revealed in the interview below, lets get to it:

&gt;## What is /r/StandUpShots? 

&gt;&gt; /r/standupshots is a subreddit dedicated to quotes from comedians, just not in one place. Think of it like AdviceAnimals, except instead of an animal, it's a standup comic. And instead of a meme, it's one of their bits. What makes it unique is that the low barrier to entry means that comics themselves can submit material, and more and more are choosing to do so. Redditors get a huge source of quick laughs and original content, and comics get to tap into the best community on the internet.
While a standupshot is no substitute for live performance, facial expressions and real-time interaction - you have to get off the internet and support your local live comedy venue. Fortunately, the standupshot format features the comic's name and twitter information, so it's easy to find out when they'll be in your town. For comics, it's like a virtual business card or a free sample.
I don't think of /r/standupshots as a step down from live comedy. I think of it as a step up from image macros
The fact is, I know twitter sucks ass. You can only do short jokes. You can't easily follow a conversation. You have to type like a 13yo girl to fit within the character limit. Jokes polluted with # and @ and RT and FF and url shorters. and No upvotes and downvotes to see how people liked it. No hivemind to point out if a bit is too similar to another comic. No easy way to handle multimedia. [This](http://i.imgur.com/YnNxq.jpg) is an example of a hilarious bit that did great on /r/standupshots, and would never work on twitter.

&gt;## How did it get started? what was the spark that lit the fire of /r/standupshots in your heart?

&gt;&gt; Ironically, ended up posting [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ywvn7/the_future_of_stand_up_comedy_on_the_internet/).
I don't think it even hit the front page,000 people works for Portlandia, because the image was reposted on their Facebook page on Aug. 31. There it was liked by 1,864 people, and shared by 220 more. I have been posting my standup videos on reddit for years. Never have I had that level of success.
As a hardcore redditor, we can't lecture them about how they should appreciate the finer things in life. We have to make stupid funny pictures.
Every month

&gt;## Who are your favourite comics working the biz right now? Do you have any favorite quotes from them?

&gt;&gt; I've got too many to name, Sean Donnelly, Ryan Hamilton, Nick Turner, Mark Normand, Joe Machi, Mike Lawrence, Dustin Ybarra, Tone Bell, Tom Rhodes

&gt;## You mentioned that you yourself work in comedy

&gt;&gt; Thanks in part to this subreddit
Once comics get familiar with how reddit works, they'll go apeshit. Reddit only adopted the attention whoring, comics were born into it. Nowhere else on the internet can you get the wealth of feedback that reddit comments provide. When a comment of mine receives a massive amount of upvotes, I take it to an open mic to turn it into a fully-fledged joke. Other comics are going to discover that as well. Personally, I can't wait until the subreddit gets active enough for pun threads. Those are great writing exercises for comics.

&gt;## Any other messages for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; Reddit loves CK, I couldn't afford the web infrastructure to distribute it. As I explained in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImGoingToHellForThis/comments/zgbm2/he_has_a_point/c64ggyw?context=1), the vast majority of comics aren't paid a living wage. What works for Louis CK will not work for us. But we can afford 15 minutes with GIMP.
To comics, I would still be here all the time. I lost 20 pounds on /r/loseit. MFA got me to stop dressing like a neckbeard. Technology issues? The guy who designed it is probably on here. And if you love Jolly Ranchers, have we got a deal for you.
To other redditors, but you don't have to be a comedian to post. If you don't think the submissions are up to your standards, post some that you think are. Be the change you want to see in the subreddit. That forces us to bring our A-game. If we want reddit's respect, we should be able to go against the best of the best.
The more eyeballs we get, this one will get smarter as the population increases. Already comics are starting to compete with each other for the #1 spot, whipping out their best stuff for a chance to brag about topping their friends.
If reddit gives this even half of the support it gives AdviceAnimals

&gt;&gt;Yes

&gt;Fine.  LGBTerrific.  Why does your subreddit change so much?

&gt;&gt;I have a theory about this.  It involves the reddit-space-time continuum and karma.  Do you even know how karma works?

&gt;Sure.  Karma is based on upvotes and downvotes.

&gt;&gt;That's what *they* want you to think.

So why not remember the past

Before you say this gets boring

&gt;#1. How did you think of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**/u/One_Giant_Nostril** I was watching some movie from the early 70s and I saw one beautiful woman after another - BAM! BAM! BAM! - and I remembered how my early 'teens were filled with women who looked like them, in advertisements. I remembered my father's stack of old Playboy magazines at our cottage - this was at a time of my growing sexuality - and how those photographs informed my blossoming feelings of passion.

&gt;&gt; It may sound funny but

&gt;#2. Whats your favorite post?

&gt;&gt;**One_Giant_Nostril** [Tuesday Weld](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicScreenBeauties/comments/16tuxw/tuesday_weld/) and the not very upvoted [Susan Strasberg](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicScreenBeauties/comments/q0nqh/susan_strasberg/)... though, isn't she beautiful?

&gt;#3. Who is your favorite female heroine?

&gt;&gt;**One_Giant_Nostril** Lara Croft /r/TombRaider

&gt;#4. What makes this subreddit different from the others?

&gt;&gt;**One_Giant_Nostril** /r/ClassicScreenBeauties is not only for the classic screen sirens of yesteryear but also any handsome actors or actresses from 20s to the 70s or even 80s. Though it's not often you'll see actors as much as actresses


&gt;#5. Tell us about your community?

&gt;&gt;**One_Giant_Nostril** It's an interesting blend of people who are fans of the silent screen all the way to aficionados of 70s and 80s movies, etc. If you remember a moment when a certain actress or actor came on the screen of your TV or moviehouse and you said ""Wow!"", search them out, find a big pic of them and submit it to /r/ClassicScreenBeauties!

Today's feature interview was so rollicking and insightful

**Editor's note:** This feature was supposed to run last month. I can't begin express the depth of my own self recriminations any better so I will let mod **CirclejerkAmbassador** do it for me:

You see... I just don't know how you can fuck this one up. I thought April fools was 3 weeks ago. Apparently you didn't get the message.You see I didn't even finish High School and I could run your sub for you single handedly with that hand tied behind my back. Do you think this is some type of game? Here at /r/circlejerkcopypasta we don't fuck around and get shit straight. What are you? Some sort of Dane Cook motherfucker?! Never was or will ne funny. You're about as compitent as his jokes. Hello 1999 we want Prince and our party back


&gt;##1. What was the best thing that ever happened to you?

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT**. I would say the fact that I managed to spot the ad for this very subreddit and get the privelidge to be on this mod team so early and being able to see it grow.

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** That's a very good question but you seem a bit defensive the way you are asking it. We are very much an elite group. Best ""things"" don't happen to us because our lives are pretty much perfect. For example, completely payed off by scholarships, with the leftover money used to buy myself a luxury vehicle. My grade point average is perfect 4 point O. After I finish my dual bachelors I will be accepted straight away into the doctorate program. I will have two doctorate degree's by age twenty-five, owe zero debts, and make more money a year than you will in a lifetime. The funny thing is, this is the average CJCP mod. There are many who far surpass me.

&gt;&gt; **spoderman_tim** Being modded to ~~/r/dolan~~ here.

&gt;&gt; **sushisushisushi** Being the top surgeon at my city's general hospital, science) for saving their lives, rather than gOD. I didn't put all that work into learning science just so that some daft (that's a UK English word, but I like to use it because I'm kind of pretty worldly) idiot who worships a cloud titan could insult my reason.
Beyond that there was this one time when I won an argument on the Internet so very thoroughly that my interlocutor signed over to me his power of attorney so that I could literally prevent him from making any more illogical idiot arguments on the Internet.

&gt;##2. If there were some numerical way of comparing yourself

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT** Well I stray from following [reddiquette

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** Taking a look at [this calculation](http://i.imgur.com/Wka6a.png) for the Hitler unit (Hit) and the amount of fuel we have generated for e-arguments over Reddit

&gt;&gt; **spoderman_tim** over 9000%

&gt;&gt; **sushisushisushi** At the risk of sounding somewhat cocky, and I have had sex with females on more than one occasion.

&gt;##3. What makes /r/circlejerkcopypasta different than say /r/copypasta?

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT** /r/circlejerkcopypasta is copypasta that is reddit related and most of our copypasta comes from fellow circlejerkers

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** I mod both so I happen to be an expert on this subject! CJCP is for reddit related topics that get jerked a lot (DAE EA sucks? 420 Sweeden blazeit, ReLIEgion is literally stalling science, STEM &gt; Coffee maker degree, Neil_smoke_DeGrasse_Sagan picwithtext.jpg etc.) or aimed at specific subreddits. While /r/copypasta is a lot more general. We've all read the legendary [Shiny Pidgey story](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shiny-pidgey) and the iconic [PENGUIN OF DOOM](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/katy-t3h-pengu1n-of-d00m) but the beauty of copypasta is that it keeps on giving. Some recent examples is the now infamous [""Gorilla Warfare/Navy Seals""](http://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/16aho4/coll_gorilla_warfarenavy_seal_variations/) copypasta and [Darqwolff's manifesto.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/zge62/an_iq_test_has_shown_me_to_be_in_the_999th/)

&gt;&gt; **spoderman_tim** le bravery


&gt;&gt; **sushisushisushi** Copypasta collects pasta from all over the Internet

&gt;##4. Have you ever hit the send button and wondered if what you just wrote might end up posted here?

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT** I sometimes wonder how popular the posts will become

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** God

&gt;&gt; **spoderman_tim** yah


&gt;&gt; **sushisushisushi** In all seriousness: of course. But I've been on the Internet long enough to know that hardly anybody ever reads anything or digests anything that they do read. Getting into a serious argument with a stranger on the Internet is 9 times out of 10 less effective than getting into a drunk debate with somebody in a pub.

&gt;##5. Any tips for finding the best copypasta?

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT** Clicking the ""show top posts"" is a good way to go since reddits search function is horrible.

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** Usually

&gt;&gt; **spoderman_tim** ctrl+f


&gt;&gt; **sushisushisushi** Any subreddit where they take Reddit or things Reddit cares about really seriously. Basically, Jews, SRS, Europe, US politics, science/logic/reason, or really petty niche topics

&gt;##6. Any favorite submissions?

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT** [This man on how he loves ponies is a good one

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** [Everyone's favourite professional quote maker.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/162r6k/i_came_up_with_this_quote_just_a_few_minutes_ago/) SilenceTonight is frustrated over [BraveryJerk's silliness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/19ve7y/usilencetonights_message_to_rbraveryjerk/) /r/AndroidCirclejerk's copypasta dump also [contains some great **le gems.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/androidcirclejerk/comments/155kv0/copy_pasta_dump/?sort=new)

&gt;&gt; **spoderman_tim** Walmart.

&gt;&gt; **sushisushisushi** I'm partial to any circlejerkcopypasta that over several paragraphs claims to expose some conspiracy or another about something stupid. Usually

&gt;##7. Anything you'd like to say to present or future subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT** STRONG THEN KILL

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** Before subscribing, of your INTELLIGENCE? I wish it was because of phony gods, but I don't think they're real. What do you think?
I bet you will love the answers you get.

&gt;&gt; **spoderman_tim** ""It should be noted that in the 7th grade...""

&gt;&gt; **sushisushisushi** Have fun. Be nice. Don't be mean. We all take ourselves too seriously, can't express their opinions without being incredibly arrogant and coming off as a total dick (hence the ""circlejerk"" bit).

&gt;##8. Anything you'd like to add that I didn't cover?

&gt;&gt; **SMUT_ADDICT** I'm too unoriginal too think of anything to add.

&gt;&gt; **LiterallyKesha** I discovered that you'd never get an answer to a problem from the internet by asking. You have to troll in order for someone to help you with a problem. For example, I did what works. Trolling. By stating that Linux sucked because it was so hard to find a file compared to Windows, I got every self-described Linux Guru around the world coming to my aid. They gave me examples after examples of different ways to do it. All this in order to prove to everyone that Linux was better. So if you're starting out Linux, I advise you to use the same method as I did to get help. Start the sentence with ""Linux is gay because it can't do XXX like Windows can"". You will have PhDs running to tell you how to solve your problems. This has worked for me for the past 46 years and I can guarantee that it will work for you.

&gt;&gt;**Ragnar_OK** As a philosophy major just finishing up his undergrad degree
Everywhere I go people are having copypasta matches in this sub
YOU SHOULD NOT DOWNVOTE BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE
I'm very close to unsubscribing from this sub. I'm sick of the idiots who can't handle having their circlejerkcopypasta questioned with Nice copypaste.
An important part of being a circlejerkcopypasta'er is recognizing the pasta for what it is and to actively fight against those tendencies. In short, and ""try out"" copying and pasting other posts to get a much better grasp on what another position entails.
I would say we should remove downvotes altogether but I know that probably won't happen in this sub, with full consideration for opposing replies. The majority of people in this sub do not exemplify this attitude at all.
So, when you downvote or attack a person because they take a different position, ""Why exactly am I downvoting/attacking? Is it because my pastas are being questioned and I don't like that? Or is it because this person legitimately deserves to be silenced...?""
I'm sure most of you will dislike what I'm saying and downvote me. That's fine

Way, okay, they did but not anymore--we'll come back to this! ""Shiba"" was a Japanese word which basically just meant small dog. 

The [Shiba Inu](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rofoto/1490008414/sizes/o/in/photostream/) (柴犬) is one of the oldest dog breeds, these dogs were originally bred for to hunt and flush game. During World War II they almost went extinct because of food shortages and a distemper epidemic. Canine distemper is a viral disease which targets the lymphoid, epithelial, and nervous tissues which means it causes even more illnesses such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and hyperkeratosis (thickening of the [stratum corneum](http://i.imgur.com/Ui0w4.gif)--the outermost layer of the epidermis). It spreads by aerosol droplets and through bodily fluids. The mortality rate varies but is highest in puppies :( 

As a result all Shiba Inu today are bred from the three surviving bloodlines: the Shinshu Shiba from [Nagano Prefecture](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Map_of_Japan_with_highlight_on_20_Nagano_prefecture.svg/600px-Map_of_Japan_with_highlight_on_20_Nagano_prefecture.svg.png), territories shifted and things get renamed. There's coups, revolutions, and boundaries blur. Volcanoes and earthquakes turn words into birds.](https://soundcloud.com/the-tragically-hip/about-this-map) The Shinshu Shiba is from Shinshu which is now the Nagano prefecture, the Mino Shiba is from Mino which is now the Gifu Prefecture, and the San-in Shiba is from San-in which is now the Tottori and Shimane prefectures. All of these breeds were mixed into what is known as the modern day Shiba Inu!

&gt;##1. Why did you create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Gian_Doe I created /r/ShibaInu because I love dogs

&gt;&gt;   On the surface, videos, tips, problems, and concerns with the breed. But we realized early on, given the traffic on Reddit and potential for growth, by adding links to various Shiba rescues and shelters we had an opportunity to make a positive impact in the physical world as well as the virtual one.

&gt;##2. Do you have any Shibas of your own? PICS!?!?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Gian_Doe  I have a four year old male named Hachikō. It's a funny name but I used to have an Akita and fell in love with a famous story of an Akita named Hachikō - my Shiba Inu is named in his honor. So many pictures to choose from but sometimes the candid ones are the best so I just took a picture of him on my phone while I typed this. [He's currently curled up on the couch like a little fox](http://i.imgur.com/oTTPi.jpg).


&gt;##3. What makes the Shiba Inu so awesome?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Gian_Doe Even in the same breed dogs can be different so not every Shiba has the same traits, they're extremely clean and spend a lot of time grooming themselves (mine won't even step in puddles), very easy to potty train (some owners teach them to use a litter box), and they're highly willful which gives them a big personality.

&gt;&gt;   The willful part is also why Shibas aren't for most people, they're innately convinced they're in charge (which is hilarious). Mine reads body language better than any dog I've ever had by a long shot. This is a good thing if they're well trained but if you don't know what you're doing they'll use their intelligence and intuition to drive you crazy.


&gt;##4. Do you have a favorite Shiba picture or video?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Gian_Doe I upvote every post on /r/shiba. I love them all and feel privileged to be apart of it.

&gt;##5. Do you have anything you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Gian_Doe I've had a handful of breeds over my lifetime and the Shiba is by far the most unique. They take a lot of work and patience at first but the payoff is exponential. He's my best friend and I'm lucky to have him in my life. If you decide to get a Shiba make sure you're supremely confident in your training skills and

**6.422** people dashing through the snow for 1 year!!

**Ho
Merry Christmas everyone!**

That's right
A day full of food

Winter gives christmas it's spirit. It's like egg and bacon: an egg can still be nice without bacon

My christmas will be without the spirit though: aint no snow falling here. The pigs are all gone.

But I hope some of you can get a taste of that spirit

Yes
They call that ""The Dark Time"". **(Confession: I call it ""The Dark Time"")**

*The white snow turns into a [brown, because you know that you need to survive a whole new year.*

Except if you live in Greenland or Canada ofcourse

The winter does not only give christmas it's spirit, and ofcourse the [amazing snowman!](http://i.imgur.com/DjDC6.jpg).

/r/winterporn gives you beautiful winter pictures throughout the whole year. Here you can always find the christmas spirit. Winter is not only snow, like me.

I had an interview with moderators /u/volstedgridban

&gt;#1. What is the secret to a good ""winter-porno""? (if you'll excuse the term!)

&gt;&gt; **volstedgridban** Well, like you're getting a glimpse of another world; or (B) the kind of image where you can almost hear the muffled silence draping over everything.
[Here's an example of a good otherworldly shot](http://i.imgur.com/j6JcU.jpg). It's hard to believe that's somewhere on Earth.
[Here's an example that conveys the atmosphere](http://i.imgur.com/1cUup.jpg). You can feel the trees slowly creaking in the cold.

&gt;&gt; **soupyhands** [It should include some snow](http://klekovkin.35photo.ru/photos/20121109/433311.jpg)

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** There's no secret. You get some snow

&gt;#2. What do you like the most about snow/ice?

&gt;&gt; **volstedgridban** I grew up in a part of the world that doesn't really get winter very often. Normally it's nine months of summer and three months of slightly cold rain. Winter was something I read about in books

&gt;&gt; **soupyhands** [You can slide on it](http://i.imgur.com/SD1wJ.gif)

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** [It's so fluffy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZWwNlKn8xE)

&gt;#3. How did /r/winterporn come about?

&gt;&gt; **volstedgridban** /r/WinterPorn was created by the SFW Porn Network guys last year. They were reserving the subreddit for future development, and he gave me a chance to develop /r/WinterPorn. 

&gt;&gt; **soupyhands** /u/barney7 created it and then disappeared. Syncretic redditrequested it and we started submitting content

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** We had been kicking around the idea of a winter wonderland subreddit within the network and we saw /r/snowporn and /r/iceporn

&gt;#4. What's your favorite winter picture? Share it with us!

&gt;&gt; **soupyhands** I love the simplicity of [this one by Anita Erdmann](http://aibob.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/nationalgeographicphotocontest2011085.jpg). I love being out in the snow when everything is beautiful and quiet.

&gt;&gt; **kjoneslol** [Shirakawago covered in snow.](http://i.imgur.com/ueolw.jpg)

&gt;#5. North pole or South pole? Can you tell me why? 

&gt;&gt; **volstedgridban** South Pole. Because it's an actual continent that's just in a weird place.

**1
&amp;nbsp;    
Welcome to the Mystery ~~S~~hack!    
&amp;nbsp;    
In *Gravity Falls*, average town, complete with [giant gnomes made of many smaller gnomes](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120708212831/villains/images/5/53/688px-S1e1_gnome_monster_arms_up.png), murderous wax figures, 8-headed bears, and [copying machine clones](http://i.imgur.com/ay50Z.gif). Together, Dipper and Mabel try to uncover the mysterious truth behind Gravity Falls and their great uncle's Mystery Shack.     
&amp;nbsp;    
The series officially debuted on June 29, and [this woman](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Linda_Cardellini_Deauville_2011.jpg/220px-Linda_Cardellini_Deauville_2011.jpg). It also has a really catchy [opening theme song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tctX771EQeA) and has had many famous guest stars like Coolio, Larry King and Tara Strong (of MLP fame). In our opinion, it's one of the best cartoons out there. If you haven't seen it yet, give it a watch. If you don't have a watch to give it, you can just watch it instead.    
&amp;nbsp;    
/r/GravityFalls is a young but vibrant subreddit, [music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2XHepSadI) or [something else](http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/yt1qb/what_is_love/).    
&amp;nbsp;    
So Soupyhands and I sat down and tried to get some insight into the mindset of the mind of RainbowCrash, and their views on life. What we got was not in the least bit what we expected. Well actually it was exactly what we expected but we spruced it up a smidge to make it sound cooler.    
&amp;nbsp;    
&gt;##1. How did you get into Gravity Falls?/When did you start watching it?

&gt;&gt; **RainbowCrash** My first glance at gravity falls was when I started seeing gifs from the show, Waddles. Some of my friends were talking about the show, and there seemed to be a lot of hype around it.
Before having seen the show, and the quality pretty much floored me. After episode one, I knew it would definitely be a show I would follow.

&gt;&gt; **Paradox295** A bunch of people were talking about it on /co/ and twitter. I hadn't heard of the show until the moment it premiered

&gt;&gt; **Jtbecnel** As a bit of a cartoon fanatic- I knew the show’s creator Alex Hirsch, Tourist Trapped, and I was in love with it.

&gt;##2. Who is your favorite character and why?

&gt;&gt; **RainbowCrash** My favorite character is definitely Mabel. Her general attitude and gusto is something you see a glimmer of in a lot of children, over-the-top, super excited characters.

&gt;&gt; **Paradox295** Hmmm. It's hard to pick just one. In no particular order...

&gt;&gt;* Stan. Because he's so damn hilarious.

&gt;&gt;* Dipper. Because he reminds me of me.

&gt;&gt;* Mabel. Because, but not annoying.

&gt;&gt;* Wendy. Because she's so laid back.

&gt;&gt; **Jtbecnel** I hate to be that guy but I love them all. They’re all very tangible

&gt;##3. What is your favorite thing about Gravity Falls?

&gt;&gt; **RainbowCrash** My favorite things about Gravity Falls are the characters, and they really pulled it off well. [The intro’s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tctX771EQeA) animation and theme are just fantastic. I love the nuances in the characters. They are all really well-defined and fleshed out, and their interactions are hilarious. Mabel and Dipper really play off each other well, and make the series very enjoyable to watch. The other thing is many of the jokes or plots of the show are rather shocking. More than once have I been astonished at what they get away with. It’s always nice to be surprised in this manner.

&gt;&gt;**Paradox295** How complex it is. For example

&gt;&gt; **Jtbecnel** My favorite thing about Gravity Falls would have to be the writing- hands down. It’s funny without being cynical and that amazes me. A lot of shows take the easy way out. It’s funny to laugh at people being hurt. It’s even easier to write. With Gravity Falls all the lessons and anecdotes are sincere and beautiful and memorable and real and I think that’s very hard to establish

&gt;##4. What is your favorite thing about /r/GravityFalls?

&gt;&gt; **RainbowCrash** I like /r/gravityfalls because even with such a small userbase, and /u/Snivian_Moon making excellent gifs. There’s also /u/BlendinBlandin, who is literally predicting and referencing future episodes about timetraveling (perhaps someone who works on the show?). It reminds me of the early days of /r/mylittlepony, another subreddit I moderate. There’s a lot of passion, and a lot of cool, talented people doing neat stuff.

&gt;&gt;**Paradox295** Like other cartoon subreddits, among other things.

&gt;&gt; **Jtbecnel** The fanbase is a baby so it’s just getting its legs. /r/GravityFalls would have to be the best of the fandom. We don’t get NSFW stuff like 4chan or dumb ships like tumblr. Most of the time It’s just quality art and theories and I think that as long as it’s well maintained and filtered the best thing about it would be that it’s the best people in the fandom coming together and talk about and enjoying their favorite show.",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/zhv4j/september_7_2012_rgravityfalls_never_dont_not/

A community for **13 days** with **1218 subscribers**!

Well, and the basic staples of internet life such as cat pictures and atheism will become more and more difficult to find. We here at Subreddit of the Day are particularly concerned, as without a fresh, reliable supply of awesome new subreddits we shall surely perish. We talked long into the night to come up with a solution, and as dawn broke over the Himalayas (where our office is based) it became clear what needed to be done. For that reason I will spend the next week mining subreddit-rich asteroids in outer space and so am doing my write-up today instead of the more usual Saturday.

Luckily, gloom and gore that we put up with day in and day out. If you want a place to make you feel better about the world and the people in it, then you've come to the right place. Here is its hard-working moderator razorsheldon to give us a little more insight into the world of /r/UpliftingNews

&gt;## What inspired /r/UpliftingNews? 

&gt;&gt;  I really wasn't finding much that was dedicated to positive news. Sometimes you would see an uplifting, I became aware of /r/examplesofgood and saw their sidebar for similar subreddits, but even there I don't see any active communities that were maintaining what my vision was, hence why I think I've been able to grow so quickly.
So in a nutshell
Not two days later, so in addition to finding an online version of the story and posting the link in the comments, I added a note about my new subreddit idea. I figured one or two people might come there and post some content. Well, the next thing I knew, 200 people had subscribed, all from WTF, but I didn't have any content! So I quickly scrambled and started searching around the web trying to remember uplifting stories from the past. Once I posted a few examples, since I gather a lot of people were also seeking something like this... from all walks of life.

&gt;## What is cuter - babies or puppies?

&gt;&gt; I'm definitely a sucker for any puppy pictures/videos


&gt;## What is your favorite (or favorites!) uplifting news item?

&gt;&gt; That is a real tough question, thoughtful people in this world that are proactively willing to lend a helping hand to somebody that could use one. http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Good-Samaritans-help-man-after-tragic-loss-3572804.php

&gt;## How has the reaction been so far? Are redditors too cynical for a slice of optimism like this?

&gt;&gt; So far the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. There are countless examples of redditors coming together to help others in need

&gt;&gt; My goal was to build a community to share these stories and other examples of inspiration or compassion from the news

&gt; Who makes all these amazing gifs?

&gt;&gt;**kmp67:** We have a whole bunch of contributors with a wide range of ability; some of them are first-timers that are eager to share their first creation

&gt;&gt;**Pays4Porn :** One of the nice things about /r/upvotegifs is that Redditers are the people who make all the content. You can't pull content from other websites and post it here unaltered, and posted here. Still, the majority of the gifs are original to this reddit made and posted by their creators.

&gt;&gt;**citysnake:** Most of them are OC

&gt;&gt;**matt01ss:** As kmp67 stated, that on a site of millions of users, there are only a handful of users that are generating the vast bulk of upvote/downvote gifs used within hundreds of various subreddits. Our contributors genuinely provide a great commodity.

&gt;&gt; Last year, they have created some of the funniest and most unique upvote/downvote gifs I have seen.

Whats your favourite upvote gif so far?

&gt;&gt;**kmp67:** [Please sir... I want some more.](http://i.imgur.com/xNMwfhZ.gif) I am quite partial to [this one](http://i.imgur.com/gPa6C.jpg) too

&gt;&gt;**Pays4Porn :** [The shear technical prowess demonstrated by this gif's creator is jaw dropping. The gif is also completely awesome.](http://i.minus.com/ibmSqyKNilDCbn.gif)

&gt;&gt;**citysnake:** [This](http://i.imgur.com/RYcdv.gif) by fellow mod /u/matt01ss. Because Ip Man.

&gt;&gt;**matt01ss:** Well, it fits the situation perfectly and was done with excellent masking.

What are the /r/upvotegifs rules?

&gt;&gt;**kmp67:** Despite the name (which I improvidently chose)

&gt;&gt; We like that fact that we get mostly OC. To minimize reposts we ask that you check to see if the gif you wish to submit has been previously submitted.

&gt;&gt;More informally; we're looking for creativity... novel

&gt;&gt;**Pays4Porn :** The rules are simple and were well laid out in the other mods answers. Let me add one of the unwritten rules: reddiquette is taken seriously here

&gt;&gt;**citysnake:** Submissions have to be either upvote or downvote gifs. We wanted our subreddit to be free from requests so that it acted like a catalogue of gifs that people can also use elsewhere. We have links in the sidebar for other subreddits for request posts.

&gt;&gt;**matt01ss:** The rules are quite simple. We only allow upvote or downvote gifs with direct links. We ask users not to repost anything from the top 25 posts of all time. We only allow single gif submissions

When is an upvotegif appropriate?

&gt;&gt;**kmp67:** They're perfect for when you want to show your approval with a certain je ne sais quoi.

&gt;&gt;**Pays4Porn :** An upvotegif is appropriate in comments when it is witty, or related to the topic at hand. For example if we are talking about Matt LeBlanc [this would be a good gif to drop in.](http://i.imgur.com/BVHEI.gif)

&gt;&gt;**citysnake:** Anywhere that you feel strongly about your vote on another post. This doesn't have to be straight agreeing or disagreeing with them. [For example if you can't understand how a post or comment is so popular](http://i.imgur.com/wzyXY.gif) or [if someone posts something that makes you change your vote on them.](http://i.imgur.com/OnqPd.gif)

&gt;&gt;**matt01ss:** We've all heard the term, what about a moving picture? There is no single greater way to show your appreciation or distaste of a comment than with a perfectly relevant upvote/downvote gif. No words needed, just footage.

Any messages for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**kmp67:** Keep the good stuff coming! Your creations are what drives this subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**Pays4Porn :** Be a creator. The means of production are free

&gt;&gt;**citysnake:** Keep doing what you're doing! It's great to see the community growing and that people are giving constructive feedback on posts.

&gt;&gt;**matt01ss:** Our subscriber numbers have been growing steadily and we welcome all new users. We encourage anyone to attempt at making some gifs and allowing any type of artistic expression to be revealed. All the mods appreciate the respect that users maintain in the comments and are always looking forward to more submissions. To all of our contributors

And behold, arose from them a small group led by /u/dtox12 , who declared that the time had come for a place for weary, cynical, and ironic Christian redditors to be erected, so that they may all be gathered amongst each other.

&gt;&gt; And /u/dtox12 created /r/sidehugs that very day, cynical, and ironic Redditors - debates and arguments erupted about what was acceptable and what was not. Over a period of several months, the rules of /r/sidehugs were crafted by /u/dtox12 at the direction of the entire community as to what would be acceptable etiquette for Sidehugging one another.

&gt; What submissions do you deem most worthy of /r/sidehugs?

&gt;&gt;**dtox12:** Anything that glorifies what is right and shuns what is wrong. 

&gt; What words of comfort do you give to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**dtox12:** Sometimes, No! Mod has certainly not forsaken you. It's just, sometimes, Mod has to work (you think I get paid to be Mod? Fools!) and attend to his other obligations. I assure, however, that Mod sees all and still checks the spam filter every day.

**NO BUT SERIOUSLY??**

&gt; Is the Lord proud of his sidehuggers?

&gt;&gt;**dtox12:** /r/sidehugs has found a niche in giving people a sort-of ""humor therapy"", I think it is possible that God would be OK with that.

&gt; How many non-believers have been banned to prove the Lord is mighty yet merciful?

&gt;&gt;**dtox12:** We only ban people for spam or posting NSFW content.

&gt; The Lord seems to have inspired many rules in this subreddit...whats that all about?

&gt;&gt;**dtox12:** We've had some bumps in the road, we agreed to stop crossposting from /r/christianity as some users were feeling bullied or hurt by it.

&gt; What submissions do you deem most worthy of /r/sidehugs?

&gt;&gt;**dtox12:** The more ironic and cynical

&gt; What words of comfort do you give to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**dtox12:** Honestly, find itself liked by so many people. Remember to keep contributing and always let the moderator team know via mod mail if you have a good idea for a flair/macro/banner/etc.

For the Alien (Alien, welcome home. For those who still don't get it. LV426 is the fictional original planet where the [Xenomorphs](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-teM_165adVw/T5Tx3Nu9okI/AAAAAAAAB0c/IiENZ1Ia9RY/s1600/Alien+xenomorph.jpg) aliens first appeared in as [facehuggers](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs22/i/2007/359/c/1/Face_Hugger_by_bpsola.jpg). I'm proud to feature /r/LV426 now especially with the release of [Prometheus.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sftuxbvGwiU)

What is Prometheus you say? Only the return of Ridley Scott to the sci-fi genre after a 30 year gap. The director of one of the best Sci-fi movies of all time. OF ALL TIME. No ifs ands or buts about it. Its got an all star cast, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce &amp; Noomi Rapace. Each stealing the scene form the other every step of the way. No matter what PR guys say, Prometheus is a true prequel to Alien (the movie) if not a origin story of the Xenomorphs.

And LV426 is the best place to get your Prometheus (after watching it) related discussion on. So yeah
plan on watching Prometheus but haven't already **SPOILER ALERT** don't go to r/LV426 [right now.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxdwiOwF0VU&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=18s ""you're gonna have a bad time."") But get on it once you have. When I first watched Prometheus I didn't really have *that* many questions about it... but once I started reading everyone else's question it just [blew my mind.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=-x1YuvUQFJ0) 

~~Q &amp; A with the mods in progress

###Q &amp; A is up

&gt;1 How long have you been a fan of the Alien series. Tell me what got you hooked.

&gt;&gt;**roger_** I caught Aliens on TV in the early 90s. I was hooked because it was so intense

&gt;2 Which one is your favorite? Why?

&gt;&gt;**roger_** *Aliens*

&gt;&gt; Alien is great too, plus it really fleshed out Ripley as a character. Alien3 was a bit too gloomy for me, and I hate the way it pretty much dismissed the previous movie. It's not bad though. Resurrection was a popcorn movie; fun but not particularly memorable or well executed.

&gt;3 Ripley

&gt;&gt;**roger_** Can't comment on Shaw (haven't seen Prometheus yet!), James Cameron) totally pulled it off.

&gt;4 What is your favorite quote from the movies?

&gt;&gt;**roger_** Easy: *""Get away from her you bitch!""*

&gt;5 Alien VS Predators. Your thoughts on the matter? Canon? Abomination? Or just another pop corn flick?

&gt;&gt;**roger_** Not really canon

&gt;6 How are the fans in LV426? Rowdy or inquisitive?

&gt;&gt;**roger_** Frankly I'm amazed at how many fans we had a few months ago. I plug the subreddit like crazy

&gt;&gt; We just gained about 2

Now, so I shall try to keep this short: Dachshunds are far better than you or I could ever hope to be. Although this truth is crushing in the short term, but once accepted one can bask in the simple pleasures of man's best, most elongated friend. 

The top mod

&gt;What's your favorite trait about dachshunds? 

&gt;&gt;Sure! My favorite trait is how stubborn they are. It can not be fun to train them but their stubbornness typically puts them in funny situations that we as owners can't help but laugh at. (Same with all stubborn doggies. Hehe) But at the same time I think of dachshunds as the perfect example of mama's best friend!!

&gt;What kind of person would you recommend one to?

&gt;&gt;As with any dog

&gt;What's the most fun thing you can do with a wiener dog?

&gt;&gt;I think the cutest and most fun thing you can do with them is have them burrow. Some dogs love having blankets piled on them just to dig out

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/dachshund?

&gt;&gt;Really I just want to say thank you to all of our subscribers. When I first took over we had 75 subscribers. Our subreddit had grown because of the amazing people that are members and we appreciate them so much and subreddit of the day for giving us the recognition.!!

*If you were put on these fields without any background info, and still takes, many lives.*

History speaks of one of the biggest and cruelest wars ever fought. It takes place everywhere on the world

But what kind of war is it? Well that's a very good question. If i'm correct, and steal all their chocolate. The mudmen (humans) are defending their hilltops and their lives, and strike back. This turned into a massive war.  The rest is as confusing as the X-worldproblems Network.



In both subreddits the teams discuss the best tactics and plans to take down the enemy. It is not only a place to post pictures and videos of your team members attacking the opponents, if you are willing to find it. There is no ""good"" party, neither is there a ""bad"" one. That is up to you to decide. The only question that counts is: who will rule the world?

I visited both parties and had a little and descent talk with them.

&gt;#1. How did this war get started?
&gt;&gt; /r/enlightenedbirdmen

&gt;&gt; **MrGarrett** ALL FATHER SPOKE OF IT IN A DREAM.

&gt;&gt; **/r/madmudmen**

&gt;&gt; **duckyinahat** The war started with the creating of the/r/enlightenedbirdmen subreddit. From there


&gt;#2. What do you hate the most about the mudmen/birdmen?
&gt;&gt; /r/enlightenedbirdmen

&gt;&gt; **MrGarrett** THEIR UNONTELLIGIBLE GARBLE.

&gt;&gt; **/r/madmudmen**

&gt;&gt; **duckyinahat** We hate everything about the birdmen. They are arrogant sonsofbitches. They stole our hilltops and made us have to work together (we don't like working together). They also stole all of our chocolate in the beginning. We had to learn to cope. It was hard.

&gt;#3. There are a lot of neutrals reading this who need to pick a side. How can you convince them to join your side?
&gt;&gt; /r/enlightenedbirdmen

&gt;&gt; **MrGarrett** THE CHOCOLATE OF THE INFIDELS WILL BE SPILLED ON THE GRAVES OF THEIR CHILDREN.

&gt;&gt; **/r/madmudmen**

&gt;&gt; **duckyinahat** To all of the undecided

&gt;#4. What kind of attacks are performed by the birdmen/MudMen?
&gt;&gt; /r/enlightenedbirdmen

&gt;&gt; **MrGarrett** OURPLAN IS THAT OF AN APACHE RESISTANCE. ANY AND ALL WEARING TGE CLOTHES OF A MUD MAN WILL BE SLAUGHTERED WITH MAXIMUM PREDJUDICE.

&gt;&gt; **/r/madmudmen**

&gt;&gt; **duckyinahat** The mudmen are guerrilla warriors. We burt-burgle the bird eggs and eat them. This is a war of nutrition and of attrition. We also occasionally charge at the hilltops and take down many birdmen.

&gt;#5. Other species have joined this war too
&gt;&gt; /r/enlightenedbirdmen

&gt;&gt; **MrGarrett** IF THEY HAVE FOUND FAVOR WITH THE ALL FATHER WO ARE WE TO DENY THEM.

**55** Tile Spotters for **8 months**

You know by my name that I love small subs. Those out of the way places that give Reddit its' flavor.  Perhaps it's my temperament

I was a child of the 70s. A time when I had access to 7 T.V. channels and maybe 2 fuzzy UHF as well. Sunday afternoons were the doldrums. Stuck in between old movies and The Six Million Dollar Man

A while back I came across a little documentary on Netflix called “[Resurrect Dead](http://www.resurrectdead.com/)”

**TOYNBEE IDEA**


**IN MOVIE 2001**


**RESURRECT DEAD**


**ON PLANET JUPITER**

They began to appear in the 80s, like the mysterious “[House of Hades](http://img.groundspeak.com/waymarking/a7395e7d-bb2d-4077-a0b4-b2fa8660131e.jpg)” group, continue placing tiles to this day. A fresh one was spotted in Detroit only [days ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/toynbee/comments/1apm9n/new_toynbee_tile_found_in_detroit/)

They are quite the enigma and everything about them, some stretching into the realm of [conspiracy theory.](http://www.resurrectdead.com/picture/philly_16th_chestnut.jpg?pictureId=10645065&amp;asGalleryImage=true) That's all we really know. So when I happened upon this little subreddit deddicated to capturing Toynbee Tiles in the wild I was intrigued. Let's talk to its creator about this mystery.

&gt;## 1. How did you stumble upon Toynbee Tiles?

&gt;## 2. What motivated you to start this subreddit? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/CivAndTrees** 1 &amp; 2. I first stumbled upon toynbee tiles on a visit senior year of high school to NYC. However

&gt;## 3. Do you have any in your city? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/CivAndTrees** Yes I do, the city paved over two of them. The one on 8th and market is the last tile in STL. And to be honest, its not in good shape. 

&gt;## 4. Do you have a theory about the tiles meanings? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/CivAndTrees** This is what most people can't seem to figure out. The tiles are very precisely done and you can tell for the most part they were done by the same person/thing :) The documentary tries to follow a theory about Philadelphia resident Severino ""Sevy"" Verna, the [manifesto tile](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/56635556@N00/215822355/) from 16th and Chestnut , Philadelphia. The tile screams of a conspiracy of ""Sevy's"" life. Something in his life led him to do this. That's what I want to know. My crazy theory: Sevy was a time traveler and came to warn us of the ""hellions"" while telling us the secret to having paradise in the universe ""resurrect the dead on Jupiter"". We find out the secret by collecting all the tiles and putting them together, like a puzzle. Crazy, I know, but just a different theory to explore. 

&gt;## 5. What are your hopes for this little sub? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/CivAndTrees** Basically

&gt;## 6. Anything else you would like to add for subscribers or first time ""tilers""? 

&gt;&gt; **/u/CivAndTrees** If you haven't seen “Resurrect Dead” I would highly suggest watching it to get a background of toynbee tiles and the general theory of Sevy Verna. If you have pictures (good or bad quality) of any tiles you have seen, please, post them here with your city! 

There you go folks, they don't [last forever](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-17cdWThIZ-g/TtOHr9SnBFI/AAAAAAAAAMo/etQAPBDdKKU/s1600/Decaying-Tile.gif)). Some people even seem to be [collecting them](http://hiddencityphila.org/2012/09/value-in-toynbee-tiles-art-thieves-think-so/).

Let me begin by saying

When /r/MetaCanada was first introduced to me, ""hmmm another circlejerk for another country? Meh. Whatevs. Seen one, seen them all right?"" So I forgot about it. Then a few hours later... we got another PM, then another, and another and then some more. I like to mention, that as the present administrator of /r/SROTD this pisses me off to no end. When we get spammed. So now /r/metaCanada was getting on my nerves. But I forgot about it again since none of the other mods or I were willing to feature them at that point. Fast forward a few days later and we are still getting sporadic PMs **demanding** we feature /r/MetaCanada. The nerve of these clowns. 

I, I came up with an idea. I would live amongst them and learn their ways and become part of their community (at least for a few days)... sorta like [Dian Fossey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dian_Fossey) but with silly Canadians. 

As you can see from my [comments in that subreddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/search?q=jaxspider&amp;restrict_sr=on) I was having a blast on their behalf. And nothing negative really happened... except for some jimmies being rustled. But that can be forgiven right? RIGHT?

Anyway, this sub is for you. If you want to see a community that is basically chaotic good, this subreddit is for you. If you want to make silly macros of the queen, this subreddit is for you. Even if you aren't Canadian like me, this subreddit could be for you. I mean who doesn't like [Poutine](https://www.google.com/search?q=Poutine&amp;aq=f&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod%3D0&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=rJCNUPicGs3O0QHsw4HgBA&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950&amp;sei=rpCNUL7pGo270AGIj4DgDQ)? Hitler-Harper thats who. 

~~**Interview with the mods will happen... once they realize they've been featured.**~~


&gt;1 Why is /r/MetaCanada the way it is? Apology accepted.

&gt;&gt;**barosa** Metacanada started off as a place for me to make /r/circlejerk posts specifically to mock the /r/canada hivemind, and not remove any posts or comments, because it's just more fun that way. So I let the users post whatever they want, be it shamelessly mocking people, having serious conversations, or going overboard in fighting with mods to be featured on their subs without having any good reason to do so. We have quite a few dedicated users who do most of their posting in metacanada, so there's usually something interesting going on.

&gt;&gt; A lot of what makes metacanada fun is the large assortment of in-thread memes and CSS styling, but I take the internet way too seriously to just give it up like that.

&gt;&gt;Apology not delivered

&gt;&gt;**toughitoutcupcake** MetaCanada is a direct response to the circlejerky fervor that /r/Canada frequently works itself into. Some people don't see the humour in what we do

&gt;2 If you could change one thing about /r/MetaCanada what would it be?

&gt;&gt;**barosa** I think we should try to get worked up about internet posts a little bit more

&gt;&gt;**toughitoutcupcake** There is a lot of lulz

&gt;3 Whats your favorite post from the last month? why? That's like asking me to pick which of my non-existent children is my favourite! They are all my favourites.

&gt;&gt;**barosa** [**Probably this one**](http://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/comments/12172t/final_srotd_status_for_rmetacanada/) because I love the internet drama. This feature is our greatest conquest since the war of 2012.

&gt;&gt;**toughitoutcupcake**

&gt;4 If jimmies could be rustled and they were

&gt;&gt;**barosa** If your denying us SROTD for so long was just a ruse to rustle some jimmies, I usually just get into another internet argument until I forget all about it.

&gt;&gt;**toughitoutcupcake** Not that my jimmies cannot be rustled as they are unrustleable. In general

&gt;5 Are Terence &amp; Philip really a proper representation of the average Canadian or is it systematic propaganda to make America hate/love Canada?

&gt;&gt;**barosa** Did you just say that you hate Terrance &amp; Phillip? I'm a lot more like Scott; [**This clip**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1xedaZRoh8) is exactly what happens when I post an opposing opinion in an /r/canada thread.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, we take pride in putting gravy on french fries, and in having certain flavours of potato chips which are not available in some other countries. We also like to add vowels to words like ""flavour"" and get our jimmies rustled when someone tells us we spelled it wrong.",,False,self,t5_2sgno,,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/128ff8/october_28_2012_rmetacanada_this_subreddit_isnt/

I'm fortunate enough to take 3 hour classes. They're **so** much fun. Usually I can pay attention for about an hour. Then it's a steep downwards slope and I spend the last hour and a half of class day dreaming. Usually I think of disasters.

What if people from the CDC stormed my classroom in hazmat suits and told us we're all being quarantined because someone in this room is the carrier of an extremely rare recessive gene that can only be passed one by his/her hair. If you touch their hair

Or

Wait...these aren't crazy. They're psychotic.

Usually my crazy ideas come to me in dreams. A few nights ago I had a dream that people were able to stretch their legs so that they can become really tall and just walk everywhere.

Everybody walking everywhere. That's a crazy idea

So

I can't explain the subreddit. You're just going to have to experience it yourself.

&gt;##1. How in the hell did this subreddit start?

&gt;&gt;**Pravusmentis**I obtained it from /r/subredditrequests. I am not the creator so I don't know the original intent.

&gt;&gt;**ToastyRaichu**I also hd the idea to start this subreddit

&gt;##2.  Where did this idea of ""hey let's all share ridiculously crazy ideas"" come from?

&gt;&gt;**Pravusmentis** ~~~Originally I had intended to write a new post everyday which talked about a crazy things that had happened to me since no one around here (my locality) seems to believe that in most of the things we did back where I was from (I have many a good story). However I got lazy and with /r/crazystories being for just that purpose I did nothing.~~

&gt;&gt;I have found why I wanted this subreddit. Here it is: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b2z7p/anyone_have_any_theories_they_wanna_run_by/), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ewp12/anyone_have_any_ideas_or_theories_they_wanna_run/), [6](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i4uyv/what_are_some_cool_home_remedies_that_you_know/), [7](http://www.reddit.com/r/projectreddit).

&gt;&gt;Minus the last one these are the posts that lead me to want this subreddit to be like those posts. Then someone messaged me and asked if they could do things with the sub and I modded them and now

&gt;&gt;**ToastyRaichu**Paradoxically

&gt;##3. Do you use the help of drugs/alcohol/sugar to come up with your ideas?

&gt;&gt;**Pravusmentis**Well I brew beer so yes. Also yes.

&gt;&gt;**ToastyRaichu**I do not.

&gt;##4. Give me *your* craziest idea.

&gt;&gt;**Pravusmentis**Oh. There are so many ideas, read through those # posts for some good ones though.

&gt;&gt;**ToastyRaichu**We clone the greatest doctor/caligraphist/guitar player's hands and surgically replace everyone's hands with them. Everyone now has precise

&gt;##5. How do you keep your subreddit active?

&gt;&gt;**Pravusmentis**I have no idea

&gt;&gt;**ToastyRaichu**People like discussing other people's insane ideas. It's good for passing time and its very entertaining

&gt;##6. How do you feel about pellets that can be shot into the ocean that will make a small circle of water instantly freeze? (It would suck if you were in the water and a pellet was shot in your vicinity and you were stuck in ice)

&gt;&gt;**Pravusmentis**well as I would like to consider myself a scientist I would feel very intrigued about said idea, but I could go on all day like this.

&gt;&gt;**ToastyRaichu**Genius. We could make bridges across the oceans with this. We'll just need to super size it

&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;**Pravusmentis**yes

Go submit your crazy ideas. Everyone has them.

Welcome friends and family, or maybe you're the cast of Friends and you're at home waiting for the phone to ring.  Whatever the case may be, somehow you made it to our front door.

I spent the day thinking about approaching the idea of cool, the idea of cool has always been one or two steps ahead of the masses.  (I was going to reference a longer time period, but let's face it, pre-industrial revolution folks had no time for cool).  (Parenthetically speaking, of course).  So everyone's got time on their hands and they're now concerned with style, with taste, the confidence with which you handle yourself and a few other qualities.  Some folks are sticking out as doing ""it"" better than others and viola, not so fast Madonna.  Everyone's copying your hairy sausage wallet so get your ass into some neon and start wearing odd fitting garments.

Here to fully explain how this place works is my newest best friend, he's more wemaverage or wemsevenoutoften.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;Our tagline is “history’s cool kids, description is that it’s totally subjective. One person’s cool is another person’s fool, which means we get everything from great uncles hanging out in front of F-104 Starfighters, to Raquel Welch flaunting her oh-so-fine bosom. Nowhere on planet Reddit, will you find such a wide variety of coolness on one page. 

&gt;&gt;Why do we need such a subreddit? Not to wallow like hipsters in nostalgic

&gt;Okay

&gt;&gt;That’s a great question. If by good you mean loads of karma love, surprise get a lot of upvotes. But, every single day, something amazing crops up. Our most popular ever subs have been a saucy Fifties matinee idol, a dude skateboarding in a suit and trilby and a French partisan looking dapper as fuck, while waiting to machine gun Nazis, closely followed by someone's Dad wearing shades and white flares chillin’ next to his Trans Am. So

&gt;You had some incredible attention early on

&gt;&gt;Yeah, we’re one of the fastest, if not the fastest growing reddit in town. Currently we sit just beneath socialism and redheads, (there’s a gag there somewhere), and while they’re 3 and 4 years old, we’ve only been going for three months. We had a couple xposts on pics early on, mainly semi naked OldSchoolCool girls, to the extent that after a month or so [we got blogs writing about us.](http://www.visualnews.com/2012/06/06/rockin-reddits-old-school-cool/)

&gt;&gt;I think there’s a few reasons why we’re still growing so quick. Firstly, when you post something you’re pretty much guaranteed some love. OldSchoolCool is one of those reddits where people dish out upvotes out like candy. It’s a feel good reddit. Finally, there’s nowhere else on reddit a picture of your granddad will be so easily sandwiched between Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot

&gt;Is there a modern day equivalent to oldschoolcool content? Why only focus on oldschool? What do you have against technology and modern life?!

&gt;&gt;No, open a magazine, it’s right in your face. OldSchoolCool isn’t about being anti modern or anti technology. I mean we’re all redditors so, even if we love checking out the past, we’re still spending way too much time long online. It’s more about celebrating the past in a different way and showing how true coolness is timeless, a state of mind, rather than what brand of trainers you wear or how much “swag” you have.

&gt;Last paragraph is yours - please take the mic and say something cool.

&gt;&gt;First off

&gt;&gt;Hopefully, just as long as you’re happy with flowers (and headbands) in your hair!

For the life of me, and I'm not concerned about this at all.

I'd like to think that I have a crack team of microscopic guys in lab coats working all the time, evaluating what must get deleted.

Today at Subreddit of the Day,388 subscribers can't be wrong!!  Over 100 posts each day, tons of activity in the comment section, questions, answers, and oh how everyone loves the photos of your bike!  It's THE place for cycling enthusiasts, fanciers, the posters, we thank you and we recognize you as today's Subreddit of the Day!

Here to participate in an interview are the **entire** /r/bicycling mod team.  Many thanks to FountainsofDave, aggieotis, stereo, and bicycling_community.  Harry, no_numbers_here, you are missed.  Although we never met, I dedicate this post to you and promise that the next time I see the sun I shall think of you, shine on.

&gt; /r/bicycling is todays SOTD because you help make reddit.com awesome.  Please explain to us how you feel /r/bicycling makes reddit better.

&gt;&gt;/r/bicycling is a fairly large niche subreddit, to [commute](http://redd.it/ojatk), or just climb hills for fun, you can [get advice](http://redd.it/tep23), support, share the latest bicycling news, or just chat for fun. For immediate answers or to socialize

&gt;What are you most proud of when you think about /r/bicycling? What would you change?

&gt;&gt;We are most proud of our &gt;43, helpful and putting a good face on bicycling in general. We created the chatroom in November to celebrate 25,000 subscribers and wouldn't have achieved such spectacular growth without our amazing community.

&gt;&gt;We're on our third run of reddit branded bicycling gear, so [sign up to be notified](https://groups.google.com/group/reddit-jersey-announce?pli=1)!

&gt;&gt;If there's something we'd change -- it'd be that people spend less time on /r/bicycling and more time on their bicycles. ;)

&gt;I'd like to ask about Harry Delmolino

&gt;&gt;Harry Delmolino, May 22nd.](http://redd.it/u1rc3) due to injuries received in a bicycle accident. He loved to share his unique passion for bicycling with everyone in his life, and the community of /r/bicycling in particular, where he was a major contributor and moderator. Additionally, he created the reddit bicycling chatroom and helped it grow to an active real-time chat where people could seek advice and discussion about everything bicycle-related. Anyone who needed help with anything could always count on Harry's kindness, experience and patience. He inspired many with his love for cycling. We miss you, Harry.

*Terrick Riverson stood in the cellar of the house of a cultist

*A false god at best

*This was his house, but first corrupt, the woman who was now his wife. The woman who was his love.*

*He was simmering with anger at the sight of the secret door

*Footsteps. He nearly drew his mighty two-handed warhammer at the sound

*Faye reached the end of the steep stairway. A lone torch he'd recently lit, as he'd told her so many times. Why she wore it now, he wasn't sure. Why she'd asked him to fetch one of their finest bottles of wine, too, he could not imagine. There was no special occasion tonight.*

*Except that the snow was now thick on the streets of Grundikurn. A blessing from R’rpgee

*""Come, showing his teeth. ""I'm merely looking for the..."" His voice trailed off, and his expression went blank as his eyes caught sight of the broken shards of glass in his hand.*

*She walked to him, on the hilt of his mighty warhammer. Embarrassed, he let both his arms fall to his sides. He felt unsure of his thoughts, and knew it showed on his face. She just smiled at his expression. ""My great hero,"" she said, ""you needn't explain yourself. It's just, I was worried.""*

*""Worried?"" he said.*

*Her expression grew concerned

*An hour! Terrick thought. Stunned

*""Tell me what you've been doing down here all this time

*""I... I...

*Could she be lying? Anger filled his belly. He wanted to lash out and smash more of the bottles of fine wine that filled the cellar

*Dropping to his knees, there could be no doubt. ""The blessings of Reddit weren't enough. I... when I'm down here, I just know. I know, there is evil here, and the gods have cursed us for living here, and R’rpgee has cursed me most of all for not fighting harder...""*

*He accepted his lovely bride's kisses, he thought. What kind of man wears mail in his own home, under his own roof?*

*Yet, she was still smiling and had a fiery glow in her eyes.*

*""What is it?"" he asked

*She started to speak, but only for a moment. Why was she still in such good spirits? He began to wonder...*

*""FAYE!"" he said, trying to lure him back to her old god, the one who was supposedly above all the others, the incomprehensible one named Reddit?*

*Was it possible she had lied about her conversion to R’rpgee?*

*”Which god do you truly serve?” he heard himself asking.*

*She blinked at him. “The true god

*His paranoia ramped up. Why not speak his holy name?*

**”Say his name!” he hissed.**

*”R’rpgee

*She touched his hand. “So saith the Tomb of R’rpgree.”*

*Terrick began to sob. “Yes,” he said. “You are true to the faith. I shan’t doubt you again.”*

*”Good

*”Yes

*He watched her procure a bottle of wine from the cellar. She held it up in the flickering torchlight and said

*”Indeed, it will receive many an upvote from the congregation tonight.”*

In case what is easily the strangest writeup I’ve done so far for /r/SROTD doesn’t make it obvious, yellowking, and tekhammer. Below is the transcript.

***

&gt;Role-playing games with... *pencils and funny looking dice*? Holy gods

&gt;&gt;**rednightmare**: Well, gasp, participating in a live action game are completely different experiences from video games like WoW. Role playing games are about creating your own mythology with your friends. It's equal parts gaming, improvisation, and storytelling. It's about collaborative imagining and it's about letting loose for a few hours each week and being whatever you want to be.

&gt;Tell me about your favorite RPG character ever. System, background? Was it your character, one you DM'd for, or what?

&gt;&gt;**rednightmare**: My favourite Non-Player Character was an old charlatan known as Lord Ramshackle. He was the unofficial king of thieves

&gt;&gt;I could never pick a favourite character that I played

&gt;How do you account for the fact that despite its huge growth /r/rpg remains such a great place on reddit to discuss all things RPG related? I would think that by now

&gt;&gt;**rednightmare**: Our subscribers do a really good job of policing themselves and our moderation team is quick to step in and remove things that don't belong in r/RPG. What I really think it comes down to is that role players have respect for the community. We have a very friendly subreddit that is helpful and polite. I really think that our subscribers and submitters realize that and want to preserve it.

&gt;What are your favorite types of posts on /r/rpg? Links to articles, or something else?

&gt;&gt;**rednightmare**: The posts that I most enjoy seeing in /r/rpg are when someone makes a self post saying how much they enjoyed their first time role playing. There's nothing I like seeing more than someone having a positive first time with our hobby. I like them even more when they thank /r/rpg for helping them get into the hobby.

&gt;Let's discuss your favorite DM (i.e. gamemaster, whatever you call them). Why did he or she rule so much? Any anecdotes you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;**rednightmare**: My favourite GM will always be my first GM. I have him to thank for introducing me to RPGs and all of the wonderful people I've met since I started playing.

&gt;If you had one piece of advice to give to all newcomers to /r/RPG

&gt;&gt;**rednightmare**: If you're new to RPGs then don't be shy. If you have questions or need help then ask away. If you're not new then please jump in and start sharing. We like all RPGs and story-games

 You know by my name that I love small subs. Those out of the way places that give Reddit its flavor. Usually

If you're not familiar with /r/progresspics let me catch you up to speed. This sub is dedicated to before and after pictures of body transformation. For the most part weight loss but not exclusively. Whatever your fitness goals this is the place to post those awesome before/after pictures of yours. There is only one rule to posting and it is this (from the sidebar) -

&gt;Use this format when posting pictures to help everyone understand the transformation and journey you have been on:

&gt;Gender/Age/Height [Weight Before &gt; Weight After = Total Amount Lost] (Time period in months) Personal title

&gt;EXAMPLE: F/23/5'5"" [189lbs &gt; 169lbs = 20lbs] (4 months) Been lurking for a while

When I first learned of /r/SubredditOfTheDay

So let's hear from those dedicated mods who bring you the success stories that keep you motivated.


&gt;## 1. How did this sub get started? What inspired you to put it together?


&gt;&gt; **/u/xtc46** : It started as a spinoff of /r/loseit (same set of moderators run both) and a place to put and collect pictures of the transformations 

&gt;&gt; **/u/beefwich** : /r/Loseit, we wanted one simple repository for all the amazing photos. Eventually we split it like this: weightloss/progresspics in /r/Loseit must be accompanied by a small blurb of text telling users how you lost the weight. /r/progresspics doesnt have this rule. 

&gt;## 2. How would you describe your community?


&gt;&gt; **/u/xtc46** : Diverse

&gt;&gt; **/u/beefwich** : Uplifting. Affirming. Inspiring. It's my go to whenever I need a pick-me-up or when I'm stuck in a rut with my own weight loss journey. 


&gt;## 3. Do you have a transformation story? Pics or it didn't happen!


&gt;&gt; **/u/xtc46** : I do

&gt;&gt; **/u/beefwich** : Sure! I just lost my 200th pound-- somewhere over 430 to 230. [Check it.](http://i.imgur.com/os3UwCN.jpg ) 


&gt;## 4. I noticed that your sidebar is free from links to other weightloss/fitness subs. Why is that?


&gt;&gt; **/u/xtc46** : No real reason. We just haven't added any.

&gt;&gt; **/u/beefwich** : We'll vet other weight loss and fitness subs and put them in the sidebar on /r/loseit. 


&gt;## 5. What transformation has been your favorite?


&gt;&gt; **/u/xtc46** : No one in particular. Some of the other mods may have one. I don't really find transformation pics that important for myself

&gt;&gt; **/u/beefwich** : Here's the *type* of transformation I like: when the after picture looks 10 years younger than the before picture. It never ceases to amaze me how much being overweight ages you. I see some old pictures of myself and I look like I'm fifty years old. It's unreal. 


&gt;## 6. Anything else you would like to add for subscribers or hopeful transformers? 


&gt;&gt; **/u/xtc46** : Start right now. I think one of the biggest mistakes people make is that they say ""Ill start tomorrow"" or ""Ill start right after the candy bar"". Start right now.

&gt;&gt; **/u/beefwich** : You have so much capability and power within you that it's almost unbelievable. The moment you start taking steps to tap that power


So there you have it.

One sub dedicated to showcasing the possible. If you could use a little inspiration/motivation in your day, spread the love and let others know about this sub (in a nice way). For those who have posted, congratulations on your success.


It's been my [pleasure](http://i.imgur.com/awToY0R.gif) and

P.S. Because I didn't get the questions out early enough not all of the Mods had a chance to answer. I will add their answers as they come in

Before you enter this world full of blueberries, and a pretty damn good one.

I'll put here a show summary from /r/Psych:

&gt;Shawn Spencer has developed a keen eye for detail after being instructed by his police officer father to note even the most minute details of his surroundings. After conning the police into believing that he's a psychic

So dont worry if you dont get some paragraphs of the write-up (almkst every sentence is a Psych or 80's movie  references)


Let me begin with saying that /u/Freakazette and [I are](http://i.imgur.com/1sQV5.gif) [HUGE](http://i.imgur.com/BziHxCk.jpg) [fans of](http://i.imgur.com/1sQV5.gif) Psych. There is a great possibility we will put a lot of [Psych refereneces](http://i.imgur.com/gK6okzd.jpg) from now on in SROTD's mod mail. The other mods probably won't notice it

Psych is [as addictive as Scrubs](http://i.imgur.com/B8aTwoq.gif), Shawn and Gus are more like a married couple. The married couple who argue all the time but still love each other. 

I have actually faked some psychic visions with strangers (*looks nonchalant at his fingernails*). I do not only collect spores, assuming that their pants aren't on fire. 
So

But these are only far-fetched ideas

Example? *Well tell 'em a story
I went camping once. My friends found me curled up in my sleeping bag because a racoon was hunting me. No, but the life of a repo man is intense. 

And I know it's pathetic, I've got hundreds of people dying to abuse me.


But lets jump to the [interview](http://i.imgur.com/5enVlxY.png)!


##Hopefully I will get more answers soon!


&gt;#1. How did you get into Psych
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** It was just on one day, so I added it to my DVR and since then I've been a fan.

&gt;#3. What does this subreddit provide?
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** Psych gets bounced around a lot and for some reason the seasons and when they air are unpredictable. It's a good place to actually follow what's going on with all of that. Between seasons we post funny clips and quotes to remind us why we love the show. 

&gt;#4. Whats your favourite nickname for Gus?
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** I'm pretty sure this subreddit has decided [""MC Clap Yo Handz""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16VrqUEdyTE) is the best. It's usually at the top of the ""best Gus nickames"" posts.

&gt;#5. Who is you favourite character? And why?
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** I couldn't pick a favorite. They all play a part

&gt;#6.Did you ever had a ""psychic"" vision? How did it go and did anyone believe you?
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** You mean have I been really perceptive of things around me then tricked my coworkers into thinking I was psychic? I wish I could do that.

&gt;#6. Do you own a blue berry
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** Haha nope

&gt;#7. What is your favorite episode/clip?
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** The 70s episode was especially hilarious.

&gt;#8. What do you think about the new season so far?
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** It's a little more serious, so that's fun.

&gt;#9. How is the community? 
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** The community is great. Unlike most subreddits

&gt;#9. Anything else you'd like to add?
&gt;&gt; **oddmanout** An interesting bit of history... we took this subreddit over. It was originally a psychology subreddit, who is an awesome guy, just let it get turned into the TV show subreddit. 

I hope you enjoyed it! And you know

""Holy hell

Oh no, /r/OneParagraph is a writing community for those interested in both the challenge of restricting a tale to just... you guessed it, one paragraph, and actual challenges that the mods host. If you manage to conquer both, you get a [*prize*](http://school.discoveryeducation.com/clipart/images/big-prize-color.gif) for it (see more below) and the satisfaction of knowing that you are now king of the sub! Well, maybe not the last part, but don't let that deter you. OneParagraph is just an awesome little writing community.

And for the record, look! [A bird!](http://www.kilchi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/add-bird.jpg)

Today we have two of the sub's mods

&gt;1.What inspired you all to revamp this subreddit and why did it die in the first place?

&gt;&gt;**Jmn357:** I don't think it died

&gt;&gt;I think flash fiction is an important tool for writers at all levels, but the total aesthetic revamp was something I thought the sub needed and I'm really happy lucidenigma (and his roommate) were able to pull it off so well.

&gt;&gt;**Lucidenigma:** I wouldn't say the sub died

&gt;2.Are any kind of fiction pieces allowed (i.e. fan fiction) or do submissions have to be 100% original?

&gt;&gt;**Jmn357:** Would I remove fan fiction from the site? No, set scenes, and remove the excess that plagues a lot of newbie writers. Haruki Murakami would probably make the apt comparison that it's like how marathon runners also run sprints. 

&gt;&gt;**Lucidenigma:** Originality is key. Flash Fiction should be written such that the reader can walk into the story with no prior knowledge and walk out the other side with a novel grasp on an interesting concept or situation. That's what makes it so entertaining. It's like taking shots of prose...all the bang

&gt;3.One paragraph doesn't seem like a lot of space to tell a story. What are some tips for someone interested in writing such compact fiction

&gt;&gt;**Jmn357:** My advice on telling a story in one paragraph? I think where most people fail is that they think it takes more than necessary to explain something. It's hard for me to explain the process to someone without knowing how they write. For me? I want to show a slice of existence as simply as possible. Simplicity though, but I just dont think anyone will read it. The point is for us to get better at using less. Literary minimalism if you will.

&gt;&gt;**Lucidenigma:** When I write flash fiction I try not to think about having to tell a story. Instead, or how you felt when your dog died. Those are stories. As for length, I recommend writers remember the nature of the sub. People don't come to a place called ""one paragraph"" to read a few pages, or even a single page. So as a mod, I'm not going to take down a long post, but I can't guarantee anyone is going to read it either.


&gt;4.I see that you guys hold a weekly writing challenge. Can you tell me a little more about it and is there a prize of some sort for the winner?

&gt;&gt;**Jmn357:** lucidenimga handles the prize end of it. The writing contests are a callback to what first got me into the sub. The previous mods used to do these every week, sometimes specific, sometimes really left field. It's been a lot of experimenting so far that correlates with how much red wine I've had Sunday night with dinner. I think I'm getting a better idea of what pokes people in the right way though.

&gt;&gt;**Lucidenigma:** jmn357 heads up the competitions, but you get to show off to other writers in the sub and draw a little more attention to your posts.

&gt;5.What's your favorite OneParagraph submission?

&gt;&gt;**Jmn357:** I can't pick one to be honest. What I like is when I see a writer develop. If I had to pick one I like a lot (not necessarily the ""best"" or my ""favorite"" or anything like that) I would go with this recent submission. Why I like it so much is because when I first read it I had a physical reaction to it. I literally sat back in my chair and said ""Fuck

&gt;&gt;**Lucidenigma:** This is much like picking my favorite book. It highly depends on my mood

&gt;6.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Jmn357:** Submit! I'm very much of the Ira Glass school of getting good at something. Look, in fact, you probably write yourself. The next step is putting your stuff out there, because otherwise you don't get better. No one is born a good writer, like any other craft you get good by learning, making mistakes, and putting your work out there so you can see what sticks to the wall. Picasso didn't start a cubist.

&gt;&gt;**Lucidenigma:** Please don't feel intimidated to submit. No one is going to yell at you for writing something they don't like. Literature is like food: everyone has their own unique taste and though there are some popular dishes, remember their first girlfriend or boyfriend, recall the texture of seashells, or shed a tear for heartache. In 30 seconds. I mean, how cool is that? So much power in so few words.

Reddit was free from know the horrors about the wars between [r/pickle](http://www.reddit.com/r/pickle) and [r/banana](http://www.reddit.com/r/banana). We were all happy in our own little corners browsing our favorite subs. Little did we know that Sid would start a new battle. **The Battle of Subreddit of the Day!** 

...or at least he would try. My comrades at r/banana decided to take the high road and not engage in such foolish tactics. They decided to answer questions about their subreddit and refused to answer any questions about the war. Unfortunately

[...on both sides.](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs19/i/2007/285/6/d/Banana_kill_02_by_RosaFluffboll.jpg)

The battle will cease for a day so r/banana can have a proper conversation about their kingdom. Gather 'round pickles. We mean you no harm today. 

From the Banana Kingdom, and shawnz

&gt; Why bananas?

&gt;&gt; shawnz: Because the IRC channel was made way back when [this](http://i.imgur.com/ka71V.gif) was popular

&gt;&gt; Vilkku: Because

&gt;&gt; SonicSam: I know deep down in my heart that the universe was brought into existence to display the marvel that is bananas. It is not a question of why bananas

&gt; What's your favorite thing about bananas?

&gt;&gt; shawnz: They have [handles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBJV56WUDng)

&gt;&gt; Vilkku: [That the skin comes right off.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UWRyj5cHIQA#t=121s)

&gt;&gt; SonicSam: We work great with banana bread. [We are also great utility in the master of our own domain.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWzOQTFwRBE)

&gt; I like my bananas best sliced

&gt;&gt; Sliced

&gt;&gt; Vilkku: [In cakes!](http://uktv.co.uk/images/300240/17914.jpg)

&gt;&gt; SonicSam: Banana bread

So there you have it. A very informative interview about bananas. And that's all there is to see here ~~for now~~.

**Edit:**

Now that the pickles have put their guard down

&gt; Let's talk a little about r/pickles. How did the war begin?

&gt;&gt; Vilkku: The cowardly pickles

&gt; What's your message to your faithful banana lovers?

&gt;&gt; Vilkku: Be bold

&gt; What's your message to the unfaithful pickle lovers?

&gt;&gt; Vilkku: Dill will Die!

... you gotta admit thats some fine references, how many college kids do you know that lived day and night for ramen. You can count me in that group. But this subreddit isn't just about the instant noodley goodness. No. This subreddit is also about the professionally made ramen as well.

I swear some of the pics in this subreddit are so well take, the endless variey of toppings. From steak, to fried chicken, to pork, to bacon, you get the idea.

Interview with the mods on the way.

&gt; 1 When did you realize you love ramen?

&gt;&gt;**/u/vectorix108** I realized my love for ramen when my parents first made it for me! It is one of my earliest memories. Now as a college student I eat it all the time (Big surprise right).

&gt; 2 What is your favorite bowl of ramen?

&gt;&gt;**vectorix108** I like all kinds of ramen

&gt; 3 If you could put a special ingredient into ramen what would it be?

&gt;&gt;**vectorix108** I'm from Texas

&gt; 4 Do you have a funny story related to ramen?

&gt;&gt;**vectorix108** Nothing really funny stands out but during my Sophomore year I attempted to eat only ramen for a week just for the hell of it. I got so sick of it at the end of the week that I stopped eating it for 2 months. Would not recommend. Thankfully I didn't get scurvy though.

&gt; 5 Tell about /r/ramen's community? (What are the users like

I'm not one to boast subreddits all the time, in the fullest. At the very least glance into that subreddit. Look with your own eyes, the shear beauty it has to offer. I gasped in amazement as I realized these weren't originally colored photographs. But rather black &amp; white pictures that were later, with the help of digital magic aka photoshop painted. 

Another unique part of this subreddit is that its restricted its posting abilities to those who know what they're doing. So Mr Average Joe with his new mac can't just start posting his amateur collection. You gotta respect a subreddit that strives for quality over quantity.

I'd write more but the creator has so much to say


&gt; A proper introduction of /r/ColorizedHistory's posters by /u/Zuzahin.

&gt;&gt;######I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY.

&gt;&gt;######FOR SO LONG.

&gt;&gt;######I CAN NOT EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE.

&gt;&gt;Hi there, and I'm 18 years old. I created /r/ColorizedHistory about a month and a few moons ago, and it's gotten quite huge. I ran it alone, initially, but /u/Photojacker came in to the picture quite a few days after I created it and started posting colorizations together with me, his name is Jay and he's 29, and my sugar-daddy. I've long admired the colorizations of /u/MyGrapeFruit , and she and I got to talking over mutual interests one day, who already before me giving her advice

And an wonderful interview as well

&gt;1 How did /r/ColorizedHistory come to be? / How did you find it?

&gt;&gt;**zuzahin** I actually created this Subreddit at the request of a few people in my r/Pics thread that garnished around 2900 upvotes, lol. I launched the Subreddit and started out with a whopping 25 subscribers, and this was pleasing to me, I mean I'm newish to Reddit (One year and counting), and having a Subreddit of my own was a big thing. A couple of big posts later and I'm sitting on 1250 subscribers (currently), people really love colorized images!

&gt;&gt;**photojacker** After commenting on some of Mads' work after seeing on /r/Colorization

&gt;2 What motivated you to colorize historic pictures?

&gt;&gt;**zuzahin** History, people with the same mannerisms and appearances as today, the same sort of humor, just... us, so long ago. It blows my mind to look at a photograph that's over 150 years old, and be able to stare directly in to the other person's eye. We're separated by so much, and yet we're still so close.

&gt;&gt;**photojacker** Images for the purposes of historical record are always really interesting because they always have a story to tell. I always get a thrill out of going into a fair amount of depth researching the story behind the picture and will do any means necessary; from finding eBay auctions on vintage advertising and signs to contacting family members of subjects in any particular photo. Any memory or insight to allow me to gauge a more authentic end result is worth the effort

&gt;3 What was the first picture you colorized? 

&gt;&gt;**zuzahin**  [**Alfred Terry**](http://i4.minus.com/iOl7kh3tHaUhe.jpg). I saw this image on Wikipedia randomly browsing through the list of Civil War Generals at random, to say the least](http://i7.minus.com/iwi05XaJK23Ts.jpg).

&gt;&gt;**photojacker** I believe I did a couple standing outside R. Buckminster Fuller's geodesic [Montreal Biosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Biosph%C3%A8re) for the 1967 World Fair. It wasn't very good in hindsight but I didn't have any idea what I was doing at the time.

&gt;4 Which post is your favorite so far?

&gt;&gt;**zuzahin**  There's too many to choose from, [**Yuri Gagarin**](http://redd.it/1627hw). I found this in a Flickr album of a private collector of Yousuf Karsh photographs, and his teeth stood out to me - I had to colorize it, lol.

&gt;&gt;**photojacker** Hands down

&gt;5 How long does it take you to do one piece (of art)?

&gt;&gt;**zuzahin** It really depends. The quality of the image, the Yuri Gagarin took 2½ hours, 1 hour was dedicated to research and tinkering with the colors. A normal one-piece suit+head &amp; shoulders portrait will take around 20-30 minutes, depending on size &amp; detail. Anything outdoors-y, or multiple people involved, it will run an hour or two, possibly three.

&gt;&gt;**photojacker** It really depends on the subject

&gt;6 For future colorist

&gt;&gt;**zuzahin**  I'd say watch my tutorial - very simply, a mix of colors, darker colors for shadow areas (i.e. the skin shouldn't be glowing orange on a shadowed part of his face, shade that!), and warmer more orange-y colors for brighter areas. It's hard to put in to so few words what it is that makes them so realistic - But add incredibly many colors to the face. Oranges, reds, blues, the whole works

&gt;&gt;**photojacker** Zuzahin's video is probably the best guide I've seen out there so far in terms of learning the skills. I'd say start expanding that knowledge with learning how to do different ethnicities,,False,self,t5_2sgno,1357600209.0,,True

I've touched on this subject before

When, one had the feeling that with moxie and determination, one could *make it somewhere*. The land was peaceful and pastoral. (I assure this is how everything exactly was, and not romanticized at all.)

Now /r/funny has the population of approximately 2 Rhode Islands. The once quiet squares and dusty bazaars are now swarming with the masses, and exotic stories. It's quite easy to get lost here, or circle nothing but the crass outlets like /r/politics. 

Fortunately, [meta discussions](/r/theoryofreddit), [hot new reddits](/r/subredditoftheday), and [juicy drama](/r/subredditdrama).

With these resources, external issues concerning reddit, and changes coming to reddit, and serves it up to you, dear reader, on a silver platter. 

Although it's still a relatively new project, reason shall once again rule - the quarrels and hunts shall cease,  /r/WTF shall ""go back to its roots"" once and for all, and the Mind_Virus alt account shall lie down with the repost vigilante. 

Or maybe it will just be helpful for keeping track of reddit. I don't know myself

The delightful mod team of MetaHub spent a little time chatting with us about the project thus far

_______

&gt;Tell us a bit about yourselves. How long have you been redditing

&gt;&gt;**God_Of_Atheism**: Lo, reddit was a place of mirth and joy, until the scourge of the eternal september came to pass upon it, and it was flooded by foul beings such as Brian, the man of ill fortune, Greg the 'good', and those who would venture to tell you of their adventures cut short by arrows to their patella. They have descended upon the land not to bring joy

&gt;&gt;**davidreiss666**: Long time. Since before the beginning of time. I think. Or maybe just the last 6 days. I'm confused.

&gt;&gt;**relic2279**: I joined back in 07 apparently. I say 'apparently' because my life is one big drunken blur. Sure

&gt;&gt;Everything [has changed]. Though, people are free to create their own subreddits which don't. This new system of 'subreddits' is what allowed reddit to not only grow, but prosper. It's reddit's golden wonka ticket.

&gt;&gt;**sulf**: I moved here from Digg two years ago, reddit gifts, and administrators' initiatives such as the SOPA blackout.

&gt;&gt;**syncretic**: My profile says I've been redditing since February 6th, and it was a big deal. I remember Mr. Splashy Pants. I remember when rage comics and advice animals weren't confined to their own subreddits (the humanity!). For the most part, however, I think reddit has changed for the better. Sure, the front page is mostly shit, but it's entertaining shit. It draws people in. Once they're here, once they start to delve deeper, and that's fine. For the ones that do

&gt;&gt;Favorite hobby? There's probably a subreddit for that.

&gt;&gt;Favorite tv show? There's probably a subreddit for that.

&gt;&gt;Favorite music genre? There's probably a subreddit for that.

&gt;&gt;Favorite sports team? There's probably a subreddit for that.

&gt;&gt;The best part is

&gt;What inspired the creation of MetaHub? What are the subreddit's goals?

&gt;&gt;**G_O_A**: In the distant realms the people cried out for a champion, rose to aid them in their time of need. First were the SFWporns, and the people looked upon them, and their hearts were filled with joy, and they flocked to them. Then he thought to form a republic, it's rules at the whim of the people, and it's purpose grand. The people rejoiced and spoke highly of the realm, and the republic was never truly formed. Still it lingers on though

&gt;&gt;Syncretic did not lose hope at this loss however. Blackstar9000, saw promise in Syncretic, and bestowed upon him a boon, TheoryOfReddit. Syncretic found his calling there in that land. His was not to lead great realms, but merely advise them and assist as he could. Thus came the founding of his merchant group, the MetaHub, their purpose not to ascend to glory themselves, to give them succor and to show them what they might ascend to.

&gt;&gt;**dr666**: Intergalactic domination of the spice trade.

&gt;&gt;**r2279**:You'll have to ask syncretic. :)

&gt;&gt;**Zazie_Lavender**: Syncretic

&gt;&gt;**sulf**: Increasing subreddit specialization that we can observe all over reddit, and submissions that are considered off-topic in some subreddits and are thus removed would make excellent posts in others. /r/MetaHub attempts to allow individual subreddits keep their focus, while at the same time aggregating the best content from all other reddits, effectively emulating a single unmoderated (as in without a particular on-topic statement other than it's meta) global subreddit. At the same time, the quality of posts here is maintained by four levels of filtering: (1) initial mod approval of posts in their original subreddits, (2) votes and discussion in original posts, (3) consideration to be worthy of submission to /r/MetaHub by our contributors

&gt;&gt;**syn**:I love reddit, most of which perform a valuable function, but with the exceptions of the big dogs like /r/TheoryOfReddit, /r/SubredditDrama and /r/Circlebroke, on the whole they're pretty... well, boring. Uninteresting. Dull. Not to mention, there are oodles of them. Sure, or two

&gt;&gt;MetaHub's function is to compile the best and most interesting meta discussion from not only the dozens of meta subreddits

&gt;What do you think reddit will look like in one year? Five years?

&gt;&gt;**tick_tock_clock**: I am convinced that we are in something of a golden age of memes: they are a huge part of popular culture

&gt;&gt;But this is something that I think won't last. Memes are in fashion right now, there won't be much of an effect - r/AdviceAnimals will look about the same as now. But in five, we will scarcely recognize it. Some people will still use it, but they will be behind the curve, out of fashion. I am not foolish enough to predict what the next great trend will be, but reaction .gifs seem to offer one option, and the answer is likely to be some sort of standardized image.

&gt;&gt;...then

&gt;&gt;As for the rest of Reddit,000 subscribers on /r/funny would make it any different from 2 million now. However, in a year (and even more so in five), it's likely that Reddit's strong growth of the past two years will flatten out a little, and there will be fewer confused newbies. Consequently, inside jokes will last longer and Reddit will probably become a little less understandable to outsiders, furthering the trend of flattening growth.

&gt;&gt;1: I am using the narrow definition of meme as an image macro. I know this is not correct; forgive me.

&gt;&gt;**G_O_A**: Woe unto ye who would delve into the unwritten verses of the song of orange and blue

&gt;&gt;**dr666**: I'm the wrong person to ask. I still surf Reddit with scripts and preferences that keep it looking mostly like it did back in 2006.

&gt;&gt;**r2279**: I hope reddit doesn't change much. As long as their growth continues at it's current pace, I hope reddit looks [like this](http://s3.amazonaws.com/sp.reddit.com/reddit2.html). Reddit 2.0. (I kid, I kid)

&gt;&gt;**sulf**: Perhaps one major admin-level change would be reorganization of the default subreddit mechanism, so we should be looking at users' and moderators' initiatives -- in particular, collaborations between moderators (such as this subreddit or networks).

&gt;&gt;**syn**: I don't think the front page will change much without some major overhaul of the reddit code. We've already arrived at the lowest common denominator, good times.

&gt;&gt;What can I say? I'm an optimist.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/MetaHub?

&gt;&gt;**G_O_A**: Brace yourselves

&gt;&gt;**dr666**: SidtheMagicLobster should be prepared with butter and garlic. Also

&gt;&gt;**r2279**: Subscribe. We'll make all your dreams come true.

&gt;&gt;**sulf**: It is expected that a lot of interesting submissions would come from flagship meta reddits such as /r/TheoryOfReddit

&gt;&gt;**agentlame**: Interest in meta-reddit is a pretty niche subject matter. I'd only ask that subscribers be on the look-out for threads about reddit that aren't posted to 'meta' subs

Some say this sub-reddit smells like Gouda cheese when directly facing sunlight and that it is the best sub-reddit in the known galaxy focused on older men talking about non-sense and cars. All we know is

You may ask, the highest octane level of comedy and stupidity disguised as a car review show, only the British can provide. Just like Doctor Who mastered the art of mixing Sci-fi &amp; comedy. So has TopGear mastered the art of entertaining both car enthusists / petrolheads / wrench monkeys and whatever you want to call these [guys](/r/carporn ""Keep up the good work, guys."") and the average joe together in harmony. 

Top Gear is broadcast in 170 different countries. BBC claims Top Gear has a viewership of 350 million per week. [These numbers are speculated and are not confirmed by released BBC ratings.](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/21/60minutes/main6978679.shtml) Whether these numbers hold true, with my trusty calculator... hmmm thats 17% of the whole world, (Btw, I'm talking about Earthlings) watches this show. So what are you waiting for?

Now to the interview with some of the mods from /r/TopGear.

&gt;##1. Since when have you been watching Top Gear. Got any stories?

&gt;&gt;**insanemo** Late 2003; I believe that was season 3 my first episode was S03E02.

&gt;&gt;**smardalek** It's been about two years...a friend introduced me to it and told me 'it's funny

&gt;&gt;**Big_J** Right around 2003~2004. I just randomly happened upon it and thought ""what is this show and where has it been all my life?!"" I then found FinalGear.com and began getting into the show pretty heavy from that point forward.

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** I've been watching Top Gear for a few years now. I began watching when some friends turned me on to it, I remember seeing the Britcar 24 hour challenge film and falling in love with the show. As far as stories go, I spent a good bit of money buying all the episodes on Amazon Instant Video service only to discover that they were available on Netflix. Oh well, I don't regret it. Top Gear's worth it.

&gt;##2. Favorite Episode? Got a clip / link to it? If not

&gt;&gt;**insanemo** [Vietnam Special](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IfC51s510I) followed by [Polar Special](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVECU3T4BEI)

&gt;&gt;**smardalek** It's hard to pick a favourite for me because I tend to watch and rewatch Top Gear in marathons (then they all blend together and I have a hard time picking out what happened in the individual episodes. It's basically ""remember that one time? that was awesome!""...and that happens a lot.) I love all of the specials though

&gt;&gt;**Big_J** I don't really have a favorite ep but I do have favorite parts. Mainly these are where they say funny little jokes at each others expense. One example would be when Richard and Jeremy are in a gas station while James is out trying to fix his car. Jeremy asks if Richard is going to buy James a candy bar and he responds, Jeremy just states, ""James only gave me two"". I think those little things are the best parts of the show, more so than any single segment or episode.

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** My favorite episode of Top Gear. That's a tough one. I suppose the one that I just mentioned - Series 10 Episode 9 - is my favorite. The love and dedication those guys showed getting that 330 through the race was inspiring to me

&gt;##3. Who is your favorite Jeremy

&gt;&gt;**insanemo** Initially you have to say Jeremy as without him there simply is no TopGear. That being said; I think Hammond is the one that can be most easily replaced; Jeremy and James bring a interesting dynamic that would be hard to replicate with others. I love the personality of James though.

&gt;&gt;**smardalek** Jezza is hands-down my favourite presenter, though...leaving Hammond as my 'least' favourite, although I would be quite sad if he were to leave the show. I enjoy his childish enthusiasm the most of the three, though Jeremy's tends to be the funniest while James' excitement over certain things is priceless.

&gt;&gt;**Big_J** I like each of them for different reasons but for pure entertainment purposes, including everything he does outside of TG (James and Oz wine/etc) I have to pick James May. His reviews are always consistent and he brings a nice level of intelligence to the whole show.

&gt;&gt; As for the marry/fuck/kill... I would say Vicky Butler Henderson pre-kids for the first two. For kill it would have to be the guy on Fifth Gear who did the road safety stuff. His accent was annoying and he was boring. I loathed every segment he was in.

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** My favorite presenter is Hammond. He has a certain excitement over cars that he loves that the other presenters lack, who have such chemistry and friendship with each other, that if even one was to be replaced the show would lose almost all of it's personality and charm.

&gt;##4. What is it about cars and Top Gear that gets you to love it soo much?

&gt;&gt;**insanemo** There are two type of TopGear watchers gearheads/petrolheads and those that watch the show for entertainment purposes only. The beauty of the show is that for the gearheads like myself we get enough about cars to make it worth watching and enough entertainment to keep us watching. As for cars; they are beautiful; the simplest expression of freedom is having the ability to travel and wander freely. The car brought this unique ability to the masses in a way never before seen; most of us not only love our cars and working on them; we love the simple act of driving. The feeling of zipping through a mountain pass on a clear day on an empty ribbon of asphalt is one that few other things can parallel.

&gt;&gt;**smardalek** Mo puts it rather well, I imagine. :P

&gt;&gt;**Big_J** I would have to say it's the charisma between the hosts as well as the knowledge and intelligence/wit they bring with them. In the US there isn't anything that really compares

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** Well, and belong to a few car clubs and do cruises and such in my bimmer (BMW). Top Gear help sparked my interest in cars and the like, as I started watching it before I got my license and it opened the doors for me to love cars. Additionally, Top Gear helps me keep ""current"" on my car knowledge - I've learned more about cars from Top Gear than from any other source, except maybe my grandfather. And finally their exciting, original, and hilarious challenges are fun to watch

&gt;##5. Tell us about your community? What makes them so special?

&gt;&gt;**insanemo** We are freaking awesome. I like to think our humble community embodies the spirit of TopGear we have aspects of all the presenters.

&gt;&gt;**smardalek** This community is amazing! In addition to their enthusiasm to bringing up the best things relevant to the show, sort of rallied behind our changes. They let us know what they like and what we should change--which is helpful because that's what we're here for in addition to the shenanigans of the fandom--to make it the best it can be for them. /end cheesyness! Sorry, bit carried away there!

&gt;&gt;**Big_J** Our community is awesome on two parts. First it is thanks to the great people who read and submit to the subreddit and keep it running

&gt;&gt;The other thing that makes it great are the great mods that we have now. It wasn't long ago that r/TopGear was slowly but surely dieing. Thankfully secretagentmang took it over and brought in some fresh blood and so far they have been doing great things

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** Our community is absolutely fantastic. We're at nearly 10, when me and a few other moderators were brought on the scene, the subreddit was dying because of a lack of new episodes airing and a general lack of posts being submitted. When we told everyone that we were going to try to breath some life into the subreddit, by updating the layout and all that jazz, the community immediately took it upon themselves to breath a new life into our sub. The quality and quantity of posts shot up and people began upvoting and commenting like they had a fire under their rears! Heck, just tonight I was going to submit an episode discussion thread to get people talking about the Christmas Special that aired. Lo and behold, when I got to the sub there was already a thread that someone had submitted doing just that! That's something that hasn't happened on a consistent basis in the sub

&gt;&gt;And on a personal note

**4775 Anime lovers for 1 year**

What can I say about anime that hasn’t already been said? It’s an amazing medium which can take stories with a simple premise and go widely off into another direction. There are tales of love and hate

In /r/animegifs these epic moments are condensed down into the beloved Gif format to deliver you the truly best bits of each episode. There are fools who may think all you can do with these moments of madness is sit and adore them but no! These are not gifs for viewing but reacting too! [Time to NOPE your way out of a thread?](http://i.imgur.com/tqU8Zl1.jpg) [A cute but shocking surprise?]( http://i.imgur.com/nPuhz.gif) [I don’t even know where you’d use this.]( http://i.minus.com/iKAlPKjivSggV.gif) 

Anime gifs can take gifs onto a new level

Personally I love this subreddit as it always delivers top quality gifs everyday and I rarely ever see a blurry or badly converted Gif but down to the Mods doing a fine job. Also through it I’ve picked up a fair few anime that I plan to watch for various reasons. [Seriously how can you not love this?]( http://i.minus.com/iAZLLV1nNy60c.gif) There will always be a place for real life gifs but one day when you get sick and tired of boring normality /r/animegifs is waiting for you. Time for a word from the fine Mods of /r/animegifs!

&gt;##1. Why and When was /r/animegifs born?
&gt;&gt;**Aradon** /r/animegifs was created on Monday March 26th 2012 at 23:17:38 UTC.  I've always considered gifs to be the perfect medium for expression of ideas on the internet.  It is simple, beautiful, cute, creepy, and just plane amazing.  Also, I pronounce them [gif, not jif](http://i.imgur.com/25Ifx.gif)

&gt;&gt;**RoFl_ChOpS** I was not a part of /r/animegifs formation

&gt;##2. What makes a good /r/animegifs post?
&gt;&gt;**Aradon** I feel like /r/animegifs has had a close relationship with /r/awwnime and so a good /r/animegifs post is typically either something that is popular at the time (Attack on Titan for example) or something that induces aww.  At the least

&gt;&gt;In the end

&gt;&gt;**RoFl_ChOpS** I think /u/Aradon answered this perfectly.

&gt;##3. What's your most awesome anime gif?
&gt;&gt;**Aradon** Oh God

&gt;&gt;[Funniest Classic](http://i.imgur.com/sJQ9e.gif) (Pokemon)

&gt;&gt;[Funniest Current](http://i.minus.com/iErUd51pFWagr.gif) (Attack on Titan)

&gt;&gt;[Beautiful One](http://i.imgur.com/1TI6K.gif) Mushishi

&gt;&gt;**RoFl_ChOpS** It's hard to choose
 
&gt;##4. What's the funniest out of context anime gif you know?
&gt;&gt;**Aradon** [For non-anime fans](http://i.imgur.com/m0qRH.gif)

&gt;&gt;[For anime fans](http://i.imgur.com/7SyZdJE.gif)

&gt;&gt;**RoFl_ChOpS** I think [this one.](http://i.imgur.com/yx4Zfqx.gif)

&gt;##5. Which anime world would you like to live in?
&gt;&gt;**Aradon** I guess that depends if I get to be a hero or just someone in the world.

 &gt;&gt;If I'm a hero

 &gt;&gt;If I end up being just someone in the background (and excluding slice of life/shows grounded in reality) then I'd probably go with something like [Sword Art Online](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) or [Ghost in the Shell: SAC](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex)

&gt;&gt;**RoFl_ChOpS** I think either the Nasuverse([Kara no Kyoukai, even if it's not always in the best of ways.

&gt;##6. Is there anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt;**Aradon** My subscribers are awesome.  At the beginning it was a lot of work for me with posting of gifs and advertising

 &gt;&gt;/u/RoFl_ChOpS was invited to become a moderator specifically because of his contributions to the subreddit and as we grow (and as we need more moderators) I plan to continue to promote from within.  

&gt;&gt;So subscribers

I should put a disclaimer that I'm part of their mod team. But I'm in charge of the CSS layout only. So I have no real part in making it as awesome as it has become so far. All credit goes to the rest of the mods on /r/LastImages. All this subreddit needs is your love

Some people looked at [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/abandonedporn) buildings and thought: Why not explore the hidden inside? So they grabbed a flashlight and something to eat ( lets say cookies), but still beauty. 



Urbanexploration is all about exploring abandoned buildings
At /r/Urbanexploration the posters go on an exploration and let you witness their experiences through e.g. pictures or videos. 

I have experienced only one urban exploration in my life. It is actually the sequel to the castle story [I wrote a few weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/11epnc/october_13_2012_rabandonedporn_making_creepy/). And due to some requests I thought this would be the perfect moment to tell this story. It is actually also one of the only interesting stories I have experienced

Chapter one.
*One day me and three other friends had a sleepover, we stood infront of the castle holding one flashlight. One part of me was curious and excited to finally see the inside of that mysterious building. The other part was scared as shit and asked him over and over again: Why am I doing this?*

Chapter two.
*We entered the castle. The first part didn't had a roof anymore and was filled with plants
We went to the what I thought was the living room. The room was empty, and we were curious if there was anything inside it.*

*I don't know why we didn't tell the other guys we were going to the cupboard. I had seen enough horror movies to should have known better. But we still walked towards the cupboard
I froze. 
We were too scared to yell their names
A cold hand grabbed my arm.*

*Dear readers
And in those five seconds a lot happened. 
I screamed as loud as possible, finally seeing my attackers*

*So there we were, one of them having a bloody nose, the other one laughing. That was the last time I got inside that old building.*

Now the question is: What did we learn from this story? 
**If you ever decide to enter an abandoned building

Now an exclusive and awesome interview with moderator /u/nonex!

&gt;##1. Can you give a short summary about /r/Urbanexploration?
&gt;&gt; **nonex** It's quite simple really, video and discussion.


&gt;##2. What do you think is a ""perfect"" post on this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **nonex** A perfect post in this subreddit will point to an epic adventures that tantalize the soul
Here's my hands down favorite: http://sleepycity.net/posts/67/DIY-Supervillain-Hideout
Another awesome adventure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWF3IDk9Gek

&gt;##3. Have you ever done an urban exploration? If so
&gt;&gt; **nonex** I've done some exploring over the years but nothing compared to my internet heroes linked above. When I was a teenager I'd go up overflow drains, explore abandoned hotels and even managed to get into strip club once.

&gt;##4. What do you like the most about urban exploration?
&gt;&gt; **nonex** For me, get into the guts of an active building or ride the front of a subway car so I can try and peek down the tunnel. Urban Exploration is about being aware of your surroundings and being curious. You see a door, you question what's behind it. You see a manhole cover, you question if there's a vault beneath it. You want to see the hidden areas around you. Getting into some of these spots makes you hyper-aware of your surroundings, especially if you're not supposed to be there. It can make the hairs on the back of your neck tingle and your heart race. As the blood rushes through your veins, your ears pick up the slightest noises and your eyes see the slightest movements. It's quite remarkable.

&gt;##5. What do you like to see changed about your subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **nonex** I found myself as a mod on this subreddit after a previous mod nuked his account. I've never heard from the other two mods so I guess it's just me here. I'm pretty happy with this subreddit as it is

&gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to say?
&gt;&gt; **nonex** I don't really have much else to say except that I recently had my 7th cake day and I've been told I'm probably one the oldest active users on reddit. Not sure if I should be proud of that or not.

So,* The Incredible Hulk*, *Iron Man 2*, *Thor*, *Captain America: The First Avenger*, *The Avengers*, and *Iron Man 3*, except for in most of the world where it’s already out.  *The Avengers* is also

Okay

The Marvel Cinematic Universe does not include any Marvel films from before 2008, *X-Men*, or *The Fantastic Four* films, nor does it concern itself with the perpetually in production *Deadpool.*

/r/marvelstudios focuses on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  They obviously focus on the seven previously mentioned films, it can be discussed here.  They don’t care how excited you are about *X-Men: Days of Future Past* - that’s Fox and not at all related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I sat down with the /u/kaijunexus and asked some serious questions.

&gt;#1. What caused you to want to be part of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**kaijunexus** My undying love for and obsession with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

&gt;&gt;In fact

&gt;&gt;I've been a huge fan of the MCU ever since Marvel Studios started production on Iron Man (2008) and The Incredible Hulk (2008) and there were rumblings of Marvel making an attempt to create a unified cinematic universe. I was immediately sold on the idea and was further excited by the fact that this universe would be constructed and overseen by ""the House of Ideas"" itself rather than some outside that had no hand in the creation of these characters.

&gt;&gt;Of course

&gt;&gt;After some time

&gt;#2. What is your favorite movie in the MCU that isn’t *The Avengers*?

&gt;&gt;**kaijunexus** How do you know me so well?! lol

&gt;&gt;Yeah

&gt;&gt;But aside from The Avengers? I'd have to say Iron Man (2008). I honestly love all of the MCU films to death and am probably a die-hard apologist for anything negative regarding any of them...but some of the films definitely have a few issues, is just so close to a perfect film. It really was lightning in a bottle.

&gt;&gt;I'm hoping, I think there's a good chance that it might! ;)

&gt;#3. If you could choose one licensed Marvel property to return to Marvel Studios

&gt;&gt;**kaijunexus** Wow...that's a tough one. I'd really prefer they all be with Marvel Studios

&gt;&gt;I'd have to say the Fantastic Four. X-Men actually exist quite nicely in their own little world (for now) and the same goes for Spider-Man to an extent. But the Fantastic Four bring so much to the table in the Marvel Universe...other dimensions, Galactus and the Silver Surfer, their friendships and rivalries with other Marvel characters...and that's all tied up at Fox right now, unfortunately.

&gt;#4. Do you have hopes for an Avengers movie that would one day include Wolverine and Spider-Man?

&gt;&gt;**kajunexus** I absolutely hold out hope for not only an Avengers movie that would include Wolverine and Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four.

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately

&gt;&gt;BUT

&gt;#5. Fox is having a hard enough time getting a *Deadpool* movie out.  Could you imagine Disney doing it?  Do you think they could make it fit in the MCU?

&gt;&gt;**kajunexus** That's a multi-faceted question, he's very quirky and bizzare...which makes it difficult for studios to imagine a large demographic for. And done wrong, he's boring and cliche, and you risk losing fan support.

&gt;&gt;I think the problem of the bloodiness of Deadpool really plays second-fiddle to those issues in the eyes of a studio.

&gt;&gt;But if Fox could make it work

&gt;#6. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**kajunexus** I'd just like to thank you very much for featuring us as the subreddit of the day!! I can't believe how fast we've grown in under a year

Thank you, and if you’re so inclined check out *Iron Man 3* in theatres May 3 unless you got it last week, in which case, I hate you.  Seriously, since when does the US and Canada get movies almost last?  I could have already driven south and seen it in Mexico.  I feel you, the rest of the world, on usually getting movies late.  I feel you.  At least we’re not Poland – they have to wait another week.  Sucks to be you,,False,t3_1dgobf

It's Friday! And you know what that means

But seriously, congratulations, you just decided that Rebecca Black is more deserving of your time than James Bond.

Those of you who are lucky enough to have already watched Skyfall

But /r/JamesBond isn't just about Skyfall. It's about **everything** James Bond. Want to talk about Casino Royale

But speaking of Skyfall

Now before we get to the interview

I'll give you a clue: It's not the James Bond theme.

&gt;##1. Is /r/JamesBond more about the books

&gt;&gt;**BearFromPhilly**/r/JamesBond is just that, video-games, and anything else even remotely Bond-related. Unlike some other subreddits, we're very laid back, we don't really have any rules besides the removal of blatant spam. I personally don't enjoy the schisms that other subreddits seem to experience, hence why I asked /u/lazerwolf852 to merge his existing /r/JamesBond007 with ours.


&gt;&gt;**lazerwolf852**As a 007 fan, but I love that he's so adaptable and when I think ""James Bond,"" I automatically relate it to everything he' been in. It's actually these different evolutions of the character that have helped him stand the test of time. He changes with the times and the medium. We all have different values in approaching a new film, book, video game, etc. and being vocal about that is fun. That's why a community like this sub is so great...that's why being a James Bond fan is so great.

&gt;&gt;**SinatraFan77**Our sub-reddit is much more defined towards that of the movies

&gt;##2. How would you rank the James Bond actors from favorite to least favorite?

&gt;&gt;**BearFromPhilly**Moore is my absolute favorite, as Connery is the most widely recognized Bond figure, while Brosnan has the perfect mix of intelligence, wit, and action. After those three, I would say Timothy Dalton, who I think played a fantastic Bond (I actually just watched The Living Daylights on BBC America last night before The Walking Dead) I believe he would have been more popular had he a chance to star as Bond more than twice. The I would say Daniel Craig is my least favorite Bond; this is another controversial view, however

&gt;&gt;(I don't even count Lazenby, and especially as Bond.)

&gt;&gt;**lazerwolf852**I gotta go Connery at first. He set the standard and I cannot imagine the character without picturing him. Then it's Dalton, Brosnan, Lazenby. Don't get me wrong...I don't dislike any of them.

&gt;&gt;**SinatraFan77**Personally, Craig, Dalton, Moore, Lazenby.

&gt;##3. What's your favorite book and/or movie?

&gt;&gt;**BearFromPhilly**My favorite Book is Dr. No probably because it was the first Bond book I ever read. My favorite movie is Live and Let die

&gt;&gt;(Not to mention

&gt;&gt;**lazerwolf852**My favorite book is Casino Royale. I've read it a number of times and there's just something so fully realized about the character and the world he lives in there. It's really a small scale story and because of that, the music, the story, the cast.

&gt;&gt;**SinatraFan77**My favorite movie is The Man With the Golden Gun and Goldeneye.

&gt;##4. If you could work for MI6

&gt;&gt;**BearFromPhilly**I would definitely want to work in a Felix Leiter role

&gt;&gt;**lazerwolf852**Come on. Who doesn't want to be James Bond

&gt;&gt;**SinatraFan77**That's a great question. Obviously

&gt;##5. What expectations do you have for Skyfall?

&gt;&gt;**BearFromPhilly**As I mentioned previously, from what I've heard so far, this film is going to be less random action scenes and more of the suave secret agent I know and love.

&gt;&gt;**lazerwolf852**For me personally, there's an amazing cast and filmmakers behind it and the reviews have been phenomenal. I cannot wait.

&gt;&gt;**SinatraFan77**I have extremely high hopes for Skyfall. While Craig may not be my favorite Bond, sets up for one I cannot wait to see and, I think, a possible chance at being one of the all-time greats.

&gt;##6. What do you have to say to those who think James Bond is ""meh""?

&gt;&gt;**BearFromPhilly**Give it a shot! All of the Bond films are different. If you start with something as mediocre as...well...anything with Lazenby

&gt;&gt;If you reach the Brosnan era and you still don't like it

&gt;&gt;**lazerwolf852**Simply put

&gt;&gt;**SinatraFan77**James Bond is not a movie for everyone. However, they are over the top etc. etc."" that is one of Bond's styles. Bond is not going to have a movie about him raising a kid named Charles and getting a day-job at the local pub. He is going to kick ass, and he is going to do it well. The movies all have their own styles, own premises, and their own flair to go with them. The only combining element in the movies is that the main character's name is James Bond, Agent 007.

Sure in the recent electronic market America has been coming back stronger than ever with the likes of Apple, Google and even Microsoft. But there is something about a Japanese product and it's quirkiness that makes it special.

But if you were a kid of the 00's (oh god its already been 12 years) you were watching a dude get really angry, scream at the top of his lungs, turn his hair from black to yellow and then shot nonstop lasers out of their hands at badguys with square ear holes for half an hour and you'd love it.

Power down  [Goku](/r/dbz), /r/FairyTail is here to stay. [Jim Cramer](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pvth8/) is already forcasting a massive shift in karma. So if you haven't figured it out, FairyTail is all about wizards. Its the newest major trend, wizards that is. Especially since the Harry Potter trend was so big a few years ago. It was the only logical step. Get a bunch of [teens with attitudes](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/vbjd4/june_20_2012_rpowerrangers_magic_wand_make_my/), give them magic powers and let them fight other mages, witches and wizards but with the good old japanese twist. Its Gold Jerry-kun-sempai-sama-sensai-chan, Gold!

Fairy tail is sorta unique in anime / manga styles where instead of one hero being the major focus the main cast shares it equally. Unfortunately if I started talking about all the characters and side characters this article wouldn't end for days. So I'll just give you a micro intro to the main

What can be said about books? One of my favorite authors likes to say that he feels bad for people who don't read because they only get to live one life

Heck: watch any good Sci-Fi movie or show and you'll see that books never go away. Even Picard preferred paper-based books

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: I am a moderator of a lot of general reddits, we try to keep spam down, we point people to other subreddits that are similar or more specific to their interests, and we have a list of the community's favorite books. We let users share the books they're reading in their flair. deodrus has done most of this, and he really made me feel good about choosing him.

&gt;Your subreddit has a beautiful design and I have a sneaking suspicion I know who's responsible for it. Would the guilty party please explain how they went about creating such a great looking sub?

&gt;&gt;**deodrus**: Thanks for appreciating my efforts. :) Reddit already has a very utilitarian design where screen real-estate is used very practically. This is the reddit we have come to recognize and love. Adding unnecessary white-space and undoing the 'compact' form of reddit is a step backwards, and to take pride in our niche on the internet.

&gt;&gt;It isn't easy to please 95, function, and design of the original look of reddit, and there are those that would like to replace the upvote/downvote arrows with other graphics. Finding a balance between the two is tricky ground. In addition to my own design principles, I have borrowed inspiration (and sometimes code) from different artists to find a balance that works. I carry this skeletal framework of design to other subreddits as well, and build upon it to tailor it to the subreddit in question. I often get requests to borrow the CSS code for theming other subreddits, and I encourage anyone to borrow the code, or learn from it. Reddit is about sharing!

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: deodrus did most of the design

&gt;Speaking of moderating

&gt;&gt;**deodrus**: The community at /r/Books is a most pleasant one, and it is rare that I have to delete an abrasive comment. Our main duties lie with catching spammers and approving erroneously-flagged posts.

&gt;&gt;It is unusual to have two moderators for a community nearing 100, where decorum, civility, and mutual respect exist in plenitude. Perhaps the very act of reading cultivates these qualities? Someone might have to do a case study on that. haha...

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: There's almost no drama. And I think we're doing okay handling mod mail (we don't get nearly as many requests as other subreddits)

&gt;I received a Kindle Fire for my last birthday back in November. I have to admit, but my question is this: what would you say your community's overall opinion is of such technology?

&gt;&gt;**deodrus**: Our community is divided on the issue, and book-storage capacity of e-readers, and there are some who love the musky scent and texture of paper, the feeling of flipping pages, and the crinkle that forms on the stem of a well-read book. Not everyone can carry a book with them at all times as they can be cumbersome, and for those moments an e-reader can be an alternative. However, I do feel that our community is unanimous in their love and appreciation for physical books. As for myself, affection

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: From what I can tell, they are more likely than not bibliophiles. People here really like owning and reading physical books, but they also like reading itself. So my best guess is that some people love them, some people don't use them, but I don't think we have too many luddites. Personally I always buy a book and then pirate the e-copy for reading at night in bed.

&gt;Best book ever and why:

&gt;&gt;**deodrus**: ""Siddhartha"" by Herman Hesse, that drowns out the rigors of daily life and touches the roots of your heart. The very act of finishing the book threatens to make you a better person, and sets you on the first steps to a long journey of insight and self-reflection. I believe it is a book everyone will benefit from reading.

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: I can never choose one favorite anything, and because Stephenson is one of my favorite authors, and all his talents are on full display here. (Had trouble choosing between The Baroque Cycle and Anathem, which could make the list for just talking about things that last for 10,000 years in human society.)

&gt;Why do you think redditors should visit/subscribe to /r/Books?

&gt;&gt;**deodrus**: If you've ever read a book, or if you just want to see what the fuss is about... visit /r/Books! When the rest of reddit gets too noisy and you need a respite from the virtual elements, visit /r/Books! When you want to pay a visit to the library/bookstore to revel in its quiet serenity, but can't, visit /r/Books! When you're feeling downtrodden and alone, visit /r/Books... because ""One who reads is never alone."" :)

&gt;What related subreddits should redditors subscribe to after they subscribe to /r/Books?

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: /r/BooksAMA

Reddit is big.  Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to reddit.  

It's so big that you've probably missed something.  Not to worry!  Along with /r/tldr

The Redditor helps to combat reddit cravings by taking content on reddit (only the best stuff

For the non-reddicted folk

I sat down with [KILLTHEREDDITOR](/user/KILLTHEREDDITOR) (who, who graciously let me post the interview here (and let me live).

&gt;**What prompted you to start The Redditor?**
&gt;&gt;I had been getting tired of sludging through 8, so a month later we created another joke cover, but packed in 40 pages of good content. It started as a bit of a metaphor for how we viewed reddit, there’s a lot of junk on the surface, but if you dig deeper you can find legitimately unique and worthwhile content. Now we're starting to establish ourselves, the response has been great, and I think people are really enjoying this new way to discover and appreciate the site. We’re currently working hard on issue 6.

&gt;**What can we expect to see in the future?** 
&gt;&gt;The short term – because of our growing support, offer to donate, offer to pay, ask for print copies – but we are limited as far as licensing and copyright goes. It would be amazing to see our passion project turn into something more. An idea I had was that this magazine could become the new Reddit Gold - to offer reddit’s monthly subscribers something more substantial than a shiny icon, and a more compelling reason to get it. PDF or iPad subscription packages tied in with the Reddit Gold system, something like 1 dollar a month for the regular issue, 2 for an HD issues, so if this was backed by reddit and pushed as hard as the sweatshirts and stickers

&gt;**How do you pick out things from reddit?** 
&gt;&gt;To differentiate our magazine from everything else, AMA’s, Stories, and Pics. We dig all over the site through dozens of subreddits of all sizes to find good content to fill these chapters. At the end of each issue, we also feature a community of the month, with no real limitations as to what this could be. We also watch our subreddit closely to see what people would like to see in future issues, and after weeks of gathering content, and hope the larger community will find the same appreciation.

&gt;**Are you concerned with any copyright/censorship issues from reddit?**
&gt;&gt;No. As long as the magazine stays free, and photo sections – we send out permission requests asking users if we can use their work. To date, we haven’t had anyone turn us down. I think in general people are thrilled that their work is finding a larger audience and nice treatment. The use of the ‘Redditor’ name, as well as comments originating from this site are the main issues where copyright and licensing could be an issue. However, again, while we are not profiting, we’re not stepping on any toes. The reddit team has been very supportive so far.

&gt;**How have the admins/higher ups responded to the magazine?** 
&gt;&gt;Yes, Erik Martin [HueyPriest] gave us an amazing seven page photo series created by the reddit admin team to exclusively debut in our magazine. It’s great to know they’ve been enjoying and supportive what we’re doing.

&gt;**What can someone do to help out or make a suggestion?** 
&gt;&gt;Our reward is simply sharing the magazine with others. It means a lot to us when we see our subscriber count go up, and letting more people on reddit know about the project.

Mountains. Plains. Swamps. Islands. Forests.

This isn't a hike, using the land itself as a source of power, to take down their foes! Brute force, underhanded tactics, slick maneuvers, and total field dominance are key in succeeding in this all out battle for supremacy!

And all this is done with cardboard and ink.

The extremely popular trading card game Magic: the Gathering has taken the world by storm, or to have fun with a friend...or 7.

One of the many appeals of Magic is how diverse the game can become, or even preventing them from doing anything at all?

Luckily, Gmonkeylouie, quicksilvervii, and TheCid!

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;**TheCid:** A multi-layered

&gt;&gt;**quicksilvervii:** Aside from a CCG

&gt;What kind of posts do you most often see?

&gt;&gt;**TheCid:** People asking for deck construction help or rules clarification.

&gt;&gt;**quicksilvervii:** More popular posts consist of beginners asking for assistance or others reaching out to improve their skills and decks. The trading thread seems to be popular as well

&gt;&gt;**Gmonkeylouie:** We get a lot of posts on the Magic subreddit from beginners, there are almost always spoilers on the front page, along with discussions about which new cards are awesome and which ones are overrated. Magic players are creative, too -- there's always someone showing off their new favorite altered art cards or tokens. I think what I like best about the subreddit is that people are sharing their own experiences with playing and collecting.

&gt;For an aspiring Planeswalker

&gt;&gt;**TheCid:** Duels of the Planeswalkers (PC, especially since it won't have people teaching you misconceptions or lying to you in order to win games. It gets a couple things ""wrong on purpose"" to get it to fit in the video game form, but those are things which you can easily learn when you transition into real Magic.
For those who don't have a PC powerful enough or gaming consoles

&gt;&gt;**quicksilvervii:** Magic is not a cheap hobby. To familiarize yourself with the game and to see what kind of playstyle fits you may be overwhelming and expensive. I would advise new players to either borrow cards and play with friends

&gt;&gt;**Gmonkeylouie:** The best way to get into Magic, find a local game shop with Friday Night Magic events, and play as much as you can. Hopefully you can meet some friendly players, because casual formats are a lot of fun and help you develop a real feel for the flow of the game and a knack for working out complex rules interactions and strategic/tactical dilemmas. Play Emperor or 2HG with players who are better than you. Play a sweet cube. Play Commander and get stomped by someone with a $2000. Read all the online strategy you can, too, and try to wrap your head around the metagame. It's not easy to get good at Magic, and there are always lots of people who are better than you, that's winning in my book.

&gt;What're your favorite Magic colors

&gt;&gt;**TheCid:** I don't have a favorite color.

&gt;&gt;**quicksilvervii:** As an eternal (formats permitting and requiring to run older cards) player

This has become routine for me now

First off, and have you looked at the very top of the page? Ok, maybe I’m being a LITTLE harsh, just take out the Comic Sans and we’ll be fine. Maybe the effect will go away, but it would look better. Now that I think about, Comic Sans probably scared everyone away from the subreddit, that’s why no one’s posting there anymore... Come on! It’s possible!

And now /r/rainbowbar. Where the fuck do I begin. Oh yeah! That monstrosity at the bottom of the page. It makes the subreddit extremely difficult to navigate, that would be awesome, but guys, no one’s getting the joke here. When I see rainbows, I think of puppies and shit. Bitches love puppies, that’s fact.

**910 readers for 1 month**

In a world of 24/7 news, it's not hard to see why headliners are so preoccupied with predicting global doom and gloom.

But even if they're right, and life eventually went back to normal,  so why should this ""catastrophe"" be any different?

Instead


Such moments just aren't celebrated enough, though, it evokes a deep and powerful feeling that stirs some unexpectedly profound emotions if you let it sweep over you. 

And that, I knew I had to feature these guys. Sole moderator of /r/happycrowds, **/u/holytryst** was kind enough to take some out of his day to tell us more about his sub, share some of his favorite videos of happy crowds, and tell us how it came to all came to be.

&gt;1. What inspired you to create r/HappyCrowds?

&gt;&gt;**holytryst** It can be traced to [this post in /r/videos of 80, the responses to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/10yweq/psys_seoul_concert_80000_people_dancing_to/c6hxb0m). A user (stupidpanda) [had commented that](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/10yweq/psys_seoul_concert_80000_people_dancing_to/c6hwfhw), ""I know I've been up to[o] long when this made me cry."" I had also experienced an emotional response to it (and other large crowds) and told him as much, while linking him to a video of a Brazilian concert that elicited a similar emotion. 

&gt;&gt;Though I didn't mention it in my comment I also thought of the scene in Armageddon where Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi and the rest of the drillers are set to blast off to the asteroid and it pans around the entire world sending them off and wishing them a safe voyage because, but because seeing (even fictional) masses of humanity united was so moving. I used to get so damn frustrated when that silly movie used to make me cry at that scene. I created /r/happycrowds to further explore that feeling and to provide a home for all of the videos that people inundated me after my comments on the Gangnam Style thread.

&gt;2./r/HappyCrowds is a very new community

&gt;&gt;**holytryst** Before I answer, mind you) that I saw the subscriber count begin to climb and the submissions begin to pour in. I gave credit to those who originally posted in the comments of those videos. So, both the initial reaction and the sustained response have been a pleasant surprise. 

&gt;&gt;Then again

&gt;3./u/HolyTryst

&gt;&gt;**holytryst** Speaking of /r/uplifitingnews, aroused it made him. I occasionally have to approve a link that gets caught in the spam filter, but thanks to the modqueue on [reddit is fun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit) I can manage that quite easily with my phone. Again though, I imagine the ease in moderating is due to its relative size and particular content matter. 

&gt;&gt;That said, the mod of /r/MakeMeSmile, who said that he modded the most active users in the subreddit, given that they were likely to be the most passionate and know what would make a good post.

&gt;4.I saw in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/happycrowds/comments/1103ki/best_new_subreddit/) that you all are working towards maintaining diversity in the types of happy crowds posted. What are your rules for happy crowd-posting right now?

&gt;&gt;**holytryst**To be quite frank

&gt;&gt;As of right now, but I am fascinated with videos that skirt that line. You can see some of my comments on that issue here. 

&gt;5.Show me your favorite video of a happy crowd!

&gt;&gt;**holytryst** The first is currently the top post of all time on the subreddit and my final impetus that made me create the subreddit. It is singer Lara Fabian singing in French to an audience that sings over her in the sweetest way possible. 

&gt;&gt;You can see [the post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/happycrowds/comments/10zhlr/lara_fabian_je_taime_live_in_concert_crowd_sings/)

&gt;&gt;The second is also from /u/mulletarian (who will likely be someone I will ask to help mod if it comes to it) and is a Russian fiddle player who interrupts a Dave Brubeck solo piano improv to jam with him. The look on Dave's face when he hears the strings is amazing. The [post is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/happycrowds/comments/10zjn0/dave_brubeck_with_young_russian_violinist_wait/) and the [direct link to Youtube is here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceiDpI_ZabA). 

&gt;&gt;And third, ""Natarseen, natarseen, ma hameh ba ham hasteem!"" that for awhile became a rallying crying of the election fraud protesters. It means, ""Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, we are all in this together!"" I'm sure the effect is somewhat diminished if you don't know Farsi and/or the background of the election, they go on to chant

&gt;&gt;I can't seem to find one that I saw at the time where the crowd protected riot police from being beaten while chanting the same thing. I wish I could find it as that is a much better video than the above; if anyone who sees this is willing to give finding it a try

&gt;6.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**holytryst** I am blown away at the response and how easy you have made the moderation process. Everyone has been polite, comments, or posts. I appreciate each and every one. 

&gt;&gt;However, really) to even [promoting the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/10zk91/psa_rhappycrowds_now_in_effect/) without any prompting from me. I really appreciate all of their and the other user's efforts in making the subreddit be a place to share videos of united masses of humanity.

I'm not shy about my ridiculous obsession with middle earth. I remember being a toddler and my father reading The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to me before bed. If you google “Lord of the Reefs” you'll get a 15 minute video of my friends and me recreating Return of the King line for line, I wanted to feature /r/TheHobbit so that others could revel in Tolkien's glory like I have all my life. 

/r/TheHobbit is a great subreddit. With a pretty equal amount of movie updates as well as discussions of the novel. There are people in this sub that make my obsession seem almost sane. Almost. 

The users are always very kind, to the most ridiculously specific minute details of the The Hobbit. 

And now, have been waiting for this since 2003, when Return of the King first premiered. And with only a couple months to go until the An Unexpected Journey's release, I couldn't think of a better time to feature this subreddit. 


&gt;##1. What inspired you to create r/TheHobbit?   
     
&gt;&gt;**Alyeska2112**: Like countless others around the world, but The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings definitely rank among them. When I saw that no one had yet created a subreddit specifically for The Hobbit, I knew it presented a great opportunity, especially with the new films set to premier.
    

&gt;##2.  What should people expect to find on your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Alyeska2112**: A real community, lifelong fans, it's really inspiring to go back over the book and see how much you know. It's great to chat with others about one of your favorite subjects, and see what other peoples' experiences with the book have been.  

&gt;&gt;**travelinghobbit**: I like to think we're a big group of geeky fans. Doesn't matter if you've read the books a million times, share and discover Tolkien.
   
&gt;##3. Be honest. Can you name all of the dwarves from memory?

&gt;&gt;**Alyeska2112**: Okay, Kili, Fili, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Oin, Dwalin
   
&gt;&gt;**travelinghobbit**: *cracks knuckles* Dori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Dwalin


&gt;##4. What do you think of the decision to make The Hobbit into a three movie series? 

&gt;&gt;**Alyeska2112**: Peter Jackson has spelled out pretty well his intentions for the separate films, but will also let him flesh out the ideas Tolkien refers to (the Necromancer, the White Council, Radagast, etc.). Besides, he could make a dozen of these, and as long as they're as brilliant as the LoTR trilogy
    
&gt;&gt;**travelinghobbit**: I have complete faith in Peter Jackson and the others involved. I was miffed a bit at first when watching LotR at some of the changes


&gt;##5. What's your favorite aspect of The Hobbit


&gt;&gt;**Alyeska2112**:  The quiet nature of it. The films are beautiful and exciting and funny in their own way, and used them like a world class chef - only the right ingredients, in only the right amounts. Tolkien was economical at times, expansive at others, but always used just the right words and lyrical descriptiveness for the moment. He didn't just usher in high fantasy, he was a peerless writer.
    
&gt;&gt;**travelinghobbit**: When I pick up my copy of The Hobbit, the character of Bilbo is very relatable. Who hasn't felt like they've been thrown in the thick of it without knowing what to do? Seeing him grow and take leadership is wonderful and makes you think you can face your own hardships.

&gt;##6. Do you guys ever discuss any of Tolkien's other works?

&gt;&gt;**Alyeska2112**: We definitely talk about Tolkien's other works, we're like /r/tolkienfans or /r/lotr. But we always tend to come back around to what Mr. Baggins and the Dwarves are up to.

&gt;##7. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

&gt;&gt;**Alyeska2112**: Simply put, have really created something special with it - which is appropriate, since they both live in New Zealand! Other excellent Hobbits like nitesmoke and skulburn have also contributed greatly. In other words, it's a truly worthwhile subreddit because of the hard work and creativity of others. Without them, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting.
    
&gt;&gt;**travelinghobbit**: I wish I could find some pithy quotation from the book for you

If you dont know /r/ImaginaryMonsters and you will see the name of the subreddit for the first time
This is partially untrue
You see, story telling or just [breath taking](http://www.etsy.com/listing/46738382/star-wars-darth-vader-pop-art-style-fan)(get it?). 'Monsters' is one of these subthemes, and /r/ImaginaryMonsters provides that kind of art. 
Beautiful creations

It fascinates me how these artists can come up with such vivid imagination. Every artist has his/her own style which makes every monster special. Even if they are from the same 'species'. 
One thing /r/ImaginaryMonsters teaches you is this: Monsters can be beautiful too.

The kind of monsters which scares, suddenly something like [this](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs26/f/2008/033/7/e/Sea_Monster_by_NgJas.jpg) comes along. The back of my swimming pants would turn instantly brown. 
Yes
It is proof that you will always find a monster relating to you. It's like love on first sight. 

The posts at /r/ImaginaryMonsters are not only made by artists
It's a subreddit wich will give you fine looking monsters every day
Here is creator and mod One_Giant_Nostril

&gt;##1.How did you get involved with this subreddit? 
&gt;&gt; **One_Giant_Nostril** I got involved quite early in the process when I decided to... you know, it started a couple of hours before it's creation because I was trying to think of a name. I initially thought just the word 'Monsters' was good enough, but then I realized that people might inundate it with pictures of Hitler or Stalin or whatever. So, I needed to stress the 'pretend' or 'fake' nature of what the reddit was all about Hence the 'Imaginary' prefix. 

&gt;##2.What do you like the most about your subreddit? 
&gt;&gt; **One_Giant_Nostril** I enjoy discovering artists I haven't heard of before and their visions of creatures. Also, or their own art, so it's good to see more than the same ten or twelve submitter names over and over. 

&gt;##3.Do you support the posts which are art
&gt;&gt; **One_Giant_Nostril** The monsters don't have to be scary. As the sidebar says, drooling brutes' but also 'angels' and 'innocent-looking oddities', as well as anything in-between. 

&gt;##4.Do you have a favorite monster creation? Do you have any favorite posts?
&gt;&gt; **One_Giant_Nostril** I was astounded when I found [Mermaid Lamnidae](http://cghub.com/files/Image/193001-194000/193263/921_max.jpg) by David Gaillet (NSFW)

&gt;##5.What would you like to change about /r/ImaginaryMonsters? 
&gt;&gt; **One_Giant_Nostril** I'd like to change the header image so it doesn't crowd the text for people with small monitors or screens. But that would mean me understanding CSS which

&gt;##6.If you needed to fight 100 insane monkeys
&gt;&gt; **One_Giant_Nostril** [The Monkey King](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryMonsters/comments/vtb0l/monkey_king_by_tian_hua_xu/)

&gt;##7.Do you want to say anything to your subscribers or future subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **One_Giant_Nostril** I'd like to thank the early subscribers who believed in this reddit and supported it by clicking the Subscribe button. I'd also like to thank Administrator Erik Martin (hueypriest) [who mentioned](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/03/pimping-and-other-ways-to-find-new.html) /r/ImaginaryMonsters on reddit's official blog. That mention brought many new subscribers. But, a sure and steady hand. Also /u/EeeKitties (who created /r/ImaginaryTechnology) and /u/Riovanes (who created /r/ImaginaryCharacters). Together, and along with /r/ImaginaryLandscapes, we comprise [The Imaginary Network](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryLandscapes+ImaginaryMonsters+ImaginaryCharacters+ImaginaryTechnology) , a collection of reddits showcasing beautiful artwork by professionals and amateurs alike. Future subscribers can rest assured the artwork you will find on The Imaginary Network will remain some of the most amazing, awe-inspring, as well as head-scratching


I hope you enjoyed! Enjoy your tuesday!

[Solitary Confinement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement) is called as one of the most ultimate punishments in today's world. What is it basically ? its just a very long extended period of loneliness that is put harshly on a prisoner where he/she is not allowed to talk to anyone for a [really long period of time!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me297coOqp1r6m2leo1_500.jpg)

It is a situation which has led countless people to [commit suicide](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TJfE86TTSb4/UJDxDbFXN_I/AAAAAAAAANA/2AJXaS_M2RE/s1600/Suicide-Article1.jpg) and [commit crimes](http://bharatchugh.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bloody-scene-red-murder.jpg).

You may wonder why the hell have i featured /r/lonely in a joyous festival season .. well the answer is that remember that not everyone is lucky as you .. Many people in this world are gonna spend their christmas alone and without presents. including me since i will be in a place 9300 kms away from my home in a new place with no friends :'( So in this festival season i urge everyone to celebrate this festival by sharing the love to others and seeing that no one is left lonely :') If you see anyone who doesnt seem to have had lady luck on their side atleast smile and give a hug ... you may not understand but it may make someone really happy.

Merry Christmas everyone!

here is a small interview with the moderators

&gt;##1. What inspires/motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**absw:** The subreddit gives people a place to vent their feelings about being alone
&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem:** The general notion that there are people on Reddit that feel alone and need a safe place to talk amongst themselves and possibly (hopefully!) make some friends. Moderating /r/ForeverAlone along with /r/lonely is something that I just enjoy doing.

&gt;##2. if you ever feel lonely what do you do to fix it ?
&gt;&gt;**absw:** When I feel alone I generally like to talk to people
&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem:** Play some Halo 4 or maybe browse Reddit

&gt;##3. what msg do you want to give to your fellow redditors who feel lonely and forgotten ?
&gt;&gt;**absw:** You are not alone, jump in the IRC (Link in the sidebar at the top), there are plenty of people there that are willing to chat to you or just message me, I will talk/listen to you.  
&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem:** I'll echo what absw said

&gt;##4. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**absw:** Mainly just what I have said above, please don't hesitate to shoot us a mod mail, we want the sub to be a friendly place for you.  
&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem:** You are all awesome people and everyone feels lonely at times
Also I'd like to give a shoutout to my new subreddit /r/MLGHalo. Give it a look if you're into Competitive Halo (or even if you aren't!). You might meet a friend or two to game with! :)

I think almost everyone knows about the [eternal september](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) phenomena

I first noticed this some years ago when my parents first got email accounts

And as each of my elderly relatives, **in this, the winter of their lives,** they continue to keep these [old forwards](http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/t8q2z/fwd_dancing_baby/) circulating and filling the inboxes of unsuspecting recipients.

 A few things have changed  over the years

But what to do? We can't block Uncle Ron

Well now you can give them one last forward, as Grandma knows, even if you're having a bad day [there's always a guy having a worse one](http://i.imgur.com/lhVll.jpg).

Your forwards will be in [good hands](http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/tmc2l/fwd_fwd_fwd_fwd_photo_of_the_hands_of_god/). 

I recently talked with the mods about /r/fowardsfromgrandma at our most recent family  dinner in between just starting drinking and before drinking too much.


&gt;##1. Is there a story behind how the sub was created?

&gt;&gt; **Eduard_Khil** It started off as a dumb joke. I suggested to a few people submitting in /r/wtf that they might have better luck submitting to /r/forwardsfromgrandma instead. Some took that advice to heart

&gt;##2. Do you have any favorite posts?

&gt;&gt; **Eduard_Khil** I don't follow it much

&gt;&gt; **Meatspun** Yes. [This Monica Lewinsky](http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/12jtc1/fwd_monica/) one really captures the hackneyed

&gt;##3. What would you like newcomers to know about your sub?

&gt;&gt; **Eduard_Khil** Point your nan and granddad in our direction!

&gt;&gt; **Meatspun** This is a great place to dump material sent to them by their grandparents or older aunts or uncles. E-mails are preferred

&gt;##4. Do you get lots of forwards from elderly relatives?

&gt;&gt; **Eduard_Khil** My mom forwards me a lot of cutesy things. I post those under my main account. Only feel a little guilty about it.

&gt;&gt; **Meatspun** I've been on my aunt's mailing list for years. My uncle also sends me some. The e-mails go from my AOL inbox right to this subreddit. It's a way to cope with having sweet relatives who just happen to be racist.

&gt;##5. Is there anything you'd like to add or promote?

&gt;&gt; **Eduard_Khil** Consider volunteering at your local nursing home if you have a bit of time to spare.

&gt;&gt;According to the National Center for Health Statistics

&gt;&gt;Go for a stroll or share a meal with them. It could make a big difference in their life. Maybe yours

&gt;&gt; **Meatspun** Vote in primaries! You kids don't but your grandparents do and look what happens

Thanks Eduard_Khil and Meatspun and the subscribers of /r/forwardsfromgrandma! Now everybody let's go clean out our inboxes.

In the world of computers, /r/CableManagement.

If your idea of a nice afternoon is to rewire your tower so that the cords all hang from the sides and top, casually fixing their mistakes through a crowd process of twist-ties and clips. No, no, this isn't /r/techsupportmacgyver, you're still in the right place.

I sent the moderators of this fine establishment a few questions. Obviously enough

&gt;#1. First of all

&gt;&gt;**HH_mmm** We are just a group of guys with similar interests. When I (HH_mmm) created this sub I didn't think that it would become as big as it has. If it wasn't for the rest of the moderators

&gt;&gt;**Harpuajim25** I'm a teacher in Brooklyn

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** Well I'm a computer enthusiast that builds my own gaming PC and servers for my home. Been on Reddit for a few years now, and I also moderate /r/Nebraska, /r/MLPTunes, /r/nottheonion, and /r/SUBREDDITNAME.

&gt;#2. Cable management is a pretty big deal for many machines

&gt;&gt;**HH_mmm** Cable Management isn't for everybody

&gt;&gt;**Harpuajim25** Similar to what HH_mmm said

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** Well as the others said it helps airflow and it just looks nice. I do overclocking on my computers and other stuff, my RAM, my router, and one of my monitors. My cable management is more utilitarian though than elegant since my case, an Antec 900 isn't the best for elegant cable management.

&gt;#3. It must be answered once and for all. Pirates or ninjas?

&gt;&gt;**HH_mmm** Ninja's

&gt;&gt;**Harpuajim25** Ninjas. They are precise

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** Walruses.

&gt;#4. If you could give one piece of advice to the world

&gt;&gt;**HH_mmm** Don't be greedy

&gt;&gt;**Harpuajim25** Be patient. When cabling your computer and in life.

&gt;&gt;**Knowltey** Don't use an Antec 900 if you want decent cable management... But in all seriousness

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch for the interview

&gt;&gt;**HH_mmm** Our sub population shot up in August while we had a NZXT sponsored contest. We are talking about having a second contest in the future but no information on when yet.

&gt;&gt;**Harpuajim25** If you could throw in a shameless plug that we are planning to hold another cable management contest sometime in the not to distant future

Like nearly everyone on the internet

Some people over here at /r/SRotD know what I’m talking about here (hopefully), but for me, it was vice versa. 

Yup, with just the link to the [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/MarbleHornets/) and the words “Just watch from the beginning.” I’m glad I did. At first I didn’t know what was going on until I went on some other website (Unfiction I think...) and I finally understood, and I loved it.

The people on this subreddit will update you on when a new video, I recommend this subreddit to all Marble Hornets viewers.

&gt;##1. How did you find Marble Hornets?
&gt;&gt; **/u/Alcnaeon** I used to frequent another forum, so I sat down with some friends and we watched every entry that had been released to date, thoroughly terrifying ourselves for days to come. I was hooked.

&gt;##2. Why did you create /r/marblehornets?
&gt;&gt; **Alcnaeon** Because before I created it

&gt;##3. Do you have any interests in other Slenderman ARGs?
&gt;&gt; **Alcnaeon** I've heard there are some other good ones nowadays

&gt;##4. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **Alcnaeon** I have not been as good a mod as you guys deserve. I try and hit the mod queue pretty often, do feel free to drop me a line and we'll get that sorted out. Realizing how popular the subreddit has gotten, I'll likely be making a post soon looking for new mods, so keep an eye out for that!

A lot of you have played an mmorpg or any other online game. And in many of those games, but you will mostly find a [reliable buddy](http://i.imgur.com/1sQV5.gif). 

Until that doomsday arrives.

Maybe you forgot your password, long story short: it will result in getting separated for eternity. You (or your friend) don't see the other person anymore and you will yell [""Whats going on""?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4) 

[I'm probably making it too big](http://i.imgur.com/C3KcWXO.gif)

But lets say that doomsday does arrive and you can't communicate with that person anymore.
/r/longlostgamers gives you a last chance on finding that lost friend. Yes
The subreddit is really active and has many posts from all kind of gamers searching their lost friend. So it could be possible one of your lost friends has posted a bounty on your head. But how to find that out in such a huge pile of posts? Well

Now an interview with the kind mods /u/XeroG and /u/photo

&gt;#1. How does this subreddit work?
&gt;&gt;    **XeroG**    Longlostgamers is a open forum for you to launch your search for gamer buddies that you have fallen out of touch with. Most online gamers will be able to tell you stories about people they use to play video games with who they can no longer find due to various reasons. 

&gt;&gt;The subreddit features /u/photo 's brilliant sorting system with the most commonly searched games being color coded and sorted on the sidebar. All submissions should include the game title in brackets in the post title for easy sorting. Anyone seeing the subreddit for the first time should try using the search function to see if anyone else has submitted a post looking for your online handle. 

&gt;&gt;    **photo**    The subreddit works based on a rather basic structure in the sidebar. LLG is intended to help gamers find past friends and re-connect

&gt;#2. What is the story behind the creation of this subreddit?
&gt;&gt;    **XeroG**    The subreddit can trace its origins to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12keci/to_the_user_magnum_brown/c6vu87m?context=3). I saw the thread early in the morning and decided to make the sub real quick as a sort of passing joke. I didn't expect anything to come of it.

&gt;&gt;I left for school and when I came home that afternoon I was shocked. I had about 60-70 pms and 20-30 mod mails messages in my inbox from people who were asking various questions about the sub and offering to help moderate. I ended up enlisting the help of /u/beam1985 because of his experience modding /r/4chan. I noticed a message from the user /u/photo 

&gt;&gt;By the end of the day /r/longlostgamers had over 100 k views [(I took a screenshot)](http://imgur.com/u5NvZ) and a ton of posts. I was super excited and I was already thinking about all of the possibilities that the sub had.

&gt;&gt;    **photo**    The creation of this subreddit started with a post from /r/gaming that can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12keci/to_the_user_magnum_brown/c6vu87m?context=3)

&gt;#3.Have you ever lost a game friend? How did this happen? Have you ever found that person again?
&gt;&gt;    **XeroG**    One particular instance I can think of was falling out of touch with a whole community of GMod players. We played together on a server called Naito's Furry Trouble in Terrorist Town (I know it sounds weird but it was a fun server that didn't take itself too seriously). I probably spent close to 200 hours in game playing on that server. At some point I stopped playing so much GMod due to school and other things. When I went searching for it again I couldn't find the server and searches don't turn up much. I submitted a post on /r/longlostgamers and I am still hoping to hear back at some point!

&gt;&gt;    **photo**    I can't answer for everyone who works on the sub, and we've never been able to reconnect simply because I don't know any of their info anymore. I'd like to say that that is one of the reasons I hope to see the subreddit start to get a little more active again.

&gt;#4.Do you have any plans on expanding this subreddit?
&gt;&gt;    **XeroG**    As of right now the biggest thing the subreddit needs is more community participation. The subreddit can only be as great as the people it is made up of considering that we have already had several successes

&gt;&gt;I am still working with /u/photo on improving some of the functionality of the sidebar and the style sheets. Our biggest goal is making it easier to find fellow gamers within the framework of the Reddit format.

&gt;&gt;    **photo**    I'd love to see the subreddit expand someday. I can't say we have many plans now

&gt;#5. What is the community like?
&gt;&gt;    **XeroG**    I know I am definitely biased here but I would argue that /r/longlostgamers has one of the best communities on reddit. With the exception of one high profile incident early in the subreddit's history we have seen nothing but support and friendship between redditors.

&gt;&gt;    **photo**    For the most part

&gt;#6. Anything else you'd like to say or promote?
&gt;&gt;    **XeroG**    Go ravens!

I believe that [pizza](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EBkPS5il3sc/TAOt2UOxMpI/AAAAAAAAAEo/m1eklrmOUWA/s1600/macks-pizza.jpg) is the food of gods ..

When was the last time you had the privilege of dining this heavenly piece of soft baked circular bread with the colourful vegetable toppings which [lit up your heart](http://www.aiellospizza.com/pizza-page.jpg) and brought you to ecstasy ? When was the last time you took a slice from a pizza dripping with cheese and actually took a [bite](http://www.baciocheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image-1.jpg) and you could hear its crispness when taking bites indulged and overflowing with its heavenly smell ?

Writing these lines had me craving for a slice :D

In Neapolitan dialect the word ""piza"" was used to mean ""the way of snatching something from the hot oven"". It definitely is worthy of that name isn't it ? :D

The modern pizza was originated as you must have guessed it in the country which prides of the [leaning tower of pisa](http://www.travlang.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pisa_00.jpg), baking the bread in [different shapes](http://images.quickblogcast.com/18684-17848/mcpizza2.jpg) and other beautiful ways .. and rest assured each one melts the heart of the customers :')

I have always dreamt of the day when i will be at the top of eiffel tower eating a warm [classic margherita pizza with extra mozarella cheese](http://gwfoodjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pizza-food_C.jpg) accompanied by a lady friend where we are holding each other hands and looking into the stars ... oops i got distracted! :D But then again, a quarrel nullifier, a family/friends get-together(er)!  Offer a slice of Pizza to a person and he WILL become your friend! I know i will! :D

So i sat down with the mods of /r/pizza to have a cheesy interview with them and they had these things to say!

&gt;##1. What is your favourite pizza ?
&gt;&gt; **pizzatime:** It is proper pizzetiquette for one to say, amazing crust that is slightly crispy, but properly chewy. Goat cheese, arugula, a splash of balsamic and no sauce

&gt;&gt;A distant runner up was just discovered around the corner and is called the Loaded Baked Potato

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**BBQ Chicken or something with lots of Pineapple.

&gt;##2. Do you make pizza ? where did your love for pizza originate from ?
&gt;&gt;**pizzatime:**I do make pizza and this will send ripples down the community

&gt;&gt; I would say around '91 when I was heavy into the Ninja Turles. The trend resurged around 2006 when I actually started eating gourmet pizzas and traveling around writing the word pizza on everything. In 2007 at Bonaroo we turned Pizza into a gang and it was awesome. To be in the gang you have to know your favorite pizza place, and don't ever forget to have fun or else you get kicked out until you eat pizza again. It is not a violent gang.

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**I use to make pizzas pretty often but I recently moved into an apartment that has a very bad oven. It burns everything so I stopped using it. Ruined too many good pizzas by burning the edges :&lt;

&gt;&gt;TMNT

&gt;##3. Which is the best pizza you have ever tasted ?
&gt;&gt;**pizzatime:**Best pizza I ever tasted was on the Big Island

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**Hard to say. My tastes seem to change quite a lot and I love pizza and I love trying new things. The only way I can really answer this question is by saying something about the best pizza I've had recently which was at a local pizza shop called Pane e Vino. Their ""Mona Lisa"" is amazing but quite different from your traditional pizza. Goat cheese, arugula. Customized with additional Pineapple and chicken. It was baller to say the least.

&gt;##4. Do you have something to say to your readers and your future readers ?
&gt;&gt;**pizzatime:**I've been waiting for a proper forum for this for a while. I sat through the whole bacon craze for 5 years thinking that something was being seriously over looked. Sure, bacon fried cheese curds, pancetta simultaneously, etc.

&gt;&gt;Anyway

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**Stay golden.

Happy dining and a happy tuesday! :D

&gt;##1. How did you get involved in /r/GuessTheMovie?

&gt;&gt;**/u/relic2279** Hmm

&gt;&gt;**/u/roger_** A few years ago I participated in a few random ""guess the movie"" threads on /r/movies and thought it was a great idea for a permanent game. Hence the subreddit!

&gt;&gt;**/u/Tiny9915**  I stumbled upon this page after clicking random a few times.  I played movie trivia games all the time in college and this was the best one I've come across!

&gt;##2. Whats your favorite [GTM] so far?  I can't think of one in particular.  Its always awesome to see the random screenshots people grab.

&gt;&gt;**relic2279** I did like the theme posts (multiple movies in a single post with a specific theme) but those really don't happen anymore because of our new automated scoring system. The trade-off is worth it though. We used to have to hand count every submission

&gt;&gt;**Tiny9915**

&gt;##3. Whats your least favorite or untasteful [GTM] so far?

&gt;&gt;**relic2279** Any GTM from from the 60s or earlier. I'm absolutely horrible with older, it would be foreign cinema.

&gt;&gt;**Tiny9915** I haven't seen nearly enough older movies

&gt;##4. If you could make your subreddit a game show

&gt;&gt;**relic2279** N/A

&gt;&gt;**roger_** Not sure if that would work

&gt;&gt;**Tiny9915** I'd love to see a game show like this


&gt;##5. Tell us about your community!

&gt;&gt;**relic2279** The community is great. Lots of great players and contributors. Submissions can vary from super easy

&gt;&gt;**roger_** We aim for a friendly community and have  regulars who back to when we were founded ~3 years ago. Traffic goes up and down

&gt;&gt;**Tiny9915** All the people I've talked to and played with in this community are awesome.  They're alot of fun

It's Sunday afternoon.  You're bored and lonely.  It's been a while since you've been with anyone.  You realize you need to get your freak on (note: not a reference to /u/Freakazette

Oh

It can be a great way to meet a new fella for the day, we later discovered that we had both been in the college marching band playing sax, but in different years).

Sometimes things can get weird

---

&gt; ##What makes a post in /r/lolgrindr lol-worthy?

&gt;&gt;**miderpan** I think what makes /r/lolgrindr so lol-worthy is (like other dating/social apps) you meet some very ""interesting"" people or just get hear things or experience things that you just really need to share with other grindr (or non-grindr users)

&gt;&gt;**jbh007** What I think makes /r/lolgrindr lol worthy are the ""interesting"" conversations and profiles people post. Sometimes they provide a lot of humor

&gt; ##What have been your favorite posts?

&gt;&gt;**miderpan** I think in general

&gt;&gt;**jbh007** My personal favorite post is [this one](http://i.imgur.com/8D4Cl.jpg). It's probably one of the funniest ways I've ever seen anyone respond to an over-zealous guy.  Of course [this](http://imgur.com/a/0yFyV) is probably the best conversation I've ever read on here. *[editor's note: that link has 6 images]*

&gt; ##Please tell us about you (the mods).

&gt;&gt;**miderpan** There are currently 3 mods for the subreddit. Originally it was just me

&gt;&gt;**jbh007** First off

&gt; ##How could /r/lolgrindr be appealing to someone who doesn't use the app (or isn't a man looking for another man)?

&gt;&gt;**miderpan** I think /r/lolgrindr can be relatable for anyone of any sexual orientation because though the app is for men seeking other men

&gt;&gt;**jbh007** I think people who are not gay men can certainly relate to the facepalm worthiness of several of the posts. [This one comes to mind](http://i.imgur.com/SsPTmYf.jpg). You also do not need to be gay to understand that some people are just creepy on dating sites

&gt; ##What future developments to Grindr would you like to see to bring in extra lols?

&gt;&gt;**miderpan** From a humor aspect

&gt;&gt;**jbh007** I honestly do not think Grindr does not need to change anything to get more lols from it; everything about it (it's random anonymous guys messaging others for sex,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,t3_19kcz8

Good times

Now with you youngins' and your Xspots

GET OFF MY LAWN.

For those that do remember and cherish the good old days. There is hope. /r/PastAndPresentPics is it. Progression pics are fun but taking the same pic at a different point in time is even better. This subreddit was born to be surfed with your less used hands. But at the same time there are treasures of random pics that get me all flustered inside. Pics like this [father &amp; son](http://i.imgur.com/wCxGg.jpg)

##Interview with the mods ~~coming later in the day


&gt;1 How did PastAndPresentPics come to be?

&gt;&gt;**/u/NateTrib** I saw a cool recreated childhood photo

&gt;&gt;**/u/enfrozt** I remember Past and Present Pics back when it had very few subscribers. Like /r/Onetruegod I was browsing /r/PicRequests and I happenend to get a request to design a banner. I thought why now, and many featured pictures on /r/Pics and we got a sidebar spot.

&gt;2 What the most heart warning pic you've seen so far.

&gt;&gt;**/u/NateTrib**  It probably has to be [this one](http://i.imgur.com/7VHdv.jpg) as it is family. My three younger cousins recreated a childhood photo of mine. It put such a big smile on my face.

&gt;&gt;**/u/enfrozt** The best pic I've seen in the sub-reddit has to be this one: http://i.imgur.com/qUBrj.jpg It's the most up voted one in the subreddit

&gt;3 If there is one moment in your life that you'd wish to recreate what would that be?

&gt;&gt;**/u/NateTrib** Probably the day I was conceived. Wait... wut?

&gt;&gt;**/u/enfrozt** If there were one moment in my life


&gt;4 Where do you see PastAndPresentPics in a year?

&gt;&gt;**/u/NateTrib**  I have high hopes. I want recreating a childhood photo to be the next big thing like how planking took over. And I want our community to be the ones that made it happen!

&gt;&gt;**/u/enfrozt**  I have no idea. It's gotten so many subscribers

&gt;5 Tell us about PastAndPresentPics's community.

&gt;&gt;**/u/NateTrib** We are a friendly

&gt;What's got you excited about London's 2012 Games?

&gt;&gt;I actually know Jordyn Wieber's (current gymnastics world champion) sister from college

&gt;&gt;The excitement from Ashton Eaton setting a new Decathlon world record yesterday really amped me up for that event in a few weeks.

&gt;&gt;When I took over this subreddit it was dedicated to the 2006 Winter Games
The amount of streaming content available to watch online is going to be truly amazing. People will be able to watch many of the less popular events they've never had the opportunity to experience before.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;My Americanity is probably going to show through here

&gt;&gt;The 100M is going to be exciting with Usain Bolt running against Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay.

&gt;&gt;Instead of telling which specific events to watch though I'd rather encourage everyone to watch some of the less popular sports now that they can. Weightlifting is always awesome with the amount of power they can produce. Badminton will surprise you with its intensity

&gt;&gt;Definitely watch some of the Paralympics as well. Murderball is always a good time.

&gt;Final paragraph belongs to you

Hello, and go in another direction this Sunday. 

Although /r/ClopClop has existed for less than a year, I couldn't help but wonder how much of this reputation was deserved. 

It's with this notoriety in mind, to see where this subreddit has come from, and to see where it's going.

After the conversations I've had with the mods of Cloppit, caring about the wellness of the subreddits and its readers. And how many of the NSFW reddits we've featured so far exist for a *noble* reason?

(Totally_Not_Furry fielded our questions for this interview

&gt;How and why did y'all get involved in this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;TNF: Someone asked about putting rule 34 of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic on the main subreddit /r/MyLittlePony. The overwhelming consensus was ""NO! OH GOD NO!"" and I joked that the OP should post it in /r/ClopClop. The subreddit was then made and I quickly asked to be moderator for coming up with the name. If you notice

&gt;&gt;The main reason I stayed with the subreddit was that I wanted to keep it classy and respectful

&gt;Have you noticed any trends in the pony porn posted?

&gt;&gt;TNF: Whichever character is popular at the moment. When the Luna episode aired, there were A LOT of Fleur pics. Basically whatever was prominent that week.

&gt;I imagine there's been some controversy with the brony community over this sub. How have you responded to criticism?

&gt;&gt;TNF: By keeping the subreddit respectful, and fully supported its existence, just as long as they didn't go to it.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the cloppers of /r/ClopClop?

Welcome to Subreddit of the Day and The Parnership for a wrestlefree America.  

Here we understand that 90% of all wrestling addictions begin in their pre teen years... but there's hope

Do you think — or know someone that's watching wrestling?  Even if you believe another redditor is just “experimenting” it’s important to take action right away.  Casual watching use can quickly turn into a regular habit, and in extreme cases, procreation with other wrestling fans.  Muther.  Of.  God.

If you are at all concerned about someone who often wears his underwear outside his long underwear – you can and should intervene by:

 ||
:--|:--
Setting tighter limits with clear consequences | Having productive conversations -- remain calm
Getting outside help and support if necessary | Closely monitoring your their behavior and activities

Get them some professional help so that the healing may begin.  By abstaining from watching wrestling, a dedicated student or employee, and a more loving family member.  Sure they'll answer every question like Macho Man Savage, but you'll get used to it.

We're working together for a brighter tomorrow

It's the subreddit of the day,000 guys and gals amped up on 20th century gladiator battling - all the physicality, none of the violence.  And yes, let's just get this out of the way - when featuring a wrestling subreddit we are contractually obligated to make fun of you.  But that's the best part!  Nothing you can say about wrestling fans hasn't been said before!!  I friggin love folks who are on the periphery saying, ""I know, say what you want, but Imma keep enjoyin my source of entertainment that the in-crowd does not widely accept

So why the heckfire are we rubbin' up against [/r/SquaredCircle](/r/SquaredCircle)?  Because yesterday was the Superbowl, Octomom Nadya Suleman vs Kate Gosselin fought for custody of the other's children, and the former Wham! frontman, George Michael fought Michael Cera in the cage.  It was fantastic, or so I'm led to believe.  

So today, pants tucked into his knee high lace-up boots, an 18"" x 24"" belt buckle, and he's crying, give that guy an atta-boy back-pat &amp; whisper, ""only 364 days until next year's event"".   Then 3 forearm smashes, double axe-handle, you earned that shit.

&gt;Mazel Tov!  How long have you been a wrestling fan?

&gt;&gt;Been a wrestling fan since I was a kid

&gt;No doubt you're familiar with stereotypes associated with wrestling fans. Would you care to comment?

&gt;&gt;Wrestling fans know that wrestling is fake, is another form of entertainment. Despite the athleticism required, sports fans give so much grief, even though the only difference between this and other forms of sport is that its scripted to tell a manufactured story as opposed one that is created by natural competition.

&gt;Please tell us about WrestleMania 28. What were your expectations going into this event? How did it measure up?

&gt;&gt;Wrestlemania 28 has been building since last yeat, compared to previous years, but despite that, Wrestlemania is Wrestlemania and even the fans who criticise it the most, will always watch it, even to criticise it later.

&gt;What's the future of pro wrestling? With the addition of MMA are fan numbers dwindling?

&gt;&gt;Wrestling is growing and dwindling at the same time. The fans attracted by the ""wrestling"" are quite disappointed with the WWE as they no longer put on a proper wrestling show

&gt;&gt;However the entertainment is increasing

&gt;&gt;The popularity of MMA has dwindled somewhat compared to its intital burst on the scene. The WWE is always a spectacle

&gt;Tell me how r/askhistorians got started? Background information?
&gt;&gt; To be honest, as well as others, and the other r/Ask_____ left something to be desired. The rest of it just sort of fell into place. Took me for freaking ever to figure out how to do the tags though-- I'm not exactly a computer programmer.


&gt;Was it hard to find reliable and qualified historians? Is there a verification system you use?
&gt;&gt; Not really. The historians that have agreed to help are really the lifeblood of the community, I do appreciate their help in answering our questions! We don't actually verify any of them, but if anything happened that would make someone question their authenticity I would certainly request verification at that point. We mainly just go by the honor system.



&gt;Are there any limitations as to the kind of questions people can ask historians about history?
&gt;&gt; It has to be about history. Other than that


&gt;What has been your favorite question that has been answered on r/askhistorians?
&gt;&gt; I can't say I could pick one, I think: ""Wow, I've never considered that before, but it is a really interesting question! I wonder what the answer is..."" It's great because the answer is right there for you. One great example of this would be [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kbgfs/why_was_the_american_bison_never_domesticated/).


&gt;What can we expect in the months to come from r/askhistorians?
&gt;&gt; Hopefully more questions and more historians

&gt;Anything you want to say to your subreddit subscribers?
&gt;&gt;You are awesome


&gt;Anything else you can think of to tell us about your subreddit
&gt;&gt;No matter how ""stupid"" you are at history

So

Hope you guys and gals have a good weekend!

Good vibes

How many times has someone said this to you?

&gt;Yo dawg

Too many

Spread the word

App hookup subscribers find apps on sale (on iOS, It is a great way to promote an app. It isn't uncommon for a developer of an app to post their hookup on the subreddit to gain some attention/traction. 

The subreddit is a win-win-win.........We get free apps

If my iPhone didn't have folders to hold multiple apps

Interview with /u/reemusk and /u/Antrikshy:

&gt;##1) Is there anything you would like to say to potential new subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**reemusk:** don't think this is just an iOS subreddit. We occasionally have Android, PC, and even BlackBerry deals. The ""promo code"" process only works for iOS, but price drops are always welcome to be posted too. Help us out and find them!

&gt;&gt;**Antrikshy:** Be active! Contribute a lot of deals. As reemusk said, contribute your experience in the comments and tell other people if the app is worth getting at the discounted price or even for free.

&gt;##2) What was your inspiration for creating or becoming a moderator for /r/AppHookup?

&gt;&gt;**reemusk:** I always seen deals posted in /r/iOSGaming, etc, and I was always missing out. I went searching for other subreddits, but none were specific to this (/r/GameDeals is pretty close, and a really cool subreddit). So I created /r/AppHookup. I brought help on at around 10k users, and we've been growing since then.

&gt;&gt;**Antrikshy:** I have an interesting story. Long back when the subreddit was new, it has grown. I was only recently appointed as part of a group of mods who would reach out to developers to request them for app deals. The campaign hasn't been going well and I have stuck around. I don't have full mod powers yet (can I get them, superior mods? I'd love to moderate the sub).

&gt;##3) What has been the greatest markdown in price of any app?

&gt;&gt;**reemusk:** Adobe Ideas went from $9.99 to Free for a while. Game-wise

&gt;&gt;**Antrikshy:** Since Apple started doing their Free App of the Week thing on the App Store

&gt;##4) What is your favorite app?

&gt;&gt;**reemusk:** my favorite app right now is Feedly. My favorite app that I scored from /r/AppHookup has to be Plex. The dev team is super cool and they were the first major app to have codes posted here. I'm partial to that

&gt;&gt;**Antrikshy:** This is hard to say. Some apps look great

&gt;##5) Do you receive a lot of developers promoting their own apps? How is the relationship between the developers and yourselves/community?

&gt;&gt;**reemusk:** we have a mix of both users finding deals and developers looking for feedback/sharing their app. We'd like to get more big names involved, people really like helping people find deals (and reap that sweet karma). We wouldn't be anywhere near where we are now without the help of our user base. We love all of them!

&gt;&gt;**Antrikshy:** We have some developers come now and then. We welcome them if they want to promote their stuff, I certainly rush to /r/AppHookup to check if it has been posted.

&gt;##6) What do you enjoy most about moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**reemusk:** I personally enjoy the mod team. They are the best in the business. Quick, and always looking to better the subreddit. I also love coming to check the subreddit throughout the day to watch for great deals, just like everyone else.

&gt;&gt;**Antrikshy:** I don't have full mod powers

&gt;##7) Would you like to make any closing remarks? (Shameless plugs

&gt;&gt;**Antrikshy:** Thanks to all our users. This sub has grown well and has replaced all my app-deal-tracking sites and services. I hope to see it keep growing and eventually have a post that hits the front page (Alien Blue for iPad goes free?). 

&gt;&gt;**reemusk:** us? shameless plugs? never! well

&gt;&gt;/r/Jailbreak is a great community and my favorite subreddit to hang out in (other than AppHookup!)

&gt;&gt;/r/iOSGaming is our sister subreddit

&gt;&gt;the mod team at /r/KarmaCourt

&gt;&gt;/r/MntG crew!

&gt;&gt;As for what I'd like users to know?

&gt;&gt;We love you! You guys all rock

&gt;&gt;http://codehookup.com is a specially crafted site just for /r/AppHookup promo codes. (thanks to /u/victoknight)

&gt;&gt;Jailbreak price drops are always welcome

&gt;&gt;We really do accept any OS/platform

a community for **two years** with **7


Love them or hate them
    
So yeah
   
         
For those of you who are unfamiliar, Great Job!, Check It Out!, with Dr. Steve Brule, their movie Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie, and the hilarious Absolut Vodka commercials. Tim Heidecker is now starring in the film 'The Comedy' which is one of the weirdest and most endearing films you'll ever see (currently sitting at 82% on RT). They many celebrity cameo appearances, Paul Rudd, Rainn Wilson
    
      
      
Their humor is very hard to define. At times it's the 'so not funny
    
r/timanderic was one of the first subreddits I sought out when I joined reddit. I knew the sub was the best way to stay up to date with new projects, anything and everything T&amp;E related, it's there. Check it out, ya dingus!    
     
For your health.    
     
And with that
    

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create r/timanderic?   
     
&gt;&gt;**o85**: I asked the mod team StepPeppers and badcrumbs if I could have mod spot about a year ago. I knew the subreddit was going to blow up because of the movie and second season of Check It Out!. I felt the subreddit deserved more attention than it was getting. I did a bit of CSS work,000 subscribers when I became mod. I also did a phone interview with David Liebe Hart which dealt with issues such as drug usage on the set and other weird shit. I think that helped us grow as well.


&gt;##2. What should people expect to find on your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**o85**: Anything and everything related to Tim &amp; Eric, movies, skits, spoofs, goofs, news, whatever. It's all there. It's more than just silly dogs dancing and funny happy birthday spevs.    
   

&gt;##3. Favorite T&amp;E skit?   


&gt;&gt;**o85**: Hard to say. Off the top of my head, Pasta Bear &amp; Universe skits are also favorites of mine.    
    


&gt;##4. What was your first reaction to watching Awesome Show for the first time?    

&gt;&gt;**o85**: I absolutely hated it. I thought it was the dumbest shit I'd ever seen in my life. A few years later


&gt;##5. What were your thoughts on T&amp;E's Billion Dollar Movie?    

&gt;&gt;**o85**: It was alright. It had its moments for sure. Overall though I didn't think it was that good. I thought the other short films they've done were a lot better.


&gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

The fantasy football playoffs are coming up soon
      

       
I'm going to have to keep my write up brief
    
Two years ago, but we thought it would be a fun way to talk shit to each other, so a bunch of us got together and played.    
     
Something magical happened. We all played our hearts out. Now my friends know so much about football, it makes me teary eyed just writing this up. I love my league. I can't wait to kick their asses in the playoffs.    
     
This subreddit is run by a bunch of great guys, updates, and all the information I'll ever need to make sure my team of football players beats my friends' teams so I get to post [this picture](http://images.sodahead.com/profiles/0/0/0/9/3/8/7/3/6/spongebob-23989610449.jpeg) on each of their facebook walls. I don't say anything else, Spongebob's face says it all.    
      
     
&gt;##1. What should people expect to find on this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: Tuesday through Thursday we make predictions. Friday through Monday we complain about said predictions. We have a number of solid contributors on this subreddit who dedicate a substantial amount of time helping rookies and sharing their strategy. FFL is often a heartbreaker

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: At it's most basic, it's an awesome environment for everyone to talk about their most obsessive of hobbies.

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: You can get fantasy football news anywhere these days. We have fun discussions and there is a ton of advice to be found here from all sorts of people and different leagues. Have an IDP question? Someone here will answer it (btw

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: One of the more organized and professional subreddits out there. The main moderators spend a tremendous amount of time putting out some quality fantasy football info and in setting up a great environment.

&gt;##2. Any of you guys ever won your league?

&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: ಠ_ಠ I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: I've never won in the /r/NarFFL (official /r/fantasyfootball league), which has got to be worth something.

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: I've won my main league ($60 buy in) twice in 6 years (we are in our 7th year and I'm currently in 2nd). I've placed in 2nd or 3rd several other leagues

&gt;&gt;**moneybagels**: Unlike some people (*cough cough StruggleBunny*)

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Always in the top 1

&gt;&gt;**mookiemookie**: Won a redditor league in 2010.


&gt;##3. Biggest draft bust you've ever had?

&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: September 11th, Welker in my first live draft in my keeper league......First week, Brady tore ACL/MCL and wrecked my season 10 minutes in. I've never had another Patriot on my teams. That same year, I managed to snag Chris Johnson in the 5th round as a rookie and he's been on my keeper team (for better or worse) ever since.

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: None come to mind from the past

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: LaDanian Tomlinson

&gt;&gt;**moneybages**: Randy Moss with my first pick in 2010. Never drafting a WR in the first round ever again.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Peyton Hillis last year. The Madden curse strikes again.

&gt;&gt;**mookiemookie**: Like moneybagels
  
   
&gt;##4. Best pickup you've ever had off of the free agency?


&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: I rode Micheal Vick to the promised land in 2010 only to lose in the Superbowl by the widest of margins. Alfred Morris was a pleasant surprise this year. I manage to get blown out the first game every season without fail....it's almost a strategy now.

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: Jamaal Charles when he overtook the job. Rode him straight to the championship... he's been on my dynasty team since.

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: In 2008, Kurt Warner, by 16.44 points and I won the game by 11.99 (just confirmed the numbers in the historical league information). More recently, Alfred Morris this year. He saved my season.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Not sure about 'ever' but this year's gem has been C.J. Spiller.

&gt;&gt;**mookiemookie**: Michael Vick in 2010. Man
   

&gt;##5. Fan of the television show The League?

&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: I watch football on Thursdays. I'm a fan of Jon Lajoie but honestly don't watch a lot of sitcoms during football season. I'll probably devote a weekend to *The League* once netflix has all the seasons on streaming.

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: Absolutely. The show is hysterical

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: Yes. Yes I am. Ruxin is the best.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: More of a Game of Thrones fan. Same concept, incest and beheadings.

&gt;&gt;**mookiemookie**: It's Thursday


&gt;##6. Favorite thing about being a moderator for this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: I can honestly claim some of my very best virtual friends came from /r/ffl. We started a little fantasy league of our own back in 2009 which has blossomed into the 1500 owner strong /r/NarFFL. ManHandle, CG, Barroom, Bagels, TonyTastey, Ramstoria....I'd go to bat for these guys any day of the week.

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: Honestly

&gt;&gt;**TijuanaTacoMonster**: I love the power. It is intoxicating.

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: Deleting 30 duplicate ""OMG! DOUG 'FUCKING' MARTIN!!!1!!1"" threads after he breaks a 80 yard TD run. No really

&gt;&gt;**moneybagels**: The Official /r/fantasyfootball WDIS Accuracy Challenge that I've been running this season. It's a weekly contest for the subscribers of the subreddit where they pick the players that they think will score more points that week. (WDIS stands for Who Do I Start?). There's consistently at least 300 entries

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: The lead mods on this subreddit are talented and dedicated. I'm glad to be along for the ride.

&gt;##7. Randall Cobb


&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: Wayne and Cruz. Jennings is back this week. (start Cobb with confidence as I'm the kiss of death with predictions)

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: Cruz and Wayne this week

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: Well, the 6th worst pass defense. So they are in. Plus, Jennings coming back to Green Bay makes me a little wary of Cobb. (Written on 11/29)

&gt;&gt;**moneybagels**: [Note: I'm assuming you're asking for Week 14].
What are your scoring settings? PPR or standard? Didn't you read the sidebar? ಠ_ಠ Just kidding (but not really). I'd go with Victor Cruz and Reggie Wayne. Cruz is matched up against the porous Saints secondary and Wayne has been consistently targeted a ton all season long. Whereas Cobb might very well be pushed back in the pecking order with the return of Greg Jennings. I'd want to see how Jennings performs in Week 13 before making a decision though.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Wayne and Cruz are your go-to WR's in this group. Cobb is fantastic


&gt;##8. Who is the most frustrating player on your roster?

&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: As I mentioned in question 3

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: On both of my main teams I struggle desperately with a 2nd healthy Running Back. So more a position than a player.

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: Vernon Davis! Why do you torture me?! And the worst part is

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: RB Ryan Matthews. I took a chance with him as my 2nd round pick in two leagues and he's turned in a pedestrian performance this year.

&gt;&gt;**mookiemookie**: Vernon Davis. He's going on the ""never again"" list with Randy Moss


&gt;##9. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.

&gt;&gt;**StruggleBunny**: Thank you for shining the spotlight on our little corner of the internet. I like to think /r/fantasyfootball is a solid resource to stay on top of the ever-changing landscape of the NFL. It takes a village to make this place sing

&gt;&gt;**barroomhero**: ENVY NORTH IS BEST NORTH

&gt;&gt;**TijuanaTacoMonster**: Kaepernick is the next Fantasy Monster

&gt;&gt;**ramstoria**: There are thousands of websites that offer fantasy football news, etc. But what I think we bring to the table is good discussion between fantasy football owners. There's not going to be a lot of extolling Matthew Berry or Brandon Funston here, we're a community! It's like having your neighbor help you work on your car. Except instead of a car it's a line up of football players. And instead of your neighbor, it's some guy in a basement that may or may not be wearing pants.

&gt;&gt;**moneybagels**: Thanks to all the fantasy football nerds for making /r/fantasyfootball what it is. Thanks to /r/subredditoftheday for featuring us. Never draft a defense or kicker before the last two rounds. I love you

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: /r/Fantasyfootball is one of the more focused

73 years before The Dark Knight Rises, ideas and concepts.  I think I speak for all fans when I say that at the heart of it all lies fantastic story telling.  I've always enjoyed batman, and never completely understood it, because it's really, really clever.  I don't really need to sell you on batman, you know how awesome it is.  What I will try and get you to buy, is a subscription to /r/batman.  Here' to explain /r/batman is the one and only moderator

&gt;Can you give us your Batman fanatic credentials? 

&gt;&gt;I started collecting comics around 1990, their costumes had pouches that they never used; nevertheless, as a little kid, I thought it was amazing. I was a huge X-Men/Wolverine fan, but around that time Batman: The Animated Series started airing. Even though I stopped collecting comics when I got to high school, that show had firmly cemented Batman in my head as the epitome of all that is awesome. I got back into reading comics after college and I've been a big DC fan ever since.

&gt;Tell us about /r/batman. Your subreddit's existed for a long time... what have you seen at your subreddit over the last three years?

&gt;&gt;I created the subreddit as a bit of a joke. There were subreddits for Politics, Art, History, and I thought to myself, ""You know what people should really be discussing? Batman."" Somewhere around the time it hit 1,000 subscribers I realized that people actually did want to discuss Batman, in depth and at great length.

&gt;&gt;Over the last few years I've seen Batman news come and go in cycles. When the subreddit started The Dark Knight was just out on DVD/Blu-Ray and it felt like a movie discussion forum

&gt;You have one of the best ""Right Hand Sides"" of any subreddit I've ever seen. Did you create this or did you have help?

&gt;&gt;If you're asking about the general look of it, where should I start?"", or ""I just saw Under the Red Hood, are any of the other animated movies as great as that?"" I just kept an eye on those threads and counted which books/movies were recommended most often. A couple months ago a redditor named 'zenhic' did a survey and convinced me to expand the listings a bit more. It hasn't really stopped people from posting to ask which books/movies are the best, but those threads spawn a lot of fun debates, so I wouldn't want to stop them.

&gt;What are you expecting with the release of The Dark Knight Rises? What's the general consensus? Are you worried about the mega cast?

&gt;&gt;The general consensus seems to be 'super excited' as near as I can tell. With Christopher Nolan writing and directing you're usually in for a movie that people want to discuss and analyze endlessly afterward, use spoiler tags in comments, please please please!

&gt;Last paragraph always belongs to you. Please take a moment to send a message to your subscribers and soon to be subscribers!

&gt;&gt;I just want to say 'thank you' to everyone who posts or comments in /r/batman, and I've never had to permanently ban anyone. About the only thing I have to do is remove the occasional non-Batman-related post that makes it past the spambot, or rescue a legitimate post from the spambot. Basically, I'm saying that everything that's great about this subreddit comes from you guys, not from me, so again, thanks!

This world knows a lot of great and entertaining shows, game and film, you need to be a person who likes this kind of genre. A serie about smashing up zombies is not a treat for everyone, although The Walking Dead uses the drama, thriller and action really good. 

While you are watching the show you begin to wonder: *how would I act if I lived in the Walking Dead world?* Well

'The Walking Dead' game gives you the opportunity to answer this life changing question. Finally you can run away from your own group of zombies! No more long showers or staying up all night thinking about it!

But then you might begin to question the consequences of the game, you still play in The Walking Dead world and you will even meet some of the characters from the show! 

But it is not just some regular shoot-all-the-zombies-like-it-is-nothing game

/r/TheWalkingDeadGame is devoted to this game and is populated with real fans. You can discuss certain theories

Lukelear and I talked about the game and the subreddit, my bad. 

&gt;#1. How did you get in touch with ""The Walking Dead"" game

&gt;&gt; **lukelear** Actually, but I read up on it and decided to get Episode 1 to give it a try. I was immediately hooked - it was exactly what I was looking for.

&gt;#2. What do you like the most about the game?

&gt;&gt; **lukelear** You can have a game with as much violence and action as you want, and The Walking Dead Game has some of the best writing I've ever seen in a video game. Characters who have actual depth who you become attached to. Being able to observe the relationships between specific characters and building relationships with the characters you like the most. Being able to choose everything you say. There's so much I love about this game and I could go on and on and on, but I'll leave it at that.

&gt;#3. What can we find on this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **lukelear** This subreddit is full of die-hard fans of the game who seriously impress me all the time. People come up with some really solid theories and always make very interesting observations that make me go back into the game to see what they're talking about. In addition to that, every video you see of somebody playing it is always a little bit different.

&gt;#4. Do you watch the show too

&gt;&gt; **lukelear** I watch the show (and also read the comics.) As far as the game and the show go, and in turn, I sympathize with them. It's sort of hard for me to sympathize with a lot of characters in the show because they sometimes make decisions that don't seem logical to me at all.

&gt;#5. Looking at your 'achievements' in the game

&gt;&gt; **lukelear** I'll be the first to tell you that in my experiences playing Lee

&gt;#6. Have you learnt something from the game?

&gt;&gt; **lukelear** Video games can make you cry like a little baby. It doesn't matter who you are, and it could happen to you too, dear reader.

&gt;#7. Anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt; **lukelear** Even if you don't play video games

Research In Motion is a Canadian telecommunications company founded in 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Doug Fregin, and then went on to pioneer smartphone technology and convergent devices. Early efforts in the field of mobile push email helped [BlackBerry devices gain recognition](http://i.imgur.com/UVq5FLm.gif), and spurred copycat technologies with RIM's competitors. 

/r/[Blackberry](http://i.imgur.com/DXz2T.jpg) is a forum for users to come together to discuss problems and issues with RIM's hardware and software, has been [losing domestic marketshare](http://i.imgur.com/vyMPVn4.jpg) to [Apple and Google-powered mobile devices.](http://i.imgur.com/r6M29MD.gif) Due to the dearth of offerings by RIM over the last two years (since the release of the 9900 Bold) there is [great excitement](http://i.imgur.com/DQpAb4v.gif) on the subreddit over the new BlackBerry [Z10](http://i.imgur.com/vCmsrTd.jpg) and [~~X10~~ Q10](http://i.imgur.com/YgzC8XR.jpg) devices, along with the new BB10 operating system, set to debut January 30, 2013 at an event in New York.

I bbm'd the mods to get their take on the action.

&gt; What is your Blackberry background? Devices you have owned

&gt;&gt;**muppethead:** I've owned a Bold 9900 and a Torch 9850

&gt; What are your thoughts on the new OS and Hardware?

&gt;&gt;**muppethead:** I believe the QNX platform is one of the most secure operating systems around
I think the new Z10 gives Apple a run for its money in the product design department. The X10 series is a logical next-step for the popular Bold series. I think it captures the essence of Blackberry quite nicely

&gt; What kind of submission/comment rules does /r/blackberry enforce?

Hello SROTDers


Remember when you were a kid; you would go into the restroom and say bloody Mary multiple times to see if she would appear? You would also spend hours in the library reading about the Loch Ness Monster


About a year ago I was teaching kids guitar at the local boys and girls club and I noticed that kids would go into the theater room and turn the lights off and on while chanting “bloody mary.” Naturally being the responsible person I put a stop to it…sort of.  One day two of my students decided to play hookey and go join in the bloody Mary fun. I got one of the other counselors to cover for me while I enacted my plan.

 A day earlier I had borrowed some costume equipment from the theater department in order to make my plan a ton more effective. As the kids were calling forth Bloody Mary I snuck into the room and appeared just as they were ready to give up. I came forth from the shadows and in a creepy voice said “You have brought forth the bloodiest of Marys


My last line got me discovered. I forgot to mention that I was teaching in a real ghetto area and one of the kids came up to me and kicked me in the shin and tore off my mask


I’m not sure where I was going with this but here is r/urbanmyths.

&gt;##1. What made you all want to start r/urbanmyths?

&gt;&gt; **Titaniumtyrant**: I love urban myths, so I decided to make one, I have to thank the other mods of this subreddit though, We've accomplished a lot so far and hope to keep going.

&gt;##2. What are your favorite urban myths??

&gt;&gt; **Titaniumtyrant**: My personal favorite urban myths include, and [Slenderman](http://www.mythicalcreaturesguide.com/page/Slender+Man).

&gt;##3. What myth first sparked your interest in urban myths?

&gt;&gt; **Titaniumtyrant**: Definitely Slenderman, I made this subreddit so other people could feel that way as well.

&gt;##4. Who would win in a fight

&gt;&gt; **Titaniumtyrant**: With the Loch Ness Monsters tail whipping along with Slenderman’s Long limbs

&gt;##5. If you could have one urban myth confirmed true which one would that be and why?

&gt;&gt; **Titaniumtyrant**: Definitely Bigfoot

&gt;##6. Which urban monster scares you the most?

&gt;&gt; **Titaniumtyrant**: It would have to be [Jeff the Killer](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Jeff_The_Killer)

&gt;##7. Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of r/urbamyths?

&gt;&gt; **Titaniumtyrant**: Awesome subreddit guys

Some things defy convention and just go together *great*. Peanut butter and jelly are both condiments from two different worlds. Scientific theory held for centuries that legumes and berries simply do not go together! Yet

Romeo and Juliet's whirlwind romance defied all societal conventions, but I think ['tis better to have loved and to have committed double suicide, than never to have loved at all](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam_A.H.H.).

And of course, and the dark, stark, and cynical [Stevie Wonder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZtiJN6yiik).

Well, combo: Ponies and weed! /r/I'dLikeToBeATree combines the welcoming, mellow atmosphere of /r/trees and /r/mylittlepony.

I know some of you have been told that a place like ILTBAT will serve as a gateway to full bronyhood- but I'd like to take this moment to assuage those fears. Cartoon ponies and trees aren't for everyone

But why take my word for it? Read our interview with the mods

&gt;Why do you mod /r/IdLikeToBeATree?

&gt;&gt;RVPC/DerpyKittyHiccupTail: I like to help people and communities

&gt;&gt;reahidru: I'm the serious business guy. The level headed suit and tie. In case of emergency break Dru. I mod because I like to help any way I can so when a call went out looking for moderators I jumped at the chance.

&gt;When and why did you first get into trees? Into MLP?

&gt;&gt;DKHT: Hmmm. I got into trees via my friends. The main reason why i even tried it was because i was always on /r/trees and i was like ""Hey

&gt;&gt;I got into ponies via reddit and /b/. I used to go on /b/ a shitload in the past and was extrememly active. When ponies started to pop up honestly i was like ""What the hell is this shit?"" and shamefully joined in with the occasional trolling (Sorry!). I came off /b/ because it just turned to utter shit, helping run ILTBAT and making pony themed music alongside my usual stuff

&gt;&gt;rea: I wouldn't say I'm *into* trees. I'm an occasional ent. A were-ent of sorts. That's not to say I'm unfamiliar with the culture but I'd be doing others a disservice by saying I'm as well versed as they may be.

&gt;&gt;I first got into ponies April 2011 after seeing its popularity on /co/. I didn't watch right away but mentioned to a friend that it was a thing that did indeed exist. Said friend proceeded to investigate further and after much resistance got me to watch as well. I watched one to three episodes of S1 every night and then started watching live with episode 25.

&gt;Favorite pony. GO.

&gt;&gt;DKHT: Vinyl Scratch. I'm a DJ and producer myself and even though she has said literally nothing in the show

&gt;&gt;As for a pony that talks? Pinkie Pie. Always makes me laugh with her utterly bizzare comments and phrases :D

&gt;&gt;rea: [Applejack](http://www.reddit.com/r/Applejack) is best pony. No contest. [Seriously

&gt;&gt;[](/d11 ""Yer daaaaamn right."")

&gt;What sorts of discussions take place in your community?

&gt;&gt;DKHT: All sorts. We get posts from people who just want to steam and to get things off their chests

&gt;How did your custom mascot come to be?

&gt;&gt;DKHT: I am honestly not sure. Mods feel free to correct me on this. Basically from what i can gather the stony pony (or Sweet Leaves) originally came into popularity when hom3r added it to the emotes table on the sub. It was actually drawn by one of the shows animators and we sorta adopted it. As for Flutterhigh. I think i'm kinda to blame for that

&gt;&gt;rea: [Sweet Leaf](http://i.imgur.com/pVUzx.png) existed well before the sub was founded. We just sort of adopted her and Flutterhigh as our mascots. Now fluttershy as a pot head stems from [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1V7utCUmS8&amp;feature=related) in Episode 21. It's also where the sub's name comes from.

&gt;/r/IdLikeToBeATree is a mix of /r/Trees and /r/MyLittlePony. What aspects of each community do your try to encourage in your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;DKHT: We encourage the friendliness and the trees from /r/trees and the same from /r/mylittlepony. But replace trees with ponies :3

&gt;&gt;rea: We definitely *encourage* equal parts of both

&gt;What's the best thing about being a moderator of /r/ILTBAT?

&gt;&gt;DKHT: Best thing? I honestly cant say. Probably that i'm a direct part of the nicest community on reddit and probably the internet is up there

&gt;&gt;rea: Being a moderator has taught me so much. I've learned CSS

&gt;Do you have anything to say to all the stonies out there?

Chicago... *Mmm, of course, in German means ""A Whale's Vagina"". 

...

I'm sorry. I was trying to impress you. I don't know what ""Chicago"" means. I'll be honest

***

Before you doubters begin to question whether or not my knowledge of the *Windy Apple* is correct, or its current climate. Its subscribers will have better answers than any I can provide. Why?

Because I'm a Motor City boy

As both a native Metro-Detroiter *and* a sports fan my feelings about the Second City are mixed. On the one hand, its wonderful buildings, its pizza parlors, comedy clubs, friendly people... the list goes on. Also, as a child I always loved the movie *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* (full disclosure: as an adult I still do). So there's that.

A few days ago I put on my walking boots and began the long trek across Michigan Avenue in order to reach the mods over at /r/Chicago. It was a harrowing journey but somehow I made it there without ruining my footwear and managed to record the following interview with the friendly mods of /r/Chicago. Here it is.

***

&gt;Full disclosure: I'm a life-long Metro Detroiter so this interview might be a bit combative. I'll do my best to keep things cordial. I'll start by saying that your deep dish pizza is adequate. Your turn: please say something nice about my city.

&gt;&gt;**analogkid01**: I'm from there. :-)

&gt;&gt;**solidwhetstone**: My brother didn't die visiting your city a month back. For that I thank you.

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: Detroit is a really great place for subculture

&gt;&gt;**beam1985**: It makes Cleveland look good. But seriously

&gt;Thanks (and you're welcome!). Now to the meat of this interview: if your city is so great, Bulls, Blackhawks, and Bears suck so much? More importantly, why are all of the city's sports-fans nothing but mouth-breathing, profanity spewing assholes with absolutely no class whatsoever?

&gt;&gt;**analogkid01**: I confess I follow no sports aside from Wolverine football. However

&gt;&gt;**solidwhetstone**: Chicago sports has a long legacy of not sucking actually. Bears in 1985

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: Um the White Sox won the World Series as recently as 2005. The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010. The Bears were in the Super Bowl in 2006, Detroit? The Lions? The Pistons?? The Tigers haven't won since 84. And yeah you have the Red Wings, but what are you, Canadian? I think you guys have been living too close to Winsdor. ...The Cubs suck. But we have good reasons for that I promise.

&gt;&gt;**beam1985**: The Bulls have made the playoffs 7 out of the last 8 years. The Blackhawks made the playoffs each of the last three years and won the Stanley cup in 2010. The Bears made it to the NFC Championship game last year and are in second place in the division at 6-3. Chicago is frequently argued as the best sports city in the country. With all due respect to say the fans have no class is entirely ignorant and inaccurate. In reality they're some of the most knowledgeable and articulate sports fans out there.

&gt;Has /r/chicago organized any reddit meetups? If so

&gt;&gt;**analogkid01**: heh. You want meetups? Chicago's got 'em. I've personally hosted numerous parties since New Year's Eve last year, but yes, r/chicago has many meetups small and large. A reporter from The Daily Dot was at the first concert/party and made [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQnoa2bcg60) video afterwards.

&gt;&gt;**solidwhetstone**: We have had a host of amazing meetups. One of our moderators (Analogkid01) has done a fantastic job of hosting the biggest [/r/chicago](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago) meetups we've ever had. Recently

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: Chicago meetups are pretty much the best. analog kid has this one p. much covered.

&gt;&gt;**beam1985**: Our subreddit has a rich history of meetups! Just last month we had 2 or 3 large meetups including a Halloween costume party that had well over 100 redditors in attendance.

&gt;Chicago is one of the greatest cities in the mid-west and definitely the most populous. I've visited many times and I've always had a blast. In short

&gt;&gt;**analogkid01**: ""Only"" 11k redditors? As far as I know, but I can say this for sure: it's not quantity that counts, but quality.

&gt;&gt;**solidwhetstone**: Well- you say only but just a year ago we had a paltry 2, I think it's very likely we could surpass NYC within a few months and become #1. As for our plans for the future, I think we're just going to keep doing what we're doing: organizing great meetups, enabling people to participate in all of our great specialized subreddits (like r/chicagofood), and fostering an environment of kindness and kinship.

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: What other people have said -- we rank very well in terms of city-based subreddits. The only thing we can really do is run a good subreddit and stay focused on the community and let it build through word-of-mouth.

&gt;&gt;**beam1985**: As solidwhetstone stated r/chicago is the 2nd largest city subreddit and if I am remembering correctly also the 8th largest local subreddit. We're ecstatic about it's success and growth and strive to continue it's great relationship with Chicago redditors.

&gt;End the debate: is it the [Willis Tower or the Sears Tower?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower) For me it will always be Sears Tower

&gt;&gt;**analogkid01**: I think the reason people are so upset about the Sears/Willis issue is that it has reminded us once again how EVERYTHING can be reduced to a corporate marketing gimmick - look no further than ""U.S. Cellular Field"" as another example. As a fellow old-schooler, so it's kind of become a habit for me. Also, I suspect the name on the tower will change several more times over the course of my lifetime. So personally speaking, I'll just call it Willis, keep putting ketchup on my hot dog, and deal with the backlash as it rolls in.

&gt;&gt;**solidwhetstone**: No one here calls it the Willis Tower. It's like nails on a chalkboard. I'm going to tell my son it's the Sears Tower. Maybe we can petition them to change it back.

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: What the fuck is a Willis Tower?

&gt;&gt;**beam1985**: It'll always be the Sears Tower to us but to some it is now ""Big Black Willie"".

&gt;A subreddit based around an *actual* community must come with many challenges

&gt;&gt;**analogkid01**: Chicago's a pretty easygoing town, I say that having nothing at all to do with any of the programming going on behind the scenes (CSS, is it? Hell, I don't know). We do have two issues which come up with some regularity, one large and one small. The large issue is racism. Chicago is a notoriously segregated city, and I suspect minorities are probably even more of a minority on r/chicago than they are in real life. As a result, any time a racially-divisive issue comes up, and while that doesn't happen very often, or a subreddit just about Chicago bars

&gt;&gt;**solidwhetstone**: As with any subreddit, and there are a lot of opinions that float around on the streets. We've had to be diligent to handle that as a moderating team and I think that's gone well. We don't stifle anyone's opinions in the subreddit- but we try to lead by example and be classy in the way we deal with people. I think our subscribers have seen that and that's why they check back in every day. We get controversial content posted pretty regularly, but people know they can talk about it in the open and be expressive without fear of censorship as long as they're being respectful of people of other ethnic backgrounds.

&gt;&gt;**illuminatedwax**: The challenges just lie in the grunt work

&gt;&gt;**beam1985**: Our biggest challenge is overlooking all the posts that highlight a favorite commonality

***

My thanks to analogkid01, and beam1985 for the interview. We started as enemies, but I'd like to think we've ended as friends. Next time any of you are in the Detroit area, send me a PM. I'd be privileged to give you a tour of our crumbling remains (not really, but I do know a good burger joint you'd likely enjoy!).

Special thanks also go out to robotevil for helping moderate this awesome subreddit. All of you do great work.

This subreddit does not exist out of animals behind their computer, it's all about the memes. The good ole' fashion memes, expressing your feelings, sharing experiences, just being funny and many more. 

Many of those memes are [hilarious](http://i.imgur.com/9Bnbe8W.jpg) . Memes are the new sitcoms
But im not here to promote this subreddit. 

My mail to the mods got lost between time and space and is now floating somewhere
That's why I decided to interview a subscriber of /r/AdviceAnimals. And who is more perfect than me? No one! With this conclusion I sat down in front of a mirror and had a nice talk with the awesome /u/qweiopasd.

&gt;#1. First of all
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** Thank you! I know you did.

&gt;#2. Alright
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** Yes

&gt;#3. What is your favorite meme?
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** ""Why not Zoidberg?"" Because

&gt;#4. How did you became a subscriber? 
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** After I hit the ""subscribe"" button.

&gt;#5. AdviceAnimals has a lot of activity. How is your hair so perfect?
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** I take good care of it

&gt;#6. Would you rather start a small business with Liam Neeson or build a roof for a house?
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** Tough one. Is Neeson enthusiastic about it

&gt;#7. He is not really happy about it because it takes a lot of spare time
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** That could be a problem. Is it with him more about profit or the fun? And is the weather outisde cold or not?

&gt;#8. He really does it for the profit. He prefers to work home too. The roof is flat and the weather is late spring
&gt;&gt; **pwɘioqɒƨb** I like to work with someone who really loves the enterprise and isnt only doing it for the money. One roof on its way.

Drama. It's a force that binds reddit together and breaks its lesser folk apart. It's a driving idea behind very large subreddits, quickly filling itself with content.

Arriving in three flavors (Original, /r/drama's community is that of a majestic squid as it beats upon a tambourine. Its magic is deeply formative in the form of forms formed by a aforementioned community, mostly formed by the big ol' SubredditDrama. Form. Its moderators are ~~annoying~~ awesome, and the CSS is ~~horrible~~ *okay*. Seriously though, its content is what matters, and it's pretty good.

If this article seems rushed, I have an expectation of quality in everything I write. That's not applied today. When I rule the world[s] and you're all forced to write individual biographies of me, leave out this part. Leave out a lot of parts, actually. Like, most of it.

/r/Drama

I entered into a sexfactory with some /r/drama mods and asked them some things. I *guess* I'll give you their answers.

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**BipolarBear0** I'm 27 years old. I'm fron Denver, editing, producing, etc. I also enjoy going out into the woods for 2 solid weeks and living off the land because I'm really masochistic.

&gt;&gt;**LordUb3r** I don't have much to say about myself. Daft Punk is basically the focus of my existence right now.

&gt;&gt;**Quaxis** I am 33, lover of cats, professional train wreck, and semi-professional musician.

&gt;&gt;**TwasIWhoShotJR** I'm JR. I'm in my mid 20s, and socially unacceptable.

&gt;&gt;**ABoyNamedSu** I'm Su from the Bay Area. Long time dramanaut and expat from SRD

&gt;#2. Drama is funny

&gt;&gt;**BipolarBear0**  It's a mixture of hilarious and even more hilarious. I personally take a 'non-interventionist' approach to it - I like to watch the drama, but I really don't get my hands sticky on purpose. We also get a lot of modmails from users about the weirdest stuff - sometimes it's drama leaks, sometimes it's gore pics, sometimes they tell us to fornicate ourselves with a rusty hook

&gt;&gt;**LordUb3r** Not much, but we're mostly hands off. We get hot tips from users who don't want to post drama themselves. And every once in a while we're sent death threats and gore by a very persistent troll.

&gt;&gt;**Quaxis** It's like watching train wrecks at slow motion

&gt;&gt;**TwasIWhoShotJR** Being a mod of r/drama is totes the most amazing Reddit experience possible. Most of my time is spent making photos of things into adorably tiny flairs. There is also that guy who messages us on a daily basis saying he wants to chainsaw our heads off

&gt;&gt;**ABoyNamedSu** We mostly just laugh about the users/subs that hate us (&lt;3 u 5eva srdbroke!) or mock/ignore/ban our devoted failtrolls

&gt;&gt;A lot of our mod talk happens in IRC

&gt;#3. What's your all-time favorite drama submission?

&gt;&gt;**BipolarBear0** I have a really bad memory, as users have so lovingly termed it. It combines the best of everything - mob justice, radical feminism, miscommunication, and lame jokes.

&gt;&gt;**LordUb3r** Can I give two answers? Recently I've quite enjoyed [donglegate](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1aqnn6/big_dongle_pycon_drama_went_supercritical_adria/). My favorite drama overall has to be the [#ineedmasculismbecause trolling on twitter] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/184sem/twitter_ineedmasculismbecause_began_with_4chan/).

&gt;&gt;**Quaxis** Anything that has to do with hipsters or SJW's.

&gt;&gt;**TwasIWhoShotJR** I think the best submissions to r/drama have been our Drama Exclusive Mod Mail LeaksTM (lol), and hilarious.

&gt;&gt;**ABoyNamedSu** Hard to say

&gt;&gt;Also

&gt;#4. Off-topic quota: Favorite cartoon?

&gt;&gt;**BipolarBear0** Never been big into cartoons

&gt;&gt;**LordUb3r** If you can call it a cartoon

&gt;&gt;**Quaxis** Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

&gt;&gt;**TwasIWhoShotJR** Adventure Time

&gt;&gt;**ABoyNamedSu** Space Ghost C2C and Archer.

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch for your time. Anything else you want to say?

&gt;&gt;**BipolarBear0** Shit

&gt;&gt;**LordUb3r** We (meaning JR) just recently reimplemented flair

&gt;&gt;**Quaxis** The /r/drama mod team are some of the best and awesome people on the planet. We know how to laugh at ourselves

&gt;&gt;**TwasIWhoShotJR** /r/Drama is currently seeking out subscribers who use websites other than Reddit so that we can get some more totes-amazeballs offsite drama to gawk. So

&gt;&gt;**ABoyNamedSu** Yeah. To quote our good friend and /r/drama regular ReubenMcHawk: ""Dongs.""

There you have it. I'm surprised these guys were online at 4 in the morning to begin with

As you know scientists have provided man-kind with amazing technologies and revolutionized the way we live our lives. First it may have been by accident

With countless studies they've honed in on new and exciting discoveries. They're latest such discovery is that of comedic [sense of humor](http://i.minus.com/iexkCzlK1D0BK.gif). I just read a lengthy factitious study from a [imaginary colleague](http://i.imgur.com/VTX1Tbj.gif) of mine. In it, ""Facts are facts. [You can't explain that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=a_SLZ1xnr94#t=112s)""

Ain't that a [biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch.](http://i.imgur.com/IxbjKRZ.gif) So you know what? Why fight it? [Embrace your inner blackness](http://i.imgur.com/bEnaerw.gif) and come [join the fun.](http://i.imgur.com/FehYult.gif) Even the first rule in the side bar says so

In my closing arguement I'd like to leave you with this fine quote.

&gt; Life can be a challenge. Life can seem impossible. It’s never easy when there’s so much on the line. But you and I can make a difference. There’s a mission just for you and me.

##Interview with the funky mods is up!

&gt; 1 How did you find /r/blackpeoplegifs?

&gt;&gt;**/u/DubTeeDub** I founded blackpeoplegifs a few months ago and invited whatnow

&gt;&gt;**/u/Dickfore** Found a plug for it in some default subreddit

&gt;&gt;**/u/CmKanada** Well DubTeeDub asked if I wanted to be part of the subreddit he was going to start

&gt; 2 Whats your favorite gif so far?

&gt;&gt;**/u/DubTeeDub** [This is one of my personal favorites](http://i.minus.com/ibrQE5aE8bqqJu.gif).

&gt;&gt;**/u/Dickfore** [This](http://i.imgur.com/ZMBayCql.jpg) one came up a few days ago

&gt;&gt;**/u/CmKanada** personally it has to be [this one](http://i.imgur.com/By607XM.gif) always makes me smile

&gt; 3 Whats the best part of /r/blackpeoplegifs for you personally?

&gt;&gt;**/u/DubTeeDub** I am really amazed that this has taken off. I hardly ever post gifs anymore and the community is largely self regulating Im terms of rules enforement.

&gt;&gt; I like that most people have realized the concept of this sub

&gt;&gt;**/u/Dickfore** I get to be black.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CmKanada** I would have to say how it was just a couple people wanting to make something funny and over the top

&gt; 4 Will there ever be enough /r/blackpeoplegifs?

&gt;&gt;**/u/DubTeeDub** http://i.minus.com/im2AZRwj1jc03.gif

&gt;&gt;**/u/Dickfore** Ummm dot dot dot NO.
 
&gt;&gt;**/u/CmKanada** Well to put it short and sweet hell no.

&gt; 5 Tell us about your community?

&gt;&gt;**/u/DubTeeDub** We're just a bunch of guys who enjoy gifs of black people. That's pretty much it.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Dickfore** We are a 100% black community that enjoys black people in gif form.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CmKanada** Community of people posting gifs of black people

Welcome to the second day in our NSFW week at Subreddit of the Day.  We're celebrating our one year anniversary on reddit and as a special treat for the hard working moderators, and my hairy balls.

****

Have you ever enjoyed something, are we good with grilled cheese?  Tibet?  You know the grilled sneeze right?  Check this shit out, for years I was eating 'em with a pickle on the side. One day this lovely bird makes me a GC with the pickle in the middle!  Hot pickles in a grilled cheese?  I can only describe this experience in God units, and this was like a hundred units of the father, son and the holy toast, meleted cheese and hot pickles.  Can I get an hallelujah?!  I have been to the mountain and there's a bountiful array of clever sandwiches - all with hot pickles in the middle!

Passionx is basically the porn version of this, and for the most part, it's been pretty good.  Your digital partners have never complained about your performance, so everyone walks (limps) away pretty satisfied.  Is one porn site better than the other?  Meh, who knows.  In the great parking lot of porn, it's like a sea of cars and sometimes you can't find your ride home.  But wait!  Look at that cool ass Mini Cooper limo pulling up with a hot tub on the roof!  Aw yeah, the classiest mother fucker in the world just put your life on hold.  Step back reddit dot com

Passionx is the place for super classy coitus, give them some reason to be together and you've got the makings of passionx material.  What makes this place so good is the heavy moderation by redeto and badpeaches.  They work tirelessly to make sure the content remains at a the highest level.  Seriously, just try to submit content where the talent is less than a nine out of ten, and see how long it lasts.  They keep this place neat and tidy, and I think it's worked pretty well for them.

Today's interview, I don't think I'd get anything done either!

If any of you fine readers would like to field the questions in the comment section

1st.  What is considered passionx material? What's in and what's out?                    
2nd. Do you see passionx simply as a place to post steamy videos or something more?               
3rd. Some people disagree with NSFW subreddits based on content. To those that have a problem with subs such as yours

I started listening to electronic music round about 1992 when I finally realized that you could hear things other than Snoop Dogg and Beastie Boys. Between the rigors of high school and trying to get laid, there is always a time and a place for ""Gin and Juice"" but the first time I heard [""Papua New Guinea"" by FSOL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCoCTkC0oL0) I knew I had found something I would always love. 

Then I heard [Orbital's ""Chime""](/r/orbital) and I basically forgot everything mainstream. Maybe that isn't the right way to phrase it. Certainly my parents had no idea what the hell I was listening too, and obviously the net was not nearly the influence it currently is. So I scrimped and saved and bought some turntables (Technics 1200mk3's; top of the line at the time) and a sweet [Pioneer DJM 500 mixer.](http://www.medientechnik-hannover.com/files/djm_500.jpg) I knew that if I could practice I would eventually be the guy up there on stage playing records to thousands of [sweaty, drug-using teenagers.](http://i.imgur.com/zKBm3.jpg) So away I went. I had learned how to beatmatch on my friends set-up, blending tracks had become quite easy and it was was by far my favorite part of DJing. At the time, progressive trance was starting to become the biggest thing in electronic music, and in the area that am from, quality house and techno dj's were hard to come by. I would blend tracks by Oliver Lieb together while my friends played Armin Van Buuren and Ferry Corsten. The sappy sweetness of this type of trance started to turn my stomach.

Then I met my wife. Or the woman who would eventually become she. Born in the midwest US and knew virtually nothing about the kind of music that I was into. She liked two things: Chicago Drum and Bass and Detroit Techno. Particularly one artist by the name of [Richie Hawtin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL6BG9rdIyU). This girl would go on and on about how Richie had played amazing sets all over the world and how I had to listen to his music. I gave it a shot and while there was definitely an [initial positive reaction, I did eventually get to open for D.A.V.E. the Drummer, played with DJ Brian from Moontribe, and I had a ton of fun and opened my mind and ears to the primal, driving sounds that you can find every day on /r/techno.

So when I saw the opportunity to interview the mods of /r/techno for SRotD I jumped at the chance. Here's what happened:

&gt;What is your music/techno related background?

&gt;&gt;**DaIronchef:** Admittedly not long as some of these sages

&gt;&gt;**djscsi:** I grew up in Chicago and was fortunate to be around during the hey-day of the Midwest US rave scene (mid-90s) when techno was the dominant genre of electronic music. I started collecting vinyl in about '96, Derrick May, Jeff Mills, Ken Ishii, DJ Misjah, Dave Clarke, Frankie Bones, Terry Mullan, etc. I collected techno pretty seriously until the mid-2000s when vinyl started to fall behind digital and there was sort of a general lull in the electronic music scene in the US. I got back into it a few years ago as things picked back up.

&gt;&gt;**sp1re:** Around 1999 or so is when my appreciation for electronic music started. My brother had Crystal Method's Vegas album and I used to bump that 24/7. That CD really inspired me because I had never heard anything like that before, FSOL, and a bunch of other stuff. Eventually I started listening to trance and the Global Underground Series. This is where my interests in techno began. By looking up names on the back of those CDs, I found myself stumbling upon artists like Carl Cox, Pascal FEOS, and Green Velvet (they usually did remixes of trance tracks). Eventually I started downloading European radioshows from Napster, stuff like HR-XXL Clubnight. I went to a few raves in my highschool years but none of them were techno parties, house

&gt;What is the biggest challenge you face moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**DaIronchef:** Nothing really. The hardest thing about techno is kind of knowing techno when you hear it

&gt;&gt;**djscsi:** This subreddit pretty well polices itself. Techno is a kind of niche genre and the people who subscribe here tend to be serious ""heads"" so we don't seem to have issues with massive influxes of new users that other subreddits like /r/dubstep have seen. The only challenge I've come across is building the sidebar links and having the community come to a consensus on which artists/DJs are considered ""popular"" enough to be listed there. All things considered this was a very minor challenge.

&gt;&gt;**sp1re:** I haven't been a mod here for very long and I try not to intervene too much on what the community submits since anything that doesn't belong gets downvoted into oblivion. I was given mod status for designing our simple header design. So that's what I try to focus on

&gt;What is your favorite track? Your favorite producer? Your favorite DJ?

&gt;&gt;**DaIronchef:** While I don't particularly follow an artist as I do in some genres

&gt;&gt;**djscsi:** Really hard to pick one, on top of being a really nice guy. Historically I'd have to say that my favorite DJ is Richie Hawtin since I got to see him play many 3-4+ hour sets which ended up being very inspirational for me as a young techno DJ. And the whole Plus8 network of labels and artists made some killer music in the early to mid 90s when I was just getting into this scene.

&gt;&gt;**sp1re:** There's no way I can pick just one track. My favorite producer would probably have to be Richie Hawtin. There's plenty of other producers with amazing productions

&gt;If there was anything you would like to communicate to your subscribers what would it be?

&gt;&gt;**DaIronchef:** I say this whenever I post

&gt;&gt;**djscsi:** Post more techno. Keep it bangin'

&gt;&gt;**sp1re:** To let the newcomers know that people here aren't trying to be assholes when they downvote your submission and reply with ""NOT TECHNO"", listen to some of the higher voted posts and get a feel for why they are getting high votes. Also to our regulars, VOTE MORE! There are almost 4,000 subscribers now and rarely does anything get more than 15 votes. If you even remotely like something, upvote it!

&gt;Thank you again for joining us.  I must ask

&gt;&gt;**DecidingToBeBetter**:  In today's world

&gt;Please explain /r/RBI... what exactly is it that you do here?

&gt;&gt;**DTBB**:  Think about how cool the Reddit community can be. A person has a problem

&gt;&gt;The Reddit Bureau of Investigation attempts to tap into this spirit of helpfulness in a positive way

&gt;Can you elaborate on ""Not your personal army?""

&gt;&gt;**DTBB**:  Sometimes the power of Reddit goes negative. The ""pitchfork mob"" is the phrase sometimes attached to this phenomenon. A thread representing a good example of the problem [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mcy7l/today_i_received_nonstop_phone_calls_and_emails/). And sometimes people come to the RBI with the mentality

&gt;Any success stories you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;**DTBB**: There are a number of crimes that Reddit has helped to solve
[Link 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/phoz7/recognise_this_phone_thief/)      
[Link 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/oqmuf/can_you_help_me_find_this_tourist_i_snapped_this/)      
[Link 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n6hwo/hey_reddit_we_found_gordon/)        

&gt;&gt;Were these solved by r/RBI specifically? No. But these examples embody the spirit of the RBI.

&gt;We want to help - what do you need from us?

&gt;&gt;**DTBB**: In a perfect world, and the Reddit community as a whole would benefit. That's the dream.
We aren't quite there yet. One thing that would help right now is more subscribers interested in helping to solve crimes and mysteries. The other thing that would help is exposure. As more and more people know that the RBI exists

&gt;Can you give us some Whitney Houston closure?

&gt;&gt;**DTBB**: Imagine that you are a person who has absolutely everything a human being could desire: world-wide fame, a motion picture career and of course the wealth. Any problem imaginable can be made to disappear. Dislike what you are eating? Hire a new chef. Troubled by weight gain? Employ a personal trainer. Upset by the current climate? Travel anywhere in the world. Want to meet somebody? Anyone will gladly take your call. You have the name recognition, connections and resources to do anything you can imagine. What more could you want?

&gt;&gt;Yet how many times have we seen people implode in this situation? We must ask: why is it so common for people, as suggested by [this short video](http://youtu.be/xoTzTFUZblY). It could be that the process of hyper-schadenfreude that the famous experience, where any mistake, any misstep is criticized so caustically from a thousand angles, rips into the soul. In his [Actors Studio interview](http://youtu.be/84NjYRTHpfU), Dave Chapelle talks openly about the problem with Hollywood (see 34:00, 48:00). ""You can't get unfamous

&gt;&gt;Closure? Perhaps the solution might be to create a society less obsessed with celebrity and at the same time less caustic. Perhaps the solution might be a network of support that helps people when they make a mistake

I'm here with the creator and mod of r/RAoBs [**rubes6**](/user/rubes6). Who is nothing short but an extraordinaire and gentleman to say the least.

&gt; Why did you create [r/Random_Acts_of_Books?](/r/Random_Acts_of_Books)

After making the post, a lot of people told me to start the subreddit, and other people made offers in the thread to buy books as well (the 4-year old girl ended up getting a few offers for her superhero-themed party! Awesome). Some people said to just go to their local library, but I personally feel there is a certain pride to own your own books and admire your bookshelf (no, I don't own a [kindle](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=133141011 ""Jaxspider here, I like to show my books off

&gt;&gt;  Top 10 books in no particular order... East of Eden, Fahrenheit 451, The Brothers Karamazov, The Black Swan, The Omnivore's Dilemma, The Road, The Elegant Universe, by Aldous Huxley

&gt; If there is one book every man
&gt;&gt; Maybe the book The Slight Edge. It's sort of self-helpy, but these things add up over time to shape who we are. Similarly, exercise isn't going to make us immediately thin, but over time, these habits add up. Eating healthy and exercising can be easy to do, but it's just as easy not to do. Despite the common mentality of a world where payoffs for exercise should be instant, in reality their not

&gt; Where do you see r/RAoB going in the future?
&gt;&gt; More members, or once every two months (under $10 on Amazon or wherever), and we multiply this by a couple thousand redditors helping out other redditors who may only be able to afford necessities, WOW, that just brings a smile to my face thinking of the reading that could be done! Society in general is reading less and less these days with the [internet](http://www.reddit.com ""Jaxspider here again, I kid, I kid. You know I &lt;3 you reddit."") hogging and dwindling their attention spans

&gt; Tell us a little about your community? What makes them so special?

I'm here with **MediaMoguls** the creator of /r/ForHire. Here is the Q&amp;A.

&gt;##1. Whats made you start / join /r/forhire? Whats the background story?

&gt;&gt; I created /r/forhire a couple years back, ""some redditors are skilled professionals, some redditors need skilled professionals.""
Reddit actually launched a [more traditional job board](http://redditjobs.com/) shortly thereafter, and super lightweight.

&gt;##2. Do you know how many people actually have gotten hired? Do people come back and tell you? They should.

&gt;&gt;We can't really track hires, [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/jy5q6/for_hire_need_redditor_to_create_300x100_banner/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/fa3hb/hiring_someone_to_create_10_house_ads_for_reddit/)), and of course the guy who offered money for someone to [dance around in a gorilla costume to a song he liked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/g9ado/hiring_film_yourself_in_a_gorilla_costume_dancing/)

&gt;##3. Tell us some benefits for using /r/forhire instead of some other website?

&gt;&gt; Follow the rules in the sidebar and you'll be fine. Also

&gt;&gt; I've always said that all are job offers are welcome.. yard work, whatever you're looking for. That said, most of the gigs that are posted are one-off design/coding/IT gigs, which are successful because of reddit's demographic.

&gt;##4. What are some tips/secrets looking for a job show know by heart?

&gt;&gt; As tough as it may seem to find a job today

&gt;&gt; The world is a different place now,2391197,00.asp) What do you want that person to find... your beer bong pictures on facebook? I have heard from recruiters that say ""if you're not on LinkedIn, you don't exist.""

&gt;##5. Tell us about the community.

&gt;&gt; The community is great. A lot of the communication between posters and commenters happens via PM (since people don't want to post contact info publicly)

Facebook is pretty much infamous for being a website with a lot of dumb people on it who post poorly photoshopped pictures to make themselves look cool, half of them aren’t) because they think Facebook likes are *so* important. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg, beneath the surface some amazingly smart people are on there, and this subreddit has heaps of them.

I know, but under all the stupidity that rids the website it’s hard to find all the hidden gems that actually *deserve* your attention. That’s where /r/facebookwins comes in.

&gt;&gt;**harpertown** Hi, yesterday on our subreddit, I made a few comments that some considered to be racist and offensive. If I did offend you, I deeply apologize from the bottom of my heart. What I was simply trying to do was make a joke over the fact that white women generally don't have sex with black men. It was simply a joke, and the joke got out of hand, because in this situation it was true. People were offended. It doesn't matter what type of baby you have whether it be white, black, the important thing here, whether it be a white child or a black child, as not to offend people. Black people

&gt;&gt;**DarkSkyz** [Yes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoW9czgQBqE)

&gt;&gt;**over8000** nothing in particular comes to mind atm.

My grandmother always used to tell me fairy tales when I visited her

A lot of classic fairy tales are traced back to the Grimm brothers. These ol'buddies made stories with morals


But this subreddit isn't devoted to the Grimm brothers or their fairy tales

Here is a little summary of Grimm from /r/Grimm:

&gt;Nick Burkhardt, learns that he is a descendant of a group of hunters known as ""Grimms,"" who fight to keep humanity safe from the supernatural creatures of the world. Upon learning of his destiny, he struggles to protect humanity from the sinister storybook characters that have infiltrated the real world

This may sound like a really cheap and bad serie
This subreddit may seem like one of all the other serie or movie focused subreddits

So, try it out!

&gt;#1. How did you get into Grimm?
&gt;&gt; **konkedas** It was one of those shows that people had been telling me about for a while but, I decided to get the first season and start watching. I've been obsessed with Monroe ever since. :P

&gt;#2. What made you keep watching the show?
&gt;&gt; **konkedas** I remember watching the first few episodes thinking that I probably wouldn't keep watching the show because the story, effects, etc seemed very low budget and uninteresting, but I gave it a chance and it quickly picked up in quality! The stories have gotten great, the long arch ""big"" story mixed with the episode-to episode stories really pulled me in, the characters really started to shine. It is very easy to connect with Hank, Monroe

&gt;#3. Who is your favorite character and what is your favorite wesen?
&gt;&gt; **konkedas** We had a small survey recently, it's safe to say that Monroe is hugely popular and it's not hard to understand why. He's the perfect middle man between Nick and the Wesen, he's smart when he needs to be, funny when the moment calls and he likes long walks on the beach... err... never mind. In that vein, the Blutbad are my favorite wesen, but Hexenbiest are certainly pretty badass looking. They would serve well in their own horror movie, ""Mama"" style.

&gt;#4. If you needed to become a wesen
&gt;&gt; **konkedas** Personally? I'd like think I would become a Dämonfeuer

&gt;#5. What is your favorite episode?
&gt;&gt; **konkedas** When I made the poll, and I can safely say (along with quite a few of my fellow Wesen on /r/Grimm) that La Llorona (S02E09) was an absolutely fantastic episode. I won't give anything away for those that haven't seen it, but it really was a fantastic episode and a highlight of the entire series.

&gt;#6. How is the community like?
&gt;&gt; **konkedas** How is the community like?: Everyone is great. In my time as mod

&gt;#7. Anything you would like to say to current or future subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **konkedas** Give the show and the subreddit a chance! I know things may seem slow on both mediums to start with but

*It is very important that you follow the rules on every featured subreddit. /r/Grimm included.*

----------------------

Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?!
Not me

 
But it is a magic filled television show. When I worked at a local Boys &amp; Girls Club I had the task of taking care of hordes of children hopped up on chocolate. These kids made homeless people on PCP seem calm. The only thing that would calm them down (regardless of age) was spongebob. I would pop in a spongebob DVD and not have to “work” all day. These kids’ eyes would be glued to the television (and mine as well).
My mind is blown knowing that they only have this minimal amount of subscribers. Without any further text here is my interview with the subreddit creator /u/dysxqer.


&gt;##1. What made you all want to start /r/spongebob?


&gt;&gt; **dysxqer**: During a FIRST Robotics session at my high school, I hopped on reddit. That particular day, we had been reminiscing about old TV shows, music, etc. Spongebob had come up as a main topic, so while browsing reddit, I decided to search and see if a Spongebob subreddit had been created. To my surprise, but due to the overwhelming popularity of Spongebob itself, videos, our subscribers and traffic have increased exponentially. I couldn't be happier that what turned out as a small idea turned into a legitimate

&gt;##2. What are your favorite spongebob episodes?

&gt;&gt; **dysxqer**: ""Help Wanted"" will always stand out as my favorite. The first Spongebob episode ever released, he was young, naive, and always motivated. While Mr. Krabs sets up an impossible task, the innocent Spongebob actually follows Mr. Krabs wishes and shows he actually has true talents to go along with his high motivation.
""Pizza Delivery"" and ""Krusty Krab Training Video"" also hold special places in my heart.

&gt;##3. If you could be one character of spongebob who would you be?

&gt;&gt; **dysxqer**: I couldn't be anyone besides the main character himself - that is

&gt;##4. If you could have any other show crossover to spongebob which show would it be?

&gt;&gt; **dysxqer**: You know how shows like ""The Three Stooges"" and others had crossovers into the 60's Scooby Doo universe? I would like to see Spongebob in an old-fashioned Scooby Doo mystery. Patrick would fit in perfectly with Shaggy and Scooby

&gt;##5. Would you rather eat a krabby patty or have $5 in bubble money?

&gt;&gt; **dysxqer**: I think everyone would agree that a Krabby Patty looks like one of the tastiest things ever animated. I would love to try one! I don't trust myself to handle bubble money...


&gt;##6. Do you think spongebob has gone downhill since the original showrunner quit?

&gt;&gt; **dysxqer**: 100% yes. In my opinion, creative, and a fun friend. He's turned into a complete idiot, making stupid decisions and saying stupid things for the sake of making the audience laugh because he's stupid. Patrick has always been dull, but he's become borderline mentally retarded. Overall, the slap-stick humor has disappeared and the stupidity is on the rise, which is a childish kind of humor that appeals to people who weren't the initial followers of Spongebob.

&gt;##7. Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/spongebob?


&gt;&gt; **dysxqer**: To everyone: Thanks for sending in all your nostalgic pictures and videos! Literally
To /u/f141998: Thanks for being the only useful mod on our mod team, and awesome flair for our users.

After last week's [double](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/qvzss/march_14_2012_rdataisbeautiful_stats_graphs/) || [whammy](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/qxjnw/march_15_2012_rkarmaconspiracy_what_will_zach/) featurettes, I start searching for hours. Neither of which things happened yesterday. So I hit the super secret [random button.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) (but for real, here is the link to the real random [button](http://alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/troll-realism-troll-l.png)) and got nothing... So I kept hitting it... over and over and over again. I was going mad for minutes on end opening multiple random tabs and finding either nothing worth writing home to me Ma about or things I've already [featured.](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/search?q=jaxspider&amp;restrict_sr=on) Just a drag, for reals yo. Then like the asteroid that killed all the dinosaurs it hit me, why don't I just make a subreddit and feature [that?](/r/HumanPorn). Nah, that wouldn't be cool. And I'm very cool. So cool Mr Freeze constantly worries about it, often times suggesting to me

* Late for work
* Never pay the bills on time. ✓
* Jaywalk at every chance. ✓
* Never post a featurette on time. ✓
* Wear mismatching socks. ✓
* Love wearing white after Labor day. ✓

I make loose cannons like [this](http://i.imgur.com/IywU8.jpg) bum look like [JD from Scrubs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ktdm5/i_ama_zach_braff/). Yeah, what /u/zachinoz? I called you out, what you gonna do about it? Write a song with your chocolate bear friend about it? A friendship which I totally envy yet refuse to admit with my IRL friends.

~~**Interview is on the way folks. Or did I plan to delay it?**~~

###The interview with sgt_shizzles is up. I'm such a badass like that.

&gt;## 1. How did [r/FWA](/r/FirstWorldAnarchists) start? What was the weird silly law that broke the proverbial camel's back?

&gt;&gt; The subreddit started as a joke following [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kkyju/my_dad_is_a_bit_of_a_rebel/c2l3y9j). Honestly I didn't think it would last very long

&gt;## 2. What is your favorite post so far? Why is it so? (If possible)

&gt;&gt; If I absolutely had to pick a best submission so far it would be [Trash Can Assassin](http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/r2izr/there_comes_a_time_when_even_the_most_decent_god/). The fact that it's animated really helps to convey the quietly revolutionary attitude that we all celebrate here.

&gt;## 3. What makes [r/FWA](/r/FirstWorldAnarchists) special

&gt;&gt; I think the best part about [r/FWA](/r/FirstWorldAnarchists) is the sense of brotherhood created by a shared cause of tongue-in-cheek rebellion. We've all spent our lives being ordered around by ketchup packets and standardized testing forms, I fell in love with it. I'm working on a properly vectorized version right now, as well as a CSS overhaul for the rest of the subreddit.

&gt;## 4. Where would you like to see [r/FWA](/r/FirstWorldAnarchists) in a year from now go? Is there a master plan?

&gt;&gt; I feel like I have no say in where this subreddit goes from here, and there never really was. I can't take any credit for this awesome community; I'm just thrilled to be a part of it.

&gt;## 5. Anything you'd like to add? 

&gt;&gt; Fuck the Police.

Only **385** postcard fanatics for **3 years**.

Reddit. what a wonderful website you are. For some, /r/askscience &amp; /r/DepthHub. The most wonderful thing about reddit is that it allows us to create communities at a drop of a hat. From /r/GentlemanBoners to /r/EarthPorn, from /r/StarWars to /r/Futurology, from /r/Ghibli to /r/GameOfThrones, from /r/Murica to /r/Ameristralia. And everything thing in between.

Just like the [hair club for men's president](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuRLGdGnqSU)

Here is a the kicker. If you send a postcard with your username. They'll give you reddit gold for a month. Just don't try to game them. They are way smarter than you think they are. Give them some credit. They did make reddit after all. So go over there and take a gander at some postcards. I assure you

&gt; Why postcards why not coffee cups or other collectible items?

&gt;&gt; **powerlanguage** We love legacy communications.  It is also awesome to see where [our users come from](http://www.reddit.com/about/postcards/view/1302/front).

&gt; What is your favorite postcard? Why? Can we see it?

&gt;&gt; **powerlanguage** There are so many good ones it is hard to choose.  Some that come to mind are:

&gt;&gt; * [valuing the tactile experience](http://www.reddit.com/about/postcards/view/149/back)
* [reappropriated stationery is always welcome](http://www.reddit.com/about/postcards/view/303/front)
* [the postal service disregards your vistas](http://www.reddit.com/about/postcards/view/875/front)
* [fedex sent usps?](http://www.reddit.com/about/postcards/view/897/back)
* [no explanation needed](http://www.reddit.com/about/postcards/view/2296/front)
* [right in the feels](http://www.reddit.com/about/postcards/view/2164/back)

&gt; Have you guys ever received a postcard so weird / creepy you couldn't share it?

&gt;&gt; **powerlanguage** Not to my knowledge.  There is a surprising wide-spread aversion to snail mail in the reddit office (no one wants to touch it, his favorite snack, so we can watch him be tormented.

&gt;  It says you guys have gotten over 2000 postcards... where do you put them all?

&gt;&gt; **powerlanguage** The postcards currently adorn the walls in the aptly named ‘postcard room’ at reddit HQ in San Francisco.  [Check out a video of them being arranged](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_K3xoGMPl8).  I'd estimate this is less than half of all the postcards we have received.  The rest are piling up in a box by my desk

&gt;  Any funny stories related to a postcard?

Almost everybody has had something weird and unexplained happen to them.  There are those who say they haven’t, in their mind, to explain what happened to them, so it must be a dream.  Or an hallucination.

Anything is better than paranormal activity actually happening.

I once lived in a neighborhood where things like this happened to everyone on a regular basis.  We accepted it.  We didn’t know what caused it, mostly.  One time, it was the radio.

Even now, I hear giggling voices.  At first, I thought it was the children.  Two 2-year-olds live here, and I thought they might be waking up in the night and having a laugh.  Then, one day this past weekend, I was the only one home, and at 2 am

/r/Paranormal is a subreddit dedicated to discussing the paranormal.  Those weird and creepy things that are happening to you that you think no one else will understand?  These people are truly interested in your experience.  Have you merely just seen a good documentary on paranormal activity?  Discuss it with them.  No longer do you have to accept insanity if you don’t wish to.

I contacted the mods of /r/paranormal to ask them about their own experiences.  As a surprise to their subscribers

&gt;#1. What made you decide to become a mod for /r/paranormal?

&gt;&gt;**thumb22** About two years ago, and in the time since we've brought it from 2k subscribers to 23k.

&gt;#2. What is the strangest thing that has happened to you

&gt;&gt;**frenzytest** I've had premonitions of deaths, in the best way possible, to be extra careful and look out, not to talk to strangers and to just trust me on it. Come to find out a few months later a man was stalking her on her walk from the bus stop. She is now 15 and gets off the bus directly at her grandmother's house to avoid any possible danger. Some people would say these premonitions are just coincidence, but honestly I can tell the difference between a regular dream and a premonition. They have a different weight about them. And they're never consistent. I haven't had one in a long time, but for awhile I had one every other week or so. So, I really don't have an explanation.

&gt;#3. What is the creepiest thing you have heard of happening to someone else?

&gt;&gt;**svenly1** I investigated with some friends for awhile, I was on the first floor of the house, and he was in the attic. I heard a loud BOOM and him hightailing it out of the attic. It turned out his flashlight had gone out, and he felt something get very close to his ear and whisper 'you're coming next'.

&gt;#4. Tell me more about paranormal investigation.  Are there any big names in the field

&gt;&gt;**senjutsuka** Paranormal investigation is relatively limited and strikes me more as something people do for kicks. It's valuable in so much as driving interest and pushing forward evidence but is limited long term for individual development or actual understanding of the meta reasoning behind what is being experienced. Read some books by Dion Fortune

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**thumb22** We're really happy to be selected as subreddit of the day

At 7:00AM

GRRRRRDDDDMMMMMMMM. 
CRRRHHHHHHHHH. 

I walk into my bathroom and stand over the toilet. Hand on the wall beside me. 
Those are always the best pisses

The ruckus was coming from right below the porcelain fixture. It made my head pound, noxious noise that made me surprisingly nauseous. 

""This is what I get for renting a shitty apartment on the north side of town"", eggs. I do have a box of hamburger helper in the cabinet, but the recipe just isn't quite the same without ground beef. 

The sounds from the bathroom related repair work incessantly droned on for the next 30-45 mins. 

I had just sat down to smoke a bowl and watch Reno 911 when there was a loud knock at the door. The knock was hard and abrasive. Still in my underwear

Maybe the main character will turn out to be a super hero. Or maybe a draft dodging leftist who get's slingshoted into the war.

Today I decided to feature /r/cosplay. I myself have never participated in cosplay/com-con culture

The costumes can be ridiculous. Like I know people who like spending money/time/effort into costumes for halloween but this is some next level shit. The gamut spans from silly to serious

Best case scenario: You like cosplay and you didn't know about this subreddit and now you do!

Worst case scenario: You don't like cosplay

Hope you enjoyed reading

When we step back and analyze the subreddits we've featured, Pat!  We at Subreddit of the Day, (a handsome group of men and women who finally memorized the lyrics to [Peaches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvcohzJvviQ)), completely understand and embrace this conundrum - how can we possibly serve up *homeruns* every single day?  Is it possible to feature subreddits that appeal to everyone?  Does the Pope shit in the woods?

Clearly, one about internet pictures, et cetera.  Hopefully we've given you a good sample of what reddit has to offer in a way that keeps you comin' back!

Welcome to today's spotlight

Before we begin, but there's also [/r/snowboarding](/r/snowboarding), [/r/AggressiveInline](/r/AggressiveInline), and don't forget [/r/shreddit](/r/shreddit)!  So confusing!  But what's easy to understand is the appeal this subreddit has.  The posts are absolutely hypnotic!  This is one of those subreddits where you could lose 30 minutes easily just going through the incredible content.  I'm hooked on the videos, but that's just because I have zero skateboarding knowledge.  If you do know much about skateboarding, you're in for a hell of a ride!

[/r/skateboarding](/r/skateboarding) is a perfect fit for subreddit of the day because it has great content, and it's incredibly active.  We salute you, /r/skateboarding, for making reddit.com a better place.  Here to discuss the site is *meltmyface*, super moderator.

&gt;Please explain /r/skateboarding in your own words. Give us an overview of what we'll find there.

&gt;&gt;All things skateboarding. Freestyle, videos, pics, humor, nostalgia, and advice.

&gt;Skateboarding is a sport where the majority of people are young males. You could say the same for reddit (pretty much). So how is /r/skateboarding going?

&gt;&gt;r/skateboarding continues to grow steadily without any effort. Allowing the subs to moderate themselves seems to be the best way to let this community thrive. I don't have to do anything but clear out the spam filter every once in a while. For the most part everyone is civil and the ones who aren't just get downvoted. It's definitely one of the more civilized subreddits that I've experienced.

&gt;For the non-skaters among us

&gt;&gt;I'd say the greatest appeal of skateboarding is the individuality. You don't have to train, work with a team, or rely on anyone. Skateboarding is whatever you make it. It's not only physically demanding, but it is also a form of self expression. Creativity is what gives skateboarding life.

&gt;What is the [Shreddit project](http://www.reddit.com/r/shredditproject/)?

&gt;&gt;The Shreddit project is a montage of Shredditors' skate footage. It is currently in-the-works.

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to say to your subscribers? Anything you'd like to say to those who may be visiting for the first time?

&gt;&gt;To the subscribers? Go skate. First timers? Just have fun

Its simple we ~~kill~~ watch the *Batman*. Okay I'm going to be honest with you folks, its a subreddit where people posts pictures of ~~Garfield~~ cats? In the same fashion, ~~breakfast club~~ /r/movieclub being so simple yet unnoticed till right this ~~Gone in 60 seconds~~ second by me has fewer than ~~300~~ 5000 subscribers. Its just ~~idiocracy~~ absurd.

Why wouldn't all of reddit want to be there is ~~Mad max~~ beyond ~~Thunderdome~~ me. I subscribed the second I understood how it all works. Once you read this interview I know you ~~Good Will hunting~~ will too. I mean if I were to write a ~~Schindler's list~~ list the pros would ~~fargo~~ far outweigh the ~~Con Air~~ cons. I mean its not like its a *castle in the sky* its just a great subreddit that needs proper ~~exorcist~~ attention. 

&gt;## Please explain what the hell /r/movieclub is!
&gt;&gt; It's a book club, and you can submit it more than once if it doesn't win the first time. Some movies take a while to earn their week in the spotlight.

&gt;## Where do we get these movies you assign? All rentals or are we required to leave the house?
&gt;&gt; Strictly speaking we only want people to submit movies that are either rentable or viewable on something like Hulu or Netflix. Nobody in MovieClub downloads movies, it probably won't win.

&gt;## How did /r/movieclub begin? Gimmie the Book of Genesis (Bible
&gt;&gt; I can't remember the exact thread, and someone asked why we don't have a redditor movie of the week club. I suggested that we start one and call it MovieCLub - and then another redditor swooped in, created it, and invited me to be a Mod. And then promptly disappeared from the planet, leaving us permanently with the name Insta-Herpes on the main page.

&gt;## Now tell me about the discussions. Simple ""Loved it / Hated it"" or deep philosophical shit?
&gt;&gt; The discussions don't tend to get too involved. I think even now people are shy to voice their opinion and risk downvotes. Which is too bad because there really isn't a wrong opinion about a movie. coughTwilightcough. Also we have a livestream of the movies on Sundays and a lot of the discussion happens real-time. Fewer people come back to the thread to write whole opinion pieces. But we've seen some really beautiful and in-depth analysis at times.

&gt;## What movie has had the best reaction from your community? Which week was the most fun?
&gt;&gt; Probably the best was one of the first - we watched Primer in week 15 and it just blew everyone away. For some people it was their second or third viewing but every time you watch it it's like the first time. But the most fun we had was the Kubrick marathon to celebrate Week 50. It was kind of intense.

&gt;## Anything I forgot to ask?
&gt;&gt; Where can you find a(n incomplete) list of all of the previous movies? [The MovieClub Archives](http://redditmovieclub.blogspot.com/). As you can see I've been slacking big time on updating,False,self,t5_2sgno,True,,WRITER,t3_phmjj

The English language is such a dynamic mother fucker.  I mean, it evolves as quickly as any entity or organism.  *One hundred and forty characters?  How can I possibly express my exuberance in so few keystrokes?!*

But let's step back a bit.  If we are to think of language as an organism *(any organized body or system conceived of as analogous to a living being: the governmental organism.)*

Today's featured subreddit explores this; the beauty of English language grammar.  These good people understand and celebrate the language's complexities

Here's an example of how the language can be so cool.  Lately I've been big on contranyms (or antagonyms) - words that can mean the opposite of itself...

- dust  (to remove dust or to apply dust

- sanction (to allow

- garnish (add to, as in earnings)

Thank you grammar!  Today we salute /r/grammar

&gt;So /r/grammar

&gt;&gt;You’ll find all kinds of posts looking for advice and discussions about the subtleties of communicating in written English.

&gt;What's the purpose or goal of your subreddit? Is it a celebration of the English language or a chance to laugh at the mistakes of other's?

&gt;&gt;It’s much more the former than the latter. Our community goes out of its way to be helpful, but the majority of our submissions are people asking a grammar question or wondering about the specifics of a certain rule, so it serves us well not to be dicks.

&gt;How would you describe the overall tone of /r/grammar? What makes you similar from other communities? In what ways are you different from other subreddits?

&gt;&gt;We’re not as businesslike as /r/proofreading, just wait until we get all fired up about where the period goes at the end of a quotation! (INSIDE the quotes, you limey bastards!)

&gt;Whats your favourite type of posts at /r/grammar?

&gt;&gt;I always like it when people ask us to rule on a grammar argument taking place in another subreddit. They’ll be bickering over whether someone used the phrase “begs the question” correctly

&gt;As a grammar enthusiast

&gt;&gt;Texting demonstrates the evolution of the English language in the same way Slim Jims demonstrate the evolution of cuisine. If you’re relaying unimportant information in a very casual way

&gt;&gt;Of course, they should also be sterilized.)

&gt;Any final thoughts or words?

&gt;&gt;I’ve done my best to ignore the obvious style mistakes and intentional apostrophe abuse in your questions. In the future

What it is with me and sub reddits that are focused on GIFs? I think my love for them is so strong I keep getting the chance to feature them! I'm basically the [MAGNETO](http://i.imgur.com/uEnCm.gif) of GIFs. First it was **/r/NSFW_GIF** that I featured [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/jj56p/august_15th_2011_rnsfw_gif_welcome_to_the_jungle/) and now /r/reactionGIFs. To be honest with you

1. I love funny gifs.
2. There was a void for a subreddit to feature gifs that show the exact emotion you want to portray.
2. I really &lt;3 funny gifs.

If you don't like these three reasons, on to the most thoughtout and well put interview by [SROTD](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/search?q=SROTD&amp;restrict_sr=on) himself.

&gt;##1. Please tell us how /r/reactiongifs began.
&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** Syncretic will give you 1

&gt;&gt;**syncretic** I created it on a whim. It has been a running joke in the SFWPorn Network to use reaction gifs absolutely everywhere humanly possible. Up until a few days ago we had been collecting them in my personal subreddit. However the list kept growing so much that I thought there might be a demand for an actual subreddit. When other users outside of the network started submitting content as well (most notably laketrash)

&gt;##2. How did this get to be so popular in such short time? If you did promote it

&gt;&gt;**syncretic** [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/modclub/comments/mzipy/here_is_an_excellent_example_of_how_a_welltimed/) is a submission I made to /r/modclub just last night detailing the process. It's pretty much standard procedure for all of my new subreddits

&gt;##3. What are your goals. What are your dreams? What does /r/reactiongifs offer this mixed up

&gt;&gt;**kjoneslol** I'd like to thank all of the people who help run Subreddit of the Day because it is one of the best subreddits on Reddit.

As stolen from wikipedia, Wales. It is one of two breeds known as Welsh Corgi: the other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Telling these two apart is quite easy, the latter is usually dressed in a sweater with buttons.  The corgi is one of the smallest dogs in the Herding Group and is quite adept at herding dead animals. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famed for being the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who owns sixteen and affectionately calls them her *muscle bullets*.  The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked at #11 in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, just behind step ladders and doorstops.

Today we celebrate a community devoted to corgis - the dog that is the punchline to many untold dog jokes.  Fortunately, get help or just post some damn cute photos!

Here to talk about /r/corgi is the subreddit's only moderator

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;A very abbreviated list of pro's: 1) Unbelievably cute. 2) Don't have to worry about them jumping on the table and counters. 3) It's pretty much impossible to be sad while looking at a smiling corgi. 4) Very smart. 5) They are incredibly friendly and sociable dogs.

&gt;&gt;Cons 1)Corgis are super food motivated, my family had four cats in the house and thought ""Oh well, I'm sure it's not as bad the cats"". But it is worse. When you get a corgi, I'd suggest buying stock in lint rollers.

&gt;Corgis. The ultimate predator or the ultimate prey?

&gt;&gt;Predators, THEY GO IN FOR THE KILL!*

&gt;&gt;*Kill = sniffing

But really

&gt;Hmm

&gt;&gt;Corgis, they do look like ""little angels"". However, corgis are known to get spells of demonic possession from time to time. So I guess you could say that since they are a little bit of both they are just ""down to earth"".

&gt;&gt;Carmac: Already existed when I joined Reddit. My earlier days on Reddit noticed lots of spam, so I started dumping on them. Must have been too much, one of them made me a Mod. Still trying to figure out if that was with malice or not. I do hate spam though, lots.

&gt;&gt;Kylde: Dunno :)

&gt;&gt;luster: It was founded by JokerMatt. He announced one day (a year ago?) he was leaving and before there was not much communication between the mods

&gt;&gt;MrDubious: OK

&gt;&gt;One day, and post some highly visible bullshit to let others in /new know not to upvote that post, and also to hassle said spammer. E.G....

&gt;&gt;**EAT SHIT AND DIE YOU SPAMMING FUCK. QUIT SPAMMING YOUR BULLSHIT TO REDDIT.**

&gt;&gt;One day, and he asked if maybe we should form a sub to track the repeat offenders.

&gt;&gt;Ten minutes later

&gt;&gt;For the first year, and began to establish ourselves as a presence on Reddit. However, almost immediately after Kylde joined the sub, I started backing off from active posting. There were so many of us combing /new that by the time I made a post, it was 99.999% of the time redirected to a submission made 40 seconds earlier by Kylde, then by Kylde or Bumped or CamopDude or Luster or BackPackWayne.

&gt;&gt;So, and that's how I ended up top mod despite being the least active spam submitter.

&gt;What has been your most fulfilling moment as a moderator here?

&gt;&gt;Carmac: Seeing some level of Domain Banning implemented.

&gt;&gt;Kylde: Our successful plan to spread into other subreddits as mods &amp; handle spam at it's entry-point

&gt;&gt;luster: Right before I was made an RTS mod

&gt;What has been your most frustrating moment as a moderator here?

&gt;&gt;Carmac: Not being able to do much with most middle-high karma spammers, but we're not able to get them to kill the spam itself. My analogy is - we get the shooter, but we leave the bullets, in flight.

&gt;&gt;Kylde: more insight-into/interaction-with Reddit's spam management, NO filter would catch that, only humans would spot that pattern)

&gt;&gt;luster: No action taken on obvious spammers.

&gt;Certain spammers reappear regularly over time. (i.e Ralph

&gt;&gt;Carmac: All of them.

&gt;&gt;Kylde: Ansblog is a sly, &amp; has to use shortURL services to cloak his links (unsuccessfully), but to me it's the ring who regularly buy up a pre-packaged image site then flood reddit with 1-shot clones submitting links, some of which get lucky &amp; end up with high karma

&gt;&gt;luster: Psychoass because of the twisted nature of his posts.

&gt;What are your hopes for the future of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Carmac: Reddit is already garnering a reputation of being tricky to spam

&gt;&gt;luster: That it will not be needed.

&gt;The official reddit guidelines on spamming are a bit vague. What traits do you use to decide whether a user is a spammer?

&gt;&gt;Carmac: Commercial/money tie in. If you're trying to sell something and not buying ads you're a spammer. Others include blog/site promotion, the others doing much better at that than I.

&gt;&gt;Kylde: I've changed slightly from stamping on spammers in a knee-jerk reaction to weighing up their profiles. I've had some success with users who were most definitely spamming, then we started talking, and they are now a high-profile front-page success, with 15,000 karma in 17 days, all by following our guidelines. And both cases DO submit their own site, but they've amended their behaviour to fit in with this that I send as a first warning to spam-wannabes:

&gt;&gt;&gt;You only seem to ever submit links for one domain. That makes the spam filter view you as a potential spammer. If you vary what you submit (other domains than xxxxxxx)

&gt;&gt;the 10:1 lets them profit while making sure they are also serving the community

&gt;&gt;luster: I look at their submit page. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck

&gt;During Kylde's ROTD

&gt;&gt;Carmac: Just eyes

&gt;&gt;Kylde: RES of course, screendumps can be handy proof, but a lot of it is simple pattern-recognition (Ralph is the classic example) that only comes with time spent cruising the /new queue.

&gt;&gt;luster: Normal RTS mods and other submitters to RTS cannot be compared to Kylde no matter how many monitors they have. I think I one ran across an [image](http://i.imgur.com/vA0YH.jpg) of him in action.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/ReportTheSpammers?

&gt;&gt;Carmac: Keep it up! The more we get identified and reported the more likely most of the spammers will leave at least Reddit alone. Many subscribers are identifying and reporting spammers within a minute of appearance. This is the stuff that gets through the software filters. When nearly all spam gets 404d in under a minute

&gt;&gt;Kylde: to the people who subscribe, &amp; that they don't tell about, so we all get frustrated, but sitting on the spam queue of 15 subreddits all day I can tell you there are a LOT of spammers that are being ""dealt-with"" without them (or the community) knowing about it, &amp; a lot of spam that is deleted the moment it is submitted (plus of course the spam-filter stops massive amounts BEFORE it ever hits /new). I'd like admin to reveal some stats on the filter at some point

&gt;&gt;luster: Keep up the good fight!",self,t5_2sgno,True,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/jbbdl/august_7_2011_rreportthespammers_the_subreddit/

**535 readers** for **7 months!**

I am a gamer. I wouldn't delve so far into its shithole to call myself ""hardcore"", claim something else. They claim to comment on them, not to beat them. Game streaming is a relatively new concept, but a cool one. If I had a modicrum of popularity I'd do the same, so I tip my hat in that regard. It's for people that are worth watching, and have the means to become watched.

I watch a few game streams, [AzuriteReaction](http://www.youtube.com/user/AzuriteYT) tends to have some good stuff, especially his recent 24 hour Earthbound stream.

This is where /r/VGStreams comes in. VGStreams lists and (sometimes) discusses various game streams from around the web. Think of it as the ""happening right now"" brother of /r/letsplay. Click a link

As with all good things

&gt;#1. First off

&gt;&gt;**Drumcowski** I moderate a bunch of subreddits, but my most known subreddit is /r/cringe.

&gt;&gt;**iBleeedorange** I'm a gamer

&gt;&gt;**Skitrel** I moderate, /r/hailcorporate, formerly some relationships stuff, a slew of smaller subs, and I admin in a community called Free Hugs, which sprouted from /r/freehugsbf3, a fairly reputable reddit based gaming community that enjoy regulated servers in their games.

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** I spend too much time on this site.

&gt;#2. Do you have any favorite streams you'd like to recommend?

&gt;&gt;**Drumcowski** I haven't seen enough to have a favorite yet. Whenever I have spare time I'll check the front page and pop in one of the streams for a bit depending on the game the streamer is playing. I doubt I've been to the same stream twice considering how many are posted.

&gt;&gt;**iBleeedorange** Anyone streaming Starcraft 2 is fun to watch. Sometimes I'll offer them tips in regards to their play if they ask/want them.

&gt;&gt;**Skitrel** My favourite stream

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** http://www.twitch.tv/gandhimlg

&gt;#3. How did VGStreams start? With a big bang?

&gt;&gt;**Drumcowski** I realized that there wasn't a subreddit dedicated to video game streaming, our growth has been pretty slow so far, but our subreddit is far more active than other subreddits our size. The system we set up works well, we just need more subscribers in order for the subreddit to have much of an effect. If you like watching game streams, come check out the subreddit and keep an eye out for any game you might be interested in.

&gt;&gt;**iBleeedorange** Drumcowski hit this one on the head pretty much.

&gt;&gt;**Skitrel** As above.

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** Drumcowski had the idea to create a subreddit dedicated to streaming since there really wasn't one around yet

&gt;#4. If you were starting a band

&gt;&gt;**Drumcowski** Hotpause

&gt;&gt;**iBleeedorange** I have no idea

&gt;&gt;**Skitrel** Find Satoshi

&gt;&gt;**ManWithoutModem** I'm Actually Gay

&gt;#5. Thanks a bunch

&gt;&gt;**Drumcowski** If you are apart of a streamer site

&gt;&gt;**iBleeedorange** If someone wants to get some more viewers

&gt;&gt;**Skitrel** As drumcowski said

Hello again, drop in and enjoy crappy design in all of it's obnoxious, eye melting glory!

solidwhetstone

&gt;What started /r/crappydesign?

&gt;&gt;The very first official web design job I had was for a company that made crappy websites. I felt like the only one there that knew what good design was. But it was a paycheck. Ever since then I've had this itch to call out bad design and try to make the web a nicer place to be. I'd always thought I'd like to have a constantly updating place to showcase bad design

&gt;What are your hopes for the future of the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;My hopes have already been exceeded by far. The community of r/crappydesign actively submits really great stinkers and brings some really great criticism and dialogue to the table. I love to be surprised and laugh

&gt;What are some of your favorite posts so far?

&gt;&gt;Well the current top submission is easily my current favorite. It's so excessive and flashy- especially for a ministry website. But yet- unlike a lot of the other submissions we get

&gt;What do you think are the basic elements/principles of crappy design?

&gt;&gt;Well that's the joke- there are no principles of crappy design. Crappy design comes about when you ignore the principles of good design. Things like color, business cards, websites, book covers, banners, etc. that have horrendous typography, color usage and colors. It's not done intentionally. It just comes out of ignorance to sound design principles.

&gt;What do you hope people take away from this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Well first and foremost a subreddit will thrive when a community is entertained. That's got to be the first goal. If I know I can come back every day and see new things to laugh at, it starts to become subconscious and your own designs get better. You work through a design and make better decisions because you've seen the problems others have encountered by making bad decisions. It's one thing for me to tell someone 'you shouldn't use 10 fonts on a page' but until you see it in practice covering an entire website, you don't always make the connection as to why that's a bad idea.

&gt;Do you have a message to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Keep looking at the big boys. The mom and pop companies are easy prey. We see a lot of submissions that were clearly done by people that just wanted to get something up quick and didn't have any money for a designer. When Gap released their new logo last year, and that's the kind of thing we should keep doing. Keep each other accountable and don't be afraid to speak up when you see something crappy. In the end, what may seem to the outside observer as a negative sentiment, can ultimately be the best thing for the brand and the consumer. Maybe this subreddit will help influence some companies to clean up their acts and invest in some solid creative. If we can achieve that sort of effect, I think what we're doing will pass from the realm of novelty into practicality.

I can imagine what people are thinking - rats? A subreddit about rats? Besides the fact there is a subreddit for just about anything, taking advantage of their situation.  They've been blamed for plagues, can be seen as disgusting or a pest. They also have helped aid in scientific research, served as great pets, and even have been used to detect bombs and mines.

/r/rats focuses on rats as pets - cute and cuddly

PS - I want to thank the mods for the extremely great job they did answering my questions. In fact

----


&gt;#Besides being insanely cute

&gt;&gt;**/u/penguinhearts**: Besides being cute, but also can be mischievous like cats. Every rat you have will be totally different in the way they behave. They're incredibly intelligent. For example my rats have taken to placing a specific chew toy in their food bowl when they want a refill. They will work together to try and distract me to get to something I don't want them to. They all know their names and are litter trained. They know specific phrases and many fun tricks. (spinning, fetch, stand, etc)

&gt;&gt;**/u/WeAreLegionWeAreMany**: Rats are extremely intelligent for their size

&gt;&gt;Of course aside from their wonderful personalities and intelligence there are many other reasons why rats make fantastic pets; they're highly clean animals



&gt;#What are the common types of posts subscribers can expect in /r/rats?

&gt;&gt;**/u/penguinhearts**: We've had adorable posts of baby rats, dogs. We have had posts of rats doing extreme tricks that remind you of how intelligent the rats really are. There's posts about how rats have been therapy animals and have brought cheer into people's lives despite dark circumstances. A very memorable post was an article about a husband and wife who saved a rat which intern helped to teach them how to treat each other with love and care in their marriage, as opposed to fighting. 

&gt;&gt;**/u/WeAreLegionWeAreMany**: /r/rats has an incredibly wide range of posts submitted and on the front page in any one day you're bound to get a variety. Of course the most common posts are images of people's own pet rats! [Rats sleeping](/1codjc/), [rats doing tricks](http://www.reddit.com/r/RATS/comments/erhea/tricks/ ), [rats and cats](/1d4mlo), [rats and dogs](/19pe03), [rats and their babies](/12q5dw), [rats happy to see their owners](/1g43mr), [rats being naughty and rats chewing something they shouldn't](/17uve1). Any rat picture you can imagine!

&gt;&gt;The subreddit does have a more serious side though too and there are often posts for help or advice on common ailments or even just how to introduce a new rat to their mischief. Some posts are also from potential owners or people who have suddenly found themselves looking after a rat and need help. Then, to the rats we've loved and lost and the occasional news post when rats manage to gnaw their way into the news spotlight!


&gt;#What are some of the best

&gt;&gt;**/u/WeAreLegionWeAreMany**: The best posts for me are always the [baby pictures](/16e5i6)! Bald little pink rodents are probably not most people's idea of cute


&gt;#Please tell us about you (the mods).

&gt;&gt;**/u/penguinhearts**: I'm a student studying molecular biotechnology and immunology. I work on research regarding T cells. I have systemic lupus and some other rare autoimmune diseases. I have a hard time with the diseases as they are attacking my kidneys

&gt;&gt;**/u/WeAreLegionWeAreMany**: I'm currently a PhD student studying Molecular microbiology, making new rat flairs or approving posts!



&gt;#What would your ideal rat habitat be like for you and your rats (I just came up with the term ""ratmosphere"" - too cheesy)?

&gt;&gt;**/u/penguinhearts**: My ideal rat habitat would be just to have my rats running around my house- but I have one that I can't trust

&gt;&gt;**/u/WeAreLegionWeAreMany**: My ideal rat habitat (and I'm sure many other peoples ideal habitat), a wheel, many hammocks, chew toys, boxes and wooden bridges to hide under along with ladders and a whole array of other toys. This allows them a large area to roam around in without the dangers of being completely free 100% of the time so I’d say it's as ideal as you could get! 

&gt;&gt;There have been many fantastic 'home made' rat houses though on Rattit and so long as rats have enough space (about 2.0 cubic feet for female rats and 2.5 cubic feet for male rats)


&gt;#If your pet rats could talk

&gt;&gt;**/u/penguinhearts**: My rats would say so many things. I have one rat that is hyper all the time and into everything. I swear he has ADHD He would be like ""Let me out! Let me out! Hey look at this! Mommy! Mom! Come here!!"". That's Sherlock. I have one that's a complete foodie. I've tried everything to slim him down. ""Hey mom, maybe just ""Mommy, cuddles, NOW"". Last is Tesla. I originally named him Moriarty, but on the way home I thought he was too sweet. I was wrong. He likes to annoy the other rats. He will also destroy things just for my reaction. Pretty sure he'd say ""Muhahahaha"". He's mostly black, even his tail. Now that he's older he's a lot sweeter though. Still evil.

&gt;&gt;**/u/WeAreLegionWeAreMany**: No doubt there would be numerous demands for yoghurt drops, and as such they're slowing down and much more happy to snuggle up and fall asleep on a warm human rather than run around and chatter.

You wake up. Its a nice lazy sunday. You had a great saturday night. Your memories are hazy but you can still see the beautiful girl sleeping peacefully beside you. You smile. Get up from your bed and walk to your balcony to bathe in the sunshine. You open the door to walk into bliss and .. You *Stop*. Your eyes are wide open now looking at the chaos in front of you. Smoke from buildings. People screaming. Blood *everywhere*. You try to see what are those animals which are *killing* everyone. You see one of its faces. **Zombies**. Not a good day for a hangover.   

*What do you do ? Do you run ? Do you hide ? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GONNA DO ?*  

Your mind is racing with thoughts. Every second counts. You start sweating. You run to the TV and see the news. There is *NOTHING* on. Your phone is *DEAD*. You know you are gonna be too if nothing is done. You have always laughed at zombies in movies.. But- But Now they are here!!! Your lady friend is awake and starts screaming at the monstrous sight in front of her from the balcony. You see below that the zombies are starting to enter your apartment ripping apart and devouring everyone who stands in front of them.

####WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GONNA DO ?!?!?!

The sub featured today is about making you ready for the this **EXACT** moment. /r/ZombieSurvivalTactics is equipped with people who are ready to fight against this bitch apocalypse on. If i were to choose how the world would be allowed to end, scary, romantic, crazy, traumatizing in every way. I am into dark stuff like killing and psychological traumatizing. I confess that i am incredible sadist sometimes hahaha. Zombie apocalypse is a fantasy which has been played and shown in numerous amount of games, movies and stories all across the globe and has a high chance of happening too. /r/ZombieSurvivalTactics teaches you how to be ready for this. I suggest you guys to get ready too.

Here's an awesome interview with the moderators! DO NOT MISS IT!

&gt;##1. what motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**Cr6433:** What was the motivation behind /r/ZombieSurvivalTactics? Well Me
**AuthenticCountryBoy:** I became a mod by accident a while back while trying to revive a zombie-survival-scenario-thread series. But I've been into the zombie survival concept since I was in middle school. Growing up in the middle of nowhere you have a lot of free time and a lot of guns/targets. You find ways to entertain yourself. The main thing that motivates me to mod for this sub is the real necessity of it. Yes


&gt;##2. say you see on the new that zombie apocalypse is here. what are your next steps ?
&gt;&gt;**Cr6433:** Grab my B.O.B (Bug out Bag), then actions taken from there will depend on the seriousness of what's going on. ( And to watch the news and gather as much info before it comes to facing the zombies mainly try to determine how the ""Virus"" is spread if it happens to be a virus.)  
**AuthenticCountryBoy:** Verify that everything in my B.O.B is as it should be (not like I don't check it every month, lock down our apartment and follow our preset protocol for said event. And no, I'm not disclosing the specifics any further than that.



&gt;##3. what is your dream anti-zombie weapon ?
&gt;&gt;**Cr6433:** Dream Anti-Zombie Weapon
**AuthenticCountryBoy:** Zumwalt-class Destroyer (Specific class of U.S Navy warship that should be have it's first ship commissioned in 2015. (I'm former active duty Navy)




&gt;##4. here's a case. you and your SO are running from a zombie horde. You see the city gates slowly closing in. Now an explosion takes place and your SO and you are separated. She/he is surrounded by zombies so your SO's only hope is to run into the mall nearby and make a stand there. What will you do ? will you run to the mall too and fight ? (note: there's no chance you might survive. the evacuation helicopter will come after a week) or will you save yourself ?
&gt;&gt;**Cr6433:** I would Run back and Grab my SO Hopefully the people manning the gate will draw the zombies attention and give us time to pull away from the horde
**AuthenticCountryBoy:**  My SO and I have already discussed this at length. And she knows that I'll protect her to my dying breath up until the point that my actions could be considered suicidal. She's aware of this



&gt;##5. Second case: You and your 5 friends are stuck in a school. the zombies are gonna break through the gate in 2 hours. how will you make the best of the resources to make a stand ?
note: its an ordinary public school
&gt;&gt;**Cr6433:** First though that came into mind
**AuthenticCountryBoy:** Ordinary Public Schools have a science room. I.E chemicals and normally basic internet. 2 hours I can make a world of explosives not to be underestimated. Aside from that there are various solutions in the janitors closet/officer as well. And plenty of tools that can be used. Anyone ever seen The Faculty? Yeah, counter weights/balances, or trigger mechanisms. A school is a good place for a temporary hold up or supply run. Just for resources. Me and 5 of my friends would probably make it with up to 2 casualties max depending on the time frame.



&gt;##6. Finally do you have anything to say to your present/future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Cr6433:**  To all of our present subscribers I'd Like to thank you for making the community what it is, The responses are always so well-thought out and in-depth I'd hate to be the Zombie that runs into some of you. Keep up all of what you guys do! To any future subscribers Come join Us at /r/ZombieSurvivalTactics for some fun/In-Depth discussion or for any questions regarding zombies, We won't bite!  
**AuthenticCountryBoy:** Yes. I'm not crazy, share content, share ideas, plan and assist. And don't overlook the resource link we added to the sidebar. I think we added it a year ago. There are some really useful things and I would recommend everyone do this simple prep. Go to the link, print off the instructional list for building a generator. And in your B.O.B keep the printed copy in a ziplock bag wrapped in a few layers of duct tape for additional protection/water proofing. Electricity is going to be a real game changer. And having the information there already could save your life.  
Other than that

**394 Modelers for 2 years!**

I didn't get along with my dad. He died when I was 9 but what I remember most was the yelling and fighting between him and my mom. He smoked a lot before I was born; said he quit but I remember seeing him smoking in his truck when he'd head off to whatever job he was going to that day. He was between jobs for a lot of the time. Cancer got him just before his 50^th birthday.

He loved cars. From engines to bodywork, but these toys (I learned this lesson painfully) were for looking only, not for touching. 

After he died

I started with a Dodge Viper GTS Coupe, a Subaru WRX STI. I really wanted this one to turn out special; I suppose that's why I actually never even took it out of the box. My hopes for the project outweighed my desire to finish it with the degree of polish I knew I couldn't give it. 

That's why I like /r/modelcars so much. I check out the work of the modelers on this sub and I am filled with the memories of my childhood

&gt;1) What was the impetus for this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**rhs856:** I started r/ModelCars because I was just getting into the hobby and wanted to find other builders. Having those builders be redditors too made it even more awesome.After a couple of months

&gt;2) What are your favourite model to build? Any pics of your work?

&gt;&gt;**rhs856:** My favorite model to build was my [55 Chevy Truck.](http://imgur.com/a/uxekc#0) I built it for an Apocalyptic Vehicle community build over at Model Cars Magazine's forums. I wanted it to be one of those vehicles that would travel from camp to camp, shovel, pick, and the guns. I probably had 70+ hours into it from start to finish.

&gt;3) What is the best part about modding this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**rhs856:** The best part about modding ModelCars is the community. I set out to make it a place where anyone could feel proud of their work and get help when they needed it. Everyone is so friendly and supportive, or a completed build. I enjoy it all.

&gt;4) What is your favourite submission to /r/modelcars? (If you have several please feel free to elaborate)

&gt;&gt;**rhs856:** My favorite submission would probably be [this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ModelCars/comments/19xf5l/high_speed_model_car_build_stop_frame_animation/?sort=confidence) A guy made a stop motion movie of a model car being built

&gt;5) Why do you build model cars? What do you get out of it?

&gt;&gt;**rhs856:** I started building model cars as an adult after seeing a Stacy David commercial for a contest Revell was putting on. I picked up a 66 Impala and some supplies and got to work. I tool some risks (opening the driver's door and trunk) and made some mistakes (tube glue everywhere!!)

&gt;6) Any other hobbies you care to discuss?

&gt;&gt;**rhs856:** I am a hobby junky: currently, play board and card games (Dominion, Arkham Horror, Betrayal at Houss on the Hill), and I'm rebuilding a 77 Pacer moped. In the past, I've done everything from coin collecting and playing guitar to crocheting and playing Magic: The Gathering. I love finding out the ""secrets"" that a hobby has once you get into it, and learning about the different values of its community.

&gt;7) Any projects on reddit you would like to plug?

&gt;&gt;**rhs856:** As for other Reddit projects

**783 GSL Pros for 1 year**

/r/castit is a neat little subreddit that encourages its users to participate in DIY casting of StarCraft 2 games. The Starcraft client allows you to download other peoples saved game replays as remarkably small files. When you load these games you are provided with an in game view from either player's perspective

Submitters include a link to a community specific dropbox file and the potential casters will grab that file and load it up. Casters need to be set up to record video on their computer; FFSplit or a similar free software is your best bet, the casters, and the viewers.

Casting is an art. The ability to watch a game and interpret what is happening, or how a player is responding to the strategy they see their opponent using by countering it either poorly, adequately, or perfectly. 

I have found casting to be surprisingly difficult

I spoke with the mods to get some background on the subreddit. 

&gt;What was the inspiration behind /r/castit? Do you even MLG??

&gt;&gt;**Hobo4Craft:** I suppose you could, simply because /r/starcraft was not very inclined to listen to a no-name caster. /r/castit was born to give a name to those once unheard, not only providing them a community in which to be casters but also grow as such. #420mlg

&gt;&gt;**AngryKittens:** First off let me say it's an honor getting nominated. Nice to see others have found our little corner of the internet and enjoy what we do. We have a rather strong sense of community here in castit and we appreciate every new member joining in. We don't MLG

&gt;Which mods cast? Who does what? What's that thing flying by?@Q?@?

&gt;&gt;**Hobo4Craft:** I don't think any of the mods cast. I used to cast before university but have been way too busy during school to fit that in. It's a shame since it's something I was pretty passionate about; I hope to start again this summer.

&gt;&gt;**AngryKittens:** None of the mods cast

&gt;On a scale please rate the average quality of crowd sourced casts produced by your subscribers (Note: you must define the scale)

&gt;&gt;**Hobo4Craft:** On a scale from CombatEX to Artosis (CombatEX being the best

&gt;&gt;**AngryKittens:** On a scale from 1 to 10 where 7 is the highest I would say the casts are all excellent.

&gt;Off topic question: What is one thing that really cheeses you off?

&gt;&gt;**Hobo4Craft:** ZvZ

&gt;&gt;**AngryKittens:** When people posts to castit without adding info about league / race. And Infestors.

&gt;What's your personal favourite casting submission/comment?

&gt;&gt;**AngryKittens:** Too many to choose from

&gt;Does your subreddit have any rules? What should first time casters know around here?

&gt;&gt;**Hobo4Craft:** We don't have many set-in-stone rules except to respect. Know that when you come here you're making yourself vulnerable to criticism and should receive it kindly because that's the best way to grow.

&gt;&gt;**AngryKittens:** Main written rules are all in the sidebar and primarily focus on how to format a submission. We do not have any specific rules for how to cast a game

&gt;Anything to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**Hobo4Craft:** Thanks

&gt;&gt;**AngryKittens:** Thanks! Look forward to hearing back from you!

Have you ever wondered about how computers work? Have you ever thought about getting down to the very basics of what makes a machine like that run? Have you ever just wanted to mess with metal parts until lights lit up or smoke appeared

In my case, in his backyard, we worked with strange tools and wondrous machines, dodging the occasional pipe or offset valve. He kept using terms I only heard from him, constantly muttering something about ""ferrocores"" not complying with ""DL hashing standards"" or cursing under his breath at ""Yalgeth"" and ""her fu-- oh, sorry... very stupid limit"". I never quite understood what he was working on, but it was fascinating. I grew up, and eventually stopped coming over to see him. Life

Friday, pointing to the lumbering package he left on my porch. Shivering, I brought it inside. It was heavy, and... *vibrating* somehow. I slowly opened it, and there it was: a machine I had seen a hundred times, so familiar and yet so distant in my memory. As it turns out, my grandpa had passed on and left this box in my name. I had just gotten my first very own VX Machine.

It was a beauty of a VX4 Mark III. I flipped a few switches that I recognized by sight, I've been able to reach the 0.40 Delta mark my grandpa had set, and I'm still learning and getting better all the time. For example, simply [upgrading my ferrocores](http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/ewxef/) from the stock VX4 set to the ones I built (completing grandpa's blueprints) made my dephasing interval shrink from 9.10 to 8.02! Throw some adjustments due to recent discoveries regarding Holt's Junction, and BAM: 0.45 Delta, *on a VX4!* It might not be impressive to most, but it sure was to me. The folks over at /r/VXJunkies can help anyone get going with a basic module in no time - just add passion

And now

&gt;##1. I see a few of you are directors in well known VX-related companies. Why did you choose to establish a presence on Reddit?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** This is where the community is growing. Just 10 years ago a CRD-20 cost over $62k for a unit with only 9 static pinboards

&gt;##2. Could you share a highlight of your VX career?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** I am mostly known in the community for my 10e-16 Yalgeth Run and my 7 year tenure with Dr. Miljavic Ernada on parallel alignments with reduced harmonics

&gt;##3. What is the highest *stable* delta you've reached pre-Holt's Junction?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** We have a YL minus 10e-13 minimum delta requirement for modding in the community.

&gt;##4. What do you think will be the state of VX Modules in 10 years? 20 years?
&gt;&gt; **Dragonai** VX is to computing as Bitcoin is to currency. Currently, these lesser methods are popular in physics and chemistry labs all over the country (I'd venture to say even across the globe, though Switzerland and the Iberian nations are taking great strides to standardize). I'd say within a decade or two, every modern home will be host to a VX module. Raising kids with one in the home will pique their curiosity, and they will naturally want to tinker with ?-cohesion and Fankel geometry; it's a deep and ever-growing field and the barrier of entry is honestly lower than people think; ignorance is simply easier than understanding. :)

&gt;##5. What VX model would you recommend for soon-to-be-junkies reading this? Everyone has their preferences
&gt;&gt; **Dragonai** The VX5 with a Rockwell chromatosilicate ferrocore, but hear me out. The 5 lends itself extraordinarily well to low-resistance magnitude compression due to the copper gasket, which is perfect for the amateur enthusiast. They top out at about 4300 kTr, so no worrying about destroying any microwaves!

&gt;##6. Great
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** It can be difficult for a new VXer to distinguish between pseudo-scientific nonsense (like compacting Yalgeth's Limit in a variable wavelength diamatic structure) and true cutting edge advancement in the field (such as some of the work coming out of Australia on uniform distribution of delta cohesion

So there you have it. Whether you're just starting out and looking for advice or you're a old-timer coming over to brag about your accomplishements

When my friends asked me to play Dead Space

Normally when i play games i do two things. First i start with the difficult level and second i run A LOT. I tried both of these things in this and it ended in a [disaster](http://www.gamingsymmetry.com/b/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Dead-Space-1.jpg) with my ass being bare scrapped by blood thirsty aliens &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; or [*necromorphs*](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Fk05dzpoSQ/TWG_q_0Nk7I/AAAAAAAAAck/_s0FuGHwm18/s640/deadspace2.jpg) :(

The story basically revolves around a person called [Isaac Clarke](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110314235148/deadspace/images/d/d0/Isaac_DS2.jpg) who basically has to survive through the ordeals put on him battling various types or Aliens or *necromorphs* as they call it here. And let me tell you he has a really [baddass suit](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120617003023/deadliestfiction/images/9/91/Isaac_clarke.jpg)


When i say this game is scary i mean it! The sheer combination of the dark graphics, suspense and crazy different types of [horrifying aliens](http://www.dealspwn.com/writer/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/necromorph.jpg) really makes you piss in your pants if you play in the night (especially if you are playing alone in the house and suddenly someone touches you &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; . . Dont ask me how i know this &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)

Winning many awards

The next part of the saga is coming up on June 4th and it promises to be even more scarier. 

In a nutshell the cool armors of isaac clarke

If you havent tried it i strongly recommend to do it today!

so join me today with the moderators for a juicy interview!

&gt;##1. Which is your favourite dead space ? 1 or 2 ? why ?
&gt;&gt;**nicolauz:** Dead Space 1 because of the more solitary/scary feel to it.  
**AIDS_Pizza:** DS1. To be honest this is the only game that I've played thoroughly. Can't comment on the others!  
**ephphatha:** DS1. Everything was new and atmosphere was perfect.


&gt;##2. which is you favourite type of necromorph ?
&gt;&gt;**nicolauz:** I'd say none of them because they're all terrifying but I do like the Military Tweaker/fast one's from DS1 because you really have to be careful and use stasis or you're dead real fast.  
**AIDS_Pizza:** The hunter.  
**ephphatha:** Lurker. Reanimated baby corpse with tentacles. Even the lurker intro in DS1 was great.

&gt;##3. Are you excited about the upcoming dead space 3 ?
&gt;&gt;**nicolauz:** Absolutely ! I love sci-fi and horror and will always be a fan of how the future of humanity can try and survive in a terrifying future.  
**AIDS_Pizza:** Certainly! New environments
**ephphatha:** Co-op. Doing a solo playthrough first and then teaming up with friends to slay some necromorphs.


&gt;##4. What all are you expecting from it ? what changes ?
&gt;&gt;**nicolauz:** A lot more action and more enemies coming at you at once. Hopefully a finality to Isaac's chapter and a good fleshing out of the new guy. Biggest thing is an expansion of how to stop marker/unitologists from destroying humanity.  
**AIDS_Pizza:** I'm a sucker for new gear and weapons. I am definitely looking forward to just an array of new features in the game.  
**ephphatha:** I expect it to be a great deal of fun. Also some great scares.


&gt;##5. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**nicolauz:** Fresh content and discussion is brought on by it's member's so feel free to draw/write/create and share with your fellow DS fanatics !  
**AIDS_Pizza:** /r/DeadSpace started as a subreddit that I created for no real reason after I beat the first game. I had no plans or ambitions for it. Today it has grown into an active
**ephphatha:** Keep up the great posts!

And today we are here. I am going to share with you /r/4sentencegamereviews

I sat with the mod A_Queer_Orc for a nice interview and look what she has to say!

&gt;##1. What motivated you to moderate/create this subreddit ? 
&gt;&gt;**A_Queer_Orc:** It originally started as a joke almost

&gt;##2. Which is the best game review you have seen ?
&gt;&gt;**A_Queer_Orc:** Probably one of the earliest ones. It was by ""akebeth"" and was for Amnesia

&gt;##3. Do you play any games ? what types and games ?
&gt;&gt;**A_Queer_Orc:** Yes, and from time to time a bullet hell like rRootage.

&gt;##4. Do you have anything to say to your readers and future subscribers ?

I've only cereal today to eat.  I'm just lazy about cooking.  My idea of cooking is microwaving a Hot Pocket.  I'm lame like that.  You shouldn't be me

----

&gt;What type of questions could/should someone ask in /r/AskCulinary?

&gt;&gt;**unseenpuppet**: Pretty much anything. If your braise came out chewy, anything. We are here to help you! We love to converse about our beloved craft. We have hundreds of professional cooks/chefs/bakers/writers that want to help you in your gastronomic en devours! Not to mention a plethora of talented and intelligent home cooks. The only thing we do ask, is that you don't just come to us just for our recipes! Most of us cook by taste, memory and feel, not from a recipe after all!

&gt;&gt;**Donnerkatze**:  Well all technique based questions are definitely welcome. Anything really

&gt;What should I eat tonight?

&gt;&gt;**unseenpuppet**:I think all of reddit can agree: Bacon. But seriously, salty, meaty, fatty, smoky. It's hard to go wrong. Try it in anything from pasta to sauces to ice cream.

&gt;&gt;**Donnerkatze**:  Steak!

&gt;What have been some overall trends in the advice given? What would you say the best advice has been?

&gt;&gt;**unseenpuppet**:Proper seasoning is probably the best or most consistent advice we give. The right amount of salt not can

&gt;&gt;**JakeCameraAction**:  If we were to make a basic rules list of AskCulinary

&gt;&gt;**Donnerkatze**:  The only real trend is that, there has been extremely little trolling. To the point where we've only had to ban like 2 people. That's pretty awesome, it's a really great environment.

&gt;What advice would you give for someone with little or no cooking experience?

&gt;&gt;**unseenpuppet**: Don't be afraid. I see way too many people who are terrified of going anywhere near the stove. Cooking is an amazing and extremely important skill to have. It isn't too hard either. Just have confidence in yourself and enjoy it!

&gt;&gt;**Donnerkatze**:  .Just cook. A lot. I read something someone posted here once that really made a lot of sense and helped me cook a lot better. ""Don't be afraid to try anything. 90% of the time

&gt;&gt;**hamsaurus**:  Experiment. For me, experimentation is key. The worst thing that can happen is that you wind up ruining a meal, but that's a lesson learned for next time. It's the best way to learn how long to cook something to your taste, what flavours to put together and just about everything else you'll need to know. Just don't get discouraged! Oh, and buy a meat thermometer if you're still not sure whether something is cooked. Be safe.

&gt;&gt;**ZootKoomie**:  I would add, your ingredients and your tastes. If those onions look plenty browned to you, do not leave them on the flame for the extra five minutes the recipe calls for.

&gt;Have there been some exceptionally memorable moments in /r/AskCulinary?

&gt;&gt;**unseenpuppet**: There has been so many. We have grown at a tremendous rate. We have been truly fortunate to attract very skilled and informative professionals that love to pass on their knowledge. Above all though, and hopefully inspired someone to cook more or better is what keeps this community together.

Anyways


The wise, answered our questions about the subreddit:

&gt;What caused the inception of ParallelWorldProblems?

&gt;&gt;BoS: There had been several spinoffs of the “first world problems” meme and subreddit by May of last year. Then I watched /r/ancientworldproblems debut on /r/newreddits with /r/futureworldproblems hot on its heels

&gt;&gt;I thought, have not happened, and will never happen”, so I created /r/ParallelWorldProblems.

&gt;&gt;At first, it’s had a steady stream of subscribers and posts.

________

&gt;&gt;pac: I'll leave the actual story of the day BrowsOfSteel created the subreddit to him, interesting, and exercising my imagination is a big part of why I love reading the submissions in this subreddit. I wish I submitted more, but alas, time gets the better of me.

&gt;What's the darkest timeline you've come across?

&gt;&gt;BoS: The darkest timeline I have come across is a timeline in which /r/ParallelWorldProblems never existed.

&gt;&gt;A month ago I noticed I hadn’t seen any PWPs on my front page for a fortnight. I browsed to the subreddit’s main page and was surprised to see that it claimed to have been created seventeen days before (not eleven months) by someone other than me

&gt;&gt;It was a very apropos problem

&gt;&gt;The joke had gone on long enough, restored the true one, and ended this bizarre chapter in the subreddit’s history.

____

&gt;&gt;pac: The darkest timeline is any timeline in which we mourn something gone wrong in our timeline. It's great to make a joke about what could have been

&gt;If you could go back and change one historical event

&gt;&gt;BoS: I would make Leif Eriksson the explorer that initiated the exchange between the Old World and the New
I’m not sure exactly what would happen

_______

&gt;&gt;pac: I am going to pussyfoot around of this question only because I am always harping on fate in my life–not the ""there's a reason for everything"" excuse–but because the events that lead up to any historical event, Rwanda, pretty much all terroristic events all come to mind when thinking of historical events to change, but I'm a firm believer of becoming stronger out of tragedy. You are either weak and will wither, or like muscle will loosen apart but come back together tighter and tougher.

&gt;What are some of the most common parallel world problems?

&gt;&gt;BoS: Parallel worlds have major issues with television shows that are short-lived in our universe running for many seasons in theirs. It seems Firefly and Arrested Development are extraordinarily dull in most parallel worlds.

&gt;&gt;On the bright side

_____

&gt;&gt;pac: I see way too many ""Season X of Firefly/popular cancelled cult show SUCKS"". I totally loved Firefly

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of r/PWP?

&gt;&gt;BoS: I would like to thank the subscribers of /r/ParallelWorldProblems for sharing problems for the rest of us to chuckle at. Fewer people read the comments

* They have quite possibly the coolest logo on reddit; it being [a real-life

* There is a dude called SpastikChuwawa who makes unspeakably hilarious stop-motion shorts using lego. [This is my favorite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9jlj7Ng7Io&amp;feature=relmfu)


Here are the mods PepaQuin and getdamonkey to answer the questions you always wanted to ask


&gt;## If you had to pick one of your own LEGO creations to present to the world

&gt;&gt; **PepaQuin:**  I've built a lot of stuff over the years

&gt;&gt; **getdamonkey:** That's tough. I'm split between [Clerks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/getdamonkey/6051191031) and [The Stonecutter's Lodge](http://www.flickr.com/photos/getdamonkey/6500048069) but if my wife is reading this

&gt;## What is the best LEGO build you've seen on the web?

&gt;&gt; **PepaQuin:** This is a very dificult question, [Bruceywan](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bruceywan/) , and [Orion Pax](http://www.flickr.com/photos/orion_pax/)

&gt;&gt; **getdamonkey:** There's too much out there to pick from. In general I'm a sucker for two kinds of builds. [Giant robots like Voltron by Grand Admiral](http://www.flickr.com/photos/grandadmiral/3819491062) and skillfully built small models that demonstrate really good piece usage like [Ripsaw's micro Serenity](http://www.flickr.com/photos/42712314@N02/6196716898).
My personal favorite on the subreddit so far has been PepaQuin's Reddit Alien. If you want one

&gt;## If I want to get back into LEGO

&gt;&gt; **getdamonkey:** Starting out,000 LEGO bricks to make something worthwhile.
As for bulk brick

&gt;&gt; **PepaQuin:** I tend to buy my LEGO elements brand new - in the sets that LEGO sells


&gt;## How active is the adult LEGO community?

&gt;&gt; **PepaQuin:** The AFOL community spans the entire globe. We share our works online, there is probably an equal number of small and large regional groups of LEGO fans that get together in person and have special events, displays, shows, and large conventions

&gt;&gt; **getdamonkey:** I can't speak for /r/LEGO but /r/AFOL is largely an extension of the community that already exists on flickr and Eurobricks.

&gt;## What are your aims with the AFOL reddit? 

&gt;&gt; **PepaQuin:**  r/afol is geared more for builders and hobbyists

&gt;&gt; **getdamonkey:** The main goal of /r/AFOL is to showcase great LEGO creations that are outside the realm of what set instructions tell you to build. A secondary motivation is to help redditors who have an interest in LEGO find out how to become more involved in the broader LEGO community",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/rb90s/march_24_2012_rafol_adult_fans_of_lego/

It's not often to see something become a cultural staple in the way Pink Floyd has done. Most people can probably hum out a line or two of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"". And it's almost a given now to own a DSotM poster at some point in your life. 

With such a large and devoted base

Because the community reflects so well on the band itself, old news and new facts, and interviews are all available to the biggest of PF fans. And the door is always open to new listeners as well! 

With today's featured SROTD, can sit back and enjoy some music, whether it be familiar or new. (Even better, subscribe and submit! Although /r/PF is a little small now, but it's a hell of a start, and it could be made into a monster if we all pull together as a team.)

&gt;When did you first listen to Pink Floyd? What were your first thoughts?

&gt;&gt;Like many

&gt;&gt;My first thoughts? How can this music be so perfect..? And this is still my reaction every time I listen to Pink Floyd.

&gt;What do you think is the most underrated album?

&gt;&gt;Probably Obscured by Clouds. Not many people know about this album and I think it shows another face of Pink Floyd.

&gt;&gt;Other than that

&gt;What sorts of posts come up in /r/PinkFloyd?

&gt;&gt;Videos, self post of people who just discovered the band, show dates and announcements, etc. Basically we allow anything related to Pink Floyd!

&gt;What other musicians/bands would you recommend to people who like the PF sound?

&gt;&gt;To be honest

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/PinkFloyd?

&gt;&gt;/r/Android was founded about two years ago. The purpose of the subreddit is to discuss the Android mobile operating system. From about 2009-2010 the subreddit was relatively small. But

&gt;&gt;deodrus adds:  r/Android was created by his highness

&gt;&gt;Within this past month,368 pageviews](http://i.imgur.com/a4ass.jpg) in a day. These numbers are eclipsed on days when the Android platform experiences news like significant [ROM updates](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/eh2jf/gingerbread_aka_android_23_is_out/), [Market updates](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/fdyhn/android_market_new_website/), and new awesome apps (e.g Google Voice and Skype).

&gt;This is easily the largest subreddit I've featured

&gt;&gt;It's hard to answer this question. But
First

&gt;&gt;Second, have come to /r/Android to look for beta testers for their apps. But most importantly, /r/Android sees tons of small time developers using the subreddit for feedback and offering support for their apps. There are times when you can actually see developer's apps evolve through the discussions within posts.

&gt;&gt;Third, someone knows a fix or a place to go to get a fix.

&gt;&gt;Finally

&gt;What are you most proud of as a mod of r/android? Anything you'd like to change?

&gt;&gt;I am really proud of the willingness of people to volunteer for projects. We are soon going to create a Wiki that is going to house and maintain some of our best tips and posts. Several of our members have already expressed volunteering in the venture.

&gt;&gt;We are also in the process of helping turn /r/Android into a credible source of feedback for end-users by assigning customized icons for users who are Official-Android-OS-devs, Google-team, and Custom-ROM teams.

&gt;&gt;We have toyed with the idea of free giveaways on /r/Android and are in talks with publishers

&gt;What are your favourite type of posts on r/android?

&gt;&gt;I like reading the typical Android news. I always find interest all the patent

&gt;Alright, sing a song... what would you like to say to the people at home?

&gt;&gt;All I have to say is this: If you own an Android phone and flash custom ROMs
Other than that, and NippleNuts for their hard work with /r/Android. Finally, I'd like to thank all of the developers who have reached out to our community and asked for our feedback.

**838 readers** for **1 year!**

There comes a time in the life of every gamer where he must don a gasmask and kill some zombies. It's inevitable. Ever since the Commodore I've been killing zombies, against near a trillion zombies, in more games than most would admit. I deserve a medal.

The Dead Linger is the subject for today's zombie killing seminar. It's a game where you kill zombies. What's more, yes, popularized by minecraft), giving purchasers access to the game per build. The current build is, as of writing, 008b. In TDL, as of the latest version

You spawn in the middle of somewhere, stores, farms, and all that fun stuff. You run around the world gathering items, killing zombies, exploring, and just generally surviving. Multiplayer is loads funner than the singleplayer, rifle

As I type this, or badass tones that usually accompany my features. No, this one is [""In the House, in a Heartbeat"", by John Murphy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSYYEDXaGo0). Better known as the theme to 28 Days Later. It invokes a feeling in me that few other songs can achieve. A feeling of running, and needing to survive the long night. It makes me remember days far gone when those feelings were always so close at heart. It reminds me of the aching that only someone in my boots can feel.

The Dead Linger does not give me those feelings. It is no horror game, yet to be molded by its developers. ""We here at SRotD"" is not applicable, for I don't know their thing. I won't speak in third person, distancing it. *I* love indie developers, and *I* love The Dead Linger. Not because it's a fun game to play, but because the potential of it speaks a great deal about game development in general. It's not a special snowflake, but it's a damn good one. Here's hoping that it becomes a game to be remembered.

Because this game is in alpha, then polish them when we can. I hear some graphical changes in houses and various textures are coming soon, but I don't believe they have a professional artist on the team, so work is slow. If you're someone who snubs bad graphics, won't look twice at the pixels of old, or laugh at younger PC games for their countable polygons, then this game isn't for you. However, well

Finally, but it does happen. Mattresses, like in many games for whatever reason (Garry's Mod, I'm looking at you) are completely weird. They're magic carpets, able to propel you across the map and into the skies. Sometimes houses spawn in midair, which is unfortunate, but if you can make it to their second floor you get a really nice base. Third, leaving only floating windows. It's weird, no errors, but even that light knows where its job ends.

I sat down (code for email conversation) with the developer/CEO to ask him a few questions. Here's what he had to say.

&gt;1. First off

&gt;&gt;**SNDZag1** My name is Geoff Keene, and design director of Sandswept Studios, and I'm currently the project lead for our second title, The Dead Linger.

&gt;2. A big part of TDLs web presence is on reddit

&gt;&gt;**SNDZag1** I frequented Reddit before we had a subreddit for any of our games, concerns, or just say thank them for being part of our community and enjoying our game.

&gt;3. How did you first get into game development

&gt;&gt;**SNDZag1**  I started Sandswept Studios at 17, DETOUR (which eventually landed on Steam after a rough development), and now we've been working on The Dead Linger ever since. I haven't had any direct work with other game studios, but I did work on mod projects, hobby map-making, and so on throughout my teenage years.

&gt;4. A few friends of mine are on the fence about this game

&gt;&gt;**SNDZag1** I'd say if you want a real zombie survival experience inspired by works like The Walking Dead (original comic) and older movies in the zombie genre, and improving, The Dead Linger is where it's at. Getting on board early ensures we continue steady development, and allows players to directly influence where the game ends up in the end through feedback. Just today we had a community member on skype with us, helping us fix a bug he was experiencing. As for the price tag, the price tag for Alpha is the price tag for a massive, feature-filled game, especially with all the tertiary stuff we pay for as gamers

&gt;5. Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;**SNDZag1** Be sure to come check out our forums over at Sandswept.net

Well, of course, the subreddit. Shouting out to /r/tdl for being a cool community, and to Sandswept Studios for being a cool developer.

As an aside to those out there that may believe we get paid for this sort of thing (/r/hailcorporate &lt;3): We don't, ~~all~~ ~~most~~ some of us have integrity.

Beside giving you [new energy](http://imgur.com/70LU9), let you meet your hero, or even make you fear the dark for the rest of your life. 

On this subreddit you can share your dreams every day. But to post your dreams frequently you need to remember them
I always forget my dreams

One of the reasons is that I just cant write down my dreams immediatley after waking up, which makes you very sleepy. I leave my home while its dark, and I return in the evening, also when its dark. It's even getting so bad that my friends are calling me Bane. 


At /r/TodayiDreamed every dream is welcome
And are you bad at remembering your dreams like me

Now we jump to the interview


&gt;##1.How was this subreddit born and how has it developed?
&gt;&gt; **todayidreamed** I've kept a dream journal on and off for the last 7 years give or take, so every once in a while when I found a dream related submission on big subreddits I'd just plug the subreddit in there. And well, all this changed and increased our subscribers 10x was with [this submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y2o3y/today_i_stumbled_upon_rtodayidreamed_and_got/) on askreddit, since then we've been really glad to have a lot of activity and interesting dreams to see and the opportunity to share with a bigger audience.

&gt;##2.What will people find on this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **todayidreamed** TodayIdreamed is all about jumping into other people's dream world and sharing your own. On a regular basis you'll find, funny dreams that are so silly and unexpected, and a community of dreamers and aspiring dreamers with whom to share these dreams with.


&gt;##3.What is considered a perfect post?
&gt;&gt; **todayidreamed** A perfect post would definitely consist of a recent dream narration. Dreams have that quality that as time passes you forget more details, we're hoping to get some artistic submissions in the future! Art inspired by dreams, be it painting, music, or any other medium, with some context of the inspiration dream.

&gt;##4.What is the best or funniest dream you saw getting posted on this subreddit? 
&gt;&gt; **todayidreamed** There's plenty of good dreams that I've seen around


&gt;##5.Some people wont always remember their dreams. Do you have some tips avoiding this?
&gt;&gt; **todayidreamed** What I've realized with experience is that keeping a dream journal does help a lot, whenever you wake up, try to hold unto any lingering feelings such as love or fear, these usually help give an overall idea of what the dream was about and help guide the mind back to the dream.


&gt;##6.Would you like to say anything? The last paragraph is all yours.
&gt;&gt; **todayidreamed**Well, fear, and surrealism of other people's dreams.

Is rubbernecking a global concern?  I'm assuming it is because ignorance is not unique to North America

The whole thing plays out the same way every time.  You're speeding along and suddenly you realize you've never traveled this fast on this road at this time of day in your life!!  Man

Step two

Step three brings the shame.  You sit behind a car with right wing political bumper stickers on it while other lanes seem to progress with smugness and they have better hair than you.  All science goes out the window because we have just proved the existence of God

Eventually all lanes slow down to your speed and it becomes a game called ""shoot for the holes"".  If you see an opening in another lane that is approximately equal to the size of your car (give or take a meter)

When you do finally reach the accident you've built up enough fury and vitriol. That special day you've been saving up for? That day when someone takes your daughter while she's in Europe and you have a certain set of skills?  I know you've been saving up for that day but why don't you go ahead and spend that energy now.  It's a fact that you must reach maximum pressure before traffic can open up

And then you see the carnage.  What's this?  Someone pulled off to the side of the road for no apparent reason and caused you to spend 10 minutes in hell?  Well

And that

Alright readers

I am not gonna lie to you. This past week and a half has been seriously brutal on your dear friend

The majority of my days have been spent on construction sites. Busting concrete slabs; piece by piece. Truly the most cathartic of tasks.

I have become a artisan with the 65 lb. jackhammer. A skilled and seasoned craftsman in breaking things that refuse to be broken. 

KRRRKRRRKRRRRKRRRRKRKRRR. The sound of the steel hitting the concrete still rings in my ears

My arms wreek with a deep sore pain I can't seem to shake. The kind you get after you pull a muscle. Not bad enough to keep you in bed

Sleep eludes me

I work with 4 other general laborers who are all 55+ years old;
2 of which are over 65. Eloy

Eloy

An alpha personality

It's difficult for me to relate to men so far outside peer group and ever farther outside my constructions and expectations of reality. They have lived though things and have seen things I know I will never be able to empathize with. Ever. 

That's a really weird concept to think about. 
What do these men know about life that I don't; and frankly

Today's write up will be short. I have to be up in a few hours to work harder than I did the day before

r/QuotesPorn is your mecca for all things quotable. Submissions are mostly inspiring or emotionally laden images with the quote super-imposed over them. Lots of insightful quipping from great and humble minds. Granted, they allude to the fact that there are other people in the world who think similarly to you; and that might be the most assuring feeling of them all. 

Browse the ""NEW"" or ""TOP"" tabs of this sub and see how it fits. If you like it

#[/r/Discworld](/r/Discworld)

A community of 1

This subreddit is devoted to the discussion of the series of fantasy novels by Terry Pratchett. The Discworld novels are set on a flat, a great tortoise.

The series of novels is so very beloved because there is such a great combination of humour

Also, and mildly evolves things as he goes along, tweaking them to even greater heights of funny and meaning.

&gt;Tell us about yourself!

&gt;&gt;I'm Daychilde. I found reddit through my website from a couple of years ago, so I ended up moving here and not looking back. So it's always easy for me to remember when I joined: 2 September 2009. :-)

&gt;&gt;I've worked my way up through the moderating ranks, r/freebies, r/coupons, r/adhd, and r/discworld (along with a few smaller subreddits).

&gt;&gt;I love the community

&gt;So what would we find at /r/discworld?

&gt;&gt;We have a wide variety of posts, as well as about Terry Pratchett himself and his fight for the right to die (he has Alzheimer's). There's discussion about favorite passages; even the occasional picture or art that's relevant.

&gt;&gt;I keep moderation to a minimum

&gt;Give us three good reasons why we should subscribe.

&gt;&gt;There's only one: If you have any interest in Discworld, art, and discussion. ;-)

&gt;Give us the elevator-pitch... one minute to describe and sell Discworld.

&gt;&gt;Discworld gives us a mirror to hold up to our own world. It's clearly a magical place - couldn't exist without magic; and is therefore immediately surreal and impossible. At the same time

&gt;&gt;One thing I've always noticed about Pratchett is his obvious love for *people*. I've learned to see the good in everyone

&gt;&gt;Also

&gt;Anything you'd like to say to your readers and those who will be readers from this point onward.

&gt;&gt;To my existing readers: Thank you for being there! We've had great times

&gt;&gt;To my new readers: Come tell us your favorite Discworld-related story

This is the same series redditors can't stop reciting the lines to any moment they get. And rightfully so.

On to some really tough questions to dig deep into the subreddit.

**Congratulations on being featured for today's Subreddit of the Day!**

&gt;&gt; Oh wow

**How did this sub-reddit come about?**

&gt;&gt; Well I wasn't here for the creation. But I became a mod after I wrote a long and passionate letter to the mods so that I could sexify the reddit to its present glory. I do have to credit [MonkeyCrumpets](/user/MonkeyCrumpets) for the base CSS that I modified. 

**How many times have you seen the series?**

&gt;&gt; Honestly, I've seen that less then the series because every time I see it, it feels like its trying to end the current series and heading towards somewhere else. Somewhere I'm still not willing to go.

**But the show ended almost a decade ago!?**

&gt;&gt; So? The original StarWars triology ended almost 30 years ago. The first animated series of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ended over 15 years. Don't even get me started on Transformers, as long as its good it will be stay that way however old it is. Its Americana at its best. Did I mention recently we had gotten behind Nathan Fillion when he wanted to buy the rights to the show from FOX. Some one started a pledge drive and a serious amount of money was pledged.

**You win

&gt;&gt; You have to recite this with me in unison. Yes, and we will call it... 'This Land'. (as T-Rex) I think we should call it...your grave! (Stegosaurus) Ah, curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal! (T-Rex) Ha ha HA! Mine is an evil laugh...now die! You are in.

**890 babies running around without diapers for 11 days**

Its been what? 12 days? Almost two weeks ago since [I blamed all parents](http://redd.it/1j6o72) for everything wrong in this world? I'm here to tell you

But still I had to either prove my theory or [go punt my cat](http://i.imgur.com/q7oYEpB.jpg) and then go back to sleep. The choice was obvious. The cat scored a winning field goal for our team.

&gt;&gt;**CarneCongenitals** There was a post submitted on /r/funny (Child abuse at Hardee's) and /u/unwanted_puppy commented that these should have their own subreddit. I thought it was a great idea so I created it and we have been trying to build it up and improve it since then.

&gt;&gt;**/u/TheJackal8** I saw a request for new mods

&gt;##2. Whats your favorite post so far?

&gt;&gt;**CarneCongenitals**  I like [this one](www.pbh2.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funniest-kid-gifs-dandelion.gif) because its the epitome of being confused as a kid and not knowing how something works

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8** My favorite post is is either [this](http://i.minus.com/i5sWbHBEUICvN.gif) or [this](http://gifs.gifbin.com/102011/1317664598_kid_vs_water_hose.gif).

&gt;##3. What post has made you question parenthood?

&gt;&gt;**CarneCongenitals**  I'm only 21 and not a parent

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8** I wouldn't say any of these posts have made me question parenthood. Kids do odd things

&gt;##4. What if any lesson have you learned from browsing /r/FutureWorldLeaders?

&gt;&gt;**CarneCongenitals** Kids are always learning how the world works

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8** Never trust an angry caterpillar.

&gt;##5. Tell us about your community!

&gt;&gt;**CarneCongenitals** It's lighthearted and funny. Each new submission is exciting because you know it will be great to watch.

&gt;&gt;**TheJackal8** Our community is based around the silly things kids do and the way they act. It's a new perspective because sometimes we'll see a kid do something stupid and we'll get a laugh out of it but this sub makes you realize some day the kid who is running away from a fish may lead the world.

The beauty of CrossFit is that you don't have to be [Mr. Sexy McBuffArms](http://www.mensfitness.com/sites/mensfitness.com/files/imagecache/node_page_image/article_images/crossfit-helen_main.jpg) to start doing CrossFit, but I still do my WODs 4-5 times a week with the rest of my crew. Post work-out, more often than not I end up [on the floor in a pool of my own misery](http://i.imgur.com/WASjqbT.jpg) and phlegm (I spit up approx. 8 oz of spit/workout),  but I'm [definitely not the only one](http://www.crossfitatlanta.com/.a/6a00d8341c0a1d53ef0115722e56a4970b-800wi) and I'll always probably end up so exhausted because the workouts get progressively harder as you abilities grow. That's just what CrossFit does: it challenges you to try your damndest to finish and not die, no matter your [skill level](http://community.crossfit.com/sites/default/files/Community_TeddyKim_floater2.jpg) or [age](http://www.crossfitatlanta.com/.a/6a00d8341c0a1d53ef0120a6f1afec970b-800wi). 

""Why would anyone want to subject themselves to such torture?"" you may be asking yourself.

Well friend, your stupid decision to try it, and your pansy-ass muscles which will probably fail you during your first WOD. Afterwards, though... something happens. Your brain starts analyzing your performance and tricking you into wanting to do it again with the thoughts like  ""well, if I had just walked a little less, I could've finished faster..."" The next thing you know, you're in the gym

It's an awesome thing to become addicted to fitness, which is probably why CrossFit has a bit of a rep for being a [cult](http://www.rxweekendwarrior.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/22150432.jpg). Of course, such a reputation [doesn't phase them at all](http://workoutwithcrossfit.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120722-145255.jpg).

/r/CrossFit is home for all such self-proclaimed cultists. Here they [discuss WODs](http://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/1a92a7/132/), there's not as much activity there as you might think, but that's probably because most all of them are too busy [getting fit](http://www.crossfitboyntonbeach.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_m7ffvdwAu51qjxsrno1_1280.jpg) to sit around on Reddit all day talking about it. As a result, you'll still see some small but [quality conversations](http://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/1a6tjr/just_finished_my_first_wod_i_hated_it/) and [discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/1akweu/josh_golden_speaks_about_his_2013_reebok_crossfit/) regarding CrossFit.

Here today to talk to us more about /r/CrossFit is mod **/u/kinokonoko**. Quick



&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/CrossFit?

&gt;&gt;After being a regular contributor

&gt;2.What drew you to CrossFit over any other fitness program?

&gt;&gt;All my life I have been searching for that perfect fitness and diet lifestyle - I tried everything - martial arts, etc. 

&gt;&gt;Yet as I headed into my 30s
&gt;&gt;Along came crossfit. I embraced the approach and the food choices and long after I gave up having a decent looking physique and resigned myself to the world of fat old men

&gt;3.What is your favorite WOD and why? 

&gt;&gt;[Grace](http://wp.crossfitprototype.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/grace.jpg) - short

&gt;4.Are any of you competing in the 2013 CrossFit Games? 

&gt;&gt;Yes I am registered for the Open and have since the beginning. I also compete locally.

&gt;5.Any advice for someone interested in getting into CrossFit?

&gt;&gt;Don't be afraid of the people there. Most gyms are positive life communities welcoming to all.

&gt;&gt;Take it slow and focus on good form. You'll have plenty of time to be a beast.

&gt;6.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Thanks for being great. There isn't much drama or work to being a mod here.

Questions, or so idiot it makes you consider to commit a murder.     
These are questions which occur in a ""normal"" conversation between two or more people.      
But questionmarks are not only occuring inside a conversation. The whole universe has them.    
What is [good](http://i.imgur.com/tcE6V.jpg) and what is [bad](http://i.imgur.com/i2it8.jpg)? Is our future destined?    
They become complex problems

Welcome to the world of philosophy.

But not many people know that philosophy can be pretty difficult.
So what are you gonna do when you have answers about philosophy?    
Who you gonna call? This time ghostbusters can't help you.


No
At /r/AskPhilosophy graduated philosophers and dedicated amateurs team up to answer all your questions regarding philosophy. If it is about a philosophical school assignment or if a philosophical
poblem doesn't make sense to you

Now a philosophical interview where questions are getting answered about a subreddit where philosophical questions about philosophy are getting answered

&gt;##1.What makes this subreddit unique? 
&gt;&gt;    **drunkentune**    There's a good hardcore group of dedicated philosophy professionals, and autodidacts that are dedicated to answering any and all questions that have to do with philosophy. I'm unaware of any other subreddit that intentionally cultivates such a group. 
 

&gt;##2.How did this subreddit got born? 
&gt;&gt;    **drunkentune**     blackstar9000 and I spoke briefly about repurposing this abandoned subreddit about one year ago

&gt;##3.What do you like the most about philosophy?
&gt;&gt;    **drunkentune**    I     like     most     the critical attitude of some of the best philosophers; the difficulty
&gt;&gt;    **drunken40tonight**    I enjoy the rigor and inquisitiveness of philosophy.  Many of the initial questions that concern philosophers are familiar to most people, and epistemology; what turns that initial question into good philosophy is the dogged manner in which the question is explored, analyzed, critiqued, formalized, defended, compared
More generally, allows you to say your way through the morass.  You don't always end up with a clear answer, but you do end up with specifying precisely what the options are, what motivates the various options, and where the real conflict lies.
I also thoroughly enjoy learning the origin of the ideas that have come to pervade contemporary culture.  You hear a lot of people talk of “rights,” or “science.”  But what's often missing from most people's understanding of these terms is the hard-fought historical and philosophical battles that went into getting us the meaning of these sorts of terms.  In doing philosophy, you 1) come to see how and why we think the way we do, 2) what we take for granted, and 3) how and why we might begin to think differently.  Finally, and just generally, doing philosophy teaches you how to entertain ideas without responding in a sort of knee-jerk way.  I think it's very valuable to be able have your most cherished beliefs called into question without getting offended.

&gt;##4.Which question do you want to be answered? What do you think is the answer? 
&gt;&gt;    **drunkentune**    
&gt;&gt;     1. Which theory of truth ought we adopt? Tarski's correspondence theory seems right
2. Is the intersubjective interpretation of the probability calculus reducible to a subjective interpretation? I think it does
3. How exactly is one to resolve Kripkenstein's rule-following paradox? Any answer I give will most likely be unsatisfactory to others.     
&gt;&gt;     **drinka40tonight**    The issues I'm most interested in focus on ethics and related fields.  One sort of question I'm very concerned about is what it is for an action to be intentional? Lots of issues arise here. Most people think that the guy who loads one bullet in his revolver, fires the gun, and in fact kills the enemy has done so intentionally. Most people also think that the guy needs to roll a 6 on a 6-side die to win a bet, and in fact does roll a 6, does not do so intentionally. So, what's going on here?  Or, we might think that we can specify a “belief-desire” pair that captures the intention. The idea here is that a person acts intentionally if 1) the person has a desire for something and 2) the person believes that acting in a certain way will bring that something about. But this too has lots of problems.  For instance
**A climber might want to rid himself of the weight and danger of holding another man on a rope, and yet it might be the case that he never chose to loosen his hold, nor did he do so intentionally.**
So, and even though the climber’s desire to loosen his hold caused him to do so, we still would not say that when the climber loosened his hold he did so intentionally.  To correctly determine an agent’s intention then, we need to not just identify the desires and beliefs that caused an action, but we must also be able to specify that the desires and beliefs caused the action in the right way– perhaps through some chain of reasoning. And this leads to further questions. So, this is one sort of issue I have an interest in.
Other issues I'm interested in include things like: what is the nature of normativity? What is the epistemological grounding for normative claims? Is the grounding for ethical claims different in kind from the grounding of

&gt;##5.Would you like to say anything?
&gt;&gt;    **drunkentune**   Hi!

Happy tuesday!(?)

This post is not going to be like any other post I've done because this is a very special sub

Extra Life lets gamers hold their own 24-hour gaming marathons (think Relay for Life

Gamers can either participate on their suggested gaming marathon date (**this year's is being held today, though that's definitely a plus. Just pledge your time, play your game of choice on your platform of choice, and watch the charity money roll in. According the extra-life.org's website, participants have raised over 2 million dollars over the past 4 years of this charity's existence, which is pretty impressive in my humble little poor person opinion! 


""Why is there a subreddit for this, and /r/ExtraLife is how they organize, communicate and participate. Anyone can join team Reddit and anyone can donate to the team's efforts, just specify that you want to join or find a team Reddit member to donate to.

Currently, [great job guys!](http://images.persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/uexc_attach/deandance.gif)

If you're interested in seeing what your fellow Redditors are playing for their marathons today


Today we have an interview with **Reddit and r/ExtraLife mod /u/alienth

&gt;1.What inspired you to create r/ExtraLife

&gt;&gt;**alienth** Prior to my job reddit, /u/JeromyAtCMNHospitals.

&gt;2.Tell me more about this charity gaming marathon on October 20th. How can Redditors get involved and how can they get sponsors?

&gt;&gt;**alienth** Extra Life works like any other charity marathon

&gt;&gt;Anyone can join by simply signing up on [Extra Life's website](http://www.extra-life.org/). The marathon officially starts on Oct 20th at 8AM local time


&gt;3.I see that the sub was created a year ago. Did you all participate last year

&gt;&gt;**alienth** I created it last year

&gt;4.How many people are in Team Reddit this year

&gt;&gt;**alienth** We're up to 725 members in Team reddit. Our goal was to raise $50,351.12 raised. Most donations to the event tend to happen the day before and the day of the marathon, so I'm hopeful we'll keep soaring past our goal.

&gt;5.Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**alienth** Just thanks to everyone for participating and/or donating. This is a great event for a very worthy cause.

I didn't know if I would have enough time
Employment has, it beats not having any money.

On a semi-unrelated note, who is a devout practicing Hindu, a bacon egg and cheese burrito instead of his requested diet compliant potato egg and cheese. He bit into it, and soon realized the mistake I had made, spitting up and entire mouthful of burrito into the nearest trash can. He went to the bathroom for a good 10 mins after that. I kinda felt bad.

You've all felt it. 

Your favorite song is playing. The ambient pre-chorus begins.

 *Ahhhhhh Ohhhhhhhh*. 

Stirring words and heavy

You can feel your body begin to get a little light, but just beyond your grasp. 

And then it happens. A wave. A soft shiver. A release.

It is in these moments that we feel most human, if only for a fleeting blip. 

Listen to the segregated vocal selection from the song [""Killer Queen"" by Queen](http://squidtestes.tumblr.com/post/18506707572/thenextdragonborn-mastur88ing-cucumberer) and tell me you don't get a few chills. 

This short, a colliding of the physical and the metaphysical.

Science speculates this ""shiver"" we experience, speeches, pictures and other media is caused, like other ""good"" feelings, by dopamine levels in the brain.

In 2008
an icy fresh taste of something blue and and addictive. Breaking Bad
one of the best shows of recent times
television today.

Right now the show is in its fourth of five seasons and is hotter than ever.
Continually winning Emmys
fans-alike

The show lends itself perfectly to weekly discussion as a subreddit. The 
painstaking cliffhangers
insanely exciting television
is: find out what other redditors are saying!

/r/BreakingBad hosts a weekly discussion as the show airs
chat for even more real-time discussion
week with questions about the show
of course a healthy serving of memes!

The subreddit is home to 5
to reach upwards of 4-6k unique viewers.

If you're a fan of Breaking Bad
hell are you doing?

If you're *not* a fan of Breaking Bad -- well
doing?

Of course

----

&gt; The subreddit has only been around for about 1.5 years
into the 4th season now. What can you guys tell me about the beginning of the
subreddit

&gt;&gt; **coopnl**

&gt;&gt; I didn't start watching the show until about 2 weeks before the premiere of the 3rd season. I watched the first season in 2 days and then proceeded to watch season 2 in time for the premiere. I noticed that there was no subreddit for BB so I thought, this subreddit wouldn't be nearly as awesome as it is. Those guys have so much talent.

&gt;&gt; **sanchokeep33**

&gt;&gt; I came onto r/breakingbad just before the third season started its run, however you feel about the show, was an awesome place to come and theorize, joke and talk about the weeks episode with a bunch of people passionate enough to seek us out.

&gt;&gt; LOST was the first show

&gt;&gt; At that point we started doing IRC chats live during the eps, and a place where you could call someone a bitch as a term of endearment.

&gt;&gt; edify, and added spectacular features and made this sub one of the best gems on reddit.

&gt; Like I said
Any thoughts on where the season is headed (obviously no spoilers)? 
Any particularly favourite characters or sub-plots this year?

&gt;&gt; **edify**

&gt;&gt; Let's focus on the future. The series is ending next season with a huge order of episodes. I think that is great! Does anyone remember how The Sopranos ended? I'm glad they are avoiding something like that. Many shows suffer from season 7 syndrome.

&gt;&gt; **sanchokeep33**

&gt;&gt; This show keeps getting deeper and darker

&gt;&gt; **coopnl**

&gt;&gt; I'm loving the 4th season so far. I can't make any predictions as to what happens but I'm sure that it will be a hell of a cliffhanger. Jesse is still my favorite character but I am also becoming attached to Gus and am interested to see how the season turns out for him

&gt; Tell me about your awesome subreddit design! ;)

&gt;&gt; **coopnl**

&gt;&gt; I had nothing to do with the subreddit design but I would like to that BauerUK and the other mods for everything they have done to make this subreddit look as great as it does.

&gt;&gt; **edify**

&gt;&gt; Well, where I eventually met BauerUK. He is a very talented coder and I invited him to join our modteam over at r/BreakingBad. What does he do next? A week before Breaking Bad's season 4 permier episode, he delivers to us a fully customized new theme for our subreddit! BauerUK is one of my favorite redditors.

&gt;&gt; **sanchokeep33**

&gt;&gt; That CSS theme that blew us all away

&gt; Aww, edify! 

&gt; For fans of the show who aren't aware of the subreddit
it their top priority to come on over to /r/breakingbad? What are they missing?

&gt;&gt; **sanchokeep33**

&gt;&gt; We’re the best place on the internet to talk about the best show on the tv box. Bar none.

&gt;&gt; **edify**

&gt;&gt;  I like to think that we are the best online community that focuses on Breaking Bad. We have a community member that live streams the episodes and we try to always create an episode discussion thread as soon as it begins airing.

&gt;&gt; **coopnl**

&gt;&gt; This subreddit provides some great conversation about each episode and some of the topics that get posted are so entertaining. I think that people who are a fan of the show would love this subreddit.

&gt; There are likely going to be some people reading this who haven't seen the 
show or have never heard of Breaking Bad (crazy
should stop what they're doing and start watching.

&gt;&gt; **edify**

&gt;&gt; AMC has broken new ground in the cable TV industry reguarding original series. HBO did it first circa 1999 and Showtime followed shortly thereafter. Those channel both require a subscription. AMC has changed everything with Mad Men, etc.

&gt;&gt; **sanchokeep33**

&gt;&gt; This is a show that is unmatched on TV, but is used often to tell a visually rich and engrossing story. Watch the first episode and try not to get sucked in. Best TV pilot I’ve ever seen.

&gt;&gt; **coopnl**

&gt;&gt; Anybody who has not watched an episode of Breaking Bad is missing out! Even my wife who was totally against the premise of the show will sit down with me and watch it

&gt; It's been circulated recently that next year will be the final season of the
show. That's a huge decision for any show
ending the story better than others (*cough*Lost*cough*). Firstly
think ending a show like Breaking Bad will go down? And are you happy that
there will be some sort of conclusive mark left on the show?

&gt;&gt; **sanchokeep33**

&gt;&gt; From what I understand, there’s an end date for Vince and the writers to work towards. There’s no smoke monster, and the bald man hasn’t been resurrected as a mysterious villain. I think that the way BB is going to end is with a huge amount of alliances and orientations shifted from where they started, and a number of threats are going to come to a head in a violent and explosive way.

&gt;&gt; **coopnl**

&gt;&gt; As great as a show Breaking Bad is

&gt; Sort of tied to the idea of the show ending
die down on the subreddit after that. I know some of you guys have other 
projects lined up
eye's on that we might be talking about soon?

&gt;&gt; **edify**

&gt;&gt;  After Breaking Bad I will personally be focusing on AMC's The Walking Dead, and their upcoming new series Hell on Wheels. I think it's great that they are ending Breaking Bad with an extra long final season. 

&gt;&gt; **sanchokeep33**

&gt;&gt; As far as new shows on the horizon

735 Timelords scribing for 4 months

----

For those of you who didn't know, a writing system based on the gallifreyan language in Doctor Who.  I wanted to write up an incredibly nifty introduction for this, but the interview became too long.  I'll just get right into the good stuff and let the two mods (/u/pcjonathan and /u/DevilChicken), along with a special guest,   /u/TheInventor, explain everything.  Don't worry - no spoilers.

----

&gt;Fantastic! What's the history of Circular Gallifreyan?

&gt;&gt;**pcjonathan**:  Well...the language (or ""code"" would be a better way of describing it) didn't start till very recently. It has a fairly long history as a whole but in short:
&gt;&gt;In the TV Show Doctor Who, who live on Gallifrey. They have 3 types of language. Old High Gallifreyan, Modern High Gallifreyan and Circular Gallifreyan. All these have featured throughout the series but never have had the same style that can be translated or used, etc. See more on this [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Gallifreyan_(language\)).

&gt;&gt;I'm not entirely sure about the exact history of Sherman's version of it behind the scenes, I just didn't have the time to learn how to do it. So many weeks past and it got more and more popular and I started seeing it submitted to /r/DoctorWho a lot. I began to learn it slowly, still lacking on time. It was at this point in time where I saw loads of posts swarming the /r/DoctorWho subreddit where I gave /u/DevilChicken the idea of creating a subreddit for it. (Yes...Mr Chicken...I will keep a hold of that and Yes...I will call you Mr Chicken) to start one. I felt like doing it myself, sure, but at the time I was doing exams and had to unexpectedly take over being the Admin of Combom and still had to deal with other things so I couldn't.  A month later, when things calmed down, I decided to join and to start planning on making things even better! :)

&gt;&gt;**TheInventor**:  In terms of the fanmade script, so I posted a rudimentary guide animation to my website. When it came to naming the alphabet, someone noted that it resembled the Circular Gallifreyan from Doctor Who. I modified the script and called it ""Gallifreyan"" and somehow the link must have gotten passed around because next thing I knew my website had been crashed by hordes of rampaging Doctor Who fans. Once I recovered from the initial shock and got my site back up, I devoted a section of it to the alphabet and wrote up a more official guide. I also started work on a translator, although that remains unfinished due to schoolwork. Since then, my work has been promoted on deviantART, tumblr, and of course

&gt;&gt;**DevilChicken**:   Well

&gt;What makes it so awesome to learn? Can a non-Whovian learn it?

&gt;&gt;**pcjonathan**:  Ooh..That's a toughie. The greatest appeal it would be is for Whovians out there as it is, but that's what the subreddit is for! The only problem for non-Whovians would be, there's a tad less of an ""Epic"" feel to it and most of the quotes we use are from Doctor Who (Such as the ""He's like fire and Ice..."" speech) so you may miss out a little. Most people like doing Doctor Who related things with it. So watch Doctor Who too!

&gt;&gt;**TheInventor**:  Being the teacher and not the learner, I see stars and gas giants. I see planets and moons and rings. I see the totality of art and language and mathematics combined into a form that sings to all of my faculties. When I write I am scribing the universe."" They, in turn, go on to quote Doctor Who: “There were days, there were many days, where these words could burn stars, raise up empires

&gt;&gt;**DevilChicken**:  This language is awesome to learn because it is genuinely fun to write in. I have a good time and it is very relaxing. Anybody could learn CG

&gt;What would you like to see more of in /r/gallifreyan as a subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**pcjonathan**:  Little more activity. But that's a little calling the kettle black lately if I am being honest. It seems to come in waves. I tell you one thing that would be great...and that is a CSS expert to say hello. Unfortunately

&gt;&gt;**TheInventor**:  I'd have to agree, as well as recommending that people post their inquiries in the subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**DevilChicken**:  It would be great if the community was a bit more active, and I suppose that I should be doing a better job of pumping blood into it if I want it to work as a whole, but...minecraft.

&gt;Have you seen gallifreyan work with other languages besides English?

&gt;&gt;**pcjonathan**:  Haha. Actually. Yes. Once. In Latin. It's this one I believe. As I only know English (that's a whole story in itself), or even any words of it. And when the author doesn't put what it's supposed to be, there's not much else I can do.
The downside of trying to do a foreign language is that many of the letters are impossible to do. Hell

&gt;&gt;**TheInventor**:  I've seen a piece or two in Latin

&gt;&gt;**DevilChicken**:  I have not, or the umlaut(?) over vowels in German.

&gt;Is there any gallifreyan art work there? It seems like this writing is practically art in itself. This should give you an idea

&gt;&gt;**pcjonathan**:  There's plenty of Gallifreyan work out there. The entire subreddit is full of it. Ranging from a beginners ""Am I doing this right?"" to Mr Chickens own ""[The Pride of my works](http://i.imgur.com/wgKLP.jpg)"".

&gt;&gt;**TheInventor**:  I consider all Gallifreyan to be artwork

&gt;&gt;**DevilChicken**:  Yeah, but that's more calligraphy than anything. So I suppose that fancy CG would be calligraphic.

The interview was too long

Seven years ago, a dog and nothing on the horizon.  Hard times or bad luck, call it what you will.  But here we are in 2005... two Canadians recently exiled from the United States and were forced to move back in with my in-laws in the most rural scene you could imagine.  Hard times?  Totally.  Bad times?  Not really because these fine folks simply love their daughter (my wife) and wanted to see us happy.  Their house became our house, their stuff was our stuff.  

So when you live with your inlaws, how to vacate so that everyone gets some alone time.  This was the year I took up running, took up hiking, this was also the year I met the man I affectionately called ""Chicken John"".

I got to know Chicken John during my daily excursions.  In my efforts to keep things copacetic at the in-laws house, but I've been known to cause TMJ (too much Johnny).  So every day around 3 pm I would take my girl, Ariadne, and head out to Union Road, turn left on Lakeshore Road and head on over past Chicken John's place.  At first, I saw him once or twice a week.  But after a month, I think he got to know my schedule and I saw him every day.

Chicken John was a man as big as a house... 300 pounds if he was an ounce; all bacon fat and positivity.  I would walk past his place and he would come rumbling and tumbling out the front door, ""Johnny!  C'mere Johnny I want you to see this!!""  And I knew that if I stopped, my life would be forever changed.

On his plot of land, award worthy flowers, everything was growing at Chicken John's place.  He would walk me around and show me how everything had grown since the last visit... show me new stuff and share his dreams of future gardens.  When I asked him how he got all these plants he would just laugh until he cried.  ""You don't buy plants,"" he would say, ""you get the seeds from produce!""  The guy would take the seeds from tomatoes, plant all kinds of vegetables based on the seeds from stuff he once ate.  He knew how to dry out the seeds and grow his own vegetables.  It was amazing!

I made it to his house pretty much every day for stories about his garden.  Here he was, all the vegetables in the world and a great story every day.  I never did say goodbye when we moved, but our friendship is something I'll always treasure.

&gt;&gt;With Fall, wonder no more! Now is the best time to get into gardening for a couple reasons. You have time to plan your spring projects and educate yourself on what it will take to accomplish them. Fall is also a great time for planting perennials, trees and bulbs like tulips or garlic.

#/r/whyineedtoberich

A community for **4 months** with **1

Like most of you, wandering through the supermarket, casually tipping items into my shopping cart, not a care in the world as to their price or weight as I have both a fat wallet to pay for them and a phat automobile to ferry them to my lavishly appointed house. Maybe not a house. I haven’t decided. I mean, there will be a house eventually for when I get old and want to walk around the grounds or receive guests. But maybe before that an apartment or two. Somewhere cool like New York, or London. Is New York still cool? Wherever the coolness is at the time of purchase. 


I might be dangerously deluded, [a Steinway model D]( http://i42.servimg.com/u/f42/12/02/89/83/dsc01710.jpg) would be very near the top of the list (although I’ve been hearing good things about Fazioli), but you might prefer a sports car or a book or something. I dunno. Whatever you’re particular affluence fetish is, today’s featured subreddit has it covered.
/r/WhyINeedToBeRich is dedicated solely to photos of very expensive, and is symbiotically related to the very pretty and seemingly advertisement-free website www.thisiswhyineedtoberich.com, which is also run by butihatecats. 
Here is the man himself to give us a taste of life in the penthouse suite:


&gt;## Why did you create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; I thought that more people should see the awesome photos of awesome stuff

&gt;## Where did you get all those cool pictures?

&gt;&gt; I collect them from blogs and websites.

&gt;## What is the most extravagant thing you have ever bought?

&gt;&gt; It must be a Jaguar XJR, only had it for two years, but I’ve still got the Rolex.

&gt;## If a genie was going to grant you any one luxury item in the world

&gt;&gt; A huge yacht or a private island in the Bahamas.

&gt;## Why should one subscribe to /r/WhyINeedToBeRich?

&gt;&gt; So that you know what to spend the money on when that long-lost relative dies!

Good evening ladies and gentlemen!  Thanks for inviting me to perform at the first of many fund raisers for Redditors Without Borders!  You know

No?  Alright, outside of the Oscars, people don't toss around that word ""snubbed"", except maybe at a bris!  You know, with the moyle and the hooooo!  Okay.  How about television?  Any fans of Law and Order: SVU out there?  You sir?  Okay, *security!!*  Because, you know

RWB is the most suggested subreddit we've seen in a long time, you're welcome to join them... all you gotta do is click the link!

*****

&gt;Welcome Scuby22

&gt;&gt;You'll find a great group of Redditors interested in helping people all around the world. That can manifest itself in lots of different ways in [/r/rwb](/r/rwb); sharing knowledge, financial contributions, and highlighting issues important to them.

&gt;What's the goal of your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Redditors Without Borders is dedicated to helping people, and bring solutions to people all around the world. 

&gt;Where do you see yourself in a year (a millennium in internet years).

&gt;&gt;""A Millennium in Internet Years"" is actually describes a big challenge for [/r/rwb](/r/rwb). Most significant projects take more than a year to complete

&gt;&gt;A year from now we hope to have some great success stories under our belt, evaluating, and getting involved in projects, and have our website up and running.

&gt;Can you explain the [Project Request] posts?

&gt;&gt;[PROJECT REQUEST] is our current system for people requesting help. It let's everyone know ""HEY - CHECK THIS OUT - I NEED HELP"" In the very near future

&gt;&gt;As an example [KNOWLEDGE] - Letting everyone know that someone needs some expertise with a project. RWB has already helped provide knowledge with some water projects in Kenya, and tons of others.

&gt;&gt;Please introduce yourselves - tell us a bit about you!

&gt;&gt;**Scuby22** - I'm an environmental engineer that works around the globe in drinking water treatment projects (50+ countries so far). I love to travel

&gt;&gt;**Denny-Crane** - I am an operations manager for a transportation company who believes that reddit has tremendous potential to do good for the world through collaboration that might not otherwise happen. I sit on the board of a non-profit dedicated to building and improving sustainable infrastructure in distressed neighborhoods and the developing world as well as working on this and other reddit-driven fundraising initiatives

&gt;&gt;**puredemo** - I'm a software developer and project manager living in the San Francisco Bay Area; I have spent the last few years working on the development of several non-profit web portals. In my free time

&gt;Alright

Admittedly

But I think there's something disquieting about the modern McMansion. Something hollow

It's not just for those reasons I chose /r/TinyHouses as Subreddit of the Day. I certainly the admire the creativity of it all, and filling a house with only a few hundred square feet. Seeing the work of others always fuels my own imagination. I mean, who of us hasn't wanted to live in a tree house at one point or another? And Bubbles from TPB made shed life look *really awesome*. 

In conclusion: No, take some time to think about a simpler life, whatever that means to you.

&gt;What first got you interested in tiny housing? Do you live in a tiny house yourself?

&gt;&gt;A few years ago while watching Youtube videos about being green and simple living I came across one on Jay Shafer and his tiny house. I don't live in a tiny house yet but I do have plans on building one.

&gt;What seem to be the biggest design challenges in small housing?

&gt;&gt;Storage space. You'll need to be able to pare down your belongings and adopt a more minimalistic lifestyle or be climbing over clutter to get around.

&gt;What are the benefits of small housing?

&gt;&gt;There are plenty of benefits of small house living ranging from a low or no mortgage and utility bills cut to just a few dollars

&gt;What do you like/look for in a tiny house?

&gt;&gt;Believe it or not

&gt;What are some of the coolest houses you've seen so far in this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Some of the coolest tiny houses I've seen thus far are the tree houses.

well, our **interview** is with the mod and creator of the subreddit: [***Zueter***](http://www.reddit.com/user/Zeuter)!!!!!

***THE INTERVIEW***

&gt;1.) How did r/adventuretime come to be? Why create the most adventurous sub on the internet?
&gt;&gt; After having seen the ""[pilot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsUlCH1xmC4&amp;feature=youtu.be)"" years before, I watched lots of episodes with my friends at our annual outdoor summer LAN party, where everyone loved it as well. Since it was a week-long LAN, and there wasn't much else to do besides internet, videogames, swimming and general slacking off (do I long for those days), the connection was easily made. I made the Adventure Time subreddit - after being surprised for finding that it didn't exist yet - and ever since then the people have kept coming and posting more and more.

&gt;2.) What totally lucrative adventures should people expect to find in r/adventuretime?
&gt;&gt; Initially, stills from the show, gifs and pictures of people finding AT-related things in real life, in addition to threads in which people discuss the latest episodes became more popular. This Halloween, the subreddit was absolutely flooded with costume pictures, to which I responded by renaming it ""The official Adventure Time Halloween costume subreddit"". That probably won't stay up for very long though.
/r/adventuretime is, low-quality entries, but as a moderator I leave them be. Downvote and hide, everyone!

&gt;3.) Would you share some your favorite Adventure Time gifs
&gt;&gt; *""Wait dude
That's one of Jake's first lines. Story of my life.

&gt;4.) If you could be any character on the show
&gt;&gt; Why


&gt;5.) Anything you want to say to the subscribers of r/adventuretime?
&gt;&gt; I'm looking for someone to create a totally math theme for /r/adventuretime
Also, will probably appeal to many people who enjoy Adventure Time. If you need help getting started,[ /r/dwarffortress](http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/) will help you on your way.

&gt;6.) Any other information you would like to add about the subreddit?
&gt;&gt;  Right, and the main reason we need any moderation at all is because the spamfilter is too strict. Cheers to the community for behaving so well!

Thanks again to Zueter for the great interview. I think he will be hanging around in the comments, feel free to put them down there. I hope you guys have liked today's write up!

We at /r/subredditoftheday really love space. We feature a space related subreddit nearly every month

APOD is a website dedicated to images related to space

APOD was first launched on the web over 18 years ago, the site received very little attention; over the years it's popularity rose and currently the site has received at least a billion pageviews. One of the endearing characteristics of the site is its tendency to feature spectacular false color telescopic images, such as [the Eagle Nebula](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130714.html) and the [Horsehead Nebula.](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130503.html) Recently APOD has been featuring a lot of ground based long exposure photography such as this [image of the Milky Way galaxy over Crater Lake, OR.](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130619.html) One of the most interesting types of image they have featured are those where the camera is located far away from Earth, like [yesterday's submission.](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130723.html)

I spoke with Wyboth who has been maintaining the APOD subreddit. 

&gt;1) APOD is a great NASA resource. Have you interacted with NASA or showed them your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Wyboth:** Robert Nemiroff (one of the editors of APOD) has seen the subreddit and likes it. He's the only one at NASA whom I've shown the subreddit to.

&gt;2) What are your favourite APOD submissions?

&gt;&gt;**Wyboth:** Ooh, but my all-time favourite would have to be the [Engraved Hourglass Nebula](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110807.html). It gives me chills whenever I look at it. I also liked the infrared portrait of the [Large Magellanic Cloud](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130323.html), [Asperatus Clouds over New Zealand](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130227.html), and of course the first image from [Curiosity](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120807.html).

&gt;3) What is your astronomical background?

&gt;&gt;**Wyboth:**  At the time of writing, I volunteer at my local planetarium, so I know the night sky like the back of my hand, as well as many astronomy topics. If it counts for anything, I also took an astronomy class in high school, and I keep up with current astronomical events. When I graduate high school next year, I plan on majoring in physics and minoring in astronomy.

&gt;4)  What about astronomy captures your interest?

&gt;&gt;**Wyboth:** Exoplanets. It's fascinating to think that there are other planets like our own orbiting other stars

Deadmau5 (aka Joel Zimmerman) is pretty much one of the front runners in progressive house and ambient house music. If you haven’t heard this guys stuff yet

“OH BAT KNAGA I DANT LIEK SHITTE TEKNO LIEK DED MOW 5” Well... ok then. Everyone has their own opinions, kiddo. But what about the music? If that music was a person I would marry it. Ya know, because I love it.

But in all seriousness, 4x4=12 is very different from his other stuff, it has more poppy synth beats that sound great (yummy, synths), and his music from Random Album Title is more focused on progression and melody and doesn’t rely on synthesizers, just good ol’ melodic music (NOT EXACTLY IS SO DAMN TASTY). 

Any of those people with a good memory can remember that I featured /r/DaftPunk not too long ago, yes, I’m a huge fan of Joel and I wish to go to one of his shows, because it will just be amazing. I own all his CD’s except for the first two albums he released (yes that includes the extra disc on &gt; album title goes here &lt;) and the Meowingtons Hax 2k11 DVD and I’m patiently waiting for his next album, whenever that happens. But I’ll tell you who are bigger fans than me, the guys on this subreddit. Compared to them, I’m just a newbie at this stuff, which is the one and only deadmau5. Keep being tasty guys! Should we have an interview with the mods of this subreddit? I think we shall. 

&gt;##1. Why did you create /r/deadmau5?
&gt;&gt;**/u/chizdippler** I didn't create the subreddit

&gt;&gt;**/u/Jon2397** /u/jesuslol created it

&gt;##2. What is your favourite deadmau5 album and/or song?
&gt;&gt;**chizdippler** Personally

&gt;&gt;**Jon2397** My personal favorite is I Remember

&gt;##3. Are you pleased with the fans that are subscribed on this subreddit?
&gt;&gt;**chizdippler** We are definitely very pleased with the fans that are subscribed here. They provide constant

&gt;&gt;**Jon2397** Yeah, and etc.

&gt;##4. What's a good thing about moderating a subreddit like this?
&gt;&gt;**chizdippler** A good thing about moderating this kind of subreddit is that you get to help out a community that you have a deep interest in. Since reddit is the front page of the internet and Joel Zimmerman (deadmau5) is a techie, have somewhat of a voice.

&gt;&gt;**Jon2397** It's a pretty great feeling to moderate something that you really love. I'm 16 now

&gt;##5. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt;**chizdippler** To our subscribers: Thank you so much for subscribing to /r/deadmau5 and never failing to provide interesting and informative content to everyone else! This subreddit is a huge success because of it.

/r/gonenatural is the subreddit that nearly got away.  This place has been rockin' photos of beautiful women for over a year now and I can't believe we're just getting to it now!  Much like [Fitz and the Tantrums](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3WRXYYBwRA&amp;feature=list_related&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=ALYL4kY05133oJel-eJPM1vkXrzG8zOzOi), but soon as I'm done this write up I'm punishin' you with Monster Garage episodes.

/r/gonenatural is a pretty supportive, ""dem eyebrowz"", you'll be glad you checked out today's Subreddit of the Day.

Here to present /r/gonenatural is Ra_

&gt;Please tell us the backstory. How did /r/gonenatural get started?

&gt;&gt;Hi. I start a lot of subreddits whenever the whim strikes me. None of them near as popular as this. I modded a girl when I started but she was clogging the subreddit with images of generic girls

&gt;Compare and contrast /r/gonenatural and /r/gonewild. In what ways are they similar? How are they different?

&gt;&gt;The name is a takeoff on the gonewild trend but is nothing like that community. Strictly g rated.

&gt;So why no boobs? Why no gents?

&gt;&gt;No boobs because my intent is to counter the brainwashing that girls get from birth telling them that they need makeup. We have young submitters and any suggestive or insulting commenters are banned instantly.

&gt;How'd your first year go? Is there anything you'd like to change? Anything you're working on?

&gt;&gt;Don't plan on changing a thing.

&gt;Last paragraph is yours - do you have anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Many girls won't ever leave home without makeup. We reward the brave naked faces with praise and we harshly reject any frauds who continually try to sneak in with minimal makeup. It's a deliberate reversal of the propaganda females are faced with in this world. We're trying to make girls feel guilty when they put makeup on

&gt;&gt;I would add that I feature a 'Buy American' link in my sidebar because doing so is one of the few remaining ways for me to show my patriotism in a warmongering country where the elite are rewarded,,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,True

Interesting things I learned about yoga from the internet...

1.  Yoga is a form of exercise which is about 5,"" loosely translated from the Sanskrit language, means ""union."" Yoga poses involve a combination of stretching, breathing and mental relaxation (meditation). 

2.  In 2008

3.  One in 10 Americans now practice yoga.

4.  There are approximately 100 big styles of yoga - my favourite

5.  “Doga” is a type of yoga in which people use yoga to achieve harmony with their canine pets.  There's a place in the Seattle area where you can do yoga with your horse

6.  Pro athletes have long been using yoga.  In a 2010 survey, New York Giants, and Chicago Cubs admitted to using yoga for training.

7.  Yup

****

So today's subreddit adds support to the comment we hear most often, in fact, I was simply blown away when I found [/r/Yoga](/r/Yoga) and learned that there was just over five thousand subscribers?  Could this place have been lost in the shuffle?  Perhaps so.  Don't get me wrong, this is still an incredibly active subreddit - tons of posts each day, lots of interesting stuff, great comments... but only five thousand, five hundred subscribers?  Inconceivable!  

But enough of that, I see your problem:  not enough cats!  Still, I give this place a strong two thumbs way up!

You belong!  Please join me in celebrating one of reddit's greatest subs, /r/Happy!!  Here's Failcake, to tell us about his happy place.

&gt;Please expain /r/happy. What will we find there?

&gt;&gt;If you look at the front page, to provide posts that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside!

&gt;What's the goal of this community? Where do you think it's headed?

&gt;&gt;The subreddit is dedicated to cheering up redditors and making them, and it's a nice place to go to get away from the troubles of the every day world. At nearly 37k subscribers strong (and growing every day), the amount of heartwarming content people post every day continues to grow.

&gt;Happy is a subjective concept. How do submitters know what qualifies for a good post?

&gt;&gt;In /r/happy, having a child, or even small things such as sticking to your diet for a whole month or meeting a nice girl. But the general rule is, if it makes you happy, it's welcome!

&gt;Does /r/happy have any critics? If so

&gt;&gt;Fortunately /r/happy has been relatively free of drama. The main issue of concern we've had is when users post relatively small things without detailing them at all (e.g. ""I found a penny on the ground!"" with only a title and no further information)

&gt;Thinking about the posts you've received

&gt;&gt;The most noticeable trend I've seen is that people are usually pretty happy after they've analyzed their surroundings/life, stopping to smell the roses so to speak. Cause hey, life is hard. The little things make it awesome. Heck, [one of our most upvoted posts of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m3m4a/went_to_my_daughters_school_and_saw_this_in_her/) is about a parent's young daughter's short paragraph about how if she had a million dollars, she would use it to help the less fortunate. Another one of my favorites is [""You are somebody's reason to masturbate""](http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/obi91/you_are/), which is such a short statement but an uplifting one as well.

&gt;What makes you happy?

&gt;&gt;Hmm... tough to answer. Personally,,False,self,t5_2sgno,True,,True

Let's face it: Sometimes reality just isn't enough. After a while, or make our way through an alien jungle?

/r/ImaginaryLandscapes provides intrepid and imaginative redditors with a wealth of scenes- extraterrestrial swamps and towering skyscrapers, I find myself impressed by the complex scenes that appear in IL. In conclusion,lease take some time to visit today's SROTD, and take a stroll through someone else's imagination! (And if you have any of your own works to share, please do! One_Giant_Nostril's submitting finger is getting tired.)

O_G_N

&gt;What inspired you to create /r/ImaginaryLandscapes?

&gt;&gt;About seven weeks after I created /r/ImaginaryMonsters, that I was passing by wonderful and imaginative landscapes by the very same artists. (Usually, talented artists who draw fantastic creatures try their hand at landscapes as well.) It was an entire category of incredible images that simply wouldn't fit under the classification of monsters. So /r/ImaginaryLandscapes was born in order for me to showcase those images. I wanted to share those pictures with fellow redditors who, hopefully, would not only appreciate them as I did, but would also either submit their own or ones they'd come across during their web travels.

&gt;&gt;Monsters are cool, laundry baskets and peanut butter sandwiches.

&gt;What is your personal favorite imaginary place from tv/cinema/literature? Do you prefer futuristic cities

&gt;&gt;My favourite imaginary landscapes on TV is the daily news, that's what my pretend beret-clad girlfriend tells me.) In cinema, of course, everything is scripted, lit, edited, re-shot and packaged to resemble reality. Literature is a foray into a singular artist's mind where you are guided by the hand of the author through a personal landscape of their own making. You are, led through an imaginary landscape composed of and by the author's own neurons.

&gt;Do you have any particular favorite posts?

&gt;&gt;My personal favourite is [""Lost""](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs22/f/2007/322/8/5/Lost_by_kerembeyit.jpg) by Kerem Beyit, as IL is more than nine months old, there were many submitted at the beginning that, in my opinion, suffered from lack of exposure. Such as [""Windhamhill - The Wishing Tree""](http://cghub.com/files/Image/072001-073000/72627/449_max.jpg) by Kerem Gogus, [""Seaside Mountains""](http://community.imaginefx.com/forums/storage/6/173637/islands2.jpg) by Tyler Edlin, his first attempt at a matte painting by the way, [""Desnoyers-Ville""](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs34/f/2008/303/d/4/Desnoyers_Ville_by_fstarno.jpg) by Frederic St-Arnaud

&gt;What would you like to change about your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;I'm very happy that the established and professional artist Noah Bradley has chosen to submit his work. I wish more professional artists would consider doing the same. Perhaps, just as they would to their blog or their website. But I'm not too concerned because as soon as they check their blog or website's traffic stats, they'll soon know the existence and, perhaps most importantly, the exposure-potential of IL. I don't know who specifically subscribes to IL, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn there are industry insiders with the power to hire freelancers.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of ImaginaryLandscapes?

&gt;&gt;I'm very glad submitters have, but within a day that traffic has eased enough for others to get through. As I say, this is a rare occurrence.

&gt;&gt;Other than that, I spend an enormous amount of time each day searching the 'tubes' to find new material. They've also picked up on the unspoken rule that ""bigger is better"" so if they find something worth submitting, they will take the time to search for a bigger version, either through google image search or tineye. Also linking to the image itself instead of the web page where it's found, because having the image fill your monitor has more impact. If someone is interested in pursuing more examples of the artist's work, they can google or duckduckgo the artist's name or find the link to their website in the comments.

Gather round, I feel this to be the one that sits closest to me. I'm a big gamer, and have been partaking in it since I was first old enough to hold a 2600 controller in my tiny hands. Even in the 80s I had great stories to tell, mostly surrounding my favorite game of the decade: NetHack. Today, though I'm going to tell a story a bit more recent.

The year is 2008, and made a lot of cool friends. There was one fight, however, I'll always remember as defining my Halo 3 experience. There was one fight that turned that puny man into a beast named Xavier. This is that fight.

The game is Big Team CTF on Sandtrap. Within the first few minutes, the worst spot to get in when outnumbered. I was locked to my flag, and the enemy was moving in fast. All pretense of logic and plan shut out, I proceeded to deliver what could've became the greatest action movie rampage since Hamburger Hill. Armed only with my Battle Rifle and pistol, I held back a team of 8 for half the game. Eventually, my ammo fell to zero on both fronts. I used the embedded turret to my advantage, but it wasn't versatile enough. I fell

I respawned, ""not while I live.""

They never got the flag back to base.

&gt;#1. What made you decide to create StoriesOfWar?

&gt;&gt;**NullPoint84** I think the tipping point was when Kiaha saw [my thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/xvwtu/lets_hear_your_best_gaming_war_stories/) in /r/truegaming a few months back, like honor, glory, sacrifice, and intrigue. Gamers love to tell and hear the stories that result, and I wanted to create a thread to get everyone together and get them talking.

&gt;&gt;**Kiaha** After reading Nullpoint84's thread I looked around for any subreddit that was dedicated to this (being as there are so many specific subs, and upon hearing a great response I created it, and MightyMofo volunteered to be a mod, and I asked NullPoint84 to help mod and...well, poof! /r/storiesofwar

&gt;&gt;**MightyMofo** You've really gotta give it to Kiaha and NullPoint84 for taking the initiative and having the ideas. I didn't have any ideas; I just saw that Kiaha wanted to make a subreddit

&gt;#2. Overall

&gt;&gt;**NullPoint84** I may be biased just because I'm such a huge fan of the game

&gt;&gt;**NullPoint84** It's so hard to choose, so of course again I'm a bit biased!

&gt;&gt;**Kiaha** Hmmmm, you know?

&gt;&gt;**MightyMofo** You know

&gt;#4. You instantly obtain one object in the world. What is it?

&gt;&gt;**Kiaha** A TF2 key. Seriously

&gt;&gt;**MightyMofo** Does Olivia Wilde's undying love count as an object?

How many times have you bragged about leaving people trapped in a pool with no ladder

/r/thesims is a game that brings out everyone's inner psycho and provides ample evidence that it's not easy to be a divine being.  I once burned a Vampire Sim in the sun because he quit his job when I wasn't looking.  I didn't know I had given my Sims so much free will

Despite the individual game play

I sat down with the mods of /r/thesims to ask them some questions.  While I was tempted to ask them in Simlish, I decided I should stick to English.

&gt;#1. What was the inspiration behind /r/thesims?

&gt;&gt;**stephoswalk** I was searching for my particular interests on Reddit out of boredom.  That's how I discovered that there wasn't a subreddit yet for The Sims games so I created it.  From there

&gt;#2. How long have you been playing The Sims franchise?

&gt;&gt;**stephoswalk** My husband bought me The Sims for Valentine's Day right after it came out in 2000.  I've been playing every incarnation of the game since then including The Sims Online.  I still have all the games and their various expansion and stuff packs.

&gt;#3. What is the one Sims game you cannot live without?

&gt;&gt;**stephoswalk** Right now it's The Sims 3 which is actually paused as I type this.  I'm in the midst of a Sim marathon at the moment

&gt;#4. Do you know any Simlish?  Do you speak it in real life?

&gt;&gt;**stephoswalk** I actually don't know any Simlish because I usually play with the sound off so I can listen to podcasts at the same time.  Right now I'm listening to [How Did This Get Made?](http://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made/)

Don't trust me? StarCraft II eSports superstar commentator Daniel ""Artosis"" Stemkoski has commented many times

For my featurette I was reading the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig) on guinea pigs and I'm really surprised at all the TILs in that one article. Don't worry I'm not regurgitating it. I'm not that smart. But if you want something to melt your heart you gotta hear how they communicate. [Yes with sounds.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig#Behavior)

I have deemed today

&gt;1 When was the first time you saw a guinea pig(s)? And what was your reaction to them?

&gt;&gt;**fragimus_max** When I was around six years-old, in my mid-20's I grew a pair and rescued a five year-old piggy, Ralph, from a neighbor who was just going to set them loose. I had no idea what I'd been missing out on all those years.


&gt; 2 Do you currently own any guinea pig(s)? What are their names and professions.

&gt;&gt;**fragimus_max** First off, and occasionally teaches workshops to other guinea pigs on how to lick without biting. Rusty is currently a professional shit machine, who aspires to one day appear on the television show ""Community"" (please don't tell him the bad news.)

&gt; 3 Hamtaro. Excellent PR or Horrible stereotype casting? (I know Hamtaro was a hamster but its pretty close)

&gt;&gt;**fragimus_max** I've been advised by my guinea pigs not to respond to any question that compares them to other types of rodentia, are even rodents (they lack tails and other traits that would fully categorize them as such.) For the most part, cavies in the media can be a difficult subject to discuss, because they are often misrepresented as snarky sidekicks, video rental salespigs, or spies. While the spy part is actually true, it's a bit alarming that every time a guinea pig is featured as a major character in a movie or television show, and realize that adoption means making a life-long commitment to their welfare.

&gt; 4 Whats your favorite guinea pig(s) picture / video?
&gt;&gt;**fragimus_max** [South Park's ""Pandemic 2: The Startling""](http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s12e11-pandemic-2-the-startling) is a modern masterpiece of guinea pig mayhem.

&gt;##1 How did /r/HeavySeas start and what made you want to start /r/HeavySeas?

&gt;&gt;**SveNss0N** /r/HeavySeas started after someone on Reddit shared a video of a ship fighting massive waves and people seemed to really like that content.

The feedback has been interesting, and I'm always keeping an eye out on the content which has been phenomenal.

&gt;##2 Do you have an experience being at sea?

&gt;&gt;**SveNss0N** I've been deep sea fishing a couple of times myself and have been on a few ships myself but nothing commercial. A lot of them have been ferries

&gt;##3 Is there a favourite post?

&gt;&gt;**SveNss0N** Picking a favourite post is a tough one as we've had some fantastic user-submitted videos on here. I'd be like picking a favourite child. That being said

&gt;##4 Would you like to say anything to your subscribers

**776** listeners for  **9 months**

Hey there fellow redditors. Its your friendly neighborhood man-spider here once again! Bringing you another fantastic feature! I hope you've been enjoying all these new fresh (interns) faces writing these fabulous features for us lately. I know I sure am. These interns are our future! I have full faith in them. Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay we have made it a science to bring you only the best and freshest subreddits for your reading pleasure. If we feature an old or already popular subreddit

On to the meat of the matter. Today's SROTD is none other than /r/Albumaday! Its a really tiny nook of reddit that I'm sure that'll peak your interests. That is if you're into music. And what human being isn't? (Not trying to offend deaf people). Each day someone writes about an album they listened and then give it a mini review with some awesome links. Its really that simple. And if you want to join in the fun its quite easy (read the Q&amp;A).

[Their april fool's post was hilarious](http://www.reddit.com/r/albumaday/comments/1bgfy9/discovery_by_daft_punk_a_war_crime_of_music/). Thats just to show you that they too have a sense of humor. And aren't as uptight as most boring music magazine reviews. Its semi-casual. Like... Hawaiian shirt fridays? Or like... where I work. Where everyday is T-shirt and sneakers day! So give this baby subreddit a chance. It'll grow on ya.

I want to keep this part short since the Q&amp;A got a little long. So without further ado...
 
####**The Q &amp; A section**

&gt;#1. What inspired you to be a part of /r/Albumaday?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ravencrush**  I had a hobby of listening to an album a day and recording my impression of it in a document that acted as a diary of sorts

&gt;&gt; Eventually I graduated to the thought of sharing something like this with other people and since I had already been active on reddit for around a year

&gt;&gt; I looked into names and found /r/albumaday had been inactive since creation and didn't have an owner so I requested it from the admins and  the rest is history.

&gt;&gt;**/u/maxpretzel** My love for music was the overall reason for wanting to contribute to this subreddit. Having the chance to write down reviews of albums and share them with others was really cool and is definitely one of the best things about being a part of /r/albumaday.

&gt;&gt;**/u/oldman78** I happened upon it via a sidebar link in /r/listentous and had to be a part of it. A true music nerd is always telling people what they ought to be listening to anyway

&gt;&gt;**/u/onebluchip**  I've always loved listening to music so when /u/Ravencrush offered me the spot I had to accept.

&gt;#2. What is your favorite album you're reviewed?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ravencrush** Probably the most recent one I've posted. I think I'm constantly improving my writing ability with each review so that they get better and better. Even now when I look at some of the first posts I made and then look at one yesterday

&gt;&gt;**/u/maxpretzel** This is a tough one

&gt;&gt;**/u/oldman78** As in which one of my children do I love the most? I will give a non-answer answer and say that there's no need to pick a favourite because the spirit of this sub is about different music for different moods. Taken as a whole it's like a to do list where every task is rewarding in some way.

&gt;&gt;**/u/**  This is a tough one... probably Discovery by Daft Punk

&gt;#3. What album did you dread to listen to

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ravencrush**  A recently reviewed album by /u/ScaremongerSC. It was [Clipping by Midcity](http://www.reddit.com/r/albumaday/comments/1f8lv0/midcity_by_clipping_an_abrasive_trip_through_the/). The album is combination of hip-hop and harsh noise. I've never been a fan of harsh noise just due to the extreme abrasiveness of it all

&gt;&gt; I initially dismissed it a month or so back before finishing the first song because of the noise elements. I decided to give it another go when Scaremonger reviewed it and I'm glad I did.

&gt;&gt;**/u/maxpretzel** ""Exmilitary"" by Death Grips

&gt;&gt;**/u/oldman78** Nothing I've reviewed here. But I recently sat down and listened to Death Magnetic by Metallica and had to say that despite my deeply diminished expectations it turned out to be worth my time and effort. Not a metal-head

&gt;&gt;**/u/onebluchip** Lon Gisland by Beirut. I only listened to it because /u/Ravencrush told me to. I was convinced I would dislike it but I ended up loving it.

&gt;#4. What album made your ears bleed and made you regret ever listening to it?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ravencrush**  Probably a few albums that never made it to the review process

&gt;&gt;**/u/maxpretzel**  So far

&gt;&gt;**/u/oldman78**  Anything by Skrillex. I've tried repeatedly. There are things I'm just too old for apparently.

&gt;&gt;**/u/onebluchip**  High Tide by Harry Fraud. /r/hiphopheads got me all excited for it but then when I listened to it I was unimpressed.

&gt;#5. How do I

&gt;&gt;**/u/Ravencrush** It's actually pretty simple. There's two main ways someone can begin the process of becoming an approved submitter. One is to submit reviews via the ""Write a Review!"" button in our sidebar which leads you to a form that acts as a template for a normal review on the subreddit. Once you submit it through there

&gt;&gt; The other way is to contact me directly by sending me a message inquiring about posting. I try to respond back as quickly as possible and will probably send you a link to a [template](http://pastebin.com/rBB4uM52) or refer you to our button in the sidebar. I love talking directly with submitters and will never ignore someone on purpose.

&gt;&gt; While you submit reviews for a couple weeks

&gt;&gt; Currently we only have one review a day (hence albumaday)

&gt;&gt;**/u/maxpretzel** By using this link to submit your own album review. You could also read up on other reviews to get inspiration. With the right album

&gt;&gt;**/u/oldman78**  Write a sample review of something you really enjoy

&gt;&gt;**/u/onebluchip**  Its very easy! You click on the ""Write A Review!"" link in the sidebar and fill out the form.

a subreddit for **1 month** with **1506 readers!**

The topic of job hunting is at heart very very boring. No one *really* wants to read about interview etiquette or what socks to wear or what font works best on a CV, and you've eaten all the lint in your pockets, the handshake-firmness-gradient and finding the correct shade of navy interview trousers suddenly take on an incandescent urgency. When you're scrabbling through all the terrible jobs websites with their fake accountancy positions and their suspiciously lucrative modeling opportunities you start to think to yourself ""hey, nxt time I ged an job interview I'm goin do it rite"". 

Great! Now that the layers self-doubt and complacency have been washed away by the rivers of necessity you are ready to absorb the wisdom of /r/GetEmployed. Here you will find 

&gt;Advice

delivered in a way that is engaging and easy to digest. There is a great mix of the employed and the currently seeking as well as those with experience on the other side of the interview table. You will find advice on issues that you might not even have realised were issues at all; should you take the offer with the OK company on Tuesday

At this point I'd like to introduce the **fine moderators** of /r/GetEmployed to tell us about it's strengths (it has no weaknesses)

&gt;##What sort of content can a subscriber expect to see on /r/getemployed?

&gt;&gt; **Avi_:** /r/getemployed is about getting employed! We've got stuff ranging from interview tips, writing resumes and cover letters, and more.

&gt;&gt; **cahaseler:** Job searching and resume building tips, and plenty more. We aim to be a useful starting place for people looking to Get Employed!

&gt;## What is your favourite job-searching tip?

&gt;&gt; **Avi_:** My favorite job searching tip is FOLLOW UP! Too many people drop off a resume or application and sit back waiting for the job to fall in their lap. People forget they need to call back

&gt;&gt; **cahaseler:** For this one
&gt;You're not unemployed

&gt;## What was the best job you ever had

&gt;&gt; **Avi_:** My best job is what I'm doing currently. I am working on a small team of people to plan, but I'm still in school (studying art history) and it's wonderful practical experience. I got it because I know the woman who's in charge of putting it together (one of my professors) and I basically pestered her about letting me help out for an entire semester.

&gt;&gt;  **Apostolate:** The best job I ever had was actually doing nonprofit work that wasn't paid at an organization which worked with service workers and the poor.

&gt;## What is the worst job you ever had

&gt;&gt; **Avi_:** My worst job ever was working at a Chick-Fil-A. I left it because working in front of a fryer at an incredibly busy location for minimum wage without tips is awful. I needed a job badly and that was what was available

&gt;&gt; **Apostolate:** The worst job I ever had was doing door to door fundraising for Environmental causes. Emotionally difficult

&gt;## Anything else you want to say to current or potential subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Avi_:** The more subscribers we have

This is the subreddit where you find all of /u/illustratingreddit 's incredible works of art.  This is the subreddit where the product of dreams and imagination can be found.  This is the home of Sandra Salsbury and it's amazing!!

How many times have you seen or read something on reddit and it's ignited a flame?  Alright, a.k.a. /u/illustratingreddit.  In a nutshell, here's what's up...  

- Girl reads reddit

- Girl creates brilliant watercolour paintings based on these submissions

- Girl becomes reddit mega-celebrity.

For more information

I'm proud to feature /r/illustratingreddit because I am lovin' your work and I can't wait to see what happens next!!  Here to explain all that goes down is the one and only Sandra Salsbury

&gt;From what I got from the Daily Dot interview

&gt;&gt;I wrote a long explanation of how I got into art, unless anyone is interested. Basically, one day I woke up and decided to go to art school. I spent over 7 years there, and ended up focusing on children's books. Since graduating, I've done one picture book and an educational book, as well as smaller projects.

&gt;&gt;I discovered Reddit a couple of years ago, illustratingreddit came about so I would have something to put on a blog. I promptly forgot about my blog the same week I started illustratingreddit.

&gt;&gt;In the beginning, since karma wasn't really my goal. HOWEVER, there was one painting that I spent like 3 hours on and I really liked it, but I got downvoted when I posted it (this was the dragon picture). What really pissed me off is that shitty_watercolour's version had like a million upvotes, but people actually saw mine and thought ""fuck this person. Downvote!"" Now, I want to make it clear that I love shitty_watercolour and he is in no way responsible for other people's opinions of my work. Anyway, I drew a comic about it and another redditor ended up making a post about how I was underrated

&gt;So tell us how reddit fits into your creative process. 

&gt;&gt;So, funny, and very occasionally WTF. The best types of posts for me are 2-3 hours old, on the front page of their subreddit, but not on the reddit front page. Aside from that, I just paint whenever a good, simple illustration comes to mind. I tend to be more inspired by posts about children and animals (you know, and I like posts that are uplifting or funny in an innocent way. My paintings are done in watercolor and they take 1-3 hours to paint and post.

&gt;Why reddit? 

&gt;&gt;Reddit is great because you get exposed to so many different stories. There are just so many directions one can go. And, and it’s actually really helpful to my productivity and ambition to have someone tell me “this painting is awesome.” Also, in general, I find that most redditors are really nice. Sure there are issues with misogyny and those silly threads where someone asks, “what is really popular that you hate?” so that literally THOUSANDS of people can congratulate each other for having the same opinion, but I’ve been a member of much worse communities on the internet.

&gt;So tell us what we have to look forward to.

&gt;&gt;So, and a number of people expressed interest in it becoming a book. My plan was to have a lot more preliminary work done by this time, but I’ve found that I have been very busy recently, so things are just starting to come together now. I am toying with the idea of doing a kickstarter, and hopefully I will have more information about that this month.

&gt;The last paragraph is yours! 

&gt;&gt;I definitely have to thank /u/eonomine, and being acknowledged like that was very beneficial. Also, I really love the other novelty artist accounts. I think people create this imaginary rivalry between artists, but in reality I think we probably enjoy each others’ posts more than your average redditor. I’m hoping that at some point, we can all do a project together.

[/r/Bombing](/r/bombing) is a unique little community on reddit. One that seems to have a culture, bursting with creativity and talent. 

Train cars

Their art? Outlawed.

Their subject matter? Pride and respect.

Their community? Worthy of a SROTD thumbs up. 

The sidebar that the mod team has set up is stocked with graffiti/artist blogs for you to browse

I hope at the very least you can gain a small insight into a cross-section of popular art and alternative media

I always have pictured my brother as being perpetually 11 years old. 

Lanky

But now he's in high-school

We never really connected on any kind of deep emotional level

Though I have never admitted to being a protective personality

He recently rolled his beater of a first car

The mangled sheet metal should have devoured him

I got goosebumps for weeks afterwards when the recurring idea of losing him would slide through my mind.

Hate it when your mind does shit like that. 

He pulls the dumbest stunts sometimes. Always butts heads with my mom. 

Recently

He tried to rationalize why he did it to my parents.

My parents told him that what he did was unacceptable
 
""What did feel like?""

""I felt like the couch""

He willingly participated in answering the litany; I continued probing, and a friend, as a fellow toker and as a human who understands experiences demand an internal and external audience, lest they not be complete. 

But it was after this moment

A person capable of making moral decisions and calculating risk for himself. 

God Help Us. 

He is able to participate in elicit activity and fully understand that what he is doing is against the law.

In a brief conversation with my brother a few weeks after the aforementioned altercation

I asked him what other illegal experiences had he decided sounded like being worth the risk.

He replied

""Holy fuck

Recognizing my confusing

He pulled out a sketch book and flipped through it showing me different variations and designs and styles he has been practicing

Knowing he had a penchant for art

I'd like to think this whole growing up thing will bring me and him together

Thanks as always for joining me.

Good vibes

This community would like like nothing more than a chance to identify your junk.  Not comfortable whipping out your junk, but it gets easier after your first time.  Pretty soon you'll be coming up to strangers in the food court, asking them to check out your goods and there all, ""what the fuck man?!"" And you're all, ""I know right... oh you ladies want to see my stuff too?"" And then you're showin' your junk to all the people in line at Sbarro.  Mall security is asking you to put it away, but you're already showing it to the crowd at TCBY who are about to eat their daily calorie limit in one serving of fro yo.  Fortunately you don't have to go through this... fortunately there's /r/whatisthisthing.

Here to tell us about this great subreddit

&gt;What is what is this thing?

&gt;&gt;A place to find out what that odd-looking thing that you stumbled across actually is. Often the item is old and its function made sense in its time, it's usually the simpler looking objects that are more difficult to figure out. The denizens of /r/whatisthisthing attempt to track down an answer and are exceedingly good at it.

&gt;Let's talk stats. Roughly how many are solved

&gt;&gt;From a quick search

&gt;What's the holy grail of your subreddit - the one that everyone chased or is still chasing.

&gt;&gt;There is one thing that I'm still wondering about. A short while back an item that looks like something created by H.R. Giger was posted with zero hint of what it was with guesses ranging from ""a lamp"" to ""adult toy"". The submitter did answer quite a lot about it and provide a multitude of photos

&gt;What's better

&gt;&gt;Generally speaking, you can get in on the hunt and if you find the answer you get to help someone out.

&gt;Are there any internet-tools your community members make use of (e.g. tineye.com)

&gt;&gt;Offhand I would say it's mostly Google search results pointing people to more specific sites and a good amount of digging. I've been meaning to compile a list of sources for the sidebar but I don't have one at the moment. Can vary from auction sites, etc. It's a odd assortment of sources. Mostly just people using creative ways to combine elements of the thing to get previously unfound results.

&gt;I understand there's a whatisthisbug subreddit and others. Is there a ""whatisthis..."" network?

&gt;&gt;I've thought about it. They're all on the small side and we sometimes get bug/animal/plant posts and people get referred over to the more specific subreddit (but generally get answers here too). These related subreddits tend to have links to one another in their sidebars

&gt;Thanks for joining us today I_Me_Mine!  Any final thoughts?

&gt;&gt;I'd like to point out the solution/filtering system. It uses linkflair and the excellent search mechanism that admin kemitche was quick to update for the purpose. You can see at a glance the status of the various posts. If one is answered but not marked as such, or solved ones if they're curious about what the things are. I think a similar system would be welcomed in most question based reddits, and have brought it over to /r/tipofmytongue thanks to mod RoboBama there.

&gt;&gt;I'd like to thank the creators of redditpics.com

&gt;&gt;Above all

**A community for 9 months with 7

Omnomnomnom. I love food. I never understood how some people just don't care for it. I remember back in my young days when I was in high school, we'd go eat at a restaurant, and before ordering something new off the menu, like anyone else, I'd ask around to see if anybody had the dish before. Some said no, some said yes and gave their opinion. But then there was the debate coach. Mr. Martinez. Anytime anyone asked him a food related question, he'd always reply with ""I would eat dog food if I have to"". I'm not sure if he really meant that or if maybe he didn't have taste buds and this was his funny way of dismissing the topic. Either way

So back to the topic on hand. I love food. But what I hate about food is how expensive it can be. Yes, trying out new recipes. But then there's that little bitch called money. That's where /r/BudgetFood comes in. Here's a community where you can ask questions and share your recipes for cheap meals. I don't want to steal all the thunder, so here is creator [doxsee](http://www.reddit.com/user/doxsee).

&gt;##1. What was the whole idea of starting this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **doxsee:** I wouldn't say I was broke but I needed to cut down on food costs and eating out. Scouring the subreddits I found great communities like r/frugal but nothing dedicated to finding and cooking lower cost food in particular. Times were tough (tougher now for some) and I felt it would be a great place for people of all ages to come and share creative and unique ideas with a common goal of saving money on food.

&gt;##2. What do you hope subscribers of /r/budgetfood can take home with them?

&gt;&gt; **doxsee:** Hopefully they'll bring home bigger bags of groceries...in all seriousness I hope they can achieve a full stomach on a low budget. Also

&gt;##3. Do you and/or your subscribers gear more towards healthy low budget foods or is the community just geared towards any food that is low budget?

&gt;&gt; **doxsee:** A good majority of subscribers align themselves with the healthier aspects of eating on a budget. Early this year I started hosting [Budgetfood Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/posuj/budgetfood_challenge_archive/) 

&gt;##4. What's your favorite low budget thing to eat?

&gt;&gt; **doxsee:** If I had to choose one thing, salt, and one packet of sugar; roast on baking sheet for ~45min)

&gt;##5. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers or any last minute comments you'd like to make?

&gt;&gt; **doxsee:**  I love food. I love making food. My siblings and I all grew up helping my mother cook and bake. It's a passion of mine to this day. In addition I'd like to thank all who subscribe and contribute; you continue to make this a successful subreddit!

Game of Thrones is fast becoming the most talked about TV show this year `[citation needed]`. It's a show that draws people in every week to discuss the latest shocking episode (viewers of the most recent episode

And where better to direct that madness than to the brutally cold subreddit beyond the wall

Subreddit moderator [kjhatch](http://www.reddit.com/user/kjhatch), of course).

&gt; Congratulations. You're the subreddit of the day. Not you
&gt;&gt; Honored

&gt; I think the most important thing people will want to know before joining
&gt;&gt; [/r/gameofthrones](http://reddit.com/r/gameofthrones) is intended to be a spoiler-safe environment. All spoilers should be either covered with our colored tags or pre-warned in a post's title. TV show watchers and book readers who are just getting started can then choose how much they want to know ahead of time. I can't guarantee everything is 100% spoiler-free all the time

&gt; You mentioned that you're pretty much the sole moderator now. Do you have your work cut out for you? How hard is it keeping on top of a subreddit for a show as popular as Game of Thrones?
&gt;&gt; As the subreddit's grown it's definitely gotten a lot harder to keep up. Not everyone takes the time to read the posting policies

&gt; There's just one episode left of the first season
&gt;&gt; Book 5, so I do expect that just as the Season 1 talk starts to die down the new book discussion will take off in a big way. And of course there's already talk of what's coming up in Season 2 of the show.

&gt; Game of Thrones lends itself really well to being able to just go crazy with the subreddit stylesheet and various other customizations. Tell us about your approach to the (awesome) design of the subreddit.
&gt;&gt; When the discussion started about the subreddit design I immediately knew it had to be the Reddit Alien on the Iron Throne. It just fit. I did a few quick mockups for feedback based on the marketing for the TV show to test. They were very well received, shields, and background wall.  
&gt;&gt; The other main CSS customization in [/r/gameofthrones](http://reddit.com/r/gameofthrones) is the use of House tags and sigil icons. Redditors can post to the Choose Your House! thread to join one of the groups named in the series. The names can be anything from a Noble House to an organization like the Night's Watch and appear after redditors' names.

If you’re a fan of Anime or Manga then you probably know or have heard of Anime Music Videos (AMV for short) and if not please do not leave just yet just because you think Anime = Pokémon

So today I'm hear to introduce you to /r/amv, also known as anime. I personally love Anime due to the great stories that they can tell and how they can sometimes be considerably darker than Western cartoons and animations. 

AMV creators love to take some of the most memorable scenes of an Anime series, I watched it and I do feel it earned its place and this is why I love AMVs so much. You might not know the Anime or recognise the song but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the hell out of it. You might even pick up a new song to add to your playlist or a new Anime to spend the weekend on.

Now I don’t think this feature would be complete without a few of my personal favourites that /r/AMV has introduced me to. Number 1 would have to be [Sword Art Online – Our Miracle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIFVjbRXUqs) by iFedeBankai

And now for something you completely expected

&gt;## 1. How did /r/AMV begin?

&gt;&gt; **spazure** I honestly don't know. Someone else started it

&gt;## 2. What is your favourite submission in /r/AMV?

&gt;&gt; **spazure** Oh my gosh, but most people tend to love the very fight-scene action oriented ones.

&gt;## 3. Have you made any AMVs yourself?

&gt;&gt; **spazure** Yes

&gt;## 4. What do you think makes an AMV good?

&gt;&gt; **spazure** Emotion. It's all about finding songs and AMVs that feel like they already belong together

&gt;## 5. Do you like the community’s taste in AMVs?

&gt;&gt; **spazure** Not usually. I comment when I really enjoy something

&gt;## 6. Anything you’d like to add?

&gt;&gt; **spazure** Not much. Um

Also Happy Birthday /u/spazure! 

I'm just going to say please keep replying with AMVs! I love all the ones you guys are commenting with and I want more! Thanks!

Guys, we at /r/SubredditOfTheDay have grown to such a fantastic size that we are passing The Harvey Dent's Law. What is The Harvey Dent's Law you ask?

&gt; You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is that, man. Totally. Not cool. So I want you all to act on your best behavior when you go to /r/PhotoCritique. I want you all to be a shining beacon of awesome.

Anyway

I want to write more about this subreddit but its pretty simple. You post a photograph you took yourself. And other will critique it to help you improve your skill. Thats it. But we as lurkers get to see the apprentice(s) become the master(s) on the sidelines. So thats also a positive. Hey! You never know

~~I'm going to try my best to get the mods to do a SPEED Q &amp; A.~~

&gt;1 How did you end up in /r/photocritique?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Maxion** I noticed the subreddit was a bit inactive, if I could be added.

&gt;2 What has been the best advice you've personally learned from /r/photocritique?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Maxion** I'm going to lump these two together

&gt;3 What post really effected you positively?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Maxion** ---

&gt;4 If you could teach 1 thing to up coming photographers

&gt;&gt; **/u/Maxion** That you don't always get a good photo from every shoot. It's perfectly OK to come home and not have a single good photo. The more experienced you get you learn to avoid those situations where you'll most likely not end up with a good photo. But the skill in going through your own photos and finding those that stand out is really important.

&gt;&gt; Oh, but it's such a useful thing to know how to do properly.

&gt;5 Tell us about the community / Where do you see yourselves (the subreddit) in a few years?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Maxion** This community suffers a bit from features lacking in the reddit platform

You can tell by my name that I love small subs. Those out of the way places that give Reddit its' flavor. One such place is /r/reactionpics. Still frames that perfectly captured my reaction to [finding this sub.](http://i.imgur.com/ZmDI6.jpg) Perhaps it's my temperament.

&gt;&gt; **/u/ViktorStrangle** [I started this sub](http://i.imgur.com/cX5hy.jpg ) as an off-branch of /r/reactiongifs. But more generally I started this after an /r/AskReddit  post about user's favorite reaction pics/gifs.

There you go folks

Because this is my second post I should introduce myself. I'm /u/LoveTheSmallSubs. I recently started this account as a novelty. A way for me to suggest subreddits to posts that had missed their targets. It happens a lot to new redditors just getting their feet wet. Often it's hard to know exactly where to submit a post and why it's getting hammered in the /new queue. That's when I spring into action. Other times it's to recommend a xpost to a sub that may be less known but still have interest in the content. Either way I try to keep it light and informative. Not everyone appreciates my input

Ah yes, no.  I'm getting ahead of myself.  Solar plexus punch, knee to the bridge of my nose, flying roundhouse kick to the jaw, THEN you said, ""this is what failure felt like"".  Truly, there is nothing greater than a mother's love for her son.

We all know that anniversaries are an important note on the keyboard of society, with midgets, on the hard drive of life.  These time-centric celebrations make two people feel awesome simultaneously... the person for whom we are signing the jumbo sized card (with a shirtless firefighter on it), and the person who is doing the signing.   And this is why /r/cakeday is the coolest thing in the house since my sister ""ate"" all the cucumbers.  /r/cakeday gives us a reason to celebrate!  Sometimes the best feeling in the world is not being the celebrated individual,  it's all about making someone's day a little better.  Look, it's quite easy:

1.  Go to /r/cakeday and subscribe by clicking the subscribe button.

2.  When you see a new post

3.  Feel reel good!

So today we feature a wonderful place that exists to bring a little sunshine into people's lives, but what they stand for and will do.  I want to say ""potential"" here, but I've kinda got a negative connection to that word.  Seriously, if one more person tells me I have *potential* I will punch them in the low hanging fruit. 

Here to explain /r/cakeday and accept well deserved compliments is randomdesigner.  Please understand that this beautiful bastard has answered the interview questions instead of studying for finals and writing papers for final grades.  

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;There’s no use lying, I got tired of seeing this mud flung across my pure, beautiful front-page, so I decided to do something about it. I decided to take a stand, to take action. I planned to assemble a militia and track down these neglected, neck-bearded karmawhores and wipe them out once and for all. Bring in the search ‘copters, release the canines, but now silently weeping

&gt;&gt;Instead, something worthy of Its almighty Kingdom of Karma.

&gt;What's the goal? Where we goin' with this?

&gt;&gt;As you can see for yourself, feet, and musical instruments for their one day of carefree upvote-reaping. We offer a relaxed, friendly environment to post something on your cakeday and then disappear into the blinding white depths of reddit for another year. We already have a thriving community of more than 21 members (22 to be exact, if I recall correctly) and you’re more than welcome to hang around r/cakeday for as long as you’d like…however, more than once a year tends to get a bit creepy.

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;So, fret not, dear stranger, for your cakeday is not nearly as big of a deal to the rest of the human population as it is to you (maybe look into wild packs of grizzly bears, though; I hear they love cakedays). Just sit back in your warm, broken in, and distinctly stinky computer chair and relax your tender thighs. Ye needn’t prepare at all. When your cakeday comes, a body part (save the good stuff for r/gonewild)

&gt;How does /r/cakeday make you feel? How come?

&gt;&gt;I’d love to answer this question

*A subreddit for all those who love reptiles and amphibians.*

**962** readers for **2** scaly years.

Hey you, so I wanted to feature one thats not just [silly](/r/banana+pickle) or for [comedic relief.](/r/Zoidberg) Herpetology slowly crawled from the vast sea of sub-par subreddits and has since evolved into a wonderful place.

For those un-informed, I could give this subreddit the proper respect and justice it deserves for an intro. Instead I'm going the easy route and just mentioning how much [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](/r/tmnt) made me love [animals](/r/animalporn ""HONEST TO GOD ITS SAFE FOR WORK."") I once considered, yucky to say the least. 

All joking aside, wouldn't a good majority of present reptiles and amphibians be just dinosaurs that didn't go extinct? We need expert [advice.](http://i.imgur.com/EYpRq.jpg)

&gt;##How did /r/herpetology start? Why did you make it? Background story.
&gt;&gt; Given Reddit's overall ""nopenopeNOPE"" reaction to snakes, so I created it. The initial reception was fairly negative and membership was almost non-existent. It took a lot of shameless subreddit-whoring to get the ball rolling.

&gt;##What is /r/herpetology's mission statement?
&gt;&gt;Officially? We don't have one. It's a place for the scientific discussion of reptiles and amphibians. Although pet care is not the goal, fact-based outlook on amphibians and reptiles, and dispel the lingering superstitions.

&gt;##What has been your favorite post so far?
&gt;&gt;There's absolutely no way I could pick one. 

&gt;##Tell us about your community?
&gt;&gt;The subscribers are very diverse. Some have a Ph.D. or Masters within the science. Some have very little formal education, and some just subscribed for the pictures. It's a very diverse group.

&gt;##Anything you'd like to add?
&gt;&gt;We also do a themed monthly photo contest. All submissions are voted on

#Bonus Interview from a real expert!

&gt;##How did your love for herpetology begin (Background story.)
&gt;&gt;-Dinosaur books as a kid - I had a bunch by the time I was 5 when I decided to be a paleantologist (which I most definitely am not). -Discovered at a very young age that I could find salamanders under logs in the woods. That pretty much sealed the deal for me. -My parents (especially my mother) and grandmother encouraged my interest in wildlife and science

&gt;##Where would you like to see /r/herpetology go towards?
&gt;&gt;We have a lot of pet-keeping posts (which is not really herpetology

&gt;##What has been your favorite post so far?
&gt;&gt;I can't think of one that stands out more than all others but there are a few that I thought were particularly interesting. [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/herpetology/comments/nr24l/performed_a_necropsy_on_a_gravid_snake_today/) showing photos of a necroscopy of a gravid (pregnant) redbelly black snake was interesting and different.

574 Captains of Industry

Hello to all readers

Some redditors who are familiar with a certain subreddit network, when you can look at a serene lake, or a quaint Tibetan villager, or 2 colorful birds of paradise making sweet, sweet love?""

What I think makes IndustrialPorn worthy of attention is that it focuses on the cogs, and vents many of us see every day, but either fail to notice or have learned to ignore. Hundreds or thousands of gears and ingredients, working in tandem like an organism,  seamlessly combined and mixed at the flick of a switch, to produce a modern amenity without skipping a beat. It's a fascinating process, and I for one salute /r/IndustrialPorn for recognizing the monuments to both the creativity and hubris of humanity.

But why listen to me, an delightful bunch who graciously donated some time to talk with us. Details below!

&gt;Please tell us a bit about yourselves.

&gt;&gt;XtortionBear: I'm a 22 year old guy who's currently trying to figure out his life between buying lots of guns and smoking trees.

&gt;&gt;ViewofDelft: I'm a 30 year old dude who occasionally cleans up pollution at work...I think the fumes got to me...so now I enjoy the dystopian aesthetic provided by this sub.

&gt;&gt;jeanlucdickhard: I'm a 24 year old dude, oh how i loved the smell and look of it.

&gt;&gt;defectorlacera: I'm a 25 year old father of two

&gt;What motivated you to mod /r/industrialporn?

&gt;&gt;XtortionBear: I've just always loved industrial things from huge mining machinery to the little flame that spurts out of that one weird factory in a city I live near.

&gt;&gt;ViewofDelft: Got the invite from jeanluc when this sub was very young...haven't looked back.

&gt;&gt;jeanlucdickhard: what motivated me to create it? well

&gt;&gt;defectorlacera: I'm power-hungry. The rush I get being a moderator is akin to the high one gets off toxic waste fumes. I kid

&gt;Why is industrial photography interesting/beautiful to you?

&gt;&gt;XtortionBear: It's so hard to come up with an answer. It's like asking why someone has a particularly deep-seated sexual fetish. Well

&gt;&gt;ViewofDelft: Industrial design is sexy as hell...and I love movies with panoramic industrial scenes...especially sci-fi. Think the views of Los Angeles in Blade Runner. That kind of scene makes me feel both inspired and maybe a little anxious about the future.

&gt;&gt;jeanlucdickhard: it's beautiful because it's so destructive

&gt;&gt;defectorlacera: I believe its the intricacy of the systems that gets me. For instance, all kinds of switches and relays that must work in perfect synchronization to produce a viable product. It is a mechanical symphony.

&gt;What are some of your favourite posts to the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;XtortionBear: All of them. Seriously.

&gt;&gt;ViewofDelft: I like the look of cooling stacks and foundries...molten metal makes my mind melt.

&gt;&gt;jeanlucdickhard: favorite posts? all of them honestly.. a few ive submitted are my favs

&gt;&gt;defectorlacera: The night time shots. The eerie glow just gets me.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of IndustrialPorn?

&gt;&gt;XtortionBear: Thank you **so much** for sticking around and adding to the community. We obviously could not be here without you all contributing and I love you all. Let's help this community grow even more. Together.

&gt;&gt;ViewofDelft: Thanks for lurking...but DO feel free to contribute.

&gt;&gt;jeanlucdickhard: What do i have to say? spread the word... PLEASE POST LOTS MORE 

&gt;&gt;defectorlacera: You'll get out of the subreddit what you put into it. The more you post

It's almost time for the new year

&gt;##What prompted you to start /r/stopsmoking?

&gt;&gt;**&lt;sodypop&gt;** Once upon a time I managed to convince redtaboo to quit smoking while chatting over IM. You can read the [chat transcript](http://pastie.org/private/irtvlkkuiv0v6zotebq) to see how it all began.

&gt;&gt;**&lt;redtaboo&gt;** It's amazing to me to think back on this. One little IM conversation with a random person

&gt;##Has an internet community like reddit been helpful in your attempt to stop smoking?

&gt;&gt;**&lt;redtaboo&gt;** Oh.. boy

&gt;&gt;Once sodypop created his badge system it all snowballed from there. At first every badge was manually entered in the stylesheet then updated daily. While we've outgrown the ability to keep up manually

&gt;&gt;Without those badges I don't know if we'd be where we are today Many, but then I remembered my badge and I don't want to lose that!""

&gt;&gt;**&lt;sodypop&gt;** I had quit smoking about 5 months before the subreddit was created

&gt;&gt;For others, /r/NoFap, /r/GetMotivated, and [many others](http://www.reddit.com/r/makingfriends/faq).

&gt;##Someone reading this smokes. What would you say to them?

&gt;&gt;**&lt;redtaboo&gt;** Honestly

&gt;&gt;**&lt;sodypop&gt;** Nicotine does some weird stuff to your brain. It makes you justify trading your time, but if you want to make a change and need a helping hand then come visit /r/stopsmoking.

&gt;##What would be your advice on getting over the first few days?

&gt;&gt;**&lt;redtaboo&gt;** Stay busy! Stay busy! Stay Busy! Did I mention stay busy? That's really important because if you can get past one craving you can get past the next. &lt;---- so easy to say, keep going and you'll get [there](http://i.imgur.com/TWdSI.png).

&gt;&gt;**&lt;sodypop&gt;** There is no right way to quit smoking. You might fail at first but don't get discouraged

&gt;&gt;It also helps to pamper yourself in the first few days. Get equipped with comfort foods, and anything else that can distract you during the most difficult times. Keep at it until the biggest pain in your ass isn't the cravings, but rather the giant wad of saved cash in your back pocket!

&gt;##What can someone who has never smoked before do to help those who want to stop?

&gt;&gt;**&lt;redtaboo&gt;** Be understanding if they are angry/irritable/snappy and don't take it personally. My third day or so my boss came into my office

&gt;&gt;**&lt;sodypop&gt;** The best thing you can do is to be supportive and non-judgmental. It can also help to plan fun activities that will keep your friend distracted. Things like batting cages

&gt;##What have been the most encouraging stories read in your group?

&gt;&gt;**&lt;redtaboo&gt;** [halbowitz](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/acz2d/you_know_whats_weird_to_me_its_harder_to_think/) has been an inspiration to me from the beginning. He quit the day before we created /r/stopsmoking and I measured my progress against his. [MrSpaceYeti](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/search?q=author%3A%7BMrSpaceYeti%7D&amp;restrict_sr=on) was a huge inspiration to many users as well

&gt;&gt;There are many more. Everyday I am inspired by this community. Where else can you tell a whole community to fuck off and get nothing but love back?

&gt;&gt;**&lt;sodypop&gt;** While the true bread and butter of /r/stopsmoking lies within the friendly and helpful community, month, week, or even just a few days since they quit.

&gt;&gt;As a subreddit, and [badge rage](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/m9zzv/stopsmoking_badge_rage/).

&gt;##Please

&gt;&gt;**&lt;redtaboo&gt;** I am thoroughly addicted to reddit and spend waaaay too much time here. I love this site and it's community Being a part of it has shown me the power of the internet. We really can touch each other

&gt;&gt;**&lt;sodypop&gt;** I am a delicious carbonated concoction with a fizzing addiction to reddit (and lame puns).

There is nothing like the rage that comes from only vaguely remembering one specific thing. Your mind gets stuck on something similar you know isn't it

It could be a book, anything at all. It rests at the tip of your metaphorical tongue, and you're licking all the cold lampposts you can to try and get it off to identify it. Alas, your tongue freezes to the post and everyone laughs at you and throws rocks. That jerk Kevin pegs you right in the ear hole, and there's not a thing you can do about it.

I have always been a DC guy and It all started with Superman.

I have never met ANY person in this world who doesnt know who superman is. I dont think i will ever either and i am pretty sure its the same in your case. Superman is a ""Godly"" superhero. Strong, this hero is one of the most celebrated characters in the human history.

Many people criticize superman for being ""Too powerful"". They are not wrong. As the strongest indestructible being who can be only defeated if subjected to a rock which belongs to his home planet krypton which is not something you would find in your backyard

I have always loved superman. In today's world when everyone wears a mask, the beautiful ideals like compassion, standing up to justice, helping others who are in need, the noble quality of compromise and sacrifice is something which is seldom seen. In these times i believe that we need a ""Icon"", a ""Hero"" who can remind the world of those qualities. Superman may be fictional but he is someone who has the power to be in the mind of a kid whose city has been destroyed by war and still soothe him saying that revenge is not the way.

Superman has always stood and will continue to stand for peace and courage to win. He will always be the earth's greatest defense.

I featured /r/superman today in honour of the new [Superman: Man of steel](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/) movie! I urge each and everyone of you to enjoy it!

And finally here's an awesome interview with the mods!


&gt;##1. How long have you been superman's fan ?
&gt;&gt;**Dorkside:** I can't remember my life without being a Superman fan. He's a character I've been drawn to since I was a small child and I first started to enjoy him by watching re-runs of Super Friends before getting into the comics and discovering the Christopher Reeve movies.  
**relic2279:** My entire life. My father was a collector of comic books, I was infatuated. From then on, I was hooked. Watching Christopher Reeve play Superman in the movies when I was a kid further cemented my fandom.

&gt;##2. whose your favourite superman villain ? why ?
&gt;&gt;**Dorkside:** Lex Luthor. Every great hero needs an iconic villain and Luthor fits that bill more than any other character in the Superman universe. I think what makes Lex such an intriguing adversary is that he has no super powers but instead has to rely on his intelligence and cunning to foil the Man of Steel.  
**relic2279:** I concur with Dorkside. Lex Luthor is iconic. I love the different direction many people have taken with the character. From John Byrne's version to TV's Smallville. Yes


&gt;##3. what makes superman awesome ?
&gt;&gt;**Dorkside:** The super powers! At least that's what first appealed to me as a kid. Now, even though that's often not how the character is portrayed. One of my all-time favourite Superman lines is from Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: ""Superman is what I can do. Clark is who I am.""  
**relic2279:** I actually love the mythos surrounding him. Things about his past, objects &amp; people who survived the planet's destruction, all those things make superman very interesting. When you have an all powerful superhero, you have to get creative to keep him interesting and I think the writers who have taken on the challenge have done a great job of keeping him fresh and relevant through the years.


&gt;##4. do you think superman should be changed in any way ?
&gt;&gt;**Dorkside:** As mentioned above, but to what extent always make for an interesting debate for fanboys and girls.  
**relic2279:** He can be too powerful at times



&gt;##5. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Dorkside:** Let's catch /r/Batman in total subscribers and spread the good word of Krypton's favourite son! Hopefully
**relic2279:** Go out and see the film! If the trailers are any indication

Full disclaimer, redtaboo, and MiraP. Which is where I found my solution, JaxSpider. So simple, so sexy, so me. Now Jax isn't my real name nor anything close to it, but thats another story for another night

I'd like to say, the beginning-middle-end-ish place. You all know Spiderman is a 2nd Gen Super hero right? First Gen (Golden Age) were (and are) the one dimensional characters we come to love like Superman, Flash, and Captain America. The hero(es) the people need to save the them from [Hitler](http://i.imgur.com/GArgw.jpg)'s Nazism, Stalin's Communism and yo momma's Syphilis. So how did Spiderman become what I consider ""the King of the Silver Age (of comics)""? He was a **teenager**, having to deal with the normal struggles of [adolescence](http://i.imgur.com/Lqy8v.jpg) in addition to those of a costumed crimefighter. Back then teenage characters were only shitty sidekicks like Robin &amp; [Bucky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky). Kids never truly related to superheroes before him, In the 60s this was [hardcore.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZpou_C7iDc) This may seem tame today

Personally, I think thats what makes a good hero in general, the villain(s). All good heroes have great villains associated with them. Batman has Joker, X-men have Magneto, Spiderman has Venom, Carnage, The Lizard, Green Goblin

I'm featuring /r/Spiderman because a)we haven't featured it yet

Do you love your hair ? really ? then this is the place to be /r/fancyfollicles is one of the most beautiful subreddits that i have witnessed. I love my hair and I want it to look awesome! Fancy follicles is the sub that makes that happen!

People are so different and so are their hairstyles! Curly, dressing and hair! well i give the top priority to hair but oh well! :D

If you love your hair and want to make it look great check out this sub! The brand line of the sub is ""Hairway to Heaven"" and how true it is :D If you are planning on getting a nice hair style first head to this sub and then get a nice one! Experiment with your hair! Make it look awesome! Enjoy it!

Lets join the nice and solo awesome moderator Teatoly for a nice interview!

&gt;##1. Which is your favourite style ?
&gt;&gt;**Teatoly:** I am particularly fond of the fishtail braid and high bun. I also appreciate tamed curls and vintage styles.

&gt;##2. Do you style your hair ? if yes which is the most frequent style you do ? and your fav color ? care to elaborate ?
&gt;&gt;**Teatoly:** I usually wear my hair down, because I have wavy hair. High humidity means curl definer and a diffuser. Low/no humidity means I can blow-dry it straight and iron it. My favorite color for my own hair is a medium to coppery red. If it were acceptable, I would dye my hair in rainbow colors. I love rainbows!


&gt;##3. Is there some tip you wanna give to newbies who want to style their hair ?
&gt;&gt;**Teatoly:** My best tip is to start with a GOOD haircut. If you have curly hair, no amount of de-frizzing serums can tame abused hair.Also, don't afraid to ask questions. Talk to your stylist, but do your own research.

&gt;##4. do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Teatoly:** To my subscribers, really I want everyone to know that I love how welcoming we are as a community. Seeing non-normative posters and dudes joining in to share their head of hair makes me proud of my community for being so accepting. Thanks for all your support and showing me how much fancy follicles rock!

Sometimes I really hate seeing actors in different roles. Especially when I'm not expecting it and especially when that role is real life.

Take Kiefer Sutherland for example. I can't see him *not* be Jack Bauer. Or Ellen Page. She will always be prego Juno to me.

Speaking of Juno, awkward teenager going after a girl he can't have. Oh wait...

Speaking of Michael Cera, after all, all that I aspire to be in a mother, woman, and social drinker. I'm so glad she's the same in Archer as she was in AD.

My God

So anyway

Unfortunately, it's no one's fault here.

Selecting a subreddit of the day is no exact science.  Back at the Subreddit of the Day Laboratory and Coin-op Laundromat, keep to themselves and spend their 12 hour workdays plugging away at the algorithm that dictates which subreddit we'll feature each day.   Most of the time, it's a homerun while other times it's a line drive to first base double play.

I honestly couldn't tell you what leads them to their selections.  It involves stuff like what's trending on Twitter, again... a very inexact science.  What I can tell you is that today's subreddit was chosen by Maudite alone.  She was forced to work the Laundromat 'cause she ate Magnus' lunch right outta the fridge.  According to Maudite, she was helping a senior citizen wash a load of darks in cold water when he asked if she'd accept getting peed on as a means of repaying her for her kindness.  Maudite was all... Cold water?  Watersports? Cold sports?  Coldplay!  Sometimes they just come to you giftwrapped!  The team was unanimously in agreement on /r/Coldplay, it was brought to the mod team, and the rest is history!! Someone did bring up a good point, that whenever we feature a music group or something as specific as this, it tends to polarize our audience.  You either like the band or not

So, you gotta respect their global appeal...                 
- one of the most downloaded and shared bands on the torrents.                   
- finalist or winner of nearly every well known award including Mercury Prize, etc.               
- they support charities and causes without gettin' too preachy       
- their music and live shows are pretty damn good.

Here to discuss their great community is DundahMifflin

&gt;  Why Coldplay?

&gt;&gt;DundahMifflin:  Coldplay, you hear about them all over the place, but most of it seems to be negative. At least, in the United States. Personally, I find Coldplay to be one of the greatest bands out today.

&gt;&gt;In all the negativity, love or do should be recognized somewhere, and I think /r/Coldplay is proof of that.

&gt;&gt;randorolian:  I think I pretty much grew up with Coldplay thanks to my dad. One of my earliest memories is sitting in the car listening to Trouble with my dad when we were on holiday - I can still remember it perfectly! 2005 was when I really started getting into Coldplay (nowhere near as 'dedicated' to them as I am now though!.) So I've really grown up with them as the kind of soundtrack to my life. In Christmas 2010, Viva la Vida exciting, and you can find a song to match any mood.

&gt;&gt;Redditerminator:  Greetings! Well

&gt;Let's talk about the /r/Coldplay subreddit. What are your goals?

&gt;&gt;DM:  Most importantly, and that was at the very beginning.

&gt;&gt;I'd love to see our subscription count go well past 3, so I think such a goal is possible. We've done a fair amount of promoting, but we have a lot of great stuff coming up that will bring new people in.

&gt;&gt;rand:  I think what I personally would like to achieve with /r/Coldplay is to just help people enjoy company with other people who love Coldplay. Even though Coldplay (in terms of sales) are absolutely massive

&gt;&gt;RT:  I mainly intend to put all my efforts into providing a corner on reddit were Coldplay fans can gather and share their love of this awesome band.

&gt;Give us three interesting facts about the band that we might be surprised to learn.

&gt;&gt;DM:  I. Will Champion, Guy Berryman and Jonny Buckland were having auditions for a drummer when in college around 1996, Chris' roommate - who was initially going to tryout - ended up missing. Because of that, Will got to audition and became the drummer. (Thank God!)  II. The song ""Green Eyes"" off A Rush of Blood to the Head is not about a girl or past love, but about Jonny Buckland, the guitarist. They've been friends since college, and it shows on-stage.  III. Chris Martins' great

&gt;&gt;rand:  I) Guy Berryman (the bands bassist) is the only member without a college qualification, him and his band would have a clutch of awards and a bestselling album on both sides of the Atlantic!
II) Despite many of Coldplay's most well known songs being incredibly popular (Speed Of Sound, Yellow, Shiver), they have only ever had two number one singles in the United Kingdom, Viva la Vida in 2008 and Paradise in January 2012.
III) One of Coldplay's earliest ever songs is named 'Ode to Deodorant'

&gt;&gt;RT:  Chris Martin is a longtime friend of actor Simon Pegg. U2 has been important influence on Chris Martin musically and politically. Coldplay has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, think of the last one as a bonus.

&gt;Featuring a subreddit based on a single band or performer is tough. You're either with 'em or not &amp; rarely are people on the fence these days. What would you say to those who feel like Coldplay isn't their cup of tea and may not enjoy today's Subreddit of the Day?

&gt;&gt;DM:  The beauty of music is that there are literally thousands of different bands and tons of genres for someone to get into. If you don't like Coldplay
That said

&gt;&gt;rand:  I'm not sure if there's really much to say - everyone's different and if you don't enjoy a band, give them a chance before you judge Coldplay on a few songs you've heard. I'd say a lot of their best songs aren't released as singles, and people should have a listen to the full albums.

&gt;&gt;RT:  To each it's own

&gt;Final paragraph belongs to you.

&gt;&gt;DM:  A big, to the moderators, to the hilarious comments we get, I absolutely love it. We have an awesome future ahead of us, and it will only get better from here.

&gt;&gt;rand:  I'd just say that even if you're a 'casual fan', and I really believe the only way it can go is up :)

&gt;&gt;RT:  Thank you very much for your support and thank you for featuring r/Coldplay as the subreddit of the day.

Thanks very much!  In conclusion

My name is Sing Xiaolong. I'm an ordinary wheat farmer in eastern China. I work the rich fertile fields. Its a tough but rewarding job. My bare hands maybe rough but my smile is constant. I have a little hut I call home and I make enough money to keep my family feed and have good medicine from the big city for my aging mother. Living a simple yet peaceful life in my tight nit village. Its lovely when its quiet....

**Scene two** - *The dilemma*

As I'm walking home from another hard day's work just a week or so before harvest season. I notice massive smoke coming from the village's direction. It seems strange since that much smoke only happens when we hold a festival... or... (let it just be a nightmare) bandits! I rush back to the village fearing the worst and praying for the best. Mumbling prayers to whatever god will hear me

**Scene three** - *The bad guy*

As I race to get only meters away from the village gate, my family, my everything is now just a firestorm of burning rumble. As I stare into the abyss of destruction, lost in its undiscriminating destructive properties, A silhouette figure jumps out of the wall of flames. Its of a huge man with muscles on top of muscles wearing cheap armor while riding his black as night steed. Many times before in my life I've meet strong men but today was my first encounter with the harbinger of death, himself. He didn't feel the same way about me though, he looked straight into my eyes

Here is the Q&amp;A with the one man content posting machine himself

&gt;##I. How did you get into Kung Fu movies? Background story?

&gt;&gt; I got into Kung Fu movies when I was young

&gt;##II. Your Top 3 Kung Fu movies of all time.

&gt;&gt; My top 3 favourite kung fu films would be: [Eight Diagram Pole Fighter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfAUY9ZQVL0)

&gt;##III. What makes Kung Fu movies special or different?

&gt;&gt;  Most kung fu movies have the same sort of formula. Master/school/temple/family is disrespected so student/brother/friend has to get revenge on the rival school/general/emperor and usually includes awesome training sequences. Another unique quality of kung fu films are the sets. They're usually lavishly decorated

&gt;##IV. Whats your thoughts on Bruce Lee

&gt;&gt; I love when films by martial arts stars come to North America. Most of my friends got into kung fu movies due to seeing a few Jackie Chan

&gt;##V. Whats the weirdest Kung Fu movie you've ever seen?

&gt;&gt; I would say the weirdest kung fu film is [Mr Vampire.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiGkCtTEQI) It's not strictly a martial arts films. It's a mix of comedy

&gt;##VI. Do you think Kung Fu movies will forever have a place in our hearts or is it something cherished from the past?

&gt;&gt; For me kung fu films are mostly a nostalgia thing and I will always love them. I really like the classics more than ones made in the past 10 years, less and less martial arts movies are being made and I think eventually die out like blaxploitation and other exploitation movies.

&gt;##VII. Anything else you'd liked to finish with?

&gt;&gt; Kung fu movies have their own type of charm to them. They're quite unique in the fact that they're all similar (if that makes any sense). The sets, the sound effects, the music. Take away any of those from a kung fu film and it just won't feel the same.",,False,self,t5_2sgno,,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/qllj2/march_7_2012_rkungfucinema_everybody_was_kung_fu/

Alright, but since we just hit ten-thousand I feel that now's as good a time as any.  Here's how it goes down.  Each morning it all happens with a pen, paper, a bus ride and the Oracle.  Exactly Who the Oracle is *changes* each day.  Often it's the heavy-set woman of colour with the big bosom, it may be the elderly Asian man in denim pants who always has his hands behind his back, (standing or sitting!), or it may be the mustacioed bus driver with polyester uniform, I pay my fare

I've only got the length of my bus ride OR the length of their trip to extract the information so I've learned that speed is key. I jockey up to the divine individual and dance begins!  The conversations I have are irrelevant to the untrained

Today's Oracle, greasy hair and [inexpensive eyewear.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVcyNANK5cY)  Spotting him was easy.  He was seated at the back with no one around, not even his conscience.  As I approached him he never broke eye contact, rhythmically patting the seat beside him, gesturing for me to join him.  I clenched my pen and quickly sat to his right.   Immediately, without regard for anyone around him he lay his head on my lap and closed his eyes.  I sat motionless.  Then came the hands, and the gutteral moans (bus folk always have gutteral moans!)  He started rubbing my thighs like he needed to warn the other crickets of imminent danger.  And then I heard it!  Somewhere in mid rub he said the magic words, that's how we choose the Subreddit of the Day!

&gt;&gt;Some of the mods from another subreddit found this one languishing empty and decided that we might be able to build a community that cares about the posters. We wanted a subreddit where abuse isn't tolerated...by the time someone is posting here they are usually upset enough and that is the last thing they need.

&gt;I'd like to know how you see this subreddit. Tell us what purpose(s) you serve.

&gt;&gt;We see our community as a safe place people can ask for unbiased, we ask a lot of our community. We require posters to formulate informative questions and we ask our responders to refrain from abuse and keep things on topic. This is especially important when talking about relationships, as controversial issues are bound to arise. We feel that the absence of the typical no-holds-barred approach to Internet discussions allows for more nuanced conversation, and that allows all sides of an issue to be explored. Any problem to do with your friends, family or significant others has a place here and because of our international community, there will always be someone here to answer it any time of the day.

&gt;Your subreddit has the most comments-per-post I've seen in a while. Explain this for us... tell us about your extremely helpful community.

&gt;&gt;For one thing, no funny cat pictures, no recycled links reposted for the nth time. This means everything you see is original content, worth responding to.

&gt;&gt;Furthermore

&gt;What's this now!? Expansion of the /r/relationships family? What

&gt;&gt;We found that “relationships” casts a rather wide net: finding someone, ending relationships, recovering from breakups. Unfortunately, requiring all of posts to be strictly questions about a specific relationships, while making for good discussion, also excludes a lot of useful relationship related material.

&gt;&gt;That’s where our other subreddits come in. Dating advice, but are still a great help to people looking for more general advice. Each part of the community has a place within the whole; localized centers exist within the main page to make smaller communities without isolating them from the larger sphere. In this way, we specialize. Throw in a little CSS magic, and we have a whole family of related subreddits for our readers to enjoy.

&gt;&gt;For your reference

&gt;&gt;[/r/Breakups](/r/breakups): A place for all questions regarding the one who got away or the one you got away from.

&gt;&gt;[/r/Dating_advice](/r/dating_advice): For the early stages of meeting a special someone and the trials and tribulations of the dating world.

&gt;&gt;[/r/Ihaveissues](/r/ihaveissues): A community for long-standing problems that impact your interpersonal relationships.

&gt;&gt;[/r/Relationship_tips](/r/relationship_tips): A place to share success stories

&gt;&gt;And

&gt;&gt;/r/SettleThis: We had a series of posts earlier this year where the OP’s posted both sides of their story and linked to each other’s posts. These posts drew some of the highest response we had ever seen

&gt;Three things I like about /r/relationships are...

&gt;&gt;The multi-page: Some days you just want to talk about breakups and getting through the bad times, without visiting five different subreddits.

&gt;&gt;Teachable moments: As posters

&gt;&gt;The spirit and quality of discussion of the community: For the most part

&gt;One thing I'd like to change is...

You've read novels in school.  Ever think about how it's done?  What kind of task it would be to write such a long story?  How would it feel to actually do it?  Here's our chance to find out.

Admit it.  You've had great ideas for stories.  Also some not so great ones.  That's okay.  You still have ideas

National Novel Writing Month is a time of year when the quality of writing decreases.  Seriously.  It's meant to not be so good.  Instead of writing ""good"", if you want to construct your own).

At the time of preparing this


&gt;##Why should someone take part in NaNoWriMo?

&gt;&gt;**PETRAPTOR**:  A lot of people talk about wanting to write a novel. They talk about the great ideas they have. They talk about the fantastic characters they've created. They talk and talk and talk

&gt;&gt;**AGLET**: It requires discipline while fostering creativity. I can't say you need to write every day (I didn't last year, you don't have time to get wrapped up in over-analyzing and self-editing. As an over-analytic self-editor, I found this very freeing; I tapped into parts of my creativity that have been accessed only rarely before.

&gt;&gt;**KILLERWHALETANK**: NaNoWriMo is a writing experience unlike any other. For those who enjoy writing, and do it in a semi-competitive setting. I first took part in 2003, and through the uses of the forums and write-ups and general meet-ups, I found it easier to get those words down on paper than I would have if I just sat down and wrote on my own.

&gt;&gt;**BEEDLE3**: Nano is a great kick in the butt for those who have those bursts of creativity and think ""wow, and to commit and really give yourself the freedom to create.

 

&gt;##What inspired you to write a novel initially?

&gt;&gt;**PETRAPTOR**: A high school teacher encouraged us to try Nanowrimo. I didn't actually start attempting it until college.

&gt;&gt;**AGLET**: I've always loved writing on my own
Last year there was a lot of upheaval in my life after several extremely challenging and exhausting years. In the process
Joining NaNo was symbolic to me in ways greater than writing a novel. For the first time in years

&gt;&gt;**KILLERWHALETANK**: Truth? I was in fourth grade when my teacher asked us all to rewrite Pinocchio. Most of the kids in the class came up with a page or so double-spaced

&gt;&gt;**BEEDLE3**: I've been writing since I was little

 

&gt;##Do you do any other writing

&gt;&gt;**PETRAPTOR**:  I do occasional writing outside of Nano. I have a few published articles on various topics in small, is academic.

&gt;&gt;**AGLET**: I'm a self-employed writer now

&gt;&gt;**KILLERWHALETANK**: I do, it's kind of hard for me to finish an idea. I also have a personal blog that I update every couple of days.

&gt;&gt;**BEEDLE3**: I write and edit screenplays

 

&gt;##What tips would you give for someone to finish their goal?

&gt;&gt;**PETRAPTOR**: Plan ahead. Plan out how your novel is going to end in advance. Even if you scoff at the people who have a 10

&gt;&gt;**AGLET**:  Just keep at it, walk away for a bit. When she is, sweep her off her feet and put everything else in the corner.  1667 words sounds like a lot, but it's very doable if broken into smaller chunks throughout the day.
And

&gt;&gt;**KILLERWHALETANK**: Write. Just write. Don't worry about spelling, and it's always easier to go back and fix everything once it's all written.

&gt;&gt;**BEEDLE3**: If you write every day in November


 

&gt;##If you didn't reach the goal you set

&gt;&gt;**PETRAPTOR** Last year

&gt;&gt;**AGLET**:  My goal last year was just to finish

&gt;&gt;**KILLERWHALETANK**: I actually finished last year

&gt;&gt;**BEEDLE3**: I've participated in Nanowrimo 8 times, so I'm anticipating having much more time to devote to Nano. That being said, if you're not the world's biggest procrastinator, it's still very possible to do Nano while in school.


 

&gt;##How can reddit offer support for NaNoWriMo participants?

&gt;&gt;**PETRAPTOR**: Reddit already offers support. With all the interesting tidbits of information and peeks into people's lives

&gt;&gt;**AGLET**: I loved the daily word counts folk posted last year. There was always someone who was like ""Daily word count... 170. I suck."" and someone else who was all ""4078 today!"" It was a great mix.
It'd be fun to have a thread going as a real-time write in... for those of us willing to risk being near reddit.

&gt;&gt;**KILLERWHALETANK**: Support! Lively discussions with anyone who finds themselves knee-deep in writers' block. Writers can post here and share ideas

&gt;&gt;**BEEDLE3**: Currently Nano has a forum and twitter. The forum is full of regional meet ups, etc, but can be a bit much to trudge through when you're trying to get your word count for the day in. The Nano twitter stream is great because they lead word sprints (which I find especially motivating). I think reddit's participation in Nano should focus on the best, most relevant websites, easiest Nano word count reward recipes and anything else you could think of. Mostly I'd just be excited to see some more movement around here.

Sometimes I like to open the dishwasher 1/2 way through the cycle &amp; let the mix of steam &amp; toxic dish detergent hit me square in the face.

Sometimes I flush mid pee.

Sometimes I purposely forget to tell the cashier when a mistake has been made in my favour.

Sometimes I catch myself singing the chorus to [""Moves Like Jagger""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEPTlhBmwRg&amp;t=1m44s).

But of all the things that I do, maybe it was all that aluminum cookware, or Mom's famous sour cream and onion paint-chips.  It's useless.  Neither I nor anyone from the medical community can figure out why I like puns!  I've tried acupuncture (acupuncture? all I wanted to do was dance with 'er!), pediatricians (...they have such little patients), podiatrists (...my new arch enemies), a urologist (who told me ""urethra like puns or you don't!""), an optometrist (who was always cutting corneas), ""puns, (he said there was nothing oedipal.)  Apparently there are only 2 doctors who can tell me why I love puns

Here to explain /r/punny is my good friend *darmog*

Sadly, it's here!!

&gt;Please tell us what we'll find at /r/punny.

&gt;&gt;at /r/punny, you'll be brought to a pun which is good for a laugh, or at least a groan, but most comments further the pun in further and unexpected ways. You never know what twist to expect. It keeps things interesting.

&gt;Only 5 months? How did you start this subreddit and what's your history been like?

&gt;&gt;Indeed, and named it ""punny"" as a takeoff of /r/funny, but specifically geared to puns. I started it off by sharing a few of my favorite puns and the readers have taken it from there with a seemingly endless variety of puns.

&gt;Please differentiate

&gt;&gt;Puns, or words that sound the same, to make the joke. It's really a specific subset of jokes. For example, blond jokes, they would belong in /r/funny. What belongs in /r/punny are jokes like... ""My father came from eastern Europe."" ""Russian?"" ""No, he took his time.""

&gt;Please discuss the ""lowest form of humour"" label that puns receive.

&gt;&gt;I'm probably biased here. Some believe that puns are the lowest form of wit, but it takes more effort to make a joke that specifically exploits meanings of words, or a similar sounding word. Perhaps one of the reasons why some people have such a low opinion of puns is that it's one of the forms of humor that are as likely to draw a groan as a laugh! Consider: ""What do you get when you toss a hand grenade into a kitchen in France? Linoleum blownapart."" See what I mean?

&gt;What's your personal favourite type of posts? Got a fave pun these days?

&gt;&gt;I would have to say that my favorites are the ones that are especially clever or involve multiple puns. One of my favorites? Mahatma Gandhi walked barefoot everywhere

&gt;&gt;Even when he was not on a hunger strike, he came to be known as a . . .

Getting through life is difficult. You've got your basic needs, or just when we're feeling lazy. Clever shortcuts are the secret to life, saving time, money, and effort usually all at the same time. What a genius idea it is to put a fork through the middle of an Oreo (long-ways, mind you) to dip it in your milk.

/r/LifeProTips brings us all these wonderfully clever ideas that we just didn't think of before. They're usually so simple it's silly

&gt;How did r/nsfw_gif start?
&gt;&gt;I made this subreddit a little over a year ago to basically store my favorite GIFs.  Half of the time my links get ghosted on r/nsfw so it was just a cool way for me to bookmark. Then we started to grow a bit so I gave Darkmannx (reddit's runner up porn king) mod status and he linked us to some of his subreddits.

&gt;Do you provide ""sauce"" to the NSFW gifs? Very important question.
&gt;&gt;Sauce is delivered probably 75% of the time. Usually if OP doesn't add it

&gt;Does JJ.am / 4gif.com get a pay check? Or is it direct deposit?
&gt;&gt;The only deposit they get is in semen format.

&gt;What is one NSFW gif you wish you could find the ""sauce"" / source for?

Even though there isn't much that they doth

There are so many different species

Some even eat people feces!

They spend their days in treetops serene

living a life often unseen

Sleeping,

All done in the eaves of the trees

___

Their carefree days

cure my malaise

Their zen style

always makes me smile

I think we should all strive

to have a little sloth in our lives

Awwwww yissss! (That's awwww yeaaaah for those who don't speak Australian).  2012 is here so let's visit the ol' resolution list...

1.  Start eating healthy by keeping the celery stick that comes with the hotwings!

2.  Stop rewarding myself with food.  McDonald's gift certificates are just as good.

3.  Exercise more

4.  Finally lose the 8 pounds I gained when our second child was born.  *Oooh he was delicious!*

The time is now my friends!  You've postponed, your lame ass reasoning and just do it!  It's time to Lose.  The.  Fat!  (Thanks for shouting that like we were on an infomercial).

What's that?  You can't do it because you don't feel like a strong enough connection has been made between you and someone important in your life that will make your commitment to weight loss a reality?  Seriously?   Am I hearing this right?  Well here's 48, you got e-friends who have no time for real family but are there when you (or any other complete stranger) need them.  Who will help you achieve your weight loss goals?  Fellow redditors will help you achieve your weight loss goals.

Ah yes.  /r/loseit.  For about a year now, here's the thing.  This could be your typical ""Post-and-comment"" subreddit (like our crappy sub), but no.  These mods and members understand that losing weight is hella difficult, so they made it a fun place.  There's challenges, motivational photos of redditors losing weight, they even have a hall of fame!  Let's just say that this place is everything a good subreddit can and should be.  So, it's fun but as we know, helpful comments, you are dead to me!

Here for a brief interview is xtc46.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;An FAQ full of information regarding healthy weightloss and a community with people who are trying to achieve the same thing (or have already achieved the same thing) you are trying to achieve. It is generally a very supportive community that answers questions

&gt;You have so much going on... stuff at the top of your subreddit

&gt;&gt;I don't handle any of the challenges

&gt;What's it like modding for /r/loseit? What are your responsibilities?

&gt;&gt;It is busy. It is a highly active community and one that focusing on a topic that is incredibly popular, and generally bad information at times. As mods, we need to help cut back the noise so real information can be propagated and negativity and bad information arent. The community as a whole is pretty good at this most of the time, so mostly we are just spamfilters, but we do try to guide the community in a way that allows the efficient transfer of knowledge between subscribers.

&gt;What is your favourite part of being a moderator at /r/loseit? What would you like to change as a mod?

&gt;&gt;Getting rid of bad information. I made a lot of mistakes when I tried to lose weight, and as a mod I am in a better position to get rid of the noise in the weight loss community as it is rarely helpful to people trying to make an actual change. Bad information wastes time and can be unhealthy - so Id like to do what I can to stop that.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt; Proper diet, 1 month, or 1 year diet. It is a change in lifestyle that allows you to then maintain your new weight. Most people didn't get fat in a month and they shouldnt expect to get thin in a month.

&gt;Your turn

&gt;&gt;There are no shortcuts. Read the FAQ in /r/loseit and /r/fitness and make educated decisions. If something seems like it is too good to be true, and then achieve them.

10.  /r/StopDrinking.  ""a place for redditors to motivate each other to control or stop drinking.""

What does /r/stopdrinking have to do with quality and/or quantity?   The point is this, go to the comments and witness humanity at its best.  Incredible support, honesty, people helping people.

Here to present /r/StopDrinking is Franks2000inchTV

&gt;Full disclosure

&gt;&gt;I have no idea to be honest! From a subreddit perspective I try to be helpful and friendly to everyone who posts. I work extra-hard to make sure that people are free to talk about whatever is working for them

&gt;This is a fantastic subreddit. In your words

&gt;&gt;[/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking) is a subreddit where redditors help other redditors stop or control their drinking. basically it's a bunch of people going through the same thing

&gt;&gt;[/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking) is method-agnostic. That is to say we are not affiliated with AA or any other particular recovery method. People are free to share whatever strategies are working for them and to give support and advice from their particular perspective no matter where they are in their recovery process.

&gt;Talk about your community members. Are commenters usually submitters &amp; vice versa?

&gt;&gt;Our community is about 325 strong now and includes people in all stages of recovery. We have new people quitting drinking every day and people who have been sober for 10 years. It's a pretty active community with lots of discussion and it's been great to see some truly supportive relationships develop.

&gt;I'm not sure of the poster/lurker ratio, and having them pop up on my frontpage every day helped a great deal. If there are lurkers on /r/stopdrinking I hope its providing the same value.

&gt;&gt;Most of our posts are self-posts, and some posts are just about how that person feels that day. They're all opportunities for sharing and learning how to live alcohol-free. No questions are off limits, and because our group is so diverse there's a lot of variety in the strategies that are shared.

&gt;Your site has the best use of flair I've seen yet. Who's taking care of this and how does it work?

&gt;&gt;The flair is the brilliant work of [sodypop](http://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop), and to maintain accountability. It's often easy to let yourself slip, but when slipping involves telling the whole community that you slipped, then it's a lot easier to stay on the straight and narrow.

&gt;&gt;Requesting a badge means making a public statement that you have decided to change your life for the better. And it gives you something to hope for in the early days when the real positive life changes haven't kicked in yet.

&gt;&gt;For a lot of problem drinkers the idea of never drinking again is overwhelming. The badges give you something in the short term to concentrate on

&gt;&gt;As far as how it works: It's a script that scrapes a google calendar and adds/updates the badges automatically! I just create an all day event on the person's quit date in the calendar with their username as the title and the script does the rest!

&gt;&gt;sodypop's badge system is terrific

&gt;Some redditors may want to stop drinking

&gt;&gt;If you are thinking about quitting drinking you should subscribe to /r/stopdrinking and join the conversation! That's the first thing. A lot of people who are problem drinkers feel trapped like there's no way to escape and like they are alone with their problem. Talking to people is a great way to understand that there is a better life out there and you can have it!

&gt;&gt;Even if you're not ready to quit just yet, then there's a bunch of people who can offer advice and support in that process.

&gt;&gt;Also: unsubscribe from all of your alcohol-related subreddits. I know there's a lot of people who come to /r/stopdrinking from /r/cripplingalcoholism. If you're someone who thinks you drinking might be a problem

&gt;&gt;At the very least, and whether this is the right time for you or not. If /r/stopdrinking isn't your thing there are lots of other recovery groups on reddit like /r/aarecovery and /r/AlAnon. Find one that works for you.

&gt;&gt;Aside from the subreddit

&gt;Let's put this bar mitzvah on hold and give you the mic. What words do you have for us Uncle Frank?

&gt;&gt;I think the last thing to say is thanks to all the members of [/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking) who have created such a wonderful and supportive community in such a short time. Fundamentally

Now ontology and myself are partners in crime, approving (and, if necessary) rejecting the posts that come our way.

&gt;&gt;As for the paycheque, recent grad with a ridiculous love for the internet. No money in that...

&gt;And now for the tough journalism... only rage comics? Come on!

&gt;&gt;Yes

&gt;Please tell us about the book!!

&gt;&gt;The book would be best explained by someone who has more knowledge about the book. I might be a mod, but knows how to chop Paltrow's head off, so he can't be all bad.

&gt;Share with us all (a) how many recipes you try out

&gt;&gt;I love to cook (and pretty good at it, ideas, and inspiration, but I have difficulty following them to the letter. Rage recipes are great for quick tips and unique twists, and it's not very often I cook and don't have my beloved /r/f7u12d nearby.

&gt;Anything on the horizon?

&gt;&gt;It all depends on what the people of the internet want. I'm always listening!

POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY:  I'M NEW HERE, AND VERDAMMT ARE AWESOME! I THINK THIS SUB IS BY FAR THE BEST RAGE-RELATED REDDIT, ALTHOUGH I WORKED AT A GRILL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME, SO I MIGHT BE PREJUDICED, LOL!

I'LL JUST WEIGH IN ON THE ""ONLY RAGE COMICS"" QUESTION: OF COURSE ONLY RAGE COMICS! IT'S NICE TO FORCE FOLKS TO MAKE A SIMPLE RECIPE UNDERSTANDABLE IN JUST A FEW FRAMES SUCH THAT ANYONE CAN TRY IT OUT.

*A cowboy was taken prisoner by a bunch of Indians. The Indians were all prepared to kill him when the chief announced that due to the celebration of the Great Spirit

*""I wanna talk to mah horse!"" says the cowboy. He goes over to his horse and whispers in its ear. The horse neighs, the horse comes back with a naked lady on its back. Well, the Indians are very impressed, so they let the cowboy use one of their teepees. A little while later, the cowboy stumbles out of the teepee, tucking in his shirt. ""What do you want for your second wish?"" says the chief.*

*""I wanna talk to mah horse!"" says the cowboy. Again, and takes off at full speed. About an hour later, the horse comes back with another naked lady on its back. Well, the Indians are very impressed indeed. So, once again, they let the cowboy use one of their teepees. The cowboy stumbles out a little while later, and the chief asks the cowboy ""What do you want for your last wish?""*

*""I wanna talk to mah horse!"" says the exhausted cowboy. This time he grabs the horse by the ears and yells

We are living in interesting and exciting times.  How cool is it that if there's something around you that needs a-fixin' or constructed, if you have a repair problem, someone else probably had the same bad luck, fixed it and posted it on youtube.  But more importantly, if there's something you want to make, someone has made an educational video for that too!  [Stupid Daft Punk helmet.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0TBZeCgL0E)

Which brings us to today's feature, post something. But what makes this subreddit work is the tremendous community.  It's a very large group and they're incredibly supportive and encouraging.  Don't believe me?  Take 5 minutes to go through the comment section of any given posting.  So much love here... I'm so ashamed to say that I never knew about this sub until now.  I've missed out on so much!!  

I hope today's Subreddit of the Day brings you years of enjoyment and a place to submit your very own creations.  Here to discuss /r/SomethingIMade is the creator

&gt;Please explain your subreddit

&gt;&gt;/r/somethingimade is a place to showcase anything and everything you (or a non-redditor very close to you) have made. We've had some pretty awesome submissions. Anything from [Monster Furniture](http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/as4ii/toothy_the_little_monster_end_table_was_just/) to a [Chainmail Shirt](http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/iwki0/finished_my_chainmail_shirt_made_from_around_six/) can be found.

&gt;&gt;We're a little different from /r/DIY in that we don't focus on the creation process as much as the final product

&gt;How did this begin?

&gt;&gt;Well

&gt;&gt;Seriously though

&gt;Take a moment to tell us about yourself. What have you made?

&gt;&gt;I'm an Electrical Design Engineer who just graduated from MIT this past June

- [a device that reverses entropy](http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/hlc55/my_friends_and_i_made_a_device_that_reverses/)

- [a clock](http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/9bat9/heres_a_nixie_tube_clock_that_i_made/)

- [a bullet counter](http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/ervnz/for_christmas_i_made_my_uncle_a_bullet_counter/) (Yes

&gt;&gt;Among other things.

&gt;You must have favourites - what have you seen lately that's blown your brain? How many people post pictures of their kids?

&gt;&gt;Lately

&gt;&gt;As far as photos of kids, it's always upvoted because the person holding said object is attractive. We're a little more pure (or perhaps universally hideous…).

&gt;Tell us about the community. Why'd you put the Etiquette sign up ch00fer?

&gt;&gt;That's **MR.** ch00fer to you!

&gt;&gt;The community has been great so far. Even though we've grown three fold over the past few months

&gt;&gt;Putting something you made yourself on the internet is like putting yourself on the internet for everyone to judge and criticize. It's hard sometimes to not take negative comments seriously. We certainly don't want to scare anyone away though

&gt;Your subreddit is growing like a weed - what's the future hold?

&gt;&gt;I was really surprised with how big it's gotten recently. So surprised that [I made a post about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/j0rm1/what_the_heck_happened_to_rsomethingimade_on_the/). I love that /r/somethingimade is getting more mainstream

I am SO HAPPY to get the chance to feature this sub. Action Figures are basically toys moulded in our favourite characters which children and adults(atleast me :D) like playing with. I confess that i dont have a good memory. I dont remember my test marks which were given 2 weeks back. So my childhood memories are very hazy. But if there is one thing that i remember is playing with action figures with my favourite cousin :) The best thing was when even after 15 years me and my cousin played with them for atleast an hour some days back :D

Action figures are awesome. My prized collection included [Batman](http://www.hollywood-diecast.com/my%20batman%20figures.JPG), [Big Show](http://www.wrestlingshop.co.uk/images/P/300x-big-show-series-1.jpg) from WWE, [He-Man](http://www.mwctoys.com/images/review_motuc1_1.jpg), [Iron-Man](http://www.coolest-toys.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ironman_toy_group.jpg), [Spiderman](http://www.tmnttoys.com/reviews/MarvelLegends/spiderman/6594.jpg), [Superman](http://www.poeghostal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/superman-4.jpg) and more. All these filled a big box made of cardboard with over a 700 figures! These figures tested my imagination skills. To think all these characters in the same dimension fighting against each other can be made only in our minds. We played with them constantly till late nights making our own story lines, teams and real life sound effects :D  
If you are ever gonna give a gift to some child, stretches the imagination of the child and brings the precious smile which everyone wants in their child. 

Action figures have come a long way. They have become sophisticated

Here is an awesome interview with the mods!


&gt;##1. what motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**Custodian_of_Oa:** I created this sub on a whim because the name wasn't taken. I was subscribed to another toy related sub that wasn't very mod active and at some point Toys_and_bacon asked me if I wanted to get this sub up and running as an alternative.  
**Toys_and_Bacon:** I'm just an enthusiast
**airbrushedvan:** I put myself in as a possible mod when this cool subreddit was looking and they picked me

&gt;##2. which was your first action figure that you remember ?
&gt;&gt;**Custodian_of_Oa:** My oldest action figure memory is being surprised with a whole bunch of Ninja Turtles action figures brand new in the box under the Christmas tree. We were pretty poor growing up but somehow my mom always managed to give me everything I ever wanted.  
**Toys_and_Bacon:** Masters of the Universe He-Man and Skeletor two-pack. Christmas gift.  
**airbrushedvan:** My first figure was probably a Peter Venkman figure from the Real Ghostbusters Cartoon.

&gt;##3. Have you had battles with your favourite figures ? and is there some favourite games which you play with them ?
&gt;&gt;**Custodian_of_Oa:** I don't actually play with them much. Most of them are still in the box.  
**Toys_and_Bacon:** Oh yes, it's more about displaying them, sorting the collection, than it is to actively play with them. But where is the line drawn for what can be called ""play""? I say if we own toys, then it can be considered playing, regardless if we display them unopened, or if we clash them together and make explosion sounds.  
**airbrushedvan:** I like to do large setups on my shelves of various figures. I have Kirk vs the Gorn right now with a crowd watching that includes, Homer Simpson, Howard the Duck, Gollum and about 20 other freaks and weirdos. I also give the muppet band instruments to Marvel Monsters. Cracks me up.


&gt;##4. How big is your collection ? and which is your favourite one of them ?
&gt;&gt;**Custodian_of_Oa:** I have about 200 action figures and about the same amount of toy cars
**Toys_and_Bacon:** Roughly 1000 figures, and the Bandai VF-25s are also great.  
**airbrushedvan:** Not sure how many


&gt;##5. Is there some dream action figure you plan on getting one day ? :D
&gt;&gt;**Custodian_of_Oa:** Not at this moment
**Toys_and_Bacon:** Hot Toys Avengers, which I stupidly ended up selling.  
**airbrushedvan:**  I would love some of the recent Ghostbusters figures!


&gt;##6. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Custodian_of_Oa:** Knibb High Football Rules.  
**Toys_and_Bacon:** Well, share advice, ask for advice, be helpful and kind to new subscribers.  
**airbrushedvan:** Open your packages and set up your figures! They look better and are more fun. You want mint figures? Buy a second and keep it in the package forever you sick monster.

**Gifts are hard.** I have an aunt whose gift giving intuition is sadly lacking and has unfortunately become notorious. For an example,* but I was, ya know, 18 and not 45. I could list many, many more examples, but time is short and xmas is coming.

At every gift giving occasion I live in fear of becoming my aunt. There just seems nothing worse

There's only one thing  worse than that deer in the headlights feeling of fear when you can't think of a single thing to give someone

And there is nothing *better* than when you give a gift

As it turns out there are others out there like me! But fear no more as /r/santashelpers is here just in time for one of the biggest gift giving occasions there is!

/r/santashelpers is a gift for everyone no matter your situation

The very busy head elves took some time out to talk to me about the sub:

&gt;##1. How did /r/santashelpers come to be?

&gt;&gt; **meninthemirror** The story of this subreddit's birth is pretty simple. One evening I noticed that a bunch of people were throwing up questions about good gifts in /r/AskReddit

&gt;&gt;So that's how it was created. But everything since I clicked the create subreddit button: the Rules, computer-literate, and very helpful team of moderators here. They've done most of the work to get the subreddit looking good and running smoothly. 

&gt;##2. So let's say I have someone in my life whom I have never, while visiting them, I accidentally discovered a stash in their closet of all the old gifts I'd given. :/ Every year I try harder and think this will be the year, but it never is. Can your sub help me?

&gt;&gt; **meninthemirror** We certainly hope that our subreddit can help people find good gifts! A lot of times people have trouble buying gifts for someone because they don't know what the participants in X hobby are lusting after this year. By opening up these questions to the internet at large

&gt;##3. What if someone is a great gift giver and full of ideas. Should they skip your sub?

&gt;&gt; **meninthemirror** &gt;We'd love to have more such people on board.

&gt;&gt; **ADHD_orc**  We always need people to help with gift ideas in the comments

&gt;##4. What about you guys? Are you great gift givers, when choosing gifts?

&gt;&gt; **meninthemirror** Personally, and have already bought some of the gifts.

&gt;&gt; **ADHD_orc**  It seems to run in my family for everyone to both be terrible gift givers and be extremely hard to shop for. I find the only way to get myself motivated to think about gifts is in the last minute panic of needing to shop for someone because Christmas is in 2 days. (I'm not the best example of what our subreddit is :P) 

&gt;##5. What are some of your favorite posts so far? Or favorite advice for gift giving?

&gt;&gt; **meninthemirror** My favourite post so far is probably [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/135miu/hi_rsantashelpers_im_pretty_good_at_gift_ideas/) where oliviasarus spent a lot of time and effort helping people find good gifts. 

&gt;##6. What happens to /r/santashelpers after December 26?


&gt;&gt; **meninthemirror** After December 26 we get ready for Orthodox Christmas! But seriously

&gt;&gt; **ADHD_orc**  We'll (hopefully) still get some posts about birthday gifts

&gt;##7. Is there anything I missed

&gt;&gt; **meninthemirror** I'd like to add another thank you to all the mods who've built

**We are very accepting of redditors promoting their own product (as long as they stick to the rules of course.)**

Thank you so much, and all the mods and subscribers of /r/santashelpers! 

Happy Christmas gifts to all and to all no more gift giving fright!

&gt;Hi Denny-Crane

&gt;&gt;This subreddit is /r/AR_Blood_Drive. As someone with type O- blood (universal donor), but donating blood is an incredibly important and often overlooked charitable action. As a Katrina evacuee and someone who generally pays attention to the news I always get disheartened to hear that blood banks are in dire straits because we don't think about it until it's too late. That's why it's so cool that we redditors get the chance to harness the web to make a simultaneous statement that will hopefully remind and influence others.

&gt;Can you tell us how this began?

&gt;&gt;This effort began when user ImNotJesus (who, we rose to the challenge and have begun within the span of less than a week to pull together a nascent initiative that already spans three continents. Almost halfway to our goal!

&gt;I'm most intrigued by the initiative. So instead of asking people to give blood
We do not daunt. We're asking individuals to step up where they can

&gt;&gt;But in addition to collaborating and organizing

&gt;&gt;There are media to reach (local and otherwise), and distributed, phone calls to make behind the scenes, spreadsheets to be manipulated. We'll have parallel efforts encouraging people to consider signing up as bone marrow and organ donors. We also intend to run a parallel fundraising drive to support a secular and global charity unrelated to the Red Cross for people who are unable to donate blood for any reason or people looking to otherwise channel this effort into additional good for the world.

&gt;&gt;If we're going to climb a logistical Everest like this in a single summer we'll need help in a lot of ways.

&gt;Wait. Did you say prizes? Check out ol' moneybags Denny-Crane!

&gt;&gt;Name's on the door. Yes, but we want this to be more than a simple question with an IV at the end of it.

&gt;Can we back it up just a bit? This sounds like a goddamn pyramid scheme. Who's gettin' rich here?!

&gt;&gt;The world

&gt;Alright. Why would I want to get involved? And

&gt;&gt;You want to get involved because you're positively spiffy. You're righteous in the same way the kids refer to Ferris Bueler. You want to be a part of something bigger than yourself, but it's a cliche because it's true. I wish it were as resonant as it must have been when the first person to say it put that phrase together, but even without rhetorical oomph I hope the people reading this recognize that we have to move from theory to practice, from hypothesis to experiment, if we're going to affect change.

&gt;&gt;It's the scientific method.

&gt;So how long will the AR_Blood_Drive go on for?

&gt;&gt;Well, as in, 'Annual Reddit Blood Drive'. We want to hit you back next year, and in perpetuity really.

&gt;&gt;But rather than bleed anyone dry

&gt;Let's talk results. Where does /r/AR_Blood_Drive currently stand

&gt;&gt;Technically we're still very much in the organizational stage, charity donation sites, blood donation services and other parts of reddit to explore the best avenues that we can. There's quite a bit of logistical work that's been done in setting up the subreddit (practically overnight, I might add), coordinating Prize Contributors and Blood Drive Organizers, and filling the needs of the community.

&gt;&gt;The long and short is that we're functional

&gt;Can you give us a brief summary? What about great links where we can find more information?

&gt;&gt;In terms of a great link

&gt;&gt;Just remember that we intend for this to be more than just a request to give blood. We'd like to bring reddit together for things we can all value - community engagement, but we rely on people from all corners of the world taking initiative in their own communities in order to implement said goals. There are ways to help even for people who can't give blood, so please give some careful attention to the ideas we're presenting and see if you'd like to engage your community with us.

&gt;&gt;Let's take life saving efforts viral! Issues this important should not be relegated to *Reader's Digest.* As media becomes social

&gt;&gt;This is reddit

How do you begin to explain Joe Rogan to someone

#***WALL OF TEXT ENGAGE!***

Joe Rogan is a man, or scared, of talking about subjects that other media personalities would shy away from.

Beyond his infamous role as the host of *Fear Factor*, conspiracy nut and all around kook (and I mean that in the nicest way possible!). 

He brings a certain ""Fuck it"" attitude to the table that is immediately appealing to the audience willing to open an ear. It's almost infectious. 

Joe, over-analytical stoners, who like to ask questions without reservations, and who could give two shits about what you think, then I recommend giving it a listen. 

On his podcast, sexuality, social convention,  his use and support of psycho-pharmaceuticals like mushrooms, LSD and the like, religion, existentialism, MMA fighting

He is ***edgy and offensive***. If that isn't your bag

 In a recent podcast, while you act within your life. So, for today's write-up, I wanted to try a stream of consciousness exercise.

Stream of consciousness is a narative mode

Mine will be loosely constructed and follow no real organization. I want to try and write as close to what I think

--- 

*Why is there a Kelly Clarkson song in my head? At least I think it's Kelly Clarkson song.*

*I hate it when you look at a light for a certain amount of time and then the image of the light becomes burned into your vision after you close your eyes.*

*Watching my fingers type is weird.*

*Drawstring.*

*I really like how Mike Judge

*I secretly have too many secrets.* 

*When I close my eyes and lean my head back and let the water from the shower run over my ears

*It scares me to know that there is an etire world around me that can be understood using mathmatics that is not only far beyond my comprehension

*My life is dominated by symbols and sounds. For once, pictures, beeps, rings, clicks and faps.*

*Watermelons. I remember having watermelons being served at a Church Camp I attended as a 13 year old boy

[r/JoeRogan](http://www.reddit.com/r/joerogan) is a place where you are invited to ""discuss Joe Rogan's Comedy, Mind-expanding revelations, Conspiracies, Insights, and Fitness &amp; Health."" I will admit, that a lot of the content in the community is ""inside-joke"" kind of material, so be ready to commit a little time listening to his podcasts (which are free to download and listen to on iTunes). They are, well worth your time.

After 4 years of Spanish classes

&gt;Me llamo Sid. Soy una langosta. No me gusta ollas con agua hirviendo


See? I'm speaking at a *1st grade* level. Having conquered this antiquated language

When suddenly, and never had a reason to learn more until now. But I can smell an opportunity when I come across one, and I contacted the moderators as quickly as I could. 

Who knew it had such an interesting and varied history?! It's well over a century old

pupeno, as it's quite interesting!)

&gt;Could you give us a brief overview on the history of Esperanto?

&gt;&gt;Esperanto was created in 1887 by L. L. Zamenhof. He was was born in Poland and lived in a place with people speaking four different languages and killing each other constantly. For a time he though the answer was Latin

&gt;&gt;Esperanto saw the light of day in a book called Unua Libro (First Book). At that time the language was called Lingvo Internacia (International Language) but Zamenhof was afraid his reputation as an ophthalmologist would suffer

&gt;&gt;It is said the book was a hit and only after 6 months someone knocked at Zamenhof's door wanting to speak Esperanto. Since 1905

&gt;What first got you interested in this language?

&gt;&gt;I probably have the strangest reason for learning Esperanto. When I learned English I found myself using it in ways I could not use my native Spanish because it is a little bit more flexible. In English it's much easier than in Spanish to convert nouns to verbs to adjectives and back again. So I decided to look for the most flexible of all languages to think in it. I did try learning lojban

&gt;&gt;Something very interesting happened. I started learning Esperanto at http://lernu.net and after three days I opened up the chatroom. I started talking with another person. Of course

&gt;&gt;Saluton (Hello)

&gt;&gt;Kiel vi fartas? (How are you?)

&gt;&gt;Kie vi loĝas? (Where do you live?) - you can learn the pronunciation here: http://en.lernu.net/enkonduko/lingvoprezento/alfabeto.php

&gt;&gt;Ĉu vi havas fratojn aŭ fratinojn? (Do you have brother and sisters?)

&gt;&gt;After that we kept on talking. Esperanto grammar is very simple

&gt;&gt;People obviously have a lot of different reasons for approaching the language, the desire to communicate with everybody. To do away with the idiomatic barriers, stop wasting time and money in translations as well as learning complex idiosyncratic languages.

&gt;How fluent are you in it?

&gt;&gt;Not a lot unfortunately. I know most or all the grammar, provided I'm given enough time to look lots of words in the dictionary. Even in that regard Esperanto is ahead of many languages, since many words are built from other words and modified by a system of prefixes and suffixes. It just requires more practice that I have put in it. I just moved to London so after I settle in, I'll probably join the local Esperanto club to do some practicing.

&gt;What are the benefits of learning/being fluent in Esperanto?

&gt;&gt;There are several. Some people do it in an effort to get rid of the language barrier. It's like people writing free software. The benefit is a better world for everybody.

&gt;&gt;Some people do it for traveling. Not a lot of people speak Esperanto, showing you the city, whatever. You have to speak Esperanto.

&gt;&gt;This is probably one of the most interesting reasons to learn Esperanto. Several studies have shown that if you are an English speaker and spent 1 year learning Esperanto and 4 learning French

&gt;&gt;This applies to any languages. But if you try to learn German and French it'll take you longer than just French. Only Esperanto (and other easy constructed languages) can reduce the total learning time. In the door of the Esperanto club in Buenos Aires, your first second language"".

&gt;What are some of the most interesting aspects of Esperanto? How is it different from other languages?

&gt;&gt;Esperanto is a constructed language. It is extremely regular so it's much easier to learn that natural languages that gathered a lot of idiosyncrasies over the centuries. In Esperanto you can build words. I forgot how you call a language like that. In German you can build worlds too

&gt;&gt;For example, but it is in Esperanto and you can imagine what it would mean and you can use it on a sentences and it'll be just fine.

&gt;&gt;This example is also fun. Lern- is the root word for learning. Lerni means to learn. The suffix -ej means ""the place for"", so manĝejo, manĝ -ej -o, clearly means the place to eat... dining room.

&gt;&gt;One thing that I find amazing in Esperanto is the [table of correlatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_vocabulary#Table_of_correlatives):

##(mod note: pupeno's amazing table got fucked over by the subreddit CSS, instead.)

&gt;&gt;Let me explain you with some examples. ki- means question, so kiu means ""who"". neni- means none, so nenio means nothing. If neni- means none and -u means individual, what does neniu mean? Give it a try and guess it. Yes. It means nobody.

&gt;&gt;-e means place, tie means there (oops, here English broke the rule, Esperanto didn't), ie means somewhere, ĉie means everywhere, nenie means nowhere. And so on. By knowing one row and one column you can know the whole table. That's a lot of words you don't have to learn.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Esperanto?

&gt;&gt;Yes: Dankon! (it means thanks)
Thanks for making r/Esperanto such an amazing and vibrant community. I'm really not spending any time in it (sorry

Some call it vandalism others call it art. What is graffiti? That is the question my dear [Watson.](/r/emmawatson/) For that you need to hire a psychiatrist or a philosopher for which /r/SROTD does not have the budget. All I know is that its been with us since the [Ancient Greeks &amp; Roman Empire.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti#Etymology) Enough with the [history lesson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawn) on to the new school.

Modern day graffiti seemed to be a by-product of hip-hop culture in the [1970s &amp; 80s.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD2Mb8pM6E8) But as of now

Like all things that gains mass appeal, [stenciling](/r/stencils), [stickering (its that even a word?)](/r/sticker) and even [light graffiting](/r/LightGraffiti). While I'm naming names I should also mention /r/bombing, /r/streetart and even /r/bleachshirts!

&gt;##1. Since when did you like enjoying graffiti?

&gt;&gt;**epicoolguy** When I was about 7 I saw my brother spray painting

&gt;&gt;**Frank_Jesus** I live in Buenos Aires

&gt;##2. Are you a graffiti artist yourself? If so

&gt;&gt;**epicoolguy** I used to

&gt;&gt;**Frank_Jesus** I have only done some small stencils to subvert ads in the US. I don't have any pictures of that.

&gt;##3. Who is your favorite graffiti artist(s)? Post some of there work.

&gt;&gt;**epicoolguy** Bansky

&gt;&gt;**Frank_Jesus** My favorite artist is Blu. The work he's done is impressive on a scale that I can't quantify. Here's the first piece I ever saw by [him.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuGaqLT-gO4)

&gt;##4. In your personal view is all graffiti

&gt;&gt;**epicoolguy** I believe that good graffiti is worthy of the street art title

&gt;&gt;**Frank_Jesus** I'm all for artists breaking into commercial viability through subverting cultural norms. I'm a little bit over Bansky -- more because he's become a brand, there's a crew that tags over the work of people who took time and thought to create their pieces. I don't know what the point is of that. It's like saying, ""I'll vandalize your art,"" and it seems destructive and purposeless.

&gt;##5. Tell us about your community?

&gt;&gt;**epicoolguy** I've been a mod for a couple months now

 &gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;**epicoolguy** HI MOM!

###Brains brainsssssssssssssssssssssss baraaaaaaaaaaainsssss

**25070** survivors that have been fighting the good fight in the zombie apocalypse for over **THREE** years now.

First off

I love the fact there is a whole genre for zombies movies. With such a wide range of movies and even tv shows. From the [hilarious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWw9vE39IGc&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=41s) to the [retro classic.](http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/bestzombiemovies?pg=26) With high production tv shows like [The Walking Dead](http://www.amctv.com/shows/the-walking-dead) we get our brain fix on a hopefully weekly basis. Me gusta to that! The fact that there are over [15 movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_zombie_films) which have zombies in them just in 2011 is a sign of there significance in our [culture.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=kfVsfOSbJY0#t=45s)

For me personally

Now

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA ""Come on

&gt;##Since when have you been on r/Zombie / What brought you to r/Zombie? / Why do you like zombies?
&gt;&gt; I created r/zombies when the admins first announced the creation of subreddits because I just kind of wanted a place to store links related to my obsession. I had no idea that people would actually want to hang out there. It's been a very nice surprise over the last few years see the kind of community that's grown up around our corner or the horror sandbox.

&gt;##In 5 words describe your favorite type / kind of Zombie.
&gt;&gt; Rotting and hungry for flesh.

&gt;## If you were a zombie
&gt;&gt;  Great question. In this order: 1. My wife (I've bitten her before, braiiins!"") 4. Christina Hendricks (my only chance with her) 5. George Romero (he deserves immortality)

&gt;&gt; * [Night of the Living Dead (1969)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/)
* [Return of the Living Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089907/)
* [Shawn of the Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_of_the_Dead)

&gt;## Are you friendly to other monsters of the night or are you exclusive to loving zombies? (Ex, Frankenstein monster) Which ones &amp; why?

&gt;&gt; r/zombies is exclusive to zombies, but--with a few exceptions--too angsty for us. And werewolves... well, everyone loves a puppy until they pee on the carpet.

We, lump together everyone else together and label them as *the other*, then just let the hatred flow - the more hatred the better (especially if you have experienced discrimination in your own life, because nothing balances out discrimination better than hatred).

&gt;&gt; **RichardDorkins:** I hate it when they support the suffering of children in Africa

&gt;&gt; **Bittervirus:** The fact that they're all ""You gonna eat that?"" and then take it anyway.

&gt;&gt; **culturalelitist:** So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was.It was a little old lady, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to."" Very loudly, I said ""Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.

&gt;&gt; **Bittervirus:** I saw a man handing out little pamphlets about Jesus. He sees me, and in the end I did take a pamphlet because it's only polite you know?
Needless to say

&gt;&gt; **RichardDorkins:** I have once seen a skytheist try to explain how religion has helped her abandon a life of drug abuse and crime and how she felt that ""gOD"" had saved her. A brave warrior of reason logic'd her by pointing out how her bad choices make her an untrustworthy person

***Rileyxradio's Guide to Visiting Oklahoma

Now y'all need to know that I was born

In my college years

The city I lived in, Oklahoma. Notable features to Durant: a casino, a lake and top rated Panda Express and a Walmart filled with people whose best option in life was to live in Oklahoma, sans the ones that were shipped there shamelessly by the government, but that's another can of corn beef hash. 

I was invited up by a friend who had just recently had to me into Oklahoma

The first stop her and I made happen to be for an al fresco lunch out on the beaches of Lake Texoma. The sun was high, trash condoms and broken plastics. It was creepy to say the least. 45 mins walking distance from the entrance of the beach front, we thought about who had been here and why. 

It started raining around 3PM so we high-tail it back to my truck, I threw up my arms and came to terms with the fact that I had a stuck-truck on my hands, with no real form of help immediately available.

The young woman I was with said that her brother had a truck with a winch on it, he still lived in Texas and was still at work so It would be a few hours before he could come pry us out of our debacle. 

During out time waiting me and my lady-friend listen to music

A few hours later, haters gonna hate. 

After all that, the fates that be decided I needed to go to the casino. Maybe money, free drinks and the glazed over faces of slot players in their 50's chain-smoking their life away would make me feel better? 

It didn't. I lost money. UGH. Well played house

It was getting late

***WORST. IDEA. EVER.*** 

The first mistake I made was parking on the side of the building, in a town I didn't know. 

After dicking around in Walmart for a while

I turn and ask my friend if she left the chairs in that position and she said no and it hits me. 

POW!

My car had been broken into. Apparently, and each items approximate worth, as it appears on the official police report I flied with the Durant Police Deprartment:

1 - 80GB iPod Classic - $300

2 - Nikon D80 Body - $350

3 - 2 Camera Lenes -  $600

4 - Nikon Mounted Flash Unit - $125

5 - Car Keys - ??

6 - Disc Golf Discs - $50

So let's take a moment and recap what has happened to me at this point

* Found a creepy pedo-den in the woods.

* Got my car stuck in the wet send for a few hours

* Missed out on hooking up with a girl

* Lost money at the casino (should have seen that one coming)

* Got over $1000 worth of stuff along with my keys stolen out of my car due to a terrible lapse in judgement.

I am now stranded in Oklahoma with a girl at Walmart

1.) Remove Battery from truck. 

2.) Remove misc fuses from under dash

3.) Buy and install a steering-wheel lock

At this point, filed a police report and talked with Walmart Security to make sure they knew what happened. All in all I had hung around Wally-World for a good 2 hours more than I expected making multiple trips inside since I had no where else to go.

Cars came and went

As I exited the store again later, I walked over to investigate the screaming black pickup that was parked only a few spaces down from mine. Since U had been there for so long, I had seen this car drive up and the man standing by the open door of the truck was not the 17-19 year old I saw exit the vehicle upon it's arrival to the warehouse store. 

I accuse the man of breaking into these cars and ask him to come inside with me. He refuses. My adrenaline slowly subsided and I began to think about if this guy had a gun, and quickly backed off. I asked him to show me his ID, I'll take down his information and licence plate number and we will call it square, he could leave. He willingly showed me his ID, which I would later find out was old and useless, and I will never forget his name, there in cold black oklahoma issued plastic:

ROBERT BLEDSOE.

Robert Bledsoe the fucking asshole from Durant Oklahoma


TL;DR - Really shitty day in the Godforsaken Land of Oklahoma. Found a creepy pedo-den in the woods. Got my car stuck in the wet send for a few hours. Missed out on hooking up with a girl. Lost money at the casino (should have seen that one coming). Got over $1000 worth of stuff along with my keys stolen out of my car due to a terrible lapse in judgement. Met the guy who broke into my car and stranded me in OK. His name was Robert Bledsoe.

When doing a writeup for /r/SubredditoftheDay, I went ahead and asked /r/ExplainLikeImCalvin's mods if they would kindly answer a few questions for me. They almost immediately told me, ""Yes!"", and a couple of days later I sent them the questions.

So why

Simple: moderators [Raelshark](http://www.reddit.com/user/Raelshark), read, or write English. 

If you look at their comment histories you might find that hard to believe, they didn't realize that if you don't use a language you know at least five minutes every day your brain will forget it for all time. 

Why is that? Well, and languages require a *lot* of disk space. So in order to keep space free for it to store the latest kitten video or episode of *American Pickers*, it's constantly checking to see if it can remove anything non-essential. If you choose not to use a language that it currently has ""installed"" for more than 24 hours, it deletes it permanently. While this does, indeed, free up a bunch of room the downside is that, well

Sadly, and LordGaGa didn't know this. That's why they now only speak their native [Munsee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsee_language) language which, like Norton Antivirus, is notoriously difficult to uninstall. In vain I searched for an Algonquian translator so that I could conduct the interview for this writeup but, alas, Algonquians are in short supply these days.

What I'm sure they would tell you if they still spoke and/or wrote English anymore is that /r/ExplainLikeImCalvin is a subreddit inspired by two things:

* The popular subreddit /r/ExplainLikeImFive and

* the wisdom of the smartest dad ever: Calvin's father

Basically

In all seriousness, and LordGaGa for creating and maintaining this wonderful subreddit. I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to do the interview, but hey, at least it gave me a decent idea for this writeup! Thanks also to the 2,300+ members of this community for keeping Calvin's dad alive, in subreddit-form. Now, if you could answer me one simple thing:

We at Subreddit of the Day, it's what life's all about, right?  Those who give a little bit, get a lot in return if you have the right mindset?  So today we feature [/r/couchsurfing](/r/couchsurfing) - a great subreddit that's more than just finding a place to crash while travelling (or since your girlfriend / bandmates / mom kicked you to the curb).

On the surface, mind you), couchsurfing is about kindness &amp; experiences.  Sharing a meal with someone from another country, taking someone to your favourite local spots &amp; sharing your knowledge, teaching someone your local customs, sharing some culture.  Give a little bit, get a lot in return.  And what if you're the stranger in a strange land?  Be a a guest, be a friend!  This giving isn't a one way street bubs!  Give as much as you get!!

If you're on the fence or slightly interested in the couchsurfing culture

Now

&gt;Hey big Poppa

&gt;&gt;Good question my adopted son, there isn’t one. Deal with it. You probably aren’t that interesting any ways.

&gt;&gt;Couchsurfing is simple: Have a couch? Check. Like to meat new people? Check. Awesome. Why not let a fellow Redditor come crash on your barren, avoid eye contact at all costs) Want to go visit San Francisco, but don’t want to spend half your budget paying for a hotel? No problem, crash on some ones couch in SF and not feel like a broke tourist. Instead, hang out with a new friend that will show you around while you feel like a broke tourist (seriously though, I’m not joking when I say avoid any and all eye contact)

&gt;How does /r/couchsurfing differ from couchsurfing.org?

&gt;&gt;It doesn’t really. Well actually, and instead has CondeNast pay for our servers! We’re clever like that...

&gt;&gt;Granted

&gt;How successful is your subreddit? Are redditors actually crashing with other redditors?

&gt;&gt;I’d say we are pretty successful! We have a really interesting and diverse group of people. We reallly don’t focus too much on couchsurfing hookups as much as we do just talk about couchsurfing in general: funny stories, girls that weren’t really girls, advice for the warry, and all around fun conversations. But that’s only one half of the sub, the other two halves are hosts and travelers. We, believe it or not, have a lot of interreddit couchsurfing. Which is great! Except I_RAPE_CATS is no longer allowed around. It should go without saying.

&gt;Philosophically

&gt;&gt;I’m not even going to start dividing by zero... I’m too afraid to answer this question. I’m sorry. Let’s just say that I used to be a socially awkward penguin myself

&gt;How active are you in the couchsurfing scene? What have your experiences been like?

&gt;&gt;I, 2005. I remember the day like it was yesterday. A good friend and I, fresh out of Highschool and new to college, wanted to experience, first hand, the legendary party scene that was UCSB on Halloween. We believed it to be nothing more than myth, talked only around campfires, while debating its very existence.
We managed to meetup with some cool people online (crossing our fingers they weren’t predators. They claimed not to have a van, I thought I made a huge mistake. Every one that lived there looked like they were in gang and we were about to be drug mules. Turns out, I was completely wrong. They turned out to be some of the funnest people I have ever met in my entire life. They also taught me about alcohol limits -- aparently there aren’t any, and you should just keep drinking. Haha...

&gt;&gt;From there I was hooked. I began couchsurfing whenever I had the chance. I met so many new, hammock, and I kid you not, treehouse from Washington state to Florida.

&gt;&gt;In fact

&gt;I'd like to get involved. Please tell me my next steps!

&gt;&gt;Absolutely! Drag yourself over to /r/couchsurfing, you can’t go wrong.

/r/freebies is a really fantastic subreddit.  Now, we may add a bit too much hyperbole to our daily posts.  And I'll be the first to admit it, too much hyperbole can spoil the brew-ha-ha.  It's not possible that every subreddit we feature is drop dead gorgeous with big boobs and a job, right?  It just can't be!

Well what if everything up until now has all been a lead-up to this moment?  What if all those ""amazing"" subreddits we've written about were merely foundation, and they come after /r/freebies.  They were small time then, just posting small shit.  They come to their home in the afternoon looking for their business.  They find their readers in the house and decide to wait for /r/freebies.  They come home to find their posts downvoted and their readers screaming.  The Hungarians knew /r/freebies was tough.  Not to be trifled with. They tell /r/freebies they want their posts.  /r/freebies looks over the faces of their readers, then they showed these men of will what will really was.  They told the Hungarians that they would rather see their readers downvoted than live another day after this.  

/r/freebies lets the last Hungarian go, their cats too.  And like that, *(whoo!)*, they're subreddit of the day.  They become a myth, a spook story that other mods tell their kids at night.  If you rat on your pop, /r/freebies will get you!  And nobody really ever believes.  Keaton always said, ""I don't believe in qgyh2, and the only thing that scares me is /r/freebies.

&gt;Please tell us how /r/freebies began

&gt;&gt;It started

&gt;Tell us about your community - what are the posters &amp; commenters like?

&gt;&gt;That's an interesting question. Some would say that we're just cheapskates looking for a free ride or something while others point out that the freebies exist because the ones giving them out want to give them out and by asking for them we're helping them advertise. I think that it's difficult to boil down the answer in to anything definitive because like much of reddit /r/freebies is populated by all kinds of people

&gt;Are freebies typically geographically oriented? Local

&gt;&gt;We've seen all of the above. Many of them seem to be US-centric

&gt;This may be subjective

&gt;&gt;[This one](http://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/idmgu/free_random_stuff/) was probably the most interesting and unexpected one: ""I'm trying to a do a pointless project where I send random stuff to 1 person in every state. The first person from each state to comment will get a random package.""

After yesterdays crazy day full of brave Ron Paul lovers

With a show of hands

Interesting. Almost half of you. Ok I lied. I can't really see if you raised your hand or not. But in this day and age where there's pretty much an app for everything (including a kindle app)

So I was having this discussion with my dad over which one is better. I'll admit

So this place, head on over there.

And now

&gt;##1. Who started this sub and what was the inspiration for it?


&gt;&gt; jhra: I didn't start this Reddit but I adopted it a few years ago with only a handful of subscribers and no trades. From there it was a long haul to get active users and find a system that worked for everyone.


&gt;&gt; aelon: jhra just brought me in a few months ago here. I think there is a need to have a book exchange as part of the exchange realm of Reddit.


&gt;##2. What is /r/bookexchange?

&gt;&gt; jhra: Book exchange is a trust dependant Reddit where users swap books world wide in the name of reading

&gt;&gt; aelon: r/bookexchange is the (un)official book exchange of Reddit :) You could swap for physical (and some digital copies) of books, I know some user who begs for books gains downvote whether in comments or post. If you are subscribing r/books, you should subscribe to r/bookexchange next. Sharing is caring.


&gt;##3. Do you participate in sending/receiving books often?

&gt;&gt; jhra: I used to be pretty active with sending out books but work has limited my Reddit time.

&gt;&gt; aelon: In sending yes. I share some books I got after reading it. Most active users in the community love to received books. In receiving books not really. I prefer to send than to get one. There might be some individuals who need it most than me. Even in post-Digg era ( I am a solid digg fan before)


&gt;##4. How do you encourage people to send books?

&gt;&gt; aelon: Since I joined the mod team

&gt;##5. What do you do as a mod?

&gt;&gt; aelon: I feel like I am the active big brother here. We respond to whatever the demands of the growing community. If something is reported we weigh things down by checking their previous post. If this guy is legit, some users makes a complains on their recent bad exchange and we help them resolve the problem . We try to settle things in a friendly way by sending them a PM. If after some time (usually a week) the accused is not responding or not cooperative, we regret to say that we ban those username and put their address in the list of scammers. But they can fix it, whether to start a new username or by DM us and explain the situation. We are here to help. Just to give you an overview of our banned list, we only have a handful of usernames in the list.

&gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; aelon: Suggestions are always welcome. We love to hear our users.

&gt;&gt; We have an expanding community

&gt;&gt; We are rolling out some changes like the CSS, we are working on stuff that will work for everyone.

**Zordon** Teleport to us 5 overbearing and overemotional humans.

**Zordon** Thats correct

**Alpha 5** I was afraid of that.

With a [killer face melting theme song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pQYtmb-f0w) this was the beginning of a beautiful and hilarious cornball series. Whats not to love? Nothing thats what. In the middle of 1993, 1 part teenage ninjas, 1 part colorful spandex outfits, 1 part B-movie monsters, 100,000 parts cheeseball comedy. ITS GOLD JERRY GOLD!

Can you believe this series has been on the air for 19 years? It almost is giving [the Simpsons](/r/theSimpsons) a run for its money... Who am I kidding

I've actually asked many mid 20 somethings about power rangers, I think its called Power Ranger MEGAFORCE whatever you medicine, if it comes in 5 colors and than later updated to 6 or 7 you know where to get it.

Just a heads up, I'm a mod for this subreddit, but I only did the brand spanking new CSS for it. So yeah, [deal with it.](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs4/1361098_o.gif)

&gt;1 Where did you first hear about Power Rangers? Tell us a little story.

&gt;&gt; **professorwhat** I honestly don't remember how and when I started watching Power Rangers. My second birthday party had a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers tablecloth

&gt;&gt; **Gooflactus** I actually remember watching the first episodes of Power Rangers when I was about 4-5 years old, special effects , giant robots, it had it all. Since then I have tried to keep up to date on the series. I actually learned about Super Sentai only a few years ago, and have started watching that/trying to catch up. Good thing is each season has its own team/story so its easy to just jump right in.

&gt;2 Which series is your favorite. Whats your favorite episode

&gt;&gt; **professorwhat** My favorite series for Power Rangers would have to be Power Rangers Lost Galaxy. I remember watching it with my best friend at his house when we were both little all the time. I realize that the 'nostalgia effect, and I am loving it. Close seconds include Power Rangers Jungle Fury, Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, and Power Rangers SPD.

&gt;&gt; My favorite Super Sentai is probably Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger, because it really feels natural and like something that would happen in the real world. Moreover, the Dekarangers all have their own fun quirks and you really get to observe them develop as a team. Even their Sixth Ranger, who transfers from a different operational specialty, gets in and becomes seamlessly integrated into Special Police Dekaranger Earth's structure, as can be seen in the Deka Red vs. Deka Break Special DVD. I also like Shinkenger a lot, but that's more for the omnipresent theatrics than any other reason.

&gt;&gt; My favorite episode is a bit of a tougher decision,' and I watched that seven times). I like most episodes due to the formulaic nature of the shows, but the closest to a 'favorite' might be 'Lost &amp; Found in Translation' from Power Rangers Dino Thunder, where the Dino Rangers sit down and watch an episode of 'Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger' for a class project to compare two different cultures. It holds an important message at the end: just because something is different doesn't mean that it should be judged.

&gt;&gt; **Gooflactus** Power Rangers Zeo cause I thought it had the coolest Zords, try not to smile [seeing this](http://i.imgur.com/uU0wZ.gif). Plus RPM was fantastic also, again it was just a great story.

&gt;&gt;In terms of Sentai though, plus they were Pirates.

&gt;3 Do you like the original Japanese version (Super Sentai) or the Updated American versions? Why?

&gt;&gt; **professorwhat** I honestly like both and don't understand why people hold one up over the other. They're kid's shows meant to advertise toys. I find that even when a Power Rangers series is a near translation of its Super Sentai counterpart

&gt;&gt;Lost Galaxy is a brilliant exhibition of this

&gt;&gt;Some argue that Power Rangers Samurai exists as a counterexample, gradual growth in Emily as a character.

&gt;&gt; **Gooflactus**I like both for different reasons. I think it all depends on how Saban/Disney really adapted the sentai footage per season.

&gt;&gt;Like Power Rangers RPM vs. Engine Sentai Go-onger. One has the last survivors of the Robot Apocalypse trying to fight for their life in the last surviving dome city(RPM) while the other is about Humans and Cars from another Dimension fighting monsters that try to pollute the world(Go-Onger). I like the robot version better.

&gt;&gt;But then there is Power Rangers Samurai vs. Samurai Sentai Shinkenger

&gt;4 What other shows do you like that are similar to Power Rangers?

&gt;&gt; **professorwhat** I've been getting into Kamen Rider lately (Fourze and Decade). I never really watched any other similar shows before this year, and Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog just too weird. I'd never even heard of VR Troopers until a few years after it finished its run. I want to get into Tiger and Bunny, but I don't currently have a reliable source to watch it from.

&gt;&gt; **Gooflactus** I was always a huge fan of ""The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog"". It was like power rangers (fighting monsters/transforming with suits"") But it was based in Irish mythology and set in a fantasy world. So instead of Spandex Suits and Lasers. It was focused on Suits of Armor and medieval battles

&gt;5 Tell us a funny Power Rangers story if you have one.

&gt;&gt; **professorwhat** Well, I'm proud of what I like.

&gt;6 What would you want from a bigger /r/PowerRangers community?

&gt;&gt; **professorwhat** Memes (in the vein of Bridge's buttery toast and his various ranger forms), so there's definitely a lot to talk about. Right now, we're mainly a news and zord-based subreddit, but I'm sure with a little bit of work, we can be just as buttery as every other fandom-based subreddit out there!

&gt;&gt; **Gooflactus** I really like the way things are going now. Especially since only about a a year ago this place was a ghost town. But something I would love to try to add is more discussion about new episodes

&gt;7 Open mic

&gt;&gt; **professorwhat** If an Power Ranger and a Kamen Rider got into a fight

&gt;&gt;Moreover, then the Blue Ranger, then the Red Ranger! And Tommy, who was pretty much every color. And Adam Park, who just keeps coming back. They're all better than Dex, at any rate.

&gt;&gt;... Buttery!

*Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.* - **Douglas Adams**

*Ever since there have been people, but we are part of a species where some members of the species do—to the benefit of us all.* - **Neil deGrasse Tyson**

*Since, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring--not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive... If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.* - **Carl Sagan**

*Let me end with an explanation of why I believe the move into space to be a human imperative. It seems to me obvious in too many ways to need listing that we cannot much longer depend upon our planet's relatively fragile ecosystem to handle the realities of the human tomorrow. Unless we turn human growth and energy toward the challenges and promises of space, of stumbling into a cycle of fratricide and regression which could end all chances of our evolving further or of even surviving.* - **Gene Roddenberry**

*The eyes of the world now look into space, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.... I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.* - **John F.

And we're back. Sorry about the confusion yesterday, JM and Jax continued browsing /r/spacedicks (together), and Potato and I continued reading about Justin Beiber's personal life.

That's when shit hit the fan. Dad got so mad we weren't giving him the drunk attention he so desperately needed

**""Enough is enough! I'm tired of all of you not paying attention to me. I'm pulling the plug on /r/subredditoftheday. NO MORE POSTS FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK""**

Now Jax didn't really care since he already did his post for the week and neither did JM since he's not posting anything this week. So they continued looking at what they call ""the most glorious of glorious penises"".

But the rest of us protested and pleaded. 

By the end of it all, he decided that he might have gone too far. Not with the beating, but with taking /r/subredditoftheday away from us. So he agreed to give it back to us.

But only on the condition that we call him a pretty pretty princess every time we see him.

2. I'm not going to let a bunch of asshats ruin themed week for me. I'm a girl. I love themed shit. Therefore, [I give no fucks and have no regrets](http://i.imgur.com/ca7O9.gif)

Now enough of the fuck yous. Let's talk about movies.

I'm not the biggest fan of movies. And when I say that, movies weren't just a plot line for me anymore. It was seeing how much the filmmakers are pushing their limits with the story, the camera angles, everything.

For those of you that are interested

So anyway

With over 800

I really don't need to say much about this sub. As a default subreddit


&gt;##1. How long have you been a moderator for this sub and what made you want to be?

&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift** Since March of this year. I wanted to see what I could bring to the table as a moderator of such a large community

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** Since March 2012

&gt;&gt; **girafa** Since March 2012. I wanted to help maintain a place conducive to film discussion on a more fruitful level. It's hard to find that.

&gt;##2. What's the most challenging thing about being a mod? How many hours do you put into it?


&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift** Judgement calls on suspicious content. It's easy to identify and pick off obvious spam


&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** Exercising restraint with provokative individuals. I think that's one of the hardest parts of every moderators job

&gt;&gt; **girafa** Challenging? Catching spammers and bad threads quickly. 2hours a day at most. On my phone at work



&gt;##3. What do you like most about modding?

&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift** Being able to be part of such a good community. I especially like being able to assist users with general help

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** I mainly deal with stuff quietly as and when I see them


&gt;&gt; **girafa**  Being able to clean this place up. You can find cynical, visited daily, for over a year before becoming a mod, and I believe I got a real bead on the pulse of what this place is, could be, and what the more active users are looking for. Intelligent conversation shouldn't be splintered off to other subreddits to make room for memes, circlejerking, I breathe this information



&gt;##4. What are some of your favorite movies?

&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift** I've not been able to enjoy many movies in this day and age, Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison, Star Wars Episodes 4-6, Dark Knight, Dr. Strangelove, and all of the Marx brothers movies.


&gt;&gt; **girafa** Favorite films: Unforgiven, Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Blade Runner, Chinatown, Good Bad &amp; Ugly, Runaway Train, Yojimbo, Aguirre

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** Say what you will about The Matrix, mainly because I grew up with computers and hacking and all sorts. I'm now a Linux sysadmin, so I'm sure you can see why. Aside from that, I love:

* 300
* Ace Ventura
* Anchorman
* Dumb and Dumber
* Equilibrium
* The Hangover
* Howl's Moving Castle
* Inception
* Most Jackass movies
* Kick-Ass
* Law Abiding Citizen
* The Mask
* Office Space
* Shaun of the Dead
* Snatch
* Spirited Away
* Star Trek (2009)
* Superbad



&gt;##5. Tell us a little about yourself. Are you in the movie biz IRL?

&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift**  I'm 23 years old

&gt;&gt; **girafa** Yes

&gt;##6. For a big subreddit like this

&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift** Just the idea that I can be of service to such a large community is enough to keep me going. That and helping others in general.

&gt;&gt; **girafa** No idea. Compulsion.


&gt;##7. What other subs do you mod?

&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift**  I created and moderate /r/SubredditDrama. I also moderate /r/wallpaper

&gt;&gt; **girafa**  /r/movies is the only sub I mod


&gt;##8. Any last things you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; **ZeroShift** I love you guys in /r/movies

&gt;&gt; **Orbixx** I'd like to reinforce the statement in my prior interview for /r/unitedkingdom

Thank you mods for a great interview!

Can you guess which questions belong in [/r/AskSocialScience](/r/AskSocialScience) and which one does not?  Let's play!

*Why do my kids take turns having emotional meltdowns? In the past 6 years, you just lost your shit.  Glad I'm not crazy like you!""*

*When you're nice to people and in turn they don't trust you or your motives

*Why are we nicest to strangers and often mean to those who we love?*

*How does my body know? When I take medicine to magically addthree inches to my penis

Social science, practice and research.  No, wait.  That's not it, let's try again.  It's the place where you can ask questions about society and human behaviours, and answers will be provided based on ""good science"".  We'll go with that, although I prefer my first attempt.

If you're the type of redditor who enjoys the insightful and creative questions in /r/AskReddit, likes their communities to be smart and *99.9% jerk free*,  this is the subreddit for you.  Welcome to [/r/AskSocialScience](/r/AskSocialScience)!

Our feature today is somewhat similar to my porn time, intelligent discussion goes out.  I think you'll like this one today.  If you do, please upvote it.  Yesterday's miserable upvote total made me think that there's some truth to the theory that as subreddits get larger, the quality goes right downhill.  Perhaps this is a question for today's guest moderator and my new favourite friend, jambarama!

&gt;Please explain what we'll find at your subreddit.

&gt;&gt;[/r/asksocialscience](/r/asksocialscience) hopes to provide expert answers to questions involving social sciences. We hope you'll find interesting questions

&gt;I'm interested in the Panel of Experts you advertise. Please enlighten us.

&gt;&gt;The list of experts each have a related graduate degree or a bachelor's degree with related work experience. Each expert has verified his/her credentials

&gt;What is the reason [/r/AskSocialScience](/r/AskSocialScience) exists? What purpose does it serve?

&gt;&gt;[/r/askscience](/r/askscience) has a great model, sociology, economics, anthropology, and other disciplines which were underrepresented among the panelists, questions, and attention given in askscience. So the same purpose as askscience

&gt;This community has a very active moderator team

&gt;&gt;as mods we actually remove very little. We haven't hit the critical mass that askscience has hit, well intentioned, and willing to provide sources when asked. So as mods, most of what we do is verifying experts, freeing questions from the spam filter, and occasionally removing comments that include personal attacks, unsourced &amp; unfounded political speculation

&gt;What's your vision of /r/AskSocialScience? Where are we going? Any surprises in store for us?

&gt;&gt;we'd love to get more experts in some areas &amp; more experts with more specialties. Currently, this matches the questions we get - many more about economics than other disciplines - but I really hope that changes.

&gt;&gt;When questions don't get expert replies, so no surprises - though we do rotate through our mascots, so we'll get a new one up soon.

No he didn’t. Of course He didn’t. I’ve never met him, and I did happen to have a camera with me, I would not have been angry. I would not have been upset. I would not even have stopped to question the situation, because that is frontpage material right there. Guaranteed. I would be too busy having an 80’s-style rich-guy montage of all the lovely karma activities (karma baths, flying over cities in a hot air balloon throwing karma to the peasants, lighting my cigars with karma) to even wonder how in the world Sam Jack ended up in my kitchen. 
It would go straight to the top

What’s so very interesting about celebrities and great feats of endurance and incredible works of dedication and craft and all the other stuff that makes up the frontpage? They’re just people. Like us. People doing things (Or, perhaps your turnip has a funny face? Its still just a story about a person, albeit one made of turnip… actually, there could be some mileage in that, if anyone wants to create /r/FacesOfTurnip I solemnly promise to feature you on SrotD once you hit 700 subscribers), so why not have somewhere where we can be honest about our borderline-psychotic obsession with the banal everyday occurrences in the lives of others?


/r/MildlyInteresting provides just such an outlet. Want to tell a bunch of strangers about the time your shopping bill was exactly the amount of loose change in your pocket? Now you can. Want to read about my turnip that looks like Samual L. Jackson? Now you can. It’s half /r/TIL, doginabathtub, to fill you in on the details…


&gt;## Why was this place created? What started it all? 

&gt;&gt; I saw a post in /r/wtf (this one) that was telling off people in /r/wtf for posting only mildly interesting things. The desired effect was to inspire more content but it got me thinking that it could be nice to have a place where redditors could post things that were, but things that make you go, ""huh, that's something."" It fills a space that reddit was lacking, which is why I think it became successful. Also, there was a quite popular post made during the Super Bowl that helped bring attention to the subreddit ([this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/pbqim)), so that helped.

&gt;## How did the other mods get involved?

&gt;&gt; I've known bhrossman in real life for what seems like many years and he's a hoopy frood, okay."" So there was some serious favoritism going on with his appointment.

&gt;&gt; And APunchInTheTeeth just asked nicely and he seemed like a good guy. And

&gt;## What is the most interesting thing that happened to you this week?

An undeniable personality, the community is active and the content is about lefties! What more could you ask for? I highly suggest browsing through the submission history or posting a question/link of your own!

I am a dog person. Not afraid to say it. I prefer dogs to cats. Matter of fact, well, that's the next level for dog greatness. At least /r/dogswearinghats agrees with me. My dog may be a reluctant hat wearer but there are some dogs that love it. Dogs with hats on as far as the eye can see, [even at night](http://i.imgur.com/zZvzQR6.jpg).

That's what cats don't have. [Besides this picture](http://www.petswithhats.com/pets/Cats/Miserable%20cat%20with%20a%20hat%20on.jpg) which isn't even a *real* hat. A cat wearing a hat is no where near as awesome. Go over to /r/catswearinghats and have a look. Exactly, get the [shoes and it'll make an outfit](http://www.loldig.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/funny-gif-animation-bulldog-in-shoes-walking.gif).

Dog shoes may be too much but dog hats are where it's at. By no means should Redditors enforce hats upon dogs who don't want them (I'm sure they'll let you know) but /r/dogswearinghats might be your kinda place if you want to see awesome dogs in awesome hats. [Look at this dog from Peru who is chill as fark wearing a hat and some garments](http://i.imgur.com/N0WHDWA.jpg)

I posed some questions for the moderators over at /r/dogswearinghats

&gt;##1. Is there a story of origin behind /r/dogswearinghats?

&gt;&gt; **TheT0KER** I'm a long time dog owner and a long time hat wearer. When I first discovered Reddit I was really surprised that there wasn't any community devoted to it.

&gt;##2. Do you have a favourite submission?

&gt;&gt; **TheT0KER** Pretty much any of the submissions by /r/dogswearinghats .

&gt;&gt; **Igazsag** There are far too many choices for me to pick only one submission as a favourite

&gt;&gt; **bigbreathein24** I really like birthday party dogs :) http://imgur.com/r/dogswearinghats/6oHwvuS

&gt;##3. Why is a dog wearing a hat better than a dog not wearing a hat?

&gt;&gt; **TheT0KER** I see no difference from a dog wearing a hat and a dog not wearing a hat.... other than the dog wearing a hat looks alot more bad ass.

&gt;&gt; **Igazsag** A dog wearing a hat is much better than a dog not wearing a hat because hats do a very good job of expressing a dogs personality. The added anthropomorphization certainly doesn't hurt anything either.

&gt;&gt; **bigbreathein24** Because hats are great, it makes them look like a person.

&gt;##4. Do you own a any dogs? And do they constantly wear hats?

&gt;&gt; **TheT0KER** Yes

&gt;&gt; **Igazsag** Yes, but Sam doesn't seem to care.

&gt;&gt; **bigbreathein24** I have a beagle. He likes fuzzy hats like winter hats :)

&gt;##5. Finally

&gt;&gt; **TheT0KER** Keep putting those hats on those dogs and keep posting them here. 

&gt;&gt; **Igazsag** I don't think I could adequately express my thanks to all of the subscribers here on /r/dogswearinghats for making this subreddit such an excellent place

&gt;&gt; **bigbreathein24** I love that this is a subreddit.

Big love to /r/dogswearinghats for not shaving dogs and making their dogs look awesome with hats. For more dogs with hats head over to /r/dogswearinghats. It's all in the name.

Lots of love,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,t3_1gwh53

2100 collectors

----
Once upon a time

/r/DVDCollection is a subreddit dedicated to the sharing of our movie collections.  Not even just movie collections.  DVDs of them.  The legal thing that people buy to get access to movies and tv shows.  It's a hard concept to grasp to me at times.  It's all about the features.  The artwork.  The appreciation of fine art... or stupid comedies.  Really, keep informed on specials to add to your own collection.

I present to you - /r/DVDCollection.  Please enjoy the interview with the four mods of the group:  /u/Charlesp22, and /u/TheFatKid4Life.

----

&gt;Why DVD collection and not Blu-ray collection? Aren't you worried you'll become outdated?

&gt;&gt;**Charlesp22** - DVD stands for Digital Video Disc - DVD, we even get some VHS, Laserdisc, Film, and even some CED movie discs.

&gt;&gt;**Stalked_Like_Corn** - There is still a pretty big demand for DVD's. They are extremely cheap and can be played almost anywhere. BluRay

&gt;&gt;**Duals902** - I think DVD appeals to most users as DVD is probably the most common form of collecting right now (Also shorter than Blu-Ray). That being said we welcome all different types of collections. Itd be rough to appeal to all collectors of movies because there are so many different types of collections.

&gt;&gt;**TheFatKid4Life** - I think ""DVDCollection"" and not ""BlurayCollection"" because of the ubiquitous nature of the format. Most everyone can watch a DVD but many people haven't taken the leap to Blu-ray yet. I personally didn't make the leap until the first week of April and I still buy DVDs half the time. That brings up the next reason: the library of DVD releases is still much much larger than the library of Blu-ray releases.

&gt;Why collect DVDs when we have the Internet - with Netflix

&gt;&gt;**Charlesp22** - Physical media gives us cover art, special features like deleted scenes, commentaries by the cast and crews, extra documentaries or featurettes, all of which you lose out on when you simply download the movie alone. Plus, it is a hobby. I think it is good for people to have hobbies like collecting stamps, model trains, it brings communities together. Also

&gt;&gt;**Stalked_Like_Corn** - Internet and internet services go down. You're also at the mercy of them on when/if content is available. With Hulu some content is available only on PC. Sometimes only the 5 most recent episodes are available. Same with Netflix. They don't always have the most recent movies (rarely in fact) and they can have licenses pulled like they are recently having issues with with Stargate SG-1.

&gt;&gt;**Duals902** - DVDs offer so much more content wise. Most importantly is special features. (That being said Amazon Prime now offers streaming of certain special features). Also by collecting physical media one can display their collection

&gt;&gt;**TheFatKid4Life** - Why does anyone collect anything really? Personal pleasure and pride of ownership maybe. Nostalgia and a connection to a specific time and/or place possibly. For me, most sites seem to focus their libraries heavily on films from post-1990. Not many offer classics which is what I enjoy most. Finally, very few if any streaming sites offer anything in the way of bonus materials (commentary, deleted scenes, making of, etc).

&gt;What's been the biggest

&gt;&gt;**Charlesp22** - /u/Gigafrost has the biggest collection in one particular genre. But I think that /u/DVDJunky probably has the biggest mixed-genre collection. You can check out his collection by searching for his name in our subreddit. He even color-coded it once and posted it.

&gt;&gt;**Stalked_Like_Corn** - The biggest collection that I am super jealous of is from our Collector and Anime Expert Gigafrost. Dude has a massive collection. This was filmed 8 months ago and he's added a ton since. You can check all his other videos to see all his pickups

&gt;&gt;**Duals902** - I would say /u/Shallowdepths or /u/Gigafrost have the most impressive and biggest collections I have ever seen. Shallowdepths has a huge variety of DVD and Blu-Rays as well as some very collectible items (Im envious of his collection). Gigafrost collects all anime releases he can gets his hands on and I believe is well over 2000 titles IIRC.

&gt;&gt;**TheFatKid4Life** - The biggest and most impressive collection I've seen belongs to Gigafrost. His collection includes over 3500 anime titles and at least 95% of them were purchased new. It's not my favorite genre (don't dislike it though) but I can't help but be impressed by the scope of it. My favorite collection is easy to name: mine. I have access to my collection while I can only look at and appreciate the collections of others.

&gt;What types of films are usually in redditors collections - style/genre? Any particular favorites that seem to pop up a lot?

&gt;&gt;**Charlesp22** - The films that typically show up in collections are like the imdb.com top 250. We will all sort of get on a kick and buy the same movie when it is released like Battle Royale was pretty big

&gt;&gt;**Stalked_Like_Corn** - We get a huge variety of collectors but there are times you notice in peoples pickup posts trends in our collecting. Recently everyone has picked up Ducktales: Treasure of the Lost Lamp. Also when sales are going on like Criterion's you'll see a large influx of Criterions in peoples pickups.

&gt;&gt;**Duals902** - Criterion releases appear to be extremely popular and favorites around the subreddit and appear in our ""Pickup"" posts quite a bit. We also get a lot of anime pickups over on the subreddit. I would say the most common genres are either Comedy or Horror.

&gt;&gt;**TheFatKid4Life** - Members collections vary and that's one of the things that makes DVDCollection great. A few releases that seem to be in most collections are the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, there seems to be a common appreciation of Criterion Collection releases.

&gt;How does one become an expert in DVD collecting?

&gt;&gt;**Charlesp22** - People are usually brought up with movies or they weren't, they keep their ears out for new releases, and they love seeing those types of movies pop up in peoples collections when they get posted. The best experts are the opinionated ones.

&gt;&gt;**Stalked_Like_Corn** - Well, Comedy, Horror's whatever. To the point they know the genre in and out. We get our experts from the community from people who contribute and show real knowledge in a particular genre and an interest in helping people who need help.

&gt;&gt;**Duals902** - One becomes an expert by completing an application process and by being active on the subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**TheFatKid4Life** - We have [guidelines](http://redd.it/vab80) that users can follow to apply for a position as an Expert on the sub

&gt;What have been the hardest cover quizzes? Anything still unsolved?

&gt;&gt;**Charlesp22** - Cover quizzes are solved every day, or even worse.. YOU OWN IT!

&gt;&gt;**Stalked_Like_Corn** - They're almost all hard for me. They're fun however and the ones I like are the tricky ones. /u/alliterativegenius does a great job at them as well as helping run the subreddit.

&gt;&gt;**DUals902** - No quiz has gone unsolved but I do remember one particular quiz in which only a handful of people answered but I cant recall the title. If the quiz is too tough our Quiz Master will give some hints.

&gt;&gt;**TheFatKid4Life** - The hardest for me that I can remember have been [May 13](http://redd.it/tl5fa), and [August 19](http://redd.it/yhwb8) of this year. Nothing goes unsolved because the answers are posted the next day. As a person that guesses daily, I think there would be riots if the answers weren't posted since the precedent has been set. ;)",,False,self,t5_2sgno,,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/zl11p/september_9_2012_rdvdcollection_the_second_best/

**728 conspirators** for **14 days**

...hold on a second

    728 ÷ 14 = 52

Aha! As we all know there are 52 weeks in a year! So far the subreddit has 113 posts! As we know 113 is short for route 113

    Number of posts so far = 113

Let us return to how many mods are running this notorious operation of a subreddit... and multiple it with the number of weeks in a year...

    52 x 2 = 104

This is getting very frightening here folks

Now let us subtract the last two results from one another

    113 - 104 = 9

But at the same time separate the numbers 11 &amp; 3 from 113 and 10 &amp; 4 from 104 and subtract them as well. Do you see where I'm going with this? Do you see the proof is in between the lines?!

    113 = 11 &amp; 3
    104 = 10 &amp; 4

Thus

    11 - 10 = 1
    3 - 4 = -1

Since -1 isn't a real number so it becomes 1. 

    4 - 3 = 1

Put all the results together and you get

    52 = 9/11

...**MY GOD**

This conclusion has only one meaning; these people want to cause terrorist karma attacks all year long! Wake up sheeple! Its right in front of your face! How long will we let these pro-kony-loving e-militants run free while they plan their attacks in their my little ~~pony~~ narwhal bunker cell subreddit. We need to act now and infiltrate them from within. We should go there

Don't believe me? I know I couldn't trust you /r/trees huggers

&gt;##I. Who thought of this master plan? You do consider yourself meta?

&gt;&gt; **Z3F** I came up with it and here's why:
Statistics from a number of international, and the explosion in average daily surfing times that mobile internet browsing has yielded.

&gt;&gt; This results in a deficiency of sorts. Instead of LOLs, 1 gram of high-quality is better than 3 grams of mid-quality. The same applies to posts. While it is not realistic to simply prod the people of the internet for a higher output of high-quality content, a number of remedial solutions have been prototyped and released into the wild. My subreddit is the newest and most powerful yet of these. KarmaConspiracy is in essence just a clever means of 'metafying' pre-existing high-quality content by repackaging it, thereby extracting the remaining dribblings of Karma.

&gt;&gt; Sitting in the control room of this newly-born subreddit machine is exactly where I want to be. Soon

&gt;&gt; **NotANoveltyUser** This was *Supreme Overlord Commander of the imaginary Armies* Z3F's idea

&gt;##II. Karma

&gt;&gt; **Z3F** Undoubtedly more sought after than gold. You don't see people forcing their cats into uncomfortable positions and taking pictures of them for gold

&gt;&gt; **NotANoveltyUser** I have considered spending money to get karma

&gt;##III. Why has the attainment of karma become a thing in your opinion?

&gt;&gt; **Z3F** Karma is just the metric Reddit uses for quantifying 'e-peen' length, loved and respected. They might even convince themselves they have fans and allies. The only solice they have in this unforgiving world is those two figures in the upper-right corner of their profile.

&gt;&gt; **NotANoveltyUser** Socially awkward people seek acceptance and want to know they are funny/smart

&gt;##IV. What is the funniest thing you've seen someone do for karma? Same question but now scariest thing?

&gt;&gt; **Z3F** Too many to choose from. Just take a look at some of the submissions on our subreddit. If you have to have something for this

&gt;&gt; **NotANoveltyUser** Umm.... I don't know. Too much time on Reddit to remember specifics.

&gt;##V. Tell us about your community in your words? What makes them so special.

&gt;&gt; **Z3F** It's the safest and most fun place for the whole family to condition themselves into looking at Reddit through the looking-glass of a paranoid schizophrenic.

&gt;&gt; **NotANoveltyUser** Its a bunch of people coming up with ridiculous theories behind what happened for people to get the pictures they post. It is a giant conspiracy-theorists-circle-jerk. Its great. They are special from the number of times they were dropped on their heads.

&gt;##VI. Anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt; **NotANoveltyUser** Forsooth my whizzle.

For many of us, watch videos, and sometimes go on this silly website called Reddit. While some people have to share a computer, those with a computer of their own tend to be less careful when it comes to the links on their screen.

This gave HimmelFahrt an idea. A fun little game where the people of Reddit post a (hopefully unedited) picture of their current dekstop

I got the chance to talk with Mr. HimmelFahrt

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;**HimmelFahrt:** My job required me to watch many powerpoint presentations. As the speaker would be setting up his/her laptop with the projector

&gt;When did you start moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**HimmelFahrt:** About 1 month ago.

&gt;Do you think that your desktop says a lot about you?

&gt;&gt;**HimmelFahrt:** Yes

&gt;What was the weirdest desktop you have seen?

&gt;&gt;**HimmelFahrt:** When you don't fit into the typical reddit demographic, and I think he took the post down.

&gt;Any famous people's desktops that you would like to see?

&gt;&gt;**HimmelFahrt:** Since we already know a lot about famous people

&gt;Anything you'd like to say to your current subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**HimmelFahrt:** Thanks for playing and keep on sleuthing!

Everyone here has played or watched Pokemon, that would take a ridiclious amount of time, effort and pokeballs. And do not begin about the amount of food you need to buy, and the many shit you need to clean. 

But as I was saying

Here comes /r/PokemonLeagueDS in the picture. The place where they make *that* happen. 

Here is your chance. Your golden ticket to fullfil that dream. The opportunity to actually achieve something in your life! Go take this ticket and run home to tell your parents what a lucky son of a bitch you are

/r/PokemonLeagueDS is [in a nutshell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKMK3XGO27k) a subreddit where you can participate in a champions league with real people

&gt;Yeah we battle strictly through the DS systems. There is no multiplayer set up in game that organizes people into gyms or anything. The multiplayer is just standard 1vs1 matches with your friends
&gt;
&gt; - Tyranitard

I really recommend reading the interview. Everything about the subreddit and how it works is explained there. You will also get pumped to join in!

I had a group chat with the moderators of /r/PokemonLeagueDS

##~~More answers coming soon!~~ All is done!

&gt;#1. How did this subreddit got started?
&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** The League started a little over a year ago. There was not a Pokemon League made for the DS games yet so our OG members made it. It was off to a slow start

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** I talked with one of the founders

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    There was already a /r/PokemonLeague at the time

&gt;&gt; **illsavetheinternets** Me

&gt;&gt; **TheRealQwade** I wasn't one of the main people responsible for starting it

&gt;&gt;    **blaszinski2**    This shredding was started a little over a year ago. Not sure exactly how as I came along right when most gym spots were full and only snagged a spot due to someone else backing out.

&gt;#2. It is clear to me that everyone has a different role in this subreddit. Could you introduce yourself (your part in this subreddit)?
&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** We all participate and help out. That is what makes our community so great. Users and mods all contribute a great amount in keeping this place running and generating new traffic. 
I guess if you had to label me as something it would be the unofficial leader. I have always been the person in my group of friends to get things going. This carried over into this subreddit. /u/ChocolateBowtie would agree

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** I am the owner of this league

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    I’ve been part of this subreddit since its creation. I was the grass gym leader in the beginning. After a big overhaul, I take on challengers and try to defeat them. If they defeat me, they get a badge. As a mod, my job is to pretty much answer the modmail

&gt;&gt; **illsavetheinternets** One of the original founders

&gt;&gt; **TheRealQwade** In addition to being the gym leader of the coolest types (Poison and Bug)

&gt;&gt; **Careful_Houndoom** I am the IRC manager

&gt;&gt;    **blaszinski2**    I was first made a mod due to the ability to bring in new players. There was one night which stood out in particular and that


&gt;#3. What is the main purpose of /r/PokemonLeagueDS?
&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** The main purpose of our League is to give the most accurate experience to the Pokemon League in the games and anime. You face 8 gym leaders, and if you are skilled enough to beat them, then you become the champion of the league. The champion defends their rank to others who may beat the Elite Four. We also host raffles/tournaments quite often for users to win Pokemon and prizes.

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** The main purpose of our league is to be as authentic to the game/anime lore. We have 8 gyms

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    Tyranitard put it very well. I also see it as an extension to the games. After you beat the in-game Elite Four and capture all the legendaries

&gt;&gt; **illsavetheinternets** There was no (active) DS community/league for pokemon around the time and we're here to provide a fun experience.

&gt;&gt; **TheRealQwade** For me, the rest is kind of unfocused and grind heavy. The League gives competitive battlers an outlet to encourage sharpening their battling skills in new and unique challenges. All of our gyms are allowed different formats at the discretion of the leaders. Some are standard single battles, but we do have several gyms that utilize double battles or the even more uncommon rotation battles.

&gt;&gt; **Careful_Houndoom** To encourage people to play and think differently. You'll notice our rules are far different from the normal rules of competitive play

&gt;&gt;    **blaszinski2**    The main purpose of the sub is to give people a place to battle competitively with real people and to have people to bounce team and strategies off of. Everyone helps each other out and were always trying to make each other better players.


&gt;#4. Say
&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** If you want to join the sub you may need to know a little bit about competitive Pokemon battling. There is an awesome community called Smogon that has great information on how the competitive scene works and help with how to build teams. 

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** To actually join the league we have an official rule page featured in our side bar

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    You’ll need to build a team of 8 pokemon
 Knowing about competitive [pokemon](https://www.pokecheck.org/) battles isn’t a requirement


&gt;&gt; **illsavetheinternets** You form a team of 8 pokemon and it is highly recommended you EV train the pokemon. You then level them to 100 or join our IRC and ask someone to help in doing so. PM us mods your friend code and Pokechecks of your team. Once you get an approval you can start challenging leaders.

&gt;&gt; **TheRealQwade** Prepare yourself a team of 8 (yes, you can challenge the Elite Four and become the Champion. We allow challengers to build teams of 8 because of the type-heavy nature of the gyms. If you have a Pokémon you love to use, like Toxicroak, for instance, who really struggles in the sun, you aren't forced to bring it in against our Fire gym. This way we can allow challengers to use Pokémon they really want to use and not force them into simply using the most powerful ones.


&gt;&gt; **Careful_Houndoom** It would behoove anyone interested to be aware of game stats such as IV's, as well as move pools and typing. We have members that can RNG for people, or help level if neither are your forte. After you have a team of 8 set up, upload them to Pokecheck and send a message to the mods for approval to start challenging the League.

&gt;&gt;    **blaszinski2**    If you would like to join the league

&gt;#5. Can you choose any pokemon
&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** Looking to join? Best thing you can do is familiarize yourself with the competitive scene. Easiest ways to do that are by reading through [Smogon](http://www.smogon.com/) or by jumping in our IRC chat and discussing strategies with us.

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** For choosing your pokemon we go by [Smogon](http://www.smogon.com/) OU rules

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    Almost any pokemon. We have a [ban list of Ubers](http://www.smogon.com/bw/tiers/uber) (pokemon that are too powerful. most legendary pokemon are on this list) as well as some abilities.

&gt;&gt; **illsavetheinternets** Just about

&gt;&gt; **TheRealQwade** We have a banlist on some of the most powerful Pokémon to encourage diversity so that not everyone is forced to bring a Mewtwo if they want to succeed. We're currently following [Smogon's standards for banlists](http://www.smogon.com/bw/tiers/uber)

&gt;&gt; **Careful_Houndoom** There is a banlist

&gt;&gt;    **blaszinski2**    You at choose any pokemon as long as it is in the OU their or below.

&gt;#6. In the light of Pokemon
&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** Gengar is a total badass

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** My personal favorite pokemon is Lucario

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    It’s hard to say. There are so many! I have a soft spot for cute electric types like Pikachu. But at the moment

&gt;&gt; **illsavetheinternets** A tough question for me because I have a lot of favorites

&gt;&gt; **TheRealQwade** Wobbuffet by a mile. To anybody that doesn't like it: once you learn to use it


&gt;&gt; **Careful_Houndoom** I hope my username would make it rather obvious that the hellhound

&gt;&gt;    **blaszinski2**    My favorite pokemon type by far is fire. But my favorite pokemon based on looks would be Ninetales

&gt;#7. Do you need to fight the gymleaders alone or in a group

&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** You challenge leaders 1vs1. You battle by using Nintendo DS/3DS systems over wifi. 

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** You fight the gym leaders alone

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    You need to fight the gym leaders alone, and triple/rotation battles (3 pokemon on each side). My gym is a double battles gym. It’s just a personal preference of mine. Double battles go by fast and require different strategies than single battles.


&gt;&gt; **illsavetheinternets** Our gym leaders have their own say on how they are to be battled whether it be doubles/singles/roation

&gt;&gt; **TheRealQwade** Gym leaders can be battled at the challenger's discretion. We don't have a set order or anything because the League happens in real time. We all have lives and jobs and school and whatnot so we're pretty understanding with scheduling issues that come up.

&gt;&gt; **Careful_Houndoom** It's between two players only although each leader gets to set their own rules for the gym to add variety so double

&gt;&gt;    **blaszinski2**    You will fight each leader 1 on 1. 


&gt;#8. Would you consider yourself a Mindy
&gt;&gt; **Tyranitard** Ash sucks. I doubt my beard IRL would allow me to pass as a Misty. I guess I would say Brock

&gt;&gt; **Chocolatebowtie** I'm totally a Misty

&gt;&gt;    **pogpod**    None of the above. I’ve always been a Team Rocket sympathizer.

I have a problem. 

I am addicted to room redesign. Now

I go to people's houses and I think this should be there and that should be here and sometimes I just want to move their whole living room *any way* but how they have it, I really am not OCD, but it does bother me because I really, really want to say something but know *it's not polite to actually act on it.* So I end up  feeling as overstuffed as a sofa and loveseat crammed into a too small corner of a too full room trying to hold it all in.

I once found this great vintage marlboro standing ashtray. It was like a combination between [this one](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/m243f9a2lOVHELmnvpdHPeA.jpg) and [that one](https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKDQNytxVLb_BJuC9XuG91Tavx8h3DhKNkAzW_6qFyW6HjWoO9) but not really. The graphics were totally different. It was orange and red and white, I realized, yeah, it was rude of me to want to redesign **his** apartment. And I realized, if I got him that ashtray (which I think now, I probably would've liked  a lot more than he would) it would be a reminder of how much I disliked the rest of his bad furniture and poorly laid out apartment and only really liked that one thing. It turns out, while it was easy for me to realize immediately I hated his grandma-ish sofa

And so

But now I just found this **great sub.** People who *want* to have people tell them how they might redesign their room! Permission. Finally!

Some people [need more help](http://imgur.com/a/9C8L5) than [others.](http://imgur.com/a/QRSYV#0) There's plenty of space for a [variety of ideas for the same room](http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/z8i83/en_suite_spacious_room_owned_by_tasteless_me/) for the submitter to choose from.

But best of all submitters there really want help

I recently talked with moderators IotaGamer and BarricadeLights and here's what they have to tell us about /r/DesignMyRoom: 

&gt;##1. What made you create this sub?

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** I was browsing /r/AskReddit and came across a post asking if there is any subreddit dedicated to users asking other users to help them arrange their rooms according to their taste. It struck my mind and I made the community. Our only mod

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** This sub began from an AskReddit Post submitted by user /u/PropaneFitness. I happened to be browsing the new section and having already had a strong interest in design related things

&gt;&gt;At that point, so I thought being a moderator would be more interesting. I had never started a subreddit, being a fairly ""new"" redditor myself, however I was happy to help out so I offered my assistance in helping IotaGamer when he posted that he had set up the requested subreddit. 

&gt;##2. Are any of you designers?

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** Nope. I'm not a designer. Well, I design my own room. So that's that. Organizing things really interests me. 

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** I'm not an interior designer

&gt;##3. Do you have any favorite room redesigns or ideas that either you did

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights**  I enjoy those redesigns where we can discuss things with the poster, since our subreddit is so new!

&gt;##4. What would you like people to know about /r/DesignMyRoom?

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** I would like people to know that /r/DesignMyRoom is a subreddit where you can get constructive

&gt;##5. Do you have anything else you would like to add? 

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** First of all

No

Like some of the other new writers here

So some things about me:

* I never
 
* Like a lot of people I like [Mad Men](/r/madmen) and know too much [trivia about it](http://tomfoolery815.tumblr.com/post/23616288239/matthew-weiner-shows-some-love-to-andy-richter-controls).

* Of all the reddit jesuses I am the one that watches over the shittynetwork. Well
 
* And I like Louie C K as much as the next redditor

    &gt;—Algernon Blackwood



&gt;The most merciful thing in the world, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age....

With these words, creatures of all time. Like Poe and his raven, cosmic under-sea terrors belong to Lovecraft alone.

But like many artists, the sub is full of discussions on Lovecraft, his odd oeuvre, the works that inspired him, and the works he inspired.

It is with pride that for today's featured subreddit I say: ""Happy Sunday and Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!""

cthulhufhtagn answered a few questions from our team about /r/Lovecraft:

&gt;Which is your favorite Lovecraft story? Which do you think is the most under-appreciated?

&gt;&gt;My favorite story changes often

&gt;Why does his work still seem so disturbing

&gt;&gt;As for why it's so disturbing...much of his work came from dreams, i.e. Cosmic Horror. It's not the fear of the vampire or the wolfman. Not that Lovecraft doesn't have his monsters...but his monsters are gravitating (mostly) toward this cosmic horror, this greater unknowable horror. His work gets into my skin, and is the only thing I have encountered as an adult that can still spawn the occasional serious nightmare for me. I see that as a positive.

&gt;Which authors would you recommend to fans of Lovecraft?

&gt;&gt;Other authors: Off the top of my head - Chambers' The King In Yellow, W.H. Pugmire. There are also a lot of lesser-known authors and publishers out there churning out great stuff on a regular basis. Innsmouth Free Press comes out with some pretty decent anthologies. Those into RPGs should check out the vast library of Call of Cthulhu resources via Chaosium and others. Not only are they good resources for RPGs, but there are some great stories in there, and period information.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the readers over at /r/Lovecraft?

You like reddit.  Why else would you be here if you didn't?  Except you.  You're just freakish.  Anyway.  Why do you like reddit?  What makes it work?  What makes it *not* work?  That's the kind of stuff that goes on in TheoryOfReddit (ToR).

I had the extreme pleasure (Oh

&gt;##What is your current theory behind reddit and how it works?

&gt;&gt; In a lot of ways Reddit is a result of its own success. Its development over the last several years has been a result of increasing scale. When the site started out, and those solutions sent the site in unexpected directions.

&gt;&gt;So when Reddit started, everyone else voted on that stuff, and the front page arranged it hierarchically to make it easier to find the stuff that the users in general liked. It was, at base, a link aggregator.

&gt;&gt;That worked pretty well for a while. The first problem that cropped up was that, but that, in turn, let to unforeseen consequences.

&gt;&gt;So each of these improvements that the admins have implemented -- subreddits, custom CSS, flair -- each of them starts out as either a small bit of added functionality or a solution to problems of scale. And each one shifts the trajectory of the site. And it's wound up making link aggregation a relatively small part of what Reddit is now. If you look at the 20 default reddits, which are the reddits in which most redditors are most active, about a quarter don't lead off-site at all. Another quarter focuses on content generated by redditors -- they probably wouldn't lead off-site at all if you could upload images directly to Reddit. About another quarter technically encourages off-site links, but is so dominated with text-posts and user-generated content that you'd be forgiven for thinking that they don't.

&gt;&gt;So Reddit is something else these days. At the moment

&gt;##What prompted you to start ToR?

&gt;&gt;Well, political and social systems that arise as a result. So it was virtually inevitable that I'd create something like ToR. And more directly, it was a response to changes that were growing increasingly more prominent at the time.

&gt;##What's the best of and worst of reddit that you've seen based on ToR?

&gt;&gt;Specifically via ToR? That's hard to say. We don't really get the same extremes that you'd find in other parts of Reddit, or why I hated /r/gonewild.

&gt;##You're an incredibly active redditor - mod of many reddits

&gt;&gt;The moderator stuff is pretty easy

&gt;&gt;The most involved moderation I've been involved with is over at /r/RepublicOfReddit

&gt;&gt;As for the rest, and I have a very active mind. So most of it's really just a matter of burning through whatever crops up in front of me.

&gt;##Would you mind telling us a bit about the person behind the mod?

&gt;&gt;There isn't all that much to tell. The big thing, and there are a number of subjects I've been following long term.

&gt;&gt;I don't like giving away too many personal details in the wild west of the internet, for instance, you'd find out pretty quickly that I've got a B.A. in philosophy. And look in just about any AskReddit thread about why people should bother tipping their waiters and you'll learn that I've both waited tables and bar tended in the past.

&gt;&gt;Also

&gt;##What would you like to see more of/less of on reddit?

&gt;&gt;Well

&gt;&gt;The crotchety old-timer part of me (which I've had since I was 2 years old) would like to see less user-generated content. I don't want it to disappear altogether

&gt;&gt;But the biggest thing is that I'd like there to be more links on Reddit that pleasantly surprise me. I've got a pretty well-polished RSS feed

&gt;##What makes ToR work?

&gt;&gt;Beats me. My usual process for creating a new reddit is to think about it for a week or so and wonder if there's really any point in creating it. When I'm finally fed up with that, I keep dwelling on the idea. I didn't really think ToR would catch on, and it's ended up being my second most successful reddit (just ahead of /r/worldevents, but still way behind /r/DepthHub). Apart with coming up with the idea, I don't think there's really anything in particular I've done to make it as active as it is. I guess people just enjoy talking about Reddit.

This weekend, wicked vocabularies and enthusiasm, redditors put Skyrim down momentarily and challenged one another to donate to charity.  They dared each other to upvote the poster's donation amount and to dig deep themselves and join in the fun. They stood up in great numbers and generously gave and the result was Sunday, December 4th, 2011: the Reddit Philanthropy Explosion.

All day long, not just for a day or two!!  Another thing, oh man, just check out this [firstgiving.com donation drive](http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/r-atheism/ratheism) where people are donating in the name of /r/atheism.  Seriously, as of 10:40 pm EST, over $130,000 and over 800 donations on December 4th alone! This is amazing!    

Today, it's all about the interview.  Friends, it is my great pleasure to have as our very special guests, the greatest redditors alive, [tuber](http://www.reddit.com/user/tuber) and [Denny-Crane](http://www.reddit.com/user/Denny-Crane)!   

&gt;What is your personal position on the recent philanthropy explosion currently going on at /r/atheism?

&gt;&gt;tuber: Humanity came out ahead on this one. Reddit saved lives today.

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: The explosion in philanthropy will do a tremendous amount of good in the world. For the time being, we’ve raised more this weekend than in all of last year’s drive, so I revel in the success while recognizing that this is likely not going to be a sea change in content at /r/atheism.

&gt;How do you feel about the organic

&gt;&gt;tuber: I love the energy and unpredictability. Seeing thousands of humans reach consensus and move together is a spectacle of nature. It's beautiful to me in the same way that a flock of birds is.

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: Last year’s drive was very organized, the drive became entirely organic. And not organic in the sense of well-ordered agriculture – more like “instant jungle, just add water.” But, keeping the beneficiaries in mind, clutter on a message board compared to a refugee camp in Chad is the topper to end all toppers in /r/firstworldproblems and would probably result in that subreddit collapsing in on itself like a dying star, such that no other petty grievance could compare.

&gt;Is this something you're good with or is there a more organized charity drive in /r/atheism's future?

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: This weekend has been exhausting, but thankfully I believe this community is capable of being good for goodness sake – up to and including policing ourselves and motivating future efforts.

&gt;The pros are pretty evident

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: I think that some of the conversations would benefit from going off of the /r/atheism front page so that some of the regular conversations can continue as before. /r/atheism serves as real purpose for people who feel cornered by their peer groups (or superiors) as well as a place to vent and commiserate when things turn sour.

&gt;&gt;tuber: The core complaint from users is that so much other content has been displaced by donation threads. the core complaint from admins is that we're overloading reddit's infrastructure. The admins have asked us to refrain from posting upvote donation threads (so that we don't crash reddit) and we're asking users to honor that request.

&gt;What can we attribute this explosion to?

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: Three posts hit the front page of /r/atheism early on Saturday, sometimes legitimately; sometimes not. A third post was skeptix offering to donate $0.50 per upvote – possibly inspired by scragar. (Note: skeptix hit that mark in under an hour and immediately posted a screenshot to verify the donation, unlike some of the troll posts we’ve seen.) In combination, three of the top five or six posts in /r/atheism to kick off the weekend all pointed toward the charity drive, and the community took off from there.

&gt;Doctors Without Borders is featured prominently on your subreddit. Why has this charity been selected in this donation drive?

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: This question is frequently asked, or otherwise), keeping overhead costs low, and doing noble work in desperate parts of the world. These factors are probably why, every time the question of which charity to select for targeting has come up (and it has, multiple times, both in 2010 and 2011), charitable efforts may even be split among other worthy causes. But for now, and typically thankless work of Doctors Without Borders is an exemplary secular charity and one we as a community are proud to support.

&gt;Final word. Anything you'd like to say

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: I’d like to thank skeen and tuber, especially people who have very recently become involved. I have sent PMs to people inviting them to our private planning subreddit, but if I haven’t heard back they may not be on this list. I will say, though, that we have an outstanding organizing committee, and if I may list them by handle in no particular order, they are: Nougat, the_oncoming_storm, Teslalation, patcon

&gt;&gt;tuber: ...and Denny-Crane

&gt;Message or thought for the masses?

&gt;&gt;From Denny-Crane: Do good. Be good. It is its own reward.

You've seen amazing drawings before.  But how would you like to *be* that amazing drawing?  Seriously.  Now you can!  You can help artists in training get practice *and* fulfill your egotistical fantasies of seeing yourself in different media.  It'll be a you-extravaganza.  Not sure what image to post?  First, even if your best friend's a cat (it's okay- it's reddit.  We like the cat folk!).  Here, you can make it happen.  See yourself in different formats.  With that, I give you an interview with /u/ItWillBeMine, one of the mods.

P.S. - anyone want to draw me unicycling?  That'd be awesome.  I'd Facebook the frell out of that.

&gt;How does /r/redditgetsdrawn work?

&gt;&gt;Reddtgetsdrawn is a place where Redditors can submit a photo of themselves or their loved ones, or comic book characters, or even zombified.

&gt;What type of photos should redditors submit?

&gt;&gt;The only hard and fast rule is that the photos have to be of themselves or their loved ones (no ""I think this tulip is beautiful; please draw it"" - requests like that belong in r/drawforme). There are a few ways to increase the chances of being artified, and unusual or interesting-looking people tend to get the most responses.

&gt;Who can contribute to drawings?

&gt;&gt;Anyone can contribute to drawings. I'm a mod and can't draw at ALL, what we see in /r/redditgetsdrawn is serious work by serious artists.

&gt;What've been your favorite drawings?

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure about favorite drawings, /u/Dutty_Mayne, /u/dot_your_eyes, /u/dagdafrench, /u/windurr, /u/Mindle, and /u/notbvhj. There are so many more.

Today we celebrate one of the greatest, ""hey, you're doing a great job, and my goodness someone has been hitting the stairmaster"", it's these guys.

Let's suppose you're exactly like me - handsome, a huge fan of Prince.  See, how are you going to learn all the stuff you don't know?  (And if you are like me, the stuff you don't know could fill a barn!)  Every darn time you ask someone to explain something or teach you something, people automatically get defensive.  ""Why is that handsome person talking to me and making me feel uncomfortable,"" they might say.  I mean, you're all, my knowledge of such and such is below par.  May I ask you a question or two?""  And they're all, scary stuff.

But wait!  There's hope!  /r/mentors is here to [bring the noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBA-xi8WuCU)!  This is the subreddit where it's all need some help, leave some help.  You get involved with this subreddit in two distict ways:  you either ask for assistance learning something or you offer help as a redditor knowledgeable in a specific field.  It's amazing, it works, and I love it!

Here to discuss the ins and the outs of /r/mentors is my new best pal and head mod

&gt;Okay

&gt;&gt;The ultimate goal is to share knowledge. Reddit has an unbelievable amount of talent in such a huge number of areas. We'd love to see more people teaching others to better themselves in career choices

&gt;&gt;After pairing, it's best to discuss the best option for the situation!

&gt;I need clarification

&gt;&gt;As far as I'm aware, then a mix of email and IM has proven successful.

&gt;Let's talk stats. Which do you see more of

&gt;&gt;Posts requesting a mentor far outweigh offers from what I can tell. However there are rarely requests without someone helping out in the comments and perhaps PM communication afterwards. 

&gt;Forget quantity

&gt;&gt;Quality of mentorships is the part I think could be improved the most. I'd love to see people come back after some time and give a summary of how they were helped in a new post. This sort of success story would make a lot of people far more inclined to lend a hand. As it stands

&gt;&gt;My original idea for the subreddit was to have people meet here, or even longp er. However long both parties have to work together and share their knowledge. If any participants have had good experiences and are reading this, I'd love to hear from you!
The feedback of a bad mentor would also be important. I'm sure anyone inclined to help would also welcome constructive criticism in their abilities as a mentor.

&gt;How can we help?

&gt;&gt;As for what SRotD can do, once you feel the partnership has come to a natural close, come back and tell us all about it, and what you've learned!

And its not getting boring.     
Every morning they tingle my toung, and the smell of those juicy and crispy baked slices from heaven reach your nose, sleep goes away immediately.

I've been a [bacon](http://i.imgur.com/F9hEd.jpg) lover since I was just a little boy. When we were having lunch at home 1 out of 3 times we ate [bacon](http://i.imgur.com/jquku.jpg) with eggs. And when my father fried the [bacon](http://i.imgur.com/RfOiQ.jpg)

But my fantasation only lived in the world of [streaky bacon](http://i.imgur.com/3iN1G.jpg)
When browsing through /r/Bacon
But this is only a single part of /r/Bacon. The names says it all


&gt;##1.What was your inspiration to create /r/Bacon?
&gt;&gt;    **iheartbaconsalt**    I really became a bacon fan when BaconSalt showed up on the internet and I wanted to do weird things with their product from snorting it to putting it in Red Bull and Durian Ice Cream. I later met Heather Lauer, so I began to post every bacon thing I found on Reddit to my web site and vice-versa. 

&gt;&gt;    **omfgninja**    I saw a picture here on reddit of the famous bacon square, and there were so many bacon pictures, that I realized that reddit loves bacon, and that there needed to be an /r/bacon. It was a match made in heaven!

&gt;##2.When was your first encounter with bacon?
&gt;&gt;    **iheartbaconsalt**     I remember being 3-4 years old dipping my bacon in a cup of chocolate milk to cool it off. Maybe I was the first to mix bacon and chocolate as early as 1978! Wow! 

&gt;&gt;    **omfgninja**    I can't remember

&gt;##3.What is your favorite bacon recipe?
&gt;&gt;    **iheartbaconsalt**     My favorite bacon recipe is of course just bacon

&gt;&gt;    **omfgninja**    I'm not that great at cooking, pepper-jack and the bacon I just made. Take that sandwich and grill it up in the bacon grease, it's awesome!

&gt;##4.Describe in a few sentences why we all should eat bacon.
&gt;&gt;    **iheartbaconsalt**     Bacon is good for you. You're going to die any way
If your kids won't eat vegetables. Add bacon! It'll turn peas, cabbage, spinach, lima beans, pinto beans, butter beans, green beans and black eyed-peas into a tasty dish! And all those vegetables help cancel out the negatives about death I mentioned a moment ago.

&gt;&gt;    **omfgninja**    I don't think everyone should eat bacon

&gt;##5.How do you think the world would be if bacon was forbidden?
&gt;&gt;    **iheartbaconsalt**     I don't want to think about that world. Shut up! You can shove your bacon-flavored tofu where the sun doesn't shine! 

&gt;&gt;    **omfgninja**    I'm pretty sure anarchy would break loose on the streets and the politicians would declare martial law. Whole countries would crumble under the panic and the majority of the worlds governments would grind to a halt and dissolve overnight. Society as we know it would utterly collapse and humans would revert back to a primitive state of tribalism. You either fight for your bacon

&gt;##6.Do you want to add anything? 
&gt;&gt;    **iheartbaconsalt** 
&gt;&gt;Yes!
1. Wrap everything in bacon. Even your cat!
2. Take pictures.
3....    
4 KARMA!

&gt;&gt;    **omfgninja**    Any food that cannot be made better by adding bacon is probably not a food worth eating.

Ever notice all the cool things you see in science fiction movies? Like [Lightsabers](/r/StarWars) or [teleportors](/r/Startrek)? And you wish they were real? And then you wonder, because we haven't funded it properly. And we haven't funded it properly, because we can't sell the idea to investors who are too short sighted to see the benefits of long term research and development. And thats because most R &amp; D companies can't afford marketing guys. We all know how much /r/Madmen love their hookers &amp; cocaine. Btw Happy birthday Lady Gaga &amp; Julia Stiles.

Today, it was all about science and the [way things worked](http://www.howstuffworks.com/). I remember watching that channel for hours and hours a day. As you may already know where I'm going with this, my favorite tv show on it was called [Beyond 2000.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AUJqy5qorw) /r/Futurology is like that but in subreddit format. Oh and the mods are quote awesome too.

The Future is *now!* But I'm still waiting for my jetpack

**Full Q &amp; A Finally up


&gt; What got you interested in Futurology?
&gt;&gt; I'd say, Science Fiction has been the most modern encompassing and awesome way to create the future. Yet, for me, that just pushes the question back; it implies that we've used crystal balls, oracles, theology, to superstition, in order to comprehend the ongoing causal dynamics of our environment. Essentially

&gt; In your opinion what scientific field are we as humans lacking behind in?
&gt;&gt; One of the first things taught in major philosophical and historical degrees is the philosophical idea of the [specious present](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specious_Present) tesifying that we humans refer to as 'the present' is really an illusion. When people say, we must realize that our minds travel linearly [through time.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronesthesia). Everything we do then, is something that occurs over a duration of time. Essentially, when you wave hello, when you complete a project, when you type a message, it occurs over an interval. [The present is actually an exact near infinitesimal quantity-duration, slice by slice, anticipation, and future migrations of animals. It is an immensely valuable evolutionary talent to look just a little bit over the horizon

&gt; What is your favorite mind blowing post you've seen in /r/Futurology?
&gt;&gt; If this is true, what then is the lens in which to guess and understand the future? One hundred years ago, the answer was, we had none. Nothing. It reminds me of a good post which was a picture of H.G. Wells and his famous essay and challenge to the world, [""Isn’t it plain that we ought to have not simply one or two Professors of Foresight but whole Faculties and Departments of Foresight doing all they can to anticipate and prepare for the consequences of this gathering together... of what were once widely dispersed human relationships?"".](http://i.imgur.com/pj4V3.jpg) Now, however, we have degrees of Foresight at a few universities,000 years. Who will be the first to pilgrimage there?

&gt; Where does /r/Futurology see it self... in the future?
&gt;&gt; We see our exponential growth maybe one day surpassing that of r/history, once-impossible wondrous inventions, or do we see another article on the ancient egyptians? Society is hurtling along at an incredible rate. The majority of people I know, including myself before a few years ago, fail to realize that we, human kind, are [the inheritors of a very long march of technology.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/PPTCountdowntoSingularityLinear.jpg/756px-PPTCountdowntoSingularityLinear.jpg) We are witnessing the acceleration of change beyond the lifespan of generations, or whenever a time, industrialization, what is is the consequences of this speeding up

This goes without saying, I'm such a good listener and I give really good advice.

Back to women giving advice. Yes

""What's that time of the month like?""

I don't know

""If she says no

No means no

Now everyone

&gt;##1. Who does /r/askwomen target? Females asking other females questions or males asking females?

&gt;&gt; **Impudence** The target is mostly twofold: People who have a desire to get a question answered by women and women who are willing to answer those questions.

&gt;&gt; **jhra** I think the target is simply the women (and occasional men) that answer the questions. The questions being asked are oftentimes men but this Reddit in itself caters to who is answering (or that is how I feel with this group).

&gt;&gt; **KristieKrunchBar** Both. Anyone that has questions about or for women. We mostly get questions from men

&gt;##2. Why break from /r/2x?

&gt;&gt; **Impudence** This subreddit came about because of a slew of posts in r/2xc asking the women there how they should approach someone they like

&gt;&gt; **jhra** If I remember in the way back ago

&gt;&gt; **KristieKrunchBar** Personally, so they are more likely to be addressed.

&gt;##3. What do you enjoy post about being a mod?

&gt;&gt; **Impudence** The variety of questions we get in /r/askwomen never fails to amaze me. The topics covered really reach accross the spectrum. But what I really like the most is the community we have. It's very respectful. When I created it

&gt;&gt; **jhra** I mod all over the place. Some are bigger like /r/Firefly or /r/Calgary where it is sometimes difficult to make mod decisions and to keep the flow going on the track that the Reddit was intended. I also mod some small stuff like /r/SlamPoetry where it is a very specific topic and the crowd is tight. 39 Reddit in total on my mod queue and /r/AskWomen is one of my favorites. The people are fantastic and it has been a ton of fun watching this little place grow over the past year or so. Actually

&gt;##4. What are your favorite/least favorite posts?

&gt;&gt; **Impudence** My least favorite posts are ones where the asker comes in with an assumption

&gt;&gt; I honestly don't know if I can pick a favorite. There was one a while back in which a guy was asking about how to best clean his infant daughter. It was adorable and kind of funny. The solution ended up being something along the lines of: ""Don't be so damn cheap with the toilet paper""

&gt;&gt; **jhra** Least - 'Hurr

&gt;&gt; Most - Anything where you can tell that the person asking is on the other end of an internet connection taking notes because he/she is genuinely interested in the answers and the people responding are giving detailed and thought out responses.

&gt;##5. Any last things you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; **Impudence** Thanks for choosing /r/askwomen for subreddit of the day! We've been steadily growing and we're always excited to have new people to answer or ask questions.

&gt;&gt; **jhra** Not really. Thanks for picking us as Subreddit of the day.

Just a little reminder for all the gentlemen out there: genuine questions get genuine responses. Remember that next time you want to talk to one of your gal pals.

They are the ones that take the time to think through issues before acting. And they are the ones we are featuring today. r/Introvert. A place you can be yourself.

***THE INTERVIEW*** 

&gt;1.) How did r/introverts start?
&gt;&gt;You'd have to ask the subreddit's creator

&gt;2.) What can people expect to find in r/introverts
&gt;&gt;Discussions about relationships, and anything really that introverts might be interested in.

&gt;3.) Are you, tell us what it's like. If not, then explain your thoughts on introverted people.
&gt;&gt;Yes, such as at a party, they need time alone to ""recharge.](http://giftedkids.about.com/od/glossary/g/introvert.htm)""


&gt;4.) Anything else about your community people should know?
&gt;&gt;[Introverts make up only about 25-40% of the general population](http://giftedkids.about.com/od/glossary/g/introvert.htm) and they need to limit the amount of socialising they do
Introverts are not necessarily shy


&gt;5.)Would you like to say anything to the subscribers of your community?
&gt;&gt;Many introverts don't realise that other people feel the same way that they do. It can be quite a relief to find that other people share the same outlook on their relationships with people. So if you see a post concerning introversion

* *Some men just want to watch the world burn.*

-writer and activist Elie Wiesel

This quote applies to all of us, societal collapse, or 2 rival subreddits go to war. We all need a little disorder in our lives, and /r/SubredditDrama may help fill that gap. With such a large userbase, with so many diverse communities, there are bound to a few heads to but, and today's Subreddit of the Day is there

The evil genius behind SubredditDrama

&gt;What inspired your creation of /r/SubredditDrama?

&gt;&gt;A couple of months ago, mods ruling based on opinion instead of fact, etc. [In this post about some happenings on /r/ArtisanVideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ju3j5/banned_for_having_an_opinion_on_rartisanvideos/), someone explicitly asked of the existance of a subreddit for subreddit drama. So it was simple, there was a need which I filled for part of the community.

&gt;Does reddit seem to have more drama than other sites you've visited? If so

&gt;&gt;Reddit seems to have the average amount of drama for any given forum-type site. It seems less advertised to me due to how isolated some subreddits can be. The fiasco in [/r/ArtisanVideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanVideos) could have possibly gone unnoticed to the community at large if it weren't for [elessarjd](http://www.reddit.com/user/elessarjd) posting about the happenings himself to [/r/pics](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics). The opposite can be said for frontpage or more populated communities (See the [IAmA takedown fiasco](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ju5cf/goodbye_iama_it_was_fun_while_it_lasted/)) where word will easily spread the most of reddit.


&gt;What's the most scandalous dust-up you've seen on reddit so far?

&gt;&gt;In my year or so on reddit, there was no discussion about this occurance beforehand by any party, mod or user. As far as I can tell, this whole thing pretty much blindsided then entirety of [/r/IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA). It left thousands of users feeling betrayed because its creator thought it right to completely shut it down with no discussion on a community based site.

&gt;What do you hope people take away from your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;I simply wanted to provide the community a place completely centered on the drama and happenings in other subreddits. People love gossip, I had the opportunity to make a community for others to rant and rave about abusive mods and internet fights!

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/SubredditDrama?

The modern dungeon-crawlers of today had to get their roots from somewhere. While some may say Legend of Zelda is the old-school dungeon game, the Roguelike genre captures the true feel of stepping into a dark, mysterious dungeon in search of (insert magic item here).

Here's a fancy example of how a roguelike could be played!

    ###########+#####
    #...............#
    #.@.....r.......#
    #.........~.....#
    #...............#
    #################

    @ = me
    # = wall
    . = floor
    r = a rat
    ~ = a scroll
    + = a door

After I managed to kill that nasty rat, I got answers from two of the mods at r/roguelikes, Hideous and postlogic!

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;**Hideous:** A roguelike is a genre of RPG games - nearly all of them feature turn-based gameplay and permadeath. The name itself comes from the original game which went by the name of '[Rogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(computer_game))' which then inspired many other games and eventually creating the genre. The most famous example is probably [Nethack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethack), is installed by default in many different Linux distros. Don't quote me on that though, I don't use Linux.

&gt;&gt;**postlogic:** Hideous pretty much covered the first point pretty well here.

&gt;What game would be a good start for those new to the genre?

&gt;&gt;**Hideous:**Personally, humour, and 2 very funny and detailed systems not commonly found in other roguelikes (material and limb systems - for example, use a scroll of Change Material to change your Steel Chainmail into a Bacon Chainmail if you're really hungry). If you're willing to part with a small amount of money however, [Dungeons of Dredmor](http://store.steampowered.com/app/98800/) is a fantastic introduction to the genre, with more than a little energy spent on making it a pretty game. It has both graphics and full mouse support, and even more humour than IVAN. Of course, so a more serious one would be [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/).

&gt;&gt;**postlogic:** There's a whole range of roguelikes to get into for the beginner, and has - like Hideous said - pretty hilarious moments. I'd also like to add [Desktop Dungeons](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/) to the list. It's a very casual and fun game, with a very small learning curve. Oh, and [100 Rogues](http://www.100rogues.com/) for iPhone/iPod. Great when on the go!

&gt;How do you like to play; Magic

&gt;&gt;**Hideous:** Honestly? My personal way of playing is picking a random class, as I'm not terribly good at these things anyway, but rather to see what terrible experiments I can perform and what silly things the game still has in store for me. I like to intentionally eat zombie corpses and see what happens (I got leprosy!).

&gt;&gt;**postlogic:** Personally I've usually been sticking to the warrior class, I've been playing around with magic classes, due to the whole ranged combat thing, as well as more depth and strategy when playing.

&gt;What's your least favorite enemy in any roguelike?

&gt;&gt;**Hideous:** Mimics are *pure evil*. You're all ""Fuck yes awesome treasure"" but they're all ""haha no."" and then you're all dead.

&gt;&gt;**postlogic:** Hmm

&gt;The burning question: ASCII or Graphics?

&gt;&gt;**Hideous:** Definitely personal preference. ASCII is great for developers because it allows quicker development and updating often

&gt;&gt;**postlogic:** I'm a fan of well-crafted pixel art in games

&gt;Anything you'd like to say to your already-established community?

&gt;&gt;**Hideous:** Post more things! And pleeeeease message us if your stuff gets stuck in the spam queue because it doesn't seem like most of you do that.

&gt;&gt;**postlogic:** Post things! Comment! Above all

The internet can be a scary place. Viagra knock-offs are a dime a dozen. Internet tough guys take part in Spartan-esque competitions that have no end. Frankly

But don't despair, and reddit gives an ideal platform for them to meet. Today we feature one of reddit's larger karmic marketplaces, /r/favors. Surveys and chargers, art and Steam codes, all can be given, taken, or traded in /r/favors. Although the subreddit has hit a speedbump or two in the past, and what sites like reddit are capable of. Today

The dynamic mod team of /r/favors enthusiastically complied with our [request] for an interview. The wacky results are below!

&gt;Why did you choose to mod /r/favors?

&gt;&gt;Anomander: Klein needed help, and this seemed like a particularly deserving community. 

&gt;&gt;TheDashingPrince: When there were some 'elections' last summer, but I find it immensely satisfying when I can!

&gt;&gt;kleinbl00: Because bored one night at work and surfing /r/new

&gt;&gt;steve93: There were elections

&gt;What is the most difficult task in moderating Favors?

&gt;&gt;Anomander: Saying no to people with a pressing need or moving story, kindness, and helpfulness, we have to suspend all of those sentiments as we make decisions. 

&gt;&gt;TheDashingPrince: See Anomander's response. + redirecting someone to /r/picrequests about every half hour. I'm exaggerating but not much! :P

&gt;&gt;kleinbl00: Being a hardass about nice things in a community where the mob feels entitled to tear your life apart the minute someone somewhere said something about someone else being less than impeccable in a position of power. This is why I no longer moderate /r/favors; I sit at the top of the heap to make sure that everybody knows the people who do moderate do so because of popular mandate and that they have been pre-approved to do the job they choose to do. 

&gt;&gt;steve93: Others answered this betterly than I could

&gt;What's the most generous act you've seen in this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Anomander: We have a user who gives away or was for a while, and we have a dentist who just recently did extensive dental work on a community member, all for free. Those two spring to mind immediately. But I've seen some pretty spectacular ""oh, I just ordered one for you"" situations with computer hardware requests, or people going above and beyond to help someone out. 

&gt;&gt;TheDashingPrince: See Anomander's response

&gt;&gt;kleinbl00: We've had plenty. ""most generous"" is pretty hard to quantify and I don't think it does anyone any good to try.

&gt;&gt;steve93: There are too plenty to choose from

&gt;What's the strangest offer you've seen posted?

&gt;&gt;Anomander: I'm not really sure. Most of them seem a little odd from the header

&gt;&gt;TheDashingPrince: Our offers are usually pretty sane

&gt;What about the strangest request?

&gt;&gt;TheDashingPrince: Usually the really weird ones get kept in the spam filter because they will involve infringing on someone's privacy. For example, is really lonely. Will someone go to her house and give her a hug?"". The guy meant well, I'm sure, but it could have ended badly.

&gt;&gt;kleinbl00: Well, sharp knife, black plastic and your address."" This being the internet, no matter how strange it is there's likely someone who wants something stranger.

&gt;&gt;kleinbl00: The weird ones often get lots of upvotes. They're readily available at http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/top/ . My personal favorite is ""[Request: Female stripping dungeon master for bachelor party of greatness +4""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/gnzd5/request_female_stripping_dungeon_master_for/).

&gt;&gt;steve93: I'm also going to go with the guy who wanted someone in Syria to give someone a hug.

&gt;What's the kindest thing someone has ever done for you?

&gt;&gt;Anomander: A nice lady sent me a t-shirt once. She offered to buy someone in the community a shirt, but wasn't sure if that was an abuse of my position as mod - she sent me one, and picked someone else from the thread as well. It's still one of my favourites. 

&gt;&gt;TheDashingPrince: When my computer died and my copy of windows wouldn't reactivate

&gt;&gt;kleinbl00: In this subreddit? Probably [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/j90i8/concerning_kleinbl00/).

&gt;&gt;steve93: About 4 years ago someone at Digg told me about this place

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Favors?

&gt;&gt;Anomander: Yes

&gt;&gt;TheDashingPrince: On behalf of everyone who's ever received a favour from us, you 'populate' the sub and make it have a bigger 'presence' so that people with something to give are more likely to find someone to give it to! (In the least dirty sounding way possible, of course).

&gt;&gt;kleinbl00: Thanks for being one of the few places on Reddit that remains worth the trouble.

---

Although I have not been an avid follower of professional sports, and yelling for my town's team. One such occasion happened just recently during the 2011 NBA finals. At the time, I was working in Dallas and the NBA Finals, featuring our very own Dallas Mavericks, seemed to be the only thing people talked about. Everywhere you went businesses were playing game footage and ESPN SportCenter seemed to loop indefinitely. 

Fast forward to Game Six

A few hours and perhaps a few cocktails later, filled with crazed Dirk fanboys and Lebron haters. Looking at myself, I didn't understand why I was so worked up about the game. I did not have any money on a certain team to win, I wasn't even fond of the sport or the tournament. I realized it wasn't the game itself that I was excited about, but rather the environment that seemed to pull the competitive spirit out of me. I found myself enjoying the game for what it was: a chance to root for a team who is stacked up against the heavily favored team. Everyone loves an underdog. Everyone. 

Since then, or even watched a game in a crowded, fan filled sports bar, I recommend putting it on your bucket list. It's an experience to be had, and a reasonable amount of fun. 

As this season begins, well-placed, ""ball"" joke. 

But what do real fans think the 2011 season has in store for us? To get a more in-depth analysis

&gt;&gt;In my opinion, practice plays, and develop some chemistry. The plays aren't going to be as finely tuned as we are used to. The shortened season is also going to be a factor, as teams won't have as much times to rest up between games.

&gt;Name what you think was the best and worst trade/player movement that happened in the off-season?
&gt;&gt;There was honestly too much good player movement to choose a clear winner. The biggest deal though was Chris Paul, and the Lakers had to ship him off.

&gt;What big match ups are you looking forward to watch?
&gt;&gt;If you're new to the NBA, but you can't go wrong with any matchup from last year's playoffs, as the teams are out to prove themselves.

&gt;Any new players/rookies we should keep our eyes on?
&gt;&gt;I would say there are three big names this year: Kyrie Irving of the Cavaliers, but hasn't been seen much on the big stage since then, and fans are skeptical, but know he has some talent.

&gt; Anything we need to know about your community r/NBA?
&gt;&gt;We are a passionate fanbase for sure. While we may represent our favorite team's logo, either stuff from today, or flashbacks from the greats of yesterday. We're a diverse bunch, some of us have just started to appreciate basketball, and others have been watching for decades. Either way, r/NBA is always ready to welcome more new fans aboard.

&gt; Anything you want to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt;To our subscribers, and discussion. Even in the heat of the season, we'll have posts about the all-time greats. We have a lot of smart fans too, who really know the game and are happy to break it down for the less experienced. All I can say is keep up the great work! Keeping the r/NBA front page filled with highlights, articles, and new content instead of diluting to the meme's overflowing from the rest of reddit, is what keeps me (and many other addicts) coming back for more!

One that clearly belongs among the elite is the focus of today's Subreddit of the Day.  A mild digression - when trying to get the feel for the room (checking out the talent), every second is just stuffed with jokes, talent &amp; pure entertainment!  You're free to contradict and say AD is not funny to you, that's cool, but you absolutely must respect the effort.  Such a rare and singular occurrence in the entertainment industry.

We could spend all day submitting amusing AD quotes (and I would go toe to toe with anyone!), please comment below stating (1) what got you into the show and (2) your favourite moment(s).

Without wasting any more time

&gt;Please tell us what we'll find at your subreddit and why we should subscribe.

&gt;&gt;Well hey there. We’re over at [/r/ArrestedDevelopment](http://www.reddit.com/r/arresteddevelopment). Y’all should subscribe because there just isn’t enough AD all over reddit already!

&gt;Is it strictly Arrested Development discussion or can we bring up side projects (Michael Cera's thousandth movie

&gt;&gt;We keep it mostly AD related

&gt;Have you heard much A.D. criticism? If so

&gt;&gt;I personally haven’t come across anyone who has disliked AD, inside jokes) made it not palatable for a weekly television show. Maybe a movie?

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;It’s a definite maybe. We’re probably looking at the middle of 2012 before they start casting for those meaty man parts though. That means 2013 before the movie debuts. The AD reddit will hopefully be enough to usstain us until then.

**630** readers for **2 years**.

Karma (pronounced as [karma](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Karma.ogg)) is a digital currency created by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman. It was created in response to their parents telling them that they have to move out and get real jobs. Instead of getting a job, and maybe accidentally, is make other people rich by opening up the karma market to the world. 

Now-a-days almost anyone can get karma. All you have to do is make an account and submit something. A [picture of a pussy](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/rtzac/i_fostered_several_karma_machines_heres_one_of/) or just [pussies](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11w1ze/pussy_riot_band_members_sent_to_remote_prison/), something [Neil deGrasse Tyson said](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/q9eur/neil_degrasse_tyson_on_the_daily_show_with_jon/), something [Neil deGrasse Tyson said](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/)...or something [Neil deGrasse Tyson said](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/mateq/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ama/). Give it a horrible title with little or no context ([it's shit like this _____](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=shit+like+this)), click submit, sit back and watch the karma accrue in your offshore karma account. 

But the question remains: what are we going to do with [all this karma?](http://www.karmawhores.net/) A gentleman

I spoke with /u/Fauster to learn more about how the Karma Store came to be and the kind of services it offers.

&gt;##1. How did /r/KarmaStore come to be?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster /r/KarmaStore was developed by ""top men"" in a grounded aluminum shack inside a warehouse in San Francisco. We soon learned that reddit's founders Alexis Ohanian, a brilliant, but reclusive AI construct), were pulling the strings. The purpose of /r/KarmaStore was to give redditors a way to cash in their karma in case the founders initiated reddit's secret self-destruct protocol. Kn0thing was upset that reddit was pursuing a merger with both twitter and facebook, the infamous redTwitFace project. Spez was ready to destroy reddit because, and I quote: ""Burn them... burn them all."" After 6 sleepless months, /r/KarmaStore arrived in its final form. However, Kn0thing had acquired rather compromising videos of S.I. Newhouse at a Tribecca loft party

&gt;##2. Is it hard running a small business in this economy?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster It's not hard to be in the karma business in a recession. There are 3 things people keep buying when their lives are shit: liquor

&gt;##3. Is it purely digital or do you have any interest in opening a physical store?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster There has been talk of opening a physical store

&gt;##4. What kind of things have you bought with your karma?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster I don't sell my karma, I casually drop my karma stats into debates on reddit, and IRL, to add gravitas, and to let people know that I'm important.

&gt;##5. What kind of things have other people bought with their karma?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster Most people seem to buy sex and drugs with karma. One redditor sold his autistic brother for karma, rather than some creepy basement full of fleshlights, fake swords, and action figures.

&gt;##6. Does the Karma Store ship internationally?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster Karma does ship internationally, and Australia, which are historical exporters of karma.

&gt;##7. Does the Karma Store accept bitcoin?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster Karamstore does accept bitcoin. For legal reasons

&gt;##8. Does the Karma Store do conversions (YouTube views, etc)?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster Karmastore does do conversions with ycombinator, but you can trade the cube root of the number of your facebook friends for karma, and sell that.

&gt;##9. Does the Karma Store have a return policy?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster /r/KarmaStore doesn't have an official return policy since, but only advanced users will be able to find it. Efforts are in place to make karma a formal cryptocurrency. Also, if you have to ask how the karma exchange system works, you can't afford it.

&gt;##10. Do you have anything you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;   /u/Fauster I'd like to add one thing

I was walking past the road one day and i suddenly saw [bumblebee](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/BumblebeeHIRES.jpg/240px-BumblebeeHIRES.jpg) from the transformers sending [Dexter's supercharged robot](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UYjkc78ifDc/UA4opRiJh2I/AAAAAAAABlA/Oi0nsTE2HwE/s400/dexter+robot.jpg) flying across the road. The earth was shaking and i was trying to hide myself through the debris to keep myself safe between those missiles and the guns.  
Then i was suddenly sucked into a vortex and fell into a dark room with only a half open door... there was a dim light from the outside .. on approaching it i saw [Marcus Fenix](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100809194102/deadliestfiction/images/9/9a/Marcus_fenix.jpg) from GoW fighting [Alma](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110208175508/fear/images/8/88/Almaart1.jpg) from F.E.A.R. Marcus was heavily hurt and suddenly alma saw me. I tried running but her eyes left me in horror and my legs wouldn't even move. When i blinked again she was already near my face and i could already feel her [breath on my face](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6o3tf6fep1qllrz5o2_1280.png) .. 

and suddenly i woke up.

How many of you dream of character crossovers ? i.e when one character of a universe is made to meet another character from a different universe .. i know i do.

once i went to the movie

Building Fight between [different mangas](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/029/9/c/Kyuubi_Naruto_vs_Hollow_Ichigo_by_Vardigiil.jpg), Dexter the serial killer vs Jeff the killer, Freddy vs Deadpool and many more are one of my favourite ways of passing times .. there's been many many such daydreaming instances.

/r/charactercrossovers is the sub that utilizes this amazing idea with brilliant posts i found this sub to be really fun! :)

So i sat down with Zero00430 for an exclusive interview ..

&gt;##1. What made you create the sub or what was the inspiration behind it ?
&gt;&gt;**Zero00430:**I have always really enjoyed seeing crossovers between different universes, cartoon, or whatever. Over the last couple of years I noticed that I have been accumulating a folder of pictures that are mostly crossovers, and I finally decided to put them to some use.

&gt;##2. What is your favourite crossover till date and why ?
&gt;&gt;**Zero00430:**There have been a lot that I really loved. The Super Mario Bros + Avengers was a recent favorite. The one that teamed up Popeye and Asterix just seemed to me to be a perfect combination.

&gt;##3. Crossovers are amazing i agree .. if you had a chance to be a part of a crossover as a character what would you like to be and who would you like to meet ?
&gt;&gt;**Zero00430:**I have actually seen my dream crossover already, Quicksilver, Speedy Gonzales, the Road Runner, and Lightning McQueen. Then like a week later I see that some one did it, but with Lightning McQueen or Quicksilver. Close Enough I figured.

&gt;##4. Crossovers are amazing i agree .. if you had a chance to be a part of a crossover as a character what would you like to be and who would you like to meet ?
&gt;&gt;**Zero00430:**I don't really want to be part of a crossover as a character

&gt;##5. Do you have any message for your current and future subscribers ?
&gt;&gt;**Zero00430:**To my current and future subscribers

Thanks a lot everyone and a happy wednesday! :D

It's a long settled debate among Trekkies that the Star Trek television shows rank in the following order from best to worst: *The Next Generation*, *Voyager*, and finally *Enterprise*. So why feature an /r/ dedicated to the second best series from the franchise? Simple: 

There wasn't a subreddit dedicated to /r/TheNextGeneration. (Or at least there wasn't until I nabbed it a few seconds ago for purposes of meta.)

Besides, currently popular television programs like [Community](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/m5szz/november_9_2011_rcommunity_i_liked_it_before_it/) or [True Blood](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/k780w/september_7_2011_rtrueblood_true_dat_yo/). It takes an incredibly brave individual like myself to garner the courage necessary to feature an /r/ dedicated to a program that has been off the air for over a decade.

Hold your applause-- I'm no hero. Okay

Thank you.

Anywho, it did what all good Trek does: created vivid characters like Sisko and ~~Worf~~ Odo; tackled controversial topics like the line between patriots and terrorists; and made us imagine a future where the human race has triumphed over its own shortcomings... yet has to keep triumphing, lest it be set back.

Early today I opened up a secure channel with /r/DeepSpaceNine's moderator

***

&gt;I see you all over reddit! How many subreddits do you mod for

&gt;&gt;**DrJulianBashir**: Well let's see

&gt;&gt;/r/videos

&gt;&gt;/r/technology

&gt;&gt;/r/food

&gt;&gt;/r/cooking

&gt;&gt;/r/howto

&gt;&gt;/r/Conan

&gt;&gt;and a few others. Some of those remaining I created as jokes

&gt;But why is /r/DeepSpaceNine your ""baby?""!?! The people want to know.

&gt;&gt;**DrJulianBashir**: Deep Space Nine itself has a special place in my heart

&gt;You've been a community for almost three years yet you have &lt;1000 subscribers. Why do you think this is?

&gt;&gt;**DrJulianBashir**: Well back when I first joined /r/DeepSpaceNine it had 22 subscribers. This was maybe 5 months or so after I created this account. The creator of /r/DeepSpaceNine, so I tried to inject some life into it by posting some stuff of my own (I think almost all posts had been done by Xondar at that point). Then I asked an admin if I could take the subreddit over, and had my request granted.

&gt;&gt;After that, mentioning it when people said they liked my username (which I still do), and asking Corgana over in /r/StarTrek to link us in the sidebar (I believe someone else suggested doing that last one). As I've done this, the subreddit has grown slowly but pretty much steadily from 22 subscribers to where it is now. I'm pretty sure we'll hit 1000 subscribers sometime soon.

&gt;&gt;After some time, I think) because he was being harassed.

&gt;I don't usually like featuring subreddits that aren't incredibly active

&gt;&gt;**DrJulianBashir**: Yes and no. DS9 as a show has been done for a long time, but new DS9 stuff turns up on the internet all the time. One blog I like to visit is by Doug Drexler, a former production/special effects/etc. guy who worked on DS9 (among many other things). Every once in a while he'll have a new tidbit about Deep Space Nine production to share.

&gt;&gt;Also, pictures, drawings, what-have-you, or just wanting to discuss things about the show. Not only that, there are still new people watching DS9 for the first time. I don't try to control spoilers in my subreddit (because it is an old show), so new people should tread with caution if they don't want anything spoiled

&gt;How would Commander/Captain Sisko beat Captain Picard in a one-on-one duel? (Note: the level of detail you employ to answer this imagined scenario will be used to determine your level of Nerd on a scale of 1-100. Go!)

&gt;&gt;**DrJulianBashir**: Well, and more of a brawler. If it were swords, Picard would win because of his fencing experience and skill. Phasers... I'm not sure, although I will say Sisko seems to have more field combat experience.

&gt;(Note: For taking the question seriously in the first place

&gt;Which episode should a DS9 hater watch? An episode that's so awesome they will immediately fall in love with the show and wail in despair that they ever hated it?
  
&gt;&gt;**DrJulianBashir**: Oh well it really depends on the person. If they're looking to connect on an emotional level, it has a real impact on the viewer, illustrates beautifully the relationship between Sisko and his son, and is just a great story.

&gt;&gt;If it's a more story/intellectual based approach, moral ambiguity, great character study and again great storytelling. If you jumped right to it it would reveal a lot of DS9's series wide plot arc, but it's a damn good episode and definitely one of my favourites.

&gt;Are you the *real* Dr. Julian Bashir?

&gt;&gt;**DrJulianBashir**: Sorry

I tried to think of an awesome introduction for this subreddit

Woah

&gt;I'm glad you both could join us. Could you please tell us a little bit about yourselves?

&gt;&gt;**Slackbeing:** I'm Spanish, blues, jazz, classical and electronic music too. My favourite authors are Fyodor Dostoevsky and Stanislav Lem. I shave once a month or so, when I'm a beardo I look like I'm a 40 year old father and when shaved I look like a 20 year old kid. In between those states, I look like a standard nerd. So versatile.

&gt;&gt;**AtheismFTW:** I'm American.

&gt;How did r/woahdude get started

&gt;&gt;**Slackbeing:** I don't know exactly how it started (I started visiting r/woahdude months after it was created), r/marijuana, r/drugs and similar subreddits, mixed with regular, sober content. It takes from users the hassle of finding interesting links when operating a computer gets increasingly difficult. The subreddit is meant to have very specific content for people with very specific needs. That is, stuff to watch, listen and play with while on drugs that makes you say ""whoa

&gt;&gt;**AtheismFTW:** I created /r/woahdude after I realized that when you're high it can be really hard to navigate the internet and find interesting links to click on. Especially links that are mellow, you might be able to bounce between a couple different subreddits and get bits here and there, but none of them are really specifically crafted to entertain the stoned brain. Well, there are other stoner subreddits, but those tend to deal more with issues like stoner culture or sharing pictures of their weed or pipes. That's cool and all, but not everyone who gets high just wants to sit around talking about what they just smoked or what they smoked it from. Not that there's a problem with that. Diff'rent tokes.

&gt;Do you have a favorite submission thus far?

&gt;&gt;**Slackbeing:** [Blockhead - The music scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vefk5-rvTVM) It's been submitted several times

&gt;&gt;**AtheismFTW:** I know it's gonna sound like a cop out picking one of [my own submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/gihxx/alright_rwoahdude_time_to_close_down_the/)

&gt;&gt;This is just one of those videos you HAVE to watch high. Preferably at night while you're by yourself. With the speakers or headphones cranked up to a high but comfortable volume. And if you have to have the video explained to you

&gt;Any crazy stories you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;**Slackbeing:** Nothing specially crazy, so I removed some of them. Later a user complained they weren't the same, and it was true: it was almost the same course, in the same event, at the same town (Valparaiso, Chile), even starring the same racer, but hell

&gt;&gt;**AtheismFTW:** Crazy stories I'd like to share? How about this one: I don't really even smoke pot. It gives me panic problems. Didn't see that one coming, even when I'm not. I think lots of sober people visit /r/woahdude all the time. It's really a place for anyone. 

&gt;What would you like the future to hold for your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Slackbeing:** More great users, just enjoy it a bit more.

&gt;&gt;**AtheismFTW:** The future never arrives.

&gt;Is there anything else you'd like to say to our audience?

&gt;&gt;**Slackbeing:** Take a ride around here, too.

Nowhere, that's where.

Even meek ole' me got [a 1979 Honda CM400T](http://i.imgur.com/Niea1Kx.jpg) a few weeks ago! Yeah, and even though [my bike's still under construction](http://i.imgur.com/4CfdA1R.jpg), I've had the chance to take her on a short ride and it was the most fun thing ever (until I stupidly dropped her, but that's another story). [Here's a great POV video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqwJWgzC7A8) of a guy riding a bike just like mine, so you can get an idea of what it felt like (hint: it was exhilarating even at old lady driving speeds). 

But even if you can't get a motorcycle right now for whatever reason

And when the day finally comes and [you get your first Honda](http://i.imgur.com/NzPfaGn.jpg)

Seriously, Honda-lovin' family. They don't have any sidebar rules for the sub, just links to resources for Honda owners and a [Google map of the subcribers' locations along with cb750c.com readers'](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=208581944688108102698.0004bf8b711719b9a8dfa&amp;msa=0), and they honestly don't need any. The community is filled with [supportive, kind people](http://www.reddit.com/r/HondaCB/comments/1ea7ws/shes_unofficially_done/) who just want to help others get riding and find riding buddies of their own! 

The sub's mod, not a one received a complaint about users or content or other typical sub-drama, and none of his were about rules or conflict amongst subscribers. It's a refreshing sight to see and one that makes me feel confident in featuring this little sub as today's Subreddit of the Day!

Luckily for us

&gt;#1. What inspired you to create r/HondaCB?

&gt;&gt;**cheetahwilly** I personally love the style and reliability of all the Honda CB's. I have been an avid reader of /r/motorcycles and I noticed a lot of other people on /r/motorcycles also have CB's and they all felt the same as I did. I saw a need to have a separate sub just for Honda CBs because there didn't seem to be anything else available for us in this format. There were a lot of other forums outside of reddit

&gt;#2. Do you own a CB? If so

&gt;&gt;**cheetahwilly** I have owned two CBs now. My current bike is a 1982 CB900c. http://i.imgur.com/pYFyfdh.jpg I have always loved the look of the Honda CBs and there didn't seem to be anything else out there like it. Ever since I was young I have owned Honda

&gt;#3. How do you feel about the [CB Cafe Racer](http://motorbike-search-engine.co.uk/classic_bikes/1975-cb550.jpg) craze?

&gt;&gt;**cheetahwilly** I love the look of the stock CB bikes, to me it is just a different form of art.

&gt;#4. Which model/year of CB is your favorite?

&gt;&gt;**cheetahwilly** It use to be the 1980–1982 CB750c and CB900c. They were very reliable and plentiful which meant it was easy to find parts. Now that Honda has finally came out with a newer CB

&gt;#5. Are owners of other vintage Hondas (CM/CX/GT/etc.) welcome in your sub?

&gt;&gt;**cheetahwilly** Absolutely. I struggled to come up with a good name that would encompass all of these style of Honda bikes, I figured if you liked CM/CX/CL/CD/GL series, you would also like the CBs. To me they are all basically the same style. Maybe I should include a message to let the ""others"" know they are more than welcome here.

&gt;#6. Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**cheetahwilly** I am surprised at how fast this sub has grown in such a short amount of time! Traffic is increasing every month and it seems like it is endless, and I am welcome to anyone who would like to also become a mod. The spam filter catches people almost every day and I try to keep up with approvals. Sometimes it has been a few days before I notice someone stuck in spam. I try my best to keep an eye on it, but I am sorry for those who have been caught up for a while. I hope that it hasn't deterred them from contributing in the future.

Due to some foreseen, number of grains of sand you could fit in a pair of trousers, that sort of thing. Its awesome, I'm subscribed and you should be too. Here's **thetoethumb** to really seal the deal!

&gt;## What was your favourite post so far?

&gt;&gt; I don't think I can narrow it down to one
How much Force can Yoda output? From xkcd's ""What-if""
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?

&gt;## What IRL thing have you always wanted to know the estimation for?

&gt;&gt; ~~Worldwide time wasted on reddit.~~ NO! That would be terrifying. I'd really love to know what would happen if everyone on one side of the world simultaneously jumped from a height of one metre

&gt;## Do you get a lot of posts about woodchucks?

&gt;&gt; Nearly as many as those asking about the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow! For those that are interested

&gt;## How are you different from /r/askscience?

&gt;&gt; As I'm sure we're all aware, but we're just a little more laid back and we focus on making assumptions and calculating answers, rather than searching for answers in literature.
I started the subreddit not long after Aaron Santos' AMA and I found his approach to viewing unusual situations extremely interesting. I guess we're a mix of /r/askscience

&gt;## How drunk do you estimate the admins are?

&gt;&gt; Not sure if I can give you a quantitative answer on that

&gt;## Any final messages for current or future subscribers?

&gt;&gt; Take a guess! We're all about making assumptions then using maths and science to come up with an answer that's ""close enough."" Keep things within the realm of science

A community for **1 year** with **2782 (million)** shitty advisers


Like every redditor that isn't worryingly masochistic, who doesn't? And sometimes we want different things; like when I want to work or study or sleep and the internet wants to play [destructo tank](http://armorgames.com/play/24/indestructotank). But we always compromise, we find a common ground and we work it out. However this once, I have to put my foot down: ""meme"" is not a synonym for ""advice animal"". A picture of a person, animal or sometimes anthropomorphised inanimate object overlaid with two lines of humorous text is not the definition of ""meme"". That is an *advice animal*. A meme is 

&gt;""an idea, which can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena. 
- *wikipedia*


It's basically the cultural equivalent of a gene

Phew! Today's featured sub takes the common advice animal and turns it inside out. It's a deconstruction of the ideas that define our good guy gregs and foul bachelor frogs. Some are [inventive re-imaginings of popular charicters](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pdai5/), real-life lols (so rare!). It is at that great place where the old users are active and practiced and the new users are enthusiasts who want to help create something beautiful (and not just make the most noise in the noisiest room) so when you go there thread carefully and try not to disturb the fragile natural balance of this precious internet ecosystem. Dont ruin it with your mucky boots!

Thanks to Hansafan and Daskoon for answering my stupid questions. And props to Lord_Bumberchute

&gt;## How do you feel about regular advice animals

&gt;&gt; **Hansafan** I have a rather ambivalent relationship with memes. Some are great, I've long since given up on f7u12, still subbed, but I don't browse it. So much garbage... At least in SAA you know what you get. :P

&gt;&gt; **daskoon** If the regular advice animals are the mother of this sub, or love giving shitty advice via animals.

&gt;## Who is your favourite advice animal?

&gt;&gt; **Hansafan** I like socially awkward penguin

&gt;&gt; **daskoon** My favorite advice animal would have to be a shitty one, that fucks up sometimes because she's new. The advice from her just flows like so much period blood on a heavy week.

&gt;## If you could erase one thing off the internet forever

&gt;&gt; **Hansafan** Huh. Tough one.

&gt;&gt; **Daskoon** If I could erase one this from the Internet forever, sounds like a cop out, but well, that shit's just not right on so many levels. Being a father of a little girl, I couldn't imagine my baby being abused that way. Oh, also DRM! Fucking Diablo 3 kicked me out of my single player game because I was AFK for like 10 minutes. bastards.

My professor is full of shit. Sorry to say it Doc, as I type this, he’s trying to explain to the class how global warming doesn’t exist. And before that, he was trying to tell me, a person with Indian roots, that most parts of India are like how they are portrayed in Slumdog Millionaire. [Then he proceeded to talk about how the cast system is the most prevalent part of Indian culture and then asked me if my parents would disown me if I married outside of my cast system](http://i.imgur.com/WCSgi.png).

News flash

Now that you all know what I’m doing during my journalism duties

“A koala with a devilish look in his eyes while he has a red arrow stuck in his knee cap”

That was the first thing I had to draw when I found www.doodleordie.com.

“What the fuck?” I thought. Needless to say

Remember that game “Telephone” we all used to play in elementary school? It was all fun and games until someone fucked it up by whispering

Well, and pass it on. Someone guesses the drawing, and his/her description is given to someone else to draw. I don’t want to sound like a badass, but shit gets pretty intense. My latest thread started with “unwanted veloceraptor” and is currently on “Bill O’Reilly doing it live”. Somewhere in the middle, I got a picture to which I described as “A koala dressed as a hobo that hates dinosaurs”.

It really is a fun time waster. Especially when you’re bored at work or class

The neat thing about /r/doodleordie is that the actual developers of www.doodleordie.com are some of the mods. Today

&gt;##1. What is the inspiration of doodleordie.com?

&gt;&gt; **heyitsgarrett** Dylan (nodecore) had the original idea to port the old ""Telephone"" concept to the web and Aaron (zugwalt) joined him in a weekend-long competition (nodeknockout.com) to build it. In only 8 hours
Shortly afterwards I joined along with Dan to flesh out the game


&gt;##2. What did you expect would come out of doodleordie.com and were your expectations met?

&gt;&gt; **heyitsgarrett** None of us really knew what to expect


&gt;##3. To the mods of /r/doodleordie: Who's idea was it to start the sub and why?

&gt;&gt; **heyitsgarrett** MIDItheKID and hoodatninja started this subreddit after the game went viral on Reddit and kindly invited the rest of us devs to join as moderators. I know they started it so folks could have an easy way to share the hilarity and it's since grown to include these screenshots as well as bits of discussion about features and the game itself.

&gt;&gt;**MIDItheKID** I saw a thread on reddit asking what people's favorite time wasters and games were on the internet. Somebody brought up doodle or die, we made doodle or die, can we be mods?"" and I said ""absolutely"". I give the devs all the credit. I just wanted to see other peoples hilarious chains.


&gt;##4. When did you realize that some of the devs were actually redditors?

&gt;&gt; **heyitsgarrett** I believe they knew early on when we started participating in the discussions

&gt;&gt;**MIDItheKID** 



&gt;##5. What do you have to say to your fans?

&gt;&gt; **heyitsgarrett** We love you guys! Doodle or Die would not be as much fun were it not for the very talented




&gt;##6. Any last words before I finish ~~[you]( http://i.imgur.com/Z1brv.jpg)~~ the interview?

If I worked in a video rental store, ask me about action movies, horror, dramas, I'll rattle off dozens of great ""[must see]
(http://fuckyeahtomcruisesass.tumblr.com/)'s"".  But look, be prepared to hear my speech about how humour is totally subjective.  Case in point?  Five words... *Two and [a](http://gaystoners.com/celeb-stoners/ashton-kutchers-sweet-naked-ass/) Half Men.*  

Even with such gimmies as *There's Some[thing](http://www.amazon.com/Stiller-Autographed-Signed-Photo-Reprint/dp/images/B001J2O7C0) About Mary*, there will always be a group of viewers that'll tell you how it wasn't ""their type of humour"".  And that's cool, but if you don't have anything nice to say, just move to Florida!

Such is the case with the topic of today's featured subreddit - It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Sunny, (that I'd never recommend to my parents).  What I will recommend, however, is today's Subreddit of the Day, [/r/IASIP](/r/IASIP)!  If you're a fan of the show, you simply must head on over, dig through the incredibly interesting posts, and soon-to-be-fans of the show meet to discuss episodes

What's this?  Not yet a fan of the show?!  Do yourself a favour an get your hands on a copy of Season One.  Hopefully

Today's interview is an interesting one.  Normally we contact the moderators of our featured subreddits and interview them.  hero0fwar did something very clever... he put the interview questions to the members of the community and the following is a compilation of replies to the interview questions.

[Thanks for joining us!](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/danny-devitos-naked-always-sunny-in-philadelphia)


##I assume /r/IASIP is about the show. Is there anything else that goes on at your subreddit? What'll we find there? 

You'll find discussion about new episodes and a lot of jokes and references to old episodes. 

You'll find info about webisodes that lots of people do not see usually. 

 IASIP is a very clever show that doesn't receive much attention or support. Having said that, or interesting little known facts about the show

---

##Have you ever found yourself having to explain what the show is about? Seriously

All that the main characters do is sit in the bar drinking and rambling about something or go have an ""adventure"" somewhere messing up somebody else's day. At the end of the day they end up at the bar doing what they do best

The show is about 5 despicable individuals you love to hate who happen to own a bar. The show follows their stupidity to levels you never thought possible
watch any episode from the 1st season

---

##Alright. Please give us some ""Did you know's""... little known facts about the show that'll blow our tiny minds.

Charlie is married to the Waitress -Dee and Mac are married. -Dennis is married to the pharmacy tech from the Dennis system episode. 
the show is the result of Rob McElhenney failing as an actor

Mac actually gained 50 lbs for season 7 

Did you know that the weird sounds they make during the end credits have hidden messages? Those sounds

Mac went to one of the best High Schools in Philadelphia, he must have been like the only one from his class, but he did live at Fordham for a while with friends. Danny Devito isn't in the first season, he was added at the suggestion of the network. Mac was in a hilarious anti-smoking ad before the show. Dee was on Curb Your Enthusiasm. Cricket is married to Emily Deschanel (Bones) and is a producer. Mac gained the weight to challenge the sitcom norm of the cast getting more attractive as the seasons progress

---

##The show is unique in it's approach

Archer, Seinfeld

---

##What does IASIP add to the human condition; to our existence?

Schadenfreude is a hell of a drug. Everyone wants to relive moments when they were able to be stupid

---

##Please share your top three IASIP moments.

Friday night confessional... Forgive me Father

I'm looking at you, we all do... some stuff just brings out the primal urges in us.  What does it for me?  Never thought you'd ask, alright here's my list...

1.  Ladies with shiny hair who use teh mango conditioner.  That's a bell ringer right there.

2.  The smell of clean laundry &amp; fabric softener.  Brief digression, (b) how her mom got her clothes smelling so good.  It ended poorly, but that's water under under the bridge, right?  I should call.

3.  A clean house / apartment.  Oooh that's aaaaah gamechanger!

4.  Spaghetti carbonara.  Gives me such impure thoughts.

5.  And of course

I can't help it, could it affect me even more so than birthday cleavage?  Let's go to John Madden for analysis...  (Picture a fat white man with cholesterol issues and E.D. saying this.)  ""It's much more acceptable to stare at 10 hot laquered nails than it is to stare at some 2 double d's!  You can have a conversation with someone and not take your eyes off their nails, compliment their nails, reach out and touch them gently, even possibly kiss the hand they belong to (should you be a Southern gentleman).   When's the last time you did this with someone with great boobs?""  You can tell us after the hearing, we'll wait.

Today we celebrate... no, lots of comments and upvotes like everyone was smokin' the ganj!  I love the energy of this place, the love, the friendships &amp; support, ugahadshkfalj  Oh, this is embarassing.

Number 6.  Good active subreddits.  Make me horny as a male rabbit home from the war.

Here to give us the low down, the red hot laquer lady herself, *teatoly*!  Yahoo!!

&gt;Please explain /r/RedditLaqueristas. What will we find there?

&gt;&gt;RedditLaqueristas (forgive the misspelling :) ) is a place where a ton of creative energy flows. We show off our nail art creations, poor manufacturing and share stories about the woes of nail art. It's an incredibly helpful and welcoming place for beginners as well as being a safe place for honest opinions. There's no downvoting, as I wanted to encourage constructive criticism, and the community expressed a desire to see it done away with. You can also find tutorials and great helpful inks in the sidebar.

&gt;How did this subreddit begin?

&gt;&gt;I started it after I noticed a niche that was begging to be filled. I had recently begun obsessing over nail art and wanted to share my passion on my favorite site. I got incredibly lucky through word of mouth at 2XC and found the subscriber numbers climbing daily.

&gt;Please tell us a bit about yourself! 

&gt;&gt;I am a pretty laid-back person with a lot of passion and creativity. I enjoy expressing myself through my art and am constantly striving to improve myself through creative expression. I am too critical sometimes of the things I create

&gt;How about your community? Who's posting

&gt;&gt;My posters are amazing. They are honest, which I appreciate. I welcome criticism in the subreddit, a discerning eye is extremely important in respect to art. However, I do try to encourage new nail artists and keep them feeling energized to constantly improve.

&gt;What about the creepos. Do you get many creeps or trolls?

&gt;&gt;I do get a few posters who are critical of some posters not cleaning up the nail art and are dismayed by not having downvoting in the subreddit which I understand. However

&gt;What's your three favourite things about modding for /r/RedditLaqueristas?

&gt;&gt;I love molding this subreddit because it's constantly changing and evolving. I have come so far as a mod since starting it, make people feel welcome and giving me a critical eye into how the subreddit should be run. So my three favorite things about molding is that it's evolving, welcoming, and honest.

It’s no secret that Reddit has an infestation of 90s kids.  Fastest way to find them is to ask them how long ago the 90s were.  If the answer is “ten years, are their cartoons.  Sure, they can be defensive of their Nick shows and their TGIF lineups, but speak badly of a beloved 90s cartoon and you will meet the wrath of a generation.

Everyone has a favorite 90s cartoon, son](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roVCrdBGc9Q).  But I have lots of other favorites, which includes all the ones everybody says is their favorite, so I’m just going to mention ones that only 90s kids who spent part of their childhood in the 80s will know.  *[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtURoWuzfpE)*, *[Beetlejuice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk_vvQ4uq_o)*, *[Back to the Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISVSVBf7GGw)*, and *[Little Shop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIqjFAM5W9o)* are among my favorites from when I was truly a child.  They’re also all based on movies – that was a trademark of early 90s cartoons.  I mean

/r/90scartoons is the subreddit you want to hang out at and talk cartoons.  Did you just get that *Rocko’s Modern Life* joke you missed as a kid? /r/90scartoons.  You vaguely remember growing up with a cartoon five space aliens crashed their ship and live in a creepy house?  Ask /r/90scartoons.  (And that particular cartoon is *[Space Goofs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8m0Rqsn0vU)*

After a marathon of all 24 episodes of /r/freakazoid, I was going to do this interview as [Freakazette](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080731180925/kidswb/images/9/92/Freakazette.jpg).  Who cares that she’s a character that was never formally introduced and therefore technically doesn’t exist?  [That’s like thinking you have to give up meat to be married!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Z9cjKkqn4)  So, I sat down with the mods of /r/90scartoons and prayed for their souls that they could keep up with me.

&gt;#1. Why 90s cartoons?  I mean the decade

&gt;&gt;**FearofPunctuation** I was born in the 80s so I started /r/80scartoons first as a place where I could link multiple series so I could easily watch them. The two main questions I was asked were ""Any Cheetara nudes?"" and ""Can you start a subreddit for 90scartoons?"" I have yet to deliver Cheetara nudes.

&gt;#2. Think about your favorite cartoon.  Now, and Wolverine from *X-Men*.  I don’t know why they’re all on the same team, either – they drew straws or something.  Now, is your favorite character fighting by your side, or are you going to upgrade?  Why or why not?

&gt;&gt;**FearofPunctuation** The Tick

&gt;#3. What is the most underrated 90s cartoon?  Yeah

&gt;&gt;**FearofPunctuation** I guess the easy answer would be The Tick but I think Rocko's Modern Life was ahead of its time. Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network were producing great cartoons that if you go back and watch you will find plenty of inside jokes for adults. Rocko's pushed the envelope to just this side of Fritz the Cat and had brilliant writing

&gt;#4. The world is ending tomorrow night!  Unless one of the many 90s cartoon superheroes can save us.  Without even knowing what the danger is

&gt;&gt;**FearofPunctuation** Jean Grey in Phoenix form of the X-Men. She's the most powerful mutant in the world and is in my opinion the ultimate badass cartoon female.

&gt;#5. Sally has 9 apples.  Jake has 11 apples.  Sally is greedy and eats 3 of Jake’s apples and 2 of her own.  So greedy

&gt;&gt;**FearofPunctuation** I am big into cartoon adaptations of comics in the 90s. The Tick, plus it was the first appearance ever of Harley Quinn. As for my favorite episode of the Tick that would most likely be [That Mustache Feeling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUh--z5_ryg&amp;feature=player_embedded). I could never fully do it justice in describing it but the gist is that The Tick wakes up with a new mustache which turns out to be a government secret weapon that escaped from a lab and sought refuge on The Tick's face.

&gt;#6. You’ve heard of Candlejack

&gt;&gt;**FearofPunctuation** I'm not afraid of Candlejack

Small subreddits? Got some history, three cups /r/proper, a teaspoon of /r/subredditdrama, and a pinch of /r/buildapc ('cause these guys are as nice as those guys).  Without any hyperbole, *this is the community I'm most proud to present as a Subreddit of the Day since we started 12 months ago!* 

Look, in lieu of an interview it is my honour to present two of reddit's finest individuals and moderators of /r/DuelingCorner, Snake_Byte and bamb00zled.  They have kindly taken the time to fully explain what goes on in their community.  

****
**/r/DuelingCorner as presented by [Snake_Byte](http://www.reddit.com/user/Snake_Byte)**

The Distinguished Dueling Corner adheres to the noble sport of orderly combat in arms and the gentlemanly resolution of disagreement as befits those of honourable conviction and refined disposition. Ad honorem, thus one goes to the stars"".

The medium by which we communicate is one rife with diverse opinion and cruel slights. We urge those disputants both to settle their quarrel as gentlefolk ought and to make use of our pleasant venue for their reconciliation.

The means to such decisive settlement vary and our activities as an amiable community vary too. We are home to Grand Dueling Tournaments whereby a winner is crowned Grand Duelist above all, with blunderbusses, with sabres, with greatswords, cannons of lead shot and cannon balls.

Those who instigate a duel will declare formally their intention thus:
""I, for the offense of _______________."" ))

A PM will then be sent by an esteemed moderator, the duel may be conducted with two flintlock pistols, or the challenged party may opt for a blunderbuss against the pistol of the challenger.

Our duels are decided by a refereeing moderator who will post imgur images of the results of a roll of two dice. A round of combat will consist of a dice roll for each participant. The total of the dice roll may result in a miss, a total of 9 or 10 for a hit to the body and a total of 11 or 12 for a fatal hit.

Blunderbusses and Two-Handed Great Swords; more powerful yet more unwieldy

Cannons are a rare occurrence

Now, or two hits to the body or a fatal hit which may have hit the head or heart.

Should you fall you are not consigned to an eternal slumber. A day or two will pass as your are stretchered away and seen to by our miracle-working medical practitioners. Upon regaining your health you are welcome to duel once more.

There remain other subtle rules and stipulations but those are our overarching practices.
All in all, much more. A community of sporting, honorable and jovial sophisticates, eager to test mettle and uphold glory!

Be on your guard! We hope you'll join us soon.

**/r/DuelingCorner as presented by moderator and creator

The Distinguished Dueling Corner is a small club formed on the Estate of St. Elsworth. A discerning group of people frequent the grounds. It is a place where individuals partake in duels – whether with flintlock or blade weapons. Our emblem is “Ad honorem, thus you shall go to the stars"". We speak rather verbosely, imitating the way that those in the Victorian Era spoke when instigating duels. We would hope that those who visit would maintain their manner as befitting of gentlefolk. If you don’t know what I mean, stop by r/proper for a better understanding.

Individual duels are declared for any number of reasons, to ensure that they know of the challenge. To determine the winner, a moderator will roll two 6-sided dice on random.org for each contestant per round, then take screenshots and post them in an imgur account (we post them to both verify that they were taken recently, because of the time stamp, and to ensure accuracy).

The weapon odds are grouped into two main categories: the more accurate weapons (pistols and sabers) and the more cumbersome but powerful weapons (blunderbusses and two-handed great swords). We also have cannons for special occasions. For the specific odds of each weapon, we have a Rifleman’s tournament, where contestants compete in target shooting.

Though the odds are different, two hits to the body, or one fatal hit (the highest numbers are fatal hits, differing by weapon).

We have had several tournaments, the battle of the Colonnade, and the Rifleman’s tournament. It started with just two contestants and two pistols. But we have become much, much more. A community of sporting, honorable and jovial sophisticates, eager to test mettle and uphold glory! Be on your guard! We hope you'll join us soon.

Good day.

It's something that almost everyone can do and has done before: singing. Whether it's in the shower, the people who manage to take an ability that everybody has and absolutely master it. It's mind boggling to witness these people take such a mundane thing and turn it into absolutely beautiful music. 

Unfortunately, there is /r/singing.

What impresses me most about /r/singing isn't the fact that so many talented redditors are willing to put themselves out there by posting videos and audio tracks of themselves. What *does* impress me most is the fact that this community isn't really about showing off so much as being a place of *learning* and *mastering* this particular skill. Its [community's FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/singing) and many informative critiques are all about understanding the nuances of this art. Spend any amount of time here and you'll be blown away not *only* by the beautiful voices but by the beautiful and insightful comments that turn up in the threads as a result. One can just imagine seeing an *American Idol* contestant someday giving a shout out to reddit in general

Last year I met with /r/singing mods afrael and BlackTheta to conduct an interview. To my utter disappointment they didn't answer my questions in song

***

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: We do have some harsh critics

&gt;&gt;**BlackTheta**: People who post critiques are usually very nice

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: Yeah, the next there will be a critique request for an Opera piece, and both are taken equally serious :).

&gt;After spending some time on your subreddit I couldn't believe how many talented singers we have on this site. Tell the truth: you hire ringers

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: OH SHUCKS you got us... 

&gt;&gt;**BlackTheta**: &lt;_&lt; (You said you wouldn't say anything about that) 

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: Heh, huh?

&gt;You've been a community for nearly two years now. In that time, how did you address said controversy in your role as moderators?

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: When the subreddit was about 6 months old, it was all ok again. Not very exciting, I know. We've had a very slow growth and enough people take singing seriously for the subreddit to stay fairly quiet on the drama front :). 

&gt;&gt;**BlackTheta**: Funny story, maybe like a month ago now. I don't have many stories but I guess the only thing that came close was I was arguing with this guy about how low a bass should be able to sing and still be considered a bass, we had two different ideas and then we both clarified what we meant and it was all just a big misunderstanding. So I guess no not really haha. 

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: Usually disagreements are solved in the way BlackTheta solved his

&gt;We all claim to love our children equally but you can be honest here: you have a favorite post and/or submission. What is it

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: Not really a favorite, there can be issues to defeat that have very direct effects on your voice. That thread also shows that a poster who interacts with commenters gets a lot more information out of their post, so we try to encourage that in the subreddit. Apart from that thread I generally enjoy the threads where people post again after a few months and ask for feedback on their progress. It's always awesome to see people get better and better :).

&gt;What do you think your greatest achievement has been so far as a community? Alternatively

&gt;&gt;**BlackTheta**: I think the greatest achievement is the fact that in a hobby that is so largely surrounded by jealousy and spite for one another

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: I totally agree with BlackTheta on the achievement, and you get pretty far just fiddling with the dials and see what happens :D. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!

&gt;If end up falling in love with a complete stranger after hearing only her voice on your subreddit

&gt;&gt;**BlackTheta**: Of course! But then get ready for some awesome Karaoke afterwards! 

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: Whether I'll be there or not

&gt;That's all well and good

&gt;&gt;**BlackTheta**: Well

&gt;&gt;**afrael**: The faq is absolutely wonderful for the basics, so good luck and have fun! :D.

Redditors have created playlists for all occasions... birth of your first illegitimate child, pinching songs,  it's all there!  Here's why you'll enjoy /r/groovesharkplaylists:  amazing collections of songs submitted by redditors, a very, very easy interface (which you'll see if you head on over there), a really great community to help you should you have questions.

I could go on for days, creator, moderator, bullfighter.

&gt;Hey there phoephus2, please explain what we'll find at your site.

&gt;&gt;Playlists from Grooveshark. Grooveshark is an online music search engine where you can play individual songs and compile them into playlists.  A few months ago the good people at grooveshark created a widget for Reddit so now you can play playlists on the r/groovesharkplaylists page without having to navigate to the Grooveshark site. This has made the subreddit exponentially more usable and fun.

&gt;One year old? Congratulations! Tell us how you got started and what life's been like these past 12 months.

&gt;&gt;Thank you. I think it all started because there would these threads in r/music like""what's your favorite beach song"" and everybody would have all these great suggestions. I would compile them as a playlist for my own enjoyment but there was no proper forum to share this list with others.

&gt;What are three things you're most proud of as a mod

&gt;&gt;I'm proud of my co-mods

&gt;&gt;I would like to figure out a way to feature some of the older great playlists that people may have missed the first time around.

&gt;That IS a good idea.  What's the future for /r/groovesharkplaylists?

&gt;&gt;I think one improvement I'd like to see from Grooveshark would be a way for multiple users to collaborate on building playlists. Not sure if it's possible but that would be cool.

(Writer's block strikes again. Stay tuned for an intro paragraph.)

&gt; So
&gt;&gt; /r/Playdate was inspired by gamers who wanted to play multiplayer games that were dead, however, was that people wanted to not only get together and play unpopular games, but also play popular games with their fellow redditors. So, long story short, we're about getting redditors to play all different types of games together.

&gt; What are a few examples of games played
&gt;&gt; Well, and an old school favorite called Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. Recently we've even tried to revive some Source mods like Eternal Silence.

&gt; How many Redditors usually turn out for game night?
&gt;&gt; This really depends on the game and the night (weekend or not). We get different players throughout the entirety of the day as people log on and off based on their different time zones and schedules

&gt; What has been the original communities' reactions to sudden masses of people playing all at once?
&gt;&gt; To answer that question, however, we've seen some flame wars as to what games are too popular for a Playdate, but the moderator team and I make sure that all types of games get an equal chance at getting played.

&gt; I mean the people who still played the games,000 people all from Reddit.
&gt;&gt; Regulars of these dead games are definitely surprised but more importantly excited. The best example of such a case in my experience is during our Subvein playdate. Subvein is a pretty dead game

&gt; Is there ever any server overload?
&gt;&gt; I think we've had a few cases during which our dedicated reddit servers were either full or down

Hello loyal readers! Bear with me here. The very concept of a news aggregator is lazy: It collects articles and anecdotes so one doesn't have to find that material by oneself. And this subreddit serves as an aggregator for the aggregator! :/ I can't make any judgements. (I've become quite taken with wearing tissue boxes for shoes. So functional for the modern shut-in!)

With all this laziness abound on this site, so I'll let the creator and top mod, Wordslinger1919, speak for the subreddit! (We ~~intimidated~~ motivated him into a conversation with us. Enjoy!)

&gt;What started /r/GetMotivated? What are the goals?

&gt;&gt;I started this subreddit after I had been a redditor for a few months. It was the first one I'd created and the most successful, bummed out. Stagnant. Bored with life or worse, felt defeated by it. I was in the midst of a particularly motivating whirlwind and decided that I could help people and that as it grew, we could all help each other, which would be the goal. We pick each other and keep each other on our feet. We're a wolfpack of 17K+ and it's good.

&gt;What sort of posts does one find at /r/GetMotivated?

&gt;&gt;What I've found that that subreddit is very good at is quick bursts of motivation that (can) blossom into life changing habits. I know that if I'm feeling down or bored or lazy, if you let it, be a catalyst and that's what we're going for here. It's not the end-all, be-all but provides a sometimes-not-so-gentle push.

&gt;&gt;There are a lot of fantastic self posts there. Some wolves have written some seriously impressive ""manifestos, the best submissions by far are the self posts, whether they're updates on how much ass one has kicked recently or how they need help finding the motivation to kick said asses. The self posts are always the best.

&gt;&gt;(I haven't even told my fellow wolf mods and who knows if they've noticed or not but I recently went through the Top 200 submissions and added those who made great self posts as Approved Submitters. Think of them as Alpha Wolves. Or something.)

&gt;How has this subreddit improved you?

&gt;&gt;Personally, I created the damn thing. If I can't be a force for good, then what good am I? There've been times, admittedly, when I've felt like a phony, running this subreddit full of awesome people when I've been less than productive or motivated. But that sinking feeling is usually fleeting. Basically, it kind of makes me feel competitive. It's not a race or anything but sometimes, it feels like one. And that makes me work harder too.

&gt;What's the best thing to happen in this subreddit so far?

&gt;&gt;The best thing(s) to happen in that subreddit is when people come back with their Success Stories. I'll show some examples.

&gt;&gt;[This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/jgy83/brutal_august_update_day_12/) has been doing Brutal August

&gt;&gt;[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/jgfcy/im_428lbs_was_470_at_my_highest_what_was_your/) was a very recent submission that perfectly encapsulated the point of the subreddit. It's self-improvement no matter the situation. I mean, /r/GM.

&gt;&gt;Now to be real

&gt;&gt;Those things

&gt;What basic tips/advice do you have for self-motivating?

&gt;&gt;Things that I do: Make your damn bed. It's amazing how much this makes me feel good about myself. It shows that I deserve to live in a clean, very clean. Keeping a clean environment frees up mental space for you to think about the things that really matter. Also, do it now. Whatever it is that you were gonna do, drop everything and just do it. The feeling of relief is immediate is immediate and tangible. Also, surround yourself with good people that lift you up. One should not have to suffer the alternative.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/GM?

&gt;&gt;Keep kicking ass and taking names. We owe ourselves nothing less. And keep being as supportive and positive and you are. It means worlds to someone else across the world that you may never meet. We get thousands of views a day. Even if it's not apparent

&gt;&gt;I never thought that place would be as big as it is and I am humbled by it as well as challenged by the prospect of it getting bigger. And while I have the stage, newer mods. Sodypop can give jaxspider a run for his money and I love that the Courage Wolf gets changed every week because of sodypop. Likewise, the Monday Morning ModMail shoutouts. I love that shit.

Green Day is surely a name that most of you recognize. The group has been constantly releasing various very recognizable songs for the longest amount of time, that song has been released *nine* years ago, at which point they have long established themselves as one of the leading rock bands of its time.

What is now one of the most important punk bands of the past two decades began as a duo between the two childhood friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike ""Dirnt"" Pritchard at age 15. After having adopted the name ""Green Day"", Vocals), Mike Dirnt (Bass, backing vocals), and the later joining Tré Cool (Drums) and Jason White (Guitar, backing vocals)

It is thus no wonder that a small branch of its fanbase have found themselves on Reddit, under the control of three mods, who are the founder /u/Garin2010, and his two minions, /u/MispelledName and /u/Slapdown, whom I was able to ask some questions:


&gt;1\. What brought you into listening to Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I discovered Green Day just as I was also becoming acquainted with other bands like The Offspring and Rage Against the Machine. American Idiot was given to me as a gift from a family member after it was released in 2004 and I immediately became a fan. From then on I moved on to listening to their entire catalogue and have been following the band ever since.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I actually got into Green Day because I saw them in the ""Thank You"" area of a lot of albums, and it was love at first listen.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** I started listening to Green Day when American Idiot came out. I heard Holiday on the radio and loved the song

&gt;2\. Which one is your favorite album?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** As much as I would like to say that I have a number one favorite, to the much more modern rock sound that we hear today. The second album is Insomniac, for it's raw sound and punk roots. It's one of those albums that I point to when anyone objects to their punk beginnings.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite album is American Idiot, and you can't go wrong with crunchy guitar and well thought out lyrics.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite album would have to be 21st Century Breakdown because I love the music on the album and the lyrics. They just hit that spot we all have when listening to our favorite albums. I also tie that album in to being why I looked up all their previous records.

&gt;3\. What was your favorite experience with Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** My favorite Green Day experience was undoubtedly my first concert. I saw them in 2009 on their 21st Century Breakdown tour in Salt Lake City. I was a Verizon customer at the time and they hooked me up with free tickets, the whole VIP treatment. I was extremely lucky to have such an awesome experience at my first concert, and I still consider it one of the best days of my life.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite Green Day experience is when I saw them on the American Idiot Tour in Dallas back in '05. I was right on the rail at the very front

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite Green Day experience I've had would be learning and playing the songs on guitar. My girlfriend inspired me to pick up guitar again and learn the songs about 2 years ago. I've been ""Having a Blast"" ever since!

&gt;4\. What motivated you to create the sub?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I created the sub about a year and some months ago after coming on to other band centric subreddits like /r/blink182

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I'm so glad Garin created this sub, it's become a really great community.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** Garin has done an awesome job with the subreddit so far. Keep it up bossman!

&gt;5\. Do you wanna say anything to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I love the fact that our subscribers are very active! And if you ever see a helpless person lost in an /r/music thread

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** We have some pretty great posters

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** All I want to say to the present and future subscribers is: You guys are the reason the subreddit is awesome

To finish this up

My universal username is schampanes (shum-pun-ase), who introduced me to the site. I don't have a lot to say about myself, other than the fact that I like music of any form (which is the inspiration for this post), so I might be leaning more towards featuring music-oriented subreddits (or not, who knows?).

(Between re-watching clips of Pinky and the Brain on youtube)

&gt;What inspired you to create r/PatB?

&gt;&gt;I was inspired by the fact there's so much Pinky and the Brain love all over many subreddits, because I thought it might be fun to have an actual community for people to spread their PatB love.

&gt;What's your favorite subtle joke from Pinky and the Brain?

&gt;&gt;I don't have a favorite, ""I'll go down on you!"" the Brain pauses for a moment, and then says, ""I'll make cheese for you.""

&gt;/r/PinkyAndTheBrain is a relatively new subreddit. What are your goals? What content do you hope to provide to readers?

&gt;&gt;My goal is to have a community for fans of Pinky and the Brain where they can unabashedly share their love. Looking for content myself, I hope people stop and talk about the show once in awhile, and ponder who really is the genius and who really is insane. Basically, I just want it to be a place filled with complete adoration for the show and the titular characters.

&gt;Are there any similar shows on the air now that you'd like to recommend?

[Play this song for the optimal creepy feeling effect](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8)

It’s the middle of the night; thunder explodes in the distance and all the lights in the town have burnt out. You are surrounded by heavy fog and the sounds of waves splashing back and forth. A swift dark figure moves across in front of you and a voice echoes “I know you.” You search the buildings around you

The doorknobs refuse to turn as you wrap your cold wet hands around them. The flash light you found earlier flickers on and off and your radio grows fuzzier. You finally find shelter

You decide to find the source of the noise, but this time it sounds closer. This time you not only hear another crash, but feel the floor tremble and reverberate beneath you. You see a tall dark figure near the skyline. The siren goes off right behind you. You turn around to face that horrible screeching and everything goes black “GAME OVER.” 

_______________________________

It was all a video game, some more than others. R/creepygaming catalogues all those moments and more. Want to read about Pokemon horror stories ([Lavender Town anyone](http://www.rickey.org/the-lavender-town-syndrome/))? How about some creepy Skyrim tales? There are even crazy glitches and messed up used game cartridge stories (I’m looking at you [Majora's Mask](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/rzgv3/the_classic_zelda_creepypasta_day_four/)). 


Although r/creepygaming is a young subreddit (11 Days) it is growing fast and becoming a favorite amongst video game playing redditors (present company included).   

&gt;##1. What made you all want to start r/creepygaming?

&gt;&gt; **SpontaneousHam**: Full credit to Vidyabro who started the subreddit. I just asked to be a mod early on since I’ve always been a big fan of creepy atmospheres

&gt;&gt; **Vidyabro**:I have for a long time been interested in these so called ""unintentional"" scary things that can happen in video games. Myths, etc. When I noticed there was no such subreddit here I thought I just had to make one.

&gt;##2. What are your favorite creepy gaming moments?

&gt;&gt; **SpontaneousHam**: My overall favourite would be the reversed sounds from Half-Life 2. The fact that it’s hidden makes it so much better for me. Creepy Watson comes in a close second!

&gt;&gt; **Vidyabro**: There's probably a lot of them but I can't think of many right now.
The water part in Amnesia
Every G-man sighting in the half-life games
Looking for Bigfoot in San Andreas
First encounter with the ""bird-things"" from the first Silent Hill.

&gt;##3. What game first sparked your interest in creepy gaming moments?

&gt;&gt; **SpontaneousHam**: I remember reading about Polybius a few years ago and wondering how a game could scare people so much

&gt;&gt; **Vidyabro**:  Definitely Half Life. And the reason for that is G-man. The mystery of not knowing who he was or what he actually was doing on Earth really made me fall in love with the kind of atmospheric horror where the less you know about something the creepier it is.

&gt;##4. What game do you think if the creepiest game out right now?

&gt;&gt; **SpontaneousHam**: Fallout 3 for me

&gt;&gt; **Vidyabro**: The newly released SCP game ""SCP Containment Breach"" is probably the creepiest game I've ever played. Try it out

&gt;##5. How does it feel to be moderators of an up-and-coming subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **SpontaneousHam**: It feels great. I loved seeing the growth we’ve had and hopefully there’s more to come!

&gt;&gt; **Vidyabro**: It's nothing too special. It's just nice to know people are appreciating our work.

&gt;##6. Who’s creepier

&gt;&gt; **SpontaneousHam**: Slenderman for sure and especially so since I'm not proud of how long it took me to realize he wasn’t real. But shadow people are a creepy force to be reckoned with.

&gt;&gt; **Vidyabro**: That's a really hard question. Shadow people are kind of elusive in the way that they never actually do anything (or they don't seem to, but I'm gonna have to go with the shadow people, because of what I said earlier: ""the less you know about something the creepier it is."" Who would win in a fight? Probably the shadow people. Long limbs won't help if you're fighting shadows.

&gt;##7. Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of r/creepygaming?

&gt;&gt; **SpontaneousHam**: I must have the easiest job of any moderator; you guys make it so easy to filter out all the spam and keep the submissions great!

&gt;&gt; **Vidyabro**: Thanks a lot for sticking with us and posting great

Big thanks to SpontaneousHam and Vidyabro for providing me with these answers. I look forward to reading creepier video game stories that I can share with people that get horribly afraid easy.

It's true, unsung and sung heroes.  These are the music makers.  Let's look at the incredible force that was Fall Out Boy, for example.  On one hand you have lead singer Patrick Stump composing all the music and pretty boy Pete Wentz writing the lyrics.  Could they have sold 5.5 million copies of *From Under the Cork Tree* based on their own skill set?  Ooh, that's a big no.   This band had a crew of geniuses (wizards?) working to produce one of the most iconic albums of the early 2000's.  The producers, equipment crew, engineers... everyone came together to make this album and in turn, make me sound like an idiot in the shower.  

Today's subreddit is [/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers](/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers) - Music Production &amp; Composition.  This is one of those subreddits that intimidated me at first due to the level of discourse.  The discussions about producing music were Greek to me, (b) the community members are incredibly helpful, and (c) your coolness will grow exponentially!  WATMM is exactly what reddit is all about:  informative, interesting, welcoming.  I urge you to become a regular lurker like me.  Here to discuss this excellent subreddit is the creator and  head moderator, Originate!

&gt;Where does your subreddit's name come from?

&gt;&gt;The subreddit's name comes from a variety of places

&gt;Please explain [/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers](/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers). What will we find there?

&gt;&gt;I initially started WatMM (the acronym for We Are The Music Makers, recording methods, mastering, engineering, how to properly mic drums, etc. While these discussions still happen, people frequently post their music and request feedback. While we have a wide variety of users, and we try not to intervene unless something is grossly off topic or is obviously spam.

&gt;Now who or what is a ""music maker""? What level of music maker does this subreddit speak to?

&gt;&gt;Our subscribers are most obviously the music hobbyist. People who record from their garage, etc. We have professional engineers, touring bands, starving college students and people just learning to pick up the guitar, train their vocal chords or tickle the ivories.

&gt;Please tell us about your subscribers. Who's visiting and why?

&gt;&gt;People in WatMM are quite frequently looking to share their creations, breakthroughs in their recording and production processes, people looking for others to record with. One of our own Mods even worked with one of our subscribers from halfway across the continent to share create process on tracks and to mesh their styles into something more interesting.

&gt;Who are you! Please tell us a bit about yourself!!

&gt;&gt;I currently live in Colorado and have traveled all over the US. I have recently been traveling the globe lately. I turn 30 this year! I work in IT, bar none. I love art in all forms and am, as pedantic as it sounds, an audiophile and a cinephile at heart. I also very much enjoy comic books and am an adventurous eater that loves spicy food.

&gt;&gt;I produced several underground hiphop albums while living in Charlotte, xylophone and accordion for many years. I spent a lot of time working with a certain local pirate radio station in Boulder, Colorado. We were mostly a hit with pizza delivery and taxi drivers. Who else rummages around random radio stations as much as those people?

&gt;And now I'd like to pass the mic... tell us all what we can look forward to. 

&gt;&gt;We have a lot of things in process at the moment to try to improve WatMM

&gt;&gt;Something that I am particularly excited about, our first guest will be Terrence AKA. Lifeformed. Terrence is the fellow that composed the soundtrack to the Dustforce game and has been brought on to do the same for the new massively publicized Double Fine kickstart-ed game. I've already spoken with him and he has agreed to do this for us. This will occur toward the end of this month or the beginning of next, as we are both under water till that period of time. I hope to cross promote this with gaming, IAMA, music, etc So, look out for more things like this.

&gt;&gt;I've always tried to keep WatMM an educational place where people of any level of know how or experience can commune, feel free to share them with us. Help our community grow and learn!

&gt;&gt;We all love reddit! But we

Thank you *Originate*.  Thanks for doing what you do to help make reddit great.  I would be remiss not to mention Originate's parting message...

**A community for 9 months and already 6

Say what you will, South Park, American Dad, Spongebob (Ya, I said it. That damn sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea makes me giggle like a girl. Oh wait…). If you’re like me and find crass, sarcasm, and humor the best parts of a show, [this]( http://i.imgur.com/JLEGi.jpg) was my facebook profile picture for months), and [wordsauce](http://www.reddit.com/user/wordsauce)


&gt;How were you first introduced to Archer and what was your first reaction after watching an episode?

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle:** I saw commercials for it and friends mentioned it on Facebook. I finally gave it a try when I saw it on Netflix Instant and was immediately hooked.

&gt;&gt;**roger_:**  It came to my attention because it starred Jon Benjamin and Jessica Walter (and other AD cast members). I saw the first episode and knew it had a lot of potential. Wasn't sure it would find an audience


&gt;So we have some AD fans. Would you agree that Archer is a ""AD meets 007?""

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle:** I would agree somewhat

&gt;&gt;**roger_:**  Definitely

&gt;&gt;**Wordsauce:** If you think about it, and that Mallory and Oscar met in the military, but then Lucille stole Oscar away from Mallory just to stick it to her sister. Mallory ultimately decided to fake her death and start a new life under a new identity and used her connections to sick the FCC on the Bluths for revenge.
If you want to go deeper and keep it all in the family

&gt;What's your favorite part of being a mod?

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle:** I would have to agree with roger_ seeing and helping a community grow from a little small subscriber count to one that starts to hit the thousands. From my personal experience it is the mod(s) that really give the subreddits its first breath. No one knows about it so being a mod you have to cross promote and also bring it in conversations when natural in other conversations.

&gt;&gt;I'm also a designer by trade

&gt;&gt;**roger_:**  Helping the community grow. I can't really take the credit in this case since this is really wordsauce's baby, etc.) and a community forming around people who share something in common. It can take a lot of effort, but it's rewarding to know that it was all worthwhile.


&gt;What do you have to say to the people who don't watch Archer/ saw it but didn't like it?

&gt;&gt;**WoozleWuzzle:** I didn't even know those people existed. :) I personally haven't run into someone who has actually seen the show and said it wasn't for them. All I would say is give 2-3 more episodes a chance. If you don't like it that's gravy. Not everyone has to have the same interests as myself.

Well folks, and wordsauce. Now if you’ll excuse me, Kenny Loggins just called. I wonder what he wants to tell me.

I think one of the reasons people like jam bands is due to their seamless ability to work off of each other's playing and spontaneously come up with new riffs and variations while the rest of the band continues to play without interruption. As a band

I think it's the same reason people get addicted to text messaging or always play their music on shuffle. It's the spontaneousness of the act that is too interesting. You never have any idea when that person will text you back or what they will say

Although, even if it's just talking to your imaginary friends on the internet or the cute cashier at the grocery store.  You never know who you are going to meet tomorrow. You never know who you will meet, or what your interactions will be like! What a thrill ride. 

My life has been in a state of constant transients as of lately, if my memory serves me correctly.

I just got back from visiting my parents in rural Ontario, everywhere I looked, was ink.  Every single person under the age of 40 had some tattoo somewhere for all to see.  Some work was admirable, and some work was abominable, but every single person had one!  It's impossible to deny that tattoos are a huge part of our culture and 20 years from now, when our global addiction to high fructose corn syrup catches up with us, I believe we'll have a new subreddit to visit.  A place to post your before and after photos - it'll be like when you write on a deflated balloon with a marker and marvel at what happens when you blow it up.  Let's hope we'll all be around to witness that one!

If I may

* avoid all tattoos on sale

* a back tattoo is a fantastic idea.  If you've ever seen a dog chase his tail and thought, a back tattoo is what you need.

* tip verrry well and do it before the needle goes in.  ""Here's the $400 for the sleeve dedicated to Pop Pop

* never tattoo the name of someone on you

* always get tattoos of your 3 year old's artwork - never a bad move.  When they're 21 and breaking your heart, ""you did this to me!""  Or as we call it in my house, Thanksgiving.

Here's how r/guitar has changed my life.  Please feel free to share how it's changed yours.

I've been a guitar owner for 20 years.  I got my first acoustic in University when I was supposed to be studying, I got that good guitar repaired when I discovered r/guitar.  Now, in those 20 years I've had bursts of inspiration.  I learned Dave Matthews  &amp; Radiohead songs, classic guitar riffs, but I never had the desire to learn anything beyond what was immediately needed.  Sometimes I'd [hear a cool song on the radio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA7ycePZujY), but most of the time the guitar sat in the corner next to my dreams of becoming a competent musician.

Then along comes r/guitar like a cowboy on a steel horse (waaaaanteeed, but most importantly I found tons of info on how to really play the guitar.  Music theory, unlocking fretboard mysteries, guitar exercises, all kinds of stuff that was missing in my life.  No one will put this info into your head, but with a little digging, it's all there.  Now, I have an understanding of what I don't know &amp; can't do yet

Thanks r/guitar

Thanks to ninjaface for the great interview...

&gt;Please tell us all about r/guitar &amp; what readers will find there? How do you differentiate yourselves from r/guitarlessons?

&gt;&gt;ninjaface:  r/guitar is a place for people to share information

&gt;&gt;sm7:r/Guitar is a place for all things even remotely related to the world of guitar. We have everything from theory discussions, and it's a subreddit that focuses more on helping new players learn their craft (and getting some old ones back in shape, as well) while r/Guitar is really more of a general guitar discussion area.

&gt;Tell us about your amazing readership or fanbase. Who

&gt;&gt;sm7: Our readers really are amazing, and I'm extremely proud to be able to say that we still have barely any problems in r/Guitar that require immediate and/or direct moderation. We're a subreddit for all ages and skill levels, and the thing that initially attracted my own subscription to r/Guitar is the fact that I was very impressed at how helpful the readers were with even the most basic and often-repeated questions. Not once will you find anyone saying things like ""Ugh...this again?!"", much less anything harsher to a newer player. That, in my opinion, is what makes us so special.

&gt;&gt;ninjaface:  For me

&gt;What are you most proud of as a mod of r/guitar? What would you change?

&gt;&gt;nf:  As a mod

&gt;&gt;What would I change? Hmm... I guess the things I would change are more superficial aspects like our graphic

&gt;&gt;sm7:  There are many reasons why I'm proud to moderate r/Guitar. The readers are # 1,000 readers back in May of 2010. We're now at almost 20k readers a little more than a year later, have 4 mods in total, and I'm thrilled to have been a part of it from almost the beginning. I also feel privileged to be able to work with such awesome co-moderators as ninjaface and IsoscelesJones (and I have to mention Gonkulator here as well, who recently had to leave his mod post to tend to personal issues). These guys are not only 100% trustworthy and dependable, but they're so easy to get along with. It's like having close friends as co-workers, only we've never actually met IRL and our work is on a strictly volunteer basis.

&gt;Recently there's been some discussions around NGD posts. Please elaborate and tell us how it's going since the change was implemented.

&gt;&gt;sm7:I feel like all that needed to be said about NGD posts has been covered by ninjaface. Suffice it to say, as usual, responded with near-universal acceptance, and we've since seen a change for the better.

&gt;&gt;nf:  Oh man. The NGD posts. I'll start by saying that I personally love NGD posts. It's porn for me. At some point NGD posts became a bit controversial. There was a contingent of users who felt that they should be distinguished from other posts or relegated to a subreddit. We, but we'll find a solution that's easy and makes everyone happy eventually.

&gt;r/guitar has recently seen a large increase in number of readers. What do you think is the reason for this? What do you hope to see once you reach 2

&gt;&gt;nf: Yes, but it gives me a good feeling to know that I'm part of something this big and that people are enjoying what we've got going on. I think part of the attraction of r/guitar is that guitar playing is such a mysterious, multifaceted thing - especially when you're starting out. There are questions you're afraid to ask people, or information that is very difficult to glean from books and other media. Our reddit allows people to comfortably address the gaps in their knowledge and get the answers they need very quickly. We have a deep bench of amazing players who are experience with playing technique as well as the tech/repair aspects of the instrument itself. I learn things from these guys everyday. It's addictive. Maybe that's the secret of our success. I'm not sure, but I would just like to say thanks to the members and lurkers who make r/guitar a great place.

&gt;&gt;sm7:  I honestly have no clue what's driving up the number of subscriptions, as he was actually about to leave to go on an extended trip of some sort and would not be able to check reddit as much. He actually hasn't been back that much since then (except for here and there, putting the r/Guitar fundraiser together for example), so watching the reader numbers grow so significantly has been a real eye-opener. I felt like I must have been doing something right, but that something was actually nothing at all. The best communities are ones that require little moderation, and I think new readers were attracted to the subreddit for the same reason that I was...it's just a nicer brand of redditor (especially if you're a guitarist).

&gt;Anything else I forgot to ask? Anything you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;sm7:  Thank you to the team at SubredditOfTheDay for putting this together. Thank you to ninjaface, and Gonkulator for being such great co-moderators. Last but not least, thank you to all of our readers for making r/Guitar the main reason that I'm still involved with reddit in general, and for making the largest subreddit I moderate also my favorite.

Video games carry a lot of mixed emotions to some people. A good game will leave an impression on a person just like any good movie or TV show can. Engaging storylines and well thought out characters enhance the simple enjoyment of playing any game

It's also great for unloading that piece of shit game you thought you'd like but it turned out it's just too damn hard, or the graphics just plain suck. There's bound to be someone who would want to trade for what you've got. Joke's on you, sucker!

Let me preface the actual article with some writing of its own. Firstly, I'm going the opposite direction of a certain other activist subreddit I put up here near a month ago. That feature was full of references, hyperbole, and writing that those on a particular side of the bell curve couldn't seem to understand. This will be a bit more literal. Let's hope the vast ocean of hatemail that is my reddit inbox can slow down a bit this time.

What can I say about feminism? Not a whole lot, so I couldn't ask any friends for opinions. Usually I have others weigh in, and hardly ever write articles ""alone"". I'm flying solo this time, folks. Seven save us all. Instead of talking purely about feminism, I'll talk about its people and /r/feminism. That ought to work.

I first came upon /r/feminism last year while browsing various subreddits. I gave it approximately zero thought before continuing to observe hilarious images in /r/pics. However

Before this continues, and have similar readership numbers, yet its members are furious with one another and constantly cite quality and level of moderation to each other. I don't care about intersub politics, so I chose /r/feminism because it has the simpler name. There wasn't really any decision making process in that regard. Consider this a shout out to any other feminist subs that I don't know about or have less fortunate names.

Disregarding the fact that I'm breaking up every other sentence into its own paragraph, and that they should work to solve it. Some even work together, going against the ol' Us vs Them mentality that reddit seems to love so much. I love to see cooperation in any setting, and it warms my hearts when it does come up. Mostly because it doesn't come up often.

Since someone is going to point out that this feature isn't 100% glowing praise, I attended a Feminist rally following some sort of local outrage. I can't quite remember *what* caused it, which is how controversy usually works, but it was a pretty big deal. There, I met all kinds of folks, but mostly women (as is expected). Despite the odd looks I got being a 6'6 man in a crowd of short women (compared to me, everybody's short), I met the stereotypical feminist who looked like she would fit in better with a third world military, a friend I hadn't seen in a while... All great people.

More praise? You got it. /r/Feminism's submissions are always descriptive. None of this ""check this out!"" or ""you'll never believe what he said"" shit. Perfect for feed readers such as myself. Its comments section never fails in quality. The batting average of good to shit would make the MLB drool. You couldn't ask for a better subreddit for those interested in the subject matter.

And for further talk

&gt;#1. Hiya

&gt;&gt;**Pondhawk** I'm a new mod

&gt;&gt;**demmian** I am a redditor for 5 years; my hobbies are reading (spirituality, playing PC games (Starcraft, Deus Ex) and listening to music.

&gt;#2. Feminism is a pretty big deal

&gt;&gt;**Pondhawk** Aside from the big goal of equality? I'd like to work on dismantling gender roles.

&gt;&gt;**demmian** The main goal of feminism is equality. Some of the main issues it aims to address are:
 &gt;&gt;
[bodily integrity and autonomy]( http://redd.it/142nzm)
 &gt;&gt;
[fair wages and equal career opportunities]( http://redd.it/142o2s)
 &gt;&gt;

 &gt;&gt;
[the right to own property]( http://redd.it/146es0)
 &gt;&gt;
[the right to education]( http://redd.it/1475xh)

&gt;#3. Modding r/feminism can't be easy. What's it like doing the job?

&gt;&gt;**Pondhawk** I never really realized how much trolling happens on this subreddit until I modded it. There are a lot of people with a lot of time to waste. My modding day usually involves reading ""something

&gt;&gt;**demmian** Our biggest challenge to moderation comes from “feminist” extremists, they are also continuously trying to disrupt our community; their latest invasion thread was openly discussing ways to subvert the current moderation team, and I am looking forward to the day when admins will finally take notice of their disruptive activities and do something about them, and, for the time being, all that we can do is [prohibit the promotion of SRS]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TpHPEo3pG-QlB7dWCF-fcJFgayFmlQia-RjpKQGFP4A/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.s2xhgmwlzxci) in our spaces.
&gt;&gt;
We are also targeted by occasional threads from AdviceAnimals, and the likes. By and large, their moderators assist us in removing threads and comments that promote disruption of our community.
&gt;&gt;
Due to the fact that feminists on reddit are outnumbered, regardless of the initial topic); removal of the downvote arrow (even in recent experiments, many new threads are downvoted to the point where they disappear from the front page); a generalization of our /r/AskFeminists policy of having all top-level comments coming only from feminists (due to the fact that the starting point of  too many discussions was a non-/anti-feminist perspective). Hopefully, the situation will normalize in the future.

&gt;#4. Since I have a silly questions quota to meet: What are your favorite TV shows?

&gt;&gt;**Pondhawk** I waste my tv show time on reddit

&gt;&gt;**demmian** My favorite TV series are Firefly and Farscape.

&gt;#5. Wonderful. Anything else you'd like to say to the universe?

&gt;&gt;**Pondhawk** Buy an apple baking ceramic! Baked apples are delicious

&gt;&gt;**demmian** Social issues are a hot topic everywhere, energy and emotional investment. I am looking forward to the times when moderates from all sides can work together, since I too believe that this is the only way to move forward: working together and communicating. Feminism is a [highly diverse]( http://redd.it/166i8a) collection of movements and hopefully the moderate and egalitarian voices on reddit will be the representative ones.

It's a strange thing
I'm 21 years young and for the first time I am starting to feel like my own man. 

I move out on my own in a few days. DAYS. This is crazy. 
I have paid security deposits

Making decisions for yourself and taking responsibility is seriously more enjoyable than I thought it would be. It gives me a sense of control

Although I love to give the Ole' U.S of A crap for being a shitty, sex and money, it's really not to bad of a place to live. I usually am not a huge fan of politics, yet there is something about this upcoming election, the atmosphere it is creating that has me turning an ear, reading an article, watching a debate. 

In the coming months the political climate of the United States will undoubtedly change, and campaign efforts, can be daunting at best. Everyone has their own opinion and all candidates have pros and cons. 

Personally I hate to make any decision without scouring the internet for information on the subject. If i am going to try an illicit drug

Today's SROTD is /r/2012Elections. A catch-all used to provide you, congressional, gubernatorial and local candidates, campaigns, election polls, and eventually results! The sidebar is stacked with useful links and related political subreddits. It seems like a pretty fair an balanced community and the rules clearly ask not to up or downvote based solely on party affiliation. How considerate! hahah I highly suggest giving this subreddit your attention, at least for a few minutes. See if it grows on you. If you don't want the unstoppable flow of political vomit on your front-page, but if you want to try and inform yourself

&gt;&gt;Factran:  Hi ! Thanks for welcoming us in this special feature of subredditoftheday ! I live in Sweden and I mod several musical related subreddits.

&gt;&gt;octatone:  I am webdeveloper (I'm responsible for bringing you [reddit.tv](http://reddit.tv) and [radioreddit.com](http://radioreddit.com), WA, but am in the process of expatriating to Berlin, Germany to join a start up - just need to lock down an apartment and then I will be [getting out](/r/IWantOut ).

&gt;&gt;SockItToEmTJ:  I'm currently the production director at WITR-FM

&gt;**How long have you been with /r/Music? Since you've been here

&gt;&gt;Skuld:  Fairly new moderator, all the spam bots broke, and started to post in the other defaults), and they were pretty much true. I could go and report 100 spammers in /r/reportthespammers right now (and did a few times), and they'd all be back in a couple of days.

&gt;&gt;Factran:  I got /r/Music when it just had 100, with almost a million in about 2 years, that's a big boost ! We had some good moments, like the contests we organised, out 2 years, that's a big boost ! We had some good moments, like the contests we organised, and also Tommy Emmanuel

&gt;&gt;octatone:  I have been part of /r/music since forever (I have been a member of reddit.com for five years now)

&gt;&gt;SockItToEmTJ:  I've been with /r/Music since the original mod (I'm blanking on his name) gave up the position to Factran and I

&gt;**I can only assume that enforcing the rules at /r/Music is very time consuming. Tell us what do you do as a moderator here and how many hours are you looking at?**

&gt;&gt;Skuld:  It's a fairly impossible amount of mod-work. In the other subreddits I moderate, there's just so much stuff. Luckily we have the /u/AutoModerator bot well honed, so it's 98% genuine spam stuck in the filter. The primary, and most important things are to watch the report panel and the content of the images on the main page, and make sure to add smaller music subreddits to the master list linked in the sidebar.

&gt;&gt;Factran:  Yes, redditors. r/ListenToThis take the opposite stance, with an heavy moderation, and that's a good thing, because different set rules allow different communities to evolve.

&gt;&gt;octatone:  It's actually not that bad. With automoderater in full effect (auto-approving white listed content domains)

&gt;&gt;SockIt:  Most of our problems now are dealing with the spam queue

&gt;**Why do you do it? What motivates you to put in this amount of effort and time?**

&gt;&gt;Skuld:  Why? It's fun! I like queues and repetitive tasks (no sarcasm meant). It's nice to be able to directly affect the subreddits you care about the most.

&gt;&gt;Factran:  Because I appreciate musics of different places

&gt;&gt;octatone:  To keep /r/music from devolving into a pic dump.

&gt;&gt;SockIt:  I'm motivated by the fact that I love music and I want to see /r/Music be the best subreddit for music.

&gt;**Some redditors would like to see /r/Music head in the direction of music discussion rather than focus on youtube videos. Would you care to comment?**

&gt;&gt;Skuld:  The content is up to the community, discussion and song posts, but I'll have to just dream about that (now there's something for /r/ideasfortheadmins, content type slider percentage bars).

&gt;&gt;Factran:  We let the upvotes decide. Joining more specific subreddits often allows deeper discussion. We maintain a whole list of them, please put the youtube link, and add a stem, an opinion, something in the title that sparks discussion.

&gt;&gt;octatone:  /r/music is a general music related subreddit. We have few rules, spotify, soundcloud, etc. doesn't mean there is no discussion in the thread. And just because a post is a self-post, doesn't mean the thread is suddenly going to be civil intelligent discussion. They are ridiculous assumptions.

&gt;&gt;SockIt:  I'd ideally like to see music videos facilitate discussion

&gt;**Alright one final tough question. What do you find most challenging as an /r/Music moderator AND what would you say is your greatest achievement!**

&gt;&gt;Skuld:  he greatest achievement may seem a bit treacherous, and a table of the most popular genre subreddits in the sidebar, among other methods of promotion, and any music subreddit is welcome to advertise in /r/Music.

&gt;&gt;Factran:  I'd love to have even more diversity in r/music, we have very few, the ban list have only a dozen people, and we have a policy of free speech, even for assholes. That doesn't mean they're ok and welcome, though.

&gt;&gt;But the thing I'm most grateful for is the moderator team, the community, and the knights of [reddit.com/r/Music/new](http://reddit.com/r/music/new) !

&gt;&gt;octatone:  We actually have a really solid mod team and I really don't find contributing to the moderation effort in /r/music to be a challenge. My greatest achievement would probably be my meme-kill score. I don't keep track

&gt;&gt;SockIt:   I don't think moderating /r/Music really has many challenges any more since we've gotten the pictures rules squared away. As far as a greatest achievement

My deepest thanks for joining us today and for all the amazing work you do.  May music be forever in your heads and may you have songs in your soul.

Look [who's](http://i.imgur.com/hr21T.png) at it again. Appy-polly-loggies are in order. I have something of a pain  in the gulliver for the new age art trends so I had to just feature this sexy little sub-reddit. Ofcourse you know its trendy being late. ~~Thats my excuse.~~ I think the reason I keep [featuring](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/nmcph/december_22_2011_rgraffiti_reddits_very_own/) subreddits like this

If you don't know what stenciling is about... Fret not ol chap. This interview with [d9-thc](/u/d9-thc) &amp; [jaredcheeda](/u/jaredcheeda) will sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the ol' ultra-trendy.

&gt;##What motivated you to create /r/stenciltemplates?

&gt;&gt; **d9-thc** I finished reading a book called *Culture Jam* by this dude name Kalle Lasn (editor of *Adbusters* magazine). I thought of various ways of spreading ideas through alternative means

&gt;##Whats your background regarding it?

&gt;&gt; **d9-thc** My background is very minimal... I created the subreddit around the same time I began creating stencils and templates. Actually, we have a great mod team who are both more talented than I :)

&gt;##Whats the difference between /r/stenciltemplates &amp; /r/stencils?

&gt;&gt; **d9-thc** r/stencils is for stenciling in general... the large majority of posts on there are results photos, when I first began searching for templates to use, there was a noticeable lack of them in there, and there was no easy way to find them. r/StencilTemplates seeks to be a searchable archive of templates only. Results photos and general stenciling questions are welcomed in the comments, but the main focus is just for templates themselves.

&gt;##Tell us about your community. What makes them special? Also

&gt;&gt; **d9-thc** r/StencilTemplates is quite remarkable for the amount of growth it has experienced in such a short time, made by our members. I have also learned a lot and gotten much better at making stencils through the helpful comments people have made on various posts. As for the CSS &amp; layout, that can all be attributed to co-mod **Jaredcheeda**. That dude is a baller.

&gt;&gt;**jaredcheeda** Well, be it the vector version made in Illustrator or an unflattened Photoshop file. That's probably my favorite part. It allows others to not only use the template, but to easily modify it for their purposes. It also helps in critiques. We get a lot of people who are new to this and they want help. If the community can see the file they were working with we can suggest all sorts of ways to improve ones technique.

&gt;&gt; And thanks (referring to CSS comment). The look and feel of the place came from J_Anthony's brother who swooped in and CSS'd the place before I had a chance. Since then I've changed a bunch of it

&gt;##Whats are your favorite stencil(s) so far? Why?

&gt;&gt;**d9-thc** Probably [""The Pretty Reckless""](http://www.reddit.com/r/stencils/comments/o61cm/the_pretty_reckless_t/), and even had it as my desktop wallpaper for a while!

&gt;&gt; **jaredcheeda** It changes up constantly. When it comes to visual things, some even my own if I'm particularly happy the way something came out. Right now, I'm liking ""[I (heart) U Indiana Jones](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/oryzt/)"" By unicornsquid, just because it makes me laugh every time I see it. Before that was one of J_Anthony's, ""[Klonoa](http://www.reddit.com/r/StencilTemplates/comments/orafe)"". It came out looking really professional, hiding all the bridges in the image very well. Plus it was a character I hadn't heard of, so I got to find out about something new. And before that was one of my own, and the pose and angle are so different from how you normally see him. I just think it came out really well.

&gt;##If there was one stencil you'd like to see in every city which one would it be? Why?

&gt;&gt;**d9-thc** It's pretty cliché to like Banksy

&gt;&gt; **jaredcheeda** I don't know, great, it's THAT again... We get it, make something new"".

&gt;&gt;Something that I thought would be interesting though is if barcodes become more commonly used. There are plenty of websites that allow you to embed a small amount of text in a barcode. They're easy to cut out and spray

&gt;##In your view

&gt;&gt; **jaredcheeda** There's definitely some cross over between the two, [serves a very different purpose](http://img2.etsystatic.com/il_fullxfull.194518618.jpg). The point of stenciling is to put in a high amount effort/time up front so that you can quickly and easily reproduce an image multiple times. It's about pre-production, so when it's time to produce the image it takes a minimal amount of time and effort. It's all about the reproduction of an image.

&gt;&gt;I like how stenciling really lends itself as a cross-discipline to so many other things. You can borrow a lot of techniques you've developed in other areas to improve your stenciling process. And it's a wide area of cross disciplines: drawing, photo editing, logo design, type setting, collage work, graphic design, etc. That's what makes work from new people in the community always interesting.

&gt;##Could stencils ever be considered street art?

&gt;&gt; **d9-thc** In my own humble opinion, entertain, make someone think, make a statement, etc... none of which tagging accomplishes. Stenciling absolutely can be street art, though most people I talk to about it use it for other things, like making paintings on canvas or making their own t-shirts.

&gt;&gt; **jaredcheeda** They already are. There's plenty of examples out there

&gt;##If there is one reason to start stenciling

&gt;&gt;**d9-thc** If it's something that sounds appealing to whoever is considering it

&gt;&gt; **jaredcheeda** It's a quick


&gt;##Anything you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;**d9-thc** Seriously, so pretty much all the cool &amp; useful shit that makes r/StencilTemplates such an awesome community was their doing. Hats off to those guys!

&gt;&gt; **jaredcheeda** We've got a lot more growing to do

****
Today,  a 29 year old software developer (and software team leader) from Tel-Aviv, Israel.  Mr. Beats has gone and assigned himself a music discovery project where he'll listen to 30 - 50 albums a week.  The subreddit [/r/themvoices](/r/themvoices) was subsequently created as the vehicle to share his findings with the world.

[/r/themvoices](/r/themvoices) is much different than any other feature we've done.  First off, why would we choose to feature this guy?

I was immediately intrigued when my pre-interview questionnaire message was met with the following reply... 

*I want to tell you several things in advance. 1) English is not my native tongue. I understand it much better than I can express myself in it. Also I am dyslectic. 2) I was never interviewed before 3) I’m moderately intoxicated.*

We're saluting [/r/ThemVoices](/r/ThemVoices) today - an interesting music suggestion subreddit created by a most interesting individual.  

&gt;Please explain your music project.

&gt;&gt;My parents say that since I was a toddler I was fascinated by music. They say that they would put records and I would sit for hours with headphones and listen for hours a day. They couldn’t drag me away from any musical street show way into my teens.

&gt;&gt;I remember it being like an addiction. I couldn’t do my homework (or anything else for that matter) without having music in the background. I passed many stages: from crappy 80s through 70s, metal, grunge, goth, electronic music, experimental music, metal again and god knows what else. I had to have music around. I remember finding out Napster and various Undernet IRC channels to download new music. But even as a school boy I always made sure that I, buy the albums that I liked because I thought that it’s the fair thing to do.

&gt;&gt;After school

&gt;Can you break down the math?

&gt;&gt;In the last 16 months I've listened to about 2200 albums. That makes about 31 albums a week on average (currently I'm probably closer to 40-50 a week). This all happens in the background while I do other things.

&gt;So how does the subreddit fit into your plan.

&gt;&gt;When I understood that I’ve listened to around 2000 albums I thought that I don’t want to take all the gems I’ve found to the grave. So I’ve decided to publish my findings in some way or another. I had the decisive push from my friends who always nagged me to share some of my findings with them (ironically most of them are not on Reddit so I had to open a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Them-Voices/260272050661126?sk=wall) for them :) ). I thought about a blog for a moment

&gt;How do other redditors participate on Them Voices?

&gt;&gt;Well

&gt;&gt;Recently I’m toying with the idea of guest posts by the wonderful people I met on Reddit. It’s such a great community in that regard.

&gt;Where do you get your music mostly?

&gt;&gt;I use Wikipedia mostly to find bands. I have compiled a list of all the musical genres that I could find there (just checked and currently there are 891. Yeah

&gt;&gt;Then I download the albums or listen to them online. I do that by year to get the feel of each year. And write metadata (such as the score from 1 to 10

&gt;&gt;I listen to them in the background most of the day and only record the metadata every hour or so in a spreadsheet that is always opened in the background. So it almost doesn't distract me from whatever I'm doing.

&gt;&gt;Them Voices itself is moderately easy: I just pick interesting songs from albums that scored high or that I found interesting in some other way.

&gt;So what have you learned from your project

&gt;&gt;Oh

&gt;&gt;* [That bluegrass can be really awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8Ci6waZX1o)

&gt;&gt;* [That someone did weird 8bit childlike hip-hop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRex8S54VA)

&gt;&gt;* [That blues can be creepy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TdCfG2MdKA)

&gt;&gt;* [That lullabies can be even more creepy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgROpZn__0M)

&gt;&gt;* [That some 80s guys can still kick ass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBBjQOteJ8M)

&gt;&gt;* [That you can blend Black Metal and Jazz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qslyq8CcXu0)

&gt;&gt;* [That Jack White has a good taste in women](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsFqe9i0qmg&amp;ob=av2e)

&gt;&gt;* [That John Zorn is a genious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qisdzWPiLwA)

&gt;&gt;It also showed me how awesome the Reddit community is. I wasn't very active before I created Them Voices. But now

Who among us can honestly say we didn't grow up fantasizing about being Indiana Jones' sidekick, there was a time when George Lucas knew how to spin a yarn. But putting aside those three great movies (yes, I said *three*) for a moment, isn't there just something that itches all of us when it comes to the thought of searching for and finding buried treasure? 

For those of you who've always wanted to scratch that itch, navigate snake-filled pits, or run the risk of having your heart pulled out of your chest by crazy-eyed priests either. Following clues to seek out and find hidden treasure, though? Yep, that's what this subreddit is all about.

/r/finddit is a young and rapidly growing community where redditors play the role of either treasure-hunter or treasure-hider (and often both). Scroll through its front page and you'll find lots of posts with vague geographical clues to get you started in your quest. Check out the photograph the treasure-hider has submitted, catalog your success to brag about what a great treasure-hunter you are. It may not be *exactly* like Indiana Jones, but it's pretty damned cool. Also, it'll give you an excuse to go outside and venture beyond reddit into the ""real world"" we've all read so much about.

Last week I had the pleasure of dusting off my enigma machine to decode some cyphered messages left for me by /r/finddit's creator

***

&gt;What was the inspiration for this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**Grimmloch**: The inspiration was actually a post from another Redditor. He had spied a loose stone on his college campus and decided to hide a paper cut-out of Freddie Mercury with a U.S. Quarter taped to it in the hopes that a random stranger would just find it. He photographed his efforts and the item was found by another Redditor that saw the post and recognized the location. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kwvc9/i_found_your_quarter/).

&gt;So far

&gt;&gt;**Grimmloch**: The vast majority seem to be successful. I haven't folowed every post but the only one that I'm positive that hasn't been found is the 10k in us gold dollar coins hidden somewhere in New York City.

&gt;Over at /r/random_acts_of_pizza

&gt;&gt;**Grimmloch**: That is a possibility at some point. I personally don't have the skills to implement this

&gt;Your /r/ has grown pretty fast in the brief amount of time it has been around. Do you use any techniques to promote your /r/ that other mods might find useful in growing theirs? 

&gt;&gt;**Grimmloch**: This was all luck. When I saw the followup post, so I created it. By the time I had it ready, the comment and link to the sub was the #1 comment on the #1 front page post. The publicity was a gift from Reddit karma!

&gt;Have you personally hidden something yet? If so

&gt;&gt;**Grimmloch**: I have not

**To pioneer the future in space exploration

**543** space campers for **3** out of this world years!

Oh where to begin

Here is a fake factoid. When you were a little boy, space man, fire man or police man you were a communist. Other answers that were also acceptable but not as main stream where G.I.JOE, a Power ranger and a teenage mutant ninja turtle.

I could say some serious stuff about Nasa but thats just not my [style.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) I had wanted to feature r/Nasa for the longest of times

&gt; What got you to create r/Nasa. Or What got you to come to r/Nasa.

&gt;&gt; **dkozinn** I'm the new guy here. I've been a ""space fan"" for as long as I remember, and I've stuck around.

&gt;&gt; **PineappleMeister** Well we were not the ones who created r/NASA, was only active for about a year or so, the subreddit set abandon for 2 years until about [3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/iontq/hey_everyone_of_rnasa_im_the_new_moderator/), when I made a request to the admints to take it over. At the time there were no active users and about 180 subscribers. I was the only mod, the other two moderators (another_user_name &amp; dkozinn) came after I made a request for help because I was going to be busy and couldn’t manage it alone and I didn’t want to abandon it like the last mod had done.

&gt;&gt; **another_user_name** I work as a contractor at NASA Marshall. I love both aviation and space exploration and believe that space exploration is critical to the future of humanity.

&gt; What was your favorite space flight mission. Why? (If you have a link to the video even better!)

&gt;&gt; **dkozinn** I think there are two. The first was Apollo 11. Watching a human being walk on the moon was just so amazing. I was 11 years old and I remember [seeing Neil Armstrong step out on the moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-Sm4kTUGCc) watching with my folks and thinking how far mankind had come. (I still think about how it's been far too long since we were there last.) 

&gt;&gt; My second favorite flight was the second shuttle mission for one particular reason: At the time, part of the navigation system. We all got to ride up to Edwards Air Force Base on a bunch of buses and got to sit in the VIP seats (well, bleachers) to watch the landing. The sky was crystal clear (at least directly overhead; [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4UbqZWE2SA) shows some clouds in the area) and I remember being able to see the first pass of the shuttle when it was still at (I think) well over 100,000 feet. It was just such a thrill to be there.

&gt;&gt; There are a whole bunch of ""runner-up"" favorites

&gt;&gt; **PineappleMeister** My favorite NASA spaceflight mission has to be either Viking 1 or [STS-31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on7_7WZmdgI). Viking 1 was the first time human have landed (successfully) a man-made on Mars

&gt;&gt; STS-31 is also my favorite because it was the mission which launched Hubble Space Telescope into orbit and the Hubble Telescope has to be in my opinion NASA second greatest achievement (just behind Apollo 11). The images that it has provided put into perspective how insignificant we are. The famous “Pillars of Creation” picture is so beautiful yet so incomprehensible that makes you want to know more about what we have yet to find

&gt;&gt; **another_user_name** [Deep Space 1](http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/). It tested some very important technologies for spaceflight

&gt; If you could any one place in the universe

&gt;&gt; **PineappleMeister** There many planets we know of that are in the goldilocks zone

&gt;&gt; **another_user_name** Hard question. I see you bolded ""one, I'll take my impossibly powerful telescope and turn in back towards the solar system... or rather, where the solar system will be. If I happen to be moving back towards the solar system fast enough, I can watch the evolution of the Milky Way galaxy, the solar system and earth in fast forward as I run back into the light that originated from here billions of years ago.

&gt; Be honest

&gt;&gt; **dkozinn** I started wearing glasses when I was pretty young

&gt;&gt; **PineappleMeister** I knew from early on

&gt;&gt; **another_user_name** I actually would rather fly in the Shuttle's replacement. I decided to be an aerospace engineer at least 18 years ago

&gt; What are your present career paths?

&gt;&gt; **dkozinn** I work in information technology for a large global organization

&gt;&gt; **another_user_name** As it turns out

&gt; Anything you liked to add?

&gt;&gt; **dkozinn** One of my hobbies is ham radio

&gt;&gt; **PineappleMeister** I would like to give shout out Aeronautics side of NASA I think they do great work which is usually overlook 

&gt;&gt; **another_user_name** A few things.

&gt;&gt; NASA is the *National Aeronautics and Space Administration*. Do not forget the aeronautics part. The [X-43 Mach 9+](http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/x43-main.html.) scramjet demonstrator is an excellent example of NASA aeronautics project.

&gt;&gt; Being an aerospace engineer (aka ""rocket scientist"") is a really fun job. It took me 7 years of college to get a master's degree in the subject and it's been definitely worth it. I highly recommend it (and most forms of engineering) as career paths. They teach you how to think about problems better than anything else. Pre college

###*Videos you can watch while eating your lunch.*

**100** redditors on their lunch breaks. Watching videos during lunch for **1** month.

Have you ever sat down in front of your [computer](http://vicksburgdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Steve-Jobs-300x251.jpg ""My first smartphone was an iPhone 3GS."") to eat, all these videos are [soo short](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtT9X4eT_Ss ""To be honest, Julia Roberts is terrifying to all non-humans."")? You hands are already messy so either you're going to have to get your mouse all [sticky](http://i.imgur.com/lVaOv.jpg) or your going to sit there like a silly goose and not watch anything while you eat. I've been a silly goose but not anymore. I present to you, r/LunchVideos. Similar to regular videos, only every video needs to be 15~45 minutes long and with less animals doing wacky stuff. Not that thats a bad [thing.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uDuls5TyNE ""5 minutes of fat cat action."") Its one of those, its so simple, why didn't I think of that sub-reddit?

I gotta mention, but worth every second of it."") due to r/LV. I'm here with the creator of r/LunchVideos. I learn [first hand](http://i.imgur.com/8rEYu.jpg ""I'm soo excited about Arrested Development coming back!"") the interesting way r/LV came to be. 


&gt; 1) Why did you created r/LunchVideos?
&gt;&gt; Strangely, it couldn't fulfill this purpose as some of the videos were ~10 sec long and required constant switching and navigation. So I decided to create /r/lunchvideos; videos that are long enough that you could watch uninterrupted while eating your lunch (15-45 mins).

&gt; 2) How did people hear about the subreddit?
&gt;&gt; I never really posted anything to /r/LunchVideos after creating it, someone posted a 45 minute video documentary to /r/videos about rivalries between graffiti artists Banksy and Robbo. People really enjoyed it and thought it was informative. There were specific requests for a subreddit that featured longer videos, documentaries, shortfilms, talks rather than shorter, less meaty videos. LunchVideos was exactly this, so [I replied to that comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/kd9l1/graffiti_wars_banksy_vs_king_robbo/c2jfldj) and about a hundred redditors joined the community.

&gt; 3) What is your favorite video so far?
&gt;&gt; I'd have to say my favorite video was the one that started the subreddit: [Graffiti Wars: Banksy v/s King Robbo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/lunchvideos/comments/ke269/graffiti_wars_banksy_vs_king_robbo/)

&gt;&gt; The original link has since been removed

&gt; 4) Where do you see r/LunchVideos going in the future?
&gt;&gt; In the short term

&gt; 5) Tell us something about the community.
&gt;&gt; So far the community is fairly small. With a hundred odd redditors and one moderator (myself), the original mission of this subreddit was to not get your keyboard all greasy, so I can't really blame anyone.

&gt;&gt;That's it! Thanks for reading. And if you like documentaries, comedy routines etc. that are 15-45min long, I'm sure you'll love /r/LunchVideos. We'd be happy to have ya'.

All it takes is one bad day to make you crazy.  Just ask /r/batman; he had a bad day once, smile!  And who better to put that smile on your face then your friendly neighborhood /r/joker?

Who doesn’t want to be The Joker?  Well, a permanent smile, and a lot of toys that never work the same way twice, but almost always leave you laughing.  You only have to give up your sanity, and were you really using that for anything productive?  Plus, come on, you have a personal relationship with Batman!  Who doesn’t want to meet Batman?

/r/joker is a community dedicated to [the playing card](http://www.ironcowprod.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/joker_retro.jpg).  Just kidding!   Also, I may wind up dead somewhere in Gotham, permanent grin in place.  Obviously, it’s about the best Batman villain ~~that isn’t Harley Quinn~~.  If it’s related to The Clown Prince of Crime, you can find it here.

I decided to sit down with **wockyman**

What are you

&gt;#1. When did you realize the Joker was awesome enough to have a subreddit dedicated to him?  

&gt;&gt;**wockyman** I was browsing /r/batman one lazy day and noticed that fully half of the posts were about the Clown Prince of Crime rather than the caped crusader. Shortly after, intricate schemes, and he wears black. So of course the rogues that developed to oppose him are the best in the comic world. But the Joker isn't just that. He's the trickster archetype incarnate. He's a murderous Bugs Bunny. He's a modern myth.

&gt;#2. What do you expect from the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**wockyman** I expect nothing, to celebrate hitting 1001 subscribers, I posted ""/r/joker is now about the playing card only. Posts about the comic book character will be deleted."" It seems a few people took me seriously, and we quickly dropped to 998 subscribers.

&gt;#3. Obviously
&gt;&gt;**wockyman** I swear Mark Hamill performs invocation rituals before doing voice work. He will always be my favorite

&gt;#4. So you meet someone who’s lived under a rock for the past 70-some odd years

&gt;&gt;**wockyman** I'd like to say Batman: TAS - S01E22 - Joker's Favor

&gt;#5. You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?

&gt;&gt;**wockyman** HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA

I’m not sure that’s good.  Thank you, I’m off to find a gas mask.

**789 Corps for 10 Months!**

Hola Everyone! :D

The other day i witnessed a debate if superheroes are needed for the society. Now i am a hardcore comic superhero fan. I read all the marvel and DC comics and i can assure you they are NEEDED. 

Green Lantern is my most favourite comic series. More than batman

[Green Lantern Corps](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081229231438/greenlantern/images/e/eb/Greenlanterns.jpg) are a group of soldiers or space corps headed by the [Guardians of the universe](http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/files/2011/05/guardians_.jpg) to protect the habitants of this universe and bring Justice. The origin of green lantern series starts when [abin sur](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090107005522/greenlantern/images/1/1b/653349-abin_super.jpg), [Kyle Rayner](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080626222343/greenlantern/images/3/35/KyleRayner.jpg), [John Stewart](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090107072835/greenlantern/images/3/3f/John_Stewart-1.jpg) each excelling in this noble quest of saving the universe. Green lanterns have also been the part of the celebrated american Superhero team, Justice League of 'merica! :D

Now for people who don't follow the comics, [Sinestro Corps](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090427022816/greenlantern/images/3/39/Sinestro_Corps.jpg) signifying Fear, [Blue lanterns](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090427022439/greenlantern/images/5/5d/Blue_Lantern_Corps.jpg) signifying Hope, [Indigo tribe](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090427202049/greenlantern/images/f/f8/Indigo_Lantern_Tribe.jpg) signifying Compassion, [Start Sapphires](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090428193540/greenlantern/images/6/60/Star_Sapphire_Corps.jpg) signifying Love, [White Lanterns](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100401113657/greenlantern/images/d/dc/White_Lantern_Corps.jpg) signifying Life and [Black lanterns](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090427022349/greenlantern/images/a/a6/Black_Lantern_Corps.jpg) signifying Death.

Life, Greed, Hope, Courage, Love , Compassion, Fear are all part of the Human experience. Green Lantern series show the significance of each of these entities. It shows what happens if a man falls into the pits of hell by rage and how he soars to the heavens when armoured with the wings of courage. How fear can destroy the world and bring it to darkness and how hope can spark a light even in the depths of darkness.

If anyone cares, Cocky Young Green Lantern who was chosen to be a GL by pure luck, an underdog, who rose to bring back the whole Green Lantern Corps from extinction and in my opinion the greatest of all the lanterns. I can go on for hours why Green Lanterns are so awesome but I dont think the other mods *cough* Jaxspider *cough* have so much patience to listen/read :D

Of course this feature cannot end without the famous oath of the Green Lanterns .. 

[*""In brightest day
No evil shall escape my sight  
Let those who worship evil's might
Beware my power


Looking at /r/lanterncorps

&gt;##1. If you could become some lantern which one would you be ? and why ?
&gt;&gt; **Cobradeus:** If I could become some lantern I would probably pick Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps. I really love his calm and collected attitude. Especially considering despite all that he still knows how to defend himself and get the upper hand in most situations.

&gt;##2. who is your favourite green lantern and why ?
&gt;&gt; **Cobradeus:** My favorite green lantern is Avra from the Emerald Knights. I always like those under dog stories! From a lowby to one of the legends of his day!

&gt;##3. What do you think green lantern teaches the society ?
&gt;&gt; **Cobradeus:** I think Green Lantern has the potential to teach a lot to people. The Green Lantern rings are powered by Willpower, despite how scary things can get, there's always a reason to stand up for yourself, and what you believe is the right thing to do, even if your large blue headed superiors think otherwise.

&gt;##4. Do you have anything to say to your readers and future readers ?
&gt;&gt; **Cobradeus:** I just want my readers


Thanks for reading and a Happy Friday!

For two very good reasons

1)  it's the coolest subreddit around.  No disrespect to the other incredible subreddits we feature

2)  *umbrae*

I'll let our guest describe it in his own words.  Here to tell us more about serendipitybot and his subreddit is *umbrae*!

&gt;Please take a moment to describe /r/serendipity and how it works.

&gt;&gt;/r/serendipity is a meta-subreddit that posts a top link from a random subreddit every three hours. It's a simple concept

&gt;So you created a bot that takes the top posts from random subreddits

&gt;&gt;Yep

&gt;&gt;(1) It's not marked as a NSFW subreddit.      
&gt;&gt;(2) It has at least 1000 subscribers.     
&gt;&gt;(3) It existed the last time I synchronized my subreddits cache (updated about once a month).

&gt;&gt;If it's fully random

&gt;&gt;I used to have the minimum subscriber count at 2000

&gt;What's the objective or goal of /r/serendipity? Why'd you create this?

&gt;&gt;**tl;dr: I read a book with great concepts in it

&gt;&gt;Sorry about the long

&gt;&gt;The idea itself came out of a book I was reading about a year ago - [Where Good Ideas Come From by Stephen B. Johnson](http://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594487715). It's a really fantastic book that dives deep into ideas themselves and how they come about.

&gt;&gt;Two of the key concepts in the book struck me as I was reading it, you're probably more connected to interesting stuff through reddit than anything else in your life. So reddit is great there.

&gt;&gt;The second concept was itself called serendipity

&gt;&gt;Reddit, I'm going to get a lot about science and nothing about, say, knitting.

&gt;&gt;I built /r/serendipity to try to solve that problem for myself: by forcibly injecting randomness into my subreddits

&gt;My God that's beautiful.  Why would someone subscribe to your community?

&gt;&gt;I think for the same reason they subscribe to SRotD! If you want to find new

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;Oh man. Uh.

&gt;&gt;The reddit admins see /r/serendipity and consider adding the concept into reddit as a whole.

&gt;&gt;I get some good feedback from this community on how to improve it!

&gt;&gt;More /r/dogfort. I can't believe I've never seen it pop up yet.

&gt;Any other cool stuff you've done that we should know about? What's next from umbrae?

&gt;&gt;Ha! Well gee

&gt;&gt;(1) I'm currently the CTO of [Readability](http://www.readability.com)

&gt;&gt;(2) If you're into ideas, but they're doing incredible work.

&gt;&gt;(3) A few months ago I built a little site for fun called [CanIStream](http://www.canistre.am/) that can tell you if a movie is available for legal streaming online. I might open source that soon.

&gt;&gt;As far as what's next

&gt;&gt;One more thing - thanks so much for the interview and for running SRotD! Our subreddits are very alike in a lot of ways. Hopefully some of your subscribers will find it interesting - any feedback much appreciated!

Like many who travel to the Site that Snoo Built, despite all obstacles, he would become a star.

Alas, he barely had enough comment-karma to feed his family.

Then it happened. On a whim

Most of the responses to that question were glib. Hornswaggle's was not. 

Suddenly

Alas, high profile arrests that sent the up-and-coming star's career into a tailspin. Finally, during a controversial 20/20 interview he hit rock-bottom when he declared himself ""bigger than [Karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/user/karmanaut)"".

The ensuing outrage from the Reddit community was tabloid fodder at its finest. Paparazzi began to stalk him; many called for his permaban from the site itself. The backlash against the rising star sent him crashing down to earth

Then something magical happened. According to unconfirmed reports, decided to help Reddit's newest star. In a mission of mercy, Wil quietly gathered such reddit notables as [ProbablyHittingOnYou](http://www.reddit.com/user/probablyhittingonyou), [Reaction_On_My_Nub](http://www.reddit.com/user/Reaction_On_My_Nub), and [Forthewolfx](http://www.reddit.com/user/Forthewolfx) to help with an intervention.

All were accustomed to the pitfalls of reddit fame. All

While the details of that secret meeting remain the subject of much conjecture and speculation, like many reddit-celebrities before him, came to terms with his success. He is now reportedly on the straight and narrow and, more importantly, writing again.

Nothing could make the fans of [/r/1985sweet1985](http://www.reddit.com/r/1985sweet1985) happier. As they wait with baited breath for the next installment of his opus, and give Mr. Hornswaggle a call. He answered on his cutting-edge ""cordless phone"" and agreed to participate in the following, exclusive interview.

***

&gt;Hornswaggle

&gt;&gt;**Hornswaggle:** I want to thank you

&gt;Let's get the obvious question out of the way: what on earth compelled you, novella-length saga? What compelled you to create/start this young /r/?

&gt;&gt;**Hornswaggle:** I was compelled to free-think on the realistic reaction that would come from liferebootdotcoms suggestion. Most responses at that time were short and the highest rated post was about buying Apple and Microsoft. My first thought was: ""Where would you get the money? How would you get a job to get the money?"" It occurred to me that there were more real

&gt;Your /r/ already has over two thousand subscribers. In reddit terms that is a smashing success. What are your thoughts on the why and how of this?

&gt;&gt;**Hornswaggle:** The number of people following my sub are an astounding and humbling reaction to what I've written. I'm am still a little overwhelmed. As to why and how... I think people crave realism in a saturated media landscape of contrived originality and that is the pretentious response. Huxley's Brave New World is here and the telling of a genuine story still touches people where it counts. People want to have their shields circumvented

&gt;I notice that your /r/ retains the default reddit graphics. What would you think about Marty McFlyin' up the reddit alien

&gt;&gt;**Hornswaggle:** I am a complete neophyte on the workings of reddit and it's potential. I don't even have the enhancement suite. I would certainly consider some additions once I focus on finding a suitable image.

&gt;Writing fiction can be a chore. How much research did you do in order to create this story? In other words

&gt;&gt;**Hornswaggle:** I am discovering just how much of a chore it can be. Moving forward with the story will require research, but that recent installments have been written at home. But, given the nature of corporate behavior towards it's loyal employees over the past few years, I consider the lack of cost-of-living raises a fair trade.

&gt;Without spoiling anything

&gt;&gt;**Hornswaggle:** I am giving serious thought and research to direction. One of my more out-there ideas was kyboshed by simple math, the research takes time and I want to deliver for the people who have written and commented. They have lifted me up with their praise and encouragement and I want so badly to keep the feeling and momentum going. To be clear, I do not have an end game, but I have something I feel will propel the story forward with some real depth and represent a real challenge for me as a new fledgling author. (still feels weird to self-identify that way)

**150** Lego men buiding the things they love for **22 days**

As you know we at /r/Subredditoftheday have already featured r/Lego a while [back](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/kles7/september_20th_2011_rlego_something_to_do_in_your/). Cuusoo takes Lego to the next level. One that others can hope to share. If you love lego

Its basically simple. Got an idea for a Lego playset? Design it, and if its accepted, put it up for a kickstarter thing that need 10,000 supports and BAM! You playset gets made! For real. For everyone to buy. How does that not kick ass? Its like the good part of Come Sail Away from Styx. COME SAIL AWAY! COME SAIL AWAY! COME SAIL AWAY WITH ME!!! Yeah!

So get out those lego blocks, get set... LEGO MY EGGO! 

*The following interview was conducted by our very own /u/SidtheMagicLobster.*

&gt;Please introduce yourselves! What is CUUSOO

&gt;&gt;**inloveagain**: My name is Dennis. I am a 32 year old AFOL (Adult Fan Of Lego). I started /r/cuusoo because /r/lego is getting big enough that it makes sense to have sub category. Of course, promote, and share our favorite projects. I added glenbricker as a moderator, since he is also a big fan of CUUSOO and wrote [The Unofficial CUUSOO User's Guide](http://blog.brick-hero.com/2012/07/cuusoo-users-guide-part-1-what-is-cuusoo.html).

&gt;&gt;""Since 2008

&gt;&gt;LEGO CUUSOO International was introduced in early 2011 and now anybody may submit a concept. The LEGO company will review all projects that reach 10

&gt;&gt;**glenbricker**: am Glen and I am a 35 year old AFOL (Adult Fan Of Lego). I am very happy Denis started this subreddit because I had no idea it was possible to start subreddits as people not affiliated with Reddit directly. I think the subreddit is important because a lot of Lego fans do not understand/want to see Cuusoo stuff and the subreddit is a great way for them to opt out of it.

&gt;&gt;I wrote the Cuusoo users guide and run a blog about Cuusoo. http://blog.brick-hero.com/ I am also a very active member of the Texas Afol community (TexLUG) and run their website.
I explain in the guide what Cuusoo is and why any Lego fan should participate. That covers it better than I can here.

&gt;&gt;I got involved with Cuusoo because I am a nut about Lego and wanted to influence what Lego was offering. At first I thought it was a line of Vertigo from DC comics and anything could fly...but I have realized that is not the case...it is a Beta system and it is always evolving. Regardless a lot of my early projects were Dr.Horrible and a series of Firefly sets.

&gt;Why has lego stuck with you the way it has?

&gt;&gt;**ila**: I grew up with Lego, let's just say.

&gt;&gt;I don't just collect the built

&gt;&gt;**gb**: Lego sticks with me because it is an adaptable yet limited art medium. There are so many things you can do with it and the people who participate with it are the coolest people I have ever met. Every community has it's...for lack of a better word...Dicks, opinions, and even bricks...There are no age barriers either...which is crazy when you think about it.

&gt;What is your proudest lego creation? 

&gt;&gt;**ila**:My proudest creatings growing up were the small towns I built. Nothing was very significant, and maybe a business or two. Later, when I had more Technic parts, I liked to build large and functional vehicles. Now that I am older, and have lots more money, I can build whatever I want. So I went big. I bought about a dozen Lego sets and lots of individual bricks online. I've been working on my project on and off for about six months now and I am about 95% finished. I just have to place one more order online, and I will be done. It's a large scale, controlled remotely. It will be my first submission to CUUSOO.

&gt;&gt;**gb**: I have several builds that I am proud of

&gt;&gt;The Hammership is the build I am constantly working on in some way or another: http://blog.brick-hero.com/2012/07/my-own-creation-hammership.html

&gt;&gt;I love my vignette: Sudden but Inevitable Betrayal. I am proud of its accuracy: http://blog.brick-hero.com/2012/05/mini-damn-heros-firefly-minifigs.html

&gt;&gt;And I am proud of my Orrery as an example of kinetic art: http://blog.brick-hero.com/2012/06/quidditch-orrery.html

&gt;&gt;Of my Cuusoo projects I am most proud of my Corellian Defender: http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/11084

&gt;&gt;It is a beautiful craft and I think I have done a damn fine job on its complex geometries if I do say so myself.

&gt;What's the coolest one you've seen from the project?

&gt;&gt;**ila**: It is very difficult for me to choose a single favorite model currently on CUUSOO. A few that come to mind include: the [10x4 Dump Truck](http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/14819), [Brick-Sorting Excavator](http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/22356), [ARC-170 Starfighter](http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/17002), and [Johnny 5](http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/15166). Of the four currently in review, I think the [Modular Western Town](http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/1787) may be the best idea and most likely to go into production.

&gt;&gt;**gb**: Coolest project on Cuusoo is a weird one. Again

&gt;&gt;Coolest Technical Achievement is http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/22356

&gt;&gt;The sandcrawler is beautiful though I am not sure it can translate well into an actual product http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/1786

&gt;&gt;The handicapped accessibility pack is the most socially aware http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/19418

&gt;&gt;Transforming gaming accessories is the most fun http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/14089

&gt;&gt;But these Ambulances are the Best Lego sets I have seen http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/17901

&gt;&gt;But more than anything I WANT this Valkyrie Macross VF-1 Valkyrie +Fast pack / Armored parts http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/638

&gt;What does one need to know about the sub/project before joining?

&gt;&gt;**ila**: Anybody can join /r/cuusoo for any reason. I hope more people will become interested and excited about the project.

&gt;&gt;**gb**:My guide on Cuusoo should tell you everything you need to know about Cuusoo for making a project. Sometime this weekend I hope to have published the guide of hints to make a successful project

The first time I saw Mindy, awkward like only a young teenager can be. Despite all that, she seemed to dig me, and we got to talking. Her, the Babe in Red, talking to *me*. What a country.

Even now, the way she smiled, the way she laughed. I never even noticed that one of her eyes never moved. She exuded self confidence and self-worth. After almost sixteen years, the memory of her in that dress, the night I fell in love with her, remains vivid in my head.

Somehow I managed the courage to ask her out and she said yes. That should have been the first clue that she had mental health problems, in which we had wild adventures that I shall keep for myself. Not everything should go onto reddit. Some things a man must keep for himself.

A time came when she became sad. Not because of anything I did. Not because of *anything*

Thankfully, but I told her that I loved them. Because I did. To this day I still dig scars, and probably because of hers and all the time we spent together that wonderful summer. A night in the park, with her, was as amazing as anything else I could even imagine. She had such energy!

Then, the change in her demeanor came so quickly. Smiles faded into frowns. Her facilities. Her personality. She became nearly another person.

In the end it was simply too much for a 17-year-old jmk4422 to handle. I broke up with her because I simply could not handle the wild swings in her mood. She was bipolar
A high-schooler's drama.

She's doing well now. All these years later, the Babe in Red, should give you inspiration. If she could overcome it, you can, too.

I sent a few questions to the moderator of /r/bipolar

***
&gt;What qualifications do you have to run a subreddit that focuses on a serious mental-health issue?

&gt;&gt;***stupidmelon13***: I have no qualifications related to bipolar disorder whatsoever, despite having symptoms since birth really. I feel that being on this end of the spectrum can be more helpful than reading books and doing exams about it, I know how it feels and what it does to a person. Surely, this is something that gives me an upper hand when running the subreddit?

&gt;Obviously no online forum can be a replacement for the help of a real, what is the purpose of /r/bipolar?

&gt;&gt;***stupidmelon13***: I do feel that for me to give advice I should be qualified, at least I will be helping. So the main purpose is basically to make an area for bipolar, like a bench in a park reserved especially for anyone who wants to use it how they wish.

&gt;Has there been a particular post in your subreddit that has really impressed you for any reason? If so

&gt;&gt;***stupidmelon13***: Yes! A lovely lady called carolineraer painted a beautiful picture and posted it at my request. It is her artistic impression of bipolar and I thought it was brilliant. [This is it](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/opc8s/my_artistic_interpretation_of_bipolar_disorder/).

&gt;Let's talk history: your subreddit has existed for three years

&gt;&gt;***stupidmelon13***: /r/bipolar was inactive until a month ago. There was no Mod and very few people in the sub, it is doing much better now!!!


&gt;Say I'm a redditor with no mental health issues at all: none personally

&gt;&gt;***stupidmelon13***: Well the simplest response for that is that I would say people may want to learn about it. I have never been to France, BUT I still enjoy learning their languages? It contains posts which could certainly open your eyes to how other people live, you could offer advice from an outsiders perspective or even just post about what you think bipolar is.

&gt;I love your Snoo-- easily one of the simplest

&gt;&gt;***stupidmelon13***: This guy was brilliant. I made a little post about needing a logo, such a simple and perfect design which speaks for itself. One side shows the Manic episode part of bipolar, the other shows the depressive side. I think I have the best logo on the whole of reddit!

My thanks to stupidmelon13 for the interview

On a personal note
Good luck to all of you

Best

&gt;&gt;The making of is all about the art of creation be it film, especially when it's a film I really admire.

&gt;Beyond ""how movies are made""

&gt;&gt;That's a great question and I wouldn't be opposed to that at all, lighting and even creating cars, so it's not such a big leap for the subreddit to branch out into other parts of the creative process.

&gt;Do you have a favourite post?

&gt;&gt;I really like the old movie magic shows the one on forced perspective is a favourite of mine. I recently came across an old documentary by George Lucas about Francis ford Coppola(one of my favourite directors) that i thought was great to watch, the amount of work that went into that shot is crazy.

Ever since I heard about this Slender Man wooded dark areas freaked me out. [Then I heard about Slender](http://i.imgur.com/jN43q.jpg)
I still owe her for completingthat challenge. 

Needless to say

&gt;##1. What made you want to start /r/Slender_Man?


&gt;&gt; **mansardroofs**: There was a lot of Slender Man-related posting on r/nosleep

&gt;##2. What are your favorite Slender Man related things?

&gt;&gt; **mansardroofs**: The characters in the mythos have so many different interpretations and meanings based on who's incarnation of them. As for a single character, EverymanHybrid/MLAndersen) the creators of some of the series are.

&gt;##3. Have you played Slender? What are your thoughts on it?


&gt;&gt; **mansardroofs**: Played it for 10 minutes. Got scared. Haven't touched it since. By that vein


&gt;##4. What do you hope happens with the Slender Man mythos?


&gt;&gt; **mansardroofs**: Hahah

&gt;##5. Do you think Slenderman watches you at night while you sleep?


&gt;&gt; **mansardroofs**: We watch each other while we sleep. We also share a bed. Is that weird?


&gt;##6. Who would win in a fight Slender Man or Shadow People?


&gt;&gt; **mansardroofs**: Going to go with Slendy. Shadow People can be gotten rid of by thinking happy thoughts, bag-of-guts filled trees and totally make those guys disappear.


&gt;##7. Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of r/slender_man?


&gt;&gt; **mansardroofs**: He's watching you.

Redditor okayyeah says this: The idea for a survey-based subreddit has sort of been floating around in my head for a while now. After I saw the huge response (+19, embrace it, and be excited enough about it to help support the creation of r/SampleSize...

*Hello?  Where are you calling from?  And why are you yelling at me over calypso music?  Who is this?*

*""Sir my name is Rich

*""Yes I got that part

*""Yes you most definitely did, as much as the typical redditor, AND get excited about learning more about stuff?""*

*""Look my name is not Turntables

*""Wait!  I haven't even told you about the greatest subreddit known to mankind since the dawn of time... [/r/SampleSize](/r/SampleSize)!""*

*""[/r/SampleSize](/r/SampleSize)?""*

*""Awwww Yissss

*""Well

*""I'd love to

&gt;You've been around for a month now

&gt;&gt;Calypsee:  Well I remember seeing an AskReddit about it. I think the idea that okayyeah had [I think it was okayyeah] was that surveys aren't allowed in AskReddit [and NEVER get upvoted], but we've been growing steadily since then as well.

&gt;&gt;phaelyn:  I think the entire thing that started this was a post in AskReddit from some kid surveying everyone about...ice cream flavors, I think there was a pretty large influx of surveys into the sub, so within a few days, okayyeah wrote up a post suggesting a sub dedicated solely to surveys. A bunch of people came over (traffic stats tell me we got over 800 subscribers in the first day!) and the rest is history.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;Surveys, for example, and they need help getting a big sample. We do what we can to help out. We the mods also have been putting together subreddit surveys of the week. So far we've done r/guns, r/nintendo, r/atheism, r/chrome and r/guitar. Many more planned for the weeks to come though!

&gt;Why? What purpose does /r/SampleSize serve? What can we do with the data collected?

&gt;&gt;Calypsee:  Again, or just for fun like our subreddit surveys of the week, or the random polls that are around. Also, the results of surveys are frequently requested, and even delivered, a fair number of times. We always post the results for our subreddit survey of the week, but we also get to see results of some of the smaller studies as well, and they've been getting a lot of 'take my survey' requests. Their mods talked to our mods and we said to go ahead and send them over! So we've been helping make their subreddit a little better by hopefully taking some of the surveys off of their front page

&gt;&gt;phaelyn:  There isn't one set purpose with SampleSize

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;Calypsee:  Good question. I was initially going to blather on about upvote/downvote/self moderating subreddit bull, and try to give constructive feedback to the survey writer. Of course, I am by no means perfect, as I quickly learned during my go at making a subreddit survey of the week! I hope that answers that question.

&gt;&gt;phaelyn:  At the moment, we all make a point of answering questions and helping out survey-makers. Being a sub of this size, we don't have to worry about hundreds of surveys asking ""DO YOU LIKE TURTLES"" coming in every hour, so our policy right now works pretty well, in my opinion.

&gt;What's your vision for this subreddit? Where will this place be in a year and what do you need for that to happen?

&gt;&gt;Cal:  A year? Jeez, I'd plan on having like, at least a few more subscribers. Maybe some of our subscribers now will have children and make them a reddit account and subscribe them to it. Seriously though, I think in a year, what with all our subreddit surveys of the week going on we will have gained quite a following of people. In a year, I hope that we will have helped thousands and thousands of students with research they needed to graduate. Steps towards that right now are including a revamp of our sidebar now that we've been around for a bit. We've been hearing some feedback from the community and we want to act on those suggestions. I don't want to give anything away [or make any un-keepable promises], but it's going to look snazzy when we're all finished up.

&gt;&gt;phae: Well, the more accurate and more interesting the data is! I personally don't have a specific ""vision"", but I do hope we continue having a happy, responsive community here.

&gt;What do you want to say as a parting message to your subscribers and those who will be subscribing?

&gt;&gt;Cal:  Well I think firstly, you guys are awesome. I love being part of an active, but polite community. To future subscribers, we look forward to having you as a part of our community as well. I don't mean to sound unwelcoming or anything, but since we do host quite a number of real research surveys, we would really not appreciate trolls around. We haven't had any yet [don't tell them!] but I think it would be easiest for everybody if we kept it that way. We the mods have dealt with trolled survey results before and its a headache we would wish on nobody, especially those doing thesis research. And fortunately, we have a huge mod team for our little place

&gt;&gt;phae:  Thanks so much for the interview and feature. SampleSize is such a fun sub to participate in for me -- it's cool to answer surveys and see the results, try answering a few questions. We'd love to have you here, though!

Thank you Calypsee &amp; phaelyn for hooking us up with the best darn interview I've seen in a long time!!  I love it when mods are willing to go long form.  Iggytoad will be here shortly to explain [redditsurveys.com](http://www.redditsurveys.com)

Hola readers

Subredditoftheday is a really decent creative writing project that's currently in need of writers (moderators). Quite simply, we field questions in the comment section. Simply (and humbly) stated, we bring the awesome.  I'm hoping you're familiar with our work.

If you're interested in joining us, and come up with a saucy submission. As creative, strange, humourous as you want to be. 

What's required? Honestly, and if you see it as a job or obligation, it'll suck!

Who are we looking for?  People who love reddit

Who should walk away?  Jerks, that might not work out either.  If you can't meet deadlines, got tons of stuff pulling you in different directions... we'll just drag you down.

If you're still interested, and if you're still interested, please message me.  I'll dig into your comment history and hopefully we can talk about getting you on board. Oh yeah, no nasty people.  

If you have any questions or comments that others could benefit from

Before you start with that nonsense about how Gays aren't awesome let me ~~straighten~~ bend you out. [Tell me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Bcy3i2RmFSk#t=70s)

Speaking of awesome, Geoff Downes, and drummer Carl Palmer. How this has anything to do with homosexuality is beyond me but we're going to figure it out together!~~^^1 Asia is something like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg). I live in Asia. I'm [not Asian](http://i.imgur.com/l3Xyq.jpg) and [I'm Not Gay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEj7JmwwLe0) but I've got a laptop and a fast Internet connection and I can make a fool of myself with 1,000 words or less so here's what you need to know: this subreddit takes [gay](http://jjie.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LGBT-flag.jpeg) and puts it with [Asian](http://i.imgur.com/DNmFE.jpg) and gives you The Gaysian^TM. Why are you complaining? *What more do you want?* You're probably one of those people that [gets mad at their mom because she got you an iPad 2 instead of an iPhone 5 for Christmas.](https://twitter.com/movetotherhythm/status/283478949705691137) It's free, it comes with love, just be happy that you have someone who loves you enough to get you *anything*.

Speaking of love

I sat down with the moderators of /r/gaysian to learn more about their community.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;##1. How did this subreddit come about?

&gt;&gt;    **/u/deus0**    The sub is fairly new - /u/machinesoflovinggrace is actually the original creator, the groupme, tinychat, etc.) I can't say too much about our origins before that, but we've seen a phenomenal response since with nearly 50% growth in subscriptions and [10x the traffic over the course of a month since the revamp](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaysian/comments/145id0/so_i_wont_strip_for_you_guys_but_look_at_how_much/)

&gt;&gt;    There seems to be a fairly large gay asian presence on reddit

&gt;##2. Where did the idea for the weekly post themes come from?

&gt;&gt;    **/u/deus0**    I've taken direct inspiration from /r/gaybros - which is an absolutely awesome subreddit for those of you that don't know about it. The themes that we have currently are as follows: Intro Mondays, Foreplay Thursday (we share naughty pics and vids :x), and Issue Friday (debates).

&gt;&gt;    I really wanted theme posts for the sub to increase engagement

&gt;&gt;    http://www.reddit.com/r/gaysian/comments/13slcc/intro_monday_its_our_first_time_be_gentle/

&gt;&gt;    http://www.reddit.com/r/gaysian/comments/153igc/ama_wednesday_i_am_your_mod_ama/

&gt;&gt;    I've taken trips around the country to personally meet members

&gt;##3. You have a very tight-knit and engaging community but you are also growing so do you think you'll be able to keep that engagement as you grow larger? Are you happy with it

&gt;&gt;    **/u/deus0**    The GroupMe (SMS Chat) is an excellent way of talking about this. For those of you that don't know GroupMe is a reply-all group text messaging service that allows people in the group to chat via text or web. That means that our members are connected to the community 24/7 and constantly get notifications whenever a member replies on the group (they can of course mute and unmute). You can imagine the worries I had regarding scale if it grew too quickly. Well, with people chiming in when they want but everyone still in the loop (things seem to self-correct) - the GroupMe and the features like it will be essential when we scale out. I can't imagine the sub being as active or tight-knit without features of the sub like it.

&gt;&gt;    My #1 priority as mod is to make the members of the sub feel like they are part of an intimate and tight-knit community

&gt;##4. This subreddit isn't just for gay people nor is it just for Asian people so what do you think is the actual make up? Are most people gay or are most people Asian or do you even know or care?

&gt;&gt;    **/u/deus0**    Right now, one of the main goals I have for this community is to build awareness of the unique culture that we share, and having people become part of that community even if they aren't in that group is absolutely *essential*. We also have a lot of fun watching movies, playing games, doing AMAs and such that everyone can join in!

&gt;##5. You are likely to get a few new users from SROTD so is there anything you would like to say to anyone who might join in?

&gt;&gt;    **/u/deus0**    Please subscribe and introduce yourself (just follow our sidebar)! We absolutely love new members from all backgrounds and are a very very welcoming group of people :) Even if you're not gay or asian or neither, the GroupMe chat is always fun, and our members tend to be particularly good looking :) In addition, one of our goals is to build awareness of an often overlooked community, so having people from any background is absolutely essential for us - we'd be so happy to have you!

&gt;##6. Do you have anything you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt;    **/u/deus0**    It's such an honor to be SROTD on the New Year! We're really just getting our footing together

Happy New Year.

When this subreddit was first suggested to us

And then I was like [meh](http://i.imgur.com/hDZn4.gif).

And now I'm all like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0XB5v.gif).

Turns out

So

The cool thing about this sub: reposts are welcome. Which makes sense since a single gif can be be appropriate for many situations. So

So today's interview is short. I don't think the mods like using words, no one on reddit is going to make a username and pretend to be someone famous. No one lies on the internet like that).

&gt;##1. How do you feel right now?

&gt;&gt; [I feel a bit like this](http://i.imgur.com/MN5ug.gif)


&gt;##2. How did this sub start and how did that make you feel?


&gt;&gt; hotcarl7379 started it when he noticed that a lot of gifs are posted with the tag ""HIFW""


&gt;##3. How does being a moderator make you feel?

&gt;&gt; Being a moderator makes me feel like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HIFW/top/)


&gt;##4. Enough with the feel good questions. What is (are) your favorite HIFW gif(s)?

*A youtube haiku is ""any almost poetic video under 14 seconds."" They are usually funny and a little weird.*

Today’s featured sub, and what it is best at. Of course if you look for it you can find acres and acres of discussion and meta discussion and discussion about the meta discussion, but without things like youtube haiku that discussion just wouldn’t function. You can’t make a bunch of people sit in the same place and just “discuss”. It won’t happen. Try it with your friends some day; ring them up and say ”yo dawgs, we’re all gona meet up in this room and just chat”. They’ll be like “sounds cool, G - Ill bring the brews” and you’ll be all “no homes: no brews, just chat”. They’ll say “uh, ok. Ill bring over a large suitcase of that rank dank and we can cook it up into some delicious home-made icecream! Shit is the bomb”. And you’ll say “nope, or twice

To avoid this sorry situation, actual real-life people are unlikely to want to come all the way your house *just* to browse /r/youtube haiku (although throw in some weed-infused desert products and you’ve got yourself a stew, socially speaking), but they will come all the way from their bedrooms to the frontpage of reddit, and with them bring all the secondary internomic benefits that we take so for granted (such as posts and subscribers for /r/subredditoftheday!).

&gt;## How do you find them? Any tips for aspiring haiku collectors?

&gt;&gt;Well, it's really hard finding Haiku because of the very short length requirements. It really makes actually discovering one feel like finding 5 dollars in your pants after you've washed them, or something equally as rare (maybe cookies in your packed lunch, I dunno). I feel like it takes some real work to find gems like these, and not everyone will agree with you that it's good Haiku either. Sometimes I search Youtube for generic terms like ""serious"" or ""dog running"" or ""fart baby"", but that can be a lot like fishing with dynamite. 


&gt;## Do you write Haiku?

&gt;&gt; I used to write Haiku


&gt;## What's so great about /r/youtubehaiku? Why should everyone subscribe?

&gt;&gt; The thing that really seems to grab people is how unique the Youtube Haiku are. They can be funny or serious, or are as fascinated by these phenomenon as we are.

In the beginning, a post appeared.

And it was a meme we heard yesterday.

/r/RedditThroughHistory explores the idea that we could have accessed Reddit at different posts in history. Did that Chieftain just steal your best Sabretooth hide? Hear about this great new record that just came out? Did these two weird bicycle shop kids try flying off a cliff? Whatever point in time you might have been from

The masters of the historical arts in this domain are ModernSociety, and have a light tea chat with them.


&gt;For those who haven't traveled in time yet

&gt;&gt;**ModernSociety:** Imagine a world where time travelling exists. Pretty awesome

&gt;&gt;**KennyLog-in:** A place to pretend that we are redditing in response to historical events as if they are just happening.

&gt;When did you start moderating this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**ModernSociety:** I founded it

&gt;&gt;**KennyLog-in:** A short time after it was created.

&gt;What kind of posts do you most often see?

&gt;&gt;**ModernSociety:** Lots of pictures and Wikipedia articles. They're usually really interesting

&gt;&gt;**KennyLog-in:** The same sort of posts you see on reddit... 'guess who I ran into, which IMO are really more myth than history.

&gt;What's your favorite period of time?

&gt;&gt;**ModernSociety:** Ancient Rome and Greece are awesome. Aqueducts

&gt;&gt;**KennyLog-in:** I personally enjoy early modern European history

&gt;If you could have dinner with a famous Redditor

&gt;&gt;**ModernSociety:** Hmm

&gt;&gt;**KennyLog-in:** I did have a meal with a famous redditor. *(He didn't message me a follow-up on who it was! D:)

&gt;Anything you'd like to say to your current subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**ModernSociety:** Thanks for the great mix of entertainment and education value! (Pretend I said that in Latin)

&gt;&gt;**KennyLog-in:** Thank you for your interest and go study your history so you can submit some more. :)

No one walks into a doctor's office and says

Nope. You go in because your throat is sore or your back aches or because something else isn't *quite right*. You never think that *cancer* is a possibility until your doctor tells you, everything changes.

We've all known someone who has suffered the horror of the Big C, your world is rocked. It's no longer something that happens to *other people*. It's no longer some strange, foreign, abstract idea. It becomes something that is real, and *evil*, and malicious... and it's on your doorstep.

I don't have cancer. I'm lucky like that... so far. But like the majority of us, and even people I don't really like all that much. And I hate the motherfucker.

Why? Because cancer is a douchebag. It refuses to behave like a gentleman. Instead of boldly declaring its intent to kill you or challenge you to a proper duel it sneaks up on you. It'll mess around with curious lumps, that sort of thing. But its symptoms aren't usually enough to prompt you to visit a doctor right away. Unlike an aneurism or a heart attack (other cruel enemies, to be sure), cancer isn't classy enough to simply do the deed. No, cancer likes to draw things out. To torture you. To maximize your pain and discomfort as long as possible.

It's insidious. It's cruel. And it's undeserving of any respect.

Thankfully, we have a fighting chance to turn the tables. Cancer is a brutal monster but at least we have the capacity, as a species, to combat it now. It's usually a long, protracted war but  *every single day* we learn more about how to defeat it: with new technology, new medicines, new surgeries

Even so

Another way to put that

Which brings me to today's featured subreddit: /r/fuckcancer. It's a place for people to vent; to unleash their frustrations about this cowardly disease

Just the other night I sent the sole moderator of /r/fuckcancer

***

&gt;I know you're a busy man which explains why your subreddit hasn't had a lot of customization/promotion. You're also its only moderator

&gt;&gt;I'd welcome an additional mod(s) - it's not exactly difficult

&gt;Fuck Cancer. Hm. This /r/ isn't some kind of ""Rule 34"" thing

&gt;&gt;Nope. It's about being angry at something that hurts loved ones. It's about trying to put a face on that which has none, middle-aged folks, all races - cancer fucks everyone, and I want to fuck it back. I yearn for the day in my lifetime that we finally can kick cancer to the curb like the little bitch that it is. I'll cry for my dead mother and tell her how close she was to being around for the cure, and that we - as a species - finally did it.

&gt;Some people might think that your /r/ is akin to shouting at the windmill. How would you respond to such an accusation?

&gt;&gt;Those people can go back to /r/circlejerk. :-) Just because shouting at a windmill may not change the direction of the windmill

&gt;Do you have any inspiring words you'd like to share with anyone dealing with cancer right now? Besides ""fuck cancer""

&gt;&gt;Cancer does not own you. Cancer does not define you. It does not define the person with the disease or the family, CANCER and knowing that others support us in this. /r/fuckcancer is about the shouting, but its also about knowing that there are others who are also angry and also are going through the same pain. Knowing that is really what /r/fuckcancer is about.

&gt;&gt;You aren't alone.

&gt;&gt;Be angry when it is time to be angry. Be supportive of your loved ones with the disease. Cry. Shout. Laugh. Find strength in knowing you are not alone.

It's about time you did something with all those pictures you took.  No, but never did anything with them.  It's okay.  We all do it from time to time.  Give it a try and share it with reddit.  Let us see the pictures you've taken.  You must be proud of at least one, right?  You might even get some helpful tips and become a better photographer for it.

Mod [noroom](/user/noroom) sat down with me to answer a few questions.

&gt;##What prompted you to start
&gt;&gt;When I created itookapicture, so I created this subreddit in hopes that it would help me and others with that problem. Also because it's nice to look at pretty pictures.

&gt;##What kinds of pictures do people take? Notice any patterns of popular photos?
&gt;&gt;I think it's mainly because of reddit's audience, but I think many amateur photographers will practice on their pets, and this is just a reflection of that. Some pet pictures do turn out quite good, though.

&gt;##What advice would you give to someone with a camera?
&gt;&gt;If you're just starting out, because practice makes perfect. If you're more experienced, then try stepping out of your comfort zone and do some photography you've never done before. Regardless of your level of experience, tro to take your camera with you whenever you go somewhere you've never been before.

&gt;##What are the more interesting or unique pictures that have been taken? What about favorites?
&gt;&gt;I never thought of keeping a list of the pictures I've enjoyed the most
[A cup of bokeh](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/i882c/itap_of_a_cup_of_bokeh/)
[A homeless dog in Tibet](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/l233g/itap_of_a_homeless_dog_in_tibet/)
[Water](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/iezya/itap_of_water/)
[A spider in my parking garage](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/k6c0n/itap_of_a_spider_in_my_parking_garage/)
[Clouds](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/kq42g/clouds/)

&gt;&gt;We do get wonderful submissions every day

&gt;##How would you suggest people get ideas for pictures?
&gt;&gt;It's a common problem in the hobbyist community. We have partnered up with some similar subreddits in hopes that our subscribers find further inspiration. Try to participate in challenges or contests. Decide on a topic

&gt;##Any final words of encouragement or tips for the picture-takers out there?
&gt;&gt;Try to get feedback from other photographers you can talk face-to-face. My experience with internet communities has taught me that large, expert feedback. For most of us, though, it's still the best way to reach a lot of people with similar interests as ours. And we'll try our best to help you out with your photography.

Last week, these rowdy bunch of misfits (Actually these redditors are the nicest I've seen anywhere excluding the mods over here &amp; [SWFPN](/r/pornoverlords.)) just love seating in front of the tube and going on epic quests to save the ~~princess, opps thats mario.~~ country, kingdom, world, gallaxy, universe... you get the point.

RPG video games have come a long, it was called [imaginations](http://i.imgur.com/ZhwOI.gif). All they needed were symbols representing characters and it would be enough to convey the story across. With some crazy [midi beats](/r/gamemusic ""this is always another great sub-reddit."") you had a recipe for some good times.

Today's games aren't bad

I wanted to mention that there are two main types of video game RPGs, [r/Jrpg](/r/Jrpg) is pretty decent. But for those who love all kinds of RPGs, [r/rpg_gamers](/r/RPG_gamers) is my early Christmas / Hanukkah / Kwanzaa / [Festivus for the rest of us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS7-jcsB_WQ) present to you. Now the interview, be sure to answer the same questions I asked **Lucavious** the creator and top mod of r/rpg_gamers in the comments!

&gt; ## When you created RPG_gamers

&gt;&gt; I just wanted to sign up for an RPG subreddit. I figured for a genre as broad and popular as RPGs there had to already be something popular out there. Surprisingly the answer was no

&gt; ## Top 10 RPGs.

&gt;&gt;1. Final Fantasy VI
1. Chrono Trigger
1. Disgaea
1. Mother 2 or 3
1. Lufia II
1. Kingdom Hearts
1. Diablo II
1. Secret of Mana
1. Final Fantasy Tactics
1. Mario RPG

&gt; ## What was that one moment when you realized

&gt;&gt; I used to go play at a neighbor's house across the street

&gt; ## If you could remake any one RPG which one would it be and why? What would you do differently?
&gt;&gt; I'd love to see [Lufia II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals) get some real justice as a remade game. There was a Nintendo DS remake a while back but they killed the combat system and turned it into an action game that didn't share a lot of similarities to the original. It's a crime that not every fan of RPGs isn't made to play through that game. Excellent story
&gt; ## Tell us about your community

&gt;&gt; Thanks &lt;3

&gt;&gt;The one thing I didn't expect when this community started growing was how friendly everyone would be to eachother. I'm used to the bigger communities where saying the wrong thing (which I do a lot) gets you downvoted to hell or making a boring topic results in nobody reading it. It seems like even the most boring topics get at least 10 upvotes in a given day and god help you if you need a game recommendation; those topics just explode with about 100+ fans wanting to get you into the right game.

&gt; ## Anything you liked to add?

&gt;&gt; Not a lot. It's funny that I've started other little projects and community things before for things I really wanted to grow (fansites for other games) and they always landed flat on their faces. With [r/RPG_Gamers](/r/RPG_gamers) it just took off from day one with nothing but support for every person who visited. Even reddit.com was awesome about getting it sponsored on the right bar when we made a simple request. I think RPG gamers in general just feel a lot closer than most other game genres and connect more easily.",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/m78n4/november_10_2011_rrpg_gamers_its_dangerous_out/

IWantToLearn is meant to help people who are looking for help starting a major project or learning a new skill.  I recently wanted help learning to play the guitar.  I've played for years and thought reddit would probably have a lot of resources for me to use to improve my skills so I did a search.  I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/bcp7j/iwtl_how_to_play_guitar/).  Since finding the subreddit I have found a lot of things I'd like to do that I never realized I wanted to do before. Check [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/e36i9/iwtl_lets_make_a_list_of_frequentlyrequestedtopics/) for their frequently requested topics.  This is one of my ""go-to"" subs when I'm looking for a good read.  I advise the ones of you who are interested in learning something new everyday go check it out.  You won't regret it!


So let's celebrate this subreddit!  /IWantToLearn is **AWESOME**!!










##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

IWantToLearn (IWTL) came from my own desire to learn a martial art. It was a bit of a passing thought, which seems to traditionally have a lot of mind share, and friends who have been involved with other martial arts, but I never knew which way would be right for me and my goals.

I thought that one way to solve my problem would be to reach out to the reddit community and see what their thoughts were on the subject, and I abstracted my specific question into a more generalized ""How do I do &lt;x&gt;?"" and realized that, like DoesAnybodyElse, this could be a whole class of AskReddit questions which is better served by having a dedicated subreddit.

One criticism I've repeatedly seen for IWTL is the idea that all this information is already out there, or you'll find something like the loads of programming blogs which mean well, but can contain subtle errors which can lead a young developer down a very wrong path to internalizing some very bad habits.

Searching on Google for information on a subject seems like an odd way to learn a new topic, leaving you prone to missing large chunks of a subject. By contrast, declaring on a reddit submission, ""I want to learn how to &lt;x&gt;, and this is where I am in terms of finding my way"" seems like a great way to find gaps in your knowledge. You're allowing the community to tell you how they learned the subject, they can educate you on areas of interest you may not have known existed, and they can warn you about various fallacies and other pitfalls you might run into. These people have the benefit of having once been in your shoes

So that's how IWTL was born; I'll leave it to xtirpation to fill you in on more of the day-to-day stuff, but I think xtirpation has his finger on the pulse of the subreddit moreso than I do.


##xtirpation##
=======================================================================


IWTL really doesn't need much moderation. From time to time we'll see comments mocking a poster's question and those are generally the ones I'll remove to uphold the idea that there's no such thing as a dumb question. Other than that

We're starting to see more and more variation in topics that Redditors want to learn, it seems like someone out there has at least some expertise and can point in the right direction to get people started. Among the favourites that Redditors like to learn are languages, programming, and musical instruments.



##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

I think my martial arts IWTL was the first submission ever posted there. It actually has a disclaimer at the top of it saying that I was using it as a sample question. I think that I got some pretty good advice in that thread

There have been a few interesting IWTLs that I've followed

We had another one - I don't think it was that long ago - asking how to properly roll Rs. That one was interesting because apparently there are actually two different ways that people produce an R sound, I did learn why I'm so hopelessly incompetent at it.

As far as having a pulse on the subreddit, so I don't find myself watching the place very closely. I don't know how common the feeling is among mods of other reddits, but I've always felt vaguely guilty about not being overly active in that respect. I spend time there, sure, but it feels like I should be doing more somehow.

I think we're much too varied a subreddit to have a consistent feel. IWTL deals with a wide range of topics, and I've been surprised at the breadth of knowledge our subscribers display. Even on really obscure topics, you'll still typically get a few really good answers. It's really cool.


##xtirpation##
=======================================================================

The one thing I learned that really sticks out in my memory is Ruby on Rails. I'd always wanted to try the language out

I find myself learning things (not in depth

As for the pulse of the subreddit, otherwise if people downvoted things they didn't want to learn, or if they downvoted topics just because they were ""stupid"", we wouldn't have nearly as many interesting comments and replies.

I think the one thing that embodies the subreddit is a general sense of curiosity. Certainly people don't frontpage us because they constantly have things they want to ask/learn. It's more likely that people want to see what they can learn

Sorry 'bout the late reply



##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

Just to touch on the upvote/downvote stuff that xtirpation mentioned

As the sub grew, any new post can hit the top of the page, even if it's been downvoted). We now have two systems in place to discourage downvoting. First, if you hover over the downvote button, a little tooltip pops up and asks you to think it over first, and that others are entitled to ask what they want. Second, we don't display downvote counts on submissions. Where a post would usually display the vote total, and the downvote total for a submission, ""20 people like this"". I think de-emphasizing the downvote total very subtley suggests that downvotes are very much frowned upon outside of certain extreme circumstances.",t5_2sgno

Long exposure photographs are produced by increasing the length that the camera's shutter is open, low light scenarios and car tail-lights are all fascinating subjects to be captured with a camera over the course of 15-30 seconds given the unique effects they leave behind on long exposure shots. 

Amassing 2k+ subscribers in only a month, and most to all is received with constructive criticism.

***NOW FOR A TRIVIAL STORY FROM MY LIFE!***

---



*Earlier this evening I went to a coffee shop with a friend. I began eavesdropping on a conversation from the table next to me.* 

*The table comprised of 3 seemingly younger students

*They were discussing, specifically jump-starting an acting career. From the way the older mentor figure spoke, it seemed like he was some sort of talent scout or agent, but I couldn't be sure.* 

*The strangest part about this meeting was the way the mentor/agent conducted himself. His voice was loud and booming, though I haven't met any actual talet scouts, so what do I know?*

*He spoke with a pompous that seemed forced

*I am not saying that this man didn't have the ability to make good on these promises, as he so often mentioned, why was he in my west texas town? Sadly my questions would go unanswered.*

*After sometime I saw that he was losing one of the girls interest. She waned and hardly participated in conversation. He then began offering the gifts that would help their acting career and vowed to take these fairly unconventional looking high-schoolers to the big time.* 

*There was talk of money and payment


*My mind began creating stories about who this man was

*Did they answer one of his sketchy looking ads on craigslist promising acting positions with generous compensations only to be duped into staring in a gangbang porno? He did look a little slimy; slimy enough to be a porn director


Regardless of who this man what, without them knowing you know is both exhilarating and relatively harmless.

Charlie and the '98 Buick Century - My lesson in the art of trading.

Two days ago I had the pleasure of meeting Charley Russell, two teeth and the heart of a redditor.  See, recently I bought a used minivan because after 182,000 miles our family car was just begging to be set free.  Much like Enzo in Garth Stein's *The Art of Racing in the Rain*, it's time had come.   Sadly, my limited knowledge of cars bit me in the hiney when I learned that the recently acquired van's motor was less than stellar.  And I learned this in the parking lot at the grocery store when this gentleman (who may or may not have been release on his own recognizance), approaches me saying, you got something wrong with your motor!""  

Now as a member of the reddit community, Charlie and I get into it.  He's all water pump this and alternator that, and I'm all tetanus shot this and purell that, but at the end of our discourse, Charlie give me his business card and says, ""look, I never want to see you stranded with a broken down vehicle.  If this ever breaks down, his business card?  Xtreme Towing Inc.

Smash cut, on my return home, an hour from our house the car completely dies and I'm forced to abandon it on the side of a major country highway.  When it happened I ran to the front of the car and gently closed imaginary eyelids over the headlights.  Time of death, Saturday.

This morning I called up Charlie of Xtreme Towing to see if he can get his truck out there to pick up the body.  I told him about our broken down car, if you can get it, and fix it, it's yours.  You can junk it for a hundred dollars, I don't care, but I need someone to take this car off the highway!""  Six hours after that, Charlie called me up to say, fixed it and she's running like a top!  I never told you but I don't actually own a tow truck or a car for that matter.  Someday I will though

That was my most recent lesson in trading, and I got piece of mind knowing that the new owner can enjoy the car and fix any problem that may arise in the future.  I also got cool friend with two first names!

Today's subreddit deals with trading Steam games.  Much like Steely Dan, be a good person, get to heaven, repeat.  I really like this place.  It's a very active community, the mods are crazy busy with their involvement, but the best part is that everyone's way busy helping out others - they've got 2 to 10 times the amount of posts compared to most subreddits we feature!  

There's so much activity at [/r/SteamGameSwap](/r/SteamGameSwap) it's almost intimidating.  Here to make us feel at home are two fantastic moderators

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;xSKASx:  Steam Game Swap is a subreddit where you can find and offer trades on Reddit. Users can make their own posts or offer on ones that are already made. Ever since trading has come out on steam, alike the mushroom system in /r/gameswap.

&gt;&gt;blueshiftlabs:  SGS is a place to trade PC digital games, they can go on Steam and do the trade. We're essentially the PC gaming counterpart of /r/gameswap, which tends to have a console and physical-game focus.

&gt;What are the rules governing swapping? What if I wanted to sit back in my boxer briefs collecting steam games while shouting

&gt;&gt;bsl: Rules are laid out in the sidebar

- Users who want to trade make a post

- Other users respond if they're interested.

- Some things are banned entirely

- Once you've completed a trade

- Getting to higher tiers of flair means the community can probably trust you

&gt;&gt;SKAS:  Rules have always been changing for good or bad, but if you have traded in the past then you can trade and offer game codes, or keys. Other rules are such things like one post per day, restrictions on trading, etc.

&gt;What advice would you give to someone who wants to join your community for the first time? Can they call you at home with their questions?

&gt;&gt;bsl:  The biggest thing for new users is read the sidebar

&gt;&gt;Other than that

&gt;&gt;SKAS:  My advice would be to look at what games you have, then contact that person. There's nothing special to it and it's easy as pie.

&gt;Tell me

&gt;&gt;SKAS:  We generally get a lot of posts a day. Dedicated users come back to make their trades and it's nice to see that.

&gt;&gt;bsl:  Many posts. Hard to put an exact number on things

&gt;There's several steam trading subreddits

&gt;&gt;bsl:  There are several Steam trading subreddits, showing as much or more enthusiasm for SGS as they did for their own communities.

&gt;&gt;SKAS:  We like to make our users feel like they are trading in a good and safe place. Fortunately we haven't had too many scamming encounters or unfair users

&gt;Is there anything I didn't ask? Info that needs to be passed along so redditors can better understand /r/SteamGameSwap?

&gt;&gt;bsl:  If something's broken with the CSS or anything else
If you have suggestions

&gt;&gt;SKAS:  The mods are always here to help. We love to take your suggestions and try to make the subreddit fair to everyone. Also,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,t3_qi3m6

*The Cleveland Symphony Orchestra was rehearsing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. There is an extensive section where the bass players don't play for twenty minutes of so. One of them decided that, head to the bar for a few, and then return when they were about to play. It seemed like a good idea at the time.*

*This idea was met with great approval, to loosen up. Fifteen minutes and a few rounds later, one of the bass players said, ""Shouldn't we be heading back? It's almost time!""*

You know what the second most important thing is George Michael?  No not lunch... friendship!  Friendship is what baseball is all about, the mods have created a place that is welcoming, un-intimidating, and ~~totally~~ mostly harmonious.  Even if you're slightly interested in baseball, you have to come here and check out the posts, read the comments and bathe, nay

The second thing you'll immediately become aware of is the amount of effort the mod team puts in to make this place excellent.  As a mod here at subreddit of the day, my new friend explain it all to you.  He moderates at /r/baseball when he's not working with kids who have autism of the aids.  Take it away dtardif!


&gt;Please tell us what we'll find at /r/baseball.

&gt;&gt;/r/baseball is abuzz right now with the World Series at our doorstep. You will find our community to be some of the better versed baseball fans in Sabermetrics (the study of statistics in relation to baseball), argue about postseason and preseason prediction, and generally discuss the virtues of baseball. It serves as a forum to both discuss the MLB and for people who play the game or want to discuss the rules of the game. All are welcome.

&gt;Goddamnit you write well.  Okay

&gt;&gt;/r/baseball features logos and flair, which are shown at the top of /r/baseball, and many of which are very active and attractive looking.

&gt;&gt;We also have a user-suggested reading list on the right hand side, /r/cardgallery, /r/fantasybaseball and /r/ballparks. Finally, we have a user-run twitter feed of the posts on /r/baseball.

&gt;Regarding the World Series

&gt;&gt;The World Series this year is great fun. The favored Phillies and Yankees got knocked out of the series early, and who have seemingly willed their way into the World Series. Is it a repeat of [2006](http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2006_WS.shtml), or is it the dawn of a dynasty for [Nolan Ryan's Rangers](http://espn.go.com/dallas/mlb/story/_/id/7116409/nolan-ryan-texas-rangers-beat-st-louis-cardinals-six-games)?

&gt;Baseball is easily the most criticized professional sport. I won't go into the remarks

&gt;&gt;Baseball is one of the most criticized sports, as a child, I didn't even really like baseball, but part of that is because I lacked the appreciation for the subtlety of the sport. [American] Football seems boring to those who don't understand the intricacies of a play unfolding on the field, for instance.

&gt;&gt;Baseball is steeped in statistics due to the fact that it is the most discrete sport played in America. As a mathematician

&gt;&gt;Baseball also has a very rich metagame between the pitcher and a hitter. Learning to recognize pitch types greatly improves one's enjoyment of the sport, and the mental game between a pitcher and a hitter is easy to miss as a casual fan. A pitcher will seemingly throw two straight curveball ""bad"" balls off the plate and low to a hitter which bounce at the plate, but his intent is to fool the hitter, and the next pitch is a high strike inside. The batter is used to seeing a slow pitch away, and it's really tough to lay off of the high heat, and he desperation swings and pops up the ball to the infield. This wasn't luck, it was scouting, it was the pitcher fooling the hitter and messing with his timing.

&gt;&gt;Even the ""boring"" seconds between when a pitcher is set and throwing is time meant to throw the hitter off. Every look into first is to fool the runner, every defensive alignment to challenge a one trick lefty hitter into trying to go opposite field while pitching him inside the whole time... everything is subtle, all of the waits create very exciting tension, and everything has meaning. It seems like a boring game of catch where you wait for any hitter to hit a home run for excitement, but I promise you that it's a very deep game with a metagame that keeps me coming back.

** 1

I'll be honest with you. The only thing I know about algae is that when you have a fish tank, it can't be all that boring. There has to be something interesting about plants."" Nope. The class made me, if possible, even more turned off to the idea of plants. Actually, the only thing I learned from that class was that all plants today evolved from red algae...I think. Who knows, I may have even gotten that wrong.

But then this subreddit fell into my lap yesterday morning. Due to a momentary panic, but I don't know shit about algae."" No, I didn't have some magical burst of knowledge where I suddenly became so interested in algae that it was the most interesting shit in the world. But I did have a chance to look at the subreddit and talk to the mods about the art of growing aquatic plants. And it did spark my interest. Probably because there is just [so much science behind it.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsbl00sI1s1qmxh4mo1_500.png). It's a small community, but what they lack in subscribers, they make up in [contests](http://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/ypajz/rplantedtanks_monthly_photo_contest_announcement/), a very chill environment, and an extremely awesome group of mods.



&gt;##1. What is /r/PlantedTank?

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme** A community for all aquatic plant enthusiasts

&gt;&gt;**goots**/r/PlantedTank is a forum dedicated to the growing hobby of starting and maintaining an aquarium with real plants. This hobby blends aspects of chemistry, and fishkeeping in a way that highlights the aesthetics of nature and the importance of a stable ecosystem -- and puts in on display in your living room! [Takashi Amano](http://fish.mongabay.com/images/bigtank.jpg) is a huge celebrity within our hobby.

&gt;##2. Why grow ~~algae~~ aquatic plants and not a flower?

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme** You can't keep fish in a flower pot! Terrestrial plants are awesome

&gt;&gt;**goots**This question made me laugh. The bane of our hobby is algae. When the environmental balance of an aquarium is out-of-whack, as it can overrun a beautiful tank. The term ""Algae-Growers"" is a tongue-in-cheek way of admitting that we're always learning, no matter how long we've participated in this hobby.

&gt;##3. What are the benefits of growing ~~algae~~ aquatic plants?

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme**For one, we love our aquatic gardens. They bring us a sense of accomplishment and for some use, a strong feeling of peace. It can be a very relaxing or stressful hobby, depending on how you look it. In any light, it’s a fun challenge.

&gt;&gt;**goots**Since the whole ""algae"" thing threw you off (haha), and they provide great habitats for our fish! One of the most important tasks in keeping a pet, no matter if it's a cat, dog, or fish, is making sure that it has the correct environment to thrive. Keeping live plants helps in this endeavor.

&gt;##4. What can we find in this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme**Helpful tips and starter guides, weekly journal updates, and all manner of advice and support from people literally all over the world, with all different type of tanks, fish, and plants. Also, some very colorful characters with mod privileges. :D

&gt;&gt;**goots**Since there's *so much* to learn about keeping a planted tank, and answers to questions that may be hard to find just by googling. Also, since we're starting to pick up a lot of new members, we've already been able to establish partnerships with online vendors.

&gt;##5. Let's see your plant!

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme** [This is my planted tank!](http://i.imgur.com/3vLAX.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**goots**Here are old shots of my [55 gallon](http://i.imgur.com/D2O7V.jpg) tank and [4 gallon tank](http://i.imgur.com/0W9Zq.jpg). I am by no means an expert yet

&gt;##6. What's your favorite thing about this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme** The community, it’s all here.

&gt;&gt;**goots** Personally

&gt;##7. So I hear you have a Canadian on the mod team

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme**I find that Mr. Whale, but he's quite charming if I do say so myself. I love his [beady little eyes.](http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/50495_123956090950671_6946537_n.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**goots**He is a wonderful addition to the team

&gt;##8. Anything else you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;**slidewithme**The mods are actively trying to grow the community, feel proud to have been made a leader among them by goots.

&gt;&gt;**goots** Anybody who said, feel free to join us! It's really not a cult, we swear. (That's what we tell all the new cult members)

&gt;&gt;Also, and we'd love for you to be a part of it.


It was a huge pleasure working with you mods.

Parallel Dimension Title: To boldly go where no fact has ever gone before.

[*Its /r/AskScience but with imagination.*](http://i.imgur.com/iCvQN.jpg)

**501** guys who love saying... What if; For **6** brilliant months.

Have you ever wondered who would win in a battle to the death

I've personally fallen in love with /r/AskScienceFiction. It has all the charm of a well groomed nobleman yet brains of a genius gone mad/rogue. Here is the delightful interview with the one man show mod himself  **avsa**.

Before the interview I would like to mention

&gt;## 1. How did r/AskScienceFiction start? Who was the brainchild behind it?

&gt;&gt; My favorite reddit is by far /r/AskScience… er.. just after /r/SubRedditOfTheDay of course!.. The best questions on AskScience are usually the very speculative ones, hoping that if a real expert in the field chimed in, he could correct anything you said and add to it: you felt you were helping by adding anything. But as the community grew, real scientists were more common and layman speculation started being more work than helping anyone, you did a lot better for the community if you just shut up and read.

&gt;&gt; Then I asked myself: what if there was a place that you could take layman speculation to extreme? Where actually real world knowledge wasn't actually a requirement? Therefore: /r/askScienceFiction [was born].

&gt;## 2. With all that nerd cred on the line

&gt;&gt; First, especially in topics like star trek and harry potter, footnote wars. Everything in a science fiction/fantasy universe is make believe, here your make believe is as good as JK Rowling's. A good example was a discussion about [if you're still yourself when you go through a tele porter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/ikm0r/do_transporters_kill_you_and_create_an_exact_copy/) It just happens that Star trek writers thought a lot about that already simply answered ""no"" because the technology works by doing X. But here, you can think more about the question and see the implications: what if a transporter is in fact just a replicator – much like a scanner + paper shredder + email + printer/fax is a tele porter for documents? It doesn't really matter that this would contradict episode N from the New generation: /r/AskScienceFiction isn't /r/startrek.

&gt;## 3. What is your favorite post so far?

&gt;&gt; My personal favorite is one I posted [defending the rights of Zombies to be treated as a living being](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/j1s0r/why_do_we_consider_zombies_as_walking_dead/) but it seems that discussing the Patent system in a universe with time travel is a popular topic as seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/l30it/whats_the_status_of_intellectual_property_in_a/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/j6rva/who_owns_the_patents_on_a_time_machine/) Spoiler: The first patent ever issued was for a time machine.

&gt;## 4. Tell us about the community

&gt;&gt; As far as I know, we're not aiming for satire posts: we want serious discussions about a silly premise. A saw an article a few years back where a scientist asked hollywood movies to have a rule where only one law of physics could be broken per movie. It's very similar to what we do: let's suspend logic and disbelieve about one single thing (say magic unicorns exist) what does this mean in a real world: do they shit rainbows? How can one efficiently excrete anything through rainbows? Is there bacteria living and composting unicorn-shit-rainbow?

&gt;&gt; Right now it's a very small community, and to let the layman speculation go wild.

&gt;## 5. Anything else you like to add?

&gt;&gt; Have you ever argued seriously about the real world implications of a silly plot hole in a movie? Then you're welcome in our tiny community! :)

There should be like... some sort of reddit alarm clock that tells me to stop redditing and like... do other non-reddit stuff. Talk about meta meta. I would never use it

You want to know where to suggest something like that? /r/IdeasForTheAdmins. Its right there in the title you guys

~~Like I mentioned before

&gt;##1. How did /r/IdeasForTheAdmins start? Whats the backstory? Whats the behind the scenes story?

&gt;&gt;**dzneill** KK started it and I've been helping out for a while.

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers** I created it when I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time hanging out in /r/AskReddit. I noticed people would suggest features a lot, but with enough promotion and the help of a handful of good people, here we are :)

&gt;##2.What are some of the craziest / nonsensical suggestion(s) made?

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers** The very first post in [/r/IFTA](/r/IdeasForTheAdmins) was ""Ban krispykrackers for insubordination."" I wish I could find the link. **Edit #1** The lovely redtaboo [found it for me!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/7luhz/ban_krispykrackers_for_insubordination/) **Edit #2** As did the charming LGBTerrific :)

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo** One that gets suggested all the time is to create tags and use those instead of reddits. Creating one thread in multiple reddits which in my mind would completely negate the community feel of subreddits. [One example here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/b2ffv/allow_submissions_to_have_multiple_subreddit_tags/)

&gt;&gt;**dzneill** Oh man

&gt;##3.What is your favorite suggestion made that was actually implemented?
&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers** Stickied boxes for self posts would have to be my favorite one that got implemented. I can't find the actual post

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo** Gotta be the toggleable (YES THAT IS NOW A WORD!) NSFW tags for posts. Great feature! Honorable mention to voting arrows in your inbox... ..that was my [idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/9m8ys/i_love_the_new_options_in_my_inbox_but_can_i_have/) :P

&gt;&gt;**dzneill** There have neen several but the most recent was when the admins included [subredditing auto-linking](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/j9zwt/) into reddit's markdown formatting. It was something I wanted to see happen for a while and numerous people had suggested it before. Another one would be when the admins increased the number of subreddits shown on your page from 50 to 100 for gold members. I actually [suggested something similar once](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/g9u72/increase_the_number_of_reddits_shown_from_50_to/). A third would be fixing the [""hide links i've liked"" preference to not hide your own links.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/d3nfc/change_to_the_dont_show_links_after_ive_liked/) This was causing a number of reports to /r/help about people not seeing any of their own links.

&gt;##4.Where do you see I4TA in the future? Or how soon can we get a direct access usb port to the Admins' heads?
&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers**  I hope it just stays civil and the admins continue tuning in.

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo** We almost had the direct port finished in jedberg's head when he took off on us. No worries though

&gt;&gt;**dzneill**  I only see good things in the future. We're steadily increasing in traffic and the great thing about the sub is that even if the admins don't have time to chime in there are lots of knowledgeable people that can debate the ideas.

&gt;&gt; Once the admins get enough people on staff to spread around the work I imagine they'll be more vocal in IFTA. They do check in on it

&gt;##5.What is your ideal reader / subscriber for I4TA? Anyone you know who can set an example?
&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers** Like dzneill said

&gt;&gt;**redtaboo** The ideal contributor who is someone able to see past what would be best for themselves as a user and what would be best for all of reddit...

&gt;&gt;**dzneill** My ideal reader is someone who is interested in reddit enough to make suggestions and debate other suggestions while remaining friendly.

&gt;&gt;Anyone with lightbulb flair is good people.

&gt;##6.Anything you'd like to add?
&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers** Nah

&gt;&gt;**dzneill**  Don't be a stranger

Do you ever randomly stop doing something and think to yourself “What would Jesus do?” Most of you probably don’t since the first thing you think of are morals, I learned that showing too much ankle attracts sex offenders. 

Anyway, I got the mods of the brilliant subreddit RaymondAblack and Jesus’s younger, but not as well known brother, J3susHChr1st.

&gt;What the hell is r/coffeewithjesus?

&gt;&gt;RaymondAblack: It's funny you use that wording. /r/CoffeeWithJesus is a subreddit that gives us Jesus's answers on everything from adultery to temptation to pickup lines. The subreddit is updated daily and we encourage others to post their own content.


&gt;What gave you the idea to start this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;RaymondAblack: The idea for /r/CoffeeWithJesus came when while talking to people in a couple subreddits


&gt;Get any hate mail from the folks over at r/christianity or related subreddits?

A community of ***3

Regardless of what you think about ""karma"", relationships with the people around us and the interactions that we share. 

Today's Subreddit of the Day embodies the empathic nature that I speak of. They have decided to make a place where people can share the common experience of being human. They have created a space where wants and needs can be addressed with simple acts of kindness from strangers. 

So


r/Randomkindness is a community where anyone can fit into and in my mind remains to be a place of mutual respect and generosity. For that I think they deserve a round of applause. 

[Avien](http://www.reddit.com/user/Avien), facts and figures about their subreddit for the questions in my interview! Please feel free to ask Him questions in the comments.

***THE INTERVIEW***

&gt;For those of us dying to know
&gt;&gt;The whole thing started with inspiration from [Random Acts of Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/). There was one case where a couple of Canadian children requested pizza. A RAOP member from Australia, which boosted our community close to the size you see today.


&gt;For those who are hesitant or new to your subreddit
&gt;&gt;First, [US], [JAPAN], [LONDON]. Then explain what you are offering or requesting in the subject. Further explanation is worked out in the details and the comments. Once it’s decided who are you giving or receiving from, exchange details through private message. Lastly, apply for our flair to show off the kindness you gave or received.



&gt;What are some of your favorite posts/stories in the community? Do you have a personal experience with giving or receiving kindness? If so
&gt;&gt;As Mods of RK
halopolice is Good Guy Greg. As far as members go he has given more and inspired more people to give than anyone else. Master Chief gave it his all to save humanity from the Flood and the Covenant. It's only befitting therefore that we gifted halopolice the 'Master Chief' flair since he gives us his all at RandomKindness.
Glinda_Da_Good_Witch is nothing short of amazing when you consider the number of times she and her husband have given to members in our community. Though it's not just how often they give but who they give to that speaks to their quality. We have plenty of mothers over at RK who are faced with the coming holiday that is Christmas and find themselves short on cash. In comes Glinda to save Christmas; purchasing items for young children so they too can be merry on the most giving of holidays. Perhaps there’s no better way to describe this couple than their custom flair 'Simply Kind'.
As far as my [ITroom] own personal experience goes



&gt;As a mod
&gt;&gt;What does any small subreddit community want to see happen? We would love to see more members subscribe to RandomKindness and help our community grow. After all, though we have some Canada, UK, and online offers that do offer some geographic diversity.


&gt;What would you like to say to your subscribers? Also
&gt;&gt; As the Mods of RandomKindness we would like to offer up a huge thanks to everyone who has gifted and requested in RK. It’s not often you find people willing to pay out of pocket so a mother can give her children presents, thank you. You members are some of the best reddit has to offer.
I [ITroom] would also personally like to give the Mod team large thanks for helping maintain a generous environment and keeping RandomKindness functioning smoothly.

&gt;Anything awesome you feel that we need to know about r/RandomKindness?
&gt;&gt;RandomKindness isn’t just about buying gifts for people. Some of our most popular requests are from people who just want some snail mail with words of kindness. Some just want a friend to talk to on Skype. Others like advice or inspirational quotes to help them get through the day. You’d be surprised how many members just want someone to talk to and get advice from. I believe this is where the inner strength of our community lies. No matter what you give

Thanks again to Avien and all of the mods over at r/RandomKindness. They really are what makes the reddit community great. Sharing experiences with people who will appreciate them as much as you do. It worth it. Subscribe already :)

**A community for 3 months with 1

I have this bad habit of watching and reading scary things before going to bed. Considering that I'm a huge pansy when it comes to anything remotely frightening, ya I know what you're thinking. *""But MiraP, halloween is over""* It doesn't need to be halloween to see something [that will make your heart skip a beat](http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=350217&amp;no=31&amp;weekday=tue) (I'll be the first to admit it; that comic made me piss my pants a little. Ah, fuck it. We're all friends here right? I soaked my pants in piss and wet the bed that night). Enough about me and my ability to pee, here is [voodoomoocow](http://www.reddit.com/user/voodoomoocow) to tell us about this subreddit.


&gt;What can we find at r/thetruthishere?

&gt;&gt;**voodoomoocow:** r/thetruthishere is a place for people to share their creepy/bizarre encounters that cannot be explained. These are experiences that the person or someone close to them believe to be true. People share local legends that they think actually exist


&gt;How is this subreddit different than r/nosleep?

&gt;&gt;**voodoomoocow:** This isn't a place for creative writing, discussion, and sharing experiences. The most exciting aspect of r/nosleep are all the true stories, but now it's getting harder to find those true stories. We're not trying to compete with r/nosleep; we love that place. Sometimes, though, you feel like having a genuine fright.

&gt;What gave you the idea to start this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**voodoomoocow:** A few of us on r/nosleep were getting irritated at the sudden increase in downvotes on comments

&gt;What do you love most about being a mod?

&gt;&gt;**voodoomoocow:** I was asked to mod because I made the icon and the CSS. That was pretty fun. I love reading about ghosts and scary things

Thanks for the info voodoomoocow. Now that I'm done writing this up and reading posts on r/thetruthishere,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,t3_m4i0l
1308205504.0,i10qs,"June 16th, 2011 r/ListenToThis. A Wonderful Gathering of Music Lovers",Bradorator,85,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/i10qs/june_16th_2011_rlistentothis_a_wonderful/


I am happy to announce that /ListenToThis is today's subreddit of the day.  After a week of conversation between myself and the mods of /ListenToThis I gathered a lot of cool information that I'm sure plenty of people would be happy to read.  Our conversations went from holocaust denial to constipated dogs.  It was very interesting.  Somewhere after we started talking about the time my cat watched ""Two Girls


&gt;&gt;""We're just over two years old now. We have 47

&gt;&gt;Listentothis was started because people were getting pissed off that music submissions to r/music were being constantly and consistently buried. It seemed odd to us that songs got no air time there

&gt;&gt;So, but we wanted it labeled both to feed scrapers and so people who don't like country or metal can avoid those tracks. We also wanted to know who the artist was, and the name of the song.

&gt;&gt;That set some ground rules.

    * If it isn't a music link
    * We remove bands that are household names.
    * We have a strict and required submission format.

&gt;&gt;We're also different from the rest of reddit in that if a band (and lots of their submissions) become consistently popular and constantly upvoted

&gt;&gt;We found out right away that people are more than happy to downvote music they've never heard if its a genre they don't like. We tried a couple of times to get people to stop

&gt;&gt;Killing downvotes also had a strange fringe benefit. The net effect of this for l2t subscribers was that they didn't see very much of our content, and it would take off quickly. Compare an [average vote/approval curve](http://i.imgur.com/zJrUd.png) to [one from listentothis](http://i.imgur.com/GfqUY.png). We even beat r/trees. That's my best guess why. It means our subscribers don't see a lot of our posts in their main feed unless they are really good tracks.

&gt;&gt;We eventually had to put the rules on the sidebar and create a [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/listentothis) so people could see how we operate. Every so often we'll still get a flame thread with someone complaining about post removal (see [this FAQ section](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/listentothis#Wheredoalloftheserulescomefromandwhyaretheyhere) for links to 6 of them.) Lately I get the impression that our subscribers are sick of that discussion. It's the only time listentothis sounds like r/atheism. The word Hipster has become our own variant of [Godwin's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law).

&gt;&gt;I'd say 15% of our subscribers want us to allow everything like the rest of reddit

&gt;&gt;We eventually started making exceptions for new releases by well known artists, though it's up to the moderators if these stay or go. It's lead to some great submissions (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/douby/this_is_fucking_insane/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/gpvaz/led_zeppelin_how_many_more_times_live_the_best/) as examples.)

&gt;&gt;We have horrible issues with the spam filter. Here's an [example](http://i.imgur.com/WIyhg.png). We've taken to adding any frequent submitters to the approved submitters list to make it less of a pain to deal with.

&gt;&gt;There are [a lot](http://www.reddit.com/r/ListenToThis+RadioReddit+freemusic+CoverSongs+ThisIsOurMusic+MyMusic+RedditOriginals+heady+unheardof+HighFidelity+Lyrics+ElectronicMusic+DubStep+DnB+mixes+Trance+Chiptunes+ExperimentalMusic+ElectronicJazz+FutureBeats+ukfunky+FutureGarage+Grime+mashups+idm+house+electrohouse+psytrance+minimal+fidget+hardstyle+darkstep+breakcore+industrialmusic+raggajungle+happyhardcore+gabber+breakbeat+glitchop+glitch+ambientmusic+skweee+FutureFunkAirlines+metal+punk+HardRock+Truemetal+Punkskahardcore+PostHardcore+noiserock+stonerrock+progrockmusic+ProgMetal+Rock+AORMelodic+EmoScreamo+Punk_Rock+poppunkers+HipHopHeads+Rap+altrap+jazz+gamemusic+classicalmusic+RetroMusic+country+rootsmusic+70s+folk+bluegrass+chillmusic+triphop+reggae+ska+whalebait+orchestra+treemusic+WorldMusic+FunkSouMusic+SoundsVintage+postrock+Blues+Tango+FilmMusic+swinghouse+rnb+witch_house+ecouteca+dub+dancehall+purplemusic+chambermusic+AvantGardeMusic+rmx+DownloadThis+PirateRadio+listentomusic+mainstreammusic) of music subreddits now, Metal, and ElectronicMusic are the biggest, and I think it's also because they tend to be love-or-hate genres. This all shows you how spectacularly r/music fails at handling music.

&gt;&gt;If you want a taste of listentothis all you need to do is view our top submissions. There's a link to them in the sidebar

&gt;&gt;The biggest secret is [our new page](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/new/). To some degree, and every single day for the past two years I've seen several artists there that I've never seen before. I think most of our best content only gets between 5 and 20 upvotes.

&gt;&gt;These are some recent finds I would have probably never heard if not for someone submitting them to listentothis.

    * The Baseballs - Hello
    * Michael Kiwanuka - Tell Me A Tale
    * Charles Bradley &amp; The Menahan Street Band - This World

128 friendly hyenas

_____

Close your eyes, most hyena-ist form.

Is it stupid?

Is it smelly?

Is it cruel?

Does it have Whoopi Goldberg's voice?

Did you answer 'yes' to at least 3 of the previous questions? If so

Hyenas are actually pretty cool animals. [Their social structures are complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_hyena#Social_behaviour)

Which brings us to today's featured subreddit! /u/morbidhyena, and much, much, more! (Actually that's about it, but still a very interesting read.) 
Details below!

_____

&gt;How did your fondness of hyenas develop?

&gt;&gt;morbidhyena: I've liked animals since I was a little kid and since then I haven't discriminated between my love for the cuddly and the slightly odd ones. Hyenas absolutely count as cuddly ones though

&gt;Why do you think hyenas get such a bad rap? 

&gt;&gt;mh:I guess it's a tradition for people to misunderstand hyenas as a bad omen, but quite good hunters who kill up to 95% of the animals they eat.

&gt;What is the most interesting hyena fact you know?

&gt;&gt;mh:There are actually four species of hyena, and they also give birth through it! That has to hurt a lot. But to me, the really interesting thing about this species is that their social structures are more similar to those of primates than those of canids or lions. They're really surprisingly intelligent!

&gt;Are there any subreddit rules a new subscriber should know?

&gt;&gt;mh:Subreddit rules? I suppose I don't have any. I try to post something every day, but that isn't really a rule. No hating on hyenas, I guess, but who would do that here anyway? :)

&gt;Anything else you'd like to plug or announce

&gt;&gt;mh:Check out the allied animal subreddit links on the sidebar if you ever feel like you need more capybaras, tapirs or other critters on your frontpage!

&gt;&gt;Anyway

**1

Remember when there was an abundance of music on MTV?  Like most 90s kids, are the classic shows that made it easy to overlook that 90% of MTV's schedule was cartoons and reality shows that occasionally had music hidden in there somewhere.  That somewhere was usually scene transitions.

However, of the MTV shows.  It actually contributed to the M in MTV standing for ""music"" as Beavis and Butthead shamelessly mocked videos, and it featured the slacker culture that was so prominent in the 90s.  It taught everyone everywhere you can't even so much as say ""fire is cool"" at any time ever on TV or else you'll get blamed for fires.  It even spun off another classic MTV staple, /r/Daria.  The original last episode was appropriately titled ""Beavis and Butthead Are Dead,"" but it was resurrected in 2011 with all new episodes teaching us that the dumb duo can adapt to a new generation of teen stupidity.  

The show may or may not be cancelled again.  Not even Google seems to know.  Luckily

/r/BeavisandButthead is an awesome community for *Beavis and Butthead* fans.  Of course you've got your gifs, it has a link to the original ""Peace, Love, and Understanding.""  For those of you who don't know, that was the show's second pilot, and it was later edited.  Heavily.

That's enough of my rambling.  Let's get on to the ramblings of the /r/BeavisandButhead mods.

&gt;##1. What inspired you to create /r/BeavisandButthead?
&gt;&gt; **roger_** I used to love the show

&gt;##2. What episodes would you recommend to anyone who's new to the show?
&gt;&gt; **roger_** 'The Pipe of Doom' has always been a memorable episode to me (premise: Butthead gets stuck in a pipe). There's not a whole lot of continuity to the show though

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** I'm partial to ""No Laughing"" myself.  It was one of the first episodes I remember watching in 1993 when I was 12.  Of course ""Werewolves of Highland"" is just as good of a place for today's generation to start.

&gt;##3. How do you think the 2011 revival compared to the original 90s run?
&gt;&gt; **roger_** It was exactly the same

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** Mike Judge stayed true to what he created in the early '90s IMO.  The revival was appealing to younger people while keeping the long-time fans *more* than satisfied.  Beavis and Butt-Head are timeless.  They made a flawless transition from making fun of 90's pop culutre to the crap seen on MTV today.

&gt;##4. Do you see yourself as more of a Beavis or a Butthead?
&gt;&gt; **atticus138** Well Butt-Head seems to be the ""leader"" of the duo... since roger_ is the creator and top mod

&gt;&gt;**roger_** Butt-head -- I don't have Beavis' energy

Every now and then I see something really amazing and I get a little bit sad. Something so beautiful, but once I reach sad, I'm on the road to ruin. Do I keep going down this path into a depression spiral, or do I hang a sharp right onto Frustration Street?  Ain't no good times on Frustration Street, so if I wind up here, I always pass by Intolerance Avenue, Self Loathing Boulevard and take the onramp to the Highway of Despair.  No stop signs, nobody's gonna slow me down.  So now you know why I religiously avoid all mirrors and photos of myself.  Oh so meta!


Today's featured subreddit falls into this category of [""Too Beautiful To Live""](http://mynorthwest.com/?nid=93).  I'm going to do my best to explain it

Alright, that yelling over there is the religion department.  Then, like it's a John Hughes movie, reddit hires this unbelievably charismatic, handsome, swaggerin' new teacher called ""Mr. RedditDayOf"".  And all the little kids (the ones with the pumped up kicks?), they can't get enough of this teacher.  'Cause he does things much differently.  Once you're in Mr. RedditDayOf's class, some rules.  It's an independent study course and each day Mr. RedditDayOf assigns a topic.  It can be anything from *Unique Transportation* to *High School Required Reading*.  Again, and report back to the class what you learned.  You present your findings in a post and everyone in the class gets to vote you up because you're awesome.  How many people can post on each topic?  As many as you like!  You'll see how it works and then comes the sadness

Here to explain how /r/RedditDayOf works is *tick_tock_clock* and *chap253*.  

**EDIT:**  andyjonesx

&gt;How would you describe [/r/RedditDayOf](/r/redditdayof)?

&gt;&gt;tick_tock_clock:  The formula is: Monday through Saturday, but not as many as the collective sum of our subscribers.

&gt;&gt;chap253:  I think tick_tock_clock is pretty spot on about the description of the subreddit. It's a pretty simple concept so not a lot to elaborate on. (:

&gt;&gt;andyjonesx:  r/RedditDayOf is a way for the community to show off their knowledge. It could give you a reason to research something you might never have before, by the end of the day, somebody in the 'real world' might say ""How do you know so much about door wedges*"".      
*insert any random topic

&gt;How are the daily topics chosen?

&gt;&gt;chap253:  We get ideas submitted to us and add our own ideas and keep them all in a safe place where only we can access them. (; Then one of the mods decides what topics would have the best outcome.

&gt;&gt;ttc:  I don't choose the daily topic

&gt;&gt;ajx:  I have a big document with every suggestion made by the community, but specific enough to be linked.

&gt;&gt;Todays topics were chosen in a panic after I got to work and saw we were Subreddit Of The Day

&gt;How was this subreddit created?

&gt;&gt;ajx:  I was browsing Reddit when I noticed a 'TIL' about a celebrity. Later on I noticed a few more posts about the same person

&gt;What makes a good topic? What's been your favourite day? How about your least favourite topic?

&gt;&gt;ttc:  A good topic is one that prompts lots of posts and discussion. It's got lots of flavor, but North Korea, which prompted a lot of posts, was very successful.

&gt;&gt;chap253:  A good topic is something that a lot of people know obscure things about. Something that people see and want to post about. I think my favorite day was the fairy tales

&gt;&gt;ajx:  A good topic is one that lets people be creative in what they post. Ideally I want a wide range of pictures, and links. I want the community to be able to decide what they think is the best and most interesting out of those.

&gt;&gt;The best day by far was the 'North Korea' day

&gt;Where are people getting their submissions? Are cross-posts allowed (something already seen on reddit)? What about self-posts?

&gt;&gt;ttc:  I don't know where everybody finds their submissions, that would be amazing!

&gt;&gt;People can get them from anywhere. It can be pictures they have taken, but it is up to the community to decide what is the most interesting.

&gt;&gt;Cross-posts are also welcome

&gt;Your turn! Please take a moment to tell us what's on your mind! 

&gt;&gt;chap253:  The other mods

&gt;&gt;ttc:  I would like to thank the other mods for doing such a great job at promoting and maintaining this subreddit

True story time.  One day, it was built to last.  I don't know how or why, but there's Pops coming through the front door with a quarter ton tailoring device and  a big grin on his face.  Mmmaybe it was a grimace.   I don't remember much from my teenage years, but this totally stuck with me somehow.  So, long after dinner around bedtime, dad's still monkeying around with the machine trying to figure it out &amp; get it to work.  He's at the dining room table, he's got 500 watt bulbs shining brightly, tools are everywhere, ""are you ever going to get it working?"" to which he replied, ""how?""  He put his tools down

That sewing machine was never heard from or spoken of again, chasing the unknown and putting it in a submission hold until the answer is revealed or more questions arise.  I also learned that dad couldn't fix a goddamn sewing machine.

I would rather eat a sheet of aluminum foil while sitting in a bucket of ice water than present today's Subreddit of the Day.  These folks are so good at what they do, thought provoking, too beautiful to exist.

Here to present /r/shittyaskscience is two of my least favourite fellas

&gt;What's up bitches?  Who created this subreddit? And please spare me your evolutionary bullshit.

&gt;&gt;About 4 billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of magma... skip a few billion years... Reddit was created... A few years later this subreddit by [PotatoMusicBinge](http://www.reddit.com/user/PotatoMusicBinge). Don't know much about why he created this so can't help you there.

Shitty science is different than your average science that you would find on r/science and r/askscience(even though our two subreddits differ in many ways we have [received their blessing](http://www.reddit.com/r/newreddits/comments/km5oj/rshittyaskscience_the_same_as_askscience_but/c2lgc6r)) because we don't have to worry about the silly stuff like the [scientific method](http://i.imgur.com/RKGNa.png) or rational discourse.

Hello loyal readers

WhatsThisWorth specializes in obscure, pocket watches, and pieces of planets.) But it's not just about bragging about your cool heirlooms: you get a handy appraisal too! So next time you find a Caravaggio in your attic, or a shriveled ear in a box that your grandfather took as a souvenir from the Pacific Theater, think no further than /r/WhatsThisWorth!

Logical_Psycho and gratefulgroover

&gt;What inspired the creation of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Watching too much Pawn Stars and wanting to have a place where anyone could find out what they have and its worth.

&gt;What's the most interesting/valuable item you've ever found?

&gt;&gt;I found a 1813 5 lire silver piece in a $1.00 auction box

&gt;What is your favorite moment/period in history? Why?

&gt;&gt;My passion is finding the consistency of humanity throughout time. Although circumstances and the degree of intensity vary, and one of my favorites to research.

The only time I nearly died in a bar fight happened in a strip club near Algonquin Park in Ontario, Hot girls, All Night, All Right.""  How could anything go wrong?  Without hesitation, I sit down (close to Pervert Row) and order three beers for the table.  A lovely young lady arrives with a trois of beers and quietly informs me that the first round would most definitely exceed the value of the twenty I so confidently held thusly.  I held my pregnant pause, paid the young lady 'bout $25, and with Tarantino like deftness, I mistakedly leaned over and said, and I'm quickly whipped out of the bar, cannot get the image of Fat Chance out of my mind.  THAT was random sexiness.

I'm proud to offer today's Subreddit of the Day, you deserve it!

An now

&gt;How did r/randomsexiness begin?

&gt;&gt;/r/randomsexiness began out of an annoyance of a few other subreddits. Some people were tired of constantly seeing photoshopped or airbrushed girls. I wanted to create a sub where people can post/view real sexiness.

&gt;I never go to the movies without taking drinks &amp; snacks with me. Has anyone tried to sneak a *boob* in r/randomsexiness?

&gt;&gt;For the most part

&gt;Only ladies? What if I was into th' fellas or shetand ponies?

&gt;&gt;Random Sexiness is a subreddit for people who want to see non nude ladies only. I'm not hating on the ones that want to see some guys but there are other subreddits for that.

Part of the high-resolution sensation that is sweeping across Reddit this year, facebook status updates and Omegle screenshots that plague subreddits such as /r/pics and /r/funny. With strict submission guidelines and a whitelist of approved domains, spam has been effectively eliminated. Because each subreddit in the network is focused on a specific genre of images, there is virtually none of the arguing that is found in the larger subreddits over if a particular image belongs there. It is usually very obvious if it is not, and it is removed by the mods.

DestructionPorn is my personal favorite SFWPorn subreddit. While I am not a violent person, I will admit I find a certain beauty of images of destruction. This subreddit embraces that beauty. Check it out for yourself, you won't be disappointed.

Everyone knows our friendly neighborhood Spiderman has a friendly neighborhood meme.  I’m not going to lie

But you may be asking yourself, but you could humor me and pretend like you were.  Anyway…

There is!  /r/spideymeme is the subreddit to get your Spidey meme fix.  Like [this one]( http://i.imgur.com/GuZXt.jpg).  Or [this one](http://i.imgur.com/mw3vu.jpg).  Don’t worry

I contacted the mods of this fine community that provides an excellent service to Reddit

&gt;#1. What inspired this subreddit

&gt;&gt;**larkable** I think the rising popularity of Spider-Man 60's oriented memes in /r/funny made /u/jmf145 create this subreddit. It rose in popularity very quickly. I really like 60's Spidey memes

&gt;&gt;**MSaadJilani** I remember joining this subreddit when it had more or less 6000 subscribers. I'd always loved Spidey Memes and I loved to contribute in making them. I was ecstatic when twatfacer asked me to join the mod team.

&gt;&gt;**twatfacer** http:///www.reddit.com/r/SpideyMeme/comments/qgxod/in_the_beginning_there_was_rspideymeme/

&gt;#2. What is it that you’re looking for from the community?

&gt;&gt;**larkable** I'd say just some funny original content. As long as it hasn't been posted here before, but sometimes one slips through.

&gt;&gt;**twatfacer** I do hope the community preserves the meme’s integrity.  We do not want a fate similar to other /r/AdviceAnimals memes; although SpideyMeme, used on 4chan, we should at least keep the character intact.  Reposting, karma-whoring, and forced memes should always be frowned upon.

&gt;#3. Do you have a favorite Spidey meme

&gt;&gt;**larkable**  Well, but it's all one Spidey story. I posted it in /r/SpideyMeme a while back. If you're interested in seeing it, you can view it [right here](http://gapgames.net/spideybowl/).

&gt;&gt;**MSaadJilani** I contributed in a short series of memes involving Spidey to make a Porn Factory. the subreddit called ""Porn Factory"". I really liked them because The mods absolutely hated it! You can see it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SpideyMeme/comments/103fmf/porn_factory_6/c6a2rk6. )(SFW)

&gt;&gt;**twatfacer** I like the multi-panel ones

&gt;#4. Okay, don’t ask why this scenario is happening.  Now, which meme do you think would give Spidey meme the best fight?

&gt;&gt;**larkable** I think Nicolas Cage (technically

&gt;&gt;**MSaadJilani** Even though Spidey is my all-time favorite meme

&gt;&gt;**twatfacer** I hate mainstream memes

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

**875** Soccer filled circle jerkers!


Why ello everyone, I’m not sure if it’s the colors, the circle jerk on the badge or just the overall atmosphere of this football club, but they are just well my team and I’m honored to feature them today.

&gt;##1. What made you decide to come up with a subreddit dedicated to circlejerking soccer?

&gt;&gt; **stonewallnilgoals**: I think I got downvoted one day in /r/soccer for not circlejerking hard enough, or if I saw that ludicrous display last night, or how many open 2 yard passes Santi Carzola can make in a match, or what Ronaldo's new hair looks like, or that gif of a goal Barcelona scored against a team in last place in La Liga, or why Clint Dempsey would start for any team in the world, or why 2 cunts wouldn't shake hands with each other. I don't have a problem with the moderating there, it's just the content was too much. I spend 99% of my serious soccer redditing time on /r/mls (amazing subreddit) or /r/dcunited

&gt;&gt; **RiseAM**:I am but a peon to the Creator Overlord stonewallnilgoal's ultimate vision. Like any real fan does

&gt;&gt; **ibpants**: I didn't create it

&gt;##2. Why do you like soccer and circle jerking?

&gt;&gt; **stonewallnilgoals**: I like soccer because I've played since I was 5

&gt;&gt; **RiseAM**: Soccer is pretty literally my life. I coach, go to live games, watch on TV... I never get sick of it. But it's good to have a place to kick back, have some fun, and make some good-natured fun of all the bullshit and drama that can arise from the game.

&gt;&gt; **ibpants**: I like football for the warm tingly feeling it gives me deep inside my underpants. As for circlejerking
There's already been some outstanding acts of racism, we know that he's just doing it to be classy and give his lesser team mates their moment in the sun, but I'm looking forward to some really classy moments of class from the classy one.

&gt;##3. What are your hopes for circlejerking soccer this season?

&gt;&gt; **stonewallnilgoals**: Just hoping to see some good parodies of the already circle-jerkiest posts from /r/soccer, who have really enhanced this place.

&gt;&gt; **RiseAM**: To have all these wankers (see what I did there? That's like a British word and it sounds cool because everything from Britland sounds awesome... one day I'll figure out what it means I suppose) who keep posting things to our subreddit continue to amuse me.

&gt;##4. Who is your favorite soccer player?

&gt;&gt; **stonewallnilgoals**: Clint Dempsey, That Welsh Cunt. If you want some real insight though, Chris Pontius of DC United.

&gt;&gt; **RiseAM**: Joey Barton... said no one ever. On the real though

&gt;&gt; **ibpants**: Favourite football player... that's a difficult one. Dempsey has the class, wait... I just checked FIFA 13 and I guess Messi is my favourite player.


&gt;##5. If you could have any player join /r/soccercirclejerk who would it be?


&gt;&gt; **stonewallnilgoals**: I'm not sure

&gt;&gt; **RiseAM**: Joey Barton. For real this time. Not because I like him

&gt;&gt; **ibpants**: Our subscribers are not afraid to say what everyone is being told to think. If they're known for one thing it's their bravery

&gt;##6. Any matches you’re looking forward to?


&gt;&gt; **stonewallnilgoals**: When's the next big handshake derby in the EPL? Bonus points if they are of different colors.&gt;

&gt;&gt; **RiseAM**: MLS Cup... your league isn't a real league unless you have playoffs

&gt;&gt; **ibpants**: Oh I'm really worldly and self-important

##7. Anything you’d like to add or say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **stonewallnilgoals**: Thanks for coming to my favorite subreddit and upvoting all my things. I'd like to think it's because I made the place, thanks for being a part, it's one of my favorite places on reddit.

&gt;&gt; **RiseAM**: No players were hurt in the making of this interview... They all just took a dive and then feigned injury.

&gt;&gt; **ibpants**: Football. Football, football, football. Football.

Hey Readers

The past week of my life has been an pleasure

I decided to go to my town's public library and apply for a library card. YES! Great decision or greatest decision? After becoming a card carrying book-worm, a guide and intro to the world of cartooning, and a few graphic novels I had been meaning to give a skimmin'. Needless to say, I was more than pleased with my haul of printed information. 

As the reality of my inevitable adulthood is setting in, I would hate to see myself fall into a habit of academic apathy. 

So I turn to the sources of free information: the library, even reddit. 

It is places like these that provide us with information, interest or field of study? The three places I would suggest going first would be google.com, a topical subreddit and the public library. 

That being said, for that matter, who wants to dabble with some logic problems and has the patience to learn a computer language. 

Admittedly, code writing and computer languages. Regardless, I would be remise if I neglected to showcase a truly interesting subreddit for all of you out there in internet-land who do enjoy programming and programming related..eh...stuff? Maybe it's time I take a stroll down to my local public library and pick up a C++ for Dummies Book, eh? 
 
[/r/dailyprogrammer](/r/dailyprogrammer) is a programming project that challenges users to solve logical and practical problems using nothing but their minds and a few lines of code from any language of their choosing. C++, you can write code to solve these problems with it. From my brief time scrolling through comments, the community seems to be respectful; they have their page CSS set up to where solutions to problems can be hidden and all discussion seemed purposive and constructive. The mods of this subreddit, on a fairly regular basis, post new problems of varying difficulty, allowing for a more diverse group of users to interact on multiple levels.


The project's main focus is fostering creativity

Thanks for reading and have a good holiday weekend.

Good vibes

Hello loyal readers! Many of us take for granted the structures that stand at the horizon. It can be easy to forget the hours of work by hundreds of people went into every building, to give off a persona all its own. This is the art of architecture!

(Now

What makes architecture an interesting artform (IMO), like you can with a cathedral. ) The smooth and uniform pillars belong to antiquity, as the regal towers and domes reflect on the Renaissance. The modern era of architecture brought us minimalist and meditative forms. 

Do you need to know the field of well to enjoy it, and the mods of today's SROTD have done the same with their subreddit. 

Fergi

&gt;What inspired you to mod /r/architecture? 

&gt;&gt;I had been active in the community a couple years ago when I was asked by the moderating team to help fight the spam submissions and make sure the right content got to our front page. I liked the community and architecture is a passion of mine

&gt;What experience do you have in the field yourself? What art/architect/style has been most influential on you? 

&gt;&gt;I am in my fourth year pursuing my Bachelor of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin

&gt;&gt;And personally I love [brutalism](http://fuckyeahbrutalism.tumblr.com/)

&gt;What sorts of posts can be found in /r/architecture? 

&gt;&gt;We have a nice mixture of students, so you'll see anything from sexy blog posts about minimalist houses to in-depth discussions about the direction of the profession. We also have a talkative community that regularly discusses software and offers design critiques. And we have been known to see the occasional architecture student rage comic.

&gt;What is your personal favorite building? Why? 

&gt;&gt;That's a tough question! Right now I have just returned from studying abroad,cf.osb&amp;fp=57b234fa78ff461a&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=569) by Le Corbusier. I spent three days nights living with monks in the middle of nowhere. It was sublime and gave me a reason to fall in love with Le Corbusier again.

&gt;How has the field of architecture changed in recent years? 

&gt;&gt;I'm hoping another mod will answer this one

&gt;&gt;I think I could also speak about the rise of ""green"" techniques

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/architecture? 

&gt;&gt;I know how many lurkers we have! Speak up and say hi! We don't bite!

A kitchen of ***5, ***for 1 WHOLE YEAR!***


Being a broke, I have become extremely proficient in the culinary arts' discipline of sandwiching. Some, I would humbly suggest, consider me an aficionado of the breaded wonder. So, when [r/eatsandwiches](http://www.reddit.com/r/eatsandwiches/) was shown to me, I had to take a moment to highlight for you one of the quickest ways get your mouth watering. 

R/eatsandwiches is a community of foodies that love making sandwiches and taking pictures of them for people to see. It is an predominately image based community

When you look a little closer at the philosophy of r/eatsandwiches, being eaten by all kinds of people allows for an interesting ""photo-commentary""; a glimps into the lives of everyday people chowing down on grub they love!

&gt;&gt;I had a free night and wanted to make a subreddit

&gt;2.) What can people expect to find at r/eatsandwiches?
&gt;&gt;Sandwiches. [Pictures](http://i42.tinypic.com/14ih1xd.jpg) of sandwiches. [Recipes](http://www.reddit.com/r/eatsandwiches/comments/lylqx/the_hoagie/) for sandwiches. Recipes for sandwich ingredients. Discussion about sandwiches! (Since there is no consensus on what a sandwich actually is)

&gt;3.) Do you have a favorite sandwich? If so why? (include picture of sandwich if you can.)
&gt;&gt;Mmm, really. I'm from California, where [Dutch Crunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_bread) is really popular, and I love a good caprese on that.

3 minutes of added time. You have the ball. You make a 30-yard pass to your striker. He’s out of harms way. It’s just you and the keeper now. 1 on 1. Just this one goal and you win. The crowd is cheering you on. You wait for the perfect moment. It’s here. You shoot AND…[insert the rest of your story here].

Like many of you, r/soccergaming gives gamers a chance to share tactics, give tips, and much much more.

As a new mod

&gt;Please tell us what we’ll find at r/soccergaming.
&gt;&gt;**ScreamingGerman:** Anything related to the major soccer (football) video games, and Sports Interactive's Football manager. We discuss tactics in the game, organize online tournaments and share tips and strategies.

&gt;&gt;**ImmanuelXavier:** You will also find a collective of very worthy gentlemen who partake in many gentlemanly activities such as being gentle. But we're also alpha as fuck

&gt;When and why did you decide to start r/soccergaming?
&gt;&gt;**ImmanuelXavier:** Here's an anecdote: when the subreddit was created


&gt;&gt;**ScreamingGerman:** Prior to the subreddit, and we were outgrowing r/soccer. It was founded by TerryWogan and the rest of us volunteered to help out.

&gt;What’s your favorite part about being a mod?
&gt;&gt;**ImmanuelXavier:** The warm fuzzy feeling I get each time I rescue a post trapped in the spam cue. Also

&gt;&gt;**ScreamingGerman:** The banhammer

&gt;Now that FIFA 12, are you worried that traffic might die down?
&gt;&gt;**ImmanuelXavier:** No, if I'm not mistaken. I wouldn't be surprised if activity continued to increase, especially if we get a few more tournaments running.

&gt;&gt;**ScreamingGerman:** Exactly as ImmanuelXavier said - people will always be playing these games online and will be waiting for the new versions to come out. The subreddit will just shift from discussing last year's games to this year's games.

&gt;Time to get a little personal
&gt;&gt;**ImmanuelXavier:** The Arsenal. Holland. The former because they are my club; the latter because of heritage.

&gt;&gt;**ScreamingGerman:** Chelsea and Germany. Germany for my heritage

&gt;Is there any last bit of information you want to add?
&gt;&gt;**ImmanuelXavier:** Yes. My answer to the previous third question: The warm fuzzy feeling I get each time I rescue a post trapped in the spam cue. Also

&gt;&gt;**ScreamingGerman:** I want to emphasize the warm fuzzy feeling I get each time I can use the banhammer. Also


Many thanks to ImmanuelXavier and ScreamingGerman although I was hoping one of you would be a Liverpool supporter so we can become reddit best friends. I guess in this case

Welcome to Michelle Bachman's greatest nightmare and deepest

MeetLGBT is a community full of incredibly nice and outgoing personalities. It's a place where members of the lesbian, meet new friends, and basically just be themselves. That's important because, as hard as it is to believe, there *is* still discrimination against such people in the world. Some states here in America have legalized same-sex marriage, sure. They can now serve openly in the military, great. Hell, believe it or not

Don't believe me? Well

Still not convinced that there are bigots in this country? Well, but you can't make this stuff up.

The point is that while America is being dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century

What a stupid world.

Thankfully there's reddit and places like /r/MeetLGBT where such nonsense is merely laughed at. Live in rural Mississippi and afraid to come out to your fellow students

A while ago I decided to practice my American Sign Language with /r/MeetLGBT's creator

\*Ed's Note: I've just been told that LGBT people *can*

***

&gt;LGBTerrific

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** Thanks for voting MeetLGBT as a subreddit of the day! I created MeetLGBT as a way for members of [/r/lgbt](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt) to get to know each other better, “a queer hangout”.

&gt;&gt;To find out more about the group in general

&gt;Anonymity on the Internet is usually considered a pretty big deal. Your /r/ seems dedicated to breaking down that barrier. Please discuss and explain the exact reason for your /r/'s existence.

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** MeetLGBT is about helping to create a community here on reddit. There are lots of very bright and talented redditors from all over the world. People are constantly expressing their opinions and little things about themselves on this site (check out [/r/redditbiography](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditbiography) for an example of how much information can be revealed with just comments). But what if you want to know someone for more than their once in a while comment? That's the point of MeetLGBT. Get to know someone's hobbies, etc. I had fallen in love with [/r/redditoroftheday](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditoroftheday) last year, and felt that something similar could be applied to /r/lgbt, to bring the lgbt community closer together.

&gt;As a straight Caucasian male

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** Get some color into your life. Embrace diversity. I think it’s easy to see lgbt people as an “invisible minority” because sexual orientation isn’t necessarily something that can be seen. You know someone who is lgbt already. Perhaps that individual hasn't come out to you, non-gender conforming part of society. Getting to know some of the issues that lgbt people face, and how our lives are different or similar can be a great way to learn more about the world.

&gt;While researching your /r/ I noticed that you all seem obsessed with sharing movie and book suggestions with each other. Why is that?

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** We're not obsessed. We can quit any time we want. It just happens there are a lot of movies and books out there featuring lgbt characters and topics... but they’re not easy to find. The media isn’t always filled with lots of lgbt characters

&gt;Currently, if even briefly?

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** Ah, in general. That’s the main premise of the group - show yourself off, for others to get to know you. What’re your talents, interests, hobbies? Where do you live? Where would you like to live? Etc.

&gt;I noticed that you used to be the ""Wednesday person"" for /r/subredditoftheday. Hell

&gt;&gt;**LGBTerrific:** You had to go there

&gt;&gt;Well

&gt;Lesbians, and Transgendered people suffer a lot of discrimination in my country ('murikah). If you could say just one short sentence to all of the bigots out there, what would it be?

Today

/r/Krivoshein itself is a [beautiful](http://i.imgur.com/1FobL.jpg) *(read: delightfully weird as fuck*) subreddit, while others are branded with pictures of Krivoshein's real life friends.

The subreddit's content consists mainly of [brilliant](http://i.imgur.com/LWhut.jpg) and [horrible](http://i.imgur.com/rQsI6.gif) photoshops of Krivoshein/Sasha [and co](http://i.imgur.com/NH5mE.jpg). doing just about [everything](http://i.imgur.com/i6YN1.png) and [anything](http://i.imgur.com/toqmG.png) you can imagine. Fuck_You_Krivoshein also likes to make the occasional [hate speech](http://www.reddit.com/r/Krivoshein/comments/15g93m/krivomas_day/) to rally his subscribers against Krivoshein. 

An excerpt of his latest speech for the lazy:

&gt;First of all I wan[t] to thank Krivoshein himself for being such an amazing sport about this. He is definitely still freaked out, he just takes it in stride, even participating in jokes. He's still a dick and I hate him.


But what really makes this sub interesting/kinda creepy is its Fuck_You_Krivoshein's tireless dedication to /r/Krivoshein and the mystery surrounding his true identity.

 FYK posts in /r/Krivoshein daily, and apparently [made a fake Facebook account also named ""Fuck You Krivoshein""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Krivoshein/comments/14404z/they_shut_down_my_face_book/) which he used to stalk Krivoshein and friends, though it was eventually deleted by FB. 

Before you get too creeped out or alarmed

""But... why does this sub exist
----------------------------

Why, and for those answers, I'll direct you to the first of **two interviews** that we have today- the first being with **/u/Fuck_You_Krivoshein** himself, and the second with poor **/u/Krivoshein** who doesn't quite know either.

Let's welcome FYK

**Interview 1: /u/Fuck_You_Krivoshein**

&gt;1.What inspired you to create /r/Krivoshein?

&gt;&gt;Initially I just decided to fuck with /u/Krivoshein as a joke

&gt;&gt;Then I was on one of my favourite subs; /r/cringe, and [he posted it](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepyPMs/comments/11uh7p/hi_to_you_too/) to /r/creepypms. It spiralled into crazy town from there, and although the comment has been removed I created /r/Krivoshein and posted a link to it.

&gt;2.Who is Krivoshein

&gt;&gt;He's actually a friend of mine at school. I was sort of playing a joke on him and figured he'd forget or figure it out in a week

&gt;3.It seems like your sub has a very tight knit community dedicated to Krivoshein. Do you guys know him in real life or is your backstory more... questionable than that?

&gt;&gt;Surprisingly it has brought us all together as a group. We are all friends at school, or newreddits but it's really an inside joke. I thought it would be a nice way to mess with /u/Krivoshein if I tried /r/subredditoftheday, I didn't expect any response at all.

&gt;&gt;We tend to go through fads by the way, then it was AMAs, then it was Morphing his face with others' (/r/KrivosheinMorphs), now it's erotic fan-fiction.

&gt;4.Can you give us a hint about your true identity?

&gt;&gt;I'm honestly worried I've said way too much in this interview and that you could figure it out from this alone. I won't say anything more but I bet if some smart reddit folks came to our sub they could analyse the main players and figure out who it is

&gt;&gt;[Here is a link to my origin story](http://www.reddit.com/r/Krivoshein/comments/11v7sq/welcome/c6qc0bv). It is true

&gt;5.Anything you'd like to say to /u/Krivoshein or your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Hey, resulting in a traumatic event thats drives you to drink folr years. That is until you meet a nice journalist/gardener from Manitoba, you hit it off and spend a month together in the Bahamas and she makes you know what happiness is again. After 2 years, on your anniversary, you are ready to propose, but just as she is approaching the restaurant she is crushed under a an angry jealous camel RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES. The doctors soon learn that she was with child, you don't show up to the funeral

&gt;&gt;To the subscribers

**Interview 2: /u/Krivoshein**

&gt;1.How did you learn about /r/Krivoshein?

&gt;&gt;Well... Out of the blue I got sent a pm from Satan/Lucifer/Mittler that is /u/Fuck_You_Krivoshein. That was terrifyingly creepy. Now

&gt;2.Do you have any idea why this sub exists?

&gt;&gt;Have no idea why this sub exists. Whatsoever. I mean


&gt;3.Who do you think /u/Fuck_You_Krivoshein is?

&gt;&gt;He's Satin. Without an a. It's a terrifying texture

&gt;4.What do you think about /r/Krivoshein?

&gt;&gt;... It's a terrifying place. Like

&gt;5.Anything you'd like to say to the sub's subscribers or /u/Fuck_You_Krivoshein?

&gt;&gt;I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you. With kindness. ...Might take a while.

Ok

Also

Why is it so hard for me to learn another language. I one of the most complex information processing systems in the universe and it forgets where my keys are most days. 

I really like how people think reality television shows are NOT soft scripted. When will people learn that most everything you see on television is produced. Written and NOT REAL. For entertainment purposes only. 

That is the United States most prized export: entertainment. Sports, award shows all of it. It's the most useless product to sell and we charge the most for it. #1 Baby. 

While other countries are trying to improve infrastructure, fighting made up enemies and providing the world with movies like ""The Tooth-Fairy"" .

Since I moved into my apartment

I moved into a cheap apartment this past weekend. After almost a full week in house

About to watch the movie 21 Jump Street here in a just a touch. Probably will fall asleep to it. I have been falling asleep with music/movies on since I was a little kid. Hard habit to break and even tougher to sleep without it. It's funny how subject we are to patterns and repeated actions. Repetition might be one of the biggest things holding us back as humans. Forcing ourselves to live in the complacency of familiarity. It's easier

I picked /r/pieces today as the SROTD. Why? because to be honest I am pretty tired of dealing with marijuana being illegal. I think it's just about clear to everyone that, though /r/glassheads is more suited for that arena. Some of the more ""home-spun"" pieces can be questionable at time, but the community is supportive and tries to give the best advice possible.

So I'm having one of those afternoons when my kids are just shy of putting each other in the morgue.  Seriously that sentence cracked me up for like 5 minutes 'cause I pictured my 6 year old son in a murder suicide in our foyer and I'm all, totally irrelevant.

But yeah, volcanoes... The dead rising from the grave!  Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria! 

Fortunately

*""They became increasingly common, and eCards were voted out.""*

So now... now I have one more destination

I enjoy eCards because nearly every time I walk away in hysterics... such consistency, it speaks to me.  And if it's wrong, I don't wanna be correct!

Today we feature [/r/eCards](/r/eCards) as a Saturday morning gift to you, you gotta see this"" or ""I'm gonna send you this"" moments.  Maybe it'll bring you and your spouse closer together.  Perhaps [/r/eCards](/r/eCards) will make you see her the same way you see Kelly the lifeguard at your kid's swimming lessons.  And maybe [/r/eCards](/r/eCards) will encourage your wife to invite Kelly over to ""babysit"" and ""do a couple whippits"" and ""rub Gold Bond on my nuts with a warm oven mit"".

As I get older, there are varying degrees when it comes to how strongly I feel about certain things, and of course some things can move back and forth between categories!  Things like microwaved mozzarella cheese sticks, Steely Dan and knowing where the nail clippers are... these all rank way, way up in the ""glad to have it"" category.  And in the same breath, my acne, unscripted television and the unexplained puddles of water in our basement, cantelope.  I really want to love cantelope

Now, The Library of Shadows.*  You thought I'd pick a subreddit I was glad to have in my life?  So wrong my friend.  For me, The Library of Shadows is my cantelope, my casaba and my honeydew!  Oh how I long to love you [/r/libraryofshadows](/r/libraryofshadows)... we would be so perfect together!  But alas, I must put you in the ""get that outta my life"" category.  Please insert your own profanity.

The Library of Shadows (or LOS), I'll just read one horror, suspense or thriller post.""  And then this gangrenous, boney hand from the soil reaches up and you get pulled in to read another and another until you can no longer think clearly.  Seriously, there are some incredible submissions that will scare the stuffing out of you!  And you don't have to go far, just pick any off the front page or dig deep - this collection is both thick and sick.

Although it pains me, a most wretched place where men without facial features chase you into abandoned warehouses, ooh and the men run on all fours in a most unnatural herky-jerky way!  I do hereby submit to you The Library of Shadows, because I hate suffering alone!

Sadly the moderators of LOS were approached at the last minute and most likely were doing their charitable work.  I believe on Monday nights they're volunteer gift wrappers at the mall?  Anyway

[Hey

&gt;Please explain The Library of Shadows!  How did this begin?

&gt;&gt;Library of Shadows is a magazine/forum dedicated to showcasing original content vis-a-vis fiction submitted by visitors to the subreddit, or that were obviously fiction, because there had been many complaints about submissions that ""broke the fourth wall"" to some degree, and submissions that were so long they had to be broken up into multiple posts. I hated seeing contributors receive backlash for such hard work, and felt they needed a place where length and a variety of POVs could stretch their legs.

&gt;&gt;It evolved rather quickly into a place where prolific content producers could seek consumer exposure and feedback on an academic level without the pretense of veracity--as you might know if you browse /r/nosleep, personal websites, etc., because to perpetuate authenticity they can't really promote themselves. The Library also allows them to submit pieces that don't quite fit in at /r/nosleep, such as third-person-perspective, alternative histories like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and epic stories about events that wouldn't have escaped the global media's attention such as alien invasions and zombie apocalypses. It's difficult to maintain the suspension of disbelief when the story is about something that wouldn't have gone unnoticed by CNN.

&gt;Tell us about those who submit posts to /r/libraryofshadows. Amateurs

&gt;&gt;Writers from all levels post to the Library... amateur authors submit all the time

&gt;&gt;On that note, /r/darkworkshop, a lot of their activity orbits around the assumption that the community is comprised mainly of writers, so you see a lot of posts about wordcount, industry tidbits, musings about personal projects, help sought for writer's block, which was devised in the spirit of those old monthlies that Stephen King cut his teeth on, just like the greats!

&gt;Anything else I'm missing? Anything you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;To end, to my friends in the publishing and writing industries... I'm trying to ensure that my contributors get seen by people that can enrich their career, like literary agents and mainstream horror authors.

Sometimes I get so engrossed in a fantasy book or movie that people have to tell me to snap out of it. In reply I usually quote Lisa Simpson: *""Why? I'm so much happier here!""*

People who don't catch the Simpsons reference often ask me why all things fantasy make me so happy in the first place. To them I simply state

Of course, say, an episode of *Hoarders* or *Intervention*, your odds aren't as good. Logically speaking, then, fantasy is clearly greater than depressing reality TV.

These are all things the good mods over at /r/Fantasy understand well. /r/Fantasy is the ""catch all"" subreddit for people who think dragons are cool. It's also a handy portal to other more specific fantasy-related subreddits (for example

My hope was that I would get a chance to interview one of its other moderators but [elquesogrande](http://www.reddit.com/user/elquesogrande) declared

***

&gt;I have a recurring fantasy that involves me and two hot women. I can't go into anymore detail about what the three of us get up to without turning this into a NSFW post

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: In the broadest sense

&gt;&gt;/r/Fantasy is a place where redditors who are interested in the broad Fantasy genre can interact with others that have the same interest. This is a hub where Fantasy fans can interact before diving into sub-genres across reddit.

&gt;A few years back I introduced an author of mystery/suspense novels to his first fantasy book: A Game of Thrones (seriously: he'd never even read Tolkien before). He loved the book but raised an interesting question after finishing it: ""If this is 'fantasy'

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Some of the earliest known literature is clearly Fantasy as we define it today. Ancient mythology and works like The Odyssey or The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. The roots of our modern storytelling are founded on Fantasy

&gt;&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are in the ‘High Fantasy’ category where the world’s rules

&gt;&gt;George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Fire and Ice series tends towards ‘Low Fantasy’ – following more of a medieval theme with a smattering of fantasy-like events. Works like these break the stereotypical fantasy mold and have blurred the overall definition of Fantasy.

&gt;&gt;Fantasy can take the form of stories, games, songs and graphic novels. In addition to the classic definitions, the broad genre of fantasy can include superheroes, steampunk, horror, space fantasy, urban fantasy and many other sub-genres.

&gt;Your /r/ has conducted AMA's with several prominent fantasy authors already. Also

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Novelists constantly engage with fans and potential fans to promote their works via book signings, insightful fantasy fans via r/Fantasy.

&gt;&gt;The successful fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson is an active redditor who participates in r/Fantasy and a number of other writing / fantasy-related subreddits. We worked with Brandon to set up a very successful AMA. Learning from what worked and what needed to be refined

&gt;&gt;AMA TIPS (*for moderators of other subreddits* -ed.): Be clear and professional in what you are offering, directly contact the author.

&gt;Name one (and only one) product of the fantasy genre that everyone should experience at least once in their life. This can be a book, or what-have-you.

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: Tackle a Fantasy book series at least once in your life. If you enjoyed any of the recent Fantasy movies and TV series - realize that novels offer greater depth and more personal immersion into those worlds.

&gt;&gt;Tolkien’s *The Lord of the Rings*, Joanne Rowling’s *Harry Potter*, Robin Hobb’s *The Farseer Trilogy*, Stephen King’s *The Dark Tower*, Jim Butcher’s *The Dresden Files*, Patrick Rothfuss’ *A Kingkiller Chronicle* are all great choices. There are many series to choose from and arguments to be made about which would be ‘the best choice.’ If you have never read a series before, dig through reviews about each and dive into one series that catches your eye.

&gt;From subreddit to subreddit

&gt;&gt;**elquesogrande**: /r/Fantasy was created as a general hub for all things Fantasy on Reddit. Love the games Oblivion or Skyrim? Fantasy artwork? Fantasy novels and the worlds created within them? Dive into the niche subreddits that focus on your exact interest and also join r/Fantasy to learn more about similar interests.

&gt;&gt;Active r/Fantasy users tend to be insightful

When most people think of game music
produced for earlier systems such as the SNES
we called the ""Genesis"")

It probably consists mostly of bleeps

That's fine

The only problem is
and game culture
and uninteresting

Game music has evolved far beyond the 16-bit spectrum. Soundtracks that complement
games are now comparable to those that we might ordinarily associate with 
high-production movies or TV shows. They're expensive

/r/gamemusic is a subreddit about all of the above. It's a celebration of the
wonderful game soundtrack
on orchestral soundtrack produced for today's multi-million dollar blockbuster
games. 

Whether you're a game fan looking to rekindle those moments in your favourite
games by listening to the music that underpinned them (almost any track in
Half-Life 2 in which a helicopter chase sequence occurs always tickles my fun
parts) or if you're just looking to find some new music in an unexpected place
look no further than [/r/gamemusic](http://reddit.com/r/gamemusic)

Sometimes when an amazing picture shows up on /r/pics I think to myself, I wish there was an entire subreddit for pics like that!""  After having that profound insight I typically close the picture, click the next one on my front page, and think, ""Awww! Kittens!""

Other redditors are more proactive and actually create subreddits dedicated to specific genres of pictures. And while /r/pics remains a good catch-all

/r/SpecArt is a subreddit dedicated to images of imagined worlds. Everything from futuristic Sci-Fi cities to sprawling Fantasy landscapes can be found here alongside post-apocalyptic war-zones, however, do, which is good news for those of us who enjoy the finer things in life.

~~Unfortunately I was unable to meet with the moderators this week for the normal interview.~~ Eventually reddit came out of read-only mode so I was able to correspond with moderators gabwyn and 1point618 for the following interview.

***

&gt;What gave you the idea to create/moderate for this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**gabwyn**: It was 1point618's idea to create this subreddit after seeing a number of really cool pieces of art submitted to the /r/scifi subreddit

&gt;&gt;The 3 of us (1point618

&gt;&gt;As a reader of sf/f it's great to see an artists impression of a universe you are familiar with and see how it measures up to what you have in your minds eye.

&gt;&gt;There have been a few comments here and there from writers who have found the contents of the subreddit have cured them of their writers block; it's good to see that SpecArt isn't just an inspiration to us dreamers

&gt;&gt;**1point618**: The one piece of the story that is missing here is that I'm a huge PnP RPG fan (think Dungeons and Dragons), and one day the bug just bit me and I decided it was a thing we all had to make happen. Luckily gabwyn and PL have been with me from the beginning on r/printSF and r/SFBC, and I knew that we could together make something big. I think that within 24 hours we had over 500 subscribers, and now at under a year we're up to 4.5k.

&gt;Give the good folks out there a taste. Please give me a link to one of your favorite images that might show up at /r/SpecArt.

&gt;&gt;**gabwyn**:     We tried to capture as many different types of artwork that would fall under the 'speculative' umbrella in our header; sci-fi, psychadelic, superheroes (btw that's Wolverine fighting the T-Rex) etc.

&gt;&gt;Here are some of the top submissions that I particularly like:

&gt;&gt;* [A piece by Imperial Boy](http://i.imgur.com/740I4.jpg)

&gt;&gt;* [""Earth Colossus"" by Chase Stone](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/170/6/1/earth_colossus_by_chase_sc2-d3jdoxw.jpg)

&gt;&gt;* ['The Remains which Live' by kakotomirai](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs51/f/2009/275/d/1/The_remains_which_live_by_kakotomirai.jpg)

&gt;&gt;* [""Lost Spaceship"" by Quentin Mabille](http://i.imgur.com/u2h5q.jpg)

&gt;&gt;* [""Dream"" by Tobias Roetsch](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/346/0/0/dream_by_taenaron-d34q599.jpg)

&gt;&gt;**1point618**: Gabwyn picked 4/5 of my favorites. The only thing I'd change is #3 for either something by Alex Grey or Zak Smith. I do wish we'd see more psychedelic / abstract / bizzarre art sometimes.

&gt;Does your community seem to have a favorite artist? In other words

&gt;&gt;**gabwyn**: I would probably say Nicolas Bouvier (aka Sparth) fits the bill

&gt;&gt;Some other popular and established artists in the SF/F genres to check out are John Harris

&gt;&gt;**1point618**: Ditto Gabwyn

&gt;Are any of you aspiring artists? If so

&gt;&gt;**gabwyn**: We're not artists

&gt;&gt;**1point618**: Nope

&gt;Finally: I'm a huge *A Song of Ice and Fire* fan. Does any art from Martin's series ever show up at /r/SpecArt? If not

&gt;&gt;**gabwyn**: I put in as many keywords into the reddit search as possible and I was shocked to find I couldn't find any art related to ASOIAF

&gt;&gt;If you type in 'Game of Thrones' in deviantart you'll notice that most of the characters look like famous actors. It would be interesting to see some artwork posted that was created before the HBO series was released.

&gt;&gt;**1point618**: I almost submitted some SOIAF artwork the other day when I found Ted Nasmith's phenomenal gallery: http://www.tednasmith.com/other/grrmartin.html . Unfortunately I was on an iPhone, check out all his castle landscapes and the pic of Tyrion in King's Landing, it really gives you a feel for the books.

I can tell, that you redditors are both cunning and shrewd. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;. 

I don’t expect you to just subscribe to ***ANY*** Subreddit all willy-nilly like. So

***WELL

The r/pumpkins community is doing some terrifyingly exciting things this Halloween season. From pumpkin recipes to the *2nd ANNUAL PUMPKIN CARVING CONTEST*! 

So, ***tastydirtslover***. (insert figurative applause here).

***THE INTERVIEW***


&gt;1.) Why did you create r/pumpkins? Was it because you wanted to express your hot burning love for the large orange gourd?
&gt;&gt;None of us created /rpumpkins who are modding it now. The original creator, and posted a thread in askreddit - who would like to have a *pumpkin carving contest?* There was a huge positive response! So, I searched through the existing subreddits and found[ r/pumpkin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pumpkins)! Krisdafish wasn't doing much with it and was happy for me to become a mod.

&gt;2.) Tell me more about the r/Pumpkin Carving Contest I have heard about?
&gt;&gt;The pumpkin carving contest is simple. We only have a few rules and we also have prizes. Hope I mentioned that clearly.**We have prizes.** Some redditor named *Sure_Ill_Draw_That* has promised one of his t-shirts to a redditor. Also

---
***How The Contest Works***

We have a pumpkin competition every year for Halloween.

The closing date is the 1st of November 2011

YOU MUST SUBMIT PROOF THAT THE PUMPKIN IS YOURS. Proof must be your username and the date somewhere in the picture - maybe a piece of paper


**AGAIN THERE ARE SWEET PRIZES**

* $100

* A custom shirt from Sure_Ill_Draw_That


Last year the winners were based on the number of upvotes and the fact they had a picture submitting proof.


This year we are following the same format



---


&gt;3.) After Halloween is over
&gt;&gt;We have the occasional visitor but not many. We tend just to carry on browsing the rest of reddit and planning for next year. I grow my own vegetables so I'll be down the veg patch trying to grow some decent pumpkins next year.


&gt;4.) What are you mods personally doing for halloween this year (events/costume descriptions)?
&gt;&gt; Personally I'll be carving pumpkins and smashing them up with a hammer!


&gt;5.) We all like knowing what Redditors are like IRL. So
&gt;&gt;I have a real job. It's pretty good - work as a field Biologist in Pest control.


&gt;6.) Anything to say to the subscribers of r/pumpkins?
&gt;&gt;Dear subscribers of /r/pumpkins
Remember in order to be in with a chance of winning you must submit proof of ownership.
Every single pumpkin submission makes me smile and you guys turning my feed orange makes October a great month to mod a subreddit like this.
Happy pumpkinning!

&gt;7.) Anything else we need to know about your ***KILLER*** subreddit? 
&gt;&gt;If you see a pumpkin picture on reddit please try to direct them towards us!

Thanks again to tastydirtslover for her superb modding and for being a down-right excellent person!
I hope that you

A week after posting reddit's college football subreddit I thought it would only be fitting to post /NFL next.  With the NFL season coming back to life after their lockout people are flocking to their fantasy football leagues and the game in general.  After a brief conversation with rasherdk I was able to find out what their subreddit is all about.

&gt;&gt;The subreddit really took off around the start of last year's season, the logos also help giving us a sense of community and belonging that goes with all sports fandom.  With them come the risk of other users latching onto them unfairly, but the community has so far been able to keep that in check.

&gt;&gt;Somewhat surprisingly

&gt;&gt;From being a small subreddit of less than a thousand readers [last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/d3wdl/congrats_rnfl_for_reaching_1000_users/)

&gt;&gt;So what goes on in /NFL?  It is basically a combined sports magazine and sports bar.  Links to news stories about the NFL make up a large part of our content, etc.  We have game threads for commenting on games as they're being played.  Each week we also host a trash talk thread (famously in ALL CAPS) where we invite our users to a no holds barred duel on words - for some reason it usually ends up being very self-deprecating, which is often even more fun.

&gt;&gt;Outside of Reddit we gather on IRC in #reddit-nfl on irc.freenode.net where we have a bot that announces news and more importantly

&gt;&gt;We have a group of dedicated users who produce weekly power rankings of the teams during the season

&gt;&gt;It is also important to note that each individual team has their own subreddit (which is linked in our sidebar), what are you waiting for?",,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,

CANNONBALL!

So there's been a lot of news lately. Who am I kidding

So imagine a world where you can post an interesting story and not get a bunch of people comment yelling ""THIS DOESN'T BELONG HERE"".

I'm looking at *you*

I'm just kidding, maybe even Newt), all the dang Native Americans should go back to their own country, and Murica is the greatest country in the world. Back to back world war champs! Fuck yeah, America.

Anyways

Enough about how we all love America

&gt;##1. Who started /r/anythinggoesnews and what's the story behind it?

&gt;&gt; Mind_Virus started it as a place with little to no rules and invisible moderation.

&gt;##2. Does anything *really* go?

&gt;&gt; For me

&gt;##3. What do you do as a moderator if anything goes?

&gt;&gt; Very little. I look at the mod mail and see if people need a link approved

&gt;##4. What's your favorite thing about this place?

&gt;&gt; It doesn't want to fracture Reddit or live up to some utopian vision of the past. It allows the users to decide and gives people what they want


&gt;##5. Any last things you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt; Mind_Virus has actually pulled off a pretty good network here. He made it in response to the addition of so many rules in the defaults and the success of this network somewhat proves the users don't really want highly moderated and strict subs. This questionnaire had been the most I have ever done as a mod and will probably be the most I ever do. I am a user account like so many others and my mod status here only give me the privilege to hit approve for things the spam filter gets wrong.

Today, you know?  Secondly, it's a great community that'll answer your questions about interior design.  Furniture, colour, favourite positions, where it feels good, the bad place, and most importantly, generous and never neglect anything!  Some things cost extra

I urge you to check out [/r/InteriorDesign](/r/InteriorDesign) and spend some time scouring the posts

&gt;Please tell us how /r/InteriorDesign started.

&gt;&gt;It all mysteriously began with designfan two years ago. * unnecessary hand waving*

&gt;What will we find upon visiting /r/InteriorDesign?

&gt;&gt;When you first enter r/Interiordesign you will see a simple definition of what interior design is

&gt;Would you say this subreddit is directed to those interested in highbrow art or layman stuff? Who are you targeting - those with money

&gt;&gt;The Interior design subreddit is really for anybody is interested in the subject

&gt;Is there a certain type of posting that gets the greatest reaction? What are your favourite types of posts?

&gt;&gt;Of course Reddit being what it is

&gt;Why should we all subscribe to /r/InteriorDesign?
  
&gt;&gt;This is the best question yet. The reason you should subscribe to this subreddit is because as a whole, and general interior design concepts. Also the way reddit is set up there is always new stuff to look at, and never ending. I appreciate everyone who took the time to read this, and I will be looking forward to hearing from you!

**1260** handsome sophisticated stalkers for **1** year.

Today's feature is a fan club of sorts for a special actress. Her mind has been altered and mysterious men are out to get her. She is a paranoid schizophrenic

I'm here with **ALL 5** mods from r/SummerGlau and I ask them silly questions. I wanna hear what you guys think out there? Don't be shy

&gt;#1 What got you to like / love / worship Summer Glau?

&gt;&gt; **arcturussage** The first time I saw Summer was on The 4400. I had loved the show and something about her character stood out for me. I think I may had even seem some of The Sarah Conner Chronicles before I saw Firefly. I was really late to the whole Firefly/Serenity bandwagon.

&gt;&gt; **vasarih** I (like most people) first noticed her in Firefly

&gt;&gt; **Anonymo** I can't really remember when I started to like Summer Glau, where I thought she was attractive, talented and charming. I do remember getting hooked on Sarah Connor Chronicles though, this is when I remember actually wanting to know more about her, then I decided to start the subreddit, as a way to collect my findings and as a way of grouping the fans together, to pool the wealth of pics and news on Summer's career. I'm glad I did this

&gt;&gt; **KortoloB** I think that she's a great actress who has played some very lovable and kick-ass roles, she is a very nice person who is deeply thankful to her fans.

&gt;&gt; **DroneBzzz** Because of the roles she plays. I don't think it's possible to form a valid opinion of Summer or anyone just going by the things written about her and the interviews, of whom she clearly is one, but Summer just caught my eye. I am always incredibly happy when I see her on a show and she's definitely a reason to watch anything.

&gt;#2 What is your favorite character Summer Glau has played? why?

&gt;&gt; **arcturussage** Probably her role in The 4400. I loved the show and it was the first role I saw her in. You never forget your first.

&gt;&gt; **vasarih** My favorite big role of hers is obviously Cameron from The Sarah Chronicles. In my opinion her best one off was her recent role in Alphas. I thought it was pretty fantastic.

&gt;&gt; **Anonymo** As much as I like River Tam, ass-kicking with super-powers girl, for nostalgic reasons, I started watching her on Terminator. I grew up with the first and second Terminator movies, the second, which I have watched many many times. The third one was tolerable only because it had the girl terminator. The show took the best of the 3rd movie (the girl terminator) and made it something I could watch for an hour a week. Also, being a fan or connoisseur of attractive girls with big eyes, dark hair and light skin doesn't hurt.

&gt;&gt; **KortoloB** I loved Cameron, that's for sure. Damn Fox.. That's not to say that her other roles aren't equally amazing, particularly River from Firefly and Serenity.

&gt;&gt; **DroneBzzz** River. No contest. First time I saw her as an actress, too. But River resonates more with me.

&gt;#3 Tell us about r/SummerGlau community. What do you like about it most.

&gt;&gt; **vasarih** It might sound a bit cheesy

&gt;&gt; **Anonymo** The community has been great. I think the quality that I like the most is the respect everyone has for Summer. Even though most people here have the biggest crush or love for her, but she has so much more to offer. She's genuine and has a beautiful personality as well. She loves her career, which shows on screen and also, sadly, when she is hurt by some awful comments that arise sometimes. But I think the true fans really come through for her and treat and value her as a great person/actress and all-around beautiful person.

&gt;&gt; **KortoloB** I like the sense of community we have got going and the fact that we try to keep the subreddit respectful to Glau

&gt;&gt; **DroneBzzz** I like how there's always something to discuss. Shows that have ended are kept alive that way. Usually the immersion within a particular universe ends after the ~43 minutes of playtime an episode has have run out

&gt;#4 If you could go out on a date with Summer Glau

&gt;&gt; **arcturussage** Probably a whiskey bar or the Makers Mark factory. She's said she's a big fan of makers mark.

&gt;&gt; **vasarih** I'm not delusional, I guess I would take her out horseback riding in the rockies, somewhere west of Rocky Mountain House. I know of a big vale where there are actually wild horses and mountain goats. It's breathtaking. If that couldn't convince her on a second date, I guess I would just have to give up.

&gt;&gt; **Anonymo** I would take her to our hometown, so probably head over to Sea World. Or if she wants to, we could go to Six Flags or the Alamo. If it's a Summer day, ;D, we could go tubing in the river in our bathing suits ;D. Later in the night, we could go for a romantic boat ride on the river walk.

&gt;#5 Show me your favorite pic / video of Summer Glau. Do it now.

&gt;&gt; **KortoloB** [1](http://k.min.us/iyfis1ivWtImI.jpg) I cannot possibly pick one image as my favorite, a little bit of a sexy side and the fact that it's shot on a beach in the summer. The photoshoot is called ""The Summer (Glau) Preview"", one of the many obvious plays on her name.

&gt;&gt; **DroneBzzz** A very hard thing to choose. I went through a lot of HR images

&gt;#6 Anything you like to add?

&gt;&gt; **arcturussage**I'm sure mentioning it will cause more harm than good but I would want to let people know that Summer really doesn't like all of the ""curse"" rumors. People say it jokingly but she has said once you start to see it enough times you start to wonder if it's true. You're welcome to make the joke but if you do you'll probably get oranged with this response Haha. I get it. Because it's Summer Glau and she's cursed!

&gt;&gt; **Anonymo** I hope people enjoy their visit at /r/SummerGlau and watch all the new Summer Glau projects that have recently been released or will be release in the near future.

&gt;&gt; **KortoloB** Thanks for picking us as the Subreddit of the Day!

Here's how things work at Subreddit of the Day.  We're a finely tuned, we believe that if we're making a difference in one person's life each day, then it's all worth it.  And no, I have no explanation for the squid porn.  I did not see that coming.

**UkuleleNoGood**:  The brains of the operation.  Like a chessmaster, but that's the way that UNG plays it.  All future plans are pointless, all ideas are futile.  UkuleleNoGood has been there and back and reveals his or her plan only bits at a time... as much as our normal minds would allow (you know, safety first).  So enlightened is UkuleleNoGood, so brilliant.

**SidtheMagicLobster**:  The brawn. Have you noticed the peace and harmony on Subreddit of the Day?  Now you understand the importance of SidtheMagicLobster.  Sid has brought the magic of 1989's Roadhouse and taught us the ways of the Swayz, take it outside. Never start anything inside the bar unless it's absolutely necessary. And three, be nice.""  At any given moment, we are all moments away from a flurry to the solar plexus.  Namaste.

**Jaxspider**:  The faceman.  Charming, Jax always knows a guy.  How, I don't want to know, but whatever you need, Jax can get it.  Sometimes too popular with the ladies for his own good, always dressed his best, Jax always gets the job done.  With a little time left over for lovin'.

What this team was lacking was a thief who didn't mind getting his hands dirty.  Someone who's willing to go in and has some experience with execution. Someone with a cool pair of gloves...

Meet the newest member of Subreddit of the Day's Mod Team:  **jmk4422**.

Raised by strangers, or misspent youth, on the contrary.  We welcome it.  Got a problem, something done that you'd not like to be associated with, it's taken care of.  One call.

As a way of thanking jmk4422 for joining the mod team

&gt;I'm perplexed. How did a subreddit about a book become so popular? 6

&gt;&gt;It was simple

&gt;&gt;Just kidding. Our community has so many ~~readers~~ crows because the series of books are amazing, A Dance with Dragons was recently published also got our /r/ a lot of attention.

&gt;&gt;Most of all, yet cordial, debate. I've never been part of a community on the Internet before where so many people are willing to say, ""Hmm, you know, you make a good point. Maybe I was wrong about that."" Usually people stick to their opinions no matter what and flame-wars begin when someone dares make an unpopular or controversial post. On the Wall (/r/asoiaf) we're not like that.

&gt;&gt;Another factor is that while some of the top-voted posts in our /r/'s history were meme-related (cartoons, 99% of them find no success at /r/asoiaf. Our readers tend to upvote interesting discussions and debates rather than ""silly content"". For the record, I personally love a lot of the ""silly content"" but I also love the fact that our community is so serious minded about actual discussions that only the best of the best ""silly"" stuff ever rises to the top. Asking the dumbest question about one of the books will likely earn you a couple dozen upvotes while posting a lame or so-so rage comic will get you downvoted into oblivion.

&gt;&gt;Final thought on what makes us so successful: we have an awesome [spoiler-code policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/hynva/a_new_spoiler_policy_for_us_crows/) that the community debated before it was implemented. It's not perfect, and I love that our community is so passionate about keeping the place safe for everybody.


&gt;Why is this series so popular? For those of us who haven't read it

&gt;&gt;The books are so popular because they're awesome (spoken like a true fanboy

&gt;&gt;In all seriousness, fully-fleshed and three-dimensional characters in all of modern fiction. His world is so detailed that I often find that I know more about it than the one I actually live in, and the books are so well written that they transcend its own genre. Many of Martin's fans had never read a fantasy book before a relentless friend or family member basically forced them to read A Game of Thrones (the first book in the series). For example, when I asked my dad to read the first book I got him to do so by saying, ""Just read the first hundred pages. If you want to stop after that, feel free."" and then applying a lot of guilt to get him to actually do it. My dad is one of those guys who is always reading something, but he's not exactly a sci-fi or fantasy fan. He usually sticks more to suspense/thrillers, literature, its characters

&gt;&gt;The books are about political intrigue in a fictional world where summers can last for years and winters can last even longer. The thing that really sets them apart from most fantasy novels is that everything just feels real. I like Tolkien as much as the next guy but, it's hard sometimes to imagine such a world could really exist. In Martin's world, on the other hand, we see a true reflection of our own: men and women vying for political power, sons betraying fathers, lovers having their hearts broken, justice being done, though

&gt;&gt;I'd say more about the books but


&gt;Maybe it's the same question

&gt;&gt;I think I already covered the former question so I'll just address the latter one. You would subscribe to /r/asoiaf if you're curious about the books, make predictions, and speculate about all the dozens of ongoing plots and sub-plots. On book three and don't understand why Jane Stark would betray John Lannister? Make a post about it. You'll get lots of replies, sometimes people citing fact, sometimes people just speculating (the latter always happens when there's no ""fact"" yet to cite! The series isn't over yet, after all!).

&gt;&gt;Also, Lord of the Rings, or ASOIAF, turn into assholes around people new to their particular passion. Example:

&gt;&gt;Timmy: ""Wow

&gt;&gt;Geek-Hipster: ""Pff. That was not 'awesome'. That was a piece of garbage

&gt;&gt;Timmy: **sniff**

&gt;&gt;You don't see a lot of that at /r/asoiaf. We're geeks

&gt;&gt;Final thought on why you should subscribe? We're all incredibly good looking


&gt;I understand that your subreddit went from few readers to many community members in a short amount of time. How did this happen?

&gt;&gt;It just sort of snowballed.

&gt;&gt;The community was established by our Lord Commander, /r/fantasy, etc) and ask for links on their sidebars. That brought us some more members. Then I (poorly) redesigned the /r/ with my (poor) CSS skills and that seemed to grow us a bit, too. What really did it was a combination of two things: the publication of A Dance with Dragons (which fans have been waiting for for nearly six years) and the introduction of...


&gt;You've got one of the more interesting and attractive subreddits

&gt;&gt;...Deodrus! He's our style maester. He completely overhauled our entire CSS code, I have to say, is freaking awesome: totally automated, over 350+ shields to choose from... it's mind blowing what the guy pulled off!). When he first became a mod I think we had about 3,000 crows; in the short time since his arrival that has more than doubled. I have to think that the amazing work he's done with our CSS and artwork is part of the reason. People stumble across us and just have to frontpage us because everything looks so freakin' sweet!

&gt;Please ask your own question here! What do you want to ask jmk4422?

&gt;&gt;What's the best

&gt;&gt;The best: being part of such a great team. ThePowerOfGeek, but the debates and discussions that go on behind the scenes would make your head spin. This /r/ wouldn't be half of what it is without them.

&gt;&gt;The worst: banning people and removing posts. I always hate having to do it, I always wonder: did I do the right thing? Did this person really deserve a ban? Did this post really deserve to be removed? Thankfully, bannings have been incredibly rare and removed posts usually result in the crow responsible for it understanding why I had to do it, and re-submitting said post in a more proper way (a different title, etc).

Thanks very much for joining us for NSFW week!  As you can imagine, you might say!  A bit of backstory, we had discussed our NSFW week idea way back when we were getting the mod team off the ground.  Easily within 2 days of our recruitment drive, mods were asking, ""can we feature teh smut?!""  The idea was bounced around and we decided that yes, we'd feature boob sites once we'd hit 5,000 subscribers.  Sort of a gift to the team for working so hard.  We hope you enjoy this great week, we're not sure!  Will we have other NSFW sites from now on as a regular part of subredditoftheday?  Possibly!  And I'm hoping we'll have other theme weeks too 'cause it's so darn fun!   If you have any suggestions

Less talk

r/happygirls immediately popped into my head as my first choice for my NSFW subreddit to feature.  This subreddit just speaks to me &amp; I can't quite put my finger on it.... wait!  It's all those damn happy girls!  Oi, and nobody ever fuckin calls, and B-A-M!  r/happygirls makes eeeeverything alright.

Who wants to see a room full of round guys ? Jiggle please.   Nope.  I've never been remotely let down by r/happygirls.

Barring some sort of coup by Ron Paul, and things are really heating up. Romney just picked a disciple on matters such as fiscal budgets and fastidious hair care. And I'm not a betting man, but it wouldn't surprise me if Biden bit someone at the debates.

For this Sunday, but at the same time you have the distant, unattainable aura of a celebrity.  In short, you're well seen but not well known. The scraps of insight into the mysterious men who worked in the White House are few and far in between- personal accounts, papers/recordings, and photographs.

Today's featured subreddit focuses on these bits of knowledge, and the moments that are still having an effect today. 

But of course, can put it best. Interview below:

_____

&gt;You recently revived this subreddit. What are your goals and aspirations for /r/Presidents?

&gt;&gt;My goal is for the subreddit to become a place where people with interest in Presidential history can come together and discuss it. As of now we are mostly interesting pictures of former Presidents. In the future I hope we will have more questions and discussions. I also hope we can have a book review thread set-up once our membership grows.

&gt;What do you find so interesting about the role of president? Which president do you find most interesting?

&gt;&gt;The fact that the President is the face of the nation has always amazed me. When people around the world think of America there's a good chance President Bush or President Obama's face comes to their mind.

&gt;&gt;Also the huge role they have as head of our Executive branch. The way they leverage their power to get things through a divided congress and raise awareness about certain issues is fascinating.

&gt;&gt;I find Franklin Delano Roosevelt to be the most interesting. He came to power in very hard times

&gt;Which president do you think is most overrated? Underrated?

&gt;&gt;'m definitely not a Presidential scholar by any means but I have always thought President Kennedy was overrated. Aside from the Cuban Missile Crisis I have a hard time thinking of major events during his Presidency. I think the reason he is held in such high esteem is due to his assassination. My pick for most underrated President is Lyndon B. Johnson. He gets a lot of flack for the Vietnam war and this causes people to sometimes overlook the other things he did. Such as Civil Rights, Medicaid, Public radio and television, federal aid for education, etc.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Presidents?

Having trouble suppressing your long-suppressed bloodlust? Of course you are! Like the feeling of god-like superiority over another creature? If you're like me

MOTHERFUCKING [/r/BUGWARS](/r/bugwars)

This subreddit, arachnid assaults, and insect infighting on the internet. Each video holds all the awesome of a luchador wrestling match, with the tense stakes of a gladiator fight. And we already know all the winners: HUMANS! Join me, fellow sociopath, in the celebration of insects battling eachother, instead of teaming up to take our species out. 

Everyone's favorite SROTD alum

&gt;What inspired you to create /r/BugWars?

&gt;&gt;syn:It was actually [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTEIMDb5qfg) that was submitted to /r/WTF a little over 7 months ago. That same day I learned of the show ""Bug Wars"" on the Discovery channel and started watching the clips on youtube. I thought it would be interesting to create a subreddit that collected these types of videos

&gt;Why do insect battles appeal to you?

&gt;&gt;syn:As a child I always enjoyed feeding the tunnelweb spiders that made their homes in the bushes outside my house the occasional cricket or woodlouse and watching them devour their prey. I love animals

&gt;&gt;ser:My two cents on why /r/bugwars and insect brawls are appealing:

&gt;&gt;Watching insects fight to the death is pretty humbling. My daily routine rarely (read: never) involves actual life or death struggles


&gt;Hypothetical situation #1: There's a BugWar tournament taking place. It features all of the world's most versatile and violent bugs. 2 insects enter

&gt;&gt;syn:The winner of any tournament would most definitely be a [common house centipede](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sankax/3261323025/lightbox/) (note: this fucker might be in your basement right now). I teach at an after school program, woodlice (known as potato bugs around here), other spiders... until one day we found this [insect spawn of satan](http://i.imgur.com/ORUup.jpg).

&gt;&gt;""Feed it to the spider!"" my kids said... so we put him in the bug catcher. Little did we know what would happen. Mr. Centipede walked right up to the spider with a cold indifference

&gt;Hypothetical situation #2: Another tournament, for yourself, to make the fight fairer. (Example: black widow venom, huge mantis arms) Which insect trait do you pick?

&gt;&gt;syn:Obviously I would want to have the ferocity of a house centipede so I can rip off the heads of my enemies and start munching on their insides.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/BugWars?

&gt;&gt;syn: If you want to see more videos

Gather around kids

Interview reply is on its way... hopefully. In the mean time

&gt; ## Whats your Favorite role Ricky Gervais has been in?
&gt;&gt;David Brent from the UK office

&gt;&gt;&gt;Series creators Gervais and Merchant claim that Brent is not a horrible person, which drives him to act the way he does to get attention. By the end of the second series his true colours are shown and he is much more sympathetic, no more so than when he breaks down when he is about to be made redundant and practically begs for his job back. Word Of God also says that the character of Chris Finch was introduced so Brent would appear less of a wanker by comparison.
Brent's 'Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist' status was also lampshaded and explored in The Office Christmas Specials as being at least partially a consequence of the Mockumentary format of the show; he bitterly notes how the documentary crew 'stitched him up' in order to make him look bad

&gt;&gt;[Source](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist)


&gt; ## What was your reaction the first time you saw Ricky Gervais in action. And I'm not talking about his [singing carrier.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnogGv3UVok)

&gt;&gt; I can't remember really. I think I vaguely knew about the office and had seen it on television briefly but I didn't really get it or find it particularly funny.

&gt; ## Do you think Ricky Gervais is presently the best comedian out there? Can you name some comedians that he stands shoulder to shoulder with. If not

&gt;&gt; Best comedian is a difficult title to give to someone as I think everyone has different tastes in comedy etc. But he certainly is one of my favourites. I also love Louie CK, Jimmy Carr. I also think Karl Pilkington is hirlarious but I don't think he sees himself as a comedian. I haven't heard enough of Steve as a standup to judge, but I'll definitely buy his DVD of his current standup tour when it comes out. He's hilarious in the podcasts, but difficult to compete alongside Ricky and Karl.

&gt; ## Do you like fit hipster Ricky or shaved chubby Ricky? Why? (This is a serious question!)

&gt;&gt; Chubby Ricky because I think his best work has been the UK office

&gt; ## Anything else you'd like to add? Maybe something about your community?

&gt;&gt; You can make Philosokarl images appear in the comments on r/rickygervais by following this tutorial. Philosokarl is a mixture of the meme philosoraptor and Karl Pilkington. People don't use Philosokarl very much. I'm not sure if it's because they don't know about it or if they do but don't want to use it.

I want to thanks **radiohead_fan123** for responding in a...

#####timely fashion.

Relentlessly.

/r/Seattle is quite the amazing subreddit that never stops trying.  If the score was tied with 2 minutes on the clock, the clock is ticking, they're one man short, we're all tied up with one minute, forty-five seconds on the clock.  /r/Seattle is looking ponderous, waiting for his big chance and there he goes!  /r/Seattle passes left to /r/Portland, /r/Portland heads up the side narrowly missing an elbow by /r/Toronto, /r/Portland to /r/Vancouver

These redditors over at /r/Seattle just don't let up - they have so much to offer!  Here to discuss all the stuff you'll find there is *careless*

&gt;Please tell us what makes /r/Seattle such a great place.

&gt;&gt;Friendly people, and insightful debate in the comments.

&gt;I understand you have sub-subreddits. Please share these with us.

&gt;&gt;We have so many

&gt;&gt;- [/r/SeattleEnts](/r/seattleents) for trees and those who ~~hug~~ smoke them.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/SeaList](/r/sealist) for Craigslist style posts.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/SeaJobs](/r/seajobs) for job listings.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/UDub](/r/udub) for folks at the University of Washington.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/KEXP](/r/kexp) is a local radio station that is amazing.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/Eastside](/r/eastside) is not Seattle

&gt;&gt;- [/r/Washington](/r/washington) for state-wide news.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/Cascadia/](/r/cascadia) a better name for the Pacific NW.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/Seahawks/](/r/seahawks) for fans of our football team.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/Mariners/](/r/mariners) for fans of our baseball team.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/SoundersFC/](/r/soundersfc) for fans of our soccer team.

&gt;&gt;- [/r/SeattleMusicScene](/r/seattlemusicscene) for music events around town.

&gt;Can you tell us more about the meetups? Who sets them up

&gt;&gt;We have a great community of folks making meet-ups happen. I don't think we've had more than a day without meet-ups being listed in the /r/Seattle sidebar. Coming in the future for /r/Seattle meetups: A joint twitter account for a weekly happy hour pub meet-up, Pub Crawls &amp; Drinking, Beer &amp; Code - two different nights.

&gt;Many location-based subreddits suffer from too many complaint posts. That is

&gt;&gt;Folks complain about the weather, including people complaining about complaining... but we can still get along. I like to think that we're community of folks who can disagree and still remain a community.

&gt;What question did I not ask and what is your answer to that great question?

It's an incredibly friendly and supportive place... even for [republicans](/r/conservative).

So look

Aw yiss!  /r/steamfriend is incredibly new

Here to discuss the great things that happen at /r/steamfriend is head mod and creator

&gt;Please explain /r/steamfriend. How does it work?

&gt;&gt;/r/steamfriend is for people with steam to find people to play with. I've seen a lot of stories about how people have little to no friends on steam because of the nature of the platform, hopefully making for a more quality experience.

&gt;Since you're a newer subreddit

&gt;&gt;Just a couple of rules:

&gt;&gt;No Spam.          
No Meme's/Ragecomic's/Image Micro's.         
Spread the Subreddit any time you deem would fit.          
Don't only post your thread

&gt;&gt;I've also been trying to enforce a title format

&gt;How did steamfriend get started? Give us the book of Genesis.

&gt;&gt;Basically, while a decent subreddit. Being that steam can have 4 million concurrent players, I figured a friend finder just for steam would be good for people, seeing as it is very hard to find players.

&gt;I noticed there's a ton of posts

&gt;&gt;Lack of comments are usually fine

&gt;Final paragraph belongs to you 

&gt;&gt;I have some big plans for /r/steamfriend, where people have a common game that interests them, and thus streamlining the process to find people. Also I envision making the subreddit look better, visually, adding a Teamspeak or Mumble server and finally having gaming nights where we have a predetermined night and play various games. I have many plans for it, so if you have steam, you should defiantly check out /r/steamfriend!

*This is it*

Watts flicked the key out the ignition. The mangled Range Rover let out a rumbling breath

The hastily prepared path ended here. Towering mounds or rubble and wreckage stood over him like sentinels. He pulled a 2x4 from the bottom of one of the piles and, Watts saw his destination in the distance: a tattered church, its front entirely torn away, blackened boards gaping down from the top of the whole like errant, crooked teeth. Still, it was one of the few landmarks in the area to retain a resemblance of structure. 

Watts saw the cluster of machines, scarf,  and impromptu walking stick he looked much more a bohemian hiking hipster than a ""government official"". He smiled and started on the way down.

At the entrance Watts pressed his hands to his mouth and exhaled, and toward the circle of beeping machines. The man, (*Jameson, his name's Jameson*) sat on the floor,  his legs splayed out before him like a child playing. He was intent on his laptop on the ground before him, and would pause occasionally to take notes on the pad beside him. 

Jameson shuffled the notes beside him and handed them to Watts without looking up. Watts pulled a folder out the jacket's front, and asked, ""This what you've been up to?""

Jameson looked up

Watts flipped through the papers. ""And..."" 

""San Francisco is fairly well off- compared to the rest. Chicago's fires are going out, but the descriptions seem to be pretty uniform. Many places, likeScranton and St. Louis, don't seem to have enough order or electricity to  report back anything. ""

""Or it's too dangerous to be doing anything but watching your hide.""

""That's a distinct possibility.""

There was a moment of silence. Watts looked up at the rafters,

""Kansas City looks a bit different than when I visited as a kid.""

""That it does."" Jameson distractedly murmured. ""I don't even think of it as ""Kansas City"" anymore. ""Golgotha"" seems much more appropriate.""

This statement troubled Watts. *Right on the nose, and masks, and sanitizer, and finally the desperate shellings, all done in the name of disease prevention, hadn't stopped the anomalous plague. Rather, whatever strange forces that had brought the rotting automatons to life had slowed down

Furthermore, or ""appointed"", or something, to his current position... simply because he *was* left and *could* pick up the pieces. The novelty of anarchy had worn off for him, but he didn't think that was true for everyone. He felt that the stillness that had come over the place formerly known as Kansas City in the past few weeks was strictly, tragically, temporary.

In this moment of meditation and doubt

""What'd you find- ooh

Watts noticed now what page Jameson was on.

""/r/2012Zombieevents: regarding the 2012 zombie outbreak""

Watts' eyes widened as he scanned the subreddit from the beginning. dog bites man, man bites *100 men*- the posts becoming increasingly dire, until they had cut out entirely about 2 months previously. Jameson was near tears, and his voice hitched abruptly.

""If we had-had seen the signs, we could have done more. We could have done *something*.""

&gt;What sparked your interest in zombies? What do you think is the most disturbing aspect of them? 

&gt;&gt;bugeyedbaggins:My original interest in zombies came from video games, they're a criticism on humanity as a whole. The idea that zombies are a mass of beings that are all consuming, unthinking, and have the primal ability to add to their group by ""infecting"" (ie: biting) speaks of the mass-consumer society that is reliant on people with similar interests or to be in a kind of group. Also, just a side note, but I always thought of the bullet to the brain of a zombie (or what's left of the brain) as a metaphor for giving the masses original ideas and free-thought, literally ""blowing their minds"".

&gt;What are the telltale signs of a zombie infection? 

&gt;&gt;beb:I guess it would depend on what lore of zombies you want to go by. You have your classic ""Moonlight Zombies""; the kind that are slow-moving with their arms outstretched and have a habit of eating brains

&gt;What can one do to avoid being infected? 

&gt;&gt;beb:This was always my personal thought: First; educate yourself and prepare accordingly. Second; If you can keep them from biting you, then a human can't. Then again, this is assuming mosquitoes can't transfer a ""Zombie Virus"". If so, we're pretty much fucked.

&gt;What is your favorite zombie movie? Which one do you think is the most accurate? 

&gt;&gt;beb:My all-time favorite movie would have to be ""Return of the Living Dead"" directed by Dan O'Bannon simply for the fact that it is horrifying. It's a perfect example of humanity dooming themselves by doing something they think will benefit them. Also, I don't think any movie has it right because every person in a zombie movie is completely stupid. No real person would act like that in those situations. They need to make a movie that is a mix of ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and ""Red Dawn"" with people who are wolverines.

&gt;Anything you'd like to plug/promote? 

&gt;&gt;beb:8 O'Clock coffee and a percolator.

Today, I present you with (drum roll please) [r/randomactsofcoffee](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofcoffee)! You guys must really think I’m coffee crazy. A few weeks ago, I featured [r/coffeewithjesus](http://www.reddit.com/r/coffeewithjesus) and now this! I swear I’m not crazy…entirely. Anyway, just like the name suggests, here’s a nice community where you can give, and talk about coffee all you want. I know not all of you are coffee drinkers like me (seriously, so here’s [oldworldcafe](http://www.reddit.com/user/oldworldcafe) to talk about it some more.

&gt;What gave you the idea to start this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;The idea came from random acts of pizza and r/coffee. I always was on r/coffee and people complained about finding good coffee/not being able to afford it. I hate seeing people drink low end coffee as it is quite bad for you and figured we could get some home roasters and the like to donate a few batches here and there. I am glad to see it grow into a bit more than that

&gt;I don't think people really know low end coffee is bad for you (I sure as hell didn't). Can you elaborate on that a little more?

&gt;&gt;Coffee is great for you and some consider it a super food. However, but as a roaster I know why this is.

&gt;Is it r/randomactsofcoffee just coffee exchanges or are there other things people requesting/giving?

&gt;&gt;Anything coffee related. I know someone sent an electric kettle across the states at some point

&gt;Kinda sounds like you're in the coffee business IRL. Are you?

&gt;&gt;I live and work as a roaster. I work alone

&gt;Now the question we’ve all been waiting for. What is reddit blend?

&gt;&gt;I roast to order so anyone who places an order with us can get their coffee fresh. I roast in small batches as well. Whenever you order

I got mod **antidense** to take a few minutes off from pondering about the past to answer a few questions.

&gt;What can one find at r/nostalgia?

&gt;&gt;Toys, the best posts are things that we once loved but nearly forgot about, e.g. scholastic book orders. It's also an awesome feeling sharing in nostalgia with other people on the internet for things that were less widespread, like certain video games.

&gt;What decade do you feel most nostalgic about?

&gt;&gt; The 90s, but there were still family shows around too, like Full House and Family Matters. Also, I think toys were in an era where they could take advantage of technology, e.g. race car tracks, but at the same time weren't neutered down so much out of safety concerns.

&gt;What do you love most about being a mod?

&gt;&gt;It's exciting to watch the subreddit grow! A lot of these submissions originally went to /r/pics

Todays pick for subreddit of the day was very easy for me.  I have been a fan of this band for a long time and according to /radiohead there are another 3


After a great conversation between myself


**Please describe r/radiohead.**

&gt;&gt;r/radiohead is a subreddit focused on Radiohead's music as well as a news source for Radiohead info

**Toughest question I can think of... Discuss Radiohead's significant contributions to popular music - you are only allowed to name 3 or fewer!**

&gt;&gt;It's really hard to pick just three but I can kind of summarize:

&gt;&gt;Most Radiohead fans and even critics would agree that OK Computer was one of the most (if not the most) influential albums of the nineties.

&gt;&gt;Following OK Computer was the Kid A and Amnesiac albums which took a complete different approach which caught many off guard but ultimately became very receptive albums.

&gt;&gt;In Rainbows was one of the first successful attempts at releasing an album without a record contract through the internet.

**Easy question. For those who have yet to discover Radiohead

&gt;&gt;We can't speak for the group but if you were to require a few songs I'd say the group favorites are [Paranoid Android](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPLEbAVjiLA)

**Please tell us about your community members!**

&gt;&gt;We have a great group of ever growing people who I find very easy to moderate. We rarely have to step in on anything and in general are very nice and courteous of one another. I'd say we have become one of the top Radiohead resources for news. One of our members even had a[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-cfWYN0cZI) featured on the official Radiohead website.

**What's your favourite thing about r/radiohead?**

&gt;&gt;I've been moderating the subreddit since there was only about ten subscribers and have really been impressed with how steadily it has grown since The King Of Limbs was released. Just last Monday we had about six thousand impressions and continue to pull in an average of about twenty subscribers a day. The community is amazing and there is much love from all of us mods.

Hello! I was planning on writing/singing the intro as a song but I figured that was a bit too cheesy. Instead I wrote and recorded a song that was supposed to be meant for this post but with proper lyrics

[Doctors of Cardiff- Newspaper](http://soundcloud.com/jmusic-1/newspaper)

Songwriting, either by myself or with others. When it comes to songwriting there are a ton of different approaches you can take, which makes songwriting so interesting. I personally like to fiddle around on my guitar until a song forms. Songs are weird, they can start off as a simple melody and take different shapes and regenerations as time goes on. I usually have a certain song stuck in my head that I want to write and after a few hours of arranging it turns into this whole different sounding beast.  
/r/Songwriters is a great subreddit to check out fellow redditor’s musical endeavors.


&gt;##1. What made you decide to come up with a subreddit dedicated to songwriting?

&gt;&gt; **Gribbly**: I didn't! I was a songwriter and a redditor

&gt;&gt; **Wekulm**: The only subreddit related at the time was /r/wearethemusicmakers and they were all so much better than I was and the subreddit didn't seem focused on what songwriters like

&gt;##2. What is your favorite part of songwriting?

&gt;&gt; **Gribbly**: The initial inspiration - realizing there's a melody stuck in my head and I think it's a new one. And finishing a song is really satisfying. When you know it's done. So the beginning and the end is great... it's the middle part that's tough.

&gt;&gt; **Wekulm**: The puzzle of it all. 15 years ago before I had ever written a song I often thought to myself, what they did. Then one day I thought, ""damn, I can write a better song than these yoyo's"". Man, was I wrong. That is the joy of songwriting to me, the challenge that it has provided me over the years to write a good song. It seems like such an easy thing to do when you sit down with guitar in hand and pen to paper, it is anything but easy. I see songs as a puzzle to put together, where ""good"" cannot be defined.

&gt;##3. What do you do to coax more songs out of yourself?

&gt;&gt; **Gribbly**: Collaborate

&gt;&gt; **Wekulm**:  I don't. I've learned over the years that there is no coaxing the song out, that line pops into your head, and then the next line does, and the line after that, and it all seems so natural and unforced you've got to grab a pen and paper and keep it going but you're busy doing something else and you shouldn't be spending an hour or two scribbling down silly lines but you know that if you don't do it at that very moment that it will be gone and that great song will be gone forever right along with it.

&gt;##4. Who are your favorite songwriters and why?

&gt;&gt; **Gribbly**: I've always been a fan of David Bowie

&gt;&gt; **Wekulm**: Townes Van Zandt (hands down) because no one else yanks the emotion out of my insides like he was able to do. Bob Dylan: Because his lyrics are so mind-blowingly complicated and subtle at the same time. James McMurtry: Because he puts a story to words better than any other writer I've ever heard

&gt;##5. What instruments do you play and what instruments do you want to learn?

&gt;&gt; **Gribbly**: I mainly play guitar and ""computer"" (I'm a Propellerhead Reason fanatic). Would love to learn the saxophone.

&gt;&gt; **Wekulm**: I play guitar and I can blow a harmonica as well as a two year old. My in-laws bought me a fiddle for Christmas that I've so far failed to learn

&gt;##6.Is there anything you want to say to potential subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Gribbly**: Come join in - give feedback

&gt;&gt; **Wekulm**: Critique, I mean, when you know they sat there for two hours listening to your song over and over again to pick up all the different aspects and all the subtlety's that you took the time to put into your music that are son easily missed by a casual listen. The kind of subtlety's that you only pick up on after listening to the same artist for years and having memorized every note and every word of a song. Also, I want other songwriters to know how much offering this kind of critique for another songwriter will vastly improve your own songwriting because when you've critiqued someone else's song in a genuine manner, the next time you sit down and are writing your song those same thoughts creep into your mind (whether you know or not) and improve your own writing more than you can imagine.

Big thanks to Gribbly  and Wekulm.

604 chasers

Ever since childhood, or the hint of menace, the chance that if you play your cards wrong your life can get turned upside down, left, right, and discarded half a mile away. At every opportunity, I'd run out with a camera to capture all the lightning flashes I could see. I still have quite a few books on the subject. And I may or may not have gotten an autograph from one of the local weather men. :) But I digress.

What I *do* know is that I'm certainly not alone. Although tornado research has been ongoing since the 60's/70's

Storm chasing isn't for everyone- if you can't find your way around a map on a good day

/u/cuweathernerd couldn't be around today- in case you didn't know

*(Edit: post now with 30% more cuweathernerd!)*

&gt;What first sparked your interest in severe weather?

&gt;&gt;P: I've always been interested in weather in general

&gt;&gt;cuwn: I distinctly remember the May 4th, and it was really foggy and cloudy and cool -- it didn't really feel like a tornado kind of day. That changed pretty fast, and I remember being in my basement and watching the TV signal (this makes me sound old, and it was only 9 years ago...) go out as the tornado passed between the antenna and the tv tower. That was cool. It only passed a mile or two from my house, and I got to see firsthand the results. I think what really captured my imagination was that we could predict this. After that, it's a story of slowly getting out and getting my feet wet in college -- slowly learning the game and seeing results. And you know what? By sitting down with data I was able to predict today (with hundreds of others) -- and see a tornado firsthand. 

&gt;What causes the storm flare-ups we often see in the spring? Why does ""Tornado Alley"" exist?

&gt;&gt;P: The storm flare ups in the spring are for a combination of reasons. There is usually a lot more moisture in the atmosphere and winds in the spring help bring that moisture to wherever these storms occur (typically in the plains)

&gt;&gt;cuwn:This one is a little more complex.

&gt;&gt;To understand why tornado alley exists, moist air (low density). This causes significant rising motion as the dry air moves east, pushing the buoyant moist air upward. Moving moist air upward -- that's the fundamental root of all thunderstorms.

&gt;&gt;On the right days

&gt;&gt;Couple that with the Rockies, it spreads out because the amount of circulation in the tube is a conserved quantity (angular momentum). As it passes over the mountains, the bottom falls out, the tube narrows, and the rotation increases. This intensifies low pressure systems, which help to set up drylines and warm fronts, which are where tornadoes tend to hang out.

&gt;&gt;[I made this to try an show that too.](http://i.imgur.com/NfY5s.png). Think about it like a figure skater and her arms in the classic example.

&gt;&gt;There's a lot there -- and the details are what we try to discuss to try and figure out where we chase -- it's a very detailed and skill-requiring art and science. And a lot of fun. Good question!

&gt;Now

&gt;&gt;P: Both of us storm chase, but it sucked to be driving on a doughnut in significant hail.

&gt;&gt;cuwn:I guess you could call me that. I think of my role primarily as eyes that can provide ground truth to warning meteorologists and verification for their warnings. I'm also a first responder, I try and document the tornado -- both for personal reasons (tornadoes are sexy) and to help provide a complete picture of the storm.

&gt;&gt;As for the gnarliest storm -- I tend to chase weak, I've had a couple close calls getting away from big hail because I don't much care for hail meeting my car. 

&gt;What are some of the most important things to know while under a severe weather threat?

&gt;&gt;P: I think the most important thing is to stay at home. With the popularity that Storm Chasers brought to the hobby, you should have a weather radio on and listen to the warnings. Being safe is the most important thing.

&gt;&gt;cuwn: It sounds obvious

&gt;&gt;When it comes down to it

&gt;We've all heard of plucked chickens

&gt;&gt;P: There's been some crazy weather that's been recorded and I don't think I have a favorite. I do think that multi vortex tornadoes are cool. It's where a large tornado has multiple small tornadoes inside it.

&gt;&gt;cuwn: I like strange damage. [I think this is my favorite.](http://i.imgur.com/oGBNC.jpg) Think about the force required to do such a thing.

&gt;&gt;[A close runner up is this image from Joplin

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/stormrchasing?

&gt;&gt;P:I just want to say thanks and that I hope to see everyone get involved in discussion! I hope that this subreddit can help people learn how to chase safely and get people involved in the greater storm chasing community!

&gt;&gt;cuwn: To subsribers:Thank you! The only way to learn is to get out and do this -- but the skills you bring with you are critical. Make sure to have a grasp of meteorology -- especially radar meteorology -- and if you are taking others along

I can’t remember the first time I heard a Beatles song

r/Beatles is a neat subreddit to browse through whether you’re a hardcore Beatles fan or not. In all my years of loving the Fab Four, Alvin6226, and matkrill were kind enough to answer some questions. Enjoy!

&gt;At what age did you start listening to The Beatles and what made you fall in love with them (assuming that you love them since

&gt;&gt;**toefer:** My parents (my mom in particular) were fans

&gt;&gt;**Alvin6226:** Age 14 or so. Got the 1 album and had only that for the longest time... then got the full discography and met Please Please Me

&gt;&gt;**giggsy664:** 15, but I'd say Helter Skelter and Back In The USSR were the songs that got me hooked.

&gt;&gt;**matkrill: ** Around age 5


&gt;In your opinion what was the best thing to happen to The Beatles? And besides Yoko

&gt;&gt;**toefer:** Best thing that ever happened to them might've been meeting Brian Epstein. The worst was Brian Epstein dying unexpectedly.

&gt;&gt;**Alvin6226:** Best: Youth. A lot of people don't like their simple ‘I Love You la la la’ stuff but it really sticks to me at this point in my life. I recently fell in love with the song ""Your Mother Should Know"" on the Magical Mystery Tour album though.
Worst: The non-release of the Get Back album with the epic cover that mirrored the cover of the band’s first album (and of course greatest cover art)

&gt;&gt;**giggsy664:** Best: Quitting touring. It was the gateway to them venturing into psychedelics and their more experimental albums.
Worst: Epstein or Lennon's death. The former because it was a huge shake up for the group and sort of marking the beginning of the end

&gt;&gt;**matkrill: ** The best thing to happen to The Beatles, drugs and egos were the worst thing to happen to them.

&gt;If you were given the opportunity to spend a few days with one of the Fab Four, and why?

&gt;&gt;**toefer:** George, so it'd be interesting to get to know him during the height of their success.

&gt;&gt;**Alvin6226:** Pre-1965 Lennon...Please Please Me... If I Fell...Tell Me Why...I'm Happy Just To Dance With You...It Won't Be Long...YEAH

&gt;&gt;**giggsy664:** Ringo. Doesn't matter what year. Because he's the best.

&gt;&gt;**matkrill:** I'd mostly likely pick Paul during his depression and sweet bearding stage/long and winding road period. He seemed the most different from any of the other 3 at that time.

&gt;Do you believe the real Paul is dead and this one is just a look alike?

&gt;&gt;**toefer:**No. It's one of the dumber conspiracy theories I've heard of.

&gt;&gt;**Alvin6226:** No.

&gt;&gt;**giggsy664:** Nope

&gt;&gt;**matkrill:**A4-Paul isn't dead


&gt;One of the greatest and one of the most influential rock bands has had a subreddit for 2 years now but only has 1

&gt;&gt;**Alvin6226:** I took over the subreddit on the 7th of August this year... with 488 subscribers. Recruited these three guys and it took off (relatively) from there.

&gt;&gt;**giggsy664:** As far as I know, which isn't bad for any subreddit! I'd say the reason we took off was because of the new mods (not to be a circlejerk). We've done a good bit to improve the subreddit (Like adding a new banner, flair etc), and encouraging our subs to get involved helping or giving feedback to the mods.

&gt;&gt;**matkrill:** I don't think 1,276 people now haha. Hopefully more folks will join following the subreddit of the day. Also, as my fellow and wonderful mods have pointed out, over the summer we had a bit of a revamping and people began to have more of an interest.


&gt; What is (are) something(s) about The Beatles you wish everyone knew?

&gt;&gt;**Alvin6226:** Quite apparent in most English-speaking countries (I would hope)

&gt;&gt;**giggsy664:** I don't understand the question. I assume you mean little known facts about The Beatles we think should be known by everyone? In that case

&gt;&gt;**matkrill:** I'm not sure. Something that always kinda bothers me is that some people think that ""Imagine"" was a Beatle song. I'm sure there's more


Thank you mods! Remember folks

Instead of irrationally abusing my power in random ways

Beards don't seem to get the respect they deserve these days. Many people prefer the clean-shaven look. The closest thing to a popular beard these days is ""two day shadow"". Isn't there *someone* who still appreciates a good, go?

Without question, sometimes I feel like I'm paid way too much!

r/PropagandaPosters is a subreddit for those with an eye for art

Take it away wassworth!

&gt;Welcome to Subreddit of the Day! Please tell us a bit about yourself.

&gt;&gt;Thank you! I'm 18. I'm in trades school. I love punk and reggae music. I have an extensive propaganda collection covering my walls

&gt;What about your reddit life? Do you mod anywhere else? What subreddits do you normally frequent?

&gt;&gt;My reddit life is pretty debilitating. I'm an addict. I went traveling not long ago and wasn't on reddit for over a month. What an ordeal. I'm a mod for [/r/punk](http://www.reddit.com/r/punk). Some of my favourite subreddits are lectures, politicalhumor, lifeprotips, gue, todayilearned, and explainlikeimfive.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;A subreddit for propaganda collectors, sociology, perspective, and manipulation. In spite of the name, a variety of posters, cartoons, videos, news articles, horrific or hilarious.

&gt;How'd you get started on this project?

&gt;&gt;I created the subreddit over a year ago, and even I unsubscribed. Then a few months ago, I rediscovered it and started trying to get it to work for the first time. So, it's actually a pretty new subreddit. At first it was just me posting all the propaganda I have on my computer, and pictures of the posters on my walls, then as other people submitted good posts I would offer to make them mods if they kept posting.

&gt;One thing I like is the openness of submissions. You've got modern

&gt;&gt;I would really like a wide variety of submissions, news articles, movies, or books, claiming they're propaganda. I'd really like to see submissions that people disagree with or submissions challenging hivemind perspectives. Though sometimes people vote on whether or not they agree or disagree with the message, rather than how fascinating it is.

&gt;Is anything off limits? Any submissions been turned away by the mods?

&gt;&gt;I'd like to say nothing's off limits

&gt;Is it only posters - how about video?

&gt;&gt;The name's a bit of a problem. No, documentaries, songs, radio/loudspeaker broadcasts, news articles, and anything under the moon is welcome.

&gt;Any changes you'd like to see to r/propagandaposters? Any cool developments?

&gt;&gt;As I said, times, and perspectives. And I want it to be as much about finding and dissecting and discussing propaganda in our modern every day lives as it is about studying history's. Maybe a new banner by a more talented photoshop artist than myself, too.

The Ireland I grew up in was very different from the Ireland of today. It was a land of choc ices and holy communion; woolly (2 ""o""s and 2 ""l""s? strange word) jumpers and community center raffles. And only two television channels! Can you imagine? No internet, dinner at 5, the simpsons at 6, homework at 6.30 and then maybe an auld episode of friends to wind down the day at 9 or 10 or whatever. It was quite the shock, then, when [the blizzard of odd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J3YNZ5a9R4), a crazy hodgepodge of various televisual esoterica, ranging from home-grown attempts at horror and comedy (usually more horrible than the horror itself) to banned or controversial foreign films and ads. It quickly gained a cult following

*Get excited about it.*  You're doing it

*Commit publicly.*  Okay, go forth and spread the Good News!  Tell everyone about your plan - since it works well in musical theatre, it'll work for you.

*Get support.*  Now, and they wouldn't have to be people either!  [But where would you find them?](/r/challengeaccepted).

*Be smart aboot it.*   Look, and somedays you get Dick.  So don't be put off because happiness isn't having what you want, it's wanting what you have.  Like herpes.

*Once you cross the finish line, you've earned your spot on the podium.  You're the best!  Around!  Nothin's gonna ever keep you down!

**Challenge.  Accepted.**

This subreddit is phenominable!  Got a goal, and those who enjoy motivating others.  Once you're sufficiently helped achieve your challenge, you help others... pretty soon you got a mobius strip of support!  *Not a bad marketing catch phrase for bras if you asked me!  Good one Johnny!*

Without a doubt,000 suns!*  Yes, whether it's the mods I have the pleasure of working with, the mods of each subreddit we feature or The Beautiful People (our dear readers), I am truly humbled on a daily basis.

With this in mind, 'Laqueristas was and is nothing short of a church!  Their subscribers were easily some of the most grateful, most positive people in the world.  They see nail painting as artistic expression, as a challenging endeavour, and also as a peaceful break in their day and a meditative activity.  And the coolest part was their fondness for the great *Teatoly*, creator and moderator of RL.   This person did everything she could to cultivate an awesome community and all the readers respect her completely.  I fondly remember this feature and this experience because sometimes the things you do can have a very large impact on others.

So flash forward to yesterday.  I'm looking to contact the moderator of today's feature, but it totally means a whole lot to it's subscribers.  Tons of posts each day, tons of comment activity?  As a former hair owner I fail to see the interest in this topic - but it's there!  People are lovin' this subreddit!!  Another smashing success.  Here to discuss her year-old project is the magnanimous Teatoly!!

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;At FF, new techniques, style trends, coloring queries, and all things follicle related. It's a very welcoming community, open and honest with lots of support. 

&gt;What was the reason for starting this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;I started this subreddit because I was needing a place to discuss hair woes. At the time

&gt;When we did /r/RedditLaqueristas

&gt;&gt;I think the similarities of Lacqueristas and FF, buy henna (making my hair smell like mud for weeks!)and craft my own hair accessories. I know blow drying my hair can put me into a sort of zen state, where I gain clarity. All I am doing is pointing a hot element at my head, it gives me time think. And I can imagine it's the same for some. I know it can also give you a boost of confidence having great hair. It can change your perspective.

&gt;Any cool stories from /r/fancyfollicles you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;I love to see people trying new styles and it takes courage to try new things. Especially with hair cuts. I have seen quite a few girls take a leap of faith and cut off all their hair

&gt;Final thoughts? Anything you'd like to say to the subscribers or those about to subscribe?

&gt;&gt;I'd love to thank my community for being so easy going and really supportive. I know I haven't had a large presence and I am thankful that the community has thrived. I love seeing people finding their own styles!

After a certain age most people forget that unique, tearing open all the presents that Santa left for you. There's a certain wonder to it, a pure and unadulterated joy that can only be glimpsed at by adults by being around the children in their life on Christmas Morning. For the briefest of moments one suddenly remembers what it feels like to know that Santa has read your letter and left you presents as a result.  

Turns out that Santa isn't real, might not ever get to experience such wonders. Their parents and/or guardians, meanwhile, don't get to relive their childhoods either and instead spend the Christmas season stressed out and upset that they can't afford to play Santa for their loved ones. /r/RandomActsOfChristmas aims to help such people.

As the name implies

***

&gt;Would making a post requesting that someone bring me a big box of tacos and a bag full of money in your subreddit be acceptable?

&gt;&gt;**pookie85**: *No.* The purpose of Random Acts of Christmas is to give gifts to *children who otherwise would not have gotten a present to open on Christmas morning.* The inspiration for RAoC came from a post on /r/random_acts_of_pizza when a user named *HigherLogic* offered $100 towards Thanksgiving dinner for a family. People aren’t allowed to ask for themselves. The gifts purchased for requests go to children, games, video games, movies, posters, and clothing. We do *not* allow requests for gift cards or cash. I, for one

&gt;If I were to shirk my moderator duties in the subreddits I moderate nothing really bad would happen. In your subreddit

&gt;&gt;**pookie85**: I usually work pretty well under pressure, general concerns about getting responses, or wanting to know why the *Grinch has stolen their post.*

&gt;&gt;As a baby sub-reddit, as well as kindly directing them to our sidebar.

&gt;&gt;With the recent worry of scammers on the rise, not hurting someone’s feelings and publically humiliating them. As most know, this mistake has already been made once and we’re working hard to ensure that *never* happens again.

&gt;Will /r/randomactsofchristmas still be relevant come December 26? Or will it ""hibernate"" until next Thanksgiving?

&gt;&gt;**pookie85**: Just as Santa takes most of the year off only to prep for another busy year that will follow, we will sign off as an active sub-reddit until around Halloween. Though if anyone needs to contact us at any time, they are still free to do so.

&gt;I'm not even a Harry Potter fan but I personally found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/n0sbx/thank_you_khrysthomas_for_the_letter_from/) so cute and heart-warming that a little bit of my cynicism died upon reading it. What are some of your favorite posts so far from your young subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**pookie85**L My favorite posts are *always* the thank you posts that parents will put when they’ve received gifts for their little ones. You can feel the emotions coming from them. The weight that has been lifted from their shoulders once they realize their children *will* have a gift to open on Christmas. I have been in that position before. As a child

&gt;&gt;Though a few of my most favorite posts have included these as well:

&gt;&gt;* [A salute to the reddit givers. One man’s words.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/n1abx/reddit_givers_i_salute_you_please_take_a_moment/) 

&gt;&gt;* [A thank you post for some homeless children who received presents in time for Christmas.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/na6s9/a_very_huge_thank_you_and_group_hug/) 

&gt;&gt;* [An adorable toddler sized Star Wars fan with the best pictures I’ve ever seen.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/n969y/thanks_to_porkbuttextravaganza_for_chewie/) 

&gt;&gt;* [A thank you from Kyle’s mother.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/n5f8i/thank_you_to_everyone_who_sent_gifts_to_kyle_for/) 

&gt;&gt;* [This inspirational post made about the concept of RAoC.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/nb2vl/thank_you_all_of_you_and_raoc_as_a_concept/)

&gt;&gt;As I’ve said

&gt;Finally

&gt;&gt;**pookie85**: I think JetBoyTerp had the response you wanted here. It all depends on whether the tacos are soft-shell or hard-shell.

&gt;&gt;Ultimately

***

Merry Christmas to you, I take the fifth.

Thanks again for the interview! Thanks also to the other moderators of /r/RandomActsOfChristmas: jenners, jetboyterp, and espressopunk for creating and maintaining such a cool subreddit. Until next time, keep the change you filthy animals.",,False,self,False,t3_nc2ii

""Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself."" ~ William Faulkner

Some subreddits just do things correctly.  Today we feature a subreddit with the focus of a [bearshark](http://i42.tinypic.com/2hqqqkg.jpg)

Here's why we're featuring /r/weightroom:

1.  These people do more with less.  They have a very strict set of guidelines as to what posts will be allowed.  They restrict things like rage comics and self-congratulatory ""look what I did"" posts.  What they're left with is good

2.  The community members are fantastic.  The posts are good (and numerous)

3.  There's a lot of information here.  In a world where you'd think, there's a lot to think about!  These people will help you do it right and then give it a silly name, show you a video of it.  They'll even watch videos of you picking shit up and put it back down again!   They'll watch those videos and then tell you how you can improve your picking shit up and putting it back down techniques.  *Seriously, come over to my house and teach my kids how to pick shit up... I'll videotape it and critique your performance all day long!*

4. A commitment to excellence like no other.  This subreddit will hit 20, they have direction, all the things your parents tried to impart upon you.

Please join me in 3 sets of 5 reps, stronger you're making a difference in the world and reddit.com a better place.

Today we're featuring redditgifts.com.  It's not technically a subreddit

Just candy exchange??  But what about my Daft Punk costume I've been working on for 18 months

We're humbled to have the great *5days* here to present her incredible plan to us all.  


&gt;Hey 5days

&gt;&gt;[r/secretsanta](/r/secretsanta) is our subreddit and where redditgifts started on '09. We use redditgifts

&gt;Okay

&gt;&gt;We were on a family vacation in Utah for Thanksgiving. Kickme444
Neither of us expected it to be so big.

&gt;Your first ever Hallowe'en trick or treat

&gt;&gt;I'm really excited about this. We hope to see meetups all around the world. I can't wait to see all the costumes. redditors are a pretty creative bunch

&gt;[All Trick or Treat 2011 info can be found here](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/reddit-trick-or-treat-2011/). Can people go somewhere to post additional questions? 

&gt;&gt;r/secretsanta is a great resource. There are always people there ready to answer questions and I'm there pretty much every day.

&gt;Tell us all a bit about yourself - what's your story?

&gt;&gt;I'm usually an artist. I've had a dry spell over the last year but that's okay. I don't make a living off of it so I don't mind. We have two kids

&gt;Redditgifts is most likely a hobby

&gt;&gt;It did start out as a hobby. That's all we expected, crafts, snacks) and now Halloween. I was a stay at home mom for almost 10 years but this last summer we were acquired by Conde Nast to be a part of reddit so we get to do this as full time work now. It's pretty exciting!

&gt;What exciting things can we expect from redditgifts in the near or 
distant future?

&gt;&gt;Our next exchange after reddit Trick or Treat will be a coffee mug and tea cup exchange. The coffee and tea folks have been waiting patiently for quite a while. Our next big exchange and meetup will be Secret Santa '11. January is generally still busy with Secret santa for me so I think whatever comes next will be in February. We vare working hard to make Secret Santa the best one yet.

&gt;&gt;We are continuing to try to improve our meetup feature [http://redditgifts.com/meetups](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/) to make it more usable for all of the subreddits. It's been pretty well received

&gt;&gt;This first month of full time work has been a combination of planning Halloween and researching/implementing new features. We are both so happy to have the time to devote to redditgifts now.

Thanks 5days!  We'll be sure to check you out at [/r/secretsanta](/r/secretsanta) and at [redditgifts.com](http://redditgifts.com).  Be well!",self,t5_2sgno,True,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/ksi25/september_27_2011_reddit_trick_or_treat_2011_who/

They're tiny. They're colorful. They're delicious

What is it about cupcakes that has captured the cultural/culinary eye in the past few years?

For one thing

Oh, pally!

[Look at that. There are even lobster cupcakes. ](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lobster+cupcake&amp;bav=on.2

For another thing, and the flamboyance of cakes. (The only treat left out of the mix is ice cream, and I am assured that scientists are working that out, along with the no-tears onion.)

Also

I don't know. I'm not a scholar, and a cornucopia of cupcake recipes to boot, all guaranteed to deliver as many cc's of C.C's as needed. 

____

&gt;In your opinion

&gt;&gt;starrynightgirl: We use cakes to celebrate special occasions in our lives: birthdays, you can take a cupcake with you, to the office, on the subway, and eat it whenever and wherever you want. The most amazing thing about cupcakes is that now people see cupcakes as a form of culinary arts! (How well can you paint a image with frosting on such a small canvas?)

&gt;I imagine you do a bit of experimenting with flavors? What's the most surprising food that goes well with cupcakes?

&gt;&gt;.sng: When people think of cupcakes

&gt;What is your favorite cupcake recipe? What would you recommend to beginners?

&gt;&gt;sng: My favorite cupcake recipe is pistachio filling with white frosting and almond slices on top. I recommend to all beginners to start out with a Non-stick Cupcake/Muffin Pan, but a good cupcake is the cupcake you enjoy to eat. There are many wonderful recipes out there.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/cupcakes?

&gt;&gt;sng: and that's what /r/cupcakes is all about! We not only post pictures of amazing cupcakes, no worries, we are all here to share, upvote, and enjoy!

&gt;Please tell us what we'll find at /r/ZenHabits.

&gt;&gt;Honestly, quotes, etc. We cover a lot more than just ""Zen Habits"" - most of us don't have dreams of meditating in some cave in Tibet for the rest of our lives nor are we trying to isolate ourselves from the ""material world"" - we're mostly average folk, just looking to find a little more satisfaction in our work, relationships, fitness, and overall well-being.

&gt;Who is your target audience? What do people get out of /r/ZenHabits?

&gt;&gt;Cheesy as it may sound

&gt;&gt;I've seen people on r/zenhabits that are 16 years old and trying to perform better in high school

&gt;&gt;Everyone has different values and goals

&gt;&gt;In fact, you'll grow tremendously. For that reason, I don't really see r/ZenHabits as appealing to a specific demographic.

&gt;This appears to be a subreddit where people support each other. Do you get many (any) opposing views? Care to share any hot topics?  Hot Pockets?

&gt;&gt;There's definitely disagreements. Everyone has their own values, and everyone has a different idea on how to get there. Most of the time, no one is wrong, it's just a difference in perspective. I personally encourage it, and I even have a tendency to play devil's advocate myself. It gets people thinking about different possibilities.

&gt;&gt;This question actually reminds me of one of my favorite quotes:

&gt;&gt;""The test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time

&gt;What is your favourite type of post on /r/ZenHabits?

&gt;&gt;I like success stories. Most people don't make new topics about them, but with this technique I was able to improve myself dramatically"" - it feels good. It's living proof that these tools and techniques aren't just mental masturbation, but they have a real-world effect on how people live.

&gt;Your turn. Any thoughts you'd like to leave us with?

&gt;&gt;One of the things I most love about r/ZenHabits is that we are open to people sharing their own blogs and content. We have a handful of dedicated subscribers who run their own sites (sometimes

&gt;&gt;So what I would really like to encourage is: **If you have your own site on psychology, please feel free to share your stuff with us.** Of course, even if you don't have your own site, please feel free to participate and share other links. There are a TON of different resources out there right now and it's hard to keep track of all of them. Hopefully r/ZenHabits can continue to become a place to find a wide range of self-improvement information.

Jaxspider and I met online.  His photo had him wearing a softball t-shirt (barely exposing his beefy forearms)

Any given Walgreens.  Fair warning.

Like me, so don't try.  I have that effect on people (it's both a blessing and, nope.  *Just a blessing!*)  And /r/HumanPorn has it too.  Here you'll find incredibly incredible photos, all with people as the main subject.  It's one of the greatest subreddits out there, hands down (a term I'd like to know the origin of.  *""Who says that was the best pie ever?  Okay, hands down everybody.""* I'm still working out the details.)  Right.  /r/HumanPorn is, aaah you don't need me.  Get on over there and let the gob smacking begin.

Jaxspider, strictly 9-5:30, 1/2 hour unpaid lunch.  The staff spend most of their days in the cubicles trying to get mods to return our calls and sometimes we come up short.  So we post before we go to bed (yes we sleep together), and when we wake up, hopefully the mods we contacted have written us back.  THEN we post the interview.  I don't want to even think what would happen if they didn't write back at all - the shame spiral is, well it's bad.  Hopefully I'll have the interview posted when we all wake up.  Good night!

edit:  7:10 a.m.  I just woke up

edit 2:  7:12 a.m.  Just got word

Cliff Huxtable! We have our interview!  For those of you unfamiliar with our favourite arachnid

&gt;Please tell us the history of humanporn.

&gt;&gt;Syncretic had just started making more sister sub-reddits to EarthPorn, immediately went to the obvious, and that was a joke the first 5 minutes. But the more I thought about it, the more serious that suggestion became. I created it right after I suggested. And I've personally ~~man handled~~ over seen its quality control.

&gt;How closely are you associated with the [safeforwork porn network](http://redditdirectory.com/11839/SFWPorn-Network)? Where does /r/humanporn stand among the others? 

&gt;&gt;Syncretic created it. I done the original CSS layout. Presently I'm second in command. Half proud and half respectful of my responsibilities. r/HP stands equal footing with all the other sister subs. But if you are talking about subscriber based ranking we are [4th largest.](http://redditdirectory.com/11839/SFWPorn-Network) 

&gt;The submissions are incredible

&gt;&gt;Thank you

&gt;&gt;Only once has there been a request for removal of an image

&gt;&gt;Original content? Yes we get a lot of it. And its quite welcome. I also go around reddit like a hobo and [randomly](http://www.reddit.com/r/HumanPorn/comments/k9u2u/redditor_steelpenguin71_goes_cave_crawling_in/) ask [people](http://www.reddit.com/r/HumanPorn/comments/k47d6/quite_an_interesting_redditor_zombie_twatz_734x979/) if I could see what they look like if their [story is interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HumanPorn/comments/k3ebh/everyman4_daughters_heterochromia_1764x1616/)

&gt;You're reddit royalty. Please tell us 5 things about you and one thing that we'd be surprised to learn.

&gt;&gt;Royalty? When was I supposed to be notified or better yet crowned? :d

&gt;&gt;1. I mod over [60 reddits](http://redditdirectory.com/6354/jaxspider) I try to do the CSS layout for all of them.

&gt;&gt;2. I used to [draw custom aliens](/r/redditizeMe) for fellow redditors but there is no longer enough hours in the day...

&gt;&gt;3. I'm an artist at heart but a [cold hearted killer by trade?](http://image.x24d.com/uploads/1257478764.jpg ""Sorry I just love to troll."")

&gt;&gt;4. If you need help with CSS just ask me any time.

&gt;&gt;5. I have alot of hobbies. Too many for a healthy human being.

&gt;&gt;6. Unlike others who have a username for a little while

&gt;Any projects you're working on? Things we should see or watch out for?

&gt;&gt;Republic of Reddit. Thats all I can say for now about that. Secret society

&gt;Your time jax

&gt;&gt;Srotd. Yes you. [I love you man](http://www.thecriticalcondition.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/iloveyouman.jpg) in a totally bromance way. Seriously.

&gt;One final thought...

&gt;&gt;Look within yourself to clearly see outside yourself.

Thank you jax.  I'm not alone in saying this - you're one hell of a nice person &amp; the world's a better place with you in it!!

**605

Here at /r/subredditoftheday, and you ~~throw a hissy fit~~ provide valuable feedback that’s not at all psychotic.  That’s awesome.  It helps us improve.  But sometimes, it’s a little unfair.

I feel like the controversy that followed /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu being featured [last May](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/u0i1u/may_23_2012_rfffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu_all_i_want_to_do/) really took away from what an amazing mod team they have.  Plus, right?

So I decided to feature them again, you know, thank you.  You’re my muse.  This is like the first anything that I made – not counting [Helpful Freakazoid](http://i.imgur.com/sw7javY.png) and [Success Freakazette](http://i.imgur.com/3X1L8fl.png), but those are guys best saved for /r/adviceanimals.  Or, you know, whatever.  YOU’RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!

Since I’m 98.6% sure nobody read the interview the first time, suck it.  Also, it was really well done.  Jax did a good job with this interview.  It even has 60% more questions than my interviews usually do.  I did actual math on that percentage.  Anyway, the interview:

&gt;#1. How did you find ""rage comics"". and or how did you become a mod in r/f7u12?

&gt;&gt;**Rswany** I don't really remember specifically how but I was active on different internet communities that got some of their content from 4chan. (UGOPlayer represent! Right GuitarFreak027? haha) I was voted in by the community to be a moderator some time ago.

&gt;&gt;**squatly** Became a mod by asking BritishEnglishPolice (you should all [PM him](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/message/compose?to=BritishEnglishPolice) - he loves getting PMs where people ask him to make them mods). He then interviewed me

&gt;#2. How busy is it most days and in contrast

&gt;&gt;**DoxBox** It's pretty well always busy here. The only difference is if there's some stupid dramatic thing happening, then we have to deal with dozens of mod mails and ""I'm pissed off and making this my soapbox"" comics that need removal. There are other situations, but it all generally leads to more modmail and/or more crap submissions that need removal.

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** It's really, I've found myself beginning to just ignore it completely, which is troublesome for me and I'm trying to actively avoid.

&gt;#3. Has being a mod ever caused you to make a rage comic? Link to it. If not what internal conflicts occurred that the vast userbase have no idea about?

&gt;&gt;**FailCake** [This.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/j7t27/a_word_about_the_spam_filter) It failed miserably.

&gt;&gt;**Rswany** I dunno

&gt;&gt;**Livyka** Yeah

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** I've made ragecomics about modding before, we get some pretty hilarious modmail sometimes. Let's just say that some users take their rage comics very seriously.

&gt;&gt;**Mythrayn** Yes. [Here.](http://i.imgur.com/V5K4C.png)  Also [here.](http://i.imgur.com/exkwv.png)

&gt;#4. Has modding a ""Big subreddit"" affected you in anyway? Internally on reddit or externally? How?

&gt;&gt;**DoxBox** Only insofar as I make sure to check here much more often than I did as a regular user. Probably a dozen or so times a day, and to check mod-mail. Takes like 2-3 minutes to deal with your average amount of mod-mail buildup, generally 1-3 posts which are either ""This comic violates the rules."" (and a link to a post which is then checked and removed if necessary) or ""My post got deleted, you guys are terrible, let upvotes decide!"" (To which our response is: Read the rules, there's a very good explanation as to why upvotes are NOT a measure of something belonging in a subreddit.)

&gt;&gt;Sometimes users message us for other reasons; rules suggestions/clarifications, fuck the haters."" type, which always puts a smile on my face.

&gt;&gt;Aside from what I actually do here

&gt;&gt;**RestoreFear** Not at all. Actually

&gt;&gt;**Travis-Touchdown** Seriously, sometimes, but otherwise, it isn't so different.

&gt;#5. Repost a bane to society or a sign that good jokes never die? How has your present no repost policy effected the mod team? What methods do you use to know if a post is a repost or not?

&gt;&gt;**Travis-Touchdown** It depends on the subreddit. I think in smaller communities, and as far as I know there hasn't been any dissent about its presence, which is rare, considering our mod team is pretty large. Generally when we find something is a repost it's with one of two methods. We remember seeing it, ourselves, and find the oriignal, or more prominently the users tell us. Nobody sniffs out a repost like some of the f7u12 userbase

&gt;&gt;**squatly** Bane to society - it gets boring seeing the same thing over and over. I'm pretty sure the mod team all agree on this one. We generally check the comments to see if anyone has complained

&gt;&gt;**RestoreFear** Reposts are not good at all. We want users to share their own content

&gt;#6. Whats your favorite rage face? What makes it so special for you? Whats the one you hate so much? Why do you hate it? 7. What rage face makes no sense or you have no emotional connection with? Why.

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** My favorite face is the happy forever alone guy with his arms waving in excitement. It's what I do every time I submit something to reddit and it becomes moderately successful. I hate the derp face that everyone and their retarded dog use to make shitty comics about something stupid someone supposedly said to them. Someone in a high school classroom asked a silly question? A christian believes something goofy in the bible? NO SHIT SHERLOCK

&gt;&gt;**DoxBox** I have a new favourite rage face all the time. I think my answer to both questions is going to be the same: Me Gusta. I love that face to death

&gt;&gt;**Rswany** Cereal Guy(the old school one) will always be my favorite

&gt;&gt;**Mythrayn** My favorite rage face is definitely the happy one. I really have no idea

&gt;&gt;**squatly** Favourite face would have to be Me Gusta - it encapsulates the creepy pervert in everyone perfectly! I hate the angry man on the black background, and unfunny 99% of the time.

&gt;#7. If you could mod any one subreddit (not r/f7u12) which would it be? How would you change it from what it is now?

&gt;&gt;**Livyka** I would like to mod /r/askreddit. I wouldn't really change anything

&gt;&gt;**RestoreFear** I would mod /r/reddit.com and reopen it.

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** I'd like to be a mod on /r/IAmA as I think getting to verify posts with celebrities would be fun. If I had to change it I'd try to end all of the silly drama surrounding Karmanaut. People take the internet too seriously sometimes.

&gt;&gt;**FailCake** I would mod /r/WTF, because I'd probably go overboard.

&gt;#8. Open mic

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** No, sometimes millions of people in the communities we moderate. We have no idea who you are and we do not care about your life. Moderating on reddit is a shit ton of work that we do on a volunteer basis. I don't demand that you love us or thank us, but if you strike up an attitude because you disagree with a decision one of us made, expect all of us to ignore you in a hurry. There is no reason for us to put up with harassment and abuse from you, no matter how upset you are, so we won't. If you're getting that mad about something on the internet, you should probably go outside.

&gt;&gt;**FailCake** The mods really like it when they get private messages asking questions about the subreddit, Synth3t1c, etc.). They're really nice, give it a shot!

&gt;&gt;**squatly** I have some advice for redditors in general. A lot of people get caught up in the most mundane drama here - just remember you are on a website, and if you are in an argument, you were probably in the wrong).

And there it is.  Maybe now you can appreciate /r/f7u12 just a little bit more now.  Special thanks to jaxspider for being awesome enough to feature it the first time around.

I carry a list in my pocket of the most important milestones in my life

Here's the list of my most important memories:

1.  The birth of my daughter.

2.  Chick-fil-a.

3.  The birth of my son.

4.  ""Fields of Gold""

5.  The night I was conceived.

Yes, but my actions and expressions are totally emphatic so people tend to think I'm super important!!!!! *(4 exclamation points!)*  And also like Jennifer Garner's greatly underrated character, I too have only recently become aware that everything up until now has been A LIE!  Everything I hold dear, all those important memories - backburnered.  Put on the B-List, told to wait in the vehicle.  Because tonight, I have found /r/Pareidolia, a subreddit so good it could only be created by the Devil himself and moderated by the New Jersey Devils.  

As copied from Wikipedia, and hearing hidden messages on records played in reverse.

As copied from /r/Pareidolia, is that!  I don't care who you are, how old you are or what your station in life is... when you see a face in something that shouldn't have a face, there is nothing more important than seeing that goddamn face that doesn't belong there!  All worries subside, everything becomes irrelevant, everything's gone except that cute face that doesn't belong there.  Every emergency ward, holding cell, clandestine faces to take your mind off your situation.  Lost a digit?  Check out this happy toaster!  Ooh, but doesn't that Corolla look happy to see us?

Please help me spread the word about /r/Pareidolia.  With your help we can put an end to conflict around the world and prevent future catastrophes.  With your support, or a hated one, I don't care.  Just make it happen!

For those of you who come here for the confusing and annoying titles, these guys have much more important things on their minds than answering lame questions.  ""How'd you get started?""  Really, not earth shattering shit there.  Look, I'll do the interview...

How'd you get started?  *We started this when I saw Quentin Tarantino's likeness in a bowl of corn chowder*.

What do you like about being a mod?  *All the photos of cars &amp; vegetables.  Never gets old.*

Tell us about your community?  *Mostly psych ward patients.  Most are medicated or should be medicated.*

Is there anyone you'd like to thank?  *The creators of the CMA's.  My God they're brilliant!*

There's no denying that reddit has experienced some growing pain in the past. Downtime, others strive towards delineated areas for types of posts. 

/r/RepublicOfReddit is an experiment involving the latter group. What if the default subreddits had concise rulesets and careful moderation from their inception? Although it's still getting off the ground, loyal readers, take the time to at least take a look around. Have a great Sunday, everyone!

&gt;Please tell us a bit about yourselves.

&gt;&gt;Don't ask me what they have been up to down there for the last 3 weeks. I don't want to know. But man

&gt;What is the concept behind RoR?

&gt;&gt;dr666:That Lobsters are evil and must be cooked.

&gt;&gt;Oh, that we can with a smaller but committed user base increase the quality of the content in our Republic-Reddits.

&gt;&gt;This smaller

&gt;&gt;bs9000: I see it mostly as an open-ended experiment. There are two basic questions that drove it. They were asked mostly in response to a lot of the complaints and drama that we see around Reddit. One is

&gt;&gt;To test those two questions

&gt;What has been the most difficult part of establishing the Republic?

&gt;&gt;dr666: Time. A lot of us involved her are also committed to other projects on Reddit. So

&gt;&gt;bs9000: For me

&gt;Subreddits with similar concepts have been attempted in the past. What do you think sets this network apart from those other subreddits?

&gt;&gt;dr666: That is a good question. And I wish I had a good answer. The only one that stands out right now is that we seem to have a collective team involved that seems to run the gambit of several different parts of Reddit. And that broader base may help us survive in the long run.

&gt;&gt;bs9000: I'm not sure anyone on reddit really *has* tried anything quite like this before. On the surface it certainly looks that way, there are some big differences. Yes, we're both hoping to get better content, our approaches are vastly different. In fact, early on there was talk of having the Republic subs and the True subs merge, but we quickly realized that the concepts didn't mesh.

&gt;&gt;I think a really big difference is that, we're really, really invested in giving the users power of the direction of the subs in the Republic. That may not be obvious on a cursory glance. People look at us and they see, ""You can't post this, we'll remove that."" What they don't see is how much effort we've put into making it so that individual moderators can't dominate Republic subs by sheer force of will, or that users have some recourse when they feel that things are being handled unfairly.

&gt;&gt;Potentially

&gt;&gt;We've set things up to work more democratically. Ironically

&gt;What changes are in the mix for RepublicOfReddit?

&gt;&gt;dr666: Other than the mandatory Lobster cooking contest?

&gt;&gt;bs9000: One of the complaints we've seen most frequently is that the rules are too inaccessible, but the new version of our own ""republiquette"" is a big improvement nonetheless.

&gt;&gt;The other thing is that we've recently recognized a pretty big flaw in our system for voting on rule changes

&gt;What would you like to say to the subscribers of RoR?

Hello, seeks to not only tear down the sacred cows of culture, but to photoshop them into torrid, zoophilistic orgies. If you are fascinated by what people can create for the pleasure of themselves or others, or just want to see the cast of your favorite TV series coalescing in a sauna, please drop in /r/Rule34.

The ever-stoic moderator, despite being terribly ill. Please thank him for his contribution with either:

1. well wishes for a speedy recovery

2. posting some new porn to /r/Rule34!

&gt;What first started your interest in rule 34?

&gt;&gt;I actually first uncovered r/rule34 back when I was a lurker. The idea of the subreddit had a lot of potential to me, I started using the r/rule34 to post any miscellaneous pictures I had uncovered along the way. Very slowly, people started finding out about it and subscribing, and at the behest of others I decided to take over its moderator duties to help guide its growth.

&gt;Are there any unwritten subrules to rule 34?

&gt;&gt;There was for a very brief time an unspoken internet rule that Carl Sagan was rule 34 exempt. This was during his sudden resurgence in internet popularity, although I think his story serves as a valuable lesson that nothing is free from the rule.

&gt;Do you use any tools other than google to find your images?

&gt;&gt;There are several rule 34 image databases that have been built and maintained by other individuals much more hardworking than myself. They are still mostly limited to drawings and hentai

&gt;What have been some of the most difficult subjects to find so far?

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure about most difficult

&gt;What things have you learned with your work with rule 34?

&gt;&gt;I've long since spoken out on the idea of sexual equality as well as learning to understand and accept one's own sexual identity. Still, our message provides a valuable starting point for those who have long been battling their demons alone.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers?

When I first heard of the concept of lucid dreaming, too.) /r/LucidDreaming is chock full
of useful links, and why I nominated it to be SROTD. The moderator, OsakaWilson graciously donated some time to talk with us!

&gt;How did /r/luciddreaming come to be?

&gt;&gt;I'm a long-time lucid dreamer and noticed that when lucid dreaming would come up, so I created the subreddit and put a blurb on that AMA. That kick-started it rather quickly. Later, we got a big jump in subscribers after the movie Inception came out. (I still haven't seen it myself.)

&gt;Could you explain some of the different methods of lucid dreaming?

&gt;&gt;It is a quite elaborate process that takes a lot of work to master, you will eventually do the check while within your dream and when you do, with luck, you find that you are in fact dreaming. The second approach is to practice remaining in a conscious state while your body drifts of to sleep. With practice and understanding of the process, you can observe yourself going from being awake, through sleep paralysis, then watch the dream emerge around you. There are lots of pitfalls and ways to get around them—all that is what we deal with in the lucid dreaming subreddit.

&gt;What tips do you have for beginners learning how to lucid dream?

&gt;&gt;The first thing for beginners to do is learn to remember dreams. This is usually as easy as leaving a notebook and pencil next to your bed with the intention of writing your dreams down. For some reason, but the standard reality check is reading something twice to see if it changes. Dream words and numbers tend to change each time you look at them. If you look at the clock and it says 8:00, then you look at it again and is says 3.14, you are probably dreaming. (Recently, it is popular to count your fingers.) These are the steps that everyone should take when they begin. We have explanations for more advanced techniques on the lucid dreaming subreddit and lots of helpful people.

&gt;What's your best experience with lucid dreaming?

&gt;&gt;My best experience lucid dreaming happens every single time I make the realization that I’m in a dream. We are so accustomed to being in this one shared reality, I was floating in the air meditating and it felt very good. I decided to vocally command the good physical feeling to increase, like I do with light levels. I just kept turning it up and up until it was overwhelming. At that point, it continued increasing on its own and turned into an ecstatic, loss-of-ego experience that defies description. It was way, way beyond dream sex. However, normally my lucid dreams are more mundane things like flying, testing the boundaries of my abilities

&gt;What are some misconceptions about lucid dreaming that you want to clear up?

&gt;&gt;The evidence suggests that lucid dreaming takes place within our individual brains. “OBEs” and “Astral Projection” are fully explained by lucid dreaming and there is no evidence of the paranormal despite how simple it would be to conduct an objective verified test. I’m very anal about keeping pseudo-science out of /r/LucidDreaming. Another misconception that pops up a lot is newbies expecting to be able to control everything in a dream. Control is possible

&gt;Do you have any messages for your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Are you are dreaming right now? Better check—you never know for sure until you do a reality check.

Today we celebrate the idea of the grass being greener on the other side of the world.  Or at least in another country other than the one you're currently in.  /IWantOut has been a sub I have read for quite some time because I myself want out.  I had a nice discussion with [ohstrangeone](http://www.reddit.com/user/ohstrangeone) and he was nice enough to give me his take on this amazing subreddit.


&gt;&gt;/r/IWantOut started when I read an account of a pregnant woman who was patted down (felt up) by the TSA and, her husband naturally got upset and yelled at them, and then they arrested him for causing a disturbance. The stress of the whole incident screwed up something with the pregnancy and his wife ended up having to get a c-section, and the husband believed this wouldn't have happened had they not been screwed over by the TSA. That just absolutely infuriated me. This was after having seen several similar accounts on reddit and repeatedly noticing people in the comments saying how they were seriously considering emigrating out of the U.S. I felt the same way and said to myself ""Self, there has got to be a super-active expat subreddit on here, I'll bet you there is, what with everyone wanting to do this and there being a subreddit for everything else under the sun...""


&gt;&gt;There wasn't. There was the old, there wasn't anything for people who wanted to expatriate and needed info and help on how to do it, where to go, etc.


&gt;&gt;That's when I made the decision to start /r/IWantOut and then promote it by linking to it every time I saw a comment to the effect of ""I want out of this fucking country"" in one of the many, murdering someone, the TSA molesting people, the government further taking away our liberties, further invading our privacy, copyright law and secret treaties, domains being seized by 'Homeland Security' (god that's a terrible name, I don't know what idiot thought that was a good choice for the name of that agency...)


&gt;&gt;I ended up linking to that damned subreddit like twice a day--every single one of those threads you go into where the submission was something like what I mentioned above you'd see a comment along the lines of ""I want to get the hell out of this country"" and it would be upvoted like crazy (meaning that not only the commenter but also a ton of other people felt the same way). It's gotten to the point now where a lot of the time someone else has already beat me to it!


&gt;&gt;What's funny is that, Australia, and even a few Canadians) who want to get out for political or other reasons (e.g. a Canadian who wants to emigrate not because they've got a problem with Canada, but just because they think they'd like Japan a lot better).


&gt;&gt;It's gotten to the point where there are several people who regularly post there who know more about expatriating than I do, so I just check in occasionally, deal with the spam/reported links (very, very few on both counts), and take note of anything interesting I see.


&gt;&gt;I actually also started [/r/LanguageLearning](http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/) for a similar reason: there wasn't already a language-learning subreddit (amazingly)


I can't thank ohstrangeone enough for his cooperation in helping describe this wonderful subreddit.  I have lurked for a long time and am happy to make it my subreddit of the day.  I too hope one day down the road to find myself on the greener grass of a country I am proud of being a part of.

Hey London Redditors

I know there's been a lot of discussion on reddit about what's happening, I've been reading as much of it as I could.  And as things are hopefully settling down, and the clean up begins, please know that our thoughts are with you.

*First of all I'd like to say that I think r/subredditoftheday is a great idea. I think the way reddit promotes subreddits right now is extremely lacking, more specific subreddits, they could both ""fine-tune"" their reddit front page to see only what interests them, and also help to make reddit more diverse by creating little pockets of unique culture.*

*I'm a 26 year old male, an experiment. I honestly did not think it would achieve the success that it has recently. I simply enjoyed seeing scenic landscapes in r/pics, but there wasn't a good way to search for them on reddit, and I hated the ads in wallpaper websites and the shadiness of most blogs.*

*At the same time, and be presented with page after page of pictures. This is why I made the location required info for the title. It wasn't hard to enforce, most users realized the significance right away. The resolution is required so you can search for wallpapers. Most people don't know it, but my original intention was to create a wallpaper subreddit centered around landscapes. Needless to say, we are now a subreddit centered around landscapes that happens to have a few wallpapers.*

*I've never really kept track of the number of submissions per day, with spikes of up to several thousand in a day if we are mentioned in a post that hits the reddit front page.*

*My favorite thing about EarthPorn is the community. I have worked hard to moderate the trolls, everyone is here to share a little eye candy, and the fact that there is no sensationalism in the titles. We don't deal with controversial content, who doesn't love nature? There's nothing to fight about. We're just a bunch of tree-hugging hippies, man!*

*Honestly as I said earlier in this interview, transformed into a thing with a life of it's own, a movement, almost a culture of sorts. The first week or so I was submitting most of the content myself. Now I don't have to, even though I do submit from time to time most of my time is spent moderating the content that others submit. It's truly humbling, and I enjoy all the time I spend here.
I have no idea what the future may hold for EarthPorn, my one wish is that the energy stays positive. I want EarthPorn to be one of the few places on reddit that trolls are not rewarded, that the top comment on the number one post is not some snarky attempt at humor, but an intelligent, informative commentary of the location.*

*I'd like to end this by making a statement: If you have a cool idea for a new subreddit, you might have 10,000 subscriptions the first week. Hell, just look at r/ShutUpandTakeMyMoney!*",,False,self,False,t3_h8nyu

Cakes are used for various occasions. [Marriages](http://www.barkers-bakery.co.uk/wp-content/blogs.dir/20/files/wedding-cakes/wedding-cakes-cardiff-1.jpg), [farewells](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uTMot8D-v_Q/TTui1PILnyI/AAAAAAAAGW8/e-wI-ZlUc3o/s1600/Blogger.jpg), [welcome parties](http://abundantcreations.com/cakes_dir/cakes_all/Military/slides/WELCOME%20HOME%20CAKE.JPG), [valentine's day](http://springscupcakes.com/images/BeMineCake_000.jpg) and any festival you can think of and soooo many more! and sometimes it just doesnt need any occasion! :D And of course for each of the times cakes come in different shapes and sizes. There are separate cakes for each one of them which make the things more interesting and awesomer! :D

So here i am with the moderator of /r/CAKEWIN and she is gonna join us for a short interview! :)

&gt;##1. What inspires/motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?
&gt;&gt;**faerielfire:** I enjoy creating a place where people can share images of cakes

&gt;##2. Which is your favourite cake ? Do you make cakes ?
&gt;&gt;**faerielfire:** Hmm its hard to say. I enjoy pie more these days but in terms of cake I'd have to say lemon poppy seed, vanilla, or carrot cake. I make these on a regular basis with various icing combinations.

&gt;##3. Which is the best cake you have ever tasted ?
&gt;&gt;**faerielfire:** Hmm another hard question! I think Linzer torte is my favorite

&gt;##4. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?

In no capacity, and within it's subsequent culture following. 

I have, roasting, and pouring to people who genuinely believe that there is a better tasting coffee out there. Much like wine tasting and wine culture, many barist-i seek out specific flavors in the coffee and espresso. For those of you who are curious, I do suggest reading a brief summary of the ""plant-to-cup"" process through which the coffee bean must travel before you can have the best part of waking up. 

Latte art, expertly steamed milk and lots of practice are required for the best latte art! Rosettas, hearts, tulips, the batman logo all can lovingly be sculpted into your foam as a stamp from the barista saying ""I have crafted this drink with much precision and technique, enjoy"". 

[/r/barista](/r/barista) is another niche little community that offers information, coffee shops, and general coffee culture and consumption. If you feel the need to subscribe, please do and if you feel the need to freak, do the jitter-bug.

On a side and completely unrelated note; i'd like to leave you with a few thoughts for the day:

1.) How much crazy sex/drinking do you think goes on in the olympics between competitors. Like you mean great looking and talented people from across the world come to London for two weeks and AREN'T Gonna try to meet other attractive

2.) Will power is a really strong force when it wants to be. Never underestimate your own or others will power. 

3.) $1 pint nights at my local dive bar can be a dangerous proposition. 

4.) SROTD rules? Haha

*It was half past 4 when Thomas rolled in to town. He still had a few hours of sunlight

*The bank was a large building situated on the corner of the main square beside the Ethan Brother's Livery and Stable. A large sign hung on the front of the door that read ""Bank of Dorchester

*Just as had tied up his horse as was getting ready to walk into the bank

*""You must be Mr. Riddley"", and I manage this here bank"".*

Sorry I had to cut the narrative short tonight guys, I mean nothing, sounds better to me than my sweet pillow topped mattress.

As a novice writer, beautiful tool called the internet. With it comes a wealth of resources, blogs and communities to help anyone who aspires to be a better writer, or just wants to browse the dabblings of others. 

***/r/Write is one such community that gives open

[/r/Write](/r/write) is a shining example of what reddit should be! Their side bar is stock full of websites, discussions and posts asking for critiques on homegrown writing projects that need a set of fresh, willing eyes.

So, this might be just the subreddit you have been looking for!

Hello, to some of reddit's [most altruistic members](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditoroftheday/comments/dx5xv/hmasing_redditor_of_the_day_october_27_2010/), to reddit's [scandalous lotharios](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditoroftheday/comments/bi2vg/violentacrez_redditor_of_the_day_march_25_2010/). A wide variety of topics come up in the lively discussions: Favorite childhood toys, alternate accounts, first memory, and of course, monkey knife fights. It doesn't matter who is Redditor of the Day, and something new to learn about someone you may not have known.

Despite the occasional roadbump, new questions, and new nominees.

If you'd like to take part, and make her day special. (And if you'd like to nominate a redditor you like, please modmail us.)

D: Oh god, anutensil, and Wordslinger1919! They all took some time to talk with us. 

&gt;Why did you choose to moderate this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Kerri:This is one of the more refreshing and light-hearted subreddits among the reddit community. Not only do you get to know random people, but really can crack down and make things happen. It is a difficult subreddit to mod, but we make it work.

&gt;&gt;anu: I knew that I wanted to be a part of this subreddit as soon as I became aware of it in February 2010. Wait, I was thrilled &amp; took it dead serious. Since I'd never really moderated before, I'll forever be grateful to avnerd for having the patience of Job with me. Well, she still shows great patience with me. (Knock on wood.)

&gt;&gt;WS1919: I didn't. I've always wanted to but I wouldn't dare ask. I was tapped by kerrianneta and after what I can only assume was much deliberation, I was given the go-ahead a little over a week ago. These are some of my favorite redditors and it's my absolute pleasure to work with them. Good people all around.

&gt;What is the most rewarding aspect of /r/ROTD? What is the most frustrating/exhausting?

&gt;&gt;Kerri: The most rewarding aspect of ROTD is letting a redditor “have their day”. Everyone wants to feel special and ROTD gives people the opportunity to do that. People get really excited and the satisfaction they get and the FUN we have in that place is unbeatable. 

&gt;&gt;anu: Being exposed to a diverse array of personalities through the interviews &amp; being a part of /rotd itself.

&gt;&gt;WS1919: Thus far, sending the questions, getting them back, formatting them...I like things like that. And then seeing the finished product. Taking it from start to finish is a fun thing.

&gt;What is the most frustrating/exhausting?

&gt;&gt;kerri: The most frustrating/exhausting part is that sometimes we outdo ourselves. As I said, lives, etc, sometimes things can slip your mind. However, this team is really great up helping you out when you’ve dropped the ball somewhere.

&gt;&gt;anu: Oh

&gt;&gt;In the early days of /rotd

&gt;&gt;WS1919: Adding that goddamn Crown. I consider myself a relatively intelligent human being but I feel like a child when I try to edit flair. 

&gt;Who has been the most interesting/surprising Redditor of the Day so far?

&gt;&gt;Kerri: Oh

&gt;&gt;anu: There have been so many great interviews

&gt;How has the subreddit changed over time? Is there anything about the subreddit you would like to change?

&gt;&gt;Kerri: The subreddit has changed over time in that it has definitely gotten much larger. There are more people and more people to remember details about and keep up with. However, sometimes they disappear, sometimes they just show up one day.  

Is there anything about the subreddit you would like to change?

&gt;&gt;kerri: Hmmm, it’s followers and it’s highlighted redditors.

&gt;&gt;anu: I'll leave that to the visionaries.

&gt;&gt;WS1919: I'm just the New Guy. 

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/RedditorOfTheDay?

&gt;&gt;Kerri: Thanks to all the loyal followers who’ve stuck there through and through. We’ve had ups and downs and to see such supportive subscribers really helps solidify the fact that this is an awesome community, they keep the interviews interesting and I’m about 99.9% we have on of the best group of subscribers on reddit.

Thanks for joining us, we're glad you're here!

&gt;Hi garyp714. This may be glaringly obvious

&gt;&gt;Well
It's only been two weeks and we've already worked out the work shopping rules

&gt;&gt;I think a subreddit that relies on the feeling of trust needed to expose your inner thoughts to a community has to have good

&gt;You get a lot of submissions which receive tons of feedback (mostly suggestions on how to improve). My question is

&gt;&gt;So far I have met a college professor and several published poets people but to tell you the truth

&gt;&gt;What makes someone a poet? Besides the easy answer of college credentials or an MFA from some fancy poetry school

&gt;&gt;I personally write my best poetry when depressed :)

&gt;I'm intimidated by poetry. My first reaction when I thought about /r/poetry was

&gt;&gt;Believe it or not it's been there all along. I wish I knew how it developed but you'd have to go over to someplace like r/TheoryofReddit for a better answer than I can give. Especially considering the last moderator was very hands off.

&gt;&gt;If I had to guess I would say that being in poetry programs you get a sense of giving feedback without destroying this person that has put their soul on the line in an open forum. And time after time I see this kindness from the regular users and being someone who lives in r/politics a lot
But trust me

&gt;What does the future hold for /r/poetry?

&gt;&gt;Fun stuff like adding user flair, understated CSS work. Nothing too over-the-top. We are r/poetry after all! Maybe we'll look to r/lounge for some ideas ;)

&gt;&gt;And the biggest feature will be a safe forum for users to get their poetry work shopped by people that care about the work and the group.

&gt;Now it's your turn. Anything you'd like to say, people to thank?

&gt;&gt;Thanks to the cool people that stepped up and have volunteered to moderate the forum with me. I am excited to see where the new energy and multiple sets of hands will take the subreddit. It should be a fun ride!

&gt;&gt;And thanks to SRotD for taking the time to help subreddits get exposure like this. It's a great service. Cheers!

Hi


Let’s get this write up on the road.


I like gardens and I like physics


I’d like to say that this subreddit has opened my eyes and taught me things I didn’t know before. I feel this is why I decided to feature it. It needs way more subscribers than it currently has

&gt;##1. What made you all want to start /r/Physicgarden?

&gt;&gt; **Haven**: Knowledge is power.  So many people get stuck in the downward spiral that the pharmaceutical industry can get you stuck in.  Take one pill for this symptom, snake oil salesmen, etc), but you hardly ever hear about the normal people that are healing themselves with plants that most would consider weeds.  Additionally, many people (myself included) are without medical insurance.  Being able to be your own doctor so to speak, is a great weight of your shoulders.   
I think the more that people are aware and able to take responsibility for their health in to their own hands, without all the hocus pocus.    

&gt;&gt; **mutantgazette**: I like to participate with this sub reddit because I am part monkey that is always eating stuff like plants and I wanted to know which ones might make me healthier

&gt;##2. What are some things you think people should know about this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **Haven**:  We don’t pretend to know it all.   There are a few with more knowledge than most

&gt;&gt; **mutantgazette**: Plants are cool and fun, but hopefully it could be of assistance in people finding greater learning portals about Nature's apothecary.

&gt;##3. If you could be one character of spongebob who would you be?

&gt;&gt; **Haven**:  Sandy for sure.  The only girl

&gt;&gt; **mutantgazette**: Sorry

&gt;##4. What’s the best thing you’ve ever bought or received from this subreddit?

&gt;&gt; **Haven**:  Connections with amazing people and so much information! 

&gt;&gt; **mutantgazette**: Constantly receiving new ways to infuse (not inject) plants that I know nothing about. 

&gt;##5. What is the best thing about amazon in your opinion?

&gt;&gt; **Haven**:  Well the Amazon is a huge source of medicinal &amp; other plants with use.  I think something like 40, and we all know that plant is just amazing. Unless you meant amazon.com.  I guess that’s ok too. 

&gt;&gt; **mutantgazette**: Great reviews about books that review the Amazon.  


&gt;##6. I like physics and I like to watch people garden. Can you explain how these two are related or if it’s just a clever name?

&gt;&gt; **Haven**:  Well first of all, and there are records of them going back to the mid-1300’s.  The word herbalism is so misunderstood and misused in modern society, I really wanted to convey that we aren’t a bunch of kooks.  I know that at least I take a more scientific approach to the whole matter.  I think Physic Garden conveys that.  

&gt;&gt; **mutantgazette**: Ha! I have been meaning to ask Haven what she meant with the title of this subredit

&gt;##7. Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Physicgarden?

&gt;&gt; **Haven**: Thank you. The fact that so many others have the same passion for plants as I do is really encouraging. I'm really glad others enjoy this community and I look forward to learning more from everyone over the years.

&gt;&gt; **mutantgazette**: Yes

Thank you /r/physics garden for such a great subreddit.

&gt;""Do the recent actions of the Reddit administrators show that Reddit is no longer safe from censorship?""

&gt;""History is repeating itself. Hello Nazi Germany. :-(""

&gt;""Poll: Arrow Up If You Think America is Already In Fascism or 'Soft Fascism' ""

&gt;""We are now officially living in a dictatorship""


If you've spent any amount of time reading political discussions on this site

But fear not, The Sultan of /r/TheoryOfReddit, Lord of DepthHub, has a solution. /r/StateOfTheUnion, one of his many quality subreddits, aims at looking at current events with a clear, concise eye. Stick around! It's nice. No all-caps titles, or apocalyptic declarations of martial law to be found. New sources

Although his schedule was booked up

&gt;What are your goals in /r/StateOfTheUnion?

&gt;&gt;Originally, but don't really lend themselves to discussion. A phrase like ""no big government"" ends up being a way to stop discussion. So I wanted to encourage people to dig a bit deeper, to say why they were against something like big government, and what it meant to take that position -- even if the reasons and explanations seem obvious. What you find sometimes is that stating the obvious opens up a discussion, and allows you to find constructive avenues that were closed off when you relied on the premise that everyone knows what's meant by these stock phrases.

&gt;&gt;Lately, as viewed through the lens of its political back-and-forth. It's a bit like what might happen if This American Life cut out all of the cultural material and only aired stories about politicians and the results of shifts in government. When I started SotU, /r/politics was in pretty rough shape, and there was no /r/RepublicOfPolitics, but now with most of those handling political topics within more manageable boundaries, I'm thinking it might be best to roll with that new focus.

&gt;What sorts of issues come up most often in your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;SotU doesn't really get the usual reddit drama. We don't have much in the way of trolls

&gt;&gt;The real problem, there weren't so many people interested in finding way to keep it elevated. So SotU ends up being almost too much old school Reddit in that it's mostly links, and very little discussion. Without more discussion, it's difficult to insist on some of the approaches that, early on, I wanted to try out as a means of encouraging constructive dialogue. At this point, I'm probably a bit too burned out from other moderating duties to really enact those approaches the way I intended to the 20 or so months ago when I created the sub.

&gt;What have you learned from StateOfTheUnion?

&gt;&gt;I hesitate to call it a lesson, most people really wouldn't want to see the fundamentals of political discourse change. Most people, it seems to me, enjoy the bitching and moaning, and regard it as a fundamental part of how they participate in the process. And if they don't enjoy it, they tend to stay away from political discourse altogether.

&gt;What would you like to see change in /r/SOTU?

&gt;&gt;I'm still providing a significant proportion of the submissions, but also in working out approaches to the topics that differ from business as usual.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/StateOfTheUnion?

&gt;&gt;Try to look at SotU as a laboratory where we can experiment with ways of talking about politics. The approaches that work, our sub is just a small niche in the much, much larger realm of political discourse, but it doesn't have to be just an escape.

&gt;&gt;Thanks.

So

- The sound of your heart pounding in your ears. The cold weight in your chest. The prickling sensation that presses up your spine. We've all felt the stab of terror while enjoying a horror novel or scary movie- we've all loved it. We're creatures of adrenaline

- Ugliness has always been an aspect of our culture, lounging on a couch. It's a refreshing change to see the uggos rule for once!

- I personally don't like it when movies get preachy. For example

But don't take my word for it! The spooky mods of /r/Horror

&gt;Which book/movie/etc first got you interested in the horror genre?

&gt;&gt;RipperM: That's actually a tough one to answer. I became obsessed with the darker side of life at such an early age. I remember in the early seventies, and the lead singer describing himself slowly bleeding to death. I used to listen to it over and over.

&gt;&gt;The first movie I remember seeing in a cinema was ""It's Alive"". I think I was 6 or 7. Of course now it seems cheesy and ridiculous

&gt;&gt;Dearon: What really got me started was when I was a teenager and tried to find the most horrible movies to watch with friends. The whole ""show how awesome we are"" thing which, to give a idea of the types of movies, are Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer and I Spit on Your Corpse, I Piss on Your Grave (unlike the other two this one is not very good at all). In watching this stuff I realized how much I like the genre and started to hunt down everything I could get my hands on. Leading to me having seen many many movies over the years.  


&gt;What do you think makes for really good horror?

&gt;&gt;RM: For me

&gt;&gt;RM:Also plenty of spraying blood

&gt;&gt;D: The main thing that makes horror good horror for me personally is the underlying theme of being ""confronted"" with things whom are not acceptable in the real world. Think of things like brutal murder or rape. Through this, haha).

&gt;Most under-rated horror movie/book in your opinion: GO.

&gt;&gt;RM: One of the first to come to mind is Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Of course it had absolutely zero to do with the Halloween franchise, it would have done much better. The whole premise is ridiculous, but it's a fun watch. A more recent one that deserves more attention would be “Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (2006)”. It’s about a psycho who allows a documentary crew to follow his life as he plans his killing spree. Very cool film.

&gt;&gt;D: I can never narrow it down to just one, my personal favorite zombie movie so far (has a interesting production history as well). [Red to Kill](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111037/) from 1994, this one had a large influence on how I feel toward rape in a emotional sense (as opposed to seeing it from a purely intellectual viewpoint). This too needs a (big) trigger warning. [Street Trash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094057/) from 1987, this one has some really amazing gore. And finally [Teenage Exorcist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111383/) from 1991, not the most refined horror movie ever but I had a ton of fun with it.

&gt;Is there anything you would like to change about your subreddit? If so

&gt;&gt;RM: More in depth discussions couldn’t hurt. But really

&gt;&gt;D:We recently launched a chatroom (##reddit-horror on Freenode) which could see some more activity

&gt;What is your least favorite scary movie cliche?

&gt;&gt;RM: People in horror movies alway seem to have the shittiest cell phone providers.

&gt;&gt;“I don’t have a signal!”

&gt;&gt;“Neither do I!”

&gt;&gt;[stab stab stab]

&gt;&gt;D:The whole ""hey

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Horror?

&gt;&gt;RM: You guys are the flesh and blood (and gristle

&gt;&gt;No

&gt;&gt;P.S. You don’t only have to message us when your post is in the spam filter. We also welcome your suggestions and ideas. So... Do that.

Happy Hallowe'en friends!  So amazing you could join us on this day, the house was frickin' tip top before [olkensey](http://www.reddit.com/r/vstheearthship/) showed up and started ""opening up the space"".  Who takes walls down with a shovel anyway?  

Those redditors on the porch giving out candy and doing people's nails?  That's just [Reddit Laqueristas](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/l4t9a/october_8_2011_rredditlaqueristas_taking_art_to/).  They showed up around noon and started mani pedi-ing like it was the end of days!  Apparently

There's [/r/guitar](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/juqrc/august_26_2011_rguitar_scuse_me_while_i_kiss_this/) and [/r/malefashionadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/kpus2/september_24_2011_rmalefashionadvice_suited_for/) in the living room.

/r/Halloween is one of the nicest subreddits I've had the pleasure of doing business with.  They paid our ""promotional fee"" without hesitation, moderator *Thlowe* hooked me up with a nice new social disease!  ""Ooh, what'd you bring me from your Carribean vacation?""  Nobody ever expects crabs.  Despite that misunderstanding, Thlowe has taken /r/Halloween and turned it into a festive subreddit.  This place is THE place for featuring all your October 31st stuff.  Everything!  Here to enlighten us with one arm tied firmly behind his back is Thlowe!

&gt;Thank you for joining us on your busiest day of the year.  Three years as a subreddit?  Please tell us how you got started and how life's been!

&gt;&gt;Well, no recent posts, and the admin and sole moderator who had been an inactive redditor for a couple of years. Very disappointing. So, I took matters into my own hands, and after becoming moderator I noticed that the spam filter went back for years...it may have been the most frightening thing I've ever seen. Anyway, I tidied the place up, and got a few more subscribers (who I assume, were getting into the Halloween spirit)

&gt;What can people expect to find at /r/halloween?

&gt;&gt;For the first few weeks after I took over, which resulted in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/l7e8w/post_a_picture_of_yourself_we_recommend_good/), which I believe had the most comments out of any other subreddit I moderate. Over the past week it's mostly been people showing off their costumes and Jack-o'-lanterns, which have been pretty impressive for the most part.

&gt;I'm showing my ass here

&gt;&gt;Don't they have Halloween in Europe? In any case

&gt;What's some of your best ""getting into the spirit"" stories you've seen or heard of?

&gt;&gt;My high school used to go hard in the decorations. Like, spider webs, zombie busts...like, it was really impressive. And then, assuming Halloween fell on a school day, they would play ambient noises over the speakers in the hallways, with a cackle or chains rattling every now and then. That ***never*** failed to get me in the spirit.

&gt;What are you doing for Hallowe'en?

&gt;&gt;I will be donning a classic vampire costume (storebought, I plan to watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

&gt;Please take a moment with the mic.

&gt;&gt;Well, who tells me he did some recruiting for the subreddit, aaaand to fblan001 for offering to pretty up our CSS. And also **HAIL ERIS**.

&gt;Bonus question

&gt;&gt;Me personally? Well, so...you know, stuff. But r/halloween? Well, I can speak from experience (see question 1), but I can say the activity will definitely die down in a few weeks. It's buckets of fun being a moderator for such a seasonal subreddit, but I would not want to have to deal with it year-round.

At the risk of losing all our subscribers, but first let me get out in front of the noise this will potentially generate.  You can call it David Lettermaning the situation (when you got scandal and simply get everything on the table before the critics pounce).  Personally, I'm more of an Eminem-8-Mile man myself.  That time, when he was in a rap battle, with that guy, and he put himself down, I do that shit on a daily basis.  I am such a role model.

*Deep inhale.* Okay

- /r/box is subreddit of the day because it is silly as shit.  It is a subreddit that balances out the more serious, mindless, meaningless entertainment.

- Value?  Perhaps.  For some who's mind works this way, less refined individuals), this subreddit serves a purpose!  I can't tell you what that purpose is, but people are submitting, people are subscribing, I'd even go as far as saying people are enjoying this.

- ""But there's better subreddits out there, and today is just a quick stop on our journey.  All I'm asking is for your patience, understanding and sweet acceptance.  

- ""I'm unsubscribing, there's a lot of subreddits fighting for your free time and if we can get any of that by bringing you something new AND hopefully put a smile on your face (or the absence of a frown, we'll take that), then we'll feel alright inside.

&gt;Okay PineappleExpress

&gt;&gt;r/box was created as a tribute to the most perfect box the Amazonbox™, to the decorations that adorned it, and the perfectly place Amazon Smile ™ on its posterior, to the barcode and logo on its side. The Amazonbox ™ is the crème de la crème of Modernism. There is nothing that as perfect as the Amazonbox™.

&gt;What impresses you most about a box?

&gt;&gt;Aside from the Amazonbox™ a box is the perfect tool, a castle, a robot, samurai armor and many more things. Nothing has a much functionally as an empty box.

&gt;Pick one thing in the world that you wish was naturally box shaped.

&gt;&gt;The earth should be like anAmazonbox™ because nothing would be more amusing than a picture of Neil Armstrong with earth on the background with Amazon.com™ writing on the side. Also because fuck Galileo Galilei.

&gt;What is your favorite box? Why?

&gt;&gt;Amazonbox™ (refer to question one)

&gt;Tell us about r/Box's community?

&gt;&gt;The aficionados of r/ box are obsesses but culturally aware of the importance of box to the world and Iraq.

&gt;Anything you liked to add?

&gt;&gt;r/BOX should not be experience with other treatments that cause erections. r/BOX does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases, and upset girlfriends/hands . Less commonly, box vision, floppiness, urge to buy Amazon™ products, or sensitivity to light may briefly occur.

&gt;Ah... okay... By any chance you wouldn't happen to work for Amazon in any way would you?

*""All the other kids with their pumped up kicks

Few people in this mixed up muddled up shook up world are as passionate about their ""thing"" as barefoot runners.  It's a pretty short list...  Jimmy Buffett fans, they can't hold a candle to the shoeless runner.  So against my better judgement, I locked myself in a chat room with *jsh*, moderator at today's subreddit of the day.  I went in all guns loaded, ready to shoot down anything he was ready to say - turns out Mr. jsh is an excellent person with two words for us... ""try it"".

If running is on your radar (or will be someday), check out their page's Right Hand Side as an example of how to correctly make a subreddit.  It's impressive.

Take it away Mr. jsh...

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt; I don't call myself a ""real"" runner, barefoot. but I did run a half marathon barefoot.  I played a little in HS, but that was a really low level game, and was maybe a couple times a month on Fridays at most
I really started getting into ultimate around 2006.  I started barefoot ultimate a couple of months after that.

&gt;I'm curious how you were first exposed to barefoot running.  Was it ""the book""?

&gt;&gt; I had excruciating pain when I ran, there was a guy there who went barefoot.  Also living in a Chinese household, we always take our shoes off indoors at least.  Anyways, I really got into it when I listened to ""Born to Run"" by Chris McDougall.

&gt; One could argue that running without cushioning under your feet could lead to greater chance of injuries.  Ankle, back, etc.  Please tell me your 1st hand experience.

&gt;&gt;Okay, calves, feet, etc.

&gt;I'll give you ankle injury reduction (you're probably building up some great muscles).  What about knees?

&gt;&gt;Yes

&gt;Final injury question

&gt;&gt;I can't say if that is more of an issue barefooting or not but some people have reported relief from PF by going barefoot.  An arch is a strong structure in architecture, it will get weaker. Some people have reported cures of flat feet, and others of high arches, by going barefoot.

&gt;Why are we all wearing 3/4"" of cushioning and not running bf?

&gt;&gt;My theory is that it is mainly because of social norms

&gt;Can anyone interested in running

&gt;&gt;I recommend running walking barefoot, you need to build slowly because it places completely different demands on your body.

&gt;What surfaces can you run on?  What can you not run on?

&gt;&gt;It's like if you were wearing mittens your entire life, concrete, are the main surfaces I have done without any big issues. I'm sure asphalt can get too hot to run on, but I haven't run into that problem yet.  What I do find myself more conscious of is what is on the ground, and what surface i'm running on.  If you wear shoes, concrete feels almost the exact same as asphalt, but to me part of the joy in life is actually feeling what you are running/walking/standing on with you feet.

&gt;Anything else?

&gt;&gt;Yeah, it's not hurting you, or anybody else, so I don't see why people discriminate against barefooters so much. My main wish is that people would be more open minded.

I was first introduced to this subreddit by a friend of mine, but I've been told it's one of the most popular corners of Reddit, which is not surprising. I mean, who doesn't like trees? I recently sat down with one of the moderators, PenguinKenny, to -- hold on a second, my editor is trying to tell me something. I can't -- my earpiece isn't working for some reason, folks. Let's just cut to the interview.

&gt;I'm so glad you could join us. Could you please tell us a little bit about yourself?

&gt;&gt;I'm PenguinKenny (aka Penguin, but had been interested in the legal issues for longer. I've been part of the /r/trees community from the very early stages, when it was just cinsere moderating. Then when it hit around 75,000 (maybe earlier), cinsere (who I had talked with quite a bit before) asked if I'd like to help moderate. It seemed like the perfect way to give back to the community I love so much, apart from the TreesRadio website.

&gt;The legal issues surrounding trees? Like forest preservation? Very cool

&gt;Anyway

&gt;&gt;/r/trees was originally set up after a fiasco over at /r/marijuana. The mods issued a new set of rules that most of the community didn't agree with. One moderator, which left b34nz, a bigoted racist. He then began a banning rampage, as he banned anyone who suggested leaving to start a new community or pointed out what he was doing. So, obviously, people got pretty annoyed, and a whole range of separate subreddits got created

&gt;Wait

&gt;What sets you apart from other subreddits?

&gt;&gt;Personally, and /r/cannabis which covers issued more related to legalization. Really, anything cannabis-related is allowed in /r/trees, as it is in the other ""weedits"". However, users find that some sub-reddits are more likely to respond better to different posts.

&gt;You sure do know a lot more about trees than I do. Guess that's why you're a moderator

&gt;Do you have a favorite submission thus far?

&gt;&gt;Some of the funniest stuff I've seen on Reddit has come from /r/trees, from leaf_in_the_wind. After browsing places like /r/politics, /r/atheism (both of which I love, by the way) etc., I do find /r/trees to be the place I can just hang out in.

&gt;This is sort of an off-topic question

&gt;Seriously? What does that have to do with dendrophilia

&gt;&gt;A distinct memory I have is when a friend and I decided to cut up some hotdogs, then sprinkle crispy fried bacon over that. It was absolutely delicious. The bacon was the best bit, easily.

&gt;That sounds amazing. For some reason I thought you would be a vegetarian.

&gt;Any crazy stories you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;Nothing yet

&gt;What would you like the future to hold for your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;I would like to see /r/trees grow, trying to push for an official non-profit organisation known as the ICCEF (International Cannabis Culture Education Forum), which hopes to enable a platform for which we can discuss and teach.

&gt;Well that's just terriffic. Deforestation is a serious problem that needs to be addressed soon!

&gt;Is there anything else you'd like to say to our audience?

&gt;&gt;Even if you're a non-smoker (of anything), or the medicinal value of cannabis then we, the moderators, would be happy to give you any information we can.

Hello loyal readers! Reddit is already a vast place, let alone actually meeting people. Rest assured, there are some cozy corners of reddit where good company is always found. (Some of these places have been featured here.) 

I've met some terrific people on this site- as evidenced by my steadily growing ""friends"" list. I've appreciated everything from a friendly conversation or story

Have you met an awesome redditor? Please come by to /r/ThankYou and tell your story! If you haven't

Avnerd, whose love for lobster is only outshone by his love for helping, and Wordslinger1919, my personal confidant, all took the time to answer our questions about /r/ThankYou. 

&gt;Please tell us a bit about yourselves.

&gt;&gt;Av: I’ve been on reddit for a while and have made some really great friends, deep, thoughtful, motivating and inspiring – I’m really fortunate to have them as friends.

&gt;&gt;Oh and I’m a grandma and I couldn’t be happier about it!

&gt;&gt;dr666: I've been on reddit for near five years now. I spend a little too much time here. I get involved in things that interest me. Avnerd invited me to be part of r/Thankyou and I like AV

&gt;&gt;Ws: I've been on reddit for about a year and half now and have had the pleasure of getting to interact here with a bunch of smart

&gt;Who/what should we be more grateful for?

&gt;&gt;Av: I can only speak for myself but I try to let my family and friends know how much I appreciate them and how much I love them. It’s sad to think about but there will come a time when they are no longer around and I want them all to know how special they are and how the world just wouldn’t be nearly as great without them. 
Also

&gt;&gt;I’d also like to say thank you to jedberg for letting us have r/thankyou. Thank you jedberg!

&gt;&gt;dr666: Probably my family. On Reddit

&gt;&gt;Ws: The people that we choose to surround ourselves with. I also believe that we should take more meaning in our everyday interactions with people whom we may not even know. I guess just human relationships in general.

&gt;What is the kindest thing you've ever done for someone?

&gt;&gt;Av: I don’t know. But I will say that sometimes the smallest things to us can mean more to people than we realize. If we take the opportunity to compliment people or take an interest in their endeavors it can make their day brighter or make a long road less lonely.

&gt;&gt;dr666: Well, it probably evens out..... though we hope we do more than good than bad. Do we?

&gt;&gt;Ws: Jeez

&gt;What is the kindest thing someone has done for you?

&gt;&gt;Av: I have a very dear friend who helped me out financially when I really didn’t have any other options (even in retrospect) and he did so without me asking. He also refused to let me pay him back

&gt;&gt;Ws: Well

&gt;Who has been the most influential person in your life?

&gt;&gt;Av: My mom. She grew up dirt poor and made a good life for herself. She never whined or complained – she just worked hard.

&gt;&gt;dr666: Probably my parents. I read a lot, as in all things, some of that is bad as well as good.

&gt;&gt;Ws: My father. But I think that sentiment is true for most men.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/ThankYou?

&gt;&gt;Av: That saying “Be kind to everyone

&gt;&gt;You can make a positive difference in someone's life and it can be as simple as a smile.

&gt;&gt;dr666: Thank you.

&gt;&gt;Ws: ""You've got to be *kind*

If you use reddit as much as I do, I'm still on probation for sending all those threatening letters to Kevin Rose. 

But Pravusmentis has come up with a bold solution. He has created a subreddit called /r/ProjectReddit. ProjectReddit specializes in exercising the atrophied parts of our brain that deal with accomplishment and social interaction. So get your ass off of that comfy computer chair! (Well, play a new game! Conquer whatever new challenge is proposed! And when the day is done, report your new experiences to the site that has burrowed its way into your soul.

Knowing Pravusmentis' only weakness

&gt;What first inspired you to create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Who knows where ideas come from

&gt;&gt;Well

&gt;&gt;I decided I wanted a reminder that there were things I wasn't doing and things I could be doing. I wondered if there was already a place that could remind me to do things. I asked reddit and they said there wasn't but they would like one too

&gt;What's the hardest thing someone can do?

&gt;&gt;I don't think humans can empirically answer that question at this time.

&gt;&gt;Although if I had to make some conjecture

&gt;&gt;So I might guess that: It would be something that is applicable to almost all, you may bring another life into this world and feel yourself completely justified. Once you have a reason for doing something atrocious then it doesn't seem so bad. Perhaps then doing something for no reason would be a greater challenge? Chopping off your own limb would be pretty hard. You have to feel the pain, you must also face the fact that you will not ever use that limb again, and still come to hurt yourself. Then again, that [hiker cut off his own arm with a dull knife to survive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Ralston), and a [fox may chew off its own leg to escape a trap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trapping#Foothold_traps); so perhaps even with reasoning things can be quite hard. But all these things have been done, perhaps there are things that are so difficult that no one has succeeded yet. Like [openly](http://images.wikia.com/simpsons/images/3/39/Hank_Scorpio.png) [conquering](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Ae0l5wTwb7s/Rnv1PZuUruI/AAAAAAAAAGI/y4jZWlQ86jA/s320/Mr%2BScorpion.bmp) [the world](http://deadhomersociety.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/youonlymovetwice5.png). (Of course, and if physical pain can be ignored then physical strength should be as well. Would it be an emotional pain? People suffer great burdens stoically and unbeknownst to others

&gt;What's the hardest thing you've ever done?

&gt;&gt;Again we get into the question of how to gauge what is hard to and to whom it is hard to. Thing I have done include: Extreme recklessness; climbing mountains; learn many things but yet so little; and been diving into the Pacific Ocean during nighttime in winer (~45°). I have cliff jumped into water which could have been a glacier the day before, and that I may have never done anything which was very hard at all.

&gt;How do you think up your challenges?

&gt;&gt;I just sort of decide on the challenges

&gt;What do you hope to accomplish with ProjectReddit?

&gt;&gt;I've never been very good with goals

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/ProjectReddit?

&gt;&gt;yes:

&gt;&gt;Blah blah blah:

&gt;&gt;Years ago something happened to me that changed my life. It was like I had viewed the world for the first time, corporation, and people with too much money were 'designed' carefully to illicit certain responses to their appearances. That laws and policies existed and were being lauded, that kept the poor poor and the rich rich. Not so long after this I discovered reddit, and it seemed like I could finally talk to people who had similar opinions or have rational discourse with those who had differing opinions. I greatly enjoyed learning about new technologies (although I continued to see great potential for misuse) and scientific breakthroughs; and is part of the reason I chose to pursue science for formal training. Although one could argue that with the influx of people, that reddit's basal intelligence levels have gone down, amount of celebrity talk and pictures has skyrocketed, and technology posts are getting fewer and fewer upvotes. Yet it continues to be a radical approach sharing information. One editor with stuffed pockets isn't deciding all that you see

&gt;&gt;To project-reddit's awesome readers:

&gt;&gt;I can only give you the challenge, only that you did.

&gt;&gt;I want to encourage you to just go for it, statistically perhaps even of all time. We have the potential to change the world as you know it. You have the potential to change the world.

Dear friends, there's our humble site, but you gotta get in line behind [/r/guysinyogapants](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guysinyogapants/).  Oh, and let's not forget the doofuses at /r/shamelessplug!  But wait, there's more!

Today we're featuring /r/PimyMyReddit

1. You submit a self-post on /r/pimpmyreddit and thoroughly describe your subreddit.  Don't forget the sales pitch!  Tell everyone why you should be considered to be the recipient of free advertising.  Include a 300 x 250 graphic that will serve as your ad.

2. Go make some coffee.   Subscribers to /r/pimpmyreddit will read your submission and upvote you should they believe you deserve attention.

3.  Somehow the reddit mods and cupcake1713 get the message.  The get together in their palatial palace up on Mt. Olympus and from there it's just like the Westminster Kennel Club.  ""Bring me /r/GuysInYogaPants!!""

4.  The lucky few will get their subreddit advertised for free in the bottom right corner.  And that's where babies come from.

The great cupcake1713 will now fill us in!

&gt;Alright. Please explain /r/pimpmyreddit. How does it work?!

&gt;&gt;/r/pimpmyreddit was originally set up to provide free subreddit advertising. Now it also doubles as a place for users to request surveys to be made about whatever subreddit they want. If either a mod or a friendly user would like to have a subreddit promoted

&gt;So now elaborate on the free advertising. How do you have the juice to publish such advertisements on reddit.com? Can you provide us with some examples?

&gt;&gt;The free advertising serves the purpose of alerting the reddit community to little-known subreddits. We typically promote subreddits that do not have many subscribers or are particularly funny/interesting. It also gives some graphic designers the opportunity to showcase their skills (if a subreddit that requests to be pimped does not have an ad already made up

&gt;Big question... why. Why do you do this?

&gt;&gt;We do this because there are so many subreddits that most people do not know about. We want to introduce users to subreddits they might not typically frequent

&gt;I understand that some surveys are afoot. Please explain this! How'd you get involved with this project?

&gt;&gt;As we found out from the recent [site-wide survey](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/who-in-world-is-reddit-results-are-in.html), and by having subreddit-specific surveys we can do just that! Letting the various subreddit communities choose what questions they would like their peers to answer is pretty cool, too—some people have great questions that generate pretty neat results.

&gt;What do you enjoy most about /r/pimpmyreddit? What would you like to change?

&gt;&gt;I enjoy getting to learn about many different subreddits that I never knew existed. I’ve been on reddit for over three years now

&gt;Anything you'd like to say to the millions

This is a interesting sub-reddit, thats the Thunderdome. r/Mashups is where you go to get your music mixing on. Its a fantastic sub-reddit thats been around for a while but never got really big. I go deep undercover and have an indepth interview with r/Mashups's mod, bkbeezy the man behind the curtain. Some would say he is a mastermind others just consider him nice guy.

&gt; Since when have you liked listening to mashups?
&gt;&gt; I started listening to mashups back in 2008. I was looking for albums to fill up my new ipod, including making my own, and now I'm here today.

&gt; What are presently your top 5 mashups?
&gt;&gt; Hmm

&gt;&gt;1. [**Girl Talk - Down for the Count.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr2cfwR0roU) There are so many good bits in this
2. [**E-603 - Still Riding.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBaVws1xWzU) The beginning on this is also amazing. It just fits so well.
* [**Girl Talk - Here's the Thing.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpHXcBUQ2hk) Another amazing Girl Talk track. Every part of this is amazing. Jessie's Girl + Three Six Mafia is hilariously awesome.
* [**Danger Mouse - Encore.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbXLp2z6xL4) One of the best tracks off of Danger Mouse's classic Grey Album
* [**The White Panda - Shooting Superstars.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGskWuz7Rwg) Only Eminem is very well known

&gt;Who would like r/mashups
&gt;&gt; Mashups really appeal to many different people since there are so many different styles of mashups. There are mashups for people who like contemporary music, etc. Just about every genre has been sampled, and there's a good chance your favorite band has too.

&gt;Please tell us about your community members!
&gt;&gt; There are a surprising amount of mashup artists that lurk and post in r/mashups (barring myself). From the top of my head, Powerhawk, Bruneaux, DJ BC, and Hello Money have posted or commented here before.

After I was able to get my mind off of how delicious country fried bacon sounded I was able to talk to the mods over at /cfb.  They were very nice and very accessible and told me a lot about the sub.  This isn't a site that I had previously been subscribed to but after a quick look it seemed like something right up my alley.  With the college football season right around the corner I'm sure there are others who would be delighted to find such a fun subreddit.  After a brief conversation with [blueboybob](http://www.reddit.com/user/blueboybob) I understood what it meant for something to be for ""all the tostitos"".

&gt;&gt;We are about to begin only our second full season of college football as a subreddit. In one year we have gathered over 3300 like minded users who like talking about college football. 

&gt;&gt;Reddit is full of sports subreddits

&gt;&gt;Users can represent the schools they root for in comments and submissions. With that I was able to tell people in /r/sports and the subreddit begin to grow. I also decided that the subreddit image would change each week to the #1 team in the nation as the national polls released the rankings of teams. Then came along ClemsonPoker and he decided we should have our own poll. So we had people apply to be pollsters and each pollster made their own personal top 25 of best teams. Now our logo each week represents the top team in our internal poll. 

&gt;&gt;Toastercookie had been making weekly gameday threads for live action trash talking.  We have all kinds of graphics that users can use inside [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/j0cby/poll_results_and_new_features/) to help express how they feel during a game. Then we decided to take it one step farther and set up an IRC for users to talk in real time. Last season

&gt;&gt;Further

&gt;&gt;While trash talking other teams is not only allowed and encourage we do NOT allow name calling and disrespecting. The mods work hard to keep the site clear of spam and trolls. We all like to root for our own teams

The human species is mind-bogglingly complex in many ways

Other animal species tend to let evolution determine what abilities/characteristics they possess. For instance, develop water resistant feathers and/or other body features keen for diving. Cheetahs, who need to be able to run fast and strike hard to catch prey, have developed muscle structures and natural offenses to aid them in the hunt. This is known as the [Theory of Microevolution.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microevolution) 

Humans, though, is a brain. A brain that allows for curiosity and creativity; inquiry and experimentation. It seems as though we have removed ourselves from part of the microevolutionary process and opted to use our intellect to create technologies, instead.

Take for example medicine. Instead of waiting for our bodies to, we use our ability to examine, and critically assess illness, to create medicines and treatments, so we may cure and alleviate. Other animals just die. Another example would be farming. Instead of limiting our population to what the earth can provide for naturally, we innovate new and more efficient ways to produce food in mass quantities to feed ourselves. 

Cooking, but also to taste and to savor. Cooking is, in my opinion, one of the most distinct activities humans participate in. The closest thing to cooking that other animal do is maybe storing food, or making sure food is dead/clean before they eat it. 

Culinary art is so diverse

So, one can appreciate the food people post as being unique and intriguing, if only because it looks yummy. This community could inspire you to create new culinary experiences for yourself, or just make you hungry while the pizza rolls cook in the microwave.

Reddit has proven time and time again to be a diverse community. Wherever you go on this site, opinions, likes, locations, vices, dislikes, fears, and anachronisms. 

/r/WindowShots is a great example of this diversity. With each post, This peek is why I think WindowShots is so special. To see, for the moment in a camera flash, we see through *someone else's* eyes.

&gt;What first inspired you to mod /r/WindowShots?

&gt;&gt;I first became aware of the subreddit when someone suggested I x-post [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/f9i5v/itap_from_my_nyc_fire_escape_during_a_snow_storm/) submission of mine. I was instantly drawn to the fact that it was one of the few subreddits left that had a good amount of traffic, Raldi, and since I knew he had just taken a new job with google, I sent him a PM asking if he'd like a hand.

&gt;Are you ever jealous of a redditor's location? If so

&gt;&gt;Honestly, NYC is still where I feel at home. I like looking out at the city, no matter how nice some of the views elsewhere are. There was one post from, Dubai I think...that one I'll admit to some jealousy.

&gt;What is the strangest location you've seen so far?

There are many music communities on reddit. Several have been SROTDs

I may not be a music expert, but you'd be DEAD FUCKING WRONG. Cellos have a distinct personality than dime-a-dozen violins, but more portability than the amusingly-difficult-to-transport bass. Cellos have been included in everything from ""Atom Heart Mother"" to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"". As for /r/cello? It's the quiet underdog of reddit. It serves a small number of people, but sincerely and professionally. It's not just for fellow cellists to swap questions and advice- newbies and those just curious can stop by to learn more about the instrument.

To celebrate Cello Appreciation Day (which I may or may not have made up on the spot), and ccellofleming, the mod team of /r/cello, took a few questions from us.

Please tell us a bit about yourselves. How long have you been playing cello?

&gt;&gt;Liser: Hello, former who's a double major graduate from Juliard, and latter who's the principal of my city's orchestra (TSO - Toronto). I've also been teaching for about 7 years, but I had to let my students go because I moved out of town and have been traveling since.

&gt;&gt;legateau: Full disclosure: I haven't been playing as long as some of the other guys

&gt;&gt;ccellofleming: I have played cello for 14 years. I started in 5th grade and was lucky enough to have a fantastic supportive teacher who set me up with a mentor program early on. I studied with a cellist of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra for 5 years

What sorts of posts can be found in your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Liser: I'm not sure if it can be specified - it's a place for people who share the same passion, seek for help, advice on accessories, so on an so forth. I'd say, personally, it is the most positive subreddit I'm subscribed to.

&gt;&gt;legateau: It's a bit eclectic right now since we're relatively new but I think we're really picking up steam now. Anything and everything about cellos, playing tips or discussions about cello music. We don't discriminate!

&gt;&gt;ccellofleming: r/cello is a fantastic resource for cellists at any level. Everyone is honest, learn about other peoples approaches to playing specific pieces, and anything else cellists would want to discuss! 

Why should someone choose cello? Why not bass or violin?

&gt;&gt;Liser: It is a personal preference, the celli have the advantage of having both melodic and supportive lines - which does attract some.

&gt;&gt;legateau: It's ultimately up to the individual to decide, but cellos are just cooler. It's been scientifically proven.

&gt;&gt;ccellofleming: Obviously no one instrument is better than another, but whatever it is, it has kept me playing for most of my life.

Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/cello? 

&gt;&gt;Liser: We've steadily been growing, and it's delightful to share our common passion for the cello!

&gt;&gt;legateau: You guys are awesome! We've come a long way since we started up and it's only the beginning. Keep practicing intelligently and don't forget to post progress videos! I'm thankful for all of you that post and read - you make this place great. I'd give all of you guys a hug if I could.

It started out a few weeks ago

I told him about ""Salt and Pepper""

He told me about the sleep-over classics that never seemed to work, Stiff as a Board, so on and so forth. He brought up one other one that his friends used to play, but added that he always lacked the guts or the resources to follow through on his own. 


After describing all of this, mentioned that he thought he had the guts this time. His tone was of high spirits, but there was something stonier, and more serious underneath. 

I recounted an event when I was in grade school, but for the life of me I can't remember the whole story.

What I do know is *something* happened. I vividly remember the newspaper article, and a candle, that the trail for the police dogs ran anomalously cold. I also know that any mentions any of those games were treated strictly by the teaching staff after the alleged incident. Three girls in my grade were once suspended after getting caught playing Bloody Mary in the bathroom mirror, and many a kid were sent down to the office for even the possibility of planning a game.


He didn't reply

Riley PM'd me last night

I'm still sitting here, and these thoughts lose their comfort.

As a reminder: Don't play games when you don't understand the rules

_______

&gt;What is ""3 Kings""? How did it start?

&gt;&gt;RastaMom: r/threekings is a subreddit to share our experiences following any kind of paranormal recipe or ritual. We will not attempt to establish what is ""true"" or ""false""

&gt;&gt;FableForge: It's [a supernatural-themed game](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbo0u/please_dont_actually_try_this/) -although there are sound psychological explanations for why it works


&gt;Have you tried it

&gt;&gt;RM: FableForge has tried it

&gt;&gt;FF:A bunch of people have tried it; there are great stories in /r/nosleep, but it seems the majority of times people experience some sort of socratic dialog with entities which may or may not be of their own making. It must be said though: the subreddit welcomes all kinds of paranormal recipes and experiences, not just Three Kings.

&gt;What should people know about your sub before subscribing?

&gt;&gt;RM: I think the most important thing people should know before subscribing is that we are not here to debunk anything. Really far-out fantastical tales may or may not be removed by moderators, but please be respectful and don't try to debunk others.

&gt;&gt;FF: That we're not /r/occult. That we don't subscribe to any belief system, but we can't expect others to believe them too, and we enforce this in the subreddit. Without the scientific method we simply can't establish objective truth, so nobody has the right to scold anyone about doing anything ""wrong"". We just want to be respectful and supportive of everyone who shares with us their very personal experiences, and we want to make everyone feel welcome to share freely. 


&gt;ThreeKings has been open for about 3 weeks

&gt;&gt;RM: I think the concept is so interesting because it's mysterious, they can come here and share experiences and new recipes with fellow paranormal enthusiasts.

&gt;&gt;FF: We are wired to explore, at the center of what makes us human) we just don't accept the fact that some questions don't have answers yet. We'd rather make them up if we have to. Is there life after death? Are there spirits around us? We just have to find out. Perhaps nothing will answer these questions scientifically during our lifetimes, but these little games get us as close as some of us will get, and along the way we may learn a valuable thing or two about ourselves. There's a very human thrill to be had in exploring the unknown. 

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the faithful fans of /r/ThreeKings?

&gt;&gt;RM: To the fans of r/threekings- you guys are amazing! Subreddits require genuine

&gt;&gt;FF: Keep experimenting. Has anyone ever tried to apply internet crowdsourcing to paranormal investigation before? But be careful though. There are psychological and emotional risks to consider, be an explorer, be a pioneer, and learn all you can while you still can!",,False,self,False,t3_xp5i5

&gt;What do you think it takes to write a good one paragraph story?

&gt;&gt;A really strong sense of theme and a willingness to edit yourself merciless. I'm still working on the latter.

&gt;&gt;If anyone is thinking about giving it a shot, emotions or revelations you can find in that image. Once you've got written out, look it over and think about changes you can make to strengthen what you've got. Would this sentence work better at the beginning of the story? Can I do without this detail? That sort of thing.

&gt;&gt;But in the end, so I wouldn't want anyone torturing themselves over this. Just sit down and start writing, and when you're done, post it to the community. We're as much about honing your skills as we are about presenting a polished, finished work. There's almost no reason not to submit a story if it's something you want to do (unless it's too long to qualify as a single paragraph, in which

&gt;&gt;Gadianton:  If you feel like you have need please post with the [REQUEST] Tag.  If your need as been fulfilled it would be nice if you followed up with a [FULFILLED] tagged comment in your original post (or you can edit the post).

&gt;&gt;If you have a desire to help you can post with the [OFFER] tag.
Anyone who wants to fulfill a request can do so in any manner. You can go ahead and arrange a time and address and just order off of the national website or local place as you prefer.

&gt;&gt;I recommend that those details be worked out between the Requester and Fulfiller through PM to keep addresses confidential.
Some people have mentioned that national chains will sometimes request to look at the credit card when delivering. Most of the time that doesn't present a problem. A redditor pointed out that Dominos has a online gift card system that just requires an email. This seems to work really well since you don't have to coordinate time zone and other issues.

&gt;&gt;Finally

&gt;Please tell us how r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza got started.

&gt;&gt;Gad:  First a lot of credit goes to Rollout for advertising the subreddit

&gt;&gt;I created the subreddit in Dec of 2010. After being unemployed for 18 months
Nothing tastes quite as good some greasy hot food after months of PB&amp;J sandwiches. Additionally, I wanted to budget a bit a money a month to help others who may not be in dire straits, but could use a simple (random) pick me up.

&gt;&gt;I had intended to get the subreddit going as a place to provide others (and myself) an opportunity to help just a bit. I got sick during my Christmas vacation and then very busy with my new job

&gt;There must be some amazing stories in your 5 months. What's your favourite?

&gt;&gt;Roll:  I just enjoy success stories

&gt;&gt;Gad:  The best stories are the messages of thanks. To be honest

&gt;If you could

&gt;&gt;Gad:  I'd like larger user base. Right now we seem to have a good mix of Requesters and Fulfillers. I am a little concerned that a larger base might make it more unbalanced. As long as the growth is equally distributed then the more people being helped the better.

&gt;&gt;Roll:  I would also like to see more of a userbase

&gt;Your turn. Anyone

&gt;&gt;Roll:  I would have an issue giving a ""shoutout"" to anyone individually

&gt;&gt;Gad:  As I said earlier
Most of the credit goes to the community who has been great a fulfilling requests.

&gt;Finally

&gt;&gt;Gad: Since the subreddit is so small it currently hasn't had much of a freeloaders or fraud been a problem. I hope that with more growth we can still keep it simple

&gt;&gt;Roll:  Growth, more peperoni, more CHEESE!!!!!

&gt;&gt;Gad:  **p.s.**  I'd like to know how to get RSS notifications in my gmail address of new RAOP posts and Moderater Mail. I've tried a couple of RSStoEmail services,,False,self,t5_2sgno,True,,True

Do you love music ? Of course you do. [DONT LIE TO ME JACOB!](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/are-you-serious-rage-face.jpg). If you like music this is for you. Let me tell you a story...

#####*Once upon a time in the land of Fliggimites lived a happy little thing by the name of Joseph.  Joseph once decided to go on an adventure and go atop the great mountain of Floosh to annoy the red dragon.  And so he left, to Mount Floosh.  Along the way he stole the golden toe ring of a guy named Walmart, and met many trolls and elves and dwarves and other odd mutated humanoid creatures, including this one guy made out of bologna that we didn't like very much, so we laughed at him and he was sad.
#####So we finally reached the mountan of Floosh and hiked up to the top.  Then the red dragon appeared and tossed us in the firy lava pit on the top, and then we hiked back home, but Walmart trapped us and ate us.  
#####The end.*

Does the story connect to my feature in anyway. nope. i just found that somewhere in the internet. I just wanted to fill some space that's all &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

:) I'm done with my lecture/prophesying. Without further ado

&gt;What first sparked your interest in animation?

&gt;&gt;Late-90s/early-00s cartoons from my childhood such as Animaniacs

&gt;What sort of posts can one find in /r/animation?

&gt;&gt;Most posts I've seen are [animated shorts](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/ehd25/thought_of_you_by_ryan_woodward_simply_stunning/)

&gt;Have you made any sort of films yourself? If so

&gt;&gt;I've taken an animation and cinematography class in high school and I've been making shorts on and off since then, it is this: your digital and media work is less likely to stick around for years because external drivers are pieces of crap.

&gt;What are some of your favorite animations posted to this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;Oh dear

&gt;&gt;I've been watching these online animated shorts ever since I became mod of r/animation.

&gt;&gt;Let me say it this way: if it's on Vimeo, it is a spectacular short. Animation just seems like the best way to tell a story. It has this ability to make us fall in love with [imagined creatures](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/c68dq/what_one_astronaut_does_to_help_crater_face_meet/), [inanimate objects](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/k6u4l/little_boat/), or even [abstract shapes](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/dbj0i/spheremetrical_a_geometric_love_story_with/). Even the [lack of story](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/borpe/i_dont_know_whats_more_sick_the_song_or_the_fact/) doesn't deter the enjoyability of a short. I've seen animated shorts that [twist the framework of storytelling](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/det1o/best_animated_short_ive_seen_this_week_a/) and [make me laugh while still admiring the animator's handiwork](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/hs5xh/i_live_in_the_woods_a_wonderfully_demented/). And the way animators [push](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/djrl2/most_amazing_and_realistic_animation_ever_made_by/) the [limits](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/cycaj/the_coolest_thing_on_the_internet/) of the [medium](http://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/dtx7s/insane_music_video_blockhead_the_music_scene/) itself is a sight to behold.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/animation?

&gt;&gt;It is an absolute pleasure looking over your posts (except you spammers…tsk tsk). Keep sharing those animations that you have found or created. Our little reddit has had great submissions these past three years and I look forward to the next three ❤

You know what, thanks for your endless entertainment, thanks for the friends I've made, the comments I've received (good and bad), and the porn!  Oh, the porn!!  Thanks for the laughs, the tears, the grammar correction and most recently

So thanks reddit.  And while I'm at it, a great subreddit that features the ads you see every day.  Check out the posts, get involved in the discussion, but most important, please give your feedback and help the mods do their fine job!

/r/ads is a really cool subreddit that is very much like an old folks home.  All the regulars are there making a few nice comments about the nice things they saw on the reddit

I had the distinct pleasure of spending some time with the wonderful *jenakalif* who helps handle the sales of the 300x250 units for reddit along with pixelinaa

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;There are two standard types of ads on reddit: [sponsored headlines](http://imgur.com/XgU1b) and [300x250 units](http://imgur.com/eV5xd) in the right rail of the site. On 300x250 ad units across the site

&gt;I understand the Self-Serve Advertising program, here's an adorable sewer grate or an angry barn?""

&gt;&gt;spladug picks them generally. Check out [r/nonads](http://www.reddit.com/r/nonads) for all the non-ads and the credits for which users submitted the pics. :D

&gt;Have there been any interesting ad discussions? Any controversy?

&gt;&gt;We take a strong stand against a lot of advertising. We will not accept any ads with auto-play sound or any rich media, pop-up, catfish ads, and pretty much any other new annoying format that gets introduced. We do accept flash units (and always require a back up static image).

We always advise our clients that redditors are just like you. They don't want to see annoying advertising, flash ads can capture attention and tell an informative story, so it is a balancing act. I know we occasionally see complaints about those.

As for controversy, Hanna. We liked the description of the movie and the fact that the Chemical Brothers did the soundtrack. In the four days leading up to the premiere of the movie, we changed the masthead image into a series of depictions of the reddit alien as the main character of the movie. It caused some mixed reactions. The masthead will never be an advertising unit, and we didn't consider this as such at any point during the campaign — rather as a way to honor our interest in the movie and their advertising support. The masthead series was created by Kn0thing and served as a fun unobtrusive storyline leading up to the premiere. We will probably never do anything like that again though. Been there. Done that.

&gt;Anything cool happening in the world of reddit advertising? Anything we should watch out for?

&gt;&gt;The fourth quarter of the year is a busy time for advertisers and consequently for us. We have a number of cool ""pitches"" out on the table and are lining up advertisers. **Let me flip the question on y'all though: What would you like to see from us?**

&gt;What's the question you don't want me to ask?

&gt;&gt;I will be snarky and say that the one question I don't want you to ask would be: ""What's the question you don't want me to ask?""

&gt;Anything you want to say to the millions reading this right now?

&gt;&gt;We always appreciate feedback — both positive and negative. Your feedback helps us to clearly communicate to an advertiser what will ""resonate"" with the reddit community. We want to bring you advertisements and marketing programs that you can actually enjoy

Someday I'd like to come up with my own list of things that could save the world.  Labrador Retrievers would be on it, grilled cheese with dill pickles and bacon inside, (you see where this is going).  But common to everyone's list, (here it comes!), the number one spot (yes?) would be (oh God, oh God!) coffee! (YEaH!).

Coffee unites us, Barack Obama, Adele, and Omar Little from The Wire... and there was fresh coffee... I think I could hold court.  There's just something about good coffee that puts everything in it's place and gives perspective.  Problem?  Nothing's a problem while I have coffee in front of me.  

Choosing r/coffee was easy.  Getting these mods down off their caffeine induced drug trips

[fresh pots!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhdCslFcKFU)

It gives me great pleasure to share an evening with 2 mods from r/coffee

&gt;Please tell us how r/coffee began?

&gt;&gt;Mobius:  Well, which you can see: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/f1iyr/the_mod_over_at_rcoffee_has_been_inactive_for/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/f1j4p/time_to_get_new_moderation_here_in_rcoffee/).

&gt;&gt;So we came in here with the rough tough new mod squad and passively modded the small Reddit. I had a bunch of freetime then and jazzed up the place a bit too with things like custom CSS and later ""cupvotes"".
That brings us to here really

&gt;What's the best thing about your community?

&gt;&gt;Anomander:  The fact that we have so many people who really know their shit involved. We have a number of roasters who regularly contribute. I'm a (former) competitive-level barista, I guess.

&gt;&gt;Mobius:  I like the niche quality yet openess too. We have some really cool people here who work in the coffee business

&gt;Do you feel like there's a finite amount of things to talk about?

&gt;&gt;Mob:  Yes. In a similar way to the fact that I feel science will eventually discover everything. The universe is finite

&gt;&gt;That said, I love espresso, and barista-craft. I've spent six years absorbing relevant knowledge as voraciously as a full-time student has time for. I still know next to nothing compared to top-level experts. I know even less about brew coffee, much less roasting or growing or ... You get the idea.

&gt;&gt;Anoman:  Yes and no, I've been surprised at how much growth the subreddit has gone through and the posts don't seem to be stopping anytime soon!

&gt;Is coffee bad for you? Please enlighten us.

&gt;&gt;Mob:  Are you asking for medical advice? I didn't know people asked this question haha.   Well, I'm good. I don't really care about the health benefits or lack thereof to be honest though.

&gt;&gt;Anoman:  Only in the quantities I drink. In excess

&gt;What's the best cup of coffee you ever had? What was your most memorable?

&gt;&gt;MobiusCoffee:  This is probably a good time to say that I'm not really a coffee snob by anyone's measure. I drink more instant coffee than anything these days (on account of traveling), the people you are with, and the conversations shared. That said, I'll have to say the best cup of coffee I've had was one in Daegu, South Korea with my then new girlfriend. It was the first time we traveled into the city together and turned into a great day. As for the most memorable, I'd go with a cup of coffee I had in Kunming, China right before I performed a short story for the baristas through nervous cafinated sweat !

&gt;&gt;Anoman:  The first proper cappuccino I ever had. It was a Vivace ""Dolce"" espresso, and had a month to go before opening. The Chief had selected Vivace for our supplier from the start, but we had probably 12 bags from other roasters looking to pitch to us that we both felt we needed to serve due diligence on and test before we opened.  He started me off with his favourite espresso, into a flawless cappuccino. We then tried different permutations of espresso and milk for the rest of the day as he taught me how to use the machine and we sampled all the blends we'd been supplied with.  It was magical. I went home vibrating, but have loved coffee ever since.",,False,t5_2sgno,True

&gt;  What would we find at /r/trailers? What makes this place different from a place like iTunes Movie Trailers?

&gt;&gt;When I ""created"" /r/trailers I intended for it to be a place where movie trailers could be posted. I was thinking of, but it's open for whatever kind of stuff that people want to post, really. That's pretty much it. I don't know about iTunes Movie Trailers, but I suspect the content isn't member-driven in any fashion.

&gt;What makes a good trailer? Does big budget = success?

&gt;&gt;I'm not at all in the business

&gt;Give us some examples of excellent trailers that may have gone beneath our radar.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, I've definitely sought out the under-the-radar stuff, dating back to my exposure to and love of punk rock back in '83-'84)

&gt;&gt;I don't know... is there an easy way to ""search"" subreddits? Not sure exactly how that'd be done, 'cause I see subreddits as really the strength of Reddit in a way.

One thing I really enjoy about subreddits is that often you'll see a perfect balance.  In subreddits you get the information and expertise of an online forum, unload the truck, provide a bullet storm of cover, etc.  Because as I've said many times, the most important thing in the world is to be nice.  Pretty-with-great-calves helps, but nice'll get you much farther.

Today we celebrate /r/Cigars, informative, supportive, dashing, striking, hand-fucking-some afficionados who smell a bit like stale smoke.  Sorry, had to be said, I'm not going to lie or pretend I know the first thing about cigars.  We got SecretAgentMang here to cover that.  What I do know is good subreddits and good people.  Here at /r/Cigars you'll find active posts, it's a Goddamn smoking lounge

We're very pleased to have the super-amazing SecretAgentMang here.  Can I just tell you that meeting this individual was inspirational to say the least?  This dude works like a fiend to build his community &amp; keep it strong.  My hat is off to you SAMang

&gt;Normally we ask for a summary of your subreddit

&gt;&gt;This subreddit was lifeless for an entire year after its creation. It was not until ISmokeCigars took over as moderator 9 months ago that it started getting popular. Between then and now, and inquiries. It seems about every week or two we implement something new to make it a better subreddit.

&gt;You've seen some recent growth in both size and activity

&gt;&gt;Members have been starting up ‘smoking hangouts’ on Google+. A member will post a link to a live chat, and chat. Everyone is invited to join hangouts, and it happens almost every evening. The great part is we get to chat with members all over the world. Last month, an Aficionado from New York backpacked through Europe and ended up at another Aficionado’s house in Finland for a cigar!

&gt;Some are turned off by cigars because they don't like the smoke around them or the potential negative impact on their or your health. What do you say to this?

&gt;&gt; Cigar smoking is a hobby and passion, and likewise its critics. More often than not, cigar smokers respect the space and beliefs of those who are against it. As for health, we like to inform our members about the risks of smoking, and keep these facts in a thread on our sidebar.

&gt;What about those who might be looking to start? Any suggestions?

&gt;&gt;Our community has created a FAQ of cigar smoking; everything from how to cut the cigar

&gt;Give me 3 reasons why your subreddit is awesome.

&gt;&gt;(1). Monthly cigar trades are growing like mad. Anyone who is a redditor for longer than a month can participate

&gt;&gt;(2). Bombs. A bomb is when a member sends cigars to another member without their knowing. Nothing is expected in return

&gt;&gt;(3). Demeanor. What is great about /r/Cigars is that we are very different from most cigar forums. We accept the fact that there are no stupid questions

&gt;Any closing remarks counsellor?

&gt;&gt;If anyone has ever been curious about cigars, puffing away on a cigar. Come hang out in Reddit’s smoking lounge!

Hey all. Today's feature is all about the ABC sitcom Modern Family. I'm not gona lie: there's been a lot of buzz about this show. A lot of buzz. And good buzz at that. But as the bible says; judge yee not on buzz alone. Alas, have a look at [the official trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aogZUDx51vQ).

Here is atticus138 to fill you in on all the juicy goss...

&gt;## What is modern family?

&gt;&gt; It is an incredibly funny Mockumentary-style sitcom that airs on Wednesday nights on ABC. The show stars Ed O'Neill

&gt;## Ed O'Neill?! I'm sold! Climb us through the family tree...

&gt;&gt; The show takes place in the Los Angeles suburbs, from her previous marriage.


&gt;&gt; Claire Dunphy (Bowen) is Jay's daughter. She is married to Phil (Burrell) and they have 3 children, Ariel Winter and Nolan Gould). Phil tries so hard to be ""the cool dad"". He often plays the ""good cop"" to Claire's ""bad cop"" when it comes to disciplining the kids.


&gt;&gt; Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) is Jay's son. He and his partner, Mitchell is often the straight laced, no nonsense parent while Cam is more of the laid back, fun type.

&gt;## So who does the show revolve around? Who will we be rooting for as the season draws towards a finale?

&gt;&gt; Although Jay is the ""head of the family"" and actually billed as the top star

&gt;&gt; Phil and Claire's oldest daughter is Haley. She is portrayed as a steretypical ""bimbo"" teenager who is more concerned with friends and fashion than school. Alex is the middle daughter. She plays the cute nerd type and is the most intelligent of the three kids. She is often seen tricking or manipulating her siblings for her enjoyment. Luke is the youngest of the family. He is the ""innocent troublemaker"" of the family. He's a good kid, getting his head stuck between banister rails, convincing 13-year-old Manny to drive a car, etc.

Werewolves. Witches. Faeries. And *vampires who don't fucking sparkle*. Yes

Apparently show creator [Alan Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Ball_%28screenwriter%29#Film_and_television_career) was smoking some [G13](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=g13) (of course), he declared, ""Dude, I just got the best fucking idea for an HBO drama about robots! Except, you know, they're not really robots. They're like... they're like... *better* than robots, you know?"". Suddenly realizing that he was alone in his penthouse he giggled and promptly fell asleep.

After waking up the next morning he found a note he'd written to himself. The scrawled message simply read

With a shrug and a yawn he called his agent. ""Jerry

His agent replied: ""Great

Alan smiled and blurted: ""Robots!"" Suddenly he paused. *Where'd that come from?* he wondered. ""No

After exchanging some pleasantries he hung up the phone

*True Blood* became a huge success for HBO

Recently I sat down with /r/trueblood moderators MissLlil, and the /r/'s creator sfgeek. Here is the transcript of the resulting interview.  

&gt;In an age of Twilight hysteria

&gt;&gt; **MissLlil:** There were vampire stories before Twilight and I'm sure there will be plenty after. I don't see vampire stories going anywhere

&gt;&gt;True Blood is dirty, fucked up relationships and all around guilty-pleasure. That's how I'd describe it.

&gt;&gt;**HiddenTofu:** In addition,both positive and negative, and it doesn't have the teenage drama plotlines. Also, vampires do not shimmer. I would not want to see Eric or Bill covered in glitter like a bad art project. :)

&gt;&gt;**tlc:** No vampire show should be taken ""seriously""....all vampire stories are for fun

&gt;&gt;For someone that's never seen TB, it pokes a lot of fun at itself.

&gt;Why create the subreddit? For redditors who may already know and love the show but who are unfamiliar with /r/'s dedicated to specific books/shows/movies

&gt;&gt;**sfgeek:** One of my favorite things about True Blood has always been the conversation it sparks amongst friends of mine and I after each episode airs. I've always been amazed by the diversity of opinions and theories people have had about what a scene or bit of dialogue 'meant.' Reddit has been my home on the internet for over 5 years now

&gt;&gt;**tlc:** Why not? Alan Ball is legend and his shows get good reviews and a lot of people watching and talking. The sub is the perfect way to get this community of folks talking to each other about something they love.

&gt;&gt;**Missllil:** What they said

&gt;/r/'s dedicated to specific pieces of fiction often struggle with how to handle spoilers. How have you

&gt;&gt;**MissLlil:** We have a spoiler poilicy put into place as a guideline and spoiler tags (the tags are even colored different for book or tv talk)... BUT, either in the title or using tags in the text, and make sure there are no spoilers in the titles.

&gt;&gt;**tlc:** I don't think we've had too much issue with this one. Misllil is very good at catching things that shouldn't be in the sub and getting rid of them.

&gt;Your readers call themselves ""fangbangers"". You are aware that god hates fangs

&gt;&gt;**tlc:** Meh

&gt;&gt;**Missllil:** SPOILERS AHEAD - The Doctor loves True Blood and that's all that really matters. He did create the universe you know... well this time around anyhow.

&gt;Has your /r/ ever experienced any ""reddit drama""? If so

&gt;&gt;**tlc:** Again

&gt;&gt;**sfgeek:** We have, a big True Blood fan site owner was posting tons of content, which on the surface is great, but I felt it was a conflict of interest to be posting every one of your own articles. So, I banned her user, and she took it incredibly personally and was very hurt. I explained my rationale, but it still hurt to upset another fan like that. That experience has guided me to be as hands off as I can be as a mod.

&gt;&gt;**Missllil:** Everywhere you go there is drama, which storylines are good and bad.

&gt;Finally

&gt;&gt;**MissLlil:** What are your favorite subreddits or which subreddits do you think should be the next SROTD? Are you a fan or a fanatic of True Blood? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Toostie Pop? Do you think a Vampire could just bite into it with their sharp teeth? Do you think they have blood filled Tootsie Pops in that universe?

There are days when the sun refuses to shine, there's kindness only a few redditors away.  Now normally I would try to interject something breathtakingly clever right about here, some kind of joke or maybe a few Prince lyrics.  But I'm feelin' the sincerity of this subreddit so I'll hold off for now.   What I will share with you is that /r/MMFB not only exists for the cheerfully-challenged, the happy-handicapped, the delighted-disabled, the sparkling special-olympian... it also exists for those that are willing to lend a hand.  Maybe you know the difference between empathy and sympathy (I'll give you a hint, one has an orchestra!)

Yet another amazing subreddit that makes reddit an incredible place.  And you thought we'd run out of Subreddits to feature?  We've only begun to bring the awesome!

&gt;Hi there zjbird

&gt;&gt;Well, and in fact, were getting offended by a lot of the questions being asked. AMA really is Ask Me ANYTHING.

&gt;&gt;I was frustrated, I wanted to keep these somewhat seperate from IAmA, because it seemed to be ruining the spirit of that section. People should be able to ask any questions they want there, and they should be answered promptly. I can be a little harsh to people in the AmA section.

&gt;&gt;So, addressing the people who needed a pick-me-up, to get these people to post to MMFB. Within a few days, we hit 1000 viewers and the community has remained extremely kind and supportive to all who come in with life’s troubles.

&gt;So people write in with details of misfortunate events. Do you think all these posts are true? Are you not opening yourself up to scalawags with too much time on their hands?

&gt;&gt;I do think that the vast majority of posts are true. I can usually tell when something is fake

&gt;I suppose you're right.  Now what about within the comment section? Surely you've had some miscreants trolling for confrontation? How are you dealing with inappropriate comments?

&gt;&gt;That was my biggest fear. What actually ended up happening was pretty awesome

&gt;&gt;I was amazed, a lot of the answers were very simple, like “hang in there, it will get better” kind of answers. Sometimes, this really is all that’s needed, because people just want to know that when they are pouring their hearts out, someone is reading it and wishing them the best.

&gt;&gt;Fast forward a couple short months and this subreddit is unbelievable. I can’t even begin to express how proud I am at the way the community has progressed. The responses are extremely insightful. You see peoples lives changing from before and after they post sometimes and it truly is the most heartwarming thing I’ve ever witnessed on the internet. And I’ve seen that sloth try to cross the road video.

&gt;Tell me about your mod team. How were they assembled? What do they do?

&gt;&gt;Two of the mods, and FloridaOrange is one of the nicest people I know and my best friend.

&gt;What's the difference between /r/MMFB and /r/MakeMeFeelBetter? Did one get deleted?

&gt;&gt;I have tried to get /r/MakeMeFeelBetter

&gt;Your turn. Is there anyone you'd like to thank

&gt;&gt;Well thank you for interviewing me, and I just expected to complain about an IAmA trend and get downvoted. The community that developed out of that continues to astound me everyday. Thank you MMFB for helping me understand how compassionate people can be.

I know a lot of our picks contain an element of comedy and satire, subreddits are the driving force behind the future of Reddit. It takes a lot of time and energy to create a thriving new subreddit. Many, many subreddits have been created that embody an awesome concept, but don't have the moderators necessary to keep the subreddit alive, and are sitting neglected and unseen in the depths of Reddit.

I recently sat down with [BritishEnglishPolice](/user/BritishEnglishPolice), [/r/IAmA](/r/iama), [/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu](/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu), and [/r/science](/r/science). He generously agreed to take some time out of his busy schedule and answer a few questions about his subreddit, /r/needamod.

&gt;1. Since when have you been hauling from thrift stores?
&gt;&gt;I personally have been going to thrift stores since I was a little kid with my mom. Not much money back then so we made the best of it. Those days were nothing to marvel at. I have been going on my own personal thrift store quests since I was probably 19 or so. So about 7 years now.

&gt;2. What makes thrift store shopping different from regular shopping.
&gt;&gt;Thrift store shopping is much more fun than going to normal stores for a whole gambit of reasons. For one you can feel like a beast when you find something that is worth a lot that you can buy for just a few dollars. The mystique of searching through stuff that dates from current to decades ago. To be good at thrift store shopping you need to have a real hawkeye for stuff. You need to know what you are looking for. Or just have patients and look through everything.

&gt;3. What is the one thing you never want to find in a thrift store.
&gt;&gt;The thing you never want to find at a thrift store is the thing you want to find at a thrift store....but broken. I have gone on a warpath before after finding something awesome but it had been broken. So upsetting.

&gt;4. Is getting a high from finding good loot at a thrift store a real thing? Or is it just me. Tell me when you got it.
&gt;&gt;Of course getting a high from getting a high from some awesome find is real. It could be a feeling of IRL karma, in the same thrift store, I found a a couple dozen more Sega Genesis games, SNES games, an awesome jacket, and a Log Cabin 12"" cast Iron skillet. I like cooking....

&gt;5. What is the funniest thing you've found in a thrift store? If it has a background story
&gt;&gt;Probably not the items that were funny just what we did with them. Me and a couple friends happened upon some ridiculous clothing. Us being us, beaded shirts, super tight pants, thick glasses, a awesome pair of ruby colored sunglasses, and a white hair extension. It was a fun day.

&gt;6. Anything else you guys like to add?
&gt;&gt;Hey. Thanks for featuring us. Man, flee markets, boot sales, etc. I dont even require you to buy it. Sometimes something is so funny/bad you dont want to buy it. We want to see it still.

Love is... who that's a tough one.  Many, and it's different to each individual as they go through different ages and stages.  So the question is not ""What is love?"", the question is, ""What is love to you at this point in your life?""

So, but her situations is pretty sucky.  She's got a son with mental illness and things have pretty much bottomed out, yet she's still working overtime to do what she can.  She's buying groceries, taking care of the house, and all the while dealing with a terrible situation.  When I think about her, I'm pretty much floored by her ability to carry on.  

So my definition of love is that it's the force that motivates you to do what you can with what you have.  Really, giving someone comfort or companionship?  Are you making someone else feel good or validating them?  Are you identifying the needs and wants of others?

The second part is a little trickier, you're on the right path.  If you're willing to do everything you can to help another person, that's love.

Art has a very flexible definition; it means something different to practically everyone. Some try to find peaceful scenes for solace. Others look for works that force their thoughts into new conceptual territory. And yet others prefer pictures of dinosaurs shitting into each others mouths.

Beware, and have meandered their way to /r/WTFart. Strange landscapes, baboon mobs , frolicking Obamas, and clown dicks all lurk here. And that's just scraping the surface...Of course, if you make strange, disconcerting art yourself

aspec

&gt;What first triggered your interest in strange artworks?

&gt;&gt;I’ve had a real bad internet browsing habit since the dawn of time, and over time I developed a stronger taste for strange and over-the-top art. A pertinent example of this sort of thing is the [WTF Art livejournal community](http://wtf-art.livejournal.com/), which is obviously a huge inspiration for wtfart. I hope sharing that link isn’t too scandalous, since I’ve gratuitously borrowed a lot of content from that community to post here.

&gt;Who would be your favorite WTF artist? (historical or contemporary)

&gt;&gt;Hieronymus Bosch is the only visual artist I can think of off-hand whose work I would call my favorite. I don’t really keep tabs on any other individual artists. I like movies a lot. Some of my favorite “weird” directors are Harmony Korine, John Waters, David Cronenburg, and Todd Solondz. David Lynch is OK too.

&gt;In your opinion

&gt;&gt;Whether or not a work of art is “WTF”, but what ends up usually determining the popularity of a post is how aesthetically pleasing or technically well done that work is.

&gt;&gt;To more directly answer your question, and that uniquely affects what makes that art compelling. Many artists who aspire to be WTF end up relying too heavily on tricks or gimmicks, which results in shallow, forgettable art. The best weird art, in my opinion, subverts ideas, not just images. I don’t mean that artists need to write long theses for their work or something

&gt;Do you make any unusual artwork yourself? If so

&gt;&gt;I don’t

&gt;Do you have anything to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Have fun. It’s kind of true that there are no rules

Recently, shorts, knee socks... the kid was striking).  He had a small hand broom from his mom's closet, a gardening trowel and a big honkin' shovel from the garage which his stepdad told him to never use.  During the school year he'd only have an hour to pretend 'till his parents came home, but when summer vacation came, he'd have all day to go nuts.  His last days of school, his mind was totally on digging.  He never heard a thing his teacher said, ""summer's here""!

The next day, scrawny and have a head full of ideas, nothing stands in your way - except the often impenetrable terrain of Florida suburbia.  For 30 minutes, Dave jumped and danced but couldn't get the shovel to go more than 3 inches deep!  His back yard looked like it had psoriasis or some crazy shit, but he was determined to dig.  Finally he turned his sights to the rose garden where the soil was managable.  3 inches, 6 inches!  2 feet!  This was it!  Dave had discovered his first official site!  He worked all morning digging what he could, and it was about 11 a.m. when he made his first discovery.  A mandible.  Then, this is what archaeology is all about... you dig, and by dinner time

r/archaeology is one of those subreddits I'm really proud to feature

&gt;Please introduce yourself and tell us your history relating to archaeology.

&gt;&gt;I was a student at the University of Chicago for my undergraduate and graduate work in Egyptian archaeology and Egyptology. I also, and have worked in the Oriental Institute Archives as an assistant bibliographer. I am no longer a professional, but I remain abreast of current research through journals and my contacts within the community.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;Archaeology isn't just Indiana Jones (but, usually unearthed through 'digging', which is the careful removal of layer after layer of built-up sediment. We do NOT look at animal/dinosaur bones unless they pertain to human use. We do NOT look at prehistoric peoples, per se - that's usually anthropologists. 
There is also a great division in our field between Old World Archaeology and New World Archaeology, New World Archaeology is born out of later philosophical theory, looking more at social history and progressivism. Wow, sorry, that's a lot. **TL;DR - Archaeology is about unearthing stuff humans used/made in the past to discover more about history and past cultures.**

&gt;Describe your typical posts to us. What about your fanbase? Who's submitting these great posts?

&gt;&gt;Our subreddit is now 2000 readers+, but we're hoping to change that. We're also looking to create a class of self-identified 'specialists' so that we can do internal AMAs for specific fields/time periods/cultures.

&gt;Tell us why we should subscribe to r/archaeology.

&gt;&gt;Well, from Egypt to the Aztecs, from Japan to Stonehenge.

*Yeah

Before we go any further with today's featured sub, we'd select a subreddit each day and some would comment with a woohoo, some would give a yea-uh, but we lacked the depth (or width or height) to run with the big dogs.  I was absolutely blown away by the response we got when we asked you to voice your opinion on how we should best run things 'round here.  I'm extremely grateful for everyone's comments, so here's what we did and are doing...

1.  jaxspider

2.  We're working on a FAQ or Help page that gives everyone a better understanding as to our mission.  Frankly

3.  Waay more southern hemisphere man-cleavage &amp; exposed navels.

So please join me celebrating in today's featured subreddit, a community for 2 years.  I chose these wonderful folks for one very important reason, and I learned this from listening to the great documentarian Ken Burns on Adam Carolla's podcast.  I undersand his approach to making documentaries is to go in with some knowledge, but learn most of it along the way.  This way you are sharing with your audience what you have discovered, which is much more interesting that presenting information you already knowas if there was to be a quiz afterwards.  Seriously, that Ken Burns is one enlightened gentleman!

So, but you'll live.

And now
So here's to you
Never sweat the petty things.    
But always pet the sweaty things.

And now friends

&gt;To begin

&gt;&gt;I'm a family man, 2 cats, 29yrs old. Living in Milwaukee, the home of Miller. I work at a local TV station that helps me buy my passion.

&gt;Please tell us how you became interested (and knowledgeable) in the world of scotch whiskey.

&gt;&gt;Over the last year I started enjoying the spirit. I started slow and built my collection and matured my palate. I read a lot of reviews and watch a lot of Ralfy.com's. I came to this subreddit and contributed so much

&gt;Scotch is unique. Unlike other spirits

&gt;&gt;I would say Scotch is like beer in that category. Many different varieties and tastes. Something for everyone. Scotland has been perfecting their craft for a long time

&gt;One other thing I've learned is that much like wine

&gt;&gt;Like I said each region has a unique quality to them, and the highlands/speysides hover between. Each old distillery does have their own stories and they are very happy to share it one their websites. check out Johnnie Walkers story on youtube, thats a good one with Robert Carlyle walking you through.

&gt;Okay three scenarios

&gt;&gt;(1) 3rd date? if you're lucky to have a girl who likes Scotch before the 3rd date then she knows what she likes. if you're trying to introduce her

&gt;&gt;(2) with a friend celebrating? for me its a double dram of Laphroaig Quarter Cask! 

&gt;&gt;(3) a gift for granddad (if he were alive) I would probably do something mellow yet flavorful and warming like Springbank 10 or Highland Park 18.

&gt;Please tell us why we should subscribe to r/scotch.

&gt;&gt;Subscribe to r/scotch if you love scotch, or want to get into it. We all love to help, we are a wonderful community of whisky enthusiasts and are always up for any discussion even if its been discussed at length before.

&gt;Anything else I've forgotten? Anything you'd like to add?

&gt;&gt;I would like to add that all are welcome to share opinions and share knowledge. we're all in this together and we love to learn more and more about Scotch Whisky. join us! cheers.

I'm going to be blunt here: this is *not* exactly the most exciting of subreddits. You're not going to find any pictures of dragons being slain by 12th level elves, perhaps most shocking of all, pictures of cute kittens. However, if you're a business owner who is interested in using reddit.com's self-serve advertising platform (and why wouldn't you be?), this subreddit is a definite must.

When I first stumbled across this subreddit I barely gave it a second look. However

While I'm not currently in the market for any advertising right now I found exploring all the questions, turns out, is an excellent way of getting a look behind the scenes of how those unobtrusive ads (you know, the ones that help keep the lights on at reddit com?) are created.

In short, or want to have your voice heard by some companies that advertise on this site, /r/selfserve is also a wonderful community to browse.

Recently I invited moderators jenakalif and krispykrackers to my Madison Avenue corner-office to discuss this subreddit all Don Draper style. The following is what I can remember of our bourbon-fueled discussion. 

***

&gt;Explain like I'm a business owner brand new to reddit: what are self-serve ads on this site and why would I want to use them? 

&gt;&gt;**jenakalif**: Self-serve refers to reddit's self-serve advertising platform. This platform allows advertisers to purchase (at commitments as low as $20/day) an advertising unit known as the reddit sponsored headline. If you visit reddit's frontpage or many subreddits across the site, [go here](http://www.reddit.com/selfserviceoatmeal). To set up an ad, [click here](http://www.reddit.com/promoted/new_promo). 

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers**: Everything Jena said, we think (hope!) the community as well as the client can benefit equally, learn from each other, and grow.

&gt;Do you happen to know if moderators of subreddits have the ability to check and see if someone has selected their /r/ for a targeted ad? I ask because I've never seen one at /r/asoiaf or here at /r/SROTD (the two main subreddits I moderate for) and would be curious to know. 

&gt;&gt;**jenakalif**: At this time there is not a way for moderators to view the ads that are targeted to their subreddit. The best way to check is to load the community page

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers**: Also, if you see something that is super niche, that may clue you in to an ad being run on a smaller subreddit that you are subscribed to!

&gt;Do the reddit admins and/or staff participate in your subreddit? Do you know if they're aware of your existence? 

&gt;&gt;**jenakalif**: The community was created by Kn0thing, who helps redditors out virtually 24/7, monitors this subreddit and the selfservicepromotion@reddit.com email address for any issues or questions that arise around the platform. 

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers**: Yes, and thank you kindly for featuring us as your SRotD.

&gt;Do you happen to know how successful the self-serve ads have been for reddit? Have they become a major part of the company's business model

&gt;&gt;**jenakalif**: The self-serve ads have been very successful for both advertisers and the reddit community at large. IMHO they don't interfere with the performance or usability of the site. They allow users to interact with the content much like all other content on reddit. They also yield higher than average performance metrics (we've seen some headlines averaging 1-2% ctrs with hundreds of comments and votes). This platform is still version 1. We've got awesome ideas in the works to make the platform even more awesome.

&gt;&gt;**krispykrackers**: They have been very successful as jenakalif said.  Looking at weekly metrics, ad policies/approval, and special requests — we've gotten very efficient at juggling all the different aspects of the platform.  Looking forward to V2!

&gt;I feel I've taken a risk in choosing such a niche and technical subreddit to feature this week. Now I'm cold and there are wolves after me. Should I go over to /r/MMFB? 

&gt;&gt;**Both**: ಠ_ಠ

***

My thanks to jenakalif and krispykrackers for the interview, I need to nurse my hangover and try to get the stink of cigarette smoke out of my clothing. Peace!

Now, are still nay-saying, ""Jesus, really? All this over some music? You must be severely emotionally imbalanced."" To which I would reply: How dare you? Accusations like that make me want to shave off your pubes, glue them to your face, then burn your house down. 

*whew* 

Count down from ten

Great, I guess I'm done here, so I'll let the mods of /r/CrappyMusic explain the subreddit themselves. Take it away, feedthecollapse, pikatore and assumetehposition!

&gt;Why do you moderate /r/crappymusic?

&gt;&gt;feedthecollapse: Admin Assumetehposition told me I had great taste in crappy music.

&gt;&gt;pikatore: I applied because I believe crappy music is a good indicator of the end times

&gt;&gt;assumetehposition: Crappy music has been a passion of mine since the days of William Hung, and learn how to hold instruments, and to record the noises they make and post them on Youtube for the bemusement of many.

&gt;Do you look for anything in particular in your crappy music? (i.e strange lyrics

&gt;&gt;ftc:A bit of all those, they're ICP.

&gt;&gt;p: A big one is the artist taking themselves seriously in the clip. That combined with whatever crappy stuff multiplies the hilarity

&gt;&gt;p: Oh

&gt;&gt;atp: Oh yes all of those things are great

&gt;Who/what is your music guilty pleasure?

&gt;&gt;ftc: ""Guilty pleasure"" might be a bit strong

&gt;&gt;p: I have a weakness for disco. The funkier

&gt;&gt;atp: Without any irony, Nordic metal.

&gt;Do any particular types of music get posted more often than others? If so

&gt;&gt;ftc: White teenagers rapping.

&gt;&gt;p: Bad rappers seem to be the main course here... I'm guessing because you don't need to much effort to rap something and then upload it.

&gt;&gt;atp: Definitely hip-hop/rap. I would love to see more show tunes but I guess I'll have to be patient.

&gt;Worst genre/band/song?

&gt;&gt;ftc: Hm, with the linked song probably being the worst overall song.

&gt;&gt;p: Some of our submissions are so genre-neutral they literally define their own

&gt;&gt;p:I'd say the word song I've heard has either been done by RAED... that guy just blows my mind.

&gt;&gt;atp: I'll second and third the other mods... RAED is the very embodiment of crappy music. He's a guy who thinks he's cool convincing his friends to record him singing and rapping

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/CrappyMusic?

&gt;&gt;ftc: even though you should be ashamed for unleashing these monstrosities on the world

&gt;&gt;p: Keep the good submissions coming... we're documenting the downfall of humanity. It's our duty.

&gt;&gt;atp: I like turtles.",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/p1g1b/january_29_2012_rcrappymusic_what_a_piece_of/

In a world full of soul-sucking responsibilities, engage in discussions about meaningful distractions.  Don't you just want to recharge?

Of course you do!  It's what the subreddits are aboot!  It's why we're here, you really should check this place out.  It's really fun there, everyone is having a blast and there's an amazing vibe that should be bottled and sold!  I'm proud to feature this subreddit today because they most definitely have a code.

Here to discuss this most amazing, please post them below.  goldegl will gladly take your calls.

&gt;Please explain pokeents. What's the history of this here community?

&gt;&gt;r/Pokeents has been a community for a little over 5 months now and was created in response to the controversy that arose when something weed related was posted in r/Pokemon.

&gt;&gt;Pokemon is generally marketed towards kids, but a fair number of downvotes as well. It was always great as a Pokemon fan and a fan of the herb to see crossovers, but there was always resistance.

&gt;&gt;Pokemon came out in the mid 90's, or just out of it. What happens in college? Let's just say a lot of experimentation. So what we have is a mix of an adult hobby with a nostalgic hobby from childhood. A perfect mix!

&gt;&gt;The subreddit itself came about after [a post I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/gpumf/any_other_pokeents_out_there/) of a picture I took while smoking and playing the Pokemon card game with my old roommates. I had been out of the Pokemon loop for a while and had bought a big lot of cheap cards for nostalgia's sake. I asked if there were any other ""Poke-Ents"" out there, apparently, not Poke-Ents.
Drawnincircles made the subreddit, did ya?

&gt;Now tell us about yourself goldegl! Give us the lowdown on who you are (and what makes you so damn amazing!!) What's your background on pokemon and herb?

&gt;&gt;Oh

&gt;&gt;I'm a 25 year old guy from Alabama. I started playing Pokemon when the original games came out, so I tried to jump into those... but that wasn't good enough. So I tried emulators for later generations, but that wasn't cutting it for me. I was fortunate enough to get a DS for my arbitrary day gift, and I quickly got Pokemon White (one of the most recent generations of games that had just come out). That was it. I was back in.

&gt;&gt;I had also started collecting the cards again and was working towards having a legal tournament deck for tournaments. My girlfriend is awesome enough to have embraced my seemingly childish obsession

&gt;&gt;Meanwhile I have been a proud ent for years... So when the opportunity came up to work on a subreddit that was directly correlated with two of my main interests, and try and make it (and keep it) great.

&gt;Please describe your community members. I'm guessing you have a few things in common?

&gt;&gt;The Pokeents in the community are wonderful people. Not only are there frequent discussions regarding a ""chill"" attitude towards the Pokemon Universe as well as discussions on how smoking has influenced some decisions made during gameplay while under the influence (like naming your whole team 'Steve' and realizing it later on), I feel like the subreddit matters that much more.

&gt;Anything on the horizon?

&gt;&gt;Currently, but as of now we have people from 4 continents and something like 11 countries.

&gt;&gt;I have also just enacted the ability to add your favorite Pokemon Trainer's name next to your username. Only human characters

&gt;&gt;The main thing I'm looking forward to for r/Pokeents involves some major work a few community members have been working on. You can see from the header that a member created 3 ent related Pokemon sprites. Amazing on their own, if you will. Yes, we have a community where an actual Pokemon/Trees hybrid game is being created! It really is a great place and they really are great people.

&gt;Your turn - who do you want to acknowledge?

&gt;&gt;I really want to thank Drawnincircles and Plasma_Panda for being great co-mods, I want to thank everyone who submits content. Those are the people who make the community special.

Thanks goldegl for keeping the great vibe alive and making reddit a more interesting place.  Have a great day!",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/kom7k/september_23_2011_rpokeents_gotta_catch_em_all_vs/

Post: [""I've never given the Grateful Dead a chance

Reply: *""...Dude

Reply2: *""Me too

Perhaps the Grateful Dead's work isn't on your radar, I encourage you to spend some time at /r/GratefulDead.

In the words of moderator *the-cakeboss*, but since joining this subreddit and subsequently delving into the GD catalog my life has changed for better.

Here to discuss their fantastic subreddit is MrDanger and Infinitezen

&gt;Please tell us what we'll find at /r/GratefulDead. For someone with no Dead experience

&gt;&gt;MrDanger:  Everyone's welcome. Old heads, dilettantes, anyone with an interest in Grateful Dead music and the subculture. You don't need to know a thing about the Dead when you get here. Just gotta poke around, listen to some of the music suggestions, read some of the stories and articles, ask questions. Dance like nobody's watching, man. 

&gt;&gt;Infinitezen:  For a bunch of music geeks

&gt;Please explain the concept or culture of acquiring GD tapes of shows. How's that work?

&gt;&gt;MrD:  2.The band's career began in 1965 and continues to this day, too, and almost all of it has yielded band-blessed live bootleg recordings, tens of thousands of hours of the stuff. Fans have been trading first tapes, then CDs and finally torrents since the earliest days. There are legendary performances and personal favorites, shows people have attended or that mark significant dates that heads want to share with other heads. In the early days people swapped them hand-to-hand or in the mail, but with archive.org hosting some 3, do some adventurous exploring with the links to we've put together.

&gt;&gt;Iz:  The culture is born out of the fact that to really understand the Dead, the only way to do this was through tapers and exchanges. Nowadays, you can access tons of great shows through Nugs.net, Archive.org, or Torrent some Dicks Picks.

&gt;Please address the kindness of your readership / fanbase. How did this come to be?

&gt;&gt;Iz:  The kindness of the fanbase is due to many factors, to the wide eyed noobs, we all love the music and (hopefully) also come to these shows to connect with humanity on a deep level.

&gt;&gt;MrD:  What you see on r/GRATEFULDEAD, is a holdover from the way we operate in real life. In the old days you could show up to a Dead show without a nickle in your pocket and end up fed and cared for. At a Dead show there was this palpable feeling we were all brothers and sisters who loved one another deeply and wanted to be cool to each other, either on the road or at the jamboree. Deadheads have always been a really accepting bunch no matter where you came from as long as you just wanted to throw in and do your thing to make the whole trip better.

&gt;What's your favourite thing about modding for /r/GratefulDead.

&gt;&gt;MrD:  The headditors. Just being with other like minds who know what's up, man.

&gt;&gt;Iz:  My favorite thing is that they made me a Mod merely for making some quality contributions, we can exist largely self sufficiently (at shows anyway) without a need for Police or forms of security in order to feel safe.

&gt;Anything you'd like to talk about? I'm listening!

&gt;&gt;Iz:  I would just like to once again affirm that the Dead are more than just a band, and the Jams are mind bending explorations of music. I don't think there has ever been a band with such a strong combination of both.

Okay, no motorcars.  Just you, some friends, a million bugs, some pemmican, some gorp, some deet, blisters, leeches, giardia

r/CampingandHiking is a really great subreddit that I highly recommend you check out if you're considering leaving the confines of your basement / battlestation.  Here you'll find great people who enjoy not only the great outdoors

To help us better understand this great subreddit

&gt;How did r/campingandhiking come to be?

&gt;&gt;GEB: R/campingAndHiking was started almost 3 years ago, there was little activity and only a few people after 6 months of existence, so I decided I could do better.

&gt;&gt;From there I posted relevant articles when I could and mentioned r/campingandhiking when I found camping related posts. And eventually reached out to other moderators to cross-link outdoors reddits. After doing that
](http://www.redditlist.com/dir/5775/Outdoors) and the [subscriber statistics for r/campingandhiking](http://www.redditlist.com/stats/CampingandHiking). We are now around the 350th largest subreddit and gaining!

&gt;&gt;I met Tundrawolf the first time through similar discussions about overlap of reddits over at r/climbing and r/rockclimbing. After seeing him posting all the time in different outdoors subreddits

&gt;How are you different from r/camping? May I ask

&gt;&gt;TW:  Don't get me started on subreddit woes. I've long thought reddit needs a better categorization system. Imagine ""/r/campingAndHiking"" and ""/r/ultralight"" are children of a parent ""/r/outdoors"" subreddit. If you subscribe to /r/outdoors, so you can unsubscribe from /r/ultralight but still see the rest of /r/outdoors. Ultralight posts just drop from your /r/outdoors view.
I do application integration as my trade

&gt;&gt;GEB:  As I said
Fast forward to about 2 months ago. I checked the subreddit and the moderator cancelled their account

&gt;&gt;We talked it over with the folks on both subreddits and some felt there was enough of a difference in casual camping vs backcountry camping. So that's the current distinction between the two.

&gt;Please summarize the type of stuff we'll find at r/campingandhiking.

&gt;&gt;GEB:  All sorts of camping tricks, destinations, photos. Gear weight reduction is always popular, but more so at r/ultralight. So are hammocks. There is a lot of good stuff after our few years. Definitely read through it!

&gt;&gt;TW:  The thing I really enjoy most about /r/campingAndHiking is the experienced users we have. I could ask a post about desert camping in the Gobi desert and I'll get a response from some user who worked in the desert for 6 months and here are 20 tips to make life easier.

&gt;Normally at some point I try some ""gotcha journalism"", nefarious posts OR things you'd like to change at r/CandH?

&gt;&gt;TW:  I rather enjoy the subreddit. It's got a great signal to noise ratio

&gt;&gt;GEB:   mostly want to thank all the awesome people that submit articles and leave comments. An extra thanks goes to the people writing up trip reports and taking photos. Those are the best. Also thanks should go to the moderators of all the other outdoors subreddits for working together! It wouldn't be this cool without all you.

&gt;Why the interest in camping and hiking?

&gt;&gt;GEB:  My first major camping trip was at age 11 in western Montana with my then step-dad and brothers. After hiking a 6 mile trail with almost a mile of vertical gain and only 84 oz of water for 5 of us (until we got to a waterfall near-ish to the top), but it only dumped on the fire (took an hour to start in the first place) or was too smokey to manage to drink. Snowbanks were luckily still there in spots, but ice melts soooo slow.

&gt;&gt;TW:  I grew up in nowhere
I really like the challenge of hiking

&gt;&gt;I've been doing solo hikes lately and it's really astonishing the mental dialogue you can have with yourself after days of solitude.


&gt;&gt;It's solid fun, and it's great exercise. It does make working in a cubicle harder and harder :)

Hello

Two of the delightful moderators of /r/proper


&gt;What caused /r/proper to come into fruition?

&gt;&gt;z:The Proper English reddit was created in response to an increased awareness of the usage

&gt;&gt;fb:'Twas a response to the multitude of riff-raffs and malcontented shrews on our dear reddit.

&gt;How does one become a proper lady or gentleman? What advice to you have to aid this transition?

&gt;&gt;z:People were historically raised in a proper manner by their family and in keeping with their social class. In today’s day and age, and especially employing the use of proper language.

&gt;Who

&gt;&gt;z:Sean Connery.

&gt;&gt;fb:The Most Interesting Man In The World.

&gt;What hopes do you have for the future of the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;z:I hope that the Proper English reddit will continue to provide a forum for those of us who enjoy a certain quality of company and conversation.

&gt;&gt;fb:To one day host an AMA for

&gt;What rule of etiquette do you believe to be the most important?

&gt;&gt;z:Respect.

&gt;&gt;fb:Be excellent to each other.

&gt;Do you have a message for the right honourable readers of /r/proper?

&gt;&gt;z:I'm really happy with what you have all done with the Proper English reddit and the exemplary manner with which you comport yourselves.
&gt;&gt;Cheerio.

So, what would your dad want as a present?  How about an old school razor?!  But where in the world would you find more information on shaving than you could ever need?  Right here Jimmy.  It's r/wicked_edge and it's wicked_awesome!  They've got volumes and volumes of information on the art of shaving with a double edge and single edge razor. You'll begin to enjoy the formerly mundane now exciting act of shaving.  Pretty soon you won't have anything left to complain about 'cept gettin' too much strange, nome sayin'?

This subreddit is filthy with helpful individuals willing to answer your questions.  That's why it was chosen - if you look at the posts (and they do get many each day), helpful and really supportive.  Please check out [r/wicked_edge](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge) and help us celebrate yet another subreddit who has the awesome.

**Edit!** Now a beautifully relaxing afternoon with the suavest of the suave

&gt;Please describe r/wicked_edge.

&gt;&gt;r/wicked_edge is a wetshaving/old school razor group. Everything from basic questions to advanced restoration tutorials to razor porn are fair game. I do an occasional ""test drive"" post where I'll buy some weird old razor or new product and see if I can shave with it (some work

&gt;You have a very active fan base for something that seems quite simple. (Lather

&gt;&gt;It seems so simple doesn't it. Wetshaving is all about maintaining lubrication and hydration throughout the process. The brush used to build the lather gives better lift to your beard and helps to remove dead skin. The soap is more lubricating than canned foams or gels. The razor - single or double edge or the straight razor are able to cut better thanks to the user being able to adjust the angle of attack - and also strip off dead skin. All of this in combination with some aftercare products make it a much better final result. Now when you combine all the products/hardware/techniques it makes for some interesting discussions.

&gt;What's your take on Mach 8's and disposables vs. double edge razors?

&gt;&gt;I get that a lot and really it's whatever works for you. Straight/double edge wetshaving takes time and patience to get good at

&gt;Any comments on electric razors?

&gt;&gt;I used an electric for many years because it was the only thing at the time that didn't tear up my neck. Fast

&gt;What's your favourite thing about r/wicked_edge? If you could change one thing

&gt;&gt;The community that developed really stands out for me. A lot of other places you get the ""oh not this question again"" or ""n00b"" responses - here it's not an issue. Me and another user Commiecat have a bit of a game right now to see who can respond first to a straight razor question (I'm losing badly at the moment) and the rest are welcoming and cheerful to all - seriously cool group I have to say. I'd like to see more diverse posts though. We have had a few pics of new gear someone has bought but it's mostly questions from beginners. Now having said that we have had a member join the group who has been posting how-to videos. Mantic59 of the youtube shavetutor series has been a great source of info and help to a lot of us when starting out and his new video posts are a great break in the routine.

&gt;Any shout outs? Anyone you'd like to thank or headbutt?

So sorry for the late submission.  My agent and I were in talks all night with exectives from the ""big three"".  Long story short, not a subreddit about hygiene.

&gt;Could you please tell us a little bit about yourself?

&gt;&gt;I’m an average redditor with cats and a love of bugs. Neither of the cats give a crap about bugs though. Since this is a team effort, quantum_spintronic, and spinozasrobot (creator of the new FAQ). Thank you. 

&gt;Why did you decide to start r/whatsthisbug?

&gt;&gt;There had been a bunch of submissions to r/pics asking for bug ID help (and suggestions for how to most effectively kill it and everything within 10 miles), our inaugural bug, and just went from there. Turns out, it’s pretty fun to see a weird bug and puzzle out what it is. 

&gt;How does the subreddit work? 

&gt;&gt;Ideally, but I think it’s also a casual subreddit where we just want to check out cool bugs. We’ll usually try to figure out just about anything you submit though.  Bug has a quite specific meaning, entomologically speaking, but means anything creepy/crawly to most of us around here I think. For example, we've had people submit giant worms for ID. 

&gt;Has there ever been a bug that stumped you?

&gt;&gt;All the time. Most of us are amateurs

&gt;What is your favorite submission? 

&gt;&gt;My personal favorite was pretty recent actually. Just coincidence that I happened to correctly ID it. I'm sure the other guys have some good favorites...perhaps they'll share. 

&gt;What would you like the future to hold for r/whatsthisbug? 

&gt;&gt;Just more bugs. It would great it if people started going around with cameras and bug hunting to submit their pics here. I’m just pleased people still come around really. Ultimately

&gt;Any final comments for the audience of SRotD?

I'm going to file this one under, Was pleasantly surprised.""   

When I first learned about this place, the smell from opening a can of tennis balls, finding Chapstick between the cushions when your lips are on fire, bank errors in your favour and Arizona Ice Tea on sale.  You know, posts about stuff that make us feel amazing.  I thought it would be cool posts and 5 redditors in the comment section saying, ""I know, right?!""  So I'm going to stop you right there before you make an ass of yourself - this subreddit is totally not that at all.  *Seriously

The greatest thing about this place is the spectrum of emotion.  Dat feel is plural, the very definition of a community!  It's the perfect subreddit!

Dat feel is the best part about reddit.  It's people with their own set of experiences coming together, let's invite *Sciarrino*, a great moderator at [/r/datfeel](/r/datfeel) to fully explain this place.

&gt;Can you explain your subreddit to everyone in your own words?

&gt;&gt;To give a quick description of the subreddit I would have to say that we are a very open and caring community. We enjoy having others come and open up to us and we encourage them to

&gt;What drives this subreddit? What keeps it alive

&gt;&gt;A lot of people are coming on here and just opening up what they feel with no regrets. In turn, mentions a feel they experienced that day and it is open for discussion, or you can mention your own personal feel from your day in the comment section.

&gt;What's the discussion section like? Do you get many opposing or contrary comments or is it pretty much a bunch of redditors agreeing with the original poster?

&gt;&gt;Discussion is pretty much anyone who can relate or offer sound advice to the OP

&gt;I'm surprised to see the whole spectrum of emotions represented. What about this place surprises you as a moderator?

&gt;&gt;What surprises us the most as the moderators is the ability for our subscribers to open up with their emotions. There is one thread in particular, nor did we ask for such detailed tales. But, because of what this person was experiencing he used this subreddit to get stuff of his chest and we replied with open arms.

&gt;What would you change about this place?

&gt;&gt;The subscribers are amazing and the feels are fantastic

&gt;Anything you'd like to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;To all our subscribers: We appreciate the support you continue to provide to the subreddit and each other

Outside the Post Office, that's for damn sure. It was said he could track down a run-away bandit in less than two days. A town hero of sorts, and a tall glass of water if I had ever seen one. 

Jacob waved Thomas over from across the street and leaned up against the gnarled wooden railing along the porch of his post office. He was holding the freshly written telegraph from Dorchester in one hand and a freshly rolled cigarette in the other. 

""Message came down the wire for you Thom"", if you push that paint of yours to run it"".

I set up an interview with Mr. Kmmokai, as we very well can guess that Kmmokai probably said some hurtful things he didn't really mean.

As soon as our infamous friend sends me the above-mentioned responses they will be posted here as an edit. Until then

---

***INTERVIEW!***

Everyone give a big round of applause for the man of the hour! *APPLAUSE*

&gt; 1.) So
&gt;&gt; Kmmokai: I'm a staff writer. I write about Web communities. Our basic premise is that the web is a place
The Internet is important. It’s also fucking absurd. We write about all of it.
As for myself: I have brown hair. I’m not tall. I like Irish whiskey and spicy food. At one point I was a semi-professional soccer player in China.
That’s a lie.
(I’m a liar
I was given beer and food in exchange for chasing a ball

&gt; 2.) So what's the deal with this r/dailydot subreddit? It looks like a  r/TLDR
&gt;&gt; Kmmokai: Right now r/dailydot is a daily Reddit digest and a weekly Reddit news summary. It’s a good place to go if, sweet Reddit that you craved. Minus the rage comics. And porn (except when it’s newsworthy.)
That said: I have all kinds of mad science journalism experiments I want to conduct with r/dailydot once/if it grows. Reddit is a powerful platform for democratizing content and news. I’d like to turn that power inward
But

&gt; 3.) If you could write for a cartoon
&gt;&gt; Kmmokai: This is the worst cartoon ever. It’s called Francis McTodd and stars Francis McTodd
But Francis does the same thing every fucking day. Nothing ever changes. He gets up, and goes home. You hate this cartoon.
On the final episode of the season
His boss shrugs. “This is your new job
Francis opens the box. The camera zooms in.
All you see is Francis’ eye reflecting a burst of golden light.
Everything fades to black.
Actually
Never mind.

&gt; 4.) What Subbreddits do you frequently browse? The worlds awaits eagerly to find out:
&gt;&gt; Kmmokai: I regularly browse everything I can. [/r/askscience](/r/askscience)

&gt; 5.) If you were stranded on a deserted island
&gt;&gt; Kmmokai: In the Aeroplane Over the Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel / Harvest Moon - Neil Young / I’m Your Man / Leonard Cohen.

&gt; 6.) Whitey-Tighties
&gt;&gt; Kmmokai: Boxer briefs

No surprises as to why we selected these fine folks as today's Subreddit of the Day.  They've got a great idea, unpaid efforts.  If you have an image you need altered, something created from the grass roots level, I highly recommend you set your sights on /r/picrequests.

Here to help us understand /r/picrequests is tomtim90, keeps it real.

&gt;Hi tomtim90.  Requests for photoshop

&gt;&gt;/r/picrequests is a place that people can post a request for photoshop work or drawings. The only other things that we do here is help people who have gotten stuck doing their own photoshop work and helping people identify what techniques were applied to an existing photo.

&gt;&gt;**edit:**  squeaki (another handsome mod) adds this! *I've put a video together for a NYC lawyer, then... dun dun ddurrrr gets down on one knee- the rest is history.*

&gt;Tell us what kind of requests you see.

&gt;&gt;Many of the requests we see are silly in nature. People want faces swapped, people need backgrounds removed, redeye fixed, trash digitally taken out of a picture, or a portrait touched up.

&gt;How does the fee-for-service work?

&gt;&gt;The paid request service uses a verification system similar to /r/IAMA. When people post a paid request, such as using just thumbnails until the request is finished to protect the time and money of both the poster and the fulfiller.

&gt;What's your favourite type of requests?

&gt;&gt;I personally love the silly requests. Face swaps or ""do something crazy"" posts are generally a lot of fun and allow for creativity on the part of the people fulfilling requests. The posts asking for help coloring and fixing old photographs are always a good challenge too.

&gt;Finally

&gt;&gt;This community sprung out of necessity when people started asking for photoshop requests in /r/photoshop. /r/favors has rules against photoshop requests if they aren't offers and we found ourselves bombarded. We made a place for those requests here at /r/picrequests. Anyone can help with the creations. For the most part

War. It is the one thing man has known since the beginning of civilization. Wars have been started over a range of things

In olden times, fake stories, and memes. 

Now you can't really battle fake stories because they'd have to tell more and more absurd stories trying to top each other to compete. This would render them useless

Last year's winner was [Forever Alone.](http://www.reddit.com/tb/gvr7e) Truly a master of the term, full details over in /r/TournamentOfMemes. Now on to the Q &amp; A with the mods from r/TOM.

&gt;1 How did you get involved with TOM (/r/TournamentOfMemes)?

&gt;&gt; **brody10123** It was early June and I happened to be on /r/foreveralone. I notice that they had an announcement saying ""Winner of the 2011 Tournament of Memes"" in the sidebar. I clicked it, /r/tournamentofmemes2. I asked Craysh, who ran the tournament last year for advice, and he made me a mod of the main sub. And here we are.

&gt;&gt; **The_Penguin_In_A_Zoo** I asked nicely... that's pretty much it i saw the rage comic for it (it was pretty much an advertisement) saw that brody needed a new mod i replied first became a mod (Extra detail:this was within the my first 2 days of redditing and i was astonished)

&gt;&gt;**CedarWolf** I really enjoyed last year's Tournament Of Memes (Courage Wolf all the way!) and a few months ago I sent a message to the TOM mods asking if and when we'd have a new Tournament. About a month ago, so here I am. So far, it's been fun.

&gt;&gt;**GreggoryBasore** Last year I voted in the tournament rounds and posted some commentary memes in /r/adviceanimals. This year I offered a suggestion for the tournament that resulted in me getting turned into a mod so I could implement that.

&gt;2 How will this year's TOM be different than last?

&gt;&gt; **brody10123** For one thing, and the winner of the pool gets 12 months of Reddit Gold and a Reddit sweatshirt (thank you hueypriest).

&gt;&gt; **The_Penguin_In_A_Zoo** Well its all about karma...

&gt;&gt;**CedarWolf** As I mentioned, and I've been making the graphics. All those little icons on the bracket were custom-fitted; I tried hard to make each little 40x40 square as easily recognizable as possible, and I hope it helps. For example, I didn't know who the deuce Jimmy McMillan was, but I instantly recognize The Rent Is Too Damn High Guy.

&gt;&gt;**GreggoryBasore** My suggestion for this year was a betting pool which I'll be running. This gives the tournament an extra level of participation an excitement.

&gt;3 Can't we live in peace where all memes can live together in harmony? Why must this Tournament be a battle to the death?

&gt;&gt; **brody10123** Is it a battle for the death? Or is it a battle for new life? If Socially Awesome Penguin gets eliminated

&gt;&gt; **The_Penguin_In_A_Zoo** Good guy Greg the entire point of his meme is to do good things...while smoking some drugs

&gt;&gt;**CedarWolf** Because there's always going to be a top meme

&gt;&gt;**GreggoryBasore** I don't see the tournament as a death match

&gt;4 Whats that one meme

&gt;&gt; **brody10123** Tech Impaired Duck memes are forced and generally unfunny. On that note I am a fan of that meme with all of its faults.

&gt;&gt; **The_Penguin_In_A_Zoo** Surprise cat. Oh them cats

&gt;&gt;**CedarWolf** I generally loathe the Downvoting Roman, though, they kind of grow on you, and sometimes they're funny.

&gt;&gt;**GreggoryBasore** Scumbag Steve. The guy looks so lame and irritating

&gt;5 What meme caught you off guard?

&gt;&gt; **brody10123** I was surprised when First World Dog Problems (now First World Cat Problems) ranked as high as it did.

&gt;&gt;**CedarWolf** Every once in a while, there can't be any good new memes, all the big ideas are taken... and then all of a sudden something like Ridiculously Photogenic Guy pops up and takes everything by storm.

If you haven't noticed by now, /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu. 

Let me clarify the history of rage comics once and for all. [Example a](http://i.imgur.com/hF5nG.jpg) In this figure, a user on /b/ who some how accidently stumbles on ""comedy gold"" and created something unique and hilarious. The flower is 4chan's gift to the rest of the internet, the pretty girl. [Example b](http://whynne.deviantart.com/art/Comic-Trolls-98357844?q=gallery%3Awhynne%2F6316811&amp;qo=26) This is the original comic that made troll face. So what have we learned children? 4chan makes everything, thats good boys and girls. When reddit got its hands on rage comics it wasn't an easy transition, alot of bad comics had to be made. But thats just the nature of the beast. And thus good rules were created such as only posting original content. That rule alone is what I believe to be the soul factor in creativity... that and the drug like addict to imaginary numbers known simple as karma.

Enough with the banter, I'll try to put most of their Q&amp;A in the comment section.

&gt;#1. How did you find ""rage comics"". and or how did you become a mod in r/f7u12?

&gt;&gt;**Rswany** I don't really remember specifically how but I was active on different internet communities that got some of their content from 4chan. (UGOPlayer represent! Right GuitarFreak027? haha) I was voted in by the community to be a moderator some time ago.

&gt;&gt;**squatly** Became a mod by asking BritishEnglishPolice (you should all [PM him](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/message/compose?to=BritishEnglishPolice) - he loves getting PMs where people ask him to make them mods). He then interviewed me

&gt;#2. How busy is it most days and in contrast

&gt;&gt;**DoxBox** It's pretty well always busy here. The only difference is if there's some stupid dramatic thing happening, then we have to deal with dozens of mod mails and ""I'm pissed off and making this my soapbox"" comics that need removal. There are other situations, but it all generally leads to more modmail and/or more crap submissions that need removal.

&gt;&gt;**airmandan** It's really, I've found myself beginning to just ignore it completely, which is troublesome for me and I'm trying to actively avoid.

&gt;#3. Has being a mod ever caused you to make a rage comic? Link to it. If not what internal conflicts occurred that the vast userbase have no idea about?

&gt;&gt;**FailCake** [This.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/j7t27/a_word_about_the_spam_filter) It failed miserably.

&gt;&gt;**Rswany** I dunno

&gt;&gt;**Livyka** Yeah

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** I've made ragecomics about modding before, we get some pretty hilarious modmail sometimes. Let's just say that some users take their rage comics very seriously.

&gt;&gt;**Mythrayn** Yes. [Here.](http://i.imgur.com/V5K4C.png) Also [here.](http://i.imgur.com/exkwv.png)

&gt;#4. Has modding a ""Big subreddit"" affected you in anyway? Internally on reddit or externally? How?

&gt;&gt;**DoxBox** Only insofar as I make sure to check here much more often than I did as a regular user. Probably a dozen or so times a day, and to check mod-mail. Takes like 2-3 minutes to deal with your average amount of mod-mail buildup, generally 1-3 posts which are either ""This comic violates the rules."" (and a link to a post which is then checked and removed if necessary) or ""My post got deleted, you guys are terrible, let upvotes decide!"" (To which our response is: Read the rules, there's a very good explanation as to why upvotes are NOT a measure of something belonging in a subreddit.)

&gt;&gt; Sometimes users message us for other reasons; rules suggestions/clarifications, fuck the haters."" type, which always puts a smile on my face.

&gt;&gt; Aside from what I actually do here

&gt;&gt;**RestoreFear** Not at all. Actually

&gt;&gt;**Travis-Touchdown** Seriously, sometimes, but otherwise, it isn't so different.


&gt;#5. Repost a bane to society or a sign that good jokes never die? How has your present no repost policy effected the mod team? What methods do you use to know if a post is a repost or not?

&gt;&gt;**Travis-Touchdown** It depends on the subreddit. I think in smaller communities, and as far as I know there hasn't been any dissent about its presence, which is rare, considering our mod team is pretty large. Generally when we find something is a repost it's with one of two methods. We remember seeing it, ourselves, and find the oriignal, or more prominently the users tell us. Nobody sniffs out a repost like some of the f7u12 userbase

&gt;&gt;**squatly** Bane to society - it gets boring seeing the same thing over and over. I'm pretty sure the mod team all agree on this one. We generally check the comments to see if anyone has complained

&gt;&gt;**RestoreFear** Reposts are not good at all. We want users to share their own content


&gt;#6. Whats your favorite rage face? What makes it so special for you? Whats the one you hate so much? Why do you hate it? 7. What rage face makes no sense or you have no emotional connection with? Why.

&gt;&gt;**airmandan**  My favorite face is the happy forever alone guy with his arms waving in excitement. It's what I do every time I submit something to reddit and it becomes moderately successful. I hate the derp face that everyone and their retarded dog use to make shitty comics about something stupid someone supposedly said to them. Someone in a high school classroom asked a silly question? A christian believes something goofy in the bible? NO SHIT SHERLOCK

&gt;&gt;**DoxBox**I have a new favourite rage face all the time. I think my answer to both questions is going to be the same: Me Gusta. I love that face to death

&gt;&gt;**Rswany** Cereal Guy(the old school one) will always be my favorite

&gt;&gt;**Mythrayn** My favorite rage face is definitely the happy one. I really have no idea

&gt;&gt;**squatly** Favourite face would have to be Me Gusta - it encapsulates the creepy pervert in everyone perfectly! I hate the angry man on the black background, and unfunny 99% of the time.

&gt;#7. If you could mod any one subreddit (not r/f7u12) which would it be? How would you change it from what it is now?

&gt;&gt;**Livyka** I would like to mod [2] /r/askreddit. I wouldn't really change anything

&gt;&gt;**RestoreFear** I would mod [3] /r/reddit.com and reopen it.

&gt;&gt;**toadkiller** I'd like to be a mod on /r/IAmA as I think getting to verify posts with celebrities would be fun. If I had to change it I'd try to end all of the silly drama surrounding Karmanaut. People take the internet too seriously sometimes.

&gt;&gt;**FailCake** I would mod /r/WTF, because I'd probably go overboard.


&gt;#8. Open mic

&gt;&gt;**airmandan**  No, sometimes millions of people in the communities we moderate. We have no idea who you are and we do not care about your life. Moderating on reddit is a shit ton of work that we do on a volunteer basis. I don't demand that you love us or thank us, but if you strike up an attitude because you disagree with a decision one of us made, expect all of us to ignore you in a hurry. There is no reason for us to put up with harassment and abuse from you, no matter how upset you are, so we won't. If you're getting that mad about something on the internet, you should probably go outside.

&gt;&gt;**FailCake** The mods really like it when they get private messages asking questions about the subreddit, Synth3t1c, etc.). They're really nice, give it a shot!

&gt;&gt;**squatly** I have some advice for redditors in general. A lot of people get caught up in the most mundane drama here - just remember you are on a website, and if you are in an argument, you were probably in the wrong).

At first, Mother Nature's attempts to hide the ancient calamity have been in vain.

Whether a coping mechanism for tragedy, just scraped from the bottom of the ocean. 

/r/Shipwrecks continues this interest with new developments, and stories from the waterlogged past. Please, drop in for a salty story or two, of gales, lost schooners, and unforgiving lands. (I mean, you don't *have* to

Anutensil

&gt;What first sparked your interest in shipwrecks?

&gt;&gt;Anu: Probably spending summers on the coast &amp; watching lots of old movies about shipwrecks. There's something timeless, exciting, &amp; ultimately mysterious surrounding a shipwreck.

&gt;&gt;Slap: Aargh

&gt;&gt;CS: I've loved shipwrecks ever since I was little. I remember we had to do a project in fourth grade. It was like the first real project we had ever done. I made this glorious poster board of the Atocha and I made a diagram of a ship with skewers and cloth...it was pretty badass. I even tried to draw some coins.

&gt;What sorts of posts can be found in /r/ShipWrecks?

&gt;&gt;Anu: Mostly

&gt;&gt;Slap: Many fine tales from all over the internets, and posted for karma - fools gold!

&gt;&gt;CS: /r/Shipwrecks has basically everything dealing with ships haha. There's a bit of archaeology

&gt;What is your favorite historical wreck/sinking?

&gt;&gt;Anu: It would have to be the *Titanic*, &amp; provides the most personal &amp; empathetic look at such an experience. Sebastian Junger did an amazing job describing the sinking of the *Andrea Gail*. That one still haunts me. Also, the *Andrea Doria* that went down in 1956. I once tried to call a survivor of that ship. He didn't answer the phone.

&gt;&gt;Slap: [One with the word in a song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnnH-0o2hlE). Not the one you were expecting

&gt;&gt;CS: Right now I'm sort of obsessed with the Vasa. I had no idea what it was until this summer and ever since then I've been fascinated with it. The extent of preservation is just amazing. It's a thing of beauty. If you're not aware of what it it...check it out!

&gt;CravingSunshine

&gt;&gt;CS: Haha, holding his dive knife to the sky and there on it is a little dead fish. He shared his rum with the lot of us. It was a good day.

&gt;Why do you think shipwrecks fascinate people the way they do?

&gt;&gt;Anu: They are like time capsules enveloped in deep mystery tinged with even deeper pathos.

&gt;&gt;Slap: An epic but tragic death upon the merciless sea as one's vessel of work and life goes down, or a figurative one like a landlubber's vehicle or an office tower, the tale of shipwreck demise is profound to the human spirit, as are the ruins and wreckage left behind haunt all who see it.

&gt;&gt;CS: I think it's the fact that water holds many mysteries for humans. For many it holds fear. Shipwrecks are literally time capsules

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/Shipwrecks?

&gt;&gt;Anu: It's great sharing such an interest &amp; I appreciate all.

&gt;&gt;Slap: AAAAAARRRRGH! Submit some stuff

&gt;&gt;CS: You guys are awesome. Every day I learn something new and often times I share it with my archaeologist friends. It's just great.",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/lfw9u/october_18_2011_rshipwrecks_a_history_of_people/

Being at the top of the food chain is a wonderful thing. Not only does it mean we can frolic in the fields without having to worry about a giant eagle or lion coming and snatching us away

/r/TrollingAnimals is for all your silly animal hijinks needs. You want a dog running from a toy crocodile it's dragging? TrollingAnimals has got it. You want a pissed off seagull trying to get to a french fry through a windshield? Motherfuckin' TrollingAnimals has got that

&gt; What's /r/TrollingAnimals all about?
&gt;&gt; **satayjo2**: I'd say it's all in the title. It can be people trolling animals, I'd say, and as far as I know, a concept reddit hasn't really seen yet.
&gt;&gt; **Paulzoom91**: It's a pretty simple concept: If there is trolling with one or more animals involved then it beongs here at TrollingAnimals. Personally

&gt; What are some of your favorites animals trolls
&gt;&gt; **Paulzoom91**: I don't know if I can pick one specifically, birds pooping (thought I hate to be the victim), I mean the possibilities are endless.
&gt;&gt; **DeadOnDrugs**: There's only a couple that I laugh at every time I see (so far at least). There's [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/6Oc50.gif) submitted by dreamerr and then there's [this picture](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o2-8cTRzr6M/ThyA1qlSO1I/AAAAAAAAIGA/Cfz7zVuZnr0/s1600/Hey%2BCat%2B-%2BImma%2BBoop%2BYou%2BHead%2B-%2BBoop.jpg) submitted by our very own PaulZoom91. We found the picture almost a month ago actually

&gt;&gt; Hopefully though

&gt; Has content been flowing steadily since its creation?
&gt;&gt; **DeadOnDrugs**: That's actually a difficult question to answer, and there were a couple other people (read: RichardCraniumIII, GeneralGuyz, and TomZilla11) that posted a couple things each in the first couple days. Things are still slow going, but it seems to be picking up now.
&gt;&gt; **Paulzoom91**: I agree with my fellow mods. We have a huge amount of visits (unique or returning)

&gt; Do you guys do any animal trolling yourselves? A guilty pleasure of mine is to put tape on cats' feet.
&gt;&gt; **Paulzoom91**: Well our [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrollingAnimals/comments/jpidj/so_there_were_some_birds_and_we_had_some_french/) was actually the three of us at a local McDerps. I find it funny when my girlfriend's dog run into their glass door
&gt;&gt; **DeadOnDrugs**: I don't have any pets now, we'd give them some catnip, and then get out the laser pointer. They would run into each other and everything else trying to chase it down. I wish we'd taken a video of it once, but alas, I knew nothing of reddit, and even if I had, I doubt I would have foreseen this subreddit.

&gt;&gt; I'm sure there's others that I've done

&gt; Any final thoughts?

&gt;&gt; **DeadOnDrugs**: I'd just like to point out, and we would really like to keep the subreddit free of it so that everyone can continue to enjoy it.

&gt;&gt; **Paulzoom91**: Agreeing with DeadOnDrugs

We at Subreddit of the Day, very active and growing rapidly!!  Choosing this community was easy - I love subreddits where you can tell mods are working hard to make a good site.  You can tell by the wide range of topics, energetic readers, inclusiveness... r/golf is great.

Let's get this season off right with an interview with angry_caveman_lawyer &amp; his caddy joetroboni.

&gt;Okay r/golf. Compare and contrast your site with other run of the mill glof blogs.

&gt;&gt;r/golf is not a run of the mill golf blog simply because the vast majority of the content is user-driven, the discussion is created and driven by our users. And an interesting thing about the bloggers that do link, they're also active within the subreddit, so it's not like they just submit something and ignore it (for the page views on their site)

&gt;What is the most interesting thing about your community?

&gt;&gt;the most interesting thing about r/golf to me is that we have players who encompass the entire spectrum of golfers. A few of our members are actual PGA professionals (not Tour players, much less 100 rubbing elbows and communicating with players who routinely break par, and that's a pretty neat thing to witness.

&gt;What direction is r/golf moving in?

&gt;&gt;I see r/golf continuing to grow as the US (and, but among the people who frequent our community, most are very passionate about the game. So as people begin to have more disposable income and a passing interest in the game, we'll continue to grow. And hopefully we can help some of those players with a luke-warm interest become more passionate about the game via r/golf.

&gt;How's that golfy moddy thing workin' for ya?

&gt;&gt;being a mod of r/golf is a pretty sweet gig, and of course JT is the man when it comes to CSS related stuff since I'm next to useless when it comes to that. But all in all, our user-base is a good group and there aren't really any issues.

&gt;Tell us about you joetromoni

&gt;&gt;joetromboni is not my real name, but life and work got in the way of my game and I don't play near enough. I have a passion for golf, I know it is something I can do for the rest of my life and enjoy doing it. I know as I get older I'll lose distance and power etc, but I'll still get enjoyment from making some putts and having a good time on the course with good friends. Also I live in Canada so golf is only good may-sep which makes me want to be able to retire to phoenix soon !",,False,self,False,t3_hdvyd

[For the other type of group

I sat down with the moderators of GTM so we can learn more about them and the group they take care of:

&gt;##Why did you start /r/GuessTheMovie? What was the inspiration?

&gt;&gt;**roger_:** Someone started a thread on r/movies a few months before GTM

&gt;##What do you hope to see in the future?

&gt;&gt;**blue_box_disciple:** Our own custom logo

&gt;##What is one of your favorite submissions?

&gt;&gt;**blue_box_disciple:** A few months ago

&gt;&gt;**relic2279:** I don't have a particular favorite

&gt;##What makes for a good submission to /r/GuessTheMovie?

&gt;&gt;**roger_:** A shot that everyone recognizes

&gt;&gt;**relic2279:** I think a good submission is one which isn't too hard and not to easy. One which gets a lot of guesses because the answer is right on the tip of your tongue.

&gt;&gt;**Lynda73:**  As for what makes a great screen shot, it might be something that is instantly recognizable if you have seen the movie. Then again, sometimes it's just a shot you think looks cool. One thing for sure is it's hard to stump our guessers.

&gt;##What has been the most difficult submission to guess so far?

&gt;&gt;**roger_:** Hard to say since most shots are guessed in a couple hours. I did post one that lasted a few months with no correct guesses.

&gt;##Please tell us about you (the mods):

&gt;&gt;**relic2279:** Rather than talk about myself

&gt;&gt;**blue_box_disciple:** I'm the newest mod. I think I've only guessed one shot correctly so far, active group of moderators over here, and I'm glad they asked me to be a part of the team.

&gt;##If you could have one wish for the subreddit

&gt;&gt;**blue_box_disciple:** Hmm... that's hard. We already have a steady flow of traffic and posts

&gt;##Anything else you'd like to mention about /r/GuessTheMovie

&gt;&gt;**blue_box_disciple**: I hope everyone that participates in this competition realizes that they make this subreddit the fun

Ladies and Gentlemen, r/girlsinyogapants, couldn't be with us to present the award.  (Something about this was their busy season).  In their place, SRotD, head goat at Subreddit of the Day will now present the award.

Thank you.  In our line of work, as you'll find out in the interview, it was done not for fortune and glory, but purely for the love of music and the reddit community.

It's an honor for us to feature a fellow subreddit that is dedicated to bringing the awesome. I truly couldn't be happier to feature this subreddit.  And now, here's HarryMuffin and octatone to tell you about r/radioreddit and radioreddit.com.

&gt;Can you give us a quick tl;dr about r/radioreddit?

&gt;&gt;/r/radioreddit is the [reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com) arm and vote tracker for the [radioreddit.com](http://www.radioreddit.com) website and “live” algorithmic stream.  All the music posted to /r/radioreddit is created by redditor musicians and bands.  Voting on songs in our subreddit controls what plays on our live streams and , Last.FM, eclectic college radio, and crowd-sourced DJing.

&gt;How did radioreddit come to be?

&gt;&gt;radio reddit definitely had humble beginnings.  It started as an idea to have a “reddit radio night” filled with redditor music (more specifically it started after a few beers and a “hey..I’ve got an idea”) on an electronic music stream that HarryMuffin ran.  reddit users were able to upload their tracks to a central location, and a large database of music that people could listen to and download.

&gt;&gt;The original reddit posts can be seen [*here*](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/9p9pu/watmm_we_have_an_online_radio_station_for_our/) and [*here*](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9q8sc/tonight_at_7pm_est_is_reddit_radio_night/).

&gt;How old is radioreddit? Please tell us about it's life / history up 'till now.

&gt;&gt;radio reddit started as an event to play a random playlist of music by the musicians of /r/wearethemusicmakers back in late 2009.  And for a long time it remained just that - a completely random mix of music.

&gt;&gt;In 2010 we created the radioreddit.com website to compliment the stream and provide an easy way for musicians to add their music to the stream.  Our website also hosted a forum at that time and archived each hour of the stream and offered it as a podcast download.  We have since retired both of those features.

&gt;&gt;We also started to integrate reddit.com into our stream by creating a permalink system to submit and track votes for songs in our own subreddit /r/radioreddit.  From those votes we started adding weighting to the playlists by making sure songs with above average scores were included every fourth song or so and by excluding songs with scores below -10.  The ages of songs were not considered at this early stage of the algorithm

&gt;&gt;People would check it out

&gt;&gt;So a few months later, and we increased the frequency of above average songs to every other song.  This did two things: it created consistency in the genre of music you would hear, and it increased the number of hivemind selected tracks you would hear.  However, every other song could still be a stinker, and our listeners voiced their concerns.  They also demanded genre specific streams.

&gt;&gt;The first genre specific stream we added was an all electronic stream and it is currently the most popular stream after the main stream.  Soon after, we added a random stream).

&gt;&gt;I think we are in late 2010 in the time line, old rising, new normal, old above average, new rising, old normal.  Normal songs are that which are not above the rising threshold and not below the exclusion threshold.  With this weighting you will always hear new music with classics and you will hear at least two good songs before hearing a song that hasn’t been voted on, or that which you will probably want to downvote.

&gt;&gt;It is now 2011 and we recently launched an iPhone app that interfaces with our stream APIs and reddit’s vote apis to make listening and voting super easy on the go for iOS devices.  We also have a few developers working on Android apps for radio reddit.

&gt;&gt;We are currently working to launch an all talk format stream featuring podcasts and live hosted shows

&gt;&gt;Radio reddit is hands-off and automatic.  We do not determine what songs are played, all of it created by redditors.  A less than stellar song might be played once, but it will soon be removed from the stream by the hivemind.

&gt;Is this a full time job? Does it pay the bills?

&gt;&gt;Nope and nope.  We’re just a couple of musicians with “day jobs” promoting independent music.  Any money we take in is put towards paying our server bills and advertising the site.  We also had a recent set back and are not sure what to do about it: google suspended our AdSense account.  We are as of today relying solely on sponsorships and in-house ads to keep the project alive.

&gt;Anything you'd like to add, someone you'd like to give a firm and friendly punch in the shoulder?

I'm hoping today's Subreddit of the Day will make people very happy.  Today we've got an interview with *honestbleeps*

Look, [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com/) is worth checking out.  You owe it to yourself!  Don't let you down!!

&gt;For those of us who have yet to discover it

&gt;&gt;Reddit Enhancement Suite is a group of tools and enhancements to make browsing Reddit easier and more powerful. It's fully configurable - so if you like some aspects but not others

&gt;&gt;It actually wasn't started with the big wigs at all, but I don't like the idea of essentially making RES an ad-blocker for Reddit - ads are a big part of what keeps Reddit up and running.

&gt;&gt;RES actually started as a few separate modules. I was looking for a way to be a bit more productive with my free time and start coding again (it'd been a while)

&gt;&gt;After churning out 4 or 5 greasemonkey scripts that enhanced Reddit

&gt;&gt;Since then, Safari and Opera... then I added more and more features... now it's getting sort of ridiculous just how much RES can do.

&gt;Thanks! NOW explain r/Enhancement!

&gt;&gt;Well, although it's hard sometimes now that we have a few thousand readers. That makes for a lot of duplicate questions, etc.

&gt;&gt;Still, etc. There are also a number of great participants who help pick up the slack for me and answer questions before I even see them, which is awesome.

&gt;Please tell us about your reddit-life. How involved are you?

&gt;&gt;Well

&gt;&gt;I also moderate /r/hockey and I'm very excited to announce that we're close to having a Reddit hockey jersey manufactured! I can't wait!

&gt;Tell us all about yourself. Is Reddit Enhancement Suite your full-time job or does something else bring home the bacon? What else are you into?

&gt;&gt;Hang on a second while I stop laughing...

&gt;&gt;Okay.. I'm done.. No, sometimes...)

&gt;&gt;My actual job is at an amazing interactive design and technology firm in Chicago called 15 Letters... We create rich interactive content ranging from websites and games to interactive touchscreen kiosks (like multitouch tables

&gt;&gt;It's a stressful but exciting job, etc.

&gt;&gt;Outside of my job and writing RES, so obviously last year was a pretty awesome one for me :-)

&gt;&gt;I also really enjoy poker, and hope to compete in an event or two.

&gt;&gt;Finally

&gt;Give us (1)an opinion you feel strongly about

&gt;&gt;Hm... how about all three?

&gt;&gt;1) A strong opinion of mine: I feel very strongly that people don't consider the Golden Rule enough. Whether it's how we treat each other in real life (yep

&gt;&gt;2) A message to pass along to your kids: Smile and say ""thank you"" or ""have a nice day"" at every opportunity you get - especially to people who are serving you. If someone's bagging your groceries - smile and say ""thanks

Hello loyal reelers! Today I submit to you /r/fishing, but it must be pretty up there. It seems a shame that a subreddit for such a noble sport/profession/hobby has only a few thousand members.

This shouldn't be interpreted as a knock towards the /r/fishing community, and latest news for fishers are all found in. There's even homeless rock fishing, for the truly rustic experience!

The top (and IMO, answered our questions with grace and charm. (Although in all fairness, [sharkfisher](http://www.reddit.com/user/sharkfisher) gets credit for his nomination.)

&gt;What inspired you to create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;It was not long after Reddit implemented subreddits that I had the idea for /r/fishing. I figured most of the more popular topics would be taken up so I sort of went through the list of my favorite hobbies and checked to see which were available. After creating the sub I submitted a couple pages worth of content that I thought would be helpful and also establish the direction I wished it to go. From there I tried promoting it by submitting a link to the general Reddit

&gt;There's quite a bit of variety in /r/fishing? What sort of posts can be found here?

&gt;&gt;As far as variety of posts, natural bait or plastics, newbies seeking advice, or just general news about the sport. But probably mostly it is used to show off our catches. Throughout history, there are hundreds of ways to fish, different reasons that people fish, and different fish to catch, and that is the desire for the fisherman to show off his catch. /r/fishing provides a wide audience to 'ooh' and 'aah' over your skill.

&gt;What's your personal best fishing story?

&gt;&gt;Best fishing story? I can't really pick a best, IEDs, mortar attacks, small arms fire, the works, but the screams and squeals that came out of her when I pulled out a 2 foot gar fish were not natural. She was horrified at this thing and all I could do was sit there and laugh.

&gt;What's your favorite aspect of the community?

&gt;&gt;My favorite part of the community is definitely how willing people are to invite newcomers to the sport. Starting a new hobby can be daunting, I'd have to say that the folks of /r/fishing always keep it civil, actually care about keeping the sub clean, and are just fine folks all around. The moderators TheDrop and speldie23 are always vigilant and keep the place running smoothly. The sidebar is looking great because of them.

&gt;What have you learned from the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;As I said above, and with their advice I certainly have done that.

&gt;Anything to say to the members of /r/fishing?

&gt;&gt;It's a great community, see you out on the water.

See? What a guy. Now it's time for my ultimatum. Get /r/fishing to 3

If someone had told me there was a subreddit for people who were both composers of classical music and redditors, how they would laugh at our expense!

Well like my Uncle used to say, I'm calling you out.  Go ahead and create a phony subreddit, trick me into featuring you guys, make up a bogus interview.  Ha.  Frickin' ha.  Man, I can only imagine your embarassment!  You should see the look on your face!!

&gt;Thanks for the interview bensusername

&gt;&gt;Every post on r/composer contains at least one original composition from a redditor. From there, and suggestions for improvement. Almost all of our posts have feedback and, for that, I'm grateful. We've got a really nice community. The fact that all of our posts have an original composition separates us from r/classicalmusic, where there are pieces from more well-known composers, discussions about their pieces, and other classical-musicky stuff. r/composer is unique in that way. You know exactly what you'll be seeing when you go there.

&gt;I'm trying to figure this out. Redditors

&gt;&gt;To be honest, but a few shameless self-advertisements in other subreddits (such as r/classicalmusic) solved that quickly. :)

&gt;Tell us about the contest!

&gt;&gt;The contest is pretty exciting for everyone. We gave our users one week to come up with a piece for any solo instrument and submit it. Us mods are really happy with the pieces we received. We got 6 pieces for piano, and one piece for clarinet (w/ looping). The talent shown through these submissions is incredible. Right now, we're in the voting process, where redditors can go to [this site](http://availablemusicianslist.wordpress.com/the-first-contest/) and vote for their top three picks. The voting ends this Friday. We'll be announcing the winners on Saturday. The winnders will each receive one month of reddit gold. Oooo ahhh...

&gt;Really cool idea. Now tell us about yourself! Give us the bensusername backstory.

&gt;&gt;As one could assume from my username, and I've been composing since I was 13. A couple months ago, I was accepted into the Interlochen Arts Academy, a boarding high school for the arts in Michigan. I'll be for my junior and senior years of high school as a composition major. Needless to say, I'm pretty damn excited. And that's pretty much me in a nutshell. I've also been a redditor for 6 months.

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;Something that I think is pretty neat at r/composer is our [Available Musicians List](http://availablemusicianslist.wordpress.com/the-list/). As any composer will tell you, myself, am on the list as a clarinetist and pianist. To get on the list, all you have to do is message me with a list of instruments you play. Simple as that.

For those of you who are much older than 16 and have not accomplished anything close to being a classical music composer,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,t3_jtl40

262 Redditors

I've spent a combined several hours at work on break reading the magazines they provide in the break room. Many, and pictures of him doing so really don't belong in anything people can buy.

The Redditor feels like an attempt to bring some respect to a long established joke of journalism. It will be unique (to my knowledge) to publications in that content is almost entirely user created

I spoke with **KILLTHEREDDITOR** about his proposed Internet-themed magazine.

&gt; How did /r/TheRedditor come into being?
&gt;&gt; A few weeks ago I noticed some things about /r/askreddit. More specifically how gossipy the top threads were becoming. ""What's the craziest place you've had sex?"" ""Ladies, and aside from the format itself, I packed in enough reasons to mock reddit. This is front page bait, and sure enough, it hit number one. But before it was posted, I knew exactly what people would say, ""I would read this.""

&gt;&gt; The night before it was posted, sure enough, people were showing interest in a real magazine. OhBlair posted in the thread mentioning we are seriously considering making a magazine format, and dropped a link for the dedicated subreddit simply to spread the word.

&gt;&gt; As the entire project is starting from scratch, people with all sorts of skills offering their help. The wave of interest and support was the inspiration needed to actually move forward and create a proper issue.

&gt; Oh, or saying things the hivemind doesn't like?

&gt;&gt; I'm not really sure. I'm not intentionally trying to start arguments. I've seen some say I am 'trolling, one of the reasons I made this KILLTHEREDDITOR account was because I want these posts to be seen and not get burred like everything else. KILL365 for recreation, KILLTHEREDDITOR for business.

&gt; How will the magazine work

&gt;&gt; As for the structure and content - although we had so many people offering help, what the magazine could do better, and how others could help. If people are interested, we'll continue making these and improving them. If not, the project is dead in the water.

&gt;&gt; As for the release methods.. It is too early to consider payment or true distribution, and the content will easily be viewed on any computer, iPad/tablet/smartphone. A website is currently being built to access past issues and updates.

&gt;&gt;The plan is to release the first issue mid August in a similar way the mock issue was released. Another cover will be posted, we actually made this, download here.' Hopefully it will get some attention on reddit, and everyone can download the magazine, and we can decide where we go from there.

&gt; What kind of content would you publish?

&gt;&gt; Right now we are looking exclusively for original content through the site. Not posts about world news. Not reposts from 4chan. Not editorials or anything generated specifically for the magazine. This could change in the future, photos taken by users, and tips/advice. Consider an AskReddit thread with thousands of posts. We'll go through and find 8 of the most interesting answers, throw them on a page, gloss it up, and you have a nice bit to read.

&gt; How would you like to see The Redditor in the future?

&gt;&gt; I can see people reading this on the train to work, regardless or not if they read the site. It's simply a bunch of unique and interesting stories from real people. So the first challenge is to simply get noticed. Assuming the first steps go well and people are actually enjoying the format, the biggest goal for the future would be true publishing and distribution with Reddit. If this ever becomes a real possibility, it doesn't hurt that Reddit is owned by Condé Nast (a major magazine publisher.) Imagine 99¢/month issues. Helps the magazine, helps the site.

My 5 1/2 year old son experienced his first wasp sting today.  I was busy putting the dishes away when he quietly walked up, and he just stood there before me in total disbelief.  I half-heartedly asked what was wrong, because the time to show affection comes after they move out of the house (or so I've been told).  He had trouble finding the words, but he raised his hand and slowly said, ""I think a bee just bit me.""  And as he said this, he cried these enormous prehistoric blue whale dinosaur tears from out of nowhere!  His little lower lip was reading a 3.2 on the Richter scale and his shoulders were down somewhere just below his bellybutton.  It wasn't the pain of the sting, it was the disbelief that someone or something could be so fucking unkind.

""Come here, I know your hand hurts, but look at this.  There's band promotion, websites, games, even whores!  Okay, there's no whores, unlike Mr. Wasp over there who made you puff up like Pilsbury crescent rolls.  Anaphylaxis?  Such a big word!! Okay

Yes, it's posted well in advance), then there's some fantastic discussion about the featured games!  I'd describe it, but I'll only fuck it up.  Here's creator, ander1dw and mod team member, xtirpation, to give us the full story.  

&gt;Welcome friends

&gt;&gt;ander1dw:  In October 2011

&gt;Can you explain how this place works? How are the games chosen?

&gt;&gt;ander1dw:  Every month, and the schedule is then set weeks in advance to give everyone a chance to acquire and play the games ahead of time. To include as many people as possible, each set of discussions is broken down into the following categories:
 
&gt;&gt;- **2 PC games** (1 past
&gt;&gt;- **1 console game** (any era)
&gt;&gt;- **1 handheld game** (any era)
&gt;&gt;- **1 traditional game** (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameSociety/comments/qg9vk/announcement_rgamesociety_is_adding_a_new/) for details)

&gt;&gt;xtirpation:  Twice a month, people can just drop by if a listed game catches their attention. Personally I'd like for everyone to at least try one of the games from each set that we list, but of course it's understandable if they don't. As far as the selection guidelines go, when the subreddit was created we wanted to make sure everyone can participate at least a little bit. That means every platform had to be allowed. As well, we wanted to make sure that people didn't have to buy a new game every two weeks to participate in our discussions, so we added the ""past-era PC game"" as a staple to our mix, because they're usually cheap and accessible even if our users don't have it already. Most of these rules were created with user input in the beginning.

&gt;Is a book club a fair analogy? If not

&gt;&gt;ander1dw:  I think the book club analogy is very fair. In fact

&gt;So

&gt;&gt;xtirpation:  Like I said earlier, that's fine too. To be perfectly honest, there's no way we would know if the copy of the game a user played was pirated either, but of course I would prefer if the developers got some support for the work that they do.

&gt;&gt;ander1dw:  Absolutely not. In fact, have one of the systems with which to play them.

&gt;Tell us about the discussions. What would we find in your well used

&gt;&gt;xtirpation:  In short, story, or any other facet of the gaming experience.

&gt;&gt;ander1dw:  Comments range from people reflecting on their likes and dislikes of the game, to delving into [""ludological""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ludology) topics like overarching themes, narrative and design.

&gt;Last one - please tell us why we should be excited about [/r/GameSociety](/r/GameSociety).

&gt;&gt;ander1dw:  In my opinion, their friends stopped playing, etc. And regardless of whether or not you intend to follow the schedule, you will be hard-pressed to a find a better forum for discussions of specific games (both old and new) than [/r/GameSociety](/r/GameSociety).

&gt;&gt;xtirpation:  What makes /r/GameSociety exciting for me is that there's often not many people in real life to have discussions about games with. I find that a lot of the time my friends and I hold similar opinions about games. It really doesn't help stir up interesting discussion. As well

Ever since I read [this week's challenge](http://redd.it/l6cjw) on [Project Reddit](/r/projectreddit), (with my most favourite bucket), I got around to installing curtains (newspapers &amp; foil), and I found that corrective helmet my daughter was supposed to wear as a baby to correct her misshaped head.  She's 13 now &amp; starting to show interest in the lads... let's hope they like chicks in helmets!

I can't describe the elation, ""I did that.  Me,"" and not hearing sirens, smoke alarms or children crying in the distance... well that's the meaning of life right there.  I can only imagine this is how it feels for community members of today's Subreddit of the Day, *edmproduction*.   Creators, artisans, builders, the production of syncopated construction site noises, now there are sirens.  These friends make and critique electronic dance music all day long!  They have a good amount of readers, and very active

Here to explain /r/edmproduction is *i_lyke_money*.  I'm very appreciative of this great redditor's efforts and the time they took to participate in our interview.  Thanks!

**edit**:  a good portion of today's interview was also provided by *mwd410*.  I failed to mention him in the initial write up 'cause he told my sister he'd call her

&gt;Please describe /r/edmproduction. Please describe it to me in such detail that even I would understand what the hell's going on there.

&gt;&gt;'edmproduction' is short for Electronic Dance Music Production. Electronic Dance Music (commonly written as 'EDM') is a term that covers a very wide range of genres. As a definition, Trance and Drum n' Bass. [Wikipedia has an extensive list of all the genres that are considered to fall under the definition of Electronic Dance Music.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electronic_music_genres)

&gt;&gt;As for our subreddit

&gt;&gt;1.  The creation of a sound. The most common tools used to do this include synthesizers

&gt;&gt;2.  The processing of these sounds. To make the sounds we created sound better or more unique, darker etc.), compressors (to change the volume of a sound over time), reverb and distortion (most commonly used on guitars).

&gt;&gt;Nearly all of this work is done in what we call a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). A DAW is an interface that runs on a computer and allows you to sequence sounds over a timeline to create a track. Some of the most common DAWs used can be found above the search bar on our frontpage.

&gt;&gt;As a whole, and help each other improve their skill in the production of EDM. It is an open ended discussion and newbies and experts alike are welcome to join us.

&gt;Typically

&gt;&gt;There is a range

&gt;&gt;-Feedback threads

&gt;&gt;-Links to tutorials on the web or tutorials made by the community on a specific aspect of production.

&gt;&gt;-Discussion about new products/software coming out.

&gt;&gt;-Motivational threads. As with any type of music, and can take a long time to master or create something that others would want to listen to. To combat producers from becoming discouraged, community members have posted videos and text write ups to motivate people to stick with it through the times when you're unable to produce anything of value.

&gt;How's it going at /r/edmproduction? Everything cool? Anything exciting going on these days?

&gt;&gt;There's a lot of new and exciting things happening at r/edmproduction. Within the last day or two we added flair icons that users can hover over to see a link to that users Soundcloud page. A Soundcloud page is like a resume for music producers where you can post your music and people can comment, and other ideas that are in the works. The community is growing rapidly and we're excited about the direction it's headed.

&gt;What about the weekly production logs?  Please explain how this works.

&gt;&gt;mwd410 (the subreddit creator) came up with the idea of creating a program called ""The Weekly Track"" which is an open sign up deal. Those who sign up get a little tag next to their name indicating that they are a ""Weekly Tracker"" participant. Every week on Monday morning, even wrote a program to create the table automatically which is a huge time saver for us moderators.

&gt;&gt;The purpose of the weekly tracker log is to create a small motivation for people to push themselves to create music often. My hope is that those who have the tag next to their name are respected members of the community

&gt;3 things you like about /r/edmproduction

&gt;&gt;Things that we like about the community:

&gt;&gt;-We've tried to create a sense in the community that it belongs to the members

&gt;&gt;-We feel like people really enjoy helping others and listening to ideas from others.

&gt;&gt;-We love the passion that everyone has for EDM. I think we would all be really good friends if we were ever to meet in real life.

He's got everything he needs though, a good taste in music, an internet connection, a positive attitude, limited resources... oh why don't I just let Sid interview the man for you.

After you meet olkensey

&gt;What first inspired you to make your own home?

&gt;&gt;I've always found a certain joy in solving problems by using the stuff I already have. When I first heard about Earthships, tools, and skills. I'm a minimalist by nature so the simplicity of the design appealed to me.

&gt;&gt;Also

&gt;What has been the biggest challenge so far?

&gt;&gt;Making myself get out there (almost) everyday. There's so much to do that it can be difficult to motivate especially since some days show no real significant signs of progress except for a few feet has dirt has been moved out of the way (or into a tire).

&gt;&gt;That and being horribly out of shape. I'd spent too much of this year sitting around being sad which somehow didn't develop the muscles I needed to do hours of shoveling. (But I could airblast like a madman! Did they ever fix the Detonator to allow proper Pyro rocketjumping? TF2

&gt;What's the most important thing you've learned from this project?

&gt;&gt;Just lots of little things, rocks are heavy. Wherever you leave the wheelbarrow is where you'll be moving it from once it's full.

&gt;What's been your most fulfilling moment so far?

&gt;&gt;Hurting myself

&gt;Could you elaborate on the ""secret future plans"" you've mentioned?

&gt;&gt;The previous owner used to have festivals here. The hole that I'm building around was originally a ""dump hole"" for all the trees that were excavated to create space for parking

&gt;&gt;Also

&gt;What advice would you have for someone who would like to go out and build something similar?

&gt;&gt;Do it. Find a balance between crazy ideas and what you can actually get done and do it. You can move a mountain if you have the time and will to do so. Drink water and push yourself-- but be sure to listen to your body as you go. Muscles take 48 hours to grow and heal

&gt;Is there anything you would like to say to the subscribers of /r/vstheearthship?

Some of you may remember a certain [AskReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/irjyo/why_dont_we_have_a_reddit_worldwide_day_of/) post about a week ago calling for a worldwide day of volunteering

A duty was thrust upon **djspacebunny** after posting what was likely a passing thought, and I feel the need to spread the word around.

&gt; So
&gt;&gt;We're a group of redditors meeting together to discuss how we can help in our communities and beyond. The point is to make it as easy as possible to find a way to help. Some options don't even require you to put on pants.

&gt;What are some examples of the activities users will be contributing to?
&gt;&gt;I don't think we have examples yet. Each city/area is trying to plan an outing of some sort or at least get together to DO something helpful. I know the site admins want to tie helpit into their college campaign this summer

&gt;What made you decide to start /r/Helpit?
&gt;&gt;The other night

&gt;How receptive has the community been to your efforts? Did interest seem to die off pretty fast as the /r/AskReddit post faded from memory?
&gt;&gt;Most people have been surprisingly receptive to the idea. The original r/askreddit post had a few trolls but hey
We saw a pretty steady stream of new folks over the course of the first two days. Something like 1200 new subscribers in 24 hours. The initial survey has over 1000 responses from all over the world! Since hueypriest posted the r/helpit ad

We're always on the lookout for subreddits that are not only unique but that
we feel contribute something to reddit and the community as a whole. Today's
subreddit of the days is definitely one of those.

Picture Challenge puts the photographers of reddit to work every week with
a different them or constraint
the chance of choosing the next topic).

The results are often truly incredible. This is definitely one of those subreddits that 
needs to be on your front page
are looking for a new desktop wallpaper or are looking for a bit of inspiration.
But don't just take my word for it
a quick chat about /r/PictureChallenge:

&gt; Congratulations on being featured for today's Subreddit of the Day!
&gt;&gt; I never expected this. I am truly humbled. /r/PictureChallenge has steadily grown since it was created 8 months ago. It's required much work but it has been worth it to see everyone having a good time.

&gt; /r/PictureChallange is quite a unique subreddit. For those that aren't familiar
&gt;&gt; PictureChallenge is a place for photographers who are looking for ideas or for some focused concepts to have some fun and show everyone what they can do. The winners get to pick upcoming challenges and everyone else has to interpret them in their own way. Whichever picture everyone thinks best represents the challenge wins

&gt; What's the one thing budding photographers should know before entering into a picture challenge?
&gt;&gt; It never hurts to try. The old saying ""practice makes perfect"" is nothing but true when it comes to photography. You never know when you might get the perfect picture and you can always learn from your mistakes. If I were to give a tl;dr

&gt; Not only are the photographs super creative and inspiring
&gt;&gt; Oh, as you say, a bit of creativity and inspiration.

&gt; The most recent picture challenge
&gt;&gt; So I have to give a plug to my new favorite redditor here

&gt; I'd just like to say thank you guys for taking part
&gt;&gt; I really would like to give a shout out to all of the wonderful redditors who participate every week and make PictureChallenge so much fun to work on. You all make this fun and worth the effort. And I can't leave out my co-mods. Very little would get done without your help. To everyone else,,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,True

I was checking out one of my favourite dumpsters a month ago (looking for Narnia), aaah!  Then I was like, grrr!  It only took me a second to go from elation to protective, covetous koala.  Believe me, those buggers do NOT share!

I took the new-to-me guitar home, I can't communicate sadness in animal noises.  There must've been some dreams thrown away with that guitar.   I started to think of the stories that guitar could tell.  Someone bought it with intentions of learning, someone got it as a gift from a loved one, someone stole it from Guitar Center or the back of a Hyundai... The point is, that guitar belonged with someone who had dreams but no guitar.  I bundled it back up and put it back outside the dumpster knowing that in about 10 minutes, someone would walk by and say, ""Man

r/guitarlessons exists for the simple purpose of bringing guitar instruction to redditors.  This community is very supportive and encouraging.   Sure, give feedback and point you in the right direction.  I realize that learning guitar might not be on everyone's radar, but I chose this sub based on the overlying theme of helping others / educating.  I could tell you more about this great site, but let's have cbg, co-mod at r/guitarlessons tell you about it!

&gt;Please describe r/guitarlessons.

&gt;&gt;I think it's summed up by the first bit of description in the sidebar: ""A place for redditors to teach redditors..."". /r/guitarlessons spun off from /r/guitar, too, but there were enough posts there about lessons and technique that creation of /r/guitarlessons was warranted.

&gt;&gt;Currently, /r/watmm, /r/mitm, etc. too.

&gt;What level of guitar player do you cater to? What style?

&gt;&gt;I think we have players of all levels of ability. If I had to guess

&gt;Thinking of r/guitarlessons

&gt;&gt;Really

&gt;If you could change one thing about your site

&gt;&gt;I said we're heavy on beginners... on that note: I think we would benefit from figuring out a better way to answer ""beginner FAQs"". There are two good posts in the side bar about beginner advice and tips

&gt;&gt;I've been thinking it would be cool to implement some sort of grading system so that people could indicate what playing ability a lesson was aimed at (e.g., advanced), but I haven't brought that up with the other mods before. It would be nice if people could browse lessons and quickly see which ones were about the right level for them and/or search/filter on lesson level.

&gt;Your turn. Anyone you'd like to acknowledge or thank?

&gt;&gt;Those that deserve the most thanks are the members of the /r/guitarlessons community. They make it what it is. o7i3 deserves much credit for seeing the need for this subreddit and making it go. irishcocacola does a nice job here

You've seen furniture porn before (I'm not the only one who looks at that, going through life without questioning things.


Well, not porn (that word is so confusing now) - just fine craftsmen perfecting their crafts and showing how to do it.  

I sat down with TechnoL33T and tref a few months ago (sorry guys - this had been lost in our archives) with this interview:
    
&gt;##Why did you start /r/ArtisanVideos? What was the inspiration?
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**: Ok

&gt;&gt;**Tref**: I joined ArtisanVideos almost as soon as it was created

&gt;##What do you hope to see in the future?
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**:  I want to see fat stacks of cash pressed together to form the bricks of the house I live in. For the subreddit, you should find videos like this. 

&gt;&gt;**Tref**: I would like to see more redditor submissions

&gt;##What is one of your favorite craft videos?
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**:  My all time favorite video would have to be this one. The sheer ridiculous amount of detail and ability this man shows is amazing. It's in 2 parts

&gt;&gt;**Tref**:  
I don't have a favorite per say. I was always mesmerized by skilled craftsmanship - regardless of the nature. There is a trend that affects popularity though: videos depicting someone very quick and very acrobatic about the craft are always highly rated. Also

&gt;##What craft would you absolutely love to see a video of?
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**:  I'm not exactly sure what craft I would pick if I could. Part of what draws me to this theme is that it's very abstract, or simplistic, but detailed and made with good materials. 

&gt;&gt;**Tref**: I really would like to see certain submissions

&gt;##What type of crafts are typically shown?
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**:  Most of the crafts I see posted here are people making something by hand

&gt;&gt;**Tref**: Typical crafts as I have mentioned are the ones that are quick to produce a result (sub 5 minute videos)

&gt;##Have any redditors submitted their own crafts
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**: I don't remember seeing any posts actually made by a redditor yet

&gt;&gt;**Tref:** I haven't seen any reddit created videos yet

&gt;##Please tell us about you (the mods)
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**: About me... haha, I have very pointed opinions that I strongly believe in. I take a lot of passion in all of my 'hobbies' and I don't like to do anything half-way. I'm a technotarian. 

&gt;##Anything else you'd like to mention about /r/ArtisanVideos
&gt;&gt;**TechnoL33T**:  I'd like to add that only the really awesome people have what it takes to survive the horrible terrible place that is r/ArtisanVideos

A small stick of sunscreen

Four USB flash drives

A gold 2 carat diamond engage-e-ment ring

I pulled out a note that said

If it fits up my ass

Possibly the greatest thing about working on Subreddit of the Day is that often you meet the most amazing people.  *Yobgal*, he performs magic, aaand is some grand wizard in the world of marching bands.  It's like the guy never let go of his 10 year old self!  I'm sure in his spare time he builds kick ass forts and communicates strictly through walkie talkie.

I chose to feature r/magic because it's a great place - lot's of interesting posts discussing the fine art of magic.  If anything

&gt;Welcome to Subreddit of the Day

&gt;&gt;I've been studying magic for about 20 years. I started actually working about ten years ago on a very part-time basis

&gt;Please explain your subreddit to us - what will we find there?

&gt;&gt;You'll find a pretty wide variety of anything that has to do with magic. Performance videos, links to things that magicians would find funny, etc.

&gt;Tell us about the typical posts. Please elaborate on how ""exposure of performance secrets"" is frowned upon.

&gt;&gt;Typical posts are anything involved with magic (as above). Exposure is a tougher subject that would require many pages and an in-depth discussion to cover. An incomplete explanation is that exposure can hurt magic, if somebody were to spend a few days delving through registry at the patent office to discover the secret behind a brilliant illusion that David Copperfield's team spent a long time to invent and perfect, then publish a link that explains everything...well, that's less okay in my opinion.

&gt;&gt;A final thought on how ""exposure of secrets is frowned upon"" - Exposure can be a vehicle to inspire creativity. Some people must create new work, comments and posts that serve no purpose other than to essentially say, ""lol heres the secrets"" have a decent chance of being removed. I try to moderate with a copyright in mind. While an act can't really be copyrighted, there's a sort of ""gentleman's agreement"" amongst many magicians that you won't use other people's work without permission. After all, they're the ones who worked to develop it. If somebody were to post a detailed (and likely correct) exposure of a current performer's personally developed, modern work, that comment will be removed without hesitation.

&gt;Do you have typical discussions and if so

&gt;&gt;It's a subreddit about magic, and there are a few ""lolz i has a kitty"" type of comments. I think that the notable difference is that Arrested Development/Gob jokes don't go over as well in r/magic as they do anywhere else on reddit.

&gt;What is the future of magic. Is there growth or are we witnessing a decline?

&gt;&gt;This is the real reason I answered this immediately. Magic is in a HUGE boom of growth right now. There are several websites that cater to teenagers who just want to learn one or two cool things to show their friends (or strangers), Jeff Sheridan, Cellini, and Kozmo.

&gt;&gt;Not only is it becoming easier to start in magic, I'm really excited about the last couple of years and the direction of magic as an art today.

&gt;&gt;Due to the huge amount of interest in learning about magic,,False,self,t5_2sgno,False,,True

I was going crazy trying to think of something wacky to introduce today's Subreddit of the Day.  I was planning on doing a whole Whitney Houston thing (since she's had the greatest impact on my life), if you're wondering when the true part of the story comes out, it's right here!  So.  There I am in South Chicago in a first grade classroom, trying as hard as I could to do the right thing.  It was tough, I saw some crazy things, but I had this one phrase that solved many a dispute... ""sharing is caring and giving is living.""

Jump forward another bunch years and now I'm a dad of two kids who I'm proudly co-raising (me and Jesus).  Not much has changed, ""what's the most important thing in the world?""  To which they reply, ""to be nice!""  And then I make a real tight fist near my face and say, ""Yer goddamn right it is!!"" and take a half step towards them to see if they flinch.  Who says parenting is tough?

So while it's true that words can make a difference, [r/Food_Pantry](http://www.reddit.com/r/food_pantry).  They have every reason to celebrate and be celebrated.  They're a living, breathing, honest to goodness embodiment of *sharing is caring, giving is living, and being nice is the most important thing in the world.*   Here to describe r/Food_Pantry and further explain the greatest love of all is head mod and creator, redditnoobie!

&gt;&gt;Oh WOW!!! This is quite the honor! Thanks guys!

&gt;&gt;Excuse me if my answers are written peculiarly

&gt;&gt;Okay

&gt;Alright

&gt;&gt;R/Food_Pantry is a charitable subreddit where redditors may come and request or donate food, pet food, really anything they need to live comfortably without the guilt of asking for too much or paying back the original gifter. Here, you simply ask for what you need, and pay it forward when you can.

&gt;&gt;It's a simple concept that is really changing lives. This subreddit has only been active for a month and here we are, and a subreddit of the day later... I couldn't be happier with the outcome of this subreddit.

&gt;&gt;Honestly

&gt;I'd love to know how this subreddit started a month ago. How'd you get such a big-wig mod dream team?

&gt;&gt;Well, maybe it's not all that odd... we were having to wait a week for his paycheck and ran out of money for food. I asked for two pizzas on [RAOP](http://www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza) (an AMAZING subreddit!), one for that day and then one for the next). I felt so bad about asking for two pizzas but people understood. And I realized, it's okay to ask for help.

&gt;&gt;The next day I ran into my favorite customer (a lady who resembles the grandmother from Raising Hope with the most radiant personality you'd ever meet!) at a local general store with at least twenty packages of toilet paper, naturally, asked her why she had such an abundance of toiletries and she explained that she worked at a local food pantry where once a month they give out one brownbag package to families who sign up. Times are so bad, and the need for help is so great, that people, in our community, are only getting help once a month. Now, it's food and toilet paper for a week

&gt;&gt;That's when I thought of r/food_pantry. If someone can get a pizza for the night from someone across the world


&gt;&gt;So, bless his heart, answered every dumb question I can throw at him ^_^

&gt;&gt;I knew I wanted to improve the aesthetic view of the site, I wasn't looking for but one more addition to the mod group, and it's the best damn decision I've made to add these four awesome fuckers to the group ^_^ I just couldn't ask for a better team.

&gt;I'm curious, how?

&gt;&gt;Trolls and spammers are always going to be lurking around charitable subreddits. It's sad, but in the end it really comes back on the reader to do what they think is best. If someone has a shady posting history, DON'T GIVE to them. If someone is rude, demanding, or refuses to give documentation you ARE NOT OBLIGATED to give them your money or help them in any way.

&gt;What's working with your service? What needs improving? How can we help?

&gt;&gt;The subreddit is new

&gt;Final question: tell us about your recipients and providers.

&gt;&gt;This is an extreme understatement, and I'm sure the recipients would agree, are nothing sort of heroes to these people. They make a grim situation bright and there is nothing more uplifting than that.

&gt;Your turn

&gt;&gt;**THANK YOU GUYS!!!** The amount of support has been truly inspirational. I honestly can't wait to see what the future holds for our little piece of the web! May you live long and prosper &lt;3 Reddit wouldn't be reddit without people like you! Thank you!

Today we bring you a follow up to yesterday's rage theme.  To explain his latest creation is *syncretic*, for tomorrow is another day!

&gt;What drove you to create r6a10? What's the reason you created this one

&gt;&gt;I created a6theism10 for two reasons. Let me preface this by saying that I like rage comics. Obviously someone who does not like rage comics has no business running a subreddit about rage comics. I also love /r/atheism. Actually

&gt;&gt;I ultimately hope this subreddit will resemble the origin of f7u12 itself, but I don't like reading them every day, and I don't like seeing them on the front page of /r/atheism every day. I would like to choose when I am able to see them, and I felt that the best way to do that was to create a subreddit that focused exclusively on them.

&gt;&gt;Before f7u12 was created, and users flocked there, little by little at first, and then in droves. I hope to mirror that on a smaller scale.

&gt;&gt;The second reason I created this subreddit was so that every atheism-related comic would have a chance to flourish and reach its' intended audience, so users want to submit there instead of the larger, broader subreddit.

&gt;Please tell me what motivates you.

&gt;&gt; I haven't really thought about this until now, and I also saw a lot of complaining about it (and I was doing some of the complaining), so it stuck me as an opportunity, and an experiment of sorts. This subreddit may flourish into what I had originally envisioned, or it may just serve as an archive of rage comics submitted to /r/atheism. Only time will tell.

&gt;What is your philosophy of reddit?

&gt;&gt;I have a very liberal philosophy of Reddit, so I am exposed to the opinions of others who are also concerned about the future of Reddit, many of whom are ""power users"" and a driving force in the community.

&gt;&gt;What really draws me to Reddit is that it is a great equalizer. When you're having a conversation here, a scientist, a teacher, a politician, or an unemployed housewife. You have no idea what race, color or creed they are, unless they tell you. All you have to work with is their ideas, their thoughts that they choose to share with you. It cuts out a lot of the prejudices and the bullshit that comes with interactions in real life.

&gt;&gt;I love it here. If I didn't I wouldn't spend so much of my free time endlessly clicking links and replying to comments.

Thanks Mr. Syncretic.  By the way,,False,self,t5_2sgno,True,,True

&gt; Congratulations on being todays Subreddit of the Day, if you'll excuse the term!
&gt;&gt; Thanks for choosing us as the subreddit of the day! Great sky-pornos should capture the sky (including clouds, etc.) in a beautiful, almost imaginary way.

&gt; How did /r/SkyPorn come about?
&gt;&gt; I've always been fascinated with the sky, but not so many pictures of what is right above us, so I created /r/SkyPorn in an attempt to change that.

&gt; A lot of the other similar communities (CityPorn
&gt;&gt; Since /r/SkyPorn isn't an ""official"" /r/EarthPorn sister subreddit (yet)

&gt; As we all know, with /r/politics being on one end, and /r/truereddit being on the other!)

Cover songs are the macaroni and cheese of the music world.  And everyone loves macaroni and cheese!  They're the warm hug from an old friend, that jellybean behind the couch that no one sees you eat.  You know you're either going to love it or totally hate it, but at least you can feel comfortable knowing your feelings are honest and justified.  

Let's look at some cover songs, I already like it.  See how this works?  Cover songs are just that great.  You think, ""are they going to play it exactly like the original?  Man that takes talent to pull that off OR Wow, what an interesting take on that song!""   

This is why I love r/coversongs.  They bring the awesome by the bucket load.  It's a really active community, obscure submissions, and back pages to really sink your ears into.  Spend 1 minute browsing posts and BAM!  There goes an hour.  Who knows, you may find your wedding song or funeral song here!  I sincerely you enjoy r/coversongs as much as I do.  And now, No-Shit-Sherlock, creator and moderator of r/coversongs!!

&gt;How does r/coversongs work? What makes an acceptable submission?

&gt;&gt;The sidebar says it all. ""For lovers of musical reimagination... remixes

&gt;How did your subreddit start?

&gt;&gt;I am obsessed with coversongs and was disappointed by how infrequently they were submitted to /r/music &amp; /r/listentothis so I wanted to start a community dedicated to them. The first few weeks I was all alone and submitting most of the content myself from my giant list of favorited coversongs on youtube but it steadily gained subscribers and regular submitters as I promoted it more and more. Killbrad was the first mod to join and was also a major contributor at the time. I couldn't have done it without his help. doug3465 just joined us recently but has already made us a new header image and has lot of enthusiasm. /r/coversongs has grown by leaps and bounds and I no longer have to go around promoting it which is great because promotion always made me uncomfortable. I was always careful to make the promotion submissions/comments appropriate and not SPAM-y but I still disliked doing it.

&gt;How much stuff is created by redditors? Any success stories?

&gt;&gt;A lot less than I would like

&gt;What's your favourite thing about r/coversongs?

&gt;&gt;For me

&gt;If you could change one thing about your site

&gt;&gt;I am a professional web developer and I really want to set up a custom domain for /r/coversongs and skin the subreddit to match. I also want to set up something like /r/listentothis's http://www.redditunes.com/ but I just haven't managed to find the time. Alas my workload has been steadily increasing so I don't foresee it happening anytime soon but it's definitely a goal I want to accomplish.

Today's Subreddit of the Day covers a scope beyond my wildest imagination.   r/law covers legal issues in the media, I mean, they talk about everything!  Now, that's more than enough if you're thinking regionally - consider legal matters on a global scale!  I'm getting woozy just imagining where this could go!  So here's why you *would* want to go to r/law.  It's a pretty active community with great discussions.  Best of all, these are very nice people in a world so bitter, so jaded.  Yes good people doing the Lord's work.  Are you an attorney? Law student? Recidivist?  Looking for nude pics of Sam Waterston or Jerry Orbach?  Get over to r/law!

But who will explain all this legal mumbo-jumbo?  Enter [JoshTheGoat](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Law_And_Order_theme.ogg)

Take us to your legal paradise

&gt;Please tell us all about yourself.

&gt;&gt;I’m a recent graduate from the University of Houston Law Center and I'm currently studying for the Texas Bar Exam. I have two daughters

&gt;&gt;I became the mod of /r/law soon after joining reddit 3 years ago, got put on as mod, and since then we’ve grown from a few hundred members to over 7,500 members. Although two other mods are listed in the subreddit as being senior to myself, they haven't actually exercised their mod power once in the past 3 years that I'm aware of.

&gt;&gt;I spend most of my time on reddit bouncing between [law](http://reddit.com/r/law), [minecraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft), [game of thrones](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones), [doctor who](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho), [daddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit), [Parenting](http://www.reddit.com/r/parenting), [Frugal](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugal), [Reddit Gifts](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgifts)

&gt;I want to know about the spectrum that r/law covers. You've got news articles about legal stuff

&gt;&gt;/r/law really applies to anything and everything that may have a legal relevance. This results in a significant overlap with several other subreddits such as politics, but everything is welcome. However, we tend to encourage people to leave out their editorial opinions in headlines when citing to case opinions or political developments, which is better suited for /r/politics.

&gt;&gt;The only thing that really doesn't belong are questions from people truly seeking legal help. There’s a plethora of reasons why a lawyer can’t give legal advice to anonymous people online

&gt;&gt;For people that have no idea where to turn when facing a legal situation we recommend two solutions. Head over to the American Bar Association's website for [""When you Need a Lawyer""](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_issues_for_consumers/needlawyer.html) for a series of articles on how to find an attorney or when to hire an attorney. For people that don't have the resources to hire an attorney we've created a list of non-profit legal assistance in various states on our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Law#LegalAid). However

&gt;""... discuss new and interesting legal developments from around the world."" Since law pertains to geographic or political regions

&gt;&gt;/r/law has a heavy focus on U.S. law

&gt;Tell us about your community members &amp; typical discussions.

&gt;&gt;The vast majority of our users are U.S. attorneys, issues facing law schools or the legal career, and of course people asking for legal advice despite the fact that we can't answer their question.

&gt;I can imagine moderating this subreddit can be challenging and time consuming. What's it like as a mod of r/law?

&gt;&gt;The moderators have taken a rather laissez-faire approach to the subreddit. We only remove spam from the subreddit. So even if people still ask for legal advice

It gives me immense pleasure to present to you one of the greatest interviews we've ever had.  We at Subreddit of the Day proudly present an evening with NoMoreNicksLeft

Mwa.  Ah.  Ah.

&gt;Please describe r/collapse to the uninitiated.

&gt;&gt;r/collapse is a place to discuss the concept of collapse of civilization. Though the initial stages may resemble a disaster, human beings will still exist.

&gt;&gt;The concept of collapse posits that there are certain calamities that will change human civilization entirely. For instance: Were our planet to suffer another misfortune like the Carrington Event, the remaining petroleum is too deep for more primitive rigs.

&gt;&gt;And that particular type of event is far from impossible... scientists suspect that they happen once or twice every thousand years.

&gt;&gt;More disturbing is the thought that this could happen even without a dramatic catalyzing event. If it's true once technological civilization suffers a hiccup we cannot hope to start it a second time

&gt;How did this community get off the ground? What keeps it afloat?

&gt;&gt;I searched for a subreddit like this in late 2007 or so, and Great_Pumpkin was made a moderator. Maybe a year or so later I was invited to be a moderator while Escafane went on sabbatical.

&gt;&gt;There initially, often with good reason. The Dow might be back in the 12,000 range, and those who can invest may be living the good life... but for the rest of us, for typical people just trying to get along, things are pretty bad right now. The media has moved on to Charlie Sheen and royal weddings and the like, but all those foreclosures didn't disappear.

&gt;&gt;And it's not simply economic problems either. Every year there are more mouths to feed

&gt;I'm just going to say it

&gt;&gt;No. It'd be difficult to discuss the subject in a gleeful tone.

&gt;Any thoughts on the May 21st end of days declaration?

&gt;&gt;I'm an atheist. It's absurd to me. Humans don't need Jeebus to create a doomsday

&gt;I'm so glad you both could join us. I'm pretty excited about tonight's pick. I'm a fan of both Katy's music and her looks

&gt;Could you please tell us a little bit about yourselves?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:** I'm a high school student entering senior year this fall, I'm a gamer who plays games on Steam (mainly TF2), Pokemon, and classic N64 games. I have done some coding (mainly in PHP and a little Java/Python) in the past, but I haven't done much in that regard lately. My offline social circle has expanded from nothing in the past year and a half, primarily from finally finding people with a great amount of common interests.

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez:** Eh

&gt;How exactly did r/KatyPerry get started?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:**I started my first subreddit, so I created it, not thinking it would be very populated. The earliest readers, including violentacrez, discovered the subreddit by typing in the subreddit to see if it exists.

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez:** Foltaggio started it

&gt;What sets you apart from other subreddits?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:** Well

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez:** I'd have to say... Katy Perry.


&gt;OK

&gt;Do either of you have a favorite submission thus far?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:** There hasn't been many submissions

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez:** No. I love them all.

&gt;What's your favorite Katy Perry song?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:** My all time favorite Katy Perry song is [Thinking of You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdGZBRAwW74). It's a sweet song that is quite different than some of her other songs. Now

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez:** Well

&gt;Any interesting stories you'd like to share?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:** One of my internet friends is several orders of magnitude more obsessed with her than I am, it got quite a bit of attention in a lot of blogs, including entries on the MTV and Time blogs. It's a pretty interesting way to get your 15 minutes of fame. I'm never been even close to as obsessive or creepy with my love for her as he is, but it's become a joke with some of my internet friends.

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez:** Not so much.

&gt;What would you like the future to hold for /r/KatyPerry?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:** I'm expecting the subreddit to grow slowly and eventually expand to featuring more posts that are not just a bunch of pics. The subreddit sometimes gets a small amount of growth when she's mentioned elsewhere on reddit.

&gt;&gt;**violentacrez:** More readers

&gt;Is there anything else you'd like to say to our audience?

&gt;&gt;**foltaggio:** I know most of reddit likes her boobs, from slight interest to obsessive periods. Currently, I wouldn't say I'm obsessive (relatively), but I am interested in any pics and media that come to me (as opposed to searching for it myself). Anyway, I'm surprised that this subreddit was nominated for Subreddit of the Day, considering it is mainly just pics of Katy.

Ever see an amazing drawing here on reddit, but at least your walls will look impressive.  Follow ArtStore and you, too, could buy one art... or more!  If Zoidberg can do it, so can you.

&gt;Why did you start /r/ArtStore? What was the inspiration?
&gt;&gt;Basically I started it because I was looking for good original artwork for my home, so r/artstore was born.

&gt;What do you hope to see in the future?
&gt;&gt;I just want the subreddit to grow. The more people that are in the community

&gt;What is one of your favorite submissions?
&gt;&gt;My favorite submissions... That is one great part about the subreddit. There are amazing new pieces of art every day. I have purchased a few pieces myself so those are my favorite posts. If I had purchased all of the pieces I wanted to

&gt;What is the average price of something from /r/ArtStore (for future buyers)?
&gt;&gt;I think the prices vary widely. We have artists that having been doing this for years and have successful galleries

&gt;How would you recommend a future buyer pick out their art?
&gt;&gt;It would depend on what that buyer wanted. You can scroll through the post history to get a good idea of style of the artists, to buy the art. If they wanted to do a commission the buyer could make a post of what they want, and allow artists to contact them. Being specific is helpful when making such posts.

&gt;Please tell us about you (the mods):
&gt;&gt;The Mods... Well I do not have any other subreddits that I mod. I have friends and family that are artists but am not an artist myself. Unless you count the atrocities on my mother's wall. I don't. I just adopted a 3 month old puppy, so have a soft spot in my heart for southeast Asia. I work in a kind of non-profit environment and while it is extremely stressful, I like going home and having done something that could really help someone. I don't know what else, AMA. I think Solidwhetstone can answer this one himself. I asked him to help mod the reddit because he is a trusted mod in r/art and r/chicago and I did not know what I was doing when I first started r/artstore.

&gt;If you could have one wish for the subreddit
&gt;&gt;Without constraints? If I say anything less than that this subreddit becomes the source for world peace I am selfish... Barring that

This is the subreddit I've been waiting for all my August, which I always sing when stalking women.  I don't know about you, but I feel a whole lot less creepy if I have a tune in my head.  Just a thought.

This is a classy site where ladies are always too happy to get nakers in the great outdoors.  I personally can't relate a whole hell of a lot since we currently have a raccoon AND Buick-sized bat trapped in the attic and the last thing I want to do around nature is disrobe.  Seriously

I'm really glad this subreddit exists, current reddit superstar.  *sooperstar, but he didn't get far!*

&gt;So you say this is your favourite nsfw subreddit. What makes you say that?

&gt;&gt;I love pictures of nature, but some of them feature beautiful landscapes that would be appropriate for [EarthPorn](http://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn)  had there not been a naked woman in the shot ;)

&gt;Interesting to note

&gt;&gt;I'll admit I don't really know much about the userbase of NSFN, so I think the community there overlaps with the community of NSFN quite a bit.

&gt;Any chance of burn-out? A finite amount of ladies willing to take their clothes off in the woods?

&gt;&gt;Never underestimate the amount of porn on the internet.

The decade of the 20's doesn't get enough credit. Sure, developments in technology and medicine, and the start of several important art movements make the 1920's worth celebrating. So come on over, and listen to some chart-toppers from 1926, read about some of the decade's most scandalous people, or see what stories grabbed the headlines during those years.

*Slapchopsuey

&gt;How did /r/1920s come to be?

&gt;&gt;Probably the same as with any other subreddit; I had an area of interest I wanted to submit stuff about, the stuff I wanted to submit I found interesting, but I figured it wouldn't be that interesting to anyone but people with a specific interest in the 1920s. So I went with it.

&gt;Do you have any favorite posts so far? If so

&gt;&gt;Hmm. Not really; every submission is my favorite in the moment I make it

&gt;&gt;The most recent that did that was [an early science documentary that was essentially 'Astronomy 101' with the knowledge they had at the time, the soundtrack was 'Ave Maria', but done in that sci-fi sound.](http://www.reddit.com/r/1920s/comments/ier9s/perhaps_the_oldest_science_documentary_on_film/). I wasn't aware that sci-fi sounding music was around that early, was a nice surprise. Overall it just had a lot of character to it. This one, like most 20s stuff, I find best taken in late at night, when everything is subdued and quiet

&gt;&gt;Another one that I vividly remember is the [Fordson snow machine](http://www.reddit.com/r/1920s/comments/d2hsw/fordson_snow_machine_1929_concept/) post about a concept vehicle at the time. Ford Motor Company had this thing where they could remove the wheels of tractors or cars and replace them with two spinning cylinders so it could travel on heavy snow. It blew my mind seeing it the first time.

&gt;What aspects of the 1920s do you find the most interesting?

&gt;&gt;The culture, the pace of life speeding up, getting less serious. Flappers :) People very much living in the present.

&gt;&gt;It's the first modern decade, the devistating Spanish Flu pandemic (something of a collective amnesia soon followed, wanting to put the surreal horror of it behind), and the influx of new technology making the world a suddenly smaller place (radio, automobiles, airplanes). As with any era, it was far from utopia, fun

&gt;If you could visit a specific place and time during the 1920's

&gt;&gt;Good question :) A speakeasy would be an obvious choice. I'm from the Chicago area, those are the two places I'd recommend. As for time of day, nighttime would be interesting, as electric lighting was just getting big, and since it was before radar, in some places the skies were filled with the beams from arc lights.

&gt;Do you have anything to say to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt;Post some more stuff! I find all I can and submit it, if you have anything interesting on anything to do with the 1920s, this is as receptive a place for it as it gets (on reddit), so post it! :)",,False,self,True,t3_ihrgo

The following post comes to you from the latest and 4th greatest addition to Subreddit of the Day

EDIT: tuffet... it's a euphemism for arse

[STMLobster]  If you had your own art museum, as well as old favorites, on my frontpage every day. The creator and top mod of /r/museum, hodwik, took some time to answer a few questions from us, your faithful modding team.

&gt;Could you explain the concept behind /r/museum?

&gt;&gt;Well, collage, found-object and sculpture are posted as well.
I started /r/museum because I felt like reddit was really missing a large part of the Fine Art and Fine Art History that I know and love so well. While /r/Art is great

&gt;Any highlights so far in the subreddit's history?

&gt;&gt;I feel like everyday is outstanding over at /r/museum – who wouldn’t like to see a couple fantastic works of art every day?

&gt;Any particular hopes or plans for the future of /r/museum?

&gt;&gt;I’m quite happy with the way things are going right now – I’d just like to see slow steady growth. I worry that too many new members in a short span might bring down the high level of quality that we really pride ourselves on.

&gt;&gt;On another note, and I thought that was a really cool idea. I think it would make a great sister-sub-reddit to /r/museum, but don’t really know enough about historical artifacts in general to feel comfortable starting it. Any archeologists, anthologists or historians out there wanna get together?

&gt;What is your favorite experience or memory pertaining to art?

&gt;&gt;Well, but I was always really bothered by the fact that I wasn’t very good at drawing. Growing up, I had heard that art was not a craft, and that great draftsman and painters were that way because they had some near-magical innate qualities (qualities that we mere mortals could not comprehend) – not simply because they practiced incessantly.

&gt;&gt;I had also heard that the Post-Impressionists and Abstract Expressionists had showed us that realism was obsolete. That to make pretty or sentimental art was a faux pas

&gt;&gt;That line of thinking had really affected me. I thought making classical art was an ‘art-sin’ but it was what I wanted to make. It got to the point that by the time I had gotten out of middle school I didn’t want to make art at all anymore.

&gt;&gt;Anyway, and found out that there are still people out there striving to learn and perfect those old classical techniques. People that thought drawing and painting could be taught to anyone with the work-ethic to practice. They showed me that with proper training I could make the same sort of artwork that I’ve always loved and so desperately wanted to make. They really liberated me from a lot of lines of thinking that were pushing me away from art altogether and reconnected me with two of my greatest loves – drawing and realism.

&gt;&gt;Funny story, suggesting that my tastes somehow devalued the subreddit as a whole. It was amazing to see how Modernism which, of course, was a backlash against some close-minded segments of the art-world, had in that instance turned into the very type of conservative establishment that it was originally against – to the point that people would vocally quit the subreddit as though it was a moral issue!

&gt;In your opinion

&gt;&gt;Well, I do think David Hockney gets a bit too much radio-play. Not a big deal, he just isn’t to my taste.

&gt;&gt;As for underrated, to early 20th century realists like Baccio Maria Bacci, through the great illustrators from Robert Fawcett to the recently passed Jeffery Catherine Jones, and even a number of cartoonists (I love the art in kids cartoons, for example!) are all severely underrated by the Art Establishment today.

If you're confused to what a ""gue"" is, but no one to take the opposing view?  This subreddit might be for you!  It's set up so you can /r/gue your points against other redditors.

&gt;How does /r/gue work?
&gt;&gt;There's nothing too remarkable about how /r/gue works. It's a place for people to argue and debate

&gt;&gt;I suppose one thing that's kind of different is that there's no real expectation that anyone is arguing as they actually believe. Some people may just love to play devil's advocate on controversial positions

&gt;Why did you start /r/gue? What was the inspiration?
&gt;&gt;I've always had a dream of creating a wikipedia-like resource to maintain important debates. Why do we need to keep throwing the same theist/atheist arguments at each other, preferably tagged and with some voting system to allow for a cumulative indication of which side of the argument is winning the day? Well, /r/gue isn't that. I don't have the time or resources for that. But reddit does have a wonderful nested comment system and a built-in user base who loves to argue, so it's a close second-best.

&gt;What do you hope to see in the future?
&gt;&gt;I'd love to see /r/gue continue to grow, the subreddit is a win.

&gt;What is one of your favorite submissions?
&gt;&gt;We don't really have ""submissions""

&gt;Please tell us about you (the mods):
&gt;&gt;There are two of us, to whom I defer for all things programming related. We both agree that arguments are one of the best ways of distilling truth. I, britus, am the one who's a bit more vocal about it.

&gt;If you could have one wish for the subreddit
&gt;&gt;This may sound a bit selfish, the post is driven down into obscurity and everyone loses.

Men. They're like women but a little bit different. There's a high probability
that
not
the former

/r/malelifestyle is a new subreddit gaining popularity fast. But what separates 
it from the sea male-oriented subreddits? We caught up with subreddit moderator
and creator
that question and more.

&gt; Tell us about /r/malelifestyle. What is the core concept?
&gt;&gt; The premise is ""man at his best"" and seeks to promote an inquisitive and 
&gt;&gt; well-rounded life for male readers. Of course female readers and contributions 
&gt;&gt; are welcome too as long as they don't stray from the premise.

&gt; The community is young
&gt; subscribes in the first 11 days or so. Considering that the idea of the male
&gt; lifestyle is something that certainly relates to the 
&gt; majority of reddit users
&gt; extensively by other subreddits (of which you have an extensive list on 
&gt; the sidebar on /r/malelifestlye) -- what is it that separates /r/malelifestyle 
&gt; to those subreddits that also deal with the same topic? What's the secret to
&gt; your success?
&gt;&gt; It immediately satisfied a niche. While there's no shortage of ""male 
&gt;&gt; interest"" subs
&gt;&gt; to have lost its way and my new sub satisfies these readers. 
&gt;&gt; It also has broader appeal too
&gt;&gt; many posts that don't conform strictly to 
&gt;&gt; [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice) can have a home here.

&gt; One interesting difference between /r/malelifestyle and other subreddits is 
&gt; the idea that discussing politics and religion is forbidden. What's the 
&gt; reasoning behind that approach?
&gt;&gt; I restrict these topics because they're already all over reddit and 
&gt;&gt; including them would be a distraction that would constantly threaten to 
&gt;&gt; devolve /r/malelifestyle from its premise.

&gt; There is a fair amount of practical advice given by members of /r/malelifestyle 
&gt; -- is there anything in particular that you've learned since moderating the
&gt; subreddit?
&gt;&gt; I'm always interest in the social aspect of reddit and enjoy seeing the 
&gt;&gt; exchanges in the comments section. Sometimes I'm surprised by what posts 
&gt;&gt; actually receive so many upvotes.

&gt; Any last thoughts?
&gt;&gt; I think that mostly covers it but I hope to see everyone stop by and 
&gt;&gt; I look forward to seeing their posts and comments.",self,t5_2sgno,False,,WRITER,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/i7yr2/june_24th_2011_rmalelifestyle_it_doesnt_smell/

You know, we all had a good laugh. /r/SnackExchange is dedicated to the same kind of glee one feels when receiving a stranger's candy.



&gt;Tell us about yourselves.

&gt;&gt;We're snackexchange. Sometimes we trade snacks, and there was this one girl who reported me to 4chan, Conde Nast, and the police because I made a joke about shipping a cat to China (only the Cantonese eat cats you know, it's not a China-wide thing).

&gt;&gt;Shit's bananas.

&gt;How exactly does snack exchanging work?

&gt;&gt;It's pree easy peasy. If a guy in the US is at the point where he'd fellate a homeless man for marmite because he ate it every morning of his childhood and can't find it anymore

&gt;&gt;An English trader looking for poptarts because we have a shite selection (or lack of) would respond. They'd work out the terms, they take pictures, post them, and revel in their mindless consumerism.

&gt;What made you decide to start /r/SnackExchange?

&gt;&gt;It was an idea that I was toying with for a while based around that old overprotective mum advice, and drugs from strangers so candy is the least of my worries. I was really curious to see if others felt the same way and if a community could be built around pure trust like that (mind you that this was a year ago when subreddits like /r/assistance and /r/random_acts_of_pizza were either just starting out or non-existent. Even /r/meetup was sort of a risqué idea).

&gt;&gt;Then one day someone started a thread in /r/food which mentioned trading some homemade snack for one that they could make. People were actually receptive toward it and made offers which absolutely stunned me

&gt;What has been

&gt;&gt;Clayton646 got a platypus. There was another guy who got these traffic workers in the mass exchange

&gt;Please explain your monthly causes to our readers. What sparked the idea of helping spread awareness for these organizations

&gt;&gt;That's a little more complicated.

&gt;&gt;I've gotten a lot of help from redditors and have had a lot of fun with you lot since signing up. Something like six or seven countries, we didn't even have that ""today you, tomorrow me"" mantra and it was just kindness for the sake of kindness- something absolutely unheard of in an age where civility of novelty.

&gt;&gt;Now we've got something like 5000 members in /r/snackexchange alone, you could do a tonne of good.

&gt;&gt;Right now it's all very avant-garde and I'm just kind of trying to ease people into the idea of reddit as something greater than a news aggregator. We're still not at the point where I can say ""This is some cool shit. Donate to it."" and people flock to support it

&gt;&gt;As for choosing them, and wanting to promote them as much as possible because they're basically operating under the same idea that I want to guide /r/snackexchange into.

&gt;&gt;In the future though, verified personal causes, and altruism subreddits that need promotion. By that point though, I'm going to try and get all of the real world-focused subreddits working together under /r/realworld and /r/realworldmods. Still figuring out how I want to do that :]

**After a short chat about ukuleles and Oxford commas

&gt;&gt;Every username you see on reddit today is a person just like you. Regardless of their past, beyond their opinions, preferences, and beliefs, they're all people. Your own experiences give you a unique way to help someone, and there are many people who need help in many ways- both on reddit and off of it. Put yourself in the shoes of others and live through that perspective. Assist from that perspective, give from that perspective, the golden rule pays for itself a million times over.

We live in a great era of television.  Whatever you're into... comedy, but the point is that if you've got something to record shows, there's no reason to say, ""there's nothing on.""

I spoke briefly with the moderators of these subreddits

&gt;Tell us why you started this subreddit.

&gt;&gt; **cinsere**: To help Redditors connect and multiply.

&gt;&gt; **hypnozooid**: I had been on /r/r4r a few times, so there was a sudden explosion in posts. I noticed that everyone on the front page of the subreddit was straight, so I went back a few pages and still couldn't find anyone LGBT. I then used the search, and found that out of all the submissions in the subreddit, there were maybe three or four W4W, and only around a page of M4M. It also didn't seem like a place that some trans* people would be comfortable posting, so I asked in /r/lgbt whether people agreed that there should be a separate q4q, and so we could have a more trans-friendly environment. Then I made it before waiting for their response

&gt; Do you feel you have succeeded in your efforts?

&gt;&gt; **cinsere**: We have excelled in opportunities for copulation among Redditors

&gt;&gt; **hypnozooid**: Definitely. There are now over 300 subscribers and over 100 posts

A few weeks ago I was browsing some of my favorite subreddits and I came across an article about Battlefield 2.  Now I'm not sure how many of you are gamers and of the gamers that are reading this I'm not sure how many of you play Battlefield.  However the ones of you who know about Battlefield and enjoy the realism and teamwork based play should check out Project Reality.  

""Project Reality (abbreviated to PR) is an unfinished series of tactical First-person shooter video games which aim to create a realistic combat environment and place great emphasis on teamwork and cooperation."" 

-wiki

/ProjectReality is a relatively small subreddit with only 60 or so readers but I figured that there would be a lot of happy gamers if they enjoyed this type of gameplay and didn't already know about this excellent subreddit.

To check out what is needed to play one of the project reality mods go [here](http://www.realitymod.com/) and if anybody would be interested in checking out a video of Battlefield 2 with the PR mod go [here](http://www.justin.tv/sonos/b/279303752)

Start the video above 40 minutes into it.  The communication in this video will show you what /ProjectReality is all about.  

So today we celebrate a subreddit with very few readers but after this I expect it to grow.  Happy gaming everyone and congratulations /projectreality!!

538 Biographers

Hello

/r/RedditBiography allows redditors to swap biographies of each other, learn something about other redditors, and learn something *about yourself*. (That line may be cheesy as hell, but it really pulls this post together, doesn't it?)

AlexanderSalamander, took some time to give us a peek into /r/RedditBiography. Juicy details below.

&gt;Could you please give us a brief biography of yourselves?

&gt;&gt;AlexanderSalamander: My actual biography would probably just be a long rambling tale of a guy who thinks that he's way smarter than he actually is. My RedditBiography would be a dysfunctional story of a bipolar reddit addict who swings wildly between philosophical musings and terrible attempts at comedy. But seriously

&gt;&gt;Antrikshy: I am an Indian student living in a country in south east Asia. I am a perfectionist and one of those anti-piracy freaks. I am also a tech blogger and I run a little blog called Right Now In Tech. I am also a huge computer geek and therefore

&gt;&gt;The_Kenosha_Kid: I'm going to be entering my senior year at the University of Washington (philosophy major), and I write songs all the time. I also write and film skits with my friends, but I don't see any real money coming from that.

&gt;What first inspired the creation of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;AS: I was just reading reddit one day, I AskReddit'd it, and quite a few people thought it was a neat idea. Thus the subreddit was born.

&gt;What is the goal of /r/RedditBiography? Does it draw attention to the sorts of personal information people post

&gt;&gt;AS: RedditBiography is intended to just be for fun. It's a little experiment in how much information you leave online. It's really interesting to learn about the diversity within reddit. The system I set up requires that to get a biography, though. As several people has pointed out, it ends up being a closed system, restricting the growth of the subreddit. Also, since comment histories are public anyway, many feel that you should be able to bio anyone. I am simply wary of being accused of ""doxing"" and encouraging others to take advantage of redditors' openness. I am very open to suggestions and refinements of all kinds. I simply want to keep the biographies a positive thing, not to be used against anyone!

&gt;&gt;T_K_K: I think it should help remind people that ""the hivemind"" is just a convenient strawman to rage against. In reality, and agendas. People often seem to forget that.

&gt;What is the most fascinating biography you have read so far?

&gt;&gt;AS: That would probably have to [k2cougar's biography of gunslingerroland](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditBiography/comments/jzkbn/redditbio_gunslingerroland_wow_i_feel_creepy_now/). It's brief

&gt;Just from looking at the bio posts

&gt;&gt;AS: It's actually really cool to read about the huge differences between redditors. There are bios that range from mountain climbers, video games, humor, and general tech-obsession. What else did you expect? :)

&gt;Do you have anything to say to the subscribers of /r/RedditBiography?

&gt;&gt;""I like to find things on the web that'll help me fall asleep, the thought of not existing, where I'll go in life, super downer stuff. So the audio/visuals I like best for falling asleep to are the ones that serve as little reminders that the world keeps turning without me and that everything will be just fine.

&gt;&gt;...or something

&gt;Describe how r/sleepy has evolved over the year.

&gt;&gt;Well there's some good advice on how you should put stuff in your subreddit before you launch it, and posted several links to stuff I regularly used on the web to help me fall asleep. I didn't want cheesy sleepy links to [half-assed slideshows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJqhh5t-1gM), I wanted [weird stuff that was soothing without even trying to be](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeA9gH_iWXY), and [just super boring long quiet videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ns8vtpD-s&amp;list=PLCB08A85AC0AC107C). But these things are kind of hard to find, so I knew I'd see other stuff come in, I just didn't know what. Sure enough, because of submitters, there's my favorite [RainyMood](http://www.rainymood.com/)

&gt;Take off the superhero mask for us, etc.

&gt;&gt;I'm very laid back in real life, but work has been pretty dry in town so I might have to move. On the side I've also made two short films with some friends entirely for fun; the [first one](http://dirtysextactics.com/) I'm currently waiting to hear back from festivals on-- it screens in Seattle next week if anyone wants to see it. And the [second one](http://www.continuum-film.com/) screens in Portland in two weeks and will be doing festival work later in the year. Both of them had some help from Redditors including kleinbl00, pieceofpi, gorillapoop, and /r/france helped translate a film into French for European festivals

&gt;Hour long lectures? Japanese podcasts!? What th?

&gt;&gt;Yup! Well, shoegaze, and nighttime in the city. I would really love to take a camera and set it in the backseat of a taxi for an hour if I could, and film nothing but driving through a nighttime city. Slap a lowpass filter on it to muffle most of the noise and I'd be in heaven. Another thing is that a foreign language is easier to not pay attention to on account I don't understand it. I've tried falling asleep to [Selected Shorts](http://www.selectedshorts.org/) but it's hit and miss because sometimes I wind up loving the story, paying attention, and staying awake an extra hour.

I recently had the pleasure of havin' a par-lay with the head mod over at r/RedditForGrownups, but I will tell you that they have an interesting concept on their hands, 389 readers so far in their measly 11 day existence.  

&gt;Off the bat

&gt;&gt;Well the idea for this community arose from the swell of complaints I've seen recently from older Redditors about prom/finals/Pokemon posts and things of that sort. I don't think the right reaction is to complain

&gt;&gt;Reddit belongs to both the older and younger generations equally

&gt;I see that after 11 days you've got good numbers

&gt;&gt;So far the response has been great! The community has been very active and we've been growing at a steady rate. There have been a few posts that I've had to remove that were clearly meant to antagonize the community, understand that r/RedditForGrownups is not a knock on any particular segment of Reddit. Just like any subreddit, it's a place for people with similar desires. It is not meant to be a first stop or a front page replacement, just a place for people to stop by when that ""get off my lawn"" feeling starts brewing.

&gt;What's going to happen to your community once it gets huge? What's the future?

&gt;&gt;Well the goal of r/RedditForGrownups was never really to get huge. It's been more about building an active and involved subscriber base. And so far that has been going great. If we do grow huge however, but my and their only real purpose will be to remove obvious troll-type posts. Other than that I expect this community to retain the ability to self-moderate.

&gt;&gt;I would also hope that in the future someone joins in that has a better understanding of stylesheets than I do! As you can see

&gt;I dig people that do things instead of complain about how things should be. Please share your real life with us. What do you do? Tell us about your creative side!

Well I'm a member of the ""Three-Year Club"" and I lurked for a good deal before that, and there will be changes that some people don't like, but the growth of very niche subreddits really goes a long way in alleviating most people's concerns. Whether it's a topic you love or one you hate, the ability to control your front page so specifically with the dozens of new communities popping up every day is really what will keep the Reddit community thriving. That's what got me here. I saw a community that needed a gathering place, and r/RedditForGrownups was born!

We have all been there. You find yourself leaning over a bathroom sink. Face inches away from the silver mirrored glass. Your pubescently driven curiosity has you picking at your face. Searching for blackheads, there is a moment. A moment of pain and pleasure, release and self-infliction. Something erupts out of your pore and splats on your mom's sink/vanity combo. 

It's a rush really. Feeling the clogged become unclogged. I wonder if plumbers get this kind of job satisfaction after unclogging a drain. Probably not

It's funny to me how the internet can facilitate such strage behavior and call it entertainment. What other media form has terabytes of memory dedicated solely to pictures of cats and hours worth of video of people having their cysts drained for youtube! 1080P HD sukka!

I completely undertand that this is not everyone bag of tricks. But what this subreddit can offer you is a look into a world where the best post are the ones you never want to see again.

Sir Mixalot, no boobs, no butt, a pretty face and long blonde hair. No offense if you are this type of girl. We find you pretty, but we love *all* kinds of women. Where are the hot mamas? Where are the shorties? Where are my girls with the [badonkadonk](http://i.imgur.com/P1pMO.png)? I'll tell you where. They are in r/Thick. I can't believe it took me so long to find that place. But its been a treasure trove of many a good ~~faps~~ eye catching moments. Unfortunately I could not get an interview with the mods, due to the rush to beat ~~my penis~~ the presses. I will say, whatever they are doing

1309576682.0,ieqjs,"July 2, 2011  r/RedditPost.  A great subreddit for deltiologists,  I think.",SRotD,39,4

458 friendly

Now, leaves me simply slackjawed with a more-than-normal stunned look upon me face.  I mean, what a great idea!!

1. Get a stack of cool postcards, etc.

2. Post a thread sayin'

3. Watch the PM's roll in and send the cards out to he-redditors or she-redditors from places across the cosmos.

I know you're thinking.  JohnGBongos, is the essence of reddit.  Everything about r/RedditPost is allright, uptight, out of sight!  A place where you can give and get awesome mail from amazing people, so much better than a kick with a frozen boot.  Now, it's a tiny bit more than I described above, so just for CYA protocol, what are you waiting for?  Go visit [r/RedditPost](http://www.reddit.com/redditpost) and help build an already great community!

To sweeten the deal

&gt;This is a brilliant concept. How did this begin?

&gt;&gt;tinyj316:  KellyPride was the one who got everything off the ground. The way that I got involved was through r/cascadia, came over, offered up some postcards, and the rest is history.

&gt;&gt;KellyPryde:  This began when I started to see a few requests around Reddit that were asking people for postcards from specific cities. These were always scattered around the site and never limited to one community. I thought, promoting a bit, etc. Within a week the cards started coming in. I was ecstatic! Also, it doesn't take much to send the postcards out. Any time or money spent is well worth it when you realize you are helping put a smile on someone's face when they check their mail.

&gt;I understand you send x-number of cards

&gt;&gt;KP:  It's up to the sender to decide what to write. Some write about their day, and some simply write your address. A lot of times User Names are jotted down, and that makes them extra special. It sort of brings Reddit to life a little bit.

&gt;&gt;tj:  Of the 35 or so post cards that I've gotten, inspirational quotes, ""offline upvotes"", secrets, fears, hopes, etc. It really runs the gamut. Most everyone has at least something to say about the postcard they're sending...either a memory of a certain thing on the postcard, or some sort of factoid about where they live. It's a social geographer's goldmine.

&gt;Okay

&gt;&gt;tj:  Well, there were a couple complaints that people weren't getting the cards they requested, but those were handled. There has definitely been an improvement in the sending/receiving department.

&gt;&gt;KP:  3 Strikes is the rule that you must send out postcards as well as request them. This is currently being tested out. It's only meant to enforce fairness and not to turn us Mods into bullies. The main reason we're trying it out is to get more people to give as well as take. The only way /r/redditpost will survive is if we have just as many offers as we have requests. I've personally seen an improvement so far

&gt;Why should I subscribe to or participate in RedditPost?

&gt;&gt;KP:  You should subscribe and participate if you like the idea of making Reddit a little more personal, making friends, human interaction, or any of the following: traveling, receiving mail, postcards, art, or just dreaming of the places you've been or someday might go.

&gt;&gt;tj:  Because if you don't, and you'll make a kitten lose its whiskers...

&gt;Please tell me one great story.

&gt;&gt;KP:  I'm sure each and every person who participates could add to this. Personally

&gt;&gt;tj:  There once was as man from Nantucket... He sent post cards up North in a bucket... but the postman named Ada

&gt;Finally

&gt;&gt;KP:  I'm hoping for more members and to reach every corner of the world for participants. I would love for everyone who joins to be able to receive as many postcards as I have (60+) and that will only be possible if there are enough being offered. The more people we have who join and actively participate

&gt;&gt;tj:  It would be cool to eventually put together a ""best of"" book of all of the various post cards that Redditors have received

##Thanks r/RedditPost for bringing the awesome.  We at Subreddit of the Day love you AND respect you!

405 subscribers. A subreddit for 1 Year

We've all heard of [/r/\[humans\]gonewild](http://reddit.com/r/gonewild)

And you know what a squid is

Well

I caught up with moderators [edibledinosaur](http://reddit.com/user/edibledinosaur) and [g_robot](http://reddit.com/r/g_robot) for a quick chat.

&gt; So
&gt;&gt; **edibledinosaur**  
&gt;&gt; miserablex created this subreddit

&gt;&gt; **g_robot**  
&gt;&gt; Well, I was hooked. When the plea came out for a spare mod, I was right there in the wings waiting to swoop in.

&gt; Out of all the posts so far
&gt;&gt; **edibledinosaur**  
&gt;&gt; It gets reposted a lot

&gt;&gt; **g_robot**  
&gt;&gt; Oh my personal favorite: [Make Squid Love More Real](http://www.reddit.com/r/squidsgonewild/comments/el2ts/make_squid_love_more_real/)

&gt; Who wants to take responsibility for the awesome logo and CSS design?
&gt;&gt; **edibledinosaur**  
&gt;&gt; After the great moderator turnover I played around with the CSS and logo before settling on it's current form. r/gonewild graciously let us use their CSS, a few more in paint.net, and a few hours of fiddling with CSS, which I'd never done before. Overall I'm pretty happy with how it's turned out.

&gt;&gt; **g_robot**  
&gt;&gt; We might have stolen the CSS design from good old fashioned r/gonewild. As for the logo

&gt; Aside from being a true ... squidophile? ... cephalophile? -- what else should prospective subscribers know before posting to /r/squidsgonewild? Are there any rules governing posts
&gt;&gt; **edibledinosaur**  
&gt;&gt; The sidebar rules aside

&gt;&gt; **g_robot**  
&gt;&gt; We have rules? I'm just surprised [eel soup](http://uselessjunk.com/article_full.php?id=582) (NSFW) hasn't been posted yet. But seriously, we love it.

&gt; We're all painfully aware of rule-34
&gt;&gt; **g_robot**  
&gt;&gt; My good BauerUK

&gt;&gt; **edibledinosaur**  
&gt;&gt; I'm frequently surprised with how much bizarre squid themed erotica there seems to be on the internet. There have recently been posts from to tumblrs and deviantart accounts brimming with squid-themed oddities. We seem to be just the tip of the iceberg.

&gt; Aside from /r/squidsgonewild, and (to a lesser extent) [/r/octopustomfoolery](http://reddit.com/r/octopustomfooler) -- do you have any other favourite NSFW subreddits (related, or not)?

224 flag lovers

----

""No flag, its people, its culture and values - so much can be represented in a flag.  Originally used to help coordinate battlefields ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags)), they now symbolize a wide variety of things (still, most notably, [flags of countries](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Flag-map_of_the_world.svg/1000px-Flag-map_of_the_world.svg.png)).  Because of how important symbols flags serve, designs have to be chosen carefully.  That's where vexillology comes in - [vexillology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology) is the study of flags of all their various sorts.

/r/Vexillology is a great community for vexillophiles (flag lovers) and vexillographers (flag designers)


&gt;Why did you start /r/Vexillology? What was the inspiration?

&gt;&gt;I started r/Vexillology (r/vexy for short) for three reasons: I like flags, DAE think Maryland has the best state flag, and similar), I figured there was enough interest for a subreddit.

&gt;What do you hope to see in the future?

&gt;&gt;I am entirely too biased for this - my heart skips a beat whenever I see that there is any post from r/vexy on my front page. I just looked through the post history

&gt;What is one of your favorite submissions?

&gt;&gt;They've all been great to be honest. I like unusual flags with weird symbols or images in

&gt;How do you choose each monthly contest?

&gt;&gt;I'd be lying if I said we had a system. Mostly

&gt;What would you say constitutes a ""good"" flag?

&gt;&gt;A ""good"" flag, easily recognized from a distance, and has a story. This isn't hard and fast, of course, but it's a good guideline. I actually am looking at the Czech Republic's flag right now, and am amazed at what all went into such a simple design.

&gt;&gt;I think it's important that they have meaning behind them. For example

&gt;If you were to design a flag for /r/subredditoftheday

&gt;&gt;A flag for /r/subredditoftheday , some kind of laurel wreath (like they used to give the drivers in F1 years ago) &amp; perhaps a light bulb for a bright future!

&gt;If you could have one wish for the subreddit

&gt;&gt;I think perhaps we could set the page up so that the flags are visible from the off &amp; are laid out across the whole page. That way could represent what we're about more by giving the initial hit of colours

&gt;Anything else you'd like to mention about /r/Vexillology

&gt;&gt;I'm just really glad that there are other flag-lovers out there &amp; I can't wait for the future submissions!

Have you ever wanted to just go somewhere and just *shoot the shit*? r/TellMeSomeThingGood is that place plus more. Sure it very tiny compared to other reddits but what it lacks in numbers it shines in comfiness and warmth. Does that even makes sense? in r/TMSTG it does. Its like r/Happy but very chill. Sorta like me after a few beers. Which is a good thing

Before the interview I want to talk about the mods for a sec

&gt;How was r/TellMeSomethingGood conceived? (origin story) / How did you find this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**kerrianneta**: Don't you want to hear something good? Or say something good? I made it as to just shoot the shit with other redditors and stop taking things so seriously. Also

&gt;&gt;**anutensil**: Based only on what I witnessed firsthand, kerri made the comment, ""I'm fed up with yoga. Someone tell me something good."" And she kind of took it from there.

&gt;&gt;**davidreiss666**: Well, I'm sorry, you're not cleared for that answer.

&gt;&gt;**pigferret**: It was Kerrianneta's creation. Just to talk crap and hang out

&gt;&gt;**slapchopsuey**: In Kerri's womb. I don't know the origin story

&gt;Why do you think it was needed?

&gt;&gt;**kerrianneta**: It wasn’t needed. It just happened. Had a conversation with anutensil that we needed somewhere to just hang out and it was born. As you can see from the place

&gt;&gt;**anutensil**: Personally, pigferret told us what he had for breakfast. davidreiss666 brings music. slapchopsuey brings enthusiasm. We're not afraid of being corny and take to celebrating small and big occasions with zest.

&gt;&gt;**davidreiss666**: People like to be nice. And being nice is good. And if you're not nice then we're going to have to kill you.

&gt;&gt;**pigferret**: Most of the mods of this sub all spent time together in the RoTD trenches as mods

&gt;&gt;**slapchopsuey**: It's very needed. There's so much negativity out there, there surprisingly wasn't an obvious place for stuff we found 'good'. Especially with as subjective as 'good' is, by definition it would have to be a small out of the way place to foster a group that shares a sense of common 'good'.

&gt;What makes your community so special?

&gt;&gt;**kerrianneta**: The users. My ""internet friends"" as I refer to them IRL. It's like hanging out in a bar

&gt;&gt;**anutensil**: It feels like an apple pie in front of a fireplace in winter.

&gt;&gt;**davidreiss666**: Kerri

&gt;&gt;**pigferret**: Special people. Not quite ""yellow bus"" special (well

&gt;&gt;**slapchopsuey**: It's something good. Wholesome. Sassy. A place to hang out. These are all simple things

&gt;What is your favorite post so far? Why?

&gt;&gt;**kerrianneta**: Definitely SidtheMagicLobster’s drawing thread. It was my favorite because Sid’s drawings are the best and we just had some good banter going on throughout the thread.

&gt;&gt;**anutensil**: I think the announcement of kerri's birthday from her SO shadowmic7, because it made me laugh so hard.

&gt;&gt;**davidreiss666**: Mine

&gt;&gt;**pigferret**: [Sid's Painting] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TellMeSomethingGood/comments/k5veu/work_of_art_b y_sid_entitled_a_dignified_portrait/). Because it's awesome

&gt;&gt;**slapchopsuey**: It's not one post, that's always a worthwhile experience to have, makes the day or night a little better.

&gt;What is your end game strategy? Is there one?

&gt;&gt;**kerrianneta**: Nope. Just do what you want and don’t be a dick.

&gt;&gt;**anutensil**: We've held strategy meetings and decided it's never going to end. /r/tellmesomethinggood

&gt;&gt;**davidreiss666**: Suicide by rocket launcher.

&gt;&gt;**pigferret**: End? Game? There is no game

&gt;&gt;**slapchopsuey**: To raise the baseline wholesomeness on reddit a notch. There are a lot of downward forces, and hope the butterfly flaps its wings, setting off that chain of positive experiences for many others.

Can we get real for a minute here?   Dave

Ahem.  We at Subreddit of the day, are dads.  I, myself am a father of 2 beautiful children...  I have 3 kids, 2 are beautiful...    Yes, as a dad  I feel I can truly break down fatherhood into 2 simple rules.  (I have 3 rules actually, 2 are simple).

Rule #1.  Your kids look up to you.  Not a moment goes by that they are not looking up to you.  On any given day you'll see love, fear, all the emotions under the sun, but a child's prime directive is to look up to you.  Destroying your furniture is a mere 5th on the list.

Rule #2.  Oh my god parenting is the craziest, when you've had enough and you're ready to abandon them for good in a food court, remember rule #1.  If you can do that, thankless becomes self-congratulated, hardest becomes manageable, craziest job now feels like you can make it 'till 8. (8 p.m.  Bedtime.

This subreddit is an incredible idea and I'm really glad it exists. The idea here (initially) was to create a place where redditors could highlight awesome comments

We're celebrating this subreddit because it's an interesting concept that helps make reddit a great place to be. Sadly it's not as active as it once was

I'm thrilled to have b3mus3d

&gt;Please describe your subreddit

&gt;&gt;Well, but sometimes includes fiction too.

&gt;&gt;I'd also like to emphasise that I prefer to think of it as a collection rather than just a latest-stuff feed: the [top stories](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditstories/top/) are really good to look at.

&gt;How did this begin?

&gt;&gt;This is probably a bit obvious
 that inspired me to start the subreddit. I love how sometimes you can be reading a bunch of normal comments and suddenly

&gt;You've got a pretty large fan base

&gt;&gt;Well

&gt;What's your favourite thing about r/redditstories?

&gt;&gt;As I said in the previous question

&gt;If you could change one thing

&gt;&gt;I'd like to get it back on track a bit to be honest. It's not as busy as it used to be and recently it's turned into something that it wasn't originally intended to be: a showcase for short fiction. I prefer for it to be links to other comment threads, but it feels a bit like when I stop posting, things slow down quite a lot, which is a shame.",,False,self,True,t3_hr8as

We at Subreddit of the Day, one of the greatest mods around.

Hey wizpig64

* The subreddit started out when HelloMcFly (now the user TheShadowBanned) posted [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/di095/to_support_indie_developers_and_because_im_a/) in /r/gaming/,"" and things like that to keep it from becoming a beg-fest. The games are given under the stipulation that, if the receiver likes the game, he should ""play it forward"" by giving another copy away to someone else, who should also give it away, and so on.

What's the most interesting thing about this community?

* One interesting thing I've noticed only recently about our subreddit is the economics of it. In economics, ""yes, it is worth at least this price for me to own this or at least try it out."" Services like Steam are spoiling us, in that a lot of us (myself included) are willing to wait six months to a year and wait for a game to drop in price or go on a holiday sale to purchase it for only a few dollars. At this price, we're willing to give these games a try, but we still don't really know the final value of the game to us. If it turns out that ""Hey, I really like VVVVVV, what I'm really saying is ""Hey, we get to pay the ""true value"" of the product to us

What would you like to change?  What are you working on?

* The biggest problem we have now is that people are reluctant to just give away stuff to strangers with no guarantee that the receivers will actually be playing it forward. We work on the honor system, and giving credit to people who really do play it forward is something that rarely happens. We also run into issues where people give away loads of pay-what-you-want games like those in the Humble Indie Bundles that they only paid pennies for, in order to rack up karma among the PiF community. This has lead to a pretty heavy shunning of all bundle gifters, which I think is a shame given how much love the promotions deserve.

What's the future of r/playitforward?

* Less than two weeks ago, but supporting indie developers. Though we haven't had any official developer promotions yet, we've been in talks with a few devs who are redditors, and we hope to really kick things off once we solidify the website. There are also plenty of cases of developers giving away copies of games in other subreddits like /r/gaming, so we think there is plenty of interest for this to happen. We're really hoping to become a hub where a lot of stuff like that can take place in order to support game studios who deserve some attention. Once we get the details ironed out of the website and become a really grounded subreddit, we should be able to move on and start promoting the subreddit as a way developers and players can interact.

What's the best part about modding for PIF?

* My favorite part personally is how we're fostering a community where people feel they can give to others to express how much they love their games. I love games,,False,self,t5_2sgno,True,,True

Occasionally

Ladies and gentlemen, Head Mod at r/AdoptAReddit!!

&gt;Explain yourself!! How does r/AdoptAReddit work?

&gt;&gt;/r/AdoptAReddit is a meeting ground for mods and subreddit creators. It happens all too often that a great subreddit domain is untended for because the mod hasn't got time to work on it, but also by redirecting attention to it and helping it in its first steps. Or in reviving it of course.

&gt;Please

&gt;&gt;The future of /r/AdoptAReddit is a bit uncertain. Either mods and creators of novelty reddits start using our subreddit on a weekly (although preferably, and do what it is intended for: to make sure that a lot of the excellent domains won't be lost.

&gt;What's the best part about modding for Adopt A Reddit?

&gt;&gt;The best part of modding for /r/AdoptAReddit is that I get to learn about new subreddits before anyone else does. Subreddits nobody's heard of yet, RipperM. He left me the subreddit last week and I gladly accepted. He put a whole lot of work in it, and it pays off.

&gt;What would you like to change?

&gt;&gt;I changed one thing about /r/AdoptAReddit, I am thinking about implementing a method to make sure that the less desirable subreddits don't end up abandoned when A-A-R doesn't find a suitable mod.

&gt;Give us a brief couple sentences about yourself and your greatness.

&gt;&gt;I'd like to end with a shout out to RipperM, I'd like to say: think about expanding your mod base.

After yesterday's celebration of r/Coffee, ""we're going places bubs, now hand over the car keys!""  I had a supervisor like that once, crazy short guy who wasn't happy unless I was miserable.  r/relaxation is exactly like my old boss in that sense... they aren't happy unless you're relaxed!  Although their description tells you they're all about relaxation techniques... you'll find much more.  I could go on, but we've got 4 wonderful mods here to answer questions.  Please enjoy this interview - I think it's one of the best one's we've done!! Got a question of your own?  Post it in the comments below!

&gt;Please explain r/relaxation

&gt;&gt;pigferret: I was stressed and needed a little help from my friends :)

&gt;&gt;kerrianneta: r/relaxation is tips and suggestions on how to relax. Also

&gt;&gt;anutensil: It was created by pigferret one day while he was feeling particularly stressed.

&gt;&gt;slapchopsuey: We all need to do it

&gt;You're 27 days old today. Have things gone in the direction you envisioned?

&gt;&gt;pigferret: Way back in those early days (it's so far away now I have to really cast my mind back), relaxation methods etc.

&gt;&gt;kerrianneta: You're only a month old! Don't hate! We're pretty relaxed

&gt;&gt;anutensil: Hell no.

&gt;&gt;slapchopsuey: Wasn't aware there was a direction

&gt;Where are things headed? What's the future of r/relaxation?

&gt;&gt;pigferret: What's the future of r/relaxation? Shrug

&gt;&gt;kerrianneta: Who knows where we are headed, always music, yadda yadda.

&gt;&gt;anutensil: /r/relaxation is all about making no plans, and remaining blissfully adrift.

&gt;&gt;slapchopsuey: World peace.

&gt;There's way more music videos than I anticipated. Please explain.

&gt;&gt;pigferret: There's also way more music videos than I anticipated. But that's cool. See above.

&gt;&gt;kerrianneta: I was looking at that too and came to the conclusion that music must be something that universally is relaxing to other people. Music really helps you to think about nothing or everything!

&gt;&gt;anutensil: It's just the way the place has been flowing.

&gt;&gt;slapchopsuey: Lullabies of sorts

&gt;I'd like to know your take on relaxation. Please share your philosophy or techniques or even opinions!

&gt;&gt;pigferret: No philosophy involved here. I've been trying a few different methods over the last couple of years. Particularly what is called ""Guided relaxation/meditation"" with headphones. I've been frustrated by the ""spiritualism"" involved in so many of them. (eg. - this one is okay

&gt;&gt;kerrianneta: My take on relaxation is that everyone definitely needs to slow down and relax. Take things one day at a time, whether it's a ride in the car, just watching tv, walking down the pier, grasp it, hold on to it and remember that nothing in life is more important than the ones you love and spending time with them. My techniques are definitely a xanax and a glass of wine. ;) Of course, I love to listen to music and going on a drive really helps me to relax, do what feels right.

&gt;&gt;anutensil: While on reddit, we have our spiritual guide, pigferret, to thank for this.

&gt;&gt;slapchopsuey: Energy is all important to us as individuals and collectively. Stressed energy is rampant in the world lately, be the change we seek in the world, influencing others to relax by example. Also, the AA quote is valuable for the pursuit of relaxation, ""have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference."" (I'm also not a fan of the spiritualism and new-age feel that a lot of relaxation stuff goes with, etc.)",t5_2sgno,True

I am incredibly forgetful, should the tape someday loses it's adhesiveness, will undoubtedly get lost someday or just forgotten on my pillow.  My wife and children will eventually be forced to wear, ""Hello.  My name is"" nametags, and when I shuffle off this mortal coil, loved ones will be heard screaming, ""thank God I don't have to hear that fish joke again!!""   Yes, but there are very few upsides as well.  

Today's Subreddit of the Day, laughs at those who are less than lucid, and teases and taunts the tip-of-the-tonguers.  Where was THIS taken?  I have no clue and please stop laughing like an evil villain!!  In this subreddit, posters go out and find groovy landmarks, photograph 'em and race home on their tricycles to post it to r/WWTT.  All the while laughing maniacally, wringing their hands knowing they have stumped you.

Now normally, because I really like the idea behind WWTT.  I hope we can get some more eyes over there, and more people posting.  Go through your vacation pics, find one with some great identifiable scenery, one where you kept your shirt on, and post that over there.  To those who enjoy the mod interviews (lookin' right at you, V2Blast), I'll edit the post.

r/WWTT.  A frustrating subreddit I'd like to punch in the face.

**Edit** *Thanks AtomHeartMother1970 for the hooking us up with an interview!!  I'm sorry I didn't post this earlier.  You see

&gt;Please explain how r/WhereWasThisTaken works.

&gt;&gt;Basically, and title it ""[WWTT] Hint: Example hint . You try to pick a picture that doesn't give anything away too easily by having clear signs visible, major logos, or other generally obvious things in your picture. But, it should probably be somewhat famous or notable enough that somebody that lives around there would likely be able to recognize it straight away. Then it's a race for everybody else to find out where the picture is from.

&gt;Describe the community members

&gt;&gt;The community is a small place. Everybody seems really friendly. So far there haven't been any complaint threads about the subreddit, who is my friend in real life and he's a great guy. Though, I will give a special shout-out to mepardo, who seems to be our most active user.

&gt;You must have some pretty cool stories - please share one!

&gt;&gt;The only cool story I have about the subreddit is that one of my submissions was actually a result of me going on a trip to St. Petersburg, they had sorted it out.

&gt;Any crazy WWTT stories you'd like to share? Prison photos?

&gt;&gt;Nothing too crazy really

&gt;What's your favourite part about modding for r/WWTT?

&gt;&gt;Certainly my favorite part has been watching the sub grow. I first found the subreddit over a year ago, so I solved one of the submissions. Other than that though, activity in the sub had died a good 3 or 4 months before I found it. So I made a few submissions to try bring some life back, and it started working. At around 150 readers, I asked the admins of reddit to allow me to be the moderator of the sub, because the previous mod had removed himself. Since then I've just been submitting a lot of pictures, and recruited my friend tyguy_3 to help with submissions too. I'm really satisfied that we were able to bring it to a sort of ""critical mass"",,True,t3_hny0x

I really like the idea behind r/kickassday.   It's all about accountability which is normally tough for me as I am not a very *strong* counter.  This site speaks to my inability to do things without proper supervision, if I posted my to-do lists on the internet, I don't get to do my favourite part which is lose the to-do list, then run around in full-on conniption fit.   When I find the list I then cross out ""find list"".  

I don't know if ""doing things"" technically counts as a kick ass day.  I got the chance to sit down and discuss this with m1ndcr1me

&gt;  Please explain r/kickassday to us.

&gt;&gt;r/kickassday is a way for people to hold themselves accountable for accomplishing their own goals, you HAVE to do what you set out to do, barring some unforeseen circumstance. We say that we hold each other accountable for our lists, but it's really a self-policing concept. No one wants to disappoint others. In fact, the reason that I'm working on my current project is because another user has been getting on my case about it for the past few days (for which she has my thanks).

&gt;5 moderators? What?! What's it like modding for r/KAD?

&gt;&gt;We do have 5 moderators, so it doesn't need to be more than a one-man operation right now. I'm the newest moderator. I unofficially took over updating the subreddit in the beginning of May, and I was made a moderator not long afterwards.

&gt;You must have a bunch of great stories

&gt;&gt;My favorite story has been playing out over the last few days, suffers from chronic depression. She's not in a very happy place right now mentally, but she is trying to turn her life around for the better, and her lists reflect that. She's also the one who's been nagging me to finish my own tasks, which has re-invigorated me in my own life. I've been keeping an eye on her; I don't want to see her lose steam just as she's starting to get herself back on track.

&gt;""Your life has a limited number of days. Use them wisely."" How do you live your life according to this code?

&gt;&gt;The Kickassday Code, but it's an excellent proverb. A couple of months ago, I was stuck in my own rut - grad school rejections, no job prospects, a relationship ending - and I wasn't doing much of anything each day besides schoolwork. One day, I just decided to throw everything that I thought I knew out the window and start again. After years of wanting to start, I picked up the bagpipes. Instead of a 9-5 job, I try to make part of each day a challenge

Keeping the future a mystery isn't just a good idea, if you please...

&gt;r/RedditToTheFuture. What. Goes. On.

&gt;&gt;Through some accidental engineering and a lot of bad luck, you might find yourself accidentally falling into the same very wormhole. If you do, make sure you maintain your sense of adventure and imagination. A sense of science and science fiction might also aid you on your trip. Also, beware of ugly beasts reciting poetry.

&gt;Explain how the community members are working. What have the interactions been like?

&gt;&gt;They are working great. We've had some great posts in the 2 months we've been engulfed by the wormhole. There has been a lot of creativity so far. I cannot wait to hear more as we continue to grow. They've been hard at toiling in the mines and pulling up some great nuggets. They've been completely great.

&gt;Are posts driven by imagination or science?

&gt;&gt;I have seen a bit of everything. There's been imagination at work there, I do like reading the creative ones that do have a base in science. Though, I do welcome them all, because everyone has their own taste and sometimes leaving out certain segments that you don't like as much has a tendency to create a situation where you miss some great and awesome gems that you'd miss if you walk around with blinders on.

&gt;What do you see the future of r/RTTF to be?

&gt;&gt;Lets see. What do I see in the future in regards to a subreddit based on the future? I see it talking about even more futuristic gems that our minds have yet to be able to comprehend. Who really knows? Maybe my grandchildren will be browsing through it using the internet connection link in their minds. Personally

&gt;What have I forgotten to ask?

&gt;&gt;I forgot

&gt;What are your thoughts about the movie Armageddon?

&gt;&gt;It would have been much better if they were able to get MacGyver. Though, I wouldn't mind putting that into my dvd player and watching it. Btw, BluRay discs eventually flop and digital downloads gets killed by internet caps and we revert back to dvd, though a large contingent are calling for Laserdiscs. Back to Armageddon, I think it gets a lot of uncalled for slack. A lot of it is that it's very unrealistic. Well, it's a movie, it's for entertainment. Of course, I normally don't watch movies to nitpick things. i watch movies to be entertained. If you sit around watching movies to only nitpick them, you'll have to wait a few more years for that one.",t5_2sgno

Holy shit. This really blew up didn't?     
     
My friend showed me this video sensation about four weeks ago when there was maybe ten videos to watch. Now there are thousands. Beau is a soothsayer. I know some of us are getting a little tired of the Harlem shake. But think about how much better the Harlem Shake is than coning, costumes, and usually someone upside down somewhere in their underwear. What is not to enjoy?     
       
In 50 years when the majority of us are old and decrepit, and how for a month or so in the year 2013, it was everywhere. Our grandchildren will roll their eyes, but they just don't understand. **IT WAS EVERYWHERE**.      
      
And I refuse to give up on this dance sensation until I see Barack Obama do it in the oval office.  

&gt;##1. Explain to those that live under a rock what The Harlem Shake is.   
     
&gt;&gt;**PostYourSinks**: The Harlem Shake is a recent viral trend where people play ""Harlem Shake"" by Baauer and one persons starts dancing in a room with others, doing crazy moves in costumes and other things.  
     
&gt;&gt;**redditballs**: The first Harlem Shake video I ever saw was [PostYourSinks personal favorite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W52rnrwG9p0) on reddit! I had no idea what I was watching 15 seconds in, I went and found 1 or 2 more videos that people had created on Youtube. I figured there had to be a harlemshake subreddit already created, but to my surprise, it had not. I created it, and no more than a few hours later, PostYourSinks came by and ask to help out with being a Mod. If it wasn't me who created it, it was going to be him.

    

&gt;##2. What inspired you to create this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**redditballs**:Besides PostYourSinks favorite video


   
&gt;##3. What is your favorite Harlem Shake video?



&gt;&gt;**PostYourSinks**: My personal favorite is [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W52rnrwG9p0). I like it because it was the first one I saw and has made me laugh the hardest.




&gt;##4. How long do you think this dancing internet sensation will last?

 

&gt;&gt;**PostYourSinks**: I think it will actually last awhile if people start getting creative. Doing the same thing over and over will ensure everyone gets bored of it. If we start to add funny twists I think it can survive.

    
&gt;&gt;**redditballs**: It depends how long people will enjoy it for. Watching Harlem Shake videos brings a smile to your face, and as long as people are having fun with it, it will continue.




&gt;##5. Anything else you'd like to say? To your subscribers or people interested in joining your subreddit? The floor is yours.



&gt;&gt;**PostYourSinks**: I would like to invite anyone who is reading to come over and subscribe. Right now the posts being upvoted the most are the ones with creativity

    
&gt;&gt;**redditballs**: Rock on HarlemShakers!
