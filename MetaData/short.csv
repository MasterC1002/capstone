People are quick to judge short guys. Many guys will make fun of them and some women too.

If a short guy gets upset and reacts

Short guys are told and shown in person, on TV and through [advertising](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GpXGMnOkhs) that they are not as good as tall people.

Children are taught at a young age to view short people [negatively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Farquaad) (I still love Shrek).

We are taught from a young age that the man is taller than the woman. That is what is ""normal"". If two people are in a relationship the man should be the taller of the two. From a little but preferably a head taller. That makes them look cute.

The man being shorter than the girl clearly really weird therefore we try to avoid it.

This is all socially acceptable.

Being shown this

----
Being short makes life harder for guys. They are rejected on the spot for being short

Being short -/-&gt; Low self-esteem

Being short --&gt; Negative treatment --&gt; Low self-esteem

Short guys don't have low self-esteem because they are short. They are mistreated leading to the low self-esteem. This becomes a vicious cycle with people continually treating and rejecting short guys because they are short therefore continuing to lower their self-esteem.


**TL;DR** People treat and view short guys badly. That is why they have low self-esteem. They don't have low self-esteem just because they are short.

**PS**: Everyone knows a short guy who is the awesomest guy ever and has never had an issue with his height. He also gets all of the girls.

**PPS**: Your friend's sister knows a girl who once dated a guy who was a little bit shorter than her. I respect her.",self,t5_2sgvi,1370574602.0,,blue,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1fex8e/short_guys_dont_have_bad_selfesteem_because_they/

I love reading this subreddit and love seeing all the pictures and hearing the stories but one thing has been bugging me that I'd like to share/discuss/whatever.

Some of the most upvoted posts ever on this sub are of short guys showing off very attractive women they are seeing or dating (by the way I'm not slamming any of the OP's of those pictures! I love em!). The comments on these posts are always something to the effect of ""way to go

The thing that's obnoxious to me is the issue of ""heightism"". A lot of guys on here complain about systematically discrimination due to short stature but then you guys go and do the exact same thing! You put more value on beautiful and attractive women then you do on plainer ones! Plain or ugly women get discriminated against and passed up for every type of opportunity in life. It may not be as easy to measure as height but I can tell you that they get skipped all over the place for jobs

One recent post I can remember was posted by a girl who felt guilty that she was dating a really tall guy and she wanted to reassure everyone that she did not discriminate against short guys. The top comment was saying something like ""I just hate it when girls post their boyfriends height like it's the top score in a video game"". Again

Like the girl in the post I was talking about above, or a hip to weight ratio, or a boob size or whatever.

I guess I thought the heightism thing was about something more. I thought it was about not making value judgments about people based on physical characteristics. But it just seems more and more like a bunch of guys who are upset because society doesn't see them as attractive; guys who don't want to upset the status quo but rather just redefine it so they don't have the ""short"" end of the stick.

So I go to a University where I am majoring in business. I'm a 21-year old white male and nearly 5'1 barefoot, I know I'm pretty good-looking (face-wise), and I'm very in-shape/muscular (I go to the gym often). I like to think of myself as a nice guy and pretty outgoing. I haven't grown in around 6 years and the doctor confirmed my height with x-rays, saying that he doesn't see any medical reason for my height and I'm perfectly healthy.

Another crazy thing is my mom and dad are 5'3 and 5'8

Anyway, noticing the size difference. People, even those I don't know, call me everything from cute, little man, midget, etc. And I clearly notice stares while walking around campus. Just the look I get from people when I order food, or ask a question is so noticeably different than the reactions that my friends get. 

Example: Today I went to McDonalds and the ladies inside were openly laughing and commenting on how short and cute I am for like 3 minutes. I went to the bathroom in my dorm and while washing my hands, whenever I converse with a new person they always feel the need to acknowledge my size. I think that because I am good-looking and (this is kind of a weird way to put this but) I've been told I look like a 5'10 guy that proportionally shrunk down to 5'1 - that people don't feel as bad when they comment because I'm not an ugly loser or something. 

Also, and then there's me. I love these guys, but often if everyone is standing around talking and I say something, they all have to awkwardly look down to look me in the eyes and listen to me - of course, its very easy to see what they're thinking. I also always party on the weekends and have to endure a slew of short-related remarks every night from random drunk people. I do have some success with the females, but its very hard for me to find shorter girls that also want a guy my size. 
 
Anyway

So...anyone around my height have any advice/comments on all of this? How do you think my height will affect my future in business? Does it get better after college? Lots of girls are 5'1

When a *tall* guy posts a picture of himself being too tall for a mirror, he would just be pointing out one among hundreds of negative ways his stature affects his life. That's the difference. The tall guy is subtly pointing out his superiority; the short guy is non-subtly pointing out his inferiority.

Being tall has both its positive and negative sides: Physically, basketball, swimming, volleyball etc.). Socially, you'll be more respected, more attractive etc. Of course, some people might feel they ""stick out too much"" etc., if it bothers you, especially for guys.

It's a bit different for girls: They benefit from being both physically feminine (short) and physically authoritative (tall). There is a sort of ideal balance between the two, like dating, but at the same time it can be an advantage in other areas, like sports and business. *Shortness* for girls can be a physical disadvantage in sports and business, but it doesn't drastically compromise your social status / attractiveness (sometimes it can even be beneficial). In short: For girls, there are negatives and positives on both sides of the scale. What's ideal depends on which side you value the most.

Shortness for guys, having disadvantages in many sports, not being able to see shit at concerts and all that shit that accounts for everyone, it comes with a social disadvantage. We're less respected by both genders, less attractive, less heard. . . and the list goes on.

Positive sides..? Come again..? Whenever someone lists up positive sides of being short, maybe it would have been an advantage if it was true, but of course it wasn't; I was 10-20 cm shorter than my peers, not 1/6 their size. What's the point of even saying that? ""Hey, don't feel bad, because here's an obvious lie.""

The fact that he's short seems to give this gravity around him. It just gives him this massive aura. Again

I think the problem for some short guys is that they try to look average. They dress like the average person and act like the average person. So they just look like a smaller version of an average person.

Instead, and act differently. Reframe your height into something of power.

I just want to say that pretty much everything you guys say I agree with.  Women have no problem talking about how they are ""not into"" short guys around me (in fact they foolishly think it is something I would actually want to hear).  If I get upset or angry or assert myself people take it seriously

I don't really know exactly why I made this post.

1371000253.0,1g5yna,"25 years old, thrown back onto the dating seen... woah, not too shabby...",DaSassAssassin,60,28, I'm short

Now, but trust that I've had my share of frustration when it comes to my height, especially in high school and college. I've seen everything from the frequent, light, casual blows to my self-esteem to the outright, ""I don't want to date him because he's short."" Maybe it's because I'm in ""no fucks"" mode after parting ways with a girl I loved, or maybe it's because I've actually discovered a nice balance. Don't know

1) Fuck heightism

-This post is focused on dating, and overcome a lot more. You can let it beat you or you can embrace it and ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine you. 

2) Not every girl wants a 6'4"" demigod. 

-Not every rejection you get is because of your height. If you don't want to be generalized as an angry hobbit or a Napoleon, fuck, I'd do that dude...) If you assume that's what's going on then you just become cynical. That then makes you less appealing and a vicious cycle begins. I know some of you have been put through a lot of bullshit, but you are also in the unique position of being the one who can be the bigger person (no pun intended) and break this cycle. You don't fit everyone's tastes, just like everyone doesn't fit yours. Nobody should be hated for that as long as they're civil about it.

3) Dress well

-This bit isn't about becoming something you're not, bagginess only hurts your cause. I don't quite mean skinny jeans and Jersey Shore tees, but pants that are ""straight fit"" or shirts that are fitted, or ""athletic"" are great. Try to have your shirts end just below your belt if they're not tucked in. ALWAYS wear a belt. Roll up the sleeves on long sleeve shirts. Know your ideal pant length, even an extra inch can make you look like you're trying on your dad's clothes. Seriously, these things help.

4) Maybe a haircut is in order? 

-I'm a little weary with this one, and I kid you not, most of my high school friends thought I got taller. Now for me, it works. I have no hair prep to do in the morning, my head is shaped pretty normally, and I haven't paid for a haircut in 6 years. If you're attached to your mop, do you. Maybe the beard could use a trim? Neck hair? In general

5) HOBBIES

-This is my biggest one. Between guitar, painting, drawing, reading, and building random inventions, all my days have the potential to be filled WITHOUT socializing or a female companion. No doubt should you be doing/looking for both those things, but the point is to enable yourself to not only function, females, but notice I didn't write video games, along with hundreds more

A few more that are probably obvious/recycled:

6) Exercise

7) Fuck the bar/club scene. Put no faith in that, drink, try to hook them up, have no expectations but DO have an open mind, and maybe one of those nights you get lucky, but don't expect it. 

8) Do stuff you want to do. Rock climbing for instance

9) Say yes to things

10) Stay positive and keep the faith

Well

This is just me rambling for a little trying not to freak out about finals this week.

I for one

*23 years later* here I am; 5 foot 1

 One of the things i love most of all, and getting into places; And when we cant reach stuff on the top shelf they're their to save us. Something my friends and I always joke about was the one time I was drinking a small can of arizona black and white tea, while my tall, skinny friend, who happened to be black, was drinking the regular taller 99 cent can of black and white. The lulz ensued.

But let me tell you; i don't think people discriminate on height as much as you often thought. In-fact, and asians at that.) In-fact I myself have even had more relationship experience then most of my tall friends. 

What I wanna say is this, some shorter men. Some guys love tall girls, some like short girls -&gt; Mario and peach anyone?

It's all about presentation; You can go one of three ways; You can make yourself being short hold you down
For those of you who don't think there are many benefits of being short other then hiding under desks during catastrophes; I'll leave you guys with a short list.
Benefits:
1. Less intimating to kids and shy girls.
2. Won't take up as much room in a bed. Sleep EVERYWHERE XD
3. We look more fit with less muscle.
4. We will never hit our heads on a doorway.
5. We often look younger then we are. (I don't think i look like I'm 23)
6. We can get through crowds of people better.
7. If people are giving you a hard time you're closer to the weakest of weak points.
8. We don't need to spend extra-money to buy larger clothes.
9. We can still wear awesome light-up sneakers.
10. I can easier hide behind people to avoid interacting with people I don't like.
11. I can eat less and feel more stuffed ^.^
12. I don't know how many randoms hugs i get

So I might be average looking and short

I am a 5'3 adult male and I have been short all my life. Being short sucks for sure

When I was a teen I wanted to join the military and I amost didn't do it because I was worried about being the shortest guy there and not being able to make it. Luckly, I made it through basic training, got promoted faster than anyone else in my class, and ended up really enjoying time in the service.

When I got out of the military I knew I would face another challenge finding a good job. ""Short+Shy"" didn't seem like the best combination for success in the corporate world. When a rep for my dream job offered me an interview I tried to talk the recruiter out of it. I didn't think there was a chance in hell I was going to get the job

Dating has always been the big challege for me. At one time I thought I would never find anyone, etc and over the years I have met plenty of girls that didn't really care about height, or If they did I was able to change their mind about it, or I would accept the rejection and move on to someone else. I have had some awesome relationships because I didn't let my height become my crutch.

For reference, but I have been living in europe for a while, where that's the average height for a woman. I'm late 20s and I have dated plenty of guys the same height as me (mostly back in my home country but also here in europe) or taller.

I have been using online dating ever since I moved here, they always seemed not to be interested in me (maybe because they expected me to be shorter? They usually had the same height as me listed in their profiles but in person were shorter).

Well, so he grabbed a drink and we got on talking. So it was a while before we stood up together and I realised he was shorter than me (I feel is a bit offensive to say a ""halo effect"" happened there, I don't necessarily assume anything relating to people's height), about 3 inches I would say. I didn't think anything of it (but later had a look at our profiles and he listed himself a inch taller than me...). 

That was a month ago and since then we have been seeing each other once a week always for fantastic dates and amazing sex. My impressions have been:

- I'm quite large, so is quite often that if I'm with a skinnier guy than me, I feel like a huge blobby monster when having sex... That doesn't happen with this guy. Lying down, height is so hard to notice, that it becomes much more about his body proportions, which are just perfect.

- I have come to appreciate the fact that at the same time

- I have always felt 69 was a damn clumsy position

- He has only commented on his height once this whole time, I don't tend to find this kind of comments endearing, but it was pretty harmless as far as it goes. And thankfully it wasn't in comparison to my own height.

- I actually really like having a good excuse not to wear heels

- It really doesn't bother me at all our height difference, I do appreciate the information that this is something that might be in his mind, hence why I decided to look a bit into on how to be sensitive about it)

- When we are holding hands across a table, when he kinda noticed that he then complimented MY hand. I through that was awfully nice and smart of him, because if I felt weird, it really had nothing to do with his hand being small, but mine being large.

1351709621.0,12ev86,A rally cry for all the short men out there!!!,alive41stime,50,7,21,"(Disclaimer

Listen up guys (sorry to exclude girls but this advice really only relates to what short guys go through when hitting on women)!

I was short my whole life and skinny, etc... But somehow, somehow!!!, I developed a huge personality and today, at 30 years old, I still wear it proudly, it is who I am.

We all know that we fight with one major drawback in our short-statured lives. Women. For whatever reason, call it the media, movies, peer-pressure...whatever. A very large amount of women seem to hold true to one of my favorite lines by Modest Mouse:
&gt;You ask me what size it is. Not what I sell.

You know, to the point where I would even 'down' myself during conversations, saying things like 'I know I am a pretty small guy but..."" etc...

I used see women that were taller than me and think **""Ok

Know what I tell myself now? 

**""Alive41stime

You are going to conquer this mountain

Because it IS bullshit. We all know that

And after I prove to this girl how it REALLY is

So take this advice, but stop allowing yourself to disqualify them. Make them disqualify YOU. Its not like we aren't used to it. Turn that into a strength. Most girls, believe it or not, are just going to give you a hard time in the very beginning, frankly because they are insecure about themselves. Push through that first part, work four times as hard as the average-height guys, something else you are already used to doing.

If they make a comment about your height. Use humor. ""Wow

Be yourself and don't allow them to brush you off

DO IT!!!!! Every time you win

And take it from me, converts one more girl! 

SMALL POWER!!!! We are more unique anyways. I now love being small

Overall, I was very upset, but I realized it's just not my effing problem as unjustified as her racism was. Most people don't care and some people who matter to me actually like my ethnicity. I got up and left. I rejected *her*. Replace ""Jew"" with ""short,"" and I realize I would have responded correctly if she railed about how short guys are creepy. There's 100 things a woman can legitimately or illegitimately reject me for. It's her problem. She doesn't get to date *me*, because I don't date racists.

Sometimes you have to smirk and say to yourself ""you can't win 'em all."" No one can be responsible for others' preferences, but irrational people tend to act...irrationally. Getting mad or trying to defeat a stupid argument with logic is like pouring gasoline on the fire. You just can't take things personally as hard as it is. It's practice. I'm only just beginning to figure it out well into my 20s.

Also, it was something completely different. 

I empathize with short teen guys because I was a short teen guy. I realize shit can be very bad when your entire world is high school or college and you're surrounded by immature idiots looking to impress other idiots. However, but I didn't like them for equally superficial reasons. Instead, I convinced myself no one I liked, liked me because I was short. This internalization led to me to act in ways that actually impacted my status until recently: I walked hunched over, I didn't make eye contact, I dressed like a kid in clothes that didn't fit (partly because I thought I would look ridiculous in clothes I actually liked), I did things to please others, I mumbled. Guys: seriously ask yourself if and why you do any of these things.

I'm not saying to look on the bright side of being short, you probably dismiss it and worry about the asshole and how you should change his perception of short people.

1350434162.0,11lo9c,Went out with a girl taller than me.,irbananaking,37,7,50,"I know that title has probably appeared a billion times now. My friend introduced me to one of her friends who was new to my school. I'm a senior and she's a junior. My friend had told me that she was one of her shorter friends but she is still 2-3 inches taller than me. She's nice and I like her.
**TL;DR and skip the first 3 lines if you don't want the boring description**

We've gone on one or possible two dates. The first time we went to the country club next to my school and hung out

The second date was this weekend. She referred to it as a date so I was happy and called it that too. I don't know if this matters but I paid for the tickets before she showed up because my friends insisted that I had to. She insisted she pay for the popcorn but I paid. The movie went well

Today I got two texts from her telling me that I was too short for her and I should stay away from her. I sent her a ""?"" then she texted me apologizing and telling me that it was her friends.

So that worries me that her friends think I'm too short for her and that they're gonna influence what she thinks of me.

**EDIT: She said that her friends took her phone and sent it.**


**EDIT #2: So I talked to her today and found out exactly which friend it was: her ""special"" friend who has ADHD and acts crazy. I met that friend today and all she did was talk about how she's not going to vote for Mitt Romney. We're in Canada and she's 16. Though this may sound mean

Granted, and this isn't usually restricted to online dating.

Am I the odd one out here in that I've never had any issues with this before as a man? Surely I can't be completely alone.

There are only a few things I dislike about being short:

* Finding a nice winter coat where the arms aren't too long is a pain sometimes.
* In very large crowds it's tough to see what's going on if there are too many tall people in front of me
* Finding pants/jeans that aren't too long can be annoying. This can sometimes go for dress shirts

Apart from that I'm happy at my height and I never really gave too much thought about it until I started hanging out around here in this subreddit. I've always just been used to most everyone else being taller than me and never saw it as a bad thing.

This reminded me of a quote made by the dwarf Tyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones), as my ambition is a fundamental part of who I am. It would exist regardless of my height. My height (primarily the bullying which came with it) simply pushed me to accomplish my goals regardless of my stature. This next portion may sound arrogant, but please understand that I have struggled for everything I have achieved (once again, not too much). In terms of scores alone, I'm easily one of the top students in my school, and in the country. That is one reason my teacher believed I would find meaning in this quote, especially since I was the only junior enrolled in the course.

It makes me absolutely furious that this type of discrimination exists in the world, considering how far we've come from the era where racism, segregation and intolerance was once rampant and is now looked down upon with disgust. Also i find it so amusing that some people on that twitter page are so ignorant that they even demand short guys to be taller, as if it's something we can control, as if we have a choice in the matter.

I understand that some women might not find short men to be attractive, hatred and discrimination aimed towards short men is simply unacceptable in a modern, civilized society. To think that in a society where a comment containing even slightly racial connotations can cause a public uproar; that these type of extremely vitriolic comments are viewed as okay, is unbelievable and a disgraceful disappointment.

As a female moderator of a growing subreddit, rather than an SO, or if there would be a different reaction if the height difference wasn’t so drastic.

 It is behavior like this that gives our subreddit a bad name, ESPECIALLY if a woman posts that she is dating a taller man. I am opening this up for discussion, because I want this subreddit to be an enjoyable place for everyone, regardless of height, gender, and partner-height, whatever. 

No woman should ever feel afraid to post something on a subreddit they feel comfortable in with fear of being yelled at or told they are pouring salt in the wounds. I can understand if the posts were stating something like ‘Look how much taller my boyfriend is compared to you!’ That doesn’t happen, I ask you all, remember that the people on this subreddit are just that, they are PEOPLE.

If a post is truly malicious, but don’t downvote something into oblivion just because someone wants to share a joyous moment in their life.

------
**The Confidence Trap**


There seems to be a plethora of guidance and advice on the internet for short people.  However, people who criticize short people (under the guise of encouragement or advice) focus on some perceived hidden virtue which short people are said to generally lack – a virtue that has nothing to do with height.  Usually, after much anecdotal evidence suggesting the inferiority of shorter people, this virtue is revealed to be “confidence” or “self-esteem”. 

Granted, can one say that confidence should be more important to shorter people than to those who are taller?  Mustn’t the anti-heightism argument say that short people need only the same amount of confidence that other people supposedly posses?  And how does one measure “confidence” anyway?

The fact is that the “confidence argument” is merely a technique to diffuse and direct attention away from the social problem that is heightism.  Telling short people that they lack a magical and hidden virtue having nothing to do with height, and actually the result of an inner defect, society takes the impetus for change away from the perpetrators of bigotry and hoists it onto the shoulders of those who are victimized.

Short people should be confident.  But this is no solution because all people should be confident.  The justification for the additional confidence that short people are suggested to acquire (or that short people are perceived to lack) is the result of the social construct which turns physical “tallness” into a virtue and devalues people who are perceived to embody a lack of this trait as inferior.

In fact

So, we are shamed as being overconfident.  This is another catch-22 that short people would do well to avoid. 

The key is not confidence.  The key is social justice.  And the issue is heightism. ",self,t5_2sgvi,False,,blue,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ggxgu/the_confidence_trap/

This person said:

I won't rehash those arguments here but you can see my submission history for the main discussion


[This psychological study looked at the relationship between self deprecating humor vs other types of humor on short term and long term attractiveness](http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/95822/self-deprecating-humor-is-sexually-attractive.pdf)

You don't have to read the whole thing


&gt;In particular, there was little difference in long-term attractiveness between self- and other-deprecating humor.
We theorize that high-status individuals can more easily afford to make fun of themselves.

and 

&gt;Thus, defeatism, subordination, low self-esteem, and/or low mate value. On the other hand, if an individual has achieved high social status, they are unlikely to have truly low conscientiousness, or emotional stability, introversion


Granted they weren't referring to height in this study but based on the way society views height it's pretty easy to apply this to that context where according to society short stature = low status and tall stature = high status.

I hope that is enough to satisfy the holdouts!  You aren't doing yourself any favors with self-deprecating humor.  ",self,t5_2sgvi,1375375432.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1ji4jh/a_scientific_study_that_proves_self_deprecating/

The second context is in the field of interpersonal relations, and smaller stature individuals as less so.  By making self deprecating remarks regarding height in any kind of leadership setting, all you are doing is subconsciously adding fuel to the fire in these attitudes, and again while you may get some cheap laughs, any marginal benefit you might see as funny is easily eclipsed by the negative subconscious spotlight you put on yourself by bringing attention to your small stature.  


Thirdly, a short individual, making short jokes, you are telling people that it is *okay* to make jokes about height and thus altering their perception of heightism from a serious subject to one that cannot be as serious, if height ridicule is indulged by a supposed victim of it.  Oh I know, you may think you're just 'joking around' with your friends, and it may start out as a friendly barb, and each joke collectively makes society perceive heightist behavior as less taboo than it should be.  Only by taking a firm stance against these jokes, society will start to interpret them just as seriously.  Obviously that progress is interrupted by tacitly approving it with self deprecating jokes related to the matter.  Hardline feminists catch a lot of flack, and that starts with ourselves."

This is a strong study that gives very strong evidence against a lot of armchair evolutionary biology that you hear regarding dating and height. What you often hear, instead of arguing that modern society does not require protect, just tell them that is bunk! Think about this following study done by Australian researchers in 2011. The basic premise rests on this: if sexual preference for height is genetic, then twins should more likely than not select mates that are the same height more so often than siblings that are not twins. 

Please see figure 1 (http://imgur.com/pRM3u).
Key: 
MZF: female twin
MZM: Male twin
DZF: Female sibling
DZM: Male sibling
there are two numbers, which is much more strict. Thus, .02(.07) means that there is a low correlation with a confidence of 93% that there .02 is a real statistic rather than just chance.

*There are 3 key points that you should know!*

**1)Preference for height is not genetic**

This study looks at a sample of &gt;20, and all personality scales, but there were small but significant correlations between twin pair partners for education, income, religiosity, attitudes, and age”  (mate choice heritability = 5% for males and 8% for females

**2)Preference for height is not based on a Female Father’s height**

 “In particular

**3) When parents influence who you find attractive

“This family environment effect, may reflect parental influence over mating decisions. “

**Next week:** Clearly, but *something MORE IMPORTANT* This will be discussed next week!

When I went to Hong Kong i noticed that the heights of the people are much less consistent.

 The average height here is 1.707m (5'7"" in) and Hong kong is 1.717m (5'7"" 1⁄2 in) according to wikipedia. That's 1cm difference. When I went there I noticed that there are MANY tall people over 185cm/6'1"". I'm not talking about the white people

 Why is there a big difference in height when the average heights of Japan and Hong Kong are only 1cm difference?

Anyone from Hong kong or Japan here know why? Is Japan just too consistent or is Hong Kong really weird lol?

1375439524.0,1jk20h,My experiences about height during my study abroad semester in Africa,PantsIncognito,22,1,8,"I mentioned on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1jew6r/does_it_feel_really_bad_when_you_have_to_go/) that I had some insights regarding height when I went abroad last semester. I figured I would share it in case anyone had an interest in this topic. I tend to write way too much when I post

I was originally supposed to spend my semester in Copenhagen, and academics between when I applied and when I decided to cancel the study abroad program, but the concern of me being noticeably short played a small role. Although my height concerns played no role in where I decided to apply to next, I ended up going to a West African country instead, where the average male height is 5'6.5'' (incidentally my height). Here are a couple of things I remember regarding height while I was there:

* Our study abroad group was majority female (85%+). The range of height was so large (4'11''-6'0'') and there were so many people that I thought it was true representation of average female height in America.

* I was surprised to find that short men were [over]represented well among our study abroad students. Of our group there were six of us Americans who were pretty much the same height (5'6''-5'7''), but I never asked.

* African men attending the university (which was the school with the highest prestige and international appeal in the country) were either much taller (&gt;6') than me or much shorter than me (&lt;5'3''), I was taller than ~60-75% of the men there.

* Heels were the requirement for a lot of the nightclubs in the city. Even in the clubs without this requirement, but I did not notice any pattern of height among the wearers. The rest wore sandals, sneakers, or flat driving shoes.

* I noticed that the taller men were almost exclusively from the elite class of society (wealthy students from neighboring countries, etc.). From what I saw these were the only men (with a few exceptions) who hooked-up with white foreigners (for the most part) or Black Americans. A good number of these men had a reputation for hooking up with a lot of new foreign Americans every semester. By and large, western/westernized American women who did hook up with African men, did so exclusively with tall (6'+) African men. I feel weird mentioning this, but this point was pretty clear and very out in the open.

* The shorter men were the ones who came from working class or middle class families and were usually the ones paying their own way. The shorter men who did have relationships with foreign women were usually with African American women (meaning these women were the daughters of first generation immigrants to America who came back to study abroad in Africa for a semester, white American woman (~5'8''-5'9'') and a shorter, African man (5'5''-5'6''). There was also one relationship between a white American woman and a light-skinned African man where the couple was near the same height (5'5''-5'8''), but the man was still taller by about an inch or two.

* There were a few African women that were my height or close to it

* Among African couples I saw in school

* When discussing the ""height aspect of dating in America"" many of my male African friends (tall, although they did recognize that there were a couple of women in the country that spoke openly of a height preference. While some of my friends did mention a preference for ""petite"" women (which was by far the most common body type), most agreed that body size didn't matter too much (height or weight).

* I encountered no height jokes towards myself or others while I was there - and I usually notice those while in America. Even when the opportunity presented itself, background, strength, reputation, etc. were fair game). Women that chided men never targeted their height.

* I saw no indication of there being a cultural trope of short men being prone to insecurity, etc. Nor did I see or sense any sense of entitlement, pride, or view that taller men were better leaders, partners, or ""masculine/confident men"".

This trip really solidified and reinforced my view that heightism and the great importance placed on height in the Western world (and the countries with very close ties to them ie. China and S. Korea) is a social construct rather a true outcome of innate biological drives. I am aware that some may say that I had a biased view while I was there due to my short height

**Woman #1:** He's a guy that hangs out with us some time.  The girls like him but the guys hate him.

**Me:** Why?

**Woman #1:** Guys don't like him because he is constantly arguing with them about something or another.  He also turns everything into a competition with other guys, he won't talk to you for the rest of the night, and might even punch a wall because he is so angry.                                                                       He also will insults guys all the time.

**Me:**  Well

**Woman #2:** Well, and be super friendly with us.

**Woman #1:**  I can see why guys wouldn't like him because of how confrontational and arrogant he is

**Guy Friend:**  Yeah, and enjoy company.

**Me:**  He's REALLY tall isn't he?

**Woman #1:**  YES!  He's 6' 4"" tall.  How did you know that!?

**Me:**  Because a short man would never be able to get away with behavior like that.

**Woman #2:** That's just a good guess.

1. posts about awesome famous short people

2. funny posts about being short

3. insightful posts about being short

4. posts exposing heightism 
Note: Yes these are depressing but I feel that it is important to expose the very real issue of heightism. You guys managed to show somebody the ill of their ways today to the point of them apologizing on this sub. That is genuinely impressive and it goes to show that we can make a positive change. I saw heightism as a bit of a fluff term before I saw some of the stuff on here

5. MOST IMPORTANTLY: posts showing off your accomplishments as a short person. Good at a sport? Got a great family? Got awesome skills? Show us that shit. (Also

So, less competent, less able to lead others or garner respect, less sociable, and less attractive (broadly speaking).  My theory as to why this is deals with gender norms and a socialization process which is widely fostered throughout our institutions, our families, and our interpersonal relationships with other adults.  In fact, for most people

So, which I suspect that it is, we cannot hope to ever challenge it if we are continuously side-tracked.     

And, if you have that attitude, you have already lost.  You have missed the proverbial forest for all of the trees in the way.  Your higher rejection rate isn't heightism, *per se*, but it arises from the same social structures that you are trying to ignore.  Plus, focusing on ""the dating effect"" of heightism simply makes the entire prejudice look silly in the eyes of the general public.  Have you ever noticed how complaints of heightism are often met with a rhetorical pivot about women and attraction - even if the grievance had nothing to do with that?

There was this huge controversy over some research that Brazillian doctors were working on a substance called [""CNP""] (http://www.naturalheightgrowth.com/2013/07/29/bmn-111-a-cnp-analogue-promotes-skeletal-growth-treating-children-suffering-from-achondroplasia/) that was supposed to help dwarves grow taller in the form of a pill. Men went crazy over this and some [Turkish doctor promised individuals that he came up with a compound](http://grow-tall-forum.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=recent) which would do the same for short males. He charged individuals $200 for a ""starter pill"" and then $500/mo for the ""formula"" all under the guise of a trial. Turns out he pocketed thousands of dollars from tens (maybe hundreds?) of unsuspecting (read: stupid) people who of course were just left with empty pockets. If I'm not mistaken, from tens maybe hundreds of people?

1361859276.0,198usu,I betrayed my fellow short men...,irbananaking,24,7,89,"I'm a senior in high school and my height has always been an issue... (insert generic stuff here).

My girlfriend is 3 inches taller than me and that difference didn't matter to me and it didn't seem to matter to her. She would defend it and tell people that height didn't matter. Some people still commented about how it was weird and didn't look right. My friends joke that I'm dating an ""Amazonian"" 5'6"" girl.


One of my good friends had asked me about my shoe size a few weeks ago and I told her and asked why. She said she was ""just wondering"". Last week she surprised me with a two month late Christmas present: shoes with 2.5 inch lifts. I was offended at first but the next day I was curious so I tried them out. They were kind of uncomfortable but I decided to try them out. I eventually got used to them and have been wearing them for about a week.


Being just 2.5 inches taller has made me more confident and I feel that it kind of goes against my views that a persons height shouldn't matter. Nobody has commented about my shoes except for my annoying younger brothers. My friends and girlfriend haven't said anything about it but it feels so much better to be a closer height to her and to be taller than some girls because in general I'm not taller than anyone. Either my friends don't want to say anything about it or they just don't give a damn.

TL;DR - I've started wearing shoes with lifts and they make me feel more confident but also that I'm ""cheating"" (tough to explain).

Have any other guys worn lifts? Is it wrong for me to wear them?

* I'm 26 years old

* My height is 155 cm (5'1''?), brother is 5'8'' or 5'9''. But my mother and sisters are all of them 5'0'', so I guess I got her height. 

* In my country I think the average height is around 5'6'' I think (we don't have any statistics about it) so even around here I'm considered short, hardest thing in my life has been being told that I was done growing, that's something awful to tell a 14 y.o). It took me sometime to accept my height as nothing else but a number, but I finally did it around the time when I started med school (It also worked for me that in that time I lost like 30 lbs). But after that I started *poco a poco* (I don't know how to say it in english) to start telling people that I didn't like people telling jokes or playing jokes on me because of my height (Like people grabbing my pen and just stretching their arms up in the air, I would tell them to fuck off and tell them to grow up). 

* As far as the dating scene goes, since I'm telling almost all of my life here I'll say I used to weigh 189 lbs 5 months ago, right now I'm on a weight-losing streak which has me down to 163 lbs and healthier than ever). But let me just tell, for the record, that I definitely like short girls (2 inches up or down my height). 

* I haven't encountered much heightism in my country

* As a bonus, I've seen many taller friends hit their heads while being inattentive while walking. 2. Don't reach the top shelf in stores? That's why they have employees. We can reach the down shelves easily, whereas taller people have to kneel down (which I've seen can be a pain in the ass for them). 3. People don't expect us to be strong, so we can impress them by showing our real strength and they will respect you even more once you do this. 4. Cars, there's no much limitation for us (I drive the huge Chevy Spark now, my dad barely fits in it lol). 5.

1353261700.0,13em2l,PSA: Some things parents can (not) do to stop perpetuating heightism,forevershort,36,17,70,"Keep this in mind if you are a heightist aware parent or friends of a parent.

1.  Don't tell your kids that they should eat their vegetables so that they can grow up nice and *tall*.  In fact, it's a double whammy because it perpetuates the myth that diet makes a difference in your height in 1st world countries, and that short individuals were ""bad"" eaters.  

2.  Don't keep a marking of your kid's height on the door frame in the kitchen or wherever.  This isn't as obvious as point #1, because it just creates expectation.  In fact I would just leave all height measurement up to the doctors.  

3.  Pretty obvious, like point #1 it reinforces that being ""tall"" is something in itself that should be aspired to, instead of intelligence or skill.

4.  NEVER USE THE PHRASE ""you just haven't finished your growth spurt(s) yet"".  Especially past the age 16 or so.  You may not mean it, somehow represents an unfinished stage of development, and that they are incomplete.  Not all kids go through growth spurts, or even one, and this is devastating to keep hearing this when you haven't grown for years and people still think you shouldn't be done.


5.  After a certain age, given the implications about weight and everything.  But too often you see some mom who just won't accept her son's short stature and manifesting this delusion by buying clothes that are consistently too large, as if, if they do, their son will grow into it.  This obviously can be very psychologically devastating having a parent buy these things that just lie around because you'll never fit them, a very tangible reminder that you aren't ""tall"" enough for their expectations.


6.  Don't use expressions like ""that was a petty little thing you did"" or ""don't be short with me"".  Obviously.

7.  Mothers, still exhibit loud and visceral negative reactions at the prospect of their daughters dating a short man.  So much so that beyond belittling the man to their daughter in private, they'll do it right in front of him!  My theory is that subconsciously, they realize that if their daughter marries and procreates with a short man, they might have, *gasp*, short male grandchildren.  And since they realize how badly they get treated in society, they try to shame their daughters into avoiding that fate.  

8.  No disney.  Nothing pushes the ""every girl deserves a tall, strapping figure.

If anyone asked me my type I wouldn't have said short guys (I would have said smart guys) yet everyone I dated was my height or a little less

Of course my boyfriends' relative height could have something to do with the fact that I'm a 5'10"" chick. Plus my mom had me in ballet during my formative years and I do yoga now so I have excellent posture which stretches me to my fullest height. But mostly I truly am attracted to personality. I like a smart, which has led to relationships that have passionate beginnings and explosive ends. Anyway, it's not like I've been out looking for short guys, they were always the ones who came on to me, but it turns out that that's who I tend to date, for whatever reason. 

One LTR was with a man who was only just 0.5 inches shorter than me. Not even anything I'd think a person would notice. We went out

Anyway

So on to me, which my friend's alcoholic boyfriend consumed almost singlehandedly, total jerk move, but FF wasn't upset, he was really cool and just wanted everyone to have fun. That stuck in my head that he was a nice guy and a gentleman so I started admiring him, still not having a clue he liked me. (He says it was obvious that he was interested in me and I was oblivious for not noticing it, LOL.) Also I was wearing these towering heels that night that were like silver cages and looking at the pics of us in a group he came up to like my shoulder. Did I mention he's 5'7""?

Anyway we started dating and I started wearing the hell out of my one pair of ballet flats. This is our first night we spent together:

Me

FF (laughing too): What? Did something surprise you?

Me: Ummmm

FF: Did you think because I'm short that I'd have a small dick?

Me: Well...maybe yes?

FF: So you're surprised then?

Me: Yeah

Fast forward six months and I gave all but my two favorite pairs of heels away to my sister

Now I have ballet flats in every color, but all the tall shoes she wears to work and to go out have given her foot problems and her podiatrist wants her to wear sneakers now.

* I think we all know to forget online dating but if you do that
* Shortest girl I dated was 4'10""; tallest was 5'10""
* Born and lived around San Francisco
* On my dad's side
* I'm habitually single which I think is more to do with my inability to express emotions well but I know I've heard plenty of people say to me or within my earshot that ""if only I were taller."" I think it's because I have a lot to offer everywhere else: hard-working, and physically attractive. I feel like I end up being a lot of female's sex buddies while they're in between ""real"" relationships. That's not terrible at first but it's tough when you get genuine feelings for someone over weeks and months of sleeping with them, and they always back off. I know a lot of you say ""well if they care, then they're not worth it"" but I'm sure there are a lot of great people with that weird ideal, hell, maybe I express that same ideal in a different way I'm unaware of. 
* I'm for the abolishment of the gender in general. It may have served an ancient purpose but modern conventions make all of that irrelevant. But we do this because we don't want to reevaluate a lot of these traditional social standards, ancient machine. We can do better than this.

1362862844.0,19zkx9,My view as to why /r/short isn't like /r/tall.,irbananaking,27,12,8,"Some people have commented that /r/short should be just like /r/tall. 


/r/tall and /r/short are communities. Just like fishing or skiing or dancing or medical condition or religious related (I'm just coming up with random things) subreddits are communities based on those things.

They can post positive, humorous things related to their community and it's fine because they're not comparing themselves to another subreddit.
Comparing one to the other isn't always a good idea. 


The fact that we're comparing /r/short to /r/tall is a bad idea. The tall communities has many things to benefit from and positively joke about. The short community not as much. /r/tall also has about 7 times more users than /r/short therefore it makes sense that they have more posts.


Tall people can speak about their heights whenever and wherever they want and it's *usually* fine. Short people *usually* cannot express their negative feelings about their heights anywhere but on the internet and /r/short is a community where they can share it with other short people.

The main tall issues seem to be planes, and clothes (XXL clothes is easier to find than XXS). Short issues are so negative because they tend to be more negative issues.


There are many posts about heightism on /r/short. Heightism is basically discrimination of people based on their heights. Not just short. Racism is discrimination of people based on their race. Not just one specific race. However people of tall heights are not subjected to heightism as much as short people. Just like white people are not subjected to racism as black people.

Therefore /r/tall has many more positive things to post about than /r/short. There is common ground but the fact that some people want them to be identical is impossible. 


The top posts on both subreddits are all pictures of funny things regarding the size of objects or with SOs so we are similar in that way.

After reading these threads and seeing how people make rude comments about short and average height people, he still isn't considered because his height disqualifies him instantly due to the fact that most women have a height requirement of at least 5'10. Frequently, women have a height cutoff of 6ft regardless of their height. So this establishes that short guys are at a huge disadvantage with women. Not only are short guys at a huge disadvantage with women, they are also at a huge disadvantage in terms of getting respect from their peers. Short guys are mocked by men and women, and aren't taken seriously in the workplace. If a short guy tries to be assertive and wants to be successful, he's labeled as having a napoleon complex. Tall people love to make fun of short people and physically bully and intimidate them. Why do I have to live an unfulfilling life when I can live a happy life as an average height guy without all of the stigma and bull**** that comes with being short? Leg lengthening surgery is a difficult thing but according to this it's possible to fully recovery from it: 

""I started out at 173.5cm

For all those really lazy people who have invaded our community and refuse to read anything before asking questions

•I had my operation on September 26 2006. •I lengthened for exactly two months. •I turned at 0.866mm per day. Every day. •I exercised at least an hour a day. Every day. •I ate like a king, walking normally, but sore for a few days.

I am now 100% normal, stronger and more confident. Ready to conquer the world!

I can run, dance, make love, and body-pop just as well as before. In fact, I think that I am in some respects better because I have straighter legs with slightly bigger muscles than before - and I will be putting that to the test by doing a parachute jump for charity earlier next year, partly to celebrate my success.

My experience in New York confirmed in my mind that I am now 100% recovered from my procedure. I promised myself that I wouldn't write about this unless I really did feel 100% recovered.

My operation was almost exactly two years ago

All that I know

The world is considerably different at 180cm (5'11"") from what is was at 173.5cm (5'8""); the world is considerably better.""

One r/short member pointed out that very few short men have openly professed their love of short women in the way that tall men openly profess their love for tall women over at r/tall.  I think that is probably true.  But

So my question to r/short is - why is that?

I have my own theory.  I suspect that we short guys are socialized to repress our feelings when it comes to women.  This is especially the case in public places.  That is, from openly flirting in public and that crosses over into online behavior.  

I have personally experienced times in social gatherings where I felt like my participation was limited as ""the short guy"" in order to maintain a group cohesion or perhaps to spare the dignity of females who may have to associate with a short man in a public setting (the implication being that [standing next to a short man is humiliating](http://www.shortsupport.org/TheMedia/commercials/yoplait.mov)).  

**Other ways short guys may be discouraged from flirting with women in public:**

**""You looking at my girl
This is the scenario of some guy trying to prove his masculinity by attacking a shorter (but always also smaller) guy.  Notice that this doesn't happen when the short guy has muscles and the other guy thinks he may not be able to win a fight.  

**The head fake
This is when girl sneaks a peak at you

**The overt comment** -
""Forget about it dude

**The nasty look** -
ewww

**The wedding party scenario** - This is basically any boy/girl outing in which arrangements are made to try to find a very short girl to go out so ""the short guy will have someone to talk to"" - the short girl never appreciates being used in this way and so she is especially mean to the short dude during the outing.

**shortness not viewed as an asset** -
Maybe it's just that tall guys talk about their height as a way to flirt

**""Is this guy bothering you?""** - 
This is the scenario where a taller guy swoops in to the conversation while you're talking to a woman because he thinks/realizes that it would be an easy pick-up.  

That's all I can think of right now...but there are probably others.

This is not what women traditionally get celebrated for. We see movies with Disney princesses, and handsome. At the same time, in college especially, we were told that women could do anything. I still think this is true, and I try to prove this in my career all the time. 

I’ve always said that height is a gender issue. Women, and are better than us in every way, I don’t know how that helps our image in society. If we’re always asking to be looked down on in terms of dating, then women will constantly be looked down on in society. It drives me nuts. That’s why I date men who are my height, and it makes me feel extremely femine: able to do all the things men are able to do. It makes me feel strong. That is a modern definition of being a woman and frankly, holding on to all these old notions of male dominance really holds us women back. 
So

1)	For women: Younger women tend to be the ones that will have these extreme cutoffs. I did when I was younger. Why? Because in America, handsome providers. My grandmother was a big influence for me. She told me to go for stability, a work ethic, and an ability to make me laugh.

Dudes of r/short, if you like! The urge to downvote everything in sight will be strong, and I can't stop you, but I do wish you'd lay off of downvoting something solely because you don't like it, because that makes threads a lot more difficult for me to read. But overall, this post is directed to the ladies.

Anyway

I have a pretty massive preference for tall guys. Not tall*er*. Not even normal tall. But *talllllllll*. 

I don't think I was always this way...and, or if my personal ""type"" is solidifying, or something else. 

My dating history kind of goes something like this: I never really thought about height very often growing up. A guy was either cute or not

My first boyfriend was 6'. I think that was pretty random. Then the next one was, my friends and family noticed it, and we'd all joke about how I had a total lady-boner for tall dudes. Still, though, it wasn't a HUGE huge deal, and I kind of saw it as on par with my affection for green eyes--I liked them, but it wasn't a deal maker or breaker. Obviously a lot of other things mattered more.

The next dude was 6'2"", I was like, ""Wait...how tall are you?"", and then I was like, *""WHAT??!""* It seemed ridiculous. Nevertheless, we started dating, I fell in love, believe it or not. 

We were together for so long that 6'5"" started to feel normal. I got so used to the way he looked and how our bodies fit together that a 6' tall man seems completely average to me now. Also, imo) good looks and athletic build, on top of the fact that he was always the tallest person in the room, made him a magnet for attention. I genuinely loved parading around town with him.

Being on this sub has made me start to analyze my motivations and inner workings when it comes to this facet of sexual/romantic attraction. First off

I still have issues though.  Even at ~12% bodyfat and 126 pounds, it's what has been pushing me to get more and more lean.

I loved how ground fighting equalizes size, even though the guys I was sparring against were taller and had longer reach than me I could submit them on the ground.  
  
The pudgy body was replaced by some muscles. I cut my hair really short so no-one could grab it during sparring, you have really nice eyes. Why do you hide them?"" The next day I got contact lenses.

I know how tough it is for you guys, they can make or break your self-image. This might be something you've not thought of. Don't hang around people who are 'play-aggressive' or if there's even a subtle patriarchal dynamic in the group, it's not compatible.

So generally, it lacks precision because it doesn’t tell us anything about how the prejudice works.  Therefore, I have formulated what I believe to be a more descriptive definition of the word.  **Heightism is a gender based socially constructed prejudice which holds that human height should convey social privilege or stigma as enforced systemically through cultural “norms”, media impressions, familial dynamics, etc.**  This definition emphasizes the fact that heightism is an accepted element of our culture; a systemic social prejudice which is not merely limited to the thoughts or actions of a few bad actors.

**I apologize in advance for the wall of text but I hope you will stick with it.**

I have always been short. I was the shortest kid in my year in elementary school and then one of the shortest going forward. But here is the thing; I never really gave it much thought. As I hit my late teens and early twenties and really started dating I was very lucky to be above average in the looks department, a quick sense of humor, a strong work ethic, great active listening skills, and the ability to put people at ease when I interacted with them. I had lots of friends both male and female. I regularly received unsolicited statements from many of my female friends in the vein of “if they weren’t married by 30 that they were coming to steal me away whether I liked it or not”. Certainly not an environment that makes a guy worry about his height. 

As my twenties progressed I had very few problems dating attractive women. One was a dance major from Chicago (2 years), I bagged a naughty librarian! (1 year). Each of these women were 1-3 inches taller than me. Among these past relationships I am a still friends with two of these women and they are really great ladies, we were ultimately just not meant to be. Between these relationships were periods of about a year were I really just wanted to have a good time and meet women without a long term commitment. They were fun times. 

Even though I was successful I still actively worked to improve myself. I hit the gym, cultivated interesting hobbies, volunteered, finished an undergrad (Operations Analysis), finished another one (Accounting), and finished a graduate degree (MBA), and moved up in my career. 

After the end of my relationship with the librarian I took a handful of months to get myself in the right place to date again. I was 28. I had never tried online dating and figured that I was a decent catch so “Why Not!” I spent the effort and time to create a well-written profile. Messaged women with things I noticed from their profile and was generally light and funny. Then crickets. Zero. No responses. I kept at it for a couple of weeks and an attractive girl messaged me back. A few fun exchanges later we were talking via messenger and there seemed to be chemistry. In mid message she stopped and told me that she just realized that I was 5’5”. I was a little surprised as she was 5’2”. She apologized for not noticing it sooner. I don’t do needy so I wished her good luck on her dating adventures. Thereafter, avenue to success. The profile went into the great abyss.

A few weeks later I was in invited to a friend of a friend’s Halloween party. The hostess was a 33-year-old 5’8” brunette

Fast forward five years. That hot hostess is now my fiancé. We live together. I have steadily progressed through my career. I supported her when she decided to go back and finish nursing school. We have a home in a great part of town. We travel and I recently paid for a trip to Europe as part of her graduation present. Neither of us wants children so we are saving more aggressively for retirement. None of this would have happened if I would have let the preference of a stranger on an online dating site color my self worth. 




**So for the short guys reading this here is my advice:**

Hit the gym, but do these things and it will work itself out. If not, then sorry dude, you are not a catch; at any height.




**For the women reading this that are holding out for a 6’1” prince charming

Don’t hold on to those unrealistic expectations too long. Don’t believe me then Google dating for women after 30. Seriously depressing stuff. Ageism for over 30 women is apparently the heightism that men experience in their 20s. 

Also consider the following point.

The girl that brushed me off for my height while online dating

Above average attractiveness, humorous, loyal, caring, supportive, highly educated and applying to PhD programs, financially secure with a great career and a salary just a hair under six figures and growing.

Faced with the same decision at 35




**And...Finally for the women who would gladly date a short guy if he is a catch:**

You are simply awesome! Short, you rock! Seriously. Give me your address and I will be by in a couple minutes to hug you personally. 

Also..please keep letting us short fellas prove our worth based on what we are about and how we treat you and not our stature. I bet you will continue to find a guy that appreciates you in a way that a tall guy never will


**Wow so there have been some interesting takes on my experience and advice.  I will really add only one more thing and leave it where it stands.**

So solving all of the societal ills of a short man’s existence was a little outside of the scope of a post describing my personal experience and the advice I would lend. However as it was mentioned, lowered earnings potential, stereotyping, and derisions like “Napoleon Complex”? Absolutely.  Do women? Who else?  Do you actively support their causes?  Have you actively started your own cause?

So lets take that down the rabbit hole.

Let’s assume that /r/short somehow captures the attention of the public at whole. Let’s assume that brilliant arguments are made about the injustices short men face. The government

It doesn’t make any sense to wait for some sort of overriding societal change to make the best of the situation. My life is now. So is yours. I am not going to squander years in the hopes that this happens. Especially when I have the power to control many of the outcomes of my life. 

So do you.

I tend to be the kind of person to believe statistical data over personal anecdotal evidence but in this case my own experiences differ quite dramatically from stuff I briefly found online.

Excluding dwarfs, I know a guy who is 6'10"", another who is 6'8"", and a handful of guys around 6'6"" - all 8 inches or more above the average. I know /r/tall is a collection of basically the tallest people around but they still have a number of individual members in the 6'10""-7'2"" range. If height was normally distributed then there should be just as many guys who are 4'10"" as there are 6'10"" and that just doesn't seem accurate. 

I could obviously be wrong but is it possible that height is *not* normally distributed? If it's not normally distributed then it's most likely that the median height is actually slightly below the mean height and that there could be a fair amount of bunching happening in the slightly below-average range.

In my experiences, however optimistic it may sound, isn't it more about your personality? I've found that if I appear confident, personable, and active, I can *gather* the respect that the tall guy may get initially.

1.) Yes
2.) This is not a ""throwaway"". I've posted on reddit a while back

Okay, starting from (in my opinion) weakest to strongest.

1.) I don't think that short guys are not given chances to lead or be dominnant. I know that this is just purely speculation. People treat me with great respect and often show deference to me. I am pretty sure that this is not the average experience though. I do however

2.)Short guys can build muscle so easily. So easily. It is so much easier to fill out a five foot frame than a six foot one. You can get so muscular so fast its insane.

3.) You can do more with that muscle. Body weight exercises are so much easier and the heights (ha) you can achieve are so much greater. You can lift 2x your weight much easier.  You can maneuver  and climb so much better (there was this one Japanese ninja show that had the contestants do insane things in order to win and the things it demands from the body can pretty much only be achieved by a short man).

3a.) Which means you can handle Gs better. You can be a fighter pilot or operate the next awesome sort of machine our brains event. You have a low center of gravity if you're into grappling.

4.) You can endure longer. You will be able to run for longer than someone taller than you. This is incredibly valuable in my opinion.

5.) You need less. Generally speaking

6.) You're more comfortable. Planes, the list goes on and on. Things are built to the lowest possible specification to save money. I have never seen a tall person comfortable on an aircraft, even in first class.

7.) You live longer. I think this one speaks for itself. How cool is that?

Being short doesn't define me

I get the impression that a lot of you guys are in your 20s and are a little bent because you think it's hard to attract women. I'm 42 so maybe I can offer a little advice because age theoretically imparts wisdom.

I don't believe for a second that there aren't millions of women out there who do find short guys attractive. I've never had a problem dating women throughout my life. I've dated short, who cares? There are plenty who won't date guys for a million other reasons besides height.

Women are attracted to confidence, confidence. Get that confidence however you need to but don't base it on how many women you attract or think you should be attracting. Every guy who does that, short, medium or tall, inevitably comes across as desperate and/or not confident. Be good at something else. Athletics, your job, a hobby, truly believe in it

Hi r/short



The mod team just had our 3rd mod meeting


~~We've talked about a lot of stuff but the topic that was brought up the most was the recent influx of negative posts/comments towards members of r/tall.~~


~~After long discussion, r/tall.~~


~~I think that it is the best thing to do and it will prevent a lot of negativity and hate between the subreddits.~~

~~I have a lot of respect for the mods at r/tall and I believe that they also don't tolerate similar behavior towards our subreddit but even if they allow it


~~I understand that some people get upset and they need to let the steam off but fighting fire with fire won't solve anything. So


In other news

The idea is pretty simple. Every month, making insightful posts that start discussions/help short people in a certain way, etc.). 

I believe that this will give a competitive feel to the subreddit and bring the quality of posts/comments up. It will encourage the users to post more and make the subreddit a little bit more fun (and unique

I also think that it will make the job of mods much easier since readers will be reporting bad posts and comments. 


Unfortunately

Hopefully I will fix it in next 2 weeks and then find another way to improve our subreddit. 



This is it.

Let me know your opinions on our decisions and also your suggestions.

Maybe my family and friends think something about it but since I didn't make a big deal about it it doesn't seem really important to them. Again even if I don't talk much about it they know I'm a bit insecure about my height, no need to lie about it. Most of us on this subreddit probably are. I think that's the main thing, dont even try to hide them and get trapped in a spider of petty lies.

My insoles are 3 cm (like 1.2 inches I think


To sum it up, wear them when you meet new people to make a better impression. I know that may sound like surrendering to heightism but let's face it, being short is not an attractive feature.

I'm working on a book on Height and collection of data regarding Heightism with my AtEyeLevel blog.

""Height Shaming"" will be one of the chapters. Think of Fat Shaming

This post from Geoffry Arnold's TheSocialComplex Tumblr blog comes to mind when thinking of Height Shaming. It's about a 5'5 guy in Scandinavia who is taunted due to his height - http://thesocialcomplex.tumblr.com/post/25960243507/heartbreaking-taunts-at-midsummer

One story about this chick that I'd liked for a long time; We only hung out during the summers but I had liked this girl for years and from 14-18 we just kind of joked around and flirted. But when we turned 18 that summer it got more physical too. Anyways, we just drifted apart). This sucked for 2 reasons; 1. Who knows, that's probably true. I never thought of it like that but yeah, I can agree that being at a party and standing up sucks when all the guys are 6'0 and even the women are taller than you because they're wearing heels. 
2. I feel like my height doesn't get brought up too much because I'm pretty athletic so I'm not scrawny so when people acknowledge the fact that I'm small hurts a lot more. 

(3) Also, when she said that it was like a total confidence booster for a little- even though I played it off like I didn't care. I'm not one of those guys who finds it easy to insult women and I'm too much of a pussy to insult girls I like to 'be the bad boy' so there was literally nothing I could say as a retort/reply.


I'm not ashamed of being short but it's definitely something I'd change if it could magically happen. And I wouldn't even ask to be like 6'2. I feel like 5'9 5'10 is the perfect height if you're a guy. Tall enough that when a chick is next to you in heels you're both a roughly the same height. 

Like I said before, although I'm the same height as other people who are talked about as being short so no doubt people talk about me being a short guy when I'm not around.

And as heightism is a prejudice which is part of a pervasive social construct which says that shorter people are inherently inferior to taller people - we all start off believing this myth to some extent.  When I was very young, because I regarded it as natural and I never framed it as a type of prejudice.  Looking back

However, I was introduced to the concept of ""heightism"" for the first time.  

But though a lot of things happened which confirmed my suspicions about heightism

----

I had a high GPA and I did pretty well on my LSAT and so I got into seven of the ten Law Schools I applied to as my undergraduate experience wound down.  As a result, as well as several professors and the Dean of Admissions.  

So, and two lawyers from the sponsoring law firm (tall guys - maybe 6'2"" and 6'4"").  Some of us have glasses of wine or plates of finger food in our hands, but everyone is socializing and talking about our plans for the future.  I'm the shortest male there, but I'm not really thinking about height - everyone seems pretty nice and I'm starting to think that this might be the school for me.  

Then, etc.  So, here is the kicker:  He shakes everyone's hand in the circle, but he stops right before he gets to me.  That is, he shakes the hand of the guy standing right next to me, but then his eyes glance right through me and he steps back...not acknowledging me, even though it seems like he saw me.   

At this point, I could sort of feel myself shrinking away - trying to slip outside of the circle as not to press the issue or insert myself into somewhere that I wasn't invited.   

But as I was shuffling away from the group

**THAT** was the moment that I realized that heightism is a serious social problem.  I was aware of heightism by that point, but his mind was on social autopilot and so he saw me and made a snap judgement about my presence -  *""not important""* - and I apparently agreed with him because I accept his judgment and tried to slink away; as we were both socialized in a heightist environment.  It took the look on a pair of tall guy's faces to wake me up to what I already understood.  While I should have barked ""Excuse me, Sir!"", instead my mind made a normative assessment of the situation based on how I'd been socialized throughout my childhood; coming to the conclusion that ""Geoff, you're short, and so you can't blame people for treating you like that"".

But after seeing the look on two tall guy's faces, but I don't even remember if I smiled or looked him in the eye or anything.  My mind was racing and I probably looked like a zombie as I was limply shaking his hand.  It's like my whole world was falling apart in that moment even though I'd been treated poorly because of my height hundreds of times before that.    

The main difference now was that I linked the experience to a widespread social prejudice which goes unaddressed in our society but poisons the potential of promising individuals for something that is beyond our control.  Short guys are socialized to accept poor treatment that other guys would never tolerate as a matter of course.  And it was then that I suddenly realized that I probably wouldn't have even been admitted to the school if the Dean had met me in person

It goes without saying that I didn't attend that Law School.

1361987040.0,19c6mx,My opinion on comparing heightism and sexism.,irbananaking,28,17,23,"Why did this get NSFWed?

I've seen comments by short women on /r/short comparing the **discrimination of short men to sexism**. I think this is not a good comparison.

There have been studies proving that women do get paid less on average than men. Why? Because they're comparing men with women in general. Not men and women in the same career with the same education working in the same place and getting the same results. 


They get paid equally. If women were actually paid 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes, men would be the ones with job issues.


So I see users with the pink flares always saying that heightism isn't a big deal and say ""whatever, may millions, of people who support feminist movements. I don't think there are more (maybe not even) 20,000 people who fight against heightism.**

If I **joke about hating women and were to update my twitter or Facebook status's about how much I hate women and how disgusting they were, BOOM! I'm a superficial asshole. It's genetic that they have smaller breasts, they didn't choose it. I'm not supposed to judge girls because of their body. It's not like it's a genetic thing in a man's brain that makes them find large breasts attractive so it's clearly not a good enough excuse. However, compare that to men's heights. It's totally cool to say that a girl would never date a short guy... plus its a genetic thing.**


I don't have anything against women and I think they should be treated equally to men. I think everyone should be treated equally regardless of height, sexual preference, etc.

-Vans has unisex sneakers that are nice for summertime.  
-Fry is a rather expensive company but also have great leather footwear for people with small feet.  
-Large companies like New Balance and Nike will cover your athletic footwear.

In comparison to being tall, which hurts because I am competitive by nature. People equate competition to aggression when you're short. A lot of the negatives stem from others' unconscious actions, which is indicative of how they interpret me. I'm the oldest of my three siblings and people often assume I'm the second youngest (my youngest sibling is 8 years younger than me so it's impossible to get that one wrong). I've been rejected by women solely based on my height, even by some who were shorter than me. Once I had a girl who was 4'11"" - 5' 0"" ask me what it was like to be short. Being drunk, I couldn't do anything but laugh. At this point I feel it is safe to assume that if she's taller than me, it's a no.

We're growing in numbers! Our subreddit is slowly but surely gaining people and we plan to keep it that way. We are working our hardest to ensure that all content is fresh, and relevant.
