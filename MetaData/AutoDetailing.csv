Now seems a good as a time as any to make a proper list of what people need. 

For some reason

I will mention that this is just my personal list that I use to detail cars. I have used many different products and these are what I feel the top players in each category. If you like other products that's fine

Some of the products mention here will not work for some casual ""detailers"" simply because of the size that they are in so just be aware of that. There are definitively alternatives to some of the gallons sizes products that I mention below.

Third,000 words and it's 30 pages in word. I just like to mention that hear instead of someone saying that I’m “sneaky” or what not. Like I said, this idea didn’t even come up until I already started to write this article so just to be clear my main intent in this article is to inform and not to make a measly dollar off a $30 compound you bought. I also will not change my opinion on what I like just because [Detailed Image](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com) does not carry it; that would be cheating you out of a great product. If I don’t make a dollar off Brown Royal or the microfiber towels you bought so be it, at least you have a product that works and that is my main goal with this article.

Now

These are the following types of products I will be listing today (in alphabetical order):

* All Purpose Cleaner

* Bucket

* Clay

* Clay Lube

* Compound

* Drying Towel

* Dual Action Polisher

* Dual Action Polisher Backing Plate

* Engine Detail Brush

* Exterior Trim Dressing

* Extractor

* Grit Guard

* Interior Protectant

* Leather

* Leather Brush

* Metal Polish

* Microfiber Towels

* Pads

* Polish

* Rinseless Wash

* Sealant

* Spray Bottles &amp; Sprayers

* Spray Wax

* Stain Removal

* Swirl Finder Light

* Tire Brush

* Tire Dressing Applicator

* Tire/Wheel &amp; Engine Cleaner

* Tire &amp; Engine Shine

* Wash

* Washing Media

* Wax

* Wax Applicators

* Wheel Brush

* Window Cleaner

Alright

**All Purpose Cleaner**

[Meguiar's All Purpose Cleaner Plus D103](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Meguiars-M43/All-Purpose-Cleaner-Plus-D103-P385/128-oz-S1/)

http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/4125/megsd103lrgbc8.jpg

An All Purpose Cleaner is more commonly known as APC. The specific one I am referring to is called APC+. APC+ is exactly what it says (for the most part) which is a general cleaner. For example


**Bucket**

http://imagethumbnails.milo.com/024/917/651/trimmed/24917120_28175651_trimmed.jpg

You can generally find this bucket at Home Depot. I really like this bucket because of its measurements, and it also fits the Grit Guard perfectly. There really is not much to say about a bucket, but I really do like this bucket because of the previous things I mentioned. Let's stop talking about buckets now.


**Clay**

[Mothers California Gold Clay Bar System](http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-07240-California-Gold-System/dp/B0002U2V1Y) 

http://image.eurotuner.com/f/images/24969103/eurp_0908_08_z%2Bmothers_clay_bar%2Bfull_view.jpg

This is a good general clay that you can also buy at any auto parts store. I like this clay because it is easy to mold and it's not too soft so it doesn't just pass over embedded particles and it's not too soft that it will destroy your paint. Let me point out though, but I rather just keep this simple for now.


**Clay Lube**

[Dodo Juice Born Slippy Clay Lube Concentrate](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Dodo-Juice-M35/Born-Slippy-Clay-Bar-Lube-P326/250-ml-S1/)

http://www.cleanyourcar.co.uk/images/uploads/watermarked/dodo-born-slippy-conc.jpg

While the Mothers Clay Bar System comes with clay lube


**Compound** 

[Meguiar's Ultra-Cut Compound M105](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Meguiars-M43/Ultra-Cut-Compound-M105-P388/32-oz-S1/)

http://www.detailersdomain.com/assets/images/megm105.jpg

[Menzerna Super Intensive Polish SI 1500](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Menzerna-M10/Super-Intensive-Polish-PO83-P124/32-oz-S1/)

http://www.detailersdomain.com/assets/images/menzernasi1500pt.jpg

[Meguiar's Foam Cut Compound M101](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Meguiars-M43/Foam-Cut-Compound-M101-P715/32-oz-S1/)

http://www.detailing.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/m/e/meg-m101.jpg

[Menzerna Fast Gloss 400 Compound](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Menzerna-M10/Fast-Gloss-400-Compound-P688/16-oz-S1/)

http://www.oldetownautospa.ca/assets/images/menzernafg400qt.jpg

As you can see I have listed 4 different products. For the most part they all do the same thing which is remove severe defects in the paint. For the Meguiar's side you have M105 and M101 whereas on the Menzerna side you have SIP 1500 and FG400. M105 compares to the SIP 1500, M105, SIP 1500 and FG400. I could have added Menzerna Power Gloss, but I feel that that particular compound is almost not needed any more since some of these compounds cut so well and finish much, much better.

Also, I am not saying acquire all 4. You should be perfectly find having one product of each brand, just know the limitations of each specific product you are choosing. For example, if you choose FG400 make sure you know that it won't remove scratches as much as SIP 1500.


**Drying Towel** 

[Mothers Microfiber Performance Drying Towel](http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Microfiber-Performance-Drying-Towel/dp/B001UJB8X8)

http://www.carid.com/images/mothers/car-care/155300.jpg

This is my favorite towel to dry my car with after I ""flood the car"" with the hose and use a leaf blower to dry the majority of the water off. This microfiber towel has a waffle weave which is designed to absorb water. This towel also has a foam core in the middle of the towel so it absorbs much more water than a regular towel. I have used the guzzler and I believe that this towel out performs that towel. The only thing I would improve on is that I wish this towel was a tad bit bigger. I will note that since this towel has a foam core

* Get an air compressor. Great for drying off vehicles and getting in all the crevices/seals, etc.

* Dog hair inside you car? Get a pumice stone (that are used for pedicures) and brush the hair away into a shop vac nozzle. It pulls the hair right out and you instantly suck it all up in the vac.

* Clean glass last. Go in horizontal motions on the interior

* Before a client picks up a car sit in the drivers seat and look around. Take note of any obvious smudges

* Use Chemical Guys Black on Black on the wheel-well plastics. It will make the wheels pop with a nice dark background. (Also works great on black trim, etc.)

* Use Nanoskin pads instead of claybar. MUCH faster and cost efficient. (Claybar can still be good for small

* Apply dots of polish or sealant on sections of the car. That way you can keep working without stopping and reloading the pad every few minutes.

* Ask clients about any areas they think need special attention when they drop the car off. Some people might care more about the stain that you got out of the carpet and couldn't care less if you did a great job correcting the paint!

* If it ain't dirty

The results: http://imgur.com/a/86rIz

Washed and clayed using medium grade nanoskin.  

Compounded with Menzerna PG1000. Followed with Menzerna SF4000.
Waxed it with Meguiar's Ultimate Paste Wax.

The whole job took nearly 8 hours of nonstop working.

With the help of a lot of great people on this sub (especially /u/Baconzjews11

I am focusing on getting a solid wash kit as the start of my process. I will then expand the kit to include leather care, and wax. I understand that claying is a big part of the wash process but I wanted to spread my cost a little and decided I would add the clay kit a bit later.

Thanks to this subreddit I was able to fix up my moms 99 Buick after she had scraped against the garage.  

I had been away at school and my first words when I came home was ""what did you do to the car?"". Never really got a full answer but she scraped the side of the garage while backing out somehow. 

I a meguirs clay bar kit, it was useless), and meguirs scratch x 2.0. after cleaning up I clayed the area, buffed it with a microfiber pad, scratch x, and a good amount of elbow grease, then wiped off the haze with some more quik detailer.

1323499716.0,n77q2,Beginners guide to detailing products: the bare minimum supplies.,spellrm,23,3,19,"So I haven't seen much activity here in a while, and I was always looking for a way to save money. So here is what you need to get good results for minimal investment:

**Washing:**

The first step is always going to be to wash the car. Many people use a bucket, it is often times putting swirls in the paint, making the paint look dull over time. The quality of soap is important too. To minimize the swirls you put into the paint, here is what you want:

* Two Home Depot 5 gallon buckets. (Yes two)
* Your choice between: a microfiber chenille mitt, a [grout sponge](http://www.lowes.com/pd_109653-962-K-28P_0__?catalogId=10051&amp;productId=1002329&amp;UserSearch=grout+sponge&amp;Ntt=grout+sponge&amp;N=0&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;rpp=24).~~ EDIT: I've witnessed the grout sponge induce a small amount of marring since writing this. I recommend everyone use a microfiber or sheepskin mitt. A microfiber mitt can be had for cheap at Target (Vroom brand) and they work great. I never use sheepskin but if you do, make sure it is 100%. 
* For soap, it is great soap. I use the [Gold Class](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-G7101-Class-Shampoo-Gallon/dp/B00068OU7U/ref=sr_1_5?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323492149&amp;sr=1-5) soap, but really any version will work.

**Drying:**

Drying the car is the worst part in my opinion. Whatever you do

* [The Supreme Guzzler](http://www.amazon.com/Supreme-Guzzler-Waffle-Weave-Cobra/dp/B000BC976K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323491902&amp;sr=8-1).

Now I know I said this was a budget list, it won't scratch the paint. Worth every penny.

**Claying:**

A clay bar is used to remove embedded particulates that are stuck to the paint. This includes, and asphalt. Once clayed, the paint will feel silky smooth like glass. This step is crucial to do before any type of wax is put on. You don't want to be rubbing particulates into the paint while waxing. A Meguiar's or Mother's clay kit can be bought locally. Both are virtually (or perhaps actually) the same.

* [Meguir's Clay Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-G1016-Smooth-Surface-Clay/dp/B00063X7KG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323497232&amp;sr=8-1)
* [Mother's Clay Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-07240-California-Gold-System/dp/B0002U2V1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364443230&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mothers+clay+bar)

These kits are great because they come with plenty of clay (seriously

**Wax:**

The final step. This step is fun and rewarding, and then some waxes I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. Anything from Turtlewax, stay away! Just overall horrible quality. For OTC stuff, I like:

* [Meguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Generation-Tech-18-Ounce-Liquid/dp/B0002UQATS/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323497624&amp;sr=1-1)

Goes on easy

Another wax

* [Collinite #845](http://www.amazon.com/Collinite-Liquid-Insulator-Wax-Combo/dp/B005ZUMLV6/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364443411&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=collinite+845)

If you haven't been keeping track of cost yet

Remember

* Wheel brush and tire shine if you like it.
* APC = All purpose cleaner. I prefer Simple Green.
* Glass cleaner. I prefer Stoner's Invisible Glass.
* Some more microfiber towels. Costco has some OK ones (just make sure you wash them first with a light detergent).

1361069628.0,18o7hc,What to ask yourself before having your car detailed.,rlc1042,20,4,3,"Being informed about service you are acquiring is always a good start

First to simply answer the question of what is car detailing? It is more than just a simple quick once over at your neighborhood express car wash. Your basics are covered your car is washed, the difference in having a professional detail your car and you yourself attempting this task are very different. A professional will use multistage operations in order to get your car to the brand new brilliance and shine that it had the day you got it, by using high quality products and time, your cars inside and outside will be brought back to showroom standards. 

How often does a full detail last? Unlike a simple wash that will leave your car looking great for a few days and then wash off

Sealants: what exactly is this and do I need it? The simple answer is yes! Having a sealant applied to your car basically gives you the glass like shine of a new car. Most professionals use a resin or synthetic wax

Lastly knowing what to expect in a car detailing package. Not all packages are standard and a professional will most likely need to see your car in person to address what, wash, wax and an inside detail will be your base. Seasonal treatments are always available which will protect you Summer through Winter, with UV rays, harsh cold and rain to snow and tree sap. Depending on when you have your car detailed a professional will be able to tell you what your car needs.

1376781925.0,1kkr0f,"Review: AMMO Foam, Hydrate, Mousse, Big Wheel Brush, Microfiber Towels; Dodo Juice Supernatual Wookie's Fist",18,"If you've been following my posts about the products from [Autogeek](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1kedd2/the_latest_shipment/) and [AMMONYC](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1kjsfp/op_delivers/) then you'll know that review has been a long time coming. For a gallery of the post-wash go [here](http://imgur.com/a/BkDoH).

* AMMO Foam: Very thick, do not underestimate the thickness of this soap. The lubricity of this stuff is outstanding, it feels like there is almost nothing between the wash mitt and the paint. It's cleansing power is second to none and it smells good too! I must admit, when I first poured it out into the measuring cup I thought ""Holy shit, this stuff might be radioactive!"" I added one ounce to approximately four gallons of water using a grit guard in a Lowes bucket. Amazing stuff.

* [Dodo Juice Supernatural Mitt A.K.A ""Wookies Fist""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1kkhi2/teaser_video_of_ammo_foam_with_wookies_mitt/): ""Um... where did all of my water go?"" That statement sums up this mitt pretty much. It sucks up at least half a gallon of water with each dip in the bucket. The fur is outstanding at holding particulate and dirt from the paint and it saved me time and water. I use to do one panel at a time with the microfiber mitt and then wash that said

* AMMO Big Wheel Brush: Sturdy comes to mind when I picked it up. Very heavy, and I believe him. I think this thing might be ""buy it for life.""

* AMMO Hydrate: One-of-a kind, if my vehicle isn't filthy Hydrate can be used with a microfiber towel to clean it. The instructions recommend that you rinse the vehicle down and then dry with a towel with Hydrate. I'll definitely be repurchasing this.

* AMMO Microfiber Towels: 300 GSM towels, and not wring the towel out once. They came in a pack of six and I used three. One for drying, one for glass, and one for claying the car.

* AMMO Interior Conditioner (Mousse): Another outstanding product. I cleaned with leather seats with Lexol according to directions and then let them sit for about 15 minutes to dry. Opening the bottle I was immediately greeted with the smell of leather and a cream color substance that was creamy in nature. I applied it with a microfiber applicator from Mother's and let it sit for about five minutes before touching it. It definitely restored some of the suppleness to the leather and gave it a nice slick finish. Not so slick that I would slide out of the seat

Overall I am very impressed with all of Larry's products. When the bottle says ""Fanatically manufactured in the USA""

If there is anything I missed or if you have any questions or want more photos of the AMMO products

That damn soap... holy shit is it green...

My silent partner has asked me for an extremely high level floor plan by the end of the week to reference in a meeting with his investors. He just wants square footage and basic layout.

I'm completely clueless as to the most efficient way to lay out a shop and would love some advice. He asked me for a minimum requirement and then something more creative.

I'm thinking the minimum requirement is about 1500 square feet with an extremely small customer lobby and restroom

The nice-to-have is 1800-2000sq-ft with a very small lobby, with the rest of the space dedicated to workspace with a separated washbay. 4 bays including the wash bay would be ideal.

The ultimate wishlist is closer to 2500+ square feet, reception desk and some product display shelves, with some extra wide double doors and enough space to display a car in the lobby. There would be a restroom just past the customer lobby, a storage/break room, and a 4 bay shop.

Here is a little background on our business plan/approach. 

We're located in an *extremely* affluent area with disposable income dripping at the seams. I followed a new 458 up the highway this morning. There are currently no detailing businesses in the area with the skill, some of which I already have strong relationships with, and several high end new &amp; used car dealers. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Aston, and Porsche are all within 20 minutes.

We plan to pursue partnerships with these businesses and market ourselves by pounding pavement within the enthusiast community. We focus on earning a reputation by the quality of work we do and word-of-mouth

That's a high level idea. We plan to spend the summer writing the business/marketing plan and building the website

So

So far

* Shop Vac
* Water blades
* Microfiber cloths (x30 or so)
* Rags for other stuff
* Waffle cloths for drying as well (they are awesome!)
* Applicator pads
* A good wax/polish
* Car soap (waxed)
* Dish soap (for removing wax)
* Spray wax
* Clay bar
* Glass cleaner
* All Purpose cleaner / degreaser
* Interior shampoo
* Degreaser
* Vinyl/Rubber/Plastic dressing
* Tire dressing
* Some sort of leather care
* Air freshener
* Chrome polish
* Wheel cleaner / wheel acid
* Steel wool
* Buckets
* Rubber hair brush
* Brushes of various sizes
* Various buffer pads (he has a buffer)

What am I missing out? I'm not going to be doing anything crazy to the cars. Just basic refreshing

Any input would be much appreciated. Even just tips

I'm not a professional detailer

Here's how I detail a car (I own a black car):

1. Take the car to my friend's house because he has a garage that's not full of junk and I've placed all my detailing stuff on his shelves there.  

2. Cycle my friend's water softener.  He has well water that's otherwise hard and would leave water spots.  (And yes, then closing the garage door and turning on a large [true HEPA air filter](http://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-50250-S-99-97%25-Round-Purifier/dp/B00007E7RY) (Home Depot has a black version right now) to remove all dust from the air inside the garage.  

3. Wash the car wheels and car using the [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBo76v2je44) (or three) [bucket method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-M2Cq0RNTs) (see also [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqdEVtOPKAM)) (I like to use [this grit-guard](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grit-Guard-Insert-Yellow/dp/B001SICVAU) ([double-pack](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grit-Guard-Insert-Pack/dp/B008DJQR3Y)), I spray the wheels with aluminum-safe wheel cleaner.  

4. Finish the wheel cleaning while the car is still soapy (depending on the heat and how fast the water will dry).  I use that [Bleche-Wite Tire Cleaner](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Magic-Bleche-Wite-Tire-Cleaner/dp/B006T0F8MA) (careful to not get it on the paint nor aluminum or magnesium wheels) applied with curved foam pads

5. Rinse away the soapy water with a hose with no attachments

6. Fully dry the car using [super-absorbant shammies](http://www.amazon.com/The-Absorber-Synthetic-Drying-Chamois/dp/B0000AY69V).  

7. Turn off the air filter to prevent it from pushing air out of the garage

Note - *if necessary


(*This is a good time to get something to eat.*)


8. Clay the entire vehicle using [Maguiar's clay kit](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Smooth-Surface-Clay-Kit/dp/B00063X7KG).  

9. Apply (&amp; buff/remove excess) [Maguiar's #7 Mirror Glaze](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Mirror-Professional-Glaze-liquid/dp/B0002UQAM0)

10. Apply (&amp; buff/remove excess) either [Maguiar's #26 Yellow Liquid Wax](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Hi-Tech-Yellow-Wax-ounces/dp/B0002SQZR2) OR [Maguiar's Ultimate Liquid Wax](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Ultimate-Liquid-Wax-oz/dp/B004HCM9H4).  

11. If the Ultimate Wax (which is synthetic) was used

12. I might also apply detailer wax spray like Ultimate Detailer by Maguiar's.  

13. Apply tire-wet to the tires.  I use [Maguiers Endurance](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Endurance-Tire-Dressing-Trigger/dp/B004HCM9GK) along with [foam applicators](http://www.amazon.com/Eagle-One-5010602-Tire-Swipes/dp/B00062Z2M8).  

14.  Come back to the car hours later and check it for any imperfections. 


I use a cheap dual-action random orbital buffer (10"") for all of this.  

There's more I'd like to add but I have to step away right now.  I'll update when I can.  

I'd love to hear feedback.  The one thing I haven't experience in yet is polishing.

Gold class wash
Smooth surface clay kit
Cleaner Wax
NXT gen tech wax 2.0
and possibly Ultimate quick wax

My real question is how often is each step done?
1. I'm assuming your wouldn't have to clay your car as often as any of the other steps?
2. Do you polish every time you wax of if its just needed when full detail?
3. I guess which steps are most important? persay get away with a wash/wax and or quick detail?

2009 Honda Accord metallic gray daily driver. Car has been washed about 2x a month by car was but haven't been truly happy with them. Water beads on the car but is slightly rough when running hand across. I have had experience detailing cars in high school auto shop so have a pretty decent understanding how to do everything just need advise on how often.

Thanks a ton for advise and will post pictures asap.

Edit:
Alright guys thanks a ton for all the info,during and after. Once I finished washing and drying it started to thunder so decided to do a quick spray wax. Rain let up a few mins later and ended up just drying it again and did full NXT wax..

Well today all the polishing supplies I ordered came in and I decided I was going to give it a shot.

http://imgur.com/a/FG8E6

On the first test spot shown in the album I tried using Meguiar's M105 with the Meguiar's yellow polishing pad and I followed that with Meguiar's M205 and the Meguiar's beige finishing pad. The correction was minimal and I didn't even take a picture of it. 

I taped off another test spot and this time tried using the M105 with the maroon cutting pad and the M205 with the yellow polishing pad. So much better. The 50-50 shots are of that test spot.


The pictures aren't really great... it's tough to hold the spotlight with one hand and take a picture with the other. In some spots there is still some cloudiness

It got dark as I was finishing up so I don't have any complete shots of the finished hood right now but I will update the album tomorrow when it's light and I get some pictures. I was just so excited about how great it turned out that I couldn't wait to make a post.

EDIT: It's light out! Though very cloudy. Added some wide shots of the finished product to the album. I didn't really bother with any closeups... it's still not perfect. All the scratches are gone but it's still a LITTLE bit cloudy and then there's spots where the paint has been taken off from bugs that were never removed.

My wife and I live in the Mid-West and just purchased a 2013 Ford Explorer Limited. I really wanted Black but decided to go with Dark Grey since it is a tad easier to keep up with! 

I will not act like I know what I am doing when it comes to Auto Detailing. I want to get into a routine for keeping up with the new SUV in order to keep it looking good through winter and summer. 

I have limited experience washing cars throughout my life and do not know all of the steps to produce a great finish. I understand the basics of pre-soak, wax... but I do not understand all of the techniques. I am overwhelmed by all of the products available on AutoGeek... things for washing, certain brushes for wheels, certain wash mitts, drying rags, waxing products, interior

My Explorer has black leather interior so I would like to keep that in good condition as well. All of your tips are appreciated. I took a look at the following resources on this sub and elsewhere:

* [Bare Minimum Supplies](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/n77q2/beginners_guide_to_detailing_products_the_bare/)
* [Massive Auto Detailing Product List](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1d646c/the_massive_auto_detailing_product_list/)
* [AutoGeek Detailing Tips](http://www.autogeek.net/detailingtips.html)

I am trying to do my research just overwhelmed by all the information, etc. I want to get started building a kit and the beginners guide looks like a great start... I also want to learn proper technique and process (from start to finish). I know some people use high pressure wash while others recommend garden hose can work fine.

The beginners guide here is a good intro for supplies needed but does not go into much of the technique (2-bucket method, wheels, different brushes and tools, interior... including leather).

**TL;DR** - I am a noob. Please help me understand the products I need for a nice beginning detail and the process I should follow.

So the side mirror trim on my E46 BMW was super faded. I can't fault the car

So I set out to restore these trim pieces. Forever Black is pretty much one-of-a-kind in this market. All other trim products are just silicone and oils to make the trim look black for a short time before wearing off. However Forever Black is a dye system that actually dyes the plastic black. 

Here is how it came out: [Result](http://i.imgur.com/sKHFH2G.jpg?1)

**Review**: The kit comes with a cleaner concentrate and the bottle of dye. The dye bottle claims that one coat can restore the trim, it wasn't that easy. It took eight applications (once every 20 minutes) to achieve the final result. Another negative is the applicator that comes attached to the bottle. Do not use it. At all. Use a foam paint brush. The good: although I had to apply way more than two coats, it does do what it says it does. No harsh fumes or anything either which is good. I also have a TON of the stuff left over, even after doing both trim pieces 8 times each. I'd say this product is worth the $15 and the few hours it took me to complete the process. I give this product 3/5 stars.

**Back on Topic**: My recent order to expand my kit included the [Lexol Leather Cleaner, Lexol Leather Conditioner, Vinylex (can be used on interior, exterior trim, wheels, etc), and a couple nice product application sponges.

When I opened the kit I noticed that there was an extremely minor leak near the cap on the Lexol Leather Cleaner. The bottle was undamaged

I figured I would contact Amazon and let them know about the issue and see if they could send a replacement Lexol Leather Cleaner bottle. I even sent the URL for the Leather Cleaner ($7.00) that would be a suitable replacement. 

Amazon went above and beyond my expectations and sent a complete replacement Lexol Kit via overnight shipping (should arrive tomorrow). No questions asked. No hassle. No need to return the current kit or provide proof of damage. I have always been impressed by Amazon's customer service but this was even above and beyond my expectations.

**TL;DR** - ordered a [$23 Lexol Leather Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZBPXGS/ref=shptrk_scth) from Amazon. The Lexol Leather Cleaner bottle had an extremely minor leak.

I purchased her a newer model Ford Explorer with Metallic Tri-Coat White paint and Polished Aluminum Rims. My questions are:

1. What should I use to wash the vehicle with? Dish soap or ""car wash"" soap?

2. Does polishing really do anything? or am I just wasting money?

3. If it does do anything what kind should I use on my car?

4. Will hand polishing it have the same effect as using a buffer?

5. Should I use spray wax or bottle wax?

6. Again what kind for the vehicle I purchased?

7. Also should I remove and buff by hand or should I use a buffer?

8. How do I clean the wheels to make them look great and protect them from oxidation

9. Is there any absolute DO NOTs to washing/detailing a vehicle?

* **Clay Bar Kit**
* **Wax**
* **Leather Care**

These basic items will help me expand my basic kit. I will now be able to remove surface contaminants with the clay bar kit and finalize the wash with a nice wax. The leather cleaner and conditioner will also add a nice touch to the interior and keep my leather looking new.

My secret? S.O.S pads (Which is basically just steel wool presoaked in soap) 

I figured I'd grab some quick pictures while I did it last night

Step 1: remove anything off the rim if you are worried about damaging it (I pulled off my center caps and trim ring prior to the pictures because I was mounting the tires first)

Step 2: Spray the tire down with water (Cold water is fine in most cases

Step 3: Wet the S.O.S Pad, it's totally fine to scrub with a bit of pressure, unless it's 'raised, outlined' white lettering, in which case it is easier to tear, so just be careful and do more, light passes instead.

EDIT: To clarify, in white and the inside is black. As they get older they do tend to become easy to tear if you scrub too hard.

Step 4: Rinse the tire off. You'll probably notice if they were really bad a few small spots that need gone over.

I have a jeep wrangler with 6"" of lift and 35"" mud tires and I'm trying to get it looking pretty. I often go awhile between off roading so during those times I want it clean. 

First what would you all recommend for cleaning bedliner? The floor is bedlined and it is really dirty. Pressure washing just makes it look faded and old even though its clean. Obviously it isn't going to be perfect since its the floor but something to restore the original black color would be awesome.

Second the mud terrain tires are very knobby and I'm having trouble finding a brush to get into the bumps on the sidewall. Any recommendations on a deeper brush? My local auto parts stores don't carry anything that fits well. 

And lastly is there any waxes or finish products that will help reduce scratching from light branches? I'm painting her soon and anything that will help would be good. I'm thinking about buying a powered buffer to get the little scratches out if it'll help.

The wax applies and wipes off easily.  I only used a small amount to do the car, so I suspect that my high flake electron blue is a hard color to get to really pop.  I dont think I will buy the fuzion again for this car as the price vs results wasnt justified to me.  I will give it a shot on a darker car and post the results.  Im not bashing the product, it does give a great gloss and depth to the paint, but it is a bit steep on the price side and the longevity of the product is questionable (but shouldnt be a worry for a garage queen, but I do like waxes I can use on multiple cars).  I plan on maintaining the fuzion with the sprtiz sealant and rewaxing every 6 weeks or so.  Anyways, thanks for reading and onto the pictures!

Prior to videoing the windshield

I've not cleaned the windshield since the last time I made a video(2'ish months). As far as ease of cleaning

Both products are acting as they did a week after applying. The Opti-Glass PRO beads and the Flyby30 sheets. Both work well at repelling water

One area I have seen a difference, let me make it clear that I've not been using my wipers much at all. Since applying the coatings those wipers have probably swiped all of 20 times. I am trying to get a feel for how the products perform while clean and while dirty. Wipers provide that relatively dirt-free surface. No the glass has not been formally cleaned, but the wipers allow both products to act like new after the wipers stroke a few times. That is what I am speaking about while in context of dirty/clean performance in this paragraph.

I've been happy with both. Again

Feel free to leave your own feedback on either product.

There's a local detailer who will do coatings

My questions - 

Did I make the Opticoat/CQuartz redundant by getting pp?

Is it more work or harder to apply (i.e. will the guy need to remove the dealership work before he starts)? 

I feel like CQuartz is almost too good for the car - I'm not driving a BMW or Porsche; would it be a waste to have that treatment over the Opticoat?

Am I better off saving my money and just riding it out until the dealership sealant is worn through?

Long story short, compounded, and polished.

To this effect

A door doesn't match. The rear bumper cover is MUCH darker than the rest of the car. The quarter panels, and deck lid have HORRIBLE fisheyes and ripples/orangepeel in the clear. Basecoat was probably shot okay, but WAY TOO MUCH CLEAR ALL OVER.

Obligatory clearcoat overspray all over the car.

1360883118.0,18jo27,Cleaning filthy vinyl the safe way,muswaj,8,2,3,"For anyone who is familiar with this product

I wanted to share the method I find gives me great results and some pictures.

I use 1z Plastic Deep Cleaner.

I use a horse hair brush like this one: http://www.autogeek.net/natural-horse-hair-interior-upholstery-brush.html

The process itself is pretty straight forward. Remove any surface dust with a mf that has had cockpit premium misted on(just enough to generate some grab in the fibers). Use a long bristle brush to clean out any dust cracks or crevices. If you don't remove the surface dust, you may clean a lot of surface, or make 1 ""pass"" before needing to wash the brush out. Wipe up any residue after a ""pass"" with a mf towel. Use a compressor blow tip in conjunction with a mf towel to remove any build up in the cracks and crevices(which will be necessary if you're generating a foam). Be mindful not to just blast air in without the mf towel in the best spot. Otherwise you will have a mess.

Sometimes

When I say pass

Between the soft bristles of the horse hair brush and the 1z PDC, you should really work in small areas though. I find you get consistant results working smaller areas.

I like to top the cleaning up with a solid wipe down of 1z Cockpit Premium

This is not the absolute fastest way to get ""good enough"" results that some people are looking for. In other words, I believe this is one of the best methods to get really really good results. It is time consuming but oh so worth it.

There are three common ways you can approach this:


* Touch-less Car Washes
* Manual Car Wash
* Home Washing


Which ever way you choose

My biggest tip and main reason for posting is: PLEASE make sure you dry your door hinges and the interior of the door frame -- use canned air and anything you can to ensure they are free of water. Do yourself a favor and go back 2 hours and then 4-5 hours (if you can) and just open your door and close it a few times.

* Should I clay bar and/or wax windows? If not

* Should I clay bar and/or wax headlights? I'm pretty sure I've read that this is a *yes*
* How do I know when a clay bar needs replacing? I'm pretty sure the one I used is about done for since I picked up *a lot* of junk

It looks like this: http://images.gtcarlot.com/pictures/27178371.jpg

The problem is, most of the ""repairs"" stick up above the surrounding paint.  They put the paint on too thick.

So

I figure I have 2 options:

1. Sand down the repairs (maybe wet sand) until everything is smooth and put down the right color (using a spray can of factory color paint) along with some clear coat on top.
2. Try and use some sort of cutting compound or scratch remover on the repairs.  This should take them down to even with the rest of the paint without doing as much damage to the surrounding area.  Then fill with paint and clear.  

Which option would be best or is there another option I haven't thought of?  I can't afford a re-spray and doing this myself should only be about $100.

Secondly I would like to have someone confirm my product selection and process.

I've had this car just over a year now.  Shortly after purchase

Unfortunately, it can be cringe worthy.  I'm mostly curious as to the cause and if anyone has any thoughts to mitigate.  I've been hand waxing the whole car and tried some light polishing on one of the affected panels and didn't nice a difference.

To me, but from the factory wrap I can say that the defect I see lines up almost perfectly. I've been back and forth with the dealer on this, but they claim the car has decals on it previously.  I have since been able to contact the original owner whom says that he did no such thing.  Dunno, just want to get it fixed.

Not opposed to taking it somewhere to have it professionally worked on

I drive a black 2008 BMW 328i. Paint is in great condition albeit a few hard water spots from apartment complex sprinklers on windy days. 

Thanks guys!

Oh

UPDATE: Since I'm sure you've spent the rest of your day thinking how my detail turned out...

So, but they are at least smooth. I started on my trunk with the 105 Ultra Cut Compound as my test area. I was pretty freaked out because it didn't go on very smoothly. My experience with waxes and polishes is that they are nice and liquidy, ya know? So, when it didn't have a good flow to it I decided just to do the trunk and that's it. It didn't damage my paint at all, but due to uncertainty and time constraints I decided to jump to the 205 and a softer polishing pad.

I then did my roof after switching product and pad. Went on much smoother. Took it off right after it went on. The hard water spots were still visible (but we know it's only us that can see them. the rest of the world doesn't have a clue that they're there

1375470685.0,1jkyib,"Expanding Kit: Questions for a Beginner (Clay, Sealant, Wax, Leather)",bmcclure937,2, I am not quite ready to get a DA yet. I recently [bought my first wash kit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1ihlg1/my_first_kit_part_1_car_wash_supplies/) and am looking to expand slowly. I still need a number of items (foam gun, etc).

---

Couple quick questions. Hopefully these same questions may help some other beginners.

1. **Clay Bar** - I am ready to get a [clay bar kit](http://www.amazon.com/Griots-Garage-11153-Paint-Cleaning/dp/B003POLA84/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I3V70VR6NKMG88) (planning to use [Optimum No Rinse](http://www.amazon.com/32oz-Optimum-Rinse-Wash-Shine/dp/B000E9TS6O/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1G3MIT4I820YI) cut down into detail spray/clay lube). If I clay my vehicle will it remove current wax/sealant? Does that Griot's Garage clay look like a nice kit? I know there is a patent in the US so all of the clay is the same stuff

1. **Sealant** - I am looking at [Chemical Guys Black Light](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-GAP_619_16-Hybrid-Radiant/dp/B004L5WLZ2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=IOOTFB3QZMUAD) and [Collinite 845](http://www.amazon.com/Collinite-Liquid-Insulator-Wax-Combo/dp/B005ZUMLV6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=IO8Y6UEU5ILN1) as a sealant. Is it possible to apply a sealant by hand (using [MF applicator pads](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-EvenCoat-Applicator-Pack-2/dp/B0009IQZQG/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I2QZMON5WIOEFC) and [CG ultra plush](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-MIC_1024_3-Ultra-Plush-Microfiber/dp/B00A8MZ910/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1ETOJCGQ4TUGV))? Would it be a bad idea to use sealant if I have not polished the vehicle

1. **Wax** - what wax should I use after the sealants mentioned above? I was considering a Black Light / Collinite 845 combo. I have heard that the #845 is a sealant/wax mix. Would I be able to get away with simply using the Collinite?

1. **Leather Care** - [Lexol](http://www.amazon.com/Lexol-Leather-Cleaner-Conditioner-Vinylex/dp/B002ZBPXGS/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1BZNH2TVQ83NO) or [Griot's Garage](http://www.amazon.com/Griots-Garage-11142-Leather-Care/dp/B002LNGKU8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I2WRP1GYZOHQ74) or Other??

Sorry for the questions. I have been overwhelmed with info and am still mastering my wash technique. Once I expand to include clay, [trim dressing](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-TVD_109_16-Weather-Tek-Protectant/dp/B001TI1F5Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1Y87Y47GFLWR8), [wheel well spray](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-TVD_104_16-UnderCarriage-Detailer/dp/B001TJWO4Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I3VI69517GV0ZK), etc.

I've been keeping it clean with washing and vacuuming as often as I can but recently I've been thinking of adding some more steps to really keep the paint looking shiny and new. I've done some research and read The Bare Minimum Supplies List but with all the different products out there
From what I've gathered I need to stop using dishwashing liquid, and finish with a wax, right? While I'm willing to put more work into my car, I don't know that I have the time for a show car detailing process so I appreciate using only the most necessary products to get that gorgeous paint shine. Obviously I need advice haha

* My car is about 16 months old.
* The paint is flat chili red.
* I have very fine swirl marks (probably from the dishwash liquid and using towels to dry my car... I know
* I have white decals all over the sides of my car. They're birds of varying shapes and sizes so its a bit difficult to use products that can't be put on the decals.

It just rained here the other day and having my first NICE vehicle I wanted to wash it right. I didn't know there was this subreddit, and wipes (interior) and a Simonz microfiber towel. I was relatively happy with the leather cleaner and soap but the interior wipes didn't seem as good as they should have been (streaking). I know these may be dumb questions but as I know nothing about interior/exterior PROPER care for a vehicle I want to ask the following questions. 

TL;DR Start HERE:

What are the best interior wipes? Or should I have gotten the spray to prevent streaking?

Is Meguires a reputable brand? (I only bought it because the bottles looked professional and it was slightly more expensive

How do I stop the water spots? Even hitting it with the towel after isn't getting all of them.

The truck does have some small

Should I wax it? I haven't ever waxed anything before

Should I clay it? If so how?

I know this is a lot guys. If you don't feel like answering all these possibly dumb questions could you link a reputable site or article. In the three days I have owned (my first) black vehicle I have realized it is a definite responsibility. 

And finally is this even possible for me to pick up or should i just take it to a professional? Note a lot of people with show/very nice daily driver refuse to take their cars to any of the detailers in my town for reason I do not know. All I know is that all of them do not have a good rep regarding doing a good/professional job.

1372888232.0,1hlfdr,How to water/dirt/sand-proof trunk?,RibsNGibs,5,1,4,"Hi

I have a brand new car with a pristine trunk lined with... felt cloth or something like it. The back seats fold down 60/40 for extra space if I need it. I need to put a lot of wet, unlike my last car, which ended up completely disgusting, wet, and filled with sand, I want to take better care of this one. So I'm trying to figure out how to water/sand proof it, up the sides of the trunk as well (so the all-weather rubber mat trunk liners you can get won't fully cut it), elegant mod?

At first I just threw two giant [sterilite boxes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MPQ91C) back there, and also sand don't care about no boxes - it goes everywhere.

Now I have a trunk-sized piece of painter's plastic sheet that I've laid back there, except that it looks super ghetto, the tape keeps falling off the felt (or whatever the trunk and back-of-seats is lined with), and it RUSTLE RUSTLE RUSTLES. I was thinking of getting a big sheet of rubber (not sure you can get sheets of rubber wide enough), but then still not sure how to attach it to the car (I would want this solution to be removable so I can clean it, or just take it out in case I don't need it). I was thinking velcro would work (and the hook side of velcro does in fact stick to the felt), but I'm worried about the felt getting completely torn up and ruined after multiple attach/detachings. Maybe I could sew snap buttons on the felt and on a big rubber sheet and then I can just snap the rubber sheet on.

Anybody have a better solution? Anybody know where I can get big thin sheets of rubber? To go up the sides of the trunk and up the backs of the back seats

I'm done using Rain X as it just doesn't last long enough and I'm sick of the white silicone gunk. I've spent quite awhile looking up different brands of rain repellents and this is what I've found. If you've used it


--Invisible Glass w/ Rain Repellent (I think they're discontinuing this).

--Trico View (formerly Aquapel)

--Green Earth Technologies Hydrophobic Rain Repellent 

--National Cycle RainZip (made for plastic

--Pinnacle GlassCoat w/ Rain Repellent


There are more but these are the ones that had somewhat decent reviews. Trico View and Green Earth Technologies are the only ones that seems to actually bond to the glass. Everything else says it's just a coating so I don't see them lasting long. Pinnacle even says you have to regularly apply it especially if you use your wipers. I think Trico View is the best bet but it's expensive so I was just wondering if there was anything that lasted just as long but was cheaper.",self,t5_2sjf8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1ekyuz/rain_repellents/

I never took ""after"" pictures


After washing it it came out clean but it is extremely faded and I've been trying to decide what order and products I should go about using. You can see the hood and all but one fender are pink instead of the red like the rest of the car. My objective is to wash
(or whatever it takes) to get this paint in better condition. The whole car should look like the one good fender

Also for giggles don't link me to the person who restored the paint on the prelude a couple weeks ago from pink to red as well as the other person who had a faded chalkboard red hood on his ford I think it was.

1365794105.0,1c83ds,Cleaned up a trashed 2006 Honda Accord.,spellrm,6,0,8,"[Album](http://imgur.com/a/ece4E)

I spent about two days on this car. The first day I tackled the interior

Since this car is white, light polish. Here's the process:

1. [Wheels](http://imgur.com/a/ece4E#8woTClJ). Clean the wheels with Meg's Wheel Brightener and a Daytona Speed Master Jr brush. Wheel Brightener is harsh

2.  Car was foamed and left to dwell for 2-3 minutes. Then pressure washed off.

3. Car was washed with Meg's Gold class wash and the two-bucket method

4. Taped off a [test spot](http://i.imgur.com/Ae4WTvC.jpg) on the hood to dial in my quick polish process. I didn't want to spend a lot of time polishing this even though it needed a heavy compound. You can see that my test spot is rather large because I was planning on moving the polisher faster and covering larger areas at one time.

5. I opted for [M205](http://i.imgur.com/fWXf7V2.jpg) on a [Lake Country white pad](http://i.imgur.com/sFCI0yM.jpg). I only did 1 section pass with an arm speed of about 1.5x. This was enough to remove the [embedded dirt and grime and restore some ""whiteness""](http://i.imgur.com/Z5CKWwr.jpg) to the paint

6. After polishing

7. Next came the 50/50 IPA wipedown to get rid of any polishing residue left on the paint from the M205.

8. Finally, the sun had set on me.
