I wish to remain anonymous as posting this will undoubtedly have some negative consequences to me, Boston.com and other posts. 

Circles has a large call center in Chelmsford on Apollo Drive that services a major credit card 24/7. On 4/15 several employee with relatives in the marathon asked to be excused to check on family health, today the same has occurred, those employee's in the lock-down area or who cannot access transit were told to take an occurrence, carpool, or find some way in. 

Circles has decided that corporate profits and credit card client demands seem to have a greater directive then safety of their employee

I am one of those who cannot commute in today but being salaried I'm in no jeopardy of termination

I'm in a real shit position with my personal karma right now.

First, but there are just so many that I will try to limit it to the most glaring ones. 

1. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gc3sr The guy originally writes ""Please sensor the names, and it is highly doubtful that a poor English speaker would be able to recognize the spelling error. A non-native speaker is also NOT confident enough to assume that a native speaker made a mistake and carry on with confidence.

2. There are numerous times where she writes extremely American and almost slang-type of phrases. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gcxs9 This shows her saying ""wiring money"" and ""financial assistance."" There are just much

3. There are many English mistakes that are inconsistent and downright silly. Plural and singular nouns are one of the easiest things you can learn in English

4. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gden7?context=3 She writes a near-perfect sentence, saying ""prepare me well for English exam back in Seoul."" Then a comment about how she wants to get a 100, to play up the Korean stereotype. 

5. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gbjae ""Front Page is big honor""? Why not just say ""Front Page bring great honor to my family!"" I immigrated from Korea. No one actually talks about ""honor."" This is just an Asian stereotype that OP knows that non-Koreans will eat up. I'm genuinely surprised she didn't make a Starcraft reference. 

6. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9g57xb Someone types in all Korean, and that her friend is OK as well. The screencap merely said that he is glad she found a good host, and told her to ask Reddit for financial help if she needed it. She answers in a vague, off-topic way, and it is clear she does not know Korean.

There are many more, and most importantly, the general feel. Both the boston and bestof thread are full of people whose intuition just tells them it's fake, and I agree. I have left out many things for the sake of (relative) brevity, so feel free to ask about things you are still not sure of. ",,False,t5_2qh3r,True

Today he shows up with a new humidifier and tells me to get some sleep and that he was worried about my health. Thank you for the humidifier Mr. Regular. He has made my year and restored some of my faith in humanity.

If this were Chicago, then Cambridge and Somerville and Brookline and Watertown and a few others would all be under the same city government.

Until very recently, go there"" to people in Somerville, Cambridge, and other nearby towns.  IMO, shoving relevant content (or people) away from /r/boston would make this place less useful and less fun.

Having separate reddits for some of these cities - and even for neighborhoods within Boston proper - is not necessarily a bad thing, where we can see what's happening all around the city, is a good thing.  Pushing that content out of the main reddit means pushing it away from people who'd be interested, but don't know to look at each one of the smaller reddits.  It would fragment the community when there doesn't seem to be an overriding reason to do so.

Since some of these comments are coming from moderators, without the users asking for such a change.  Can we please expand the moderation team to include advocates of a greater /r/boston, that includes the whole city?

----------

EDIT: Clarification of what I propose ...

Never use either of these:

* The fact that a particular location is inside or outside the municipal boundary of Boston proper

* Whether or not there exists another subreddit for that place

... as a reason to or justification for:

* Whether something is relevant to /r/boston

* Whether something belongs in this subreddit

* Any decision about how this subreddit is managed or moderated

In other words

Of course nobody can force anyone to act that way.  It's just my proposal.  But if the moderators follow that proposal,,False,self,t5_2qh3r,1369266977.0,,True

1374687350.0,1iyvmd,My friend and I have finished the Boston events calendar - an idea that initiated here about four months ago. I present to you: TheBostonCalendar.com. Details inside!,yiseowl,370,43,78,"[TheBostonCalendar.com](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/)

---
Hey everyone, under-publicized, mostly-free events happening around the city and surrounding areas (e.g. Cambridge, Somerville, Brookline).

The brief background of the site is four months ago I read [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/19bz00/would_it_be_possible_to_make_a_boston_google/?sort=top) where a user ([xerxesxerxes](http://www.reddit.com/user/xerxesxerxes)) inquired about putting together a list of events happening around the city. I thought that made sense

A lot of the events currently on the site are ones that I added myself -- mostly things I think redditors might be interested in (e.g beer tastings, free yoga sessions, board game meet-ups). I'm also planning to keep up with any and all events that get featured in the Boston event subreddit ([r/BostonSocialClub](http://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub)). For example, try clicking '[Next three months' and filtering by 'r/BostonSocialClub](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?day=24&amp;year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;three_months=1&amp;tags[]=r%2FBostonSocialClub)'. By doing that you'll probably find the [r/Boston: Beach Day \(Revere Beach\)](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/r-boston-beach-day-revere-beach) event (something I'm looking forward to going to myself).

So, here are a few of my personal picks currently on the site:

* [Drawing in the Galleries at the MFA](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/drawing-in-the-galleries-at-the-mfa--2) (draw in an MFA gallery - for free - supplies included!)

* [Beer tasting at The Old State House](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/beer-tasting-at-the-old-state-house) (10 bucks. Learn what kind of drinking games Sam Adams used to play - in the Old State House!)

* [Stair Workout at Harvard Stadium](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/stair-workout-at-harvard-stadium-the-november-project--2) (The November Project) (""grassroots workout tribe."" $0 forever!)

* [Open Mic Night \(for comics\)](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/open-mic-night-for-comics--3) (Union Sq

* [Public Open Night @ the BU Astronomical Observatory](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/public-open-night-the-bu-astronomical-observatory--3) (free star gazing -- multi-million dollar telescopes)

* [Office Hours with George Mabry](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/office-hours-with-george-mabry) (talk with a Venture Capitalist on-on one -- for free!)

* [Classical music in Jamaica Plain \(in Victorian home\)](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/summer-song-with-elena-cervone-soprano-seunghee-lee-pianist-in-jp-victorian-home) (listen to classical music and drink wine in a beautiful JP Victorian Home

And if I haven't hit my tl;dr quota yet

Got a date coming up? [Filter events by 'Date Idea' and click 'This month'](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?day=24&amp;year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;this_month=1&amp;tags[]=Date+Idea).

Looking for something fun to do at the beach? Just search ""[beach](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?day=24&amp;year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;this_month=1&amp;tags[]=Date+Idea)"". Interested in pick-up sports or some free yoga? Try searching  ""[yoga](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search=yoga)"" or ""[pickup](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search=pickup)"". 

Looking for something cool (and free) to do this week? Simply click ['This week' and filter by 'FREE'](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?day=24&amp;year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;week=1&amp;tags[]=FREE). 

Interested in playing trivia anytime soon? Search ""[trivia](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search=trivia)"" to find a trivia night happening on your desired day of the week. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this

Yes MA'AM, the car was an unmarked police car!  Oh, I've nearly been hit as a pedestrian multiple times and was very close to getting t-boned by an oil truck that ran a hard red light that everyone runs with no cops in sight to stop them.)

[Sweet Idea](http://www.haveasweetidea.com) is a new cookie delivery business coming to Somerville, really easy to spot and flag down for superfast deliciousness. [The full uniform, in action.](http://imgur.com/PrUJc)

Initially there are only going to be two flavors, even in the snow, rain, rapidly approaching apocolaypse, whatever. If we get a hurricane this year, maybe I can fly around instead. (The cookies are just a little airborne, they're still good

Basically, text Sweet Idea at 424-241-2825. (No time to answer the phone, got cookies to deliver!) You can also order online at [www.haveasweetidea.com/order](http://www.haveasweetidea.com/order).

For those of you who are getting run ragged by strangers wandering through your home

I was hoping to file a restraining order, call the non-emergency line of your PD and make a report. Three of those = restraining order, and the fourth = handcuffs.

If they open the door without prior permission

TL;DR realtors don't actually have the right to show the apartment while you're living in it (it is at your discretion and comfort)

Now

EDIT: wow guys, and only the Landlord has any right to access the premises while you live in it. My lease says otherwise and yours probably does to; that doesn't matter. If your landlord isn't a jerk (mine isn't) then by all means, let them show the apartment, but I'm talking about an agency that was hired to show the place, a ragtag band of thugs who have keys to my living space, threatened me in my own home, and I'm extremely glad that I don't have to let them in.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1ilfq1/all_boston_apartments_harassmentyou_has_the_power/

Here's the news report

He's 23
He's been living in Boston in the Allston neighborhood with one roommate

It's thought that he only has his phone, Drivers Licence, Passport, computer were all left at his apartment.

His phone is off and no activity has been made on his debit card since tuesday afternoon. His car has been accounted for.

He has no Tuesday or Weeknight routine aside from occasional coffee shops on his work breaks
Given the circumstances (no behavioral history, etc) the disappearance is super Mysterious. So far no explanations have been proposed.

There's the likelihood of abduction I suppose

He's got an adventurous spirit

Please share with anyone living in Boston. And any Boston reddditors with any thoughts/advice please share. I'll post updates from his parents as I receive them.

**Update 3**
For those still following the story, pretty thoroughly. The most unsettling part of all of this is the complete lack of information - there are people all over the place, he wasn't out incredibly late, and there are cameras around the area he went missing - but nothing has turned up. We have been speaking to specialists to bring in more help for the search, but we're pretty confident we're not going to find a body anywhere near Chestnut Hill. Will still keep you all posted.  
  
One way or another


**Update 2**  

* Fox25 news just aired a 2 minute spot about him  
* We're having a publicity rally in cleveland circle tomorrow
* Please tweet with #FindFranco
      
Thank you all for your continued support.  
  
**Update:**  
To keep the news going
  
We are working with the Boston College Police department and the Newton Police department currently. We are hoping for the Brighton and Boston police to get more involved (especially since Franco was last seen in Brighton). If anyone has connections to Boston, we could really use them putting attention into this!  
  
**People around Waltham:**  
Franco works at a CVS in Waltham. If anyone has seen him there
  
More information and pictures at [this facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/224465344316495/).
  
**Original post**  
&gt;Please Spread the Message:
At around midnight last Tuesday (2/21) night
  
&gt;If you have seen Franco at any point since Tuesday at midnight
  
&gt;You can contact the Newton Police at:

1366254593.0,1ckz2g,Open Letter to Janet Wu of NBC News Regarding Krystle Campbell - victim of Boston Marathon Bombing,prettyautumnleaves,266,36,81,"Good Evening

It’s nice to (informally) meet you. My name is Autumn. It’s unfortunate we have to meet under these circumstances. I’m hoping this letter will change that.


I’m 24 years old, resilient, and diligent. God, I love that dirty water.


Like most, how important it is to say a simple “I love you,” and how unequivocal it is that your Dunkin order came with two packets of Equal instead of three (give it another 2 blocks or so, you’ll stumble across another drive thru). 


While watching NBC’s 10 o’clock NightTeam News on Channel 7
Janet Wu featured a press release the Campbell family issued earlier that day from virtually the same spot as she stood now (you can view the press release here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KP20kCIC0). 


I watched the remainder of Wu’s news story, but instead Wu simply wrapped up her story before a commercial break.


I couldn’t help but feel enraged. Did Janet Wu – or her camera crew, and enlighten Ms. Wu on just how disrespectful and insensitive this decision might’ve been? The story could’ve easily been given from a cozy newsroom and have still had the same effect on viewers – while giving courtesy to the Campbell family.


Assuming the answer was “no, I had numerous strangers messaging me, explaining that they were also outraged by the news coverage – and it wasn’t long after that Janet Wu – or whomever is in charge of her Facebook page – deleted my comment. Still bothered, I decided to take it a step further and post to  NBC via Facebook. This was my message:

 
&gt; Hi

&gt;I would like to leave a comment regarding your News7 Boston Channel and your anchor Janet Wu. I'm a Massachusetts resident and have been personally touched by the devastating events that occurred at the Marathon. I've rejoiced in the humility and acts of kindness shown by complete strangers to one another. It takes someone completely estranged from sanity to commit such acts of evil. However, she promptly deleted my post and went along with her day. While I'm not one to judge, I am deeply unnerved by her ruthlessness and insensitivity to the matter at hand. I pray that one day she will be able to put dignity ahead of her salary. 

&gt;NBC


Within minutes of posting it
I am entirely outraged. As far as I’m concerned


Please – I urge you to pass my letter along


Thank you for your time. Keep Calm and Boston On.

Our new owner/managers were from India and it was their first month or so in the country. I tried to take it off

I show up at work around 5pm and quickly realize that I'm the only one on the schedule for the entire night. Anyone not familiar with the area should know that this is the closest Subway to the Esplanade

I sold out of bread within the first two hours. I called my bosses asking if I could be let out

They told me to hold on. 

So I closed the door. People banged their fists

An hour later

Two hours later

Thankfully

Drunken idiots came in, but they just laughed. When I told them to get out again, they threw their sandwiches at me. I dodged them, but picked up the sharpest knife I could and screamed at the top of my lungs that the store was closed. It was a fucking mess. 

I didn't clean up

The next Monday

I told them that I quit on Independence Day.

I've never tried to organize something like this before and have very little details right now (I just read the news of this this morning) but would other Redditors in the area be willing to join in and keep these people at bay if they do show (in the same manner the Patriot Guard does)?

FINAL UPDATE:  A huge thank you to all that came to show your support! There were literally hundreds of you and it was awesome to see people make the effort, they were amazingly helpful.  The WBC did not make an appearance, which is the best outcome we could have hoped for.  Finally, thank you to the organizers of The Human Wall, you did a fantastic job!  Please, if you have the means to, I urge you to donate to The 1 Fund to help support the victims and families effected by this tragedy.  Take care!

UPDATE 4:  Thank you everyone

From the Human Wall Facebook Site-

* WE ARE MEETING AT FRANKLIN SQUARE on 4/18

* Please DO NOT GO DIRECTLY TO THE CHURCH: the sidewalks are very narrow

* Please ARRIVE 1 hour early

* Please TAKE THE T: take the Orange Line to Back Bay Station

* Please AVOID BRINGING BAGS OR BACKPACKS. There will be very little room on the street

* Please WEAR BLACK

* Please DO NOT BRING SIGNS or other counter-protest materials. A memorial service is not an appropriate venue to express personal or political views. 

* Please DO NOT INTERACT WITH THE WBC. Do not respond to them

* IF PEOPLE BEGIN TO SING

* Please PRACTICE RADICAL SELF-RELIANCE and bring everything you need: food, contact information, whatever you need so that you can be self-sufficient during this action. Plan ahead.

* Please HELP AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER in maintaining the peace. The WBC can be very antagonistic. Help each other remain calm. 

Remember, rest up, and we'll see you tomorrow.


UPDATE 3:  The biggest Facebook group that's helping to organize this is asking that we meet in the park at Franklin Square (Washington St at E Brookline St

I have also read another group is planning at meeting in Peter's Park (Washington St at E Berkley St


UPDATED 2:  If you plan on joining us, which hopefully means the WBC won't be anywhere close to the memorial either.


UPDATE: The WBC has announce that they will be picketing from 10:15 until 11am on 4/18. We will be there before they arrive and after they leave.  Be sure to arrive a early as it will be busy

The memorial will be at Cathedral of the Holy Cross

Stand in solidarity with the survivors and the families of the victims and show support by creating a human wall to block the view of the WBC. Please consider wearing black to reflect the somber nature of this event.

We strongly oppose any use of violence. Do not intend to make noise or other disruptions at the memorial.  The WBC will be antagonistic and will try to get you to stoop to their level.  DON'T. 

This is not a political demonstration.  Please don't bring signs

1366421367.0,1cpqxg,"MIT police officer, Sean Collier, was truly the best of us. Here's one reason why.",lynnjdsmith,189,7, I admit - despite the fact that she's wicked tough, one female cadet was pulled out because her police chief 'feared for her safety.'

The first week, and she sometimes sounded a little shaken. A month or two in, she was utterly exhausted the few times I got her on the phone. She, along with all the other cadets, was clearly going through a very difficult trial. But, she kept her chin up. She assured me that there were 'some nice guys there...' Here and there, she shared a few anecdotes. She told me a funny story about everyone being forced to do pushups in the ocean surf until someone threw up. She told me of the trip to the Boston morgue, and the ribbing of the unfortunate cadets who threw up (she did not). Overall

But my sis, she looked thin, sick and pale. I made her promise to eat more, and there was nothing more anyone could do. Our whole family was so proud of her the day her class entered Faneuil Hall, gathered upstairs in the historic cradle of liberty, and became police officers.

In the end, I got a small glimpse of what the academy might have been like at times. On top of the difficulty all cadets face, I think the male instructors and cadets had choice - they would be welcome to make it harder for the women and minorities, or not.

Finally, Sean Collier. In the difficult times my sis won't talk about, Sean impressed my sister with his kindness and made a friend. He probably didn't think much of it. But, that's what makes it great. I barely met him. And, I'll remember him for the rest of my life. Thanks, Sean.",,self,,

He was driving a good 65mph on Morrissey Blvd (where the speed limit changes between 35-45mph), I was going a good 40. When I flicked on my turn signal, this man sped up in an attempt to fly by me before I could turn. Whether I'm at fault or not, this man followed me, damaged my car, and threatened my life. Believe it or not, accidents happen. I may not be the most experienced driver, and turned me head to see if anyone was coming. When I did look, it does not justify his actions on Neposet Ave/Victory Rd.**

The gist of it is this:  If communicating with your landlord is not working
 
We did this last year, even the fact that we had no doorbell, though that might have been because he was frustrated when it took us ten minutes to realize he was standing at our door.)  They gave the list to the landlord and told him he was required to fix everything within three weeks.  They also noticed that we needed one more smoke detector and told him he had 48 hours to install one.  I have to say, it was very satisfying to see our apathetic landlord reprimanded by the city.

NOTE: It can sometimes be very difficult to navigate the Board of Health phone system and reach the right person for scheduling this kind of inspection.  Also, and it's an important asset in the fight against sleazy landlords.",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,False,,

One of the runners had to stop running, the marathon staff didn't react. Some runners ran by until finally one stopped to help keep him standing. Then another one stopped to help.

Now, the two runners who had stopped took the hurt guy by his arms and half carried him towards the finish. 

Those runners decided within seconds to abandon their strive for good running times and instead helping a hurt stranger pass the finish line at all. They did this after running 42km and without thinking much. I think that's an outstanding display of kindness and shows how intrinsically good those two people were in their hearts. I stand in awe!

But a lot of my non-New England friends in Boston seem to have no idea what to do about Sandy

1. **Water**: Often during bad storms the main water sources will be compromised and a boil water order issued. But if your tap water is clean there is no reason to go out and buy water to prepare. Instead, which may be important if the weather turns warm. 

2. **Canned Goods**: Make sure you have enough canned goods for about a week without power. Even if your power is out longer than a week, tuna fish, canned chicken, and instant sides like rice or potatoes. If you have a gas stove you will probably still be able to use it if the power goes out (you'll just have to light it yourself), so dry goods will work then too.

3. **Lights**: Obviously without power you'll need another kind of light. Flashlights are great, or oil lamps for just keeping the room lit. For candles, I like to go to the ""Mexican"" aisle in the grocery store and stock up on the basic white candles in glass (they are with the Saints candles - sometimes called 7 day candles). They are usually about $1 each and are meant to last for days. Oil lamps are also super easy to make. You can find a tutorial [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Glass-Bottle-Oil-Lamp/) though to be honest you can just punch that hole in the top of a glass olive oil bottle. 

4. **Bring it Inside**: A rookie mistake is to forget about the things you have outside. If the storm has high winds your grill

5. **Activities**: When the power goes out and you're stuck in your house or apartment for a week it gets really boring. Like really, and stuff like that. Alcohol works too.  

6. **Weather**: Is it going to be cold or hot when the power goes out? How will you deal with that if you don't have power? Most likely for us it will be cold so make sure you have plenty of blankets. I like to keep some hot hands around as well - throw one under your blankets before bed and it will keep you toasty. 

7. **Hurricane Parties**: Hurricane parties are a time honored tradition in Louisiana for a reason. First

* A good spot is a house or apartment second floor or higher (no basements!) with a gas stove

* Coordinate with guests to get food, sleeping bags, and alcohol. You all might be stuck there for days so make sure everyone brings enough for the group. Remember that while beer is great, it kind of sucks when warm. Hard liquor and red wine, on the other hand, are much more drinkable when warm. 

* Have someone bring a grill and charcoal so you can cook outside. Make sure you also have some pans and utensils for cooking canned goods on the grill. Be prepared for neighbors to beg some.

* In Louisiana we love to invite musicians because an acoustic jam session is great entertainment when the power is out. Maybe that's why half of New Orleans can play an instrument. 

* Remember that guests at a Hurricane Party are there for friendship, and safety. But this sense of community is also important for rebuilding and helping one another afterwards. You'll all get to know one another real quick and these things can form life long friendships if you have a good group. Don't invite assholes, really annoying people, and selfish jerks. You're going to be stuck with them for a long time

**Edit: Forgot to add that if you have a car you should try to park it away from trees. Branches and whole trees can fall if the winds get high.** 

**Edit 2: Have some cash on hand in case power is out for a number of days and you need to go restock on supplies. Also fill up your car with gas if you don't live within walking distance to basic necessities. You can fill up your tub with water so you can use it to flush your toilet if needed. Battery powered radios are useful so you can hear if there are any boil water orders or safety concerns. And,False,self,t5_2qh3r,1351471667.0,,flair-GL,t3_127wam

Game Over started as a ""hey wouldn't that be cool if..."" idea and is finally becoming a reality.  We are striving to create a place for gamers and nerd of all interests and sub groups to come together and enjoy their hobbies and passions in one place.  It is for this purpose Game Over was created and hopefully because of this that it will grow and thrive.

We will have everything from board games to card games, and anything else that we can think of or people decide to bring.  We are even working on building an arcade cabinet just for this event and future events.  

Getting into specifics we will be coordinating with the good folks over at /r/bostonboardgames to bring in the cream of the crop of Boston's board game community and hopefully introduce some new people to the awesomeness that is board gaming.

We will be having Magic the Gathering tournaments at the event as well

Table top games will also be an integral part of the night however it is sadly one of the areas in which I am lacking experience or friends who play.  All tabletops are welcomed

We will also have 3 n64s (to start, perfect dark, and anything else people bring.  We will also have one wii (again just to start with, these things are surprisingly expensive) with Super Smash Brothers Melee on it or anything else that is brought to the first event.  We are always accepting feedback in this and any other areas, if you think of something we are missing or should add please let me know!  For our soundtrack I have found a long list of favorite video game theme songs and other related tracks, the list can be previewed [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/SupraDarky#p/c/9B23A78D3D249A74) it has over 1,000 tracks so far and will be on shuffle so it will hopefully provide a sufficient ambiance to the night.

We are always accepting suggestions so if you think we are missing something or should add a new game/system/idea please let me know.  I will also try and answer any questions you may have.
