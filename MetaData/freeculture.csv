## Five steps to DRM activism

1. Go to http://dayagainstdrm.org and pledge to take action.
2. Send the link to all your friends on your social networks.
3. Go to the [LibrePlanet wiki page and list an event you'd like to run](http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2012#Events) (see below for ideas)
4. Email us at the FSF -- campaigns@fsf.org -- an address (in the US and Canada for sure
5. Plan your event on campus or in your local area

## Some ideas for events

* Have a pizza party in your dorm room -- ask people to make their pledge on the http://dayagainstdrm.org website to sign up.

* Throw a frisbee around for an hour. Afterwards

* Ask your school's library to sign a pledge against DRM-ebooks and DRM-textbooks.

* Post copies of [The Right to Read](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html) all over school. 

* Hand out anti-DRM stickers

There's an unfortunate tone here that I've noticed in a lot of free culture references, rather than simply the cultural benefits of freeing one's work, is much less likely to attract people to the philosophy.  I used to provide people with the freedomdefined.org link for exactly this reason, but it seems to be down now (edit:  it's back up).

I assume I'm not alone here in distrusting Google. Google, the whole lot of them. I do have a gmail account, and I use it for a lot of things, including calendar, contacts, and syncing.

So I'd like to throw this out there... What are some good alternatives? If you search for ""gmail alternatives"" most of the alternatives people recommend are just as bad or worse. Trading gmail for hotmail hardly lets you escape the root of the problem, for email. Ideally, email with a web-based calendar, CardDav server, and other niceties that let me run my life.

If you search for paid email hosting

What does r/freeculture recommend? And do you have any good services that also provide CalDav and CardDav services

Some options I'm already aware of:

* Lavabit.com: Seems great. Unfortunately
* PoBox.com: Good, they recently had some high-profile downtime.
* Hushmail: Another fine option

Here's the [back story](http://neuroconscience.com/2013/01/13/researchers-begin-posting-article-pdfs-to-twitter-in-pdftribute-to-aaron-swartz/) about #pdftribute. Basically

The problem with pdftribute.net is that many of the links on the site are not direct links to pdfs but are instead links to other sites that host the pdfs (or links to news articles, and it probably only works on *nix systems, but it does work. Once you have the list of pdf links, you can download all the pdfs using wget or curl.

Maybe someone with a knowledge of torrents and decent bandwidth could download all of these pdfs and create a torrent of them. *That* would be a fitting tribute.

P.S.

I ran the script for 10 or 20 minutes

Are there any other speakers for free software and/or free culture that would make good nominees? Perhaps one of the pirate bay folks would be interesting to hear from

Anyways
[http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker](http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker)

Tell us briefly about the speaker: Occupation? Honors or distinctions? Recent work? Why are you recommending them?

Eben Moglen is a professor of law and legal history at Columbia University, whose client list includes numerous pro bono clients, such as the Free Software Foundation.

I'm recommending him to speak about free software and its increasing importance.

Have you heard this person speak publicly? If so

Yes

If yes

One of the very few people

People's choices in social media platforms do not value ""freedom"" the way our movement tends to think of it. The top priority is in the exchange of information. Information is valuable in its transience

So why do we put so much responsibility on individual users? As a movement, but we must always target those dominating entities. How do we act beyond boycotting proprietary software and cultural works, to strategically topple these media and technology monopolies? 

We can no longer afford to be an isolated, imperialism, prisons, racial/gender/sexual violence, class oppression, etc. How do we broaden our understanding of the relationship between technology and other issues of oppression and modify our messaging around that?

The first dilemma is that Wikimedia Commons will sometimes have content from Flickr that, it's listed as copyrighted. But WC has a bot that verifies that at X date in the past, it was listed under a specific CC license, and many of the Flickr images will have an old comment from the person who put it on WC saying ""thank you for using Creative Commons"" etc. 

So can I use the CC image from Wikimedia Commons, can they stop? I feel okay about using the image from WC, since it was uploaded as CC and is still listed as CC. I just worry that I'd be exposing my organization to some sort of liability.

The second dilemma is that some images on Flickr are listed under a permissive Creative Commons license (like CC BY), maybe then I would license it? Why else would anyone pay for an image that is available for free?

(Don't take this too seriously

There is a debate within the free culture and free software communities (presented within the scope of software

**Permissive vs Copyleft**

Permissive licensing is mostly hands off

Copyleft protects free software by preventing it from being appropriated to restrict users' freedom. One of the greatest opponents to free software is Apple

**Industry forces**

This section isn't very articulate

So long as we live in a capitalist society (disregarding any judgement of it), but is it really the case that a particular business is better off financially by making all the software they produce free? It may be better that the industry/economy/world as whole would be better off, but businesses tend to do what's best for them, and best for them in the short term (hence privatizing everything, stocking up on IP, all sorts of stupid wasted energy that genuinely keeps the particular business in its position but holds everyone back collectively). 

Free software, but if the open source (business friendly, better software, better development, etc) view is wrong, and free software isn't inherently better for business, then copyright is an excellent tool to protect free software (through copyleft licensing). 

**Direct action**

What if we throw this framework out the window? Many grassroots social movements have depended on civil disobedience. Free software has no real form of protest. We, and we can boycott, refuse to use proprietary software (as I think we should), but this is an extremely slow and painful way to get everyone using free software, truly impractical to expect from people. 

We can work within this scope of trying to fix laws and prevent worse laws from being enacted, but that's just enough to keep the dream alive. What can we do that truly disrupts the non-free media industry? 

**Traditional tactics**: 

Just to bang out a few of the worst...

 * Murder (just using Wikipedia's list of tactics): Certainly disruptive. Could yield results. In cases where software freedom is a matter of [life and](http://www.reddit.com/r/freesoftware/comments/jiia4/what_are_the_best_free_software_quotes/) death (life and death is a bizarre construction, this could be an attempt to save more lives than cost. On the other hand, it could just be murder. 
 * Assault: Scare tactic similar to murder. 
 * Property destruction: If so much can be destroyed that it is [no longer profitable](http://redd.it/mijlo) to make non-free works, it would take a shit-ton of destruction and the type of people willing to do that for...software. 
 * Sabotage: Usually requires insiders. Very risky. Similar effect on perceived legitimacy. 

Okay

 * Sit ins, large market forces will dismiss the demand for free code as communist, etc. 
 * Disruptive pranks: Make a mess or padlock gates to keep people from working might have some impact
 * Strikes

These traditional tactics tend to be successful for issues more in the public eye. Are there no tactics that are particularly good at disrupting the business of proprietary software and non-free works? Does it really just boil down to educating users, if we did a better job of educating people on free culture issues)?

**So

Here are some: 

 * Piracy: but it doesn't make proprietary software free. 
 * Unionize: get programmers everywhere to join [IU 560](http://www.iww.org/en/unions/dept500/iu560)
 * Leak source code: Illegal to use
 * Hacktivism: These are cool, how cool would it be to have the Sony website showing some images about DRM and suing hackers?
 * Email bombing: Maybe

Free Software (and Open Source) have been doing well for decades. The greatest threats to either of them are DRM, non-free software bad. Sigh.

Free culture doesn't always come with source code. The sources help

That's not, or remove the fundamental need for freedom. 

RMS and more importantly the FSF (as they're two different things) need to stop spreading FUD that downplays the need for free culture. Being inspired by free software doesn't mean RMS can spend years insisting ""no, it's Not Even Wrong. Please, FSF, make the FSF website OER-compatible.

That's a valid question

My name is Clint Lowrance and I've been writing screenplays all my life, Prime, which I will be re-working as a case study in the book.

Over the next year, being nominated for [Best Screenplay](http://db.tt/5R0RQvu0) in my final year.

In 2010, I am a graduate student in the Media, Journalism, and Film Department at Missouri State, focusing on Screenwriting, under the direction of Ms. [Diana Botsford](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0098595/).

During my time at OTC, although I hope to change this in the near future).

During my final undergraduate semester at MSU

Currently, and directing a small handful of projects, including the webseries t.b.d., the tie-in comic series' *Tales from the Queen City* and *Phenix*, and the tie-in video game *Circle of Heroes*.

At the completion of my [campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/so-you-want-to-be-a-screenwriter-and-underwood/x/362991), part storytelling guide. Upon completion, it will be released for free download under a Creative Commons BY-SA license, as well as for purchase under that same license on Kindle, Nook, and (hopefully) the iBooks and Google Books stores.

At the same time, releasing it under the name Underwood. Additionally, we will attempt to implement several new features, including free cloud saves through Dropbox integration, budgeting, title page customization, and teleplay formatting (adding an “Act” element, etc).

While working on these two projects, Wednesday and work on Underwood Thursday and Friday.

I have broken down my monthly bills (for transparency) below:

Rent = $525

Utilities = $50

Internet/Cable = $50 (I get both so I don't have to sign a contract)

Phone = $75 (I have my phone financed through T-Mobile, I believe)

Gas = $15 (I don't drive much

Food and other expenses = $100

Tuition = $150 (I have to take a summer class online)

Total (x2) = $1

Below are a few samples of my work (some are works in progress
