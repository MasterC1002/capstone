Talent has nothing to do with it. Looks have nothing to do with it. Being local has nothing to do it with it. Being from LA has nothing to do with it. Finally

So here I go

1. Your experience matters more than talent

Let me say that again. Experience matters - more than talent. If I am shooting a feature, I had better be sure as hell that person knows what they are getting into. You won’t sleep well, rather when you can. You’ll miss your kids/ girlfriend / husband / everyone. You’ll be pissed at someone on the set for some dumb reason, mostly because everyone is under stress and gets on everyone’s nerves. And you’ll have to be professional. So unless you have a few roles where you have come close, don’t expect being cast as a lead. Talent is easy to find. Talent that can hack the experience - that’s rare.

Solution - get more on set experience. Do a few small roles

2. You are about the glamour and fame of acting

In short, to be rich and well known. Few really want to be great actors. You want to see yourself on the big screen, but not put in the endless hours to be outstanding as a performer. Great actors are not born, they spend years becoming great. They take classes, work with coaches and constantly improve. They gain new skills as actors of which there are countless. And the dirty secret of Hollywood is that even well know really famous actors have coaches (they can afford them). Actors will spend thousands on headshots to look super hot, but neglect taking a good scene study class. A pretty face tells me nothing about your skill. A good demo reel will give me a more complete picture. Too many actors are motivated by a need to validate their lives with the ego bump that comes with being the center of attention. Too few are motivated by the need to be recognized for their outstanding skill.

Solution - Take a class. Learn new skills. Make it your goal to constantly improve. Try being the best actor you can be, the coolest, the most glamorous.

3. You are virtually invisible online

You may have a Facebook Page, I want to know they are going to be a solid acting asset which means, they will be a constant promotion machine for the movie I put them in. I want to see that they did an interview on the last movie they did. I want to know they talked with even local reporters. I want to see that they engaged blogs, fan sights and reviewers for better or for worse. I want to see an actor who goes to conventions, festivals and other screenings to hype their movies and sell autographed posters and DVDs. I want actors who love and admire their fans as much as they love themselves. In short, if I am going to invest in an actor for a lead, I expect they will invest back in my project in the form of publicity

Solution - Make your voice about the current projects you are on. Make directors want you because you are more of an asset to the movie then just an actor - you are an engaging piece of walking advertisement that draws people in. That’s star power even on a small scale.

4. You lack personal branding

There are plenty of generic actors out there. There are plenty of pretty faces. Being hot, brand yourself as a comedic actor. Are you a hopeless romantic? Try for the romantic roles. And my personal favorite - the horror hipsters who love horror and make it their life’s work. Why is this important? If I am casting a comedy, I want actors who are going to appeal to the comedy going crowd. In a horror movie, there are plenty of overly specialized scream queens and horror monsters who cater to the fans of low budget blood and guts. If you can find what it is that you are perfect for, it is much easier to sell yourself. Don’t worry about being typecast - if you are worried, you are not a true actor. Real actors are happy to be working in any capacity and not tripped up by being labeled.

Solution - Be good at something. Find your type. Sell it. Feel free to challenge it

5. You are self serving and fail to serve the greater community

You talk about yourself constantly. Anytime you talk about anything else, I might think about investing time and money on you. I need team players. I need people who get that the movie isn’t about them even if they are in a lead role. And moreover, I want people that will get that they are in a strongly interrelated movie community that needs promotion from within and from the outside. So if you have no colleagues, friends, no other peoples work you can talk about or get excited about, you lost me. If you love movies, you love more than just your own.

Solution - Talk about, blog about - everyone other than yourself. If you worked with another great person, talk about them. Talk about your fellow actors, directors, crew. Build them up. If a colleagues movies is coming up, hype that too. Attend their movies, take an interest in their projects. Go to industry mixers, it’s about the industry and how we are all doing collectively. If you want to talk about yourself

6. Your audition isn’t the only thing you will be chosen for.

The audition is a like a job interview. You could nail it. It could be the most awesome performance of your life. The decision doesn’t hinge on just that. Directors will look at your resume, they can and will find it. Just like employers do now, they want to know everything about you when they cast you. So if you have some photos on Facebook of you doing stupid things or posts ranting about conspiracy theories, you might not get cast because your public image reflects right back onto the movie you are cast in. The absolute worst thing you can do, it bad mouth other people you worked with. If you did it in the past, chances are you will do it again and that just makes my team seem unprofessional and disorganized. Remember what I said about being a brand? If your brand is a liability, expect to be treated like one.

Solution - Know your privacy settings. Be aware that if it’s online

So please do not blame directors for going out of town to get talent. It’s a business where the competition for roles is high and all of the above give a slight advantage over the next guy

**Few starting words**

So, this post will be updated regularly!*


**But I don't have any talent at all!**


The first thing you must understand is that this won't happen overnight. **Acting is a craft!** What does it mean? It means that acting requires skill. In order to gain skill you must work everyday. There are few actors that were born with the supernatural talent

**I'm too old!**

Are you 18/25/30/35/50 years old? 

*Yes

Once again, so please read. 

There are more examples like Alan Rickman, so please, don't quit.

Well my friend, but go slow. Try to save some money. Your first TO-DO is to find place to stay and a job. Try to get familiar with your new job and new way of life before attending acting classes. Your second option is to work alone at home. I recommend this only while you are working and saving some money to move to a larger city. Read plays, act, record yourself and review it. Make a play, call your family and friends.

**Read a book!**

3. If you are working/going to college, then think about going professional.

4. Want to act in your own house? Choose a monologue and record yourself. After that

5. Are you a shy person? Having big stage fright? Don't worry

6. Don't forget to watch movies

That's all for now. Remember to have fun. If you fail

This is a common question here, and if you have questions beyond what's contained here fire away.  We don't bite.  Also, this will be very US-centric, because I've only acted in the US.

Acting is a thing learned by doing.  It's a craft.  It's improved over time, but at some point you just have to get up and do it.  So...

**1.** Take a class.  Based on everyone who's asked about this so far, they spend time doing this.  You have to log in the hours to get better.

**2.** There are no classes nearby?  Really?  That's a shame.  Check out any sort of community theatre in your area.  Find out how to get involved with them.  Try auditioning, give feedback, work on an acting book together, book-club style.  And eventually if you really want to do this you're going to have to relocate to an area with classes/theatres/film schools/etc.

**3.** This is a marathon, but you'll have to learn how to focus it.  It's a long process of learning about yourself and what works best for you, and exposing yourself to new techniques and new teachers, or rediscovering some old technique that did nothing for you two years ago but suddenly opened up a wellspring of emotion.

Honestly, and you have to have someone watching you do it because you can't watch yourself.  Even on film, you'll need an outside eye to help you out.  But this would be a pretty lame post if I left it here, so let's dive a little deeper.

**Monologues:** you'll need them at first.  Everyone coming here wants them.  There are no shortcuts.  Ideally you want monologues from plays.  Film could work, and you're setting the bar VERY high if you're forcing the auditor to compare you to Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men.  So just do monologues from plays.  You're going to have to read a lot of plays.  The library is your friend.  Thus far I haven't found any incredible online resources for monologues, because a lot of the sites have standalone ""original"" monologues with zero context, and the authors haven't exactly proven themselves.  There are a ton of monologue books.  They're not a bad starting place.  The chances of a monologue being overdone increase dramatically once it's anthologized, but that's not always a dealbreaker.  In the very least it's a good way to introduce yourself to a variety of writers.  Do your absolute very best to read the whole script from which the monologue came.  It'll make your job easier, and you won't look dumb if someone asks you about your character.  Oh, and did I mention we have a few sidebar items to get you started on plays?  And if you start taking classes

**Scenes:** again, film/TV can be a problem if you're really familiar with the original performance.  It'll be hard to do your own thing without imitating, especially if you're starting out.  So, read a lot.  

**Auditions:** Reliable sites include [Actors Access](http://actorsaccess.com), [Backstage](http://backstage.com)(an excellent resource in general), [ActorsPages](http://actorspages.org), [NowCasting](http://nowcasting.com), even Craigslist, though the standard Craigslist warnings apply.  Don't do anything you're uncomfortable with (i.e. nudity, risque situations), so it helps to at least have some training and good headshots before spending the cash on them.  And they aren't scam-free; as iknowyouright wisely said in [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/w4qru/which_of_the_big_actorcasting_databases_are/c5a7qxx)

**Headshots:** something you'll need eventually, not heavy on the makeup/hair styling unless you typically walk around like that).  Focus should be on your face, eyes looking at the camera, something going on behind those eyes.  Background shouldn't be too distracting.  In America headshots are generally color now, though apparently that's not quite as widespread in the UK.

**The Business:** don't worry about it if you're just starting out.  Don't worry about getting an agent, but don't worry about pursuing them just yet.  Just worry about figuring out how to act, and act well.  Work on yourself and learn what works for you.  Don't be dogmatic.  Don't sneer at The Method, and don't say it's the only way to act truthfully.  Don't get too hung up on your type.  It's a good thing to be familiar with, but in many high school and college acting scenes there's a limited talent pool so people play against type all the time out of necessity.  My first onstage role was at age 19 playing someone's aging father, because I had the deepest voice.  Your type becomes important when you're in big ponds competing professionally, because you want to play to your strengths.

**Scams:** don't give people money up front.  Agents make their money after you book auditions that they lined up for you.  They usually only take 10%.  Beware of strangers referring you to headshot photographers; oftentimes they're just getting a kickback from that photographer.  Beware of people in malls telling you they can get you on a Disney show.  Beware of directors who want to cast you but need a little money from you to get the project off the ground.

I had zero experience acting. I always enjoyed plays and the arts in high school and college but I was a jock and always afraid to put myself out there like that. I love movies and think I am somewhat creative and want to be part of a writing team and help develop some products. My major in college was biology and I always thought I was suppose to graduate and take my MCAT then go to med school. But I wasn't passionate about it and decided to do what makes me happy. So because of some connections I have at different colleges, lists of roles you have had and an audition; none of which I had done before. 

So I found r/acting and read how to get started. I decided to do some local theater and auditioned for a play. While the role I got was very small with limited lines, the director was reasonable and let the guy go do theater in NYC for a gig he didn't think he would land. Anyway, he saw me and liked my look and had me in for an audition. Last night he called back and offered me the part of Kenickie in Grease. So now I get to work with other very fine actors, some of whom have been on film and TV. I have head shots later this week! So here's to hoping its one of many parts I land. I still have a long way to go and a ton to learn but stories from this sub gave me the courage I needed to try it.

Knowledge is the enemy of the scam.  Scammers are counting on the fact that you're new and ignorant to how things normally work in the entertainment industry.  So

And casting directors are paid by the production company for which they're doing casting.  Per [u/crogers2009](http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1jfknj/scams_educate_yourself/cbe6qrq), in smaller markets you may see some variation on rates, and they may charge a SMALL fee to keep you listed on their database.  Try to check with your peers there to make sure everything's on the up and up.

**They reached out to you:** in case you haven't noticed, because they're flooded with submissions constantly, and they rely on referrals and good work they've seen to connect them to clients.  I have gotten some traction from cold mailings to agents, but of course I keep track of who I mail to and if they get back to me I know who they are.

**They're making big claims and promises:** if they say they have a ton of success stories, you're not going to audition for the next big young adult franchise.  Unless you're drop-dead gorgeous and your dad's best friend is an agent at William Morris Endeavor.  In which case can I send you my headshot?

**They focus on youth:** Have you ever been to the performing arts section of Yahoo! Answers?  It's flooded with 13-year-old girls trying to get cast in Disney shows.  Scammers know this

**Your gut:** I can't recall a time that someone came here asking if a company was a scam and the answer was no.  If you're asking the question it's because something

**Here's more info that will help you spot scam companies.**

Actor-&gt;Agent-&gt;Casting Director-&gt;Those responsible for making the project (director, etc)

That's the normal chain you have to follow to get cast in a paying, so they bring you in to audition.  They like your audition, so they bring you back (or send your tape) so the director, producers et al. can decide if they want to use you.  Managers can play a role too, early in the chain around the Agent link.  [See below](http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1jfknj/scams_educate_yourself/cbe7o4k) for some discussion on that.

At no point in this process have you spent any money.  Production pays the casting director

So, then you've got a red flag.  

Several of the companies people have asked about here do not fit into that chain.  They outright state on their site that they aren't talent agents or casting directors.  So, they're not doing anything illegal, because they promise nothing.  Sometimes it's a stretch to even call them a scam, though most likely they're well aware of the fact that they're taking the money of actors without any chance of a return on that investment.  They're trying to insert themselves into that chain up there.  As I mentioned, any sort of passive casting database isn't going to get you anywhere due to the glut of actors throwing themselves at the gatekeepers.  For example, I'm registered with One on One in NYC.  It's one of those pay-to-meet places.  They keep a list of all their actors that casting can browse, and I've only ever gotten messages from Columbia students because they seem to have some sort of deal with One on One.  I welcome those messages

At this point you may be saying ""what the heck can I do for myself then, webseries, low-budget features or short films, Off-Off-Broadway, local theatre, black box theatre, etc.  This is how you build a resume, and get the attention of those who can help you go further.  You can find stuff like this on sites we've talked about on the subreddit before, Backstage, find out who does the background casting in your area and then find out how they want to be contacted.  Some of those offices may charge a small

You’re so neat. You’re such a neat guy. I wish I woulda known you when I was little. Not real little. But at the age when you start finding out stuff. When I was cracking rocks apart and looking at their sparkles inside. I bet you would’ve protected me. People were always giving me crap. Ya know what? Once I was in a play. I was real glad I was in a play cause I thought they were just for pretty people and I had my dumb eyepatch and those metal plate shoes to correct my duck foot. It was “The Ugly Duckling” and I really dug that cause of the happy ending. And I got to be the ugly duckling and I had to wear some old tattered black cloth and get crap flung at me but I didn’t mind cause the end I’d be that pretty swan and all. But you know what they did? At the end of the play I had to kneel on the stage and cover my head with a black shawl and this real pretty blonde haired girl dressed in a white ballet dress rose up behind me as the swan. It was really crappy

1373254276.0,1hub6i,To everyone asking for advice on headshots,CavaleKinski,34,3,7,"A lot of the head-shots shown on here haven't been right- some are good

You have to do your research before you go out and pay a photographer hundreds of dollars!

I had the great pleasure of having coffee with Jason Siner of ProAct Marketing in LA when he came to my country and I picked his brain on head-shots. Here is some invaluable advice courtesy of his blog:

Marketing Yourself Like A Pro - The Headshot (part 1)
As an actor, presentation of your physical qualities to whoever is making the casting decisions. Before acting ability or experience, it's simply what you look like that gets you considered long enough for the other factors to come into play. If your photo isn't working for you, it most likely won't matter how good everything else is.

Recently, I'm still amazed when I see actors who make terrible ""creative"" choices like wearing sun glasses or a hat that partially obscures their face. The headshot is about showing what you look like. Save the creative choice for your Facebook profile. You also don't get any extra points for going green by lighting only half your face.

Beyond these easily avoidable mistakes, the neutral shot is the ""half-smile"". Always choose a photo where the smile is at its apex, where your energy is at its fullest. Being sort of enthusiastic or kind of happy about something is not a good sales strategy. This doesn't mean you should have ""jazz hands"" or the ""screaming face"" either. You want to appear charismatically enthusiastic, not characteristically insane.

For the dramatic shot, in person, you are not flat and two-dimensional. In order to create interest in you, you must show that you can be interesting, that you can communicate without words. Good film acting is about conveying your thoughts to the audience, so show that you can do that in even a single frame. Make the person looking at your headshot want to see in person how you'll use your unique qualities to bring a character alive. If you do that, you'll get the audition.



Marketing Yourself Like A Pro - The Headshot (part 2)
In part 1 (which you should read first), but may even give you a leg up on being cast.

Whether you are getting headshots for the first time, you need to first choose the right photographer. I'm always a little hesitant to recommend a particular one, and won't in this article, because one photographer does not work for everyone anyway. However, there are some simple steps to take to give yourself the best chance of finding someone who will take the dynamic shots you're looking for.

First, that it's not just about having an attractive shot of the actor, especially if that person is just naturally photogenic. Make sure that the photographer captured the personality of the person. Look up the photographer's website and look at their other shots. Are they consistently taking headshots that bring out the actors' personalities? Are their photos interesting and properly lit? Are you drawn in to the actor's eyes in the photo?

Talk to the photographer before you decide. Meeting with them in person is even better. Make sure you feel comfortable with them, especially white and black should be avoided and taken as a warning that this photographer isn't going to give you what you need. take your time and make sure you find the right person. It's not about cost (There are some bad expensive photographers out there) but about finding that connection with the photographer that just feels right.

Okay, no costumes of flashy clothing/accessories. Don't wear anything that distracts from you or is too specific. Save the toga for the party. 

Also, just remain active. One of the thoughts I like to use is ""I have a secret that you want to know"". You may find this works or something else will, but actively think it, just as you would mentally stay active for a film shoot if you were listening to another character speaking and the camera is on you. In your headshot session, treat the camera as the other person. Again, don't try to show it on your face. If you think the thought, the camera will catch it. It will be ever so subtle

You can also talk to the photographer. A good photographer (which you've found through your research) will chat with you and put you at ease

Probably the easiest way to stay involved in the theatre world is to read plays. And not just the classics, as they are the foundation upon which theatre is built.

Quite frankly, then I would not see 5 new ""Hey, how's my audition piece? I'm doing..."" or ""ACK I need help, what monologue should I use?"" threads every day.

See, you should NEVER need to ask us, the thespians of /r/acting, what to perform for a monologue, because you will be able to remember and reference the plays that you have read, and where good, usable monologues are. This way, overdone monologues from the same monologue books.

1342534965.0,wpa4m,Would anyone like some myths about method acting dispelled for them?,iknowyouright,40,7,57,"Time and time again I see people mention method acting in a thread, it's not made specifically for film. It's derived primarily from the work of Stanislavski

If you have any questions on what Method is, I've watched all of his recorded lectures (they have a video archive at the institute) and read all his books. I'm not an expert, but I studied with some of the last experts on Method alive. So please, I beg you, ask away.

And on an unrelated note, Adler, and Strasberg focused on different aspects of Stanislavski, but if you actually read Stanislavski, you'll find all three are not only saying the same thing, but compliment each other and can be used in tandem.
EX: Sending rays --&gt; Meisner Repetition. Sense memory/relaxation of the muscles --&gt; Strasberg. Using the imagination to enliven the circumstances ---&gt; Adler (really

**EDIT 1- Imagination**: I think here would be a good place to talk about imagination, let alone be able to use, a literal experience for a scene. It's almost impossible given how extraordinary the average character's life is in a play. What he said was to use an *analogous* situation, something that has the essence of the scene in it, in a way you can understand, but where you have to use your imagination to expand upon. Let's say your scene calls for a reluctant murder. You've obviously never killed anyone, let alone hesitated while doing it. But you *know* what that's like because you've killed insects. You've maybe even killed mice and felt bad about it. Or you just imagined having done it. Or you're just the type of person who respects human life too much. All of these are analogous to the event, and something to work from to understand the scene. **ALL** imagination work is like this, I want them to take it to a biologist and ask them what it looks like. 100% guarantee that they'll find multiple paralels to different animals. You **CAN'T** imagine something you haven't experienced at least 1% of. That's why when you dream, so you're making the circumstance of the character real for **you** so that **you** can believe in them. Same circumstances

**EDIT 2- Addendums to being in the sidebar**: First off, be able to ask more questions. I do have to add a few addendums to this though: 1) **I am not an expert.** I am a very devoted actor who continues to study, but I'm still just an actor trying to figure it all out. **When my understanding changes, this post will change.** I couldn't live with myself if I looked back and realized I was feeding you horse shit, so check back and see if one of your questions has been answered in another way! 2) **I have barely scratched the surface of explaining the Method**, and I doubt I could ever do it without a 500 page book. **These explanations of the exercises are horrendously incomplete.** For example: I did not explain you do relaxation with a chair, and specifically with a chair. There are good reasons for it too! So please, please

**EDIT 3- Action = Behavior**: Looking at this, but they're different. Think of when you normally analyze the script, and you're looking for what you're doing to your partner to get what you want. You call those actions, and they are. However, there's more levels that just that, as you all know, and Strasberg lumped all of those levels and the actions in trying to get your objective as Behavior. Think about when you have an argument in life, or take your side, and you love them a lot. Let's say you're not very confrontational, but this straw broke the camel's back and you're acting wildly unhabitually. Are you moving more just to cope and cover and finally get all that shit out there? Are you picking things up and fucking around with them left and right to avoid punching the other person? These kinds of physical actions are responses to inner needs from your character

**EDIT 4- Instigating Circumstances**: Circumstances and how you deal with them are the basis of acting, if you're in your house, you'll behave differently than if you're doing the exact same thing in your grandmother's house. There's one type of circumstance that is the basis of the scene, and everything in that scene is happening because of it. this circumstance caused the scene to happen, and engenders the event of the scene (the ""what"" of the scene, the basic reality of the scene that is the main conflict).That's called the Instigating Circumstance (or that was what I was taught, at least). Plays have them, beats have them, like the Instigating Circumstance of Hamlet being the death of the king (a possible interpretation, and the main basic human reality/conflict of the scene. Strasberg knew you had to filter that Instigating Circumstance into something that was personally motivating for **you**. You have to rephrase it in some way that it created a visceral reaction in **you**

I don't post here much. Maybe you don't either

Other parts of reddit come here often to get advice on certain things
And IMO

Let's make this FAQ! A lot of the people that come here will click that

We, philosophy, news, encouragement, critique, advice, ratings, plays, problems

Do we even have a must read list? I don't know a damn thing about setting up an FAQ or sideba, for the betterment of us who are actors, spectators, artists, actor-moms/dads, teachers, audience members
Let's get an FAQ made for starters and go from there. It'll be great... I just don't know how to do it... I imagine it's collaborative in some fashion... so, PM me, explain it to me, do we PM a mod or something?


**TL;DR: Party has started**


EDIT: Seems we just make the FAQ ourselves and then submit to mods. 

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (LIST ONLY)** *inspired by [lemonpbj](http://www.reddit.com/user/lemonpbj)*


Submit questions here that you think should be on the FAQ for /r/acting, I have taken the privilege of adding my thoughts about the questions underneath them.

**1. How do I get started acting?** *indirectly submitted by [lemonpbj](http://www.reddit.com/user/lemonpjb)*

**2. What are the best books on acting?** *submitted by [GoldenEye008](http://www.reddit.com/user/goldeneye008)* 

**3. Where is a good place to find monologues?** *submitted by [fictionalsleep](http://www.reddit.com/user/fictionalsleep)* 
Maybe this is one that should stay very general on the sidebar. I am not a fan monologues that aren't from plays or film/tv, deadlines, length etc. etc.

**4. Where can I find auditions?** *submitted by [fictionalsleep](http://www.reddit.com/user/fictionalsleep)*

**5. What is the process of a callback and how should I prepare?** *submitted by [star2fruit](http://www.reddit.com/user/star2fruit)*

**6. How do I get an agent? (including information regarding scams)** *submitted by [SamredditSam](http://www.reddit.com/user/SamredditSam)*

**7. What should my headshot look like? (mentioning how an experienced photographer and not a friend is primary)** *submitted by [SamredditSam](http://www.reddit.com/user/SamredditSam)*

**8. How do I balance work and acting?** *submitted by [Lo_Rez](http://www.reddit.com/user/Lo_Rez)*

Honestly

**9. What's the difference between acting for film/tv vs. acting for theater?** *submitted by [GoldenEye008](http://www.reddit.com/user/goldeneye008)* 

**10. What is this subreddit? (explaining the point of r/acting

We need to probably figure this out. In another thread maybe? Get theoretical? I think it's up to us to define... 

**11. Who are the members of this subreddit? (explaining who is this subreddit for and not for)** *submitted by [appleseiter15](http://www.reddit.com/user/appleseiter15)*

See 10. Also, where upon a community is built. A respect for acting exists here. That's awesome! The artistic craft is our foundation then the community of support, discussion, humor, pics, articles, etc. is built upon that. Thoughts?

But seriously boss username he has right? Straight up... NBABASKETBALL. 
That has nothing to do with acting at all.

Ok

And I was shocked when I picked to play Matt in [Dog Sees God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Sees_God:_Confessions_of_a_Teenage_Blockhead)! The play is sorta like Dazed &amp; Confused but using the Peanuts kids, on the one hand I was ecstatic I even got a part (merely having the guts to audition would've been enough for me), but when I realized who I was playing I had mixed emotions to say the least. At first, I couldn't find any common ground between my character and I. Rehearsals were almost painful: being Matt meant dry humping people, spitting homophobic slurs like it was my job, being a general dick to everyone in the room, physically abusing half the cast and all of my props...saying it was a challenge for me was an understatement. 

But over the last three months I realized something about Matt--I was writing him off, this was my first production as an actor, and me being a pretty self-conscious guy in the first place made it hard to do a job where doing it right meant people hating you. That made me realize he's actually a victim (Pig-Pen was made fun of in the original Peanuts comic strips for being dirty all the time), and suddenly Matt made sense to me: he does what he does out of fear, and panics when the normal-ness of his life is taken apart. In time, rehearsals (though I never felt quite 100% at home in my character) became less of a chore and I actually began looking forward to them. 

Fast-forward to this week: tech-day was hell; dress rehearsals were a little rough but seeing the show with the lights

I'm so excited and nervous, but it's been a blast. I've been both humbled and inspired by the talent and enthusiasm I've been surrounded by doing this show. It's finally hitting me--this is really happening. I'm also pretty behind on school work (I have so much respect for theater people in college...I don't know how y'all stay on top of everything) so I'm honestly looking forward to *not* having 4-5 rehearsals a week.

**Technique:**

Konstantin Stanislavski is the granddaddy of modern Western acting.  Not a bad place to start.

**Female**

 Helena from A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare.

Context: Helena is lovesick. Demetrius was once engaged to Helena but abandoned her after he met her best friend Hermia. Hermia's father has promised her in marriage to Demetrius, and conjures up a plan to change his mind.

How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs
So I
Things base and vile
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
So he dissolved
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks
But herein mean I to enrich my pain
To have his sight thither and back again.

Doug from Gruesome Playground Injuries by Rajiv Joseph.

You know what, I came to your house last year and your dad was there, and I know he hates my guts, he always has, and he's like She is where she is. I don't know where the girl is.
He said he didn't care and didn't care to know. And I was about to just leave
(he turns to the funeral home and shouts at it)
You remember
I said to him
You have a daughter and she is a gift from God. She is the most perfect being to ever walk this earth and you don't even know it. And she loves your because you're her stupid father. But you've never loved her back
So fuck you
(beat) And then I told him I hoped he'd die alone.
Which he did.
So I feel a little guilty about that now.
(beat) I can take care of you

Don't you see, Mark? You're running from what I've searched for all my life! Why, because you're scared? Well, I'm scared too, but you and I - we have something worth fighting for. We could make it work, but I care about you. And I know deep down, don't you get it? It's the human experience. You can pretend all you want
Can you honestly stand there and tell me that I mean nothing to you? That everything that happened that night was a lie? That you feel nothing? I feel sorry for you, and you will realize what you threw away. And you will regret it always.

I will be performing as the Dying Man, she cares for others but feels out of touch with the wider community and is slightly unfulfilled but shares a relationship with the dying man who she sees as someone she needs to save yet she discovers she may be the one who needs saving. It is this character I need to cast.

Why am I turning to Reddit to cast an actress?

Well, it seems to best place to find someone new. This project is purely a passion-project, I must stress this. This film doesn't require an Acting School trained actress or someone who has always wanted to be on the silver screen but someone who is passionate about Progressive Art, someone who wants to test waters and push boundaries and someone who cares strongly about the state of the world and it's relationship to religion. Another important note is that this is purely non-profit and not paid. On completion the film will be released online for free after it has been through relevant film festivals and all physical reproductions will be done on a cost-covering basis. Regardless of all the shows myself and my company have done, it is art before money, and money making seems to get in the way of the artistic side.

Character Profile-
Gender- Female 
Playing Age- 21-28 
Ethnicity- Any 
Height- 5'5”-5'11” 
Build- Any

Requirements- 
Live in the London area and be willing to travel 
An Actress who enjoys working intensely with a focus on methodic acting 
Open-minded
Flexible working hours. The shoot shouldn't take more than a week in total and the rehearsal period will be an intensive working period of a few weeks to a month. 
No professional training needed
Someone who really wants to make this project work

I like to build up a friendship with the actress to effectively build up a convincing onscreen relationship and I need to have an intellectual connection to get the best result for honouring de Sades work. I want this to be a modern day adaption of his work and it will be filmed with a focus on a personal relationship with such a wide view of the world

Are you interested?

If you or anyone you know would be interested in performing in this piece,

SPREAD THE WORD!

I have turned to Reddit because of the amazing ability to reach a lot of people with similar interests and with /r/atheism having over 1

Last night, real thee and thou, y’know? Just completely fake. And then I started rushing through it. I just couldn’t connect. I couldn’t get ahold of it…and while I’m….babbling, I look out and there’s this guy in the 2nd row, a kid, obviously dragged there by his parents. And he’s yawning, and he’s kicking his legs, I’m right there with you! I can’t stand this either!” But I couldn’t do that
And I thought “what have I gotten myself into?” I’m not Hamlet. I’m no actor. What am I even doing here? And then I get to the soliloquy, and I just thought, oh Christ, to heck with it!
“To be or not to be, end them”
And I kept going, and there’s that kid. And he’s listening. The whole audience, complete silence, total focus. And I was hamlet. And it lasted about 10 more seconds, and then everything went back to normal. But for that one little bit, for that 1 speech, I got it. I had it. I was hamlet. And then I realized

I'm (25f) going through a situation right now in one of my classes where these 2 sisters (around early 20s, when I discovered that they hate me. Basically our class is structured with a lot of student feedback, the teacher welcomes everyone's feedback to everything regarding scene performances and questions asked in class. The younger sister asked a question on how to cry, and my contribution was ""therapy"" and I was going to explain exactly what I meant (that acting classes have been like therapy--or what I think is like therapy since I've never been--to me because it has helped me bring down walls and get in touch with my emotions), but she completely freaked out and accused me of saying that *she* needed to get therapy, basically taking it personally. After seeing how she got so offended, I really felt bad and wanted to clear it up with her, and went over to her to apologize and let her know that I didn't mean it that way at all. Unfortunately, wanted to clear the air and mediate. Well they said that since they first met me I had an ""attitude"" and that I was very rude and ""nationalistic"" because I ""pretended to not hear/understand"" when she said her name (they have accents, but that's just how it turned out. She doesn't want to be near me or talk to me or make any eye contact. 

I appreciated the mediation attempt by my teacher, I just want to say that if you have good intentions and other people misinterpret it then that is on them. It's not you at all. And there is nothing you can do. The teachers and others in the class basically sympathize with me and understand now that the sisters are volatile, so they know that I am not malicious at all, and I'm not worried at all. Actually I'm using this experience the best way I can... there are many bumps on the journey of an actor/actress, you will butt heads with others and not everyone will like you.

Alright, he embraces it and pours street (ruin?) wisdom through his inner monologue he keeps having all while wandering around the ruins of a place that used to be a massive city.

The character sounds like a stereotypical redneck to give the impression of a stupid person but compensates for that via his character and drive. He's the kind of a person you would want to hang around with in a world like that

If you're interested
&gt;”What keeps me going is the thought that all this won’t stay like this forever. All the previous extinctions haven’t stopped life from emerging again and again, ended up thinking about itself.""

You're free to change some minor words if you feel it'd be more appropriate for the character. Don't make it too serious, thinking in redneck voice. The character shouldn't feel like he's telling a story of any sort, he's just kind of there as if thinking out loud. Meaning that no specific emphasizing of words you would normally do when trying to say something important because to him its just casual blabbering. Imagine what the guy would sound like when at a ranch talking to another redneck brother ""Look at dem horses running wild."" and that's how it should show in his affect.

The movie has already been shot but I'd like to edit it to match the monologue length. To give you little visual guide

It's going to be a visually driven movie with contradicting atmosphere. Stupid sounding guy giving smart monologue while not taking it all too seriously. A character who has every reason to be pessimistic but is content and keeps on travelling forward

Tell me if you're interested. If you've got a good mic and feel like recording something

I'll probably keep updating this thread with stills or brief vids of the short movie to keep you interested although I'd rather edit it according to the monologue. 

The short movie is something we're making for recreation with no budget but it will end up most likely circulating some festivals and such.

**EDIT:** I've been found it's been hard to communicate what the character is about.

I want to move out of my parents' house soon. I have to spend a lot of time and gas driving between the metro area and the house in the north 'burbs

Here are the options I'm choosing between:

1. Seattle. I actually made a point of telling my friends that I was planning to move there, I'm drawn to having such a large network of theatre folks there that I could immediately tap into. Unfortunately, my housing situation has been tenuous, and that's created some discouragement for me. Seattle can be a very expensive city to live in, and the housing market can be cutthroat; I worry that I will spend a large part of my time just trying to find a place to live and a job before I can dedicate more of my energy to being involved in the theatre community.

2. Minneapolis. This would be the easiest transition to make. The Twin Cities acting community is comparable to--and even a little bigger than--Seattle's. It's a bit more affordable to live here. I have a big interest in improv, it's starting to mature a bit. The problem with this option, as well as Seattle, is that they're not...

3. LA/NY. I have a couple of connections in each of these places, but regardless, it intimidates me.

I know that one day I would like to be a unionized actor. I'm just not sure when and how I'm going to get to that goal. I feel like I'm still quite inexperienced. I just can't decide if I should be accruing experience in a relatively smaller market like Seattle or Minneapolis

The difference between the two Los Angeles Stella Adler schools is an important one, founded two unaffiliated schools: one in New York, and one in Los Angeles (the one I attend, Stella Adler Academy of Acting). After her death, the board of directors in the New York campus wanted to join forces with the Los Angeles campus, and our board of directors in Los Angeles resisted for a number of reasons. The New York campus sought to remove the LA campus' Not For Profit status, which the present board of directors believed would be against Stella's wishes. Secondly, the New York campus erected a new Stella Adler campus in Los Angeles

 I hear from a lot of them that drama school isn't for everyone. 

The general processes of a drama school, almost stripped bare to then be built back up. This works incredibly well for some actors, but others might have (without undermining the fundamental need to work at your craft) been more successful/a 'better' actor had the gone straight into industry and learned from experience be it tv/film work or with a rep/theatre company, such as the RSC (as again I have other friends for which this is also proved fruitful).

But I think I've had a major personal breakthrough in my understanding of developing a character which will help my movement

What's holding me back as an actor is I'm over-complicating and underplaying my characters. I understand objective and tactic easily - they are such familiar concepts to me that I could read this into scripts well before I had begun acting and before I had words for these concepts. So naturally, and I focused on complex facets of my character's life and found hints in the language about what those complexities were and used the delivery of that language to bring that out. I think I'm good at creating a character that has depth, but I struggle with creating an *interesting* character, which I feel is a very different thing.

In my daily life, meaningful language is almost always the vessel of my ""tactic"" - accurate and subtle language is how I get what I want. I rarely exaggerate or overplay my language and actions, preferring a stoic quiet attitude so that the subtle meaning of my words isn't overshadowed. So this is my natural direction when I'm acting - I try not to overplay the words, I try to let them speak for themselves, and I limit my body movements in order to highlight the language. This is why I table-read very fucking well but when I start blocking rehearsals I really struggle.

But on the other hand

My solution, insightful, interesting, unexpected, and real ways.

I might be clear and intentional with my language,"" what are they not saying? Maybe, ""Because I don't expect us to be living together much longer."" In what ways is their language NOT what they mean to say? When language is failing, how do they use their body to communicate meaning? How do they get what they want when the stakes are high? Do they emotionally manipulate? Do they dominate and intimidate? How are they using their own emotion to illicit an interaction from another person? How are they asking too much from their scene partners? How are they betraying them? How are they betraying themselves?

How are they not like me at all.

That being said, hell, why not give acting a shot. However I'm still skeptical. I ""suffer"" from social anxiety. There have been times in the past where I've failed a class completely just because I was too afraid to give an oral presentation in front of my class. I'm not really an awkward person, but I can't stand being in the spotlight and *luckily* for me that's what acting is all about, being put front and center.  



A few questions I have:

1. Do you think it's not even worth giving it a shot taking into consideration my social anxiety? Will it help alleviate my anxiety?

2. I'm a decent/young looking 20 year old that lives about an 1.5hr from LA. Any places you would recommend I check out? (I'm not really swimming in the dough.)

I've been researching all night but so far

Currently, my home is New York City (which I know, it's weird that I went so far away for art haha) so I'm always here when not at school. Traveling home is not a problem for me. However, no one in my family know's anything about acting or the arts. I'm pretty much the only one interested in this sort of lifestyle (as in, the no-guarantee where I'll end up next sort of thing).

I guess, headshots, demo reel, things of that sort. Because my school is very into film production and us art majors like to help each other out, this isn't a problem for me. But the agent thing - that's a whole new world for me and something I don't quite understand.

I tried looking up agent directories/reviews/etc. but sometimes, for me, that's not ideal because of my look: 20 yr old, caucasion/middle eastern female that's too short to model, too tall to be of notice/completely average in particular and doesn't stand out in a crowd in NYC. So how do I go about getting an agent? Where do I go first for this thing? And as a starving artist, is there anywhere I can look that will help me out with this for very little money?

I know I'm probably getting way ahead of myself



Also... one of my very best friend's father (he lives out in California) was a supporting lead in a very popular 80's movie and had many 90's hit classics. Currently, it's always to spend time with his son. I don't want to feel like I'm intruding on his life so I wanted to know if it would be rude if I asked him a little about how he got started and where he suggested I go first? Should I email him about this? (I'm friends with him on facebook lol) or ask his son for me or... something of that sort? I know people always say connections in this industry are good to have but I don't want him to think I'm taking advantage of him.

Recently, getting EMC status, and credits at two of the top tier theaters in my regional market. 

However, and yet I haven't booked anything in nearly 2 months. I find myself frustrated with the infrequency of auditions and the seemingly highly politicized casting process (Casting 27-32 year olds in Spring Awakening because they have decent resumes, but couldn't pass for high schoolers if their life depended on it) here. 

So I have been thinking more and more about NYC, and it seems that many of them are formalities at this point, as the regular cast is almost always under contract before they even take place. Obviously, representation is the way to break the cycle, but do I have a realistic shot at someone taking an interest without investing 5+ years in the regional markets before that happens? Is it possible to build a credible resume in NYC without full union status or an agent? How does one continue to climb the ladder when work is scarce?

BIGGER DISCLAIMER: I'm not bragging in any way shape or form. I'm simply putting all I have on the table. Please forgive anything that sounds snobby. 

Experience: I've done 4 high school musicals, but to really stress my vocal skill, which is my focal point. I've taken lessons for 4 years now, have an award for being a male vocalist in Kiss Me Kate, and I've been told by judges, professional singers, and even a current broadway performer that I have an outstanding voice ) I have absolutely no  dance experience, so as of tomorrow

Special skills: I have 3 years of piano lessons behind me, I can volley 3 balls about 20 times. I also have 3 years of tri-athlete training, so I'm in good shape, and have decent endurance. 

Academics: I believe for Carnegie Mellon theatre department, I am 9th in my class of 3-4 hundred. I have taken 4 AP courses, taking 2 more, and run a 1900 SAT score, which hopefully will be brought up to a 2150 by october. I am eligible for an national AP award, and am a member of National honor society, and french honor society. I hold 3 varsity pins for swimming. Besides drama I am a member of ecology club and an exchange student acclimation program. Community service is bolstered with free concerts I provide for retirement homes

Preparataion for the audition: 

I've been doing alot of thinking as to what I can do for my audition...it requires 2 songs, monologues, and do a pick up dance routine. 

The song's I've been thinking of are 

Hello Little Girl ( from into the Woods ) and either If I Can't Love Her (Beauty and the Beast) or Santa Fe (Newsies). I've been practicing the former 2 for a while prior to my writing

As for the monologues, as well as a Sam Shepard monologue I've been learning, but I feel I need something more, upbeat. I'm not really sure. 

So again, or any additional advice. Thank you in advance, reddit :)

1346665292.0,z9vii,at a crossroads:,capt_clark,7,1,14,"this could get a bit lengthy:  

i am in my late twenties, but command a great deal of my time - essentially 9 to 5, five days a week.  

i'm trying to decide if i should bail on theater, night audit shift, and keep plugging away.  

to be fair, and i've wasted many a day hanging around to only not be seen after 6 or so hours.  i do have emc status, but as you likely well know, this only ensures me a spot in front of the non-union types.

i have been working for the past year or so with an off off bway company

so far, and in fact if a bigger show, or production came along through this company, we'd be working around whatever my work schedule would be.  so there's that.  

however

due to financial needs

i have, post honeymoon, and a few other upcoming conflicts, to try and get in front of a camera.  i worked on a film a year ago that ought to be close to finished, but i have no current reel, and that's my next objective.  i don't sing or dance, so musicals aren't really my bag - kudos to you if you've the knack/discipline, and so i don't pursue it.  

bear in mind: i'm not an idiot, is self sufficient, doesn't need to work a money job and might make 50k in a good year.  however, as i'm not generating any income currently, maybe i could use four or more years in an office to build up a savings, pay off my debts, and then give things another go while working with smaller companies on the side.  while i'm not sure that i'd be completely comfortable with the idea of bailing on a company that took a risk on a dude with a bfa in acting, but it's an option - when am i really going to have an opportunity to move up again? 

essentially i'm trying to give all of you an idea of my experiences, and virtually non-existent on film - but we're working to recitify that - and give you the opportunity to weigh the decision against the comforts attached to a larger paycheck, better job title, and executive experience in a successful nyc hotel.  

tl;dr 
do i stop pursuing theater full time to devote myself to taking a stable position with good pay

This, so I might need to get some fresh material for the next go around at that company, even if this monologue would serve well for whatever play may loom in the future.  I then figured that I could probably pull one from the show I'm auditioning for, especially if I get cast, which led to more questions.  So here we go, a few questions to discuss:

1. When is it time to retire a monologue?  In undergrad

2. How forbidden is it to audition at the same company for multiple shows with the same monologue?  Does this show laziness or lower your perceived versatility?

3. How does it look when you're performing a monologue from a show listed on your resume versus one which is presumably of your own making?  I got the impression during undergrad that pulling a monologue from a show you've done is advised against

I'm very intrigued to hear your opinions on these varying degrees of the same question.  As a young actor looking for new monologues to add to my repertoire and trying to break into the non-educational theatre scene for the first time (finally in a big city!)

First of all, there is a somewhat large gap between the world of theatre and film, and I am uncertain whether i should stick to theatre (as it is my background), jump over to film, or have a certain balance between the two.  

It's hard to decide, but it's difficult to pinpoint if I want to diverge with performance in theatre or film in the future.  

Even though I don't have as much experience as others, the same age as me (20) go straight to agencies that will cast them in film or television.  Sure they may get a few jobs at first, but soon fizzle out into nothingness.  **(Warning; Dramaturgy Imminent!)** Understanding the *theory* behind acting, exploring character, and using shifts of actions to create a scene is far more important, especially to young people.  With theatre, you have more time to do these things; play around with scenes a lot more

Having said that, research important people, plays, and patience. There are plenty of opportunities for everyone.  That is what's so cool about it! 

I want to know your opinion! 

**TL;DR** Do you reckon it's better to start out in theatre or film?
