Items needed: 1 Package of Ramen Noodles

1 egg

2 strips of bacon

Hot Chili Sauce (Siracha works awesome)

Sesame Seed oil

Garlic Powder

Onion Powder

Pepper

Soy Sauce (save those Chinese take out packets!)

Cook your ramen (microwave or stove top) to your liking and drain. While ramen is cooking, chili sauce, oil, seasonings, 1/2 ramen seasoning packet, and your soy sauce completely into your noodles. I don't give amounts because you should just do it to taste so if you like it spicy add more chili sauce - and be careful on your oils and soy sauce, as a little goes a long way. Dump the noodles into the pan (over medium heat) with the bacon fat. Move them around so as much touches the pan as possible. Allow to crisp up (check a corner every few moments to see if it is browning) and then flip over - either like a pancake or in chunks with tongs/spatula. Let the other side get crispy. Then, fry an egg in your pan but let the yolk remain runny. Put the egg over the noodles and eat the fuck out of it. Break that yolk and let it become the delicious happy sauce of joy.

Variations: Try beating your egg and dumping it into your noodles while cooking in the pan for a scrambled egg (similar to fried rice) version. Add other seasonings! Try it with veggies or meat leftovers or kimchi. Yum.",self,t5_2rcw0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/rzihp/breakfast_ramen/

_________________

You'll need to make sure you've got the following:

    2 tablespoons favorite oil
    20oz ground turkey
    Half a head of garlic
    1 white onion
    1 red onion
    1 green pepper
    3 tablespoons chili powder
    2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
    2 tablespoons smoked paprika
    2 tablespoons cumin
    1 28oz can of diced tomatoes (not sauce
    16oz can tomato paste
    Half a can of cheap beer      
    1 jalapeno

You should have much of it on hand. If not, but chorizo will fuck it up.

_________________

**1)** Pour the can of tomatoes into the crock pot

**2)** Put half the oil into a large skillet and heat it up on medium. When it's hot

When it's getting a nice beige color

**3)** Put the rest of the oil into the skillet and make it hot on a medium high heat. Keep it moving with what's left in there. When it's hot enough

Empty it all into the crock pot. Drop the jalapeño, too.

**4)** Back in the skillet, and pepper flakes. Let it simmer for a half hour while the stuff in the crock pot stews.

**5)** Combine it all together into the crock pot. Stir it really well for about a minute. Cook it on high for four hours.

**6)** After that

Just did this for V-day

A heating element that can be plugged in at the table is the best

It's as simple as raw meat, but that's me.  Put them in the pot and set it to low boil.

Side course was just Sharp Velveeta and sour cream for a cheese sauce.  Just don't use a gooey/rubbery cheese and it should be fine.  I tried Fontina and it turned into a brown tire at the bottom of the bowl.  Same thing though

I have an actual fondue pot, where I can have several saucepans across the grill-top filled with various experimental broths/dips, and also cooking and eating outdoors.  Win.

Dessert?  Fruit and chocolate.  I made mine with hershey's chocolate syrup and some white chocolate bars.  Don't try to add caramel.  I looked that up after a terrible failure and realized that hot liquid caramel is kind of an art.  Mine turned into some sort of fibrous plastic.  Maybe I used cheap caramel

So I laid it all out in front of my wife using the fondue pot and a crock pot with a divided compartment.  Chocolate and cheese in the separated compartments of the crock, and fruit.  Outside of the cost of the appliances I can't even remember, whole bit cost me $25 and about 30 minutes to feed us both, and all I really did was pour stuff into hot things and wait before serving it next to raw/microwaved food.

1/4 cup dried milk or 1/2 cup fresh milk

**What it made of?**

* 1 tin/carton of chopped tomatoes

* 1 tin of mixed pulses - usually chickpeas, pinto beans, red kidney beans, adzuki beans, but you can use a tin of kidney beans if you prefer

* 4 sausages

* 1 onion

* ~200g wild rice - I say wild because I prefer the texture, but normal is fine

* 1 (bell) pepper

* 2 or 3 chilli peppers - depends on what sort they are and how hot you like it

* olive oil - you'll only need a tablespoon or so

* smoked paprika - optional

* chilli powder - optional

* salad - optional

**What am I cooking it with?**

* Large saucepan (for the stew)

* Small saucepan (for the rice)

* Frying pan/grill (depends which way you prefer to cook sausages)

* Sharp knife (for defence against intruders)

* Wooden spoon (for defence against easily-intimidated intruders)

* Can opener (for defence against armoured intruders)


**What do I do with all that?**

Start the sausages frying or grilling. Remember to keep checking to see when you need to turn them. Don't worry about cutting one in half to see if it's cooked through

Put the oil in the bottom of a saucepan

Chop your onion - I recommend in half down the middle

Throw the onion strips into the oil

Chop your pepper. When the onion is starting to change colour (but before it's completely brown)

Chop your chillis. When the onion is browned

Pour the tin of tomatoes into the vegetable pan and turn the heat down until it's bubbling gently.

*Decision time! How hot/smoky do you want it? Add paprika and/or chilli powder here if you wish.

Bonus decision! If you really want to
Remember to give it a good stir if you add anything.

It's probably about time to start your rice going. Wash it, set it heating up.

Sausages should be done by now. Remember when I mentioned cutting them into pieces? Yeah

*Protip: count the number of pieces you cut the sausages in to

Drain the water out of the tin of pulses

Simmer the whole lot until the rice is done (it should be firmer than normal rice

Drain the rice. This is where it pays to have removed some of the excess starch.

Plate it up (it's good to have a warm plate - you can use it to cover the pan as it simmers).

Try to keep the salad separate - it's nice to have some cold leaves to munch on if your mouth gets too hot.

Put some foil on a pan (so you don't have to clean it -- this is the extra-lazy step) and put the chicken in a 350 or so degree oven for about 50 minutes (until it is done)

**Fry**

Dip your chicken in something like milk and eggs (or even water) and then dredge it in something like flour or bread crumbs (crushed potato chips are awesome). Heat some oil in a pan and throw the chicken on it

",4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/ukw18/garlic_butter_canned_asparagus_and_artichoke/,"Picture: http://i.imgur.com/VGTXU.jpg

First time posting here, I wasn't sure whether it would be better for budgetfood or elsewhere :)

This isn’t exactly a specific recipe but I’d say by my measurements I made about 2 servings. I have leftover pasta but ate all the vegetables—but I’m pretty sure I just overate all the vegetables :)

Ingredients (that I used)
-	½ Vegetable Rotini
-	½ a can of asparagus 
-	½ jar of artichoke hearts 
-	Roughly 1 tablespoon butter (maybe a bit more)
-	2/3 tablespoon of minced garlic from a jar 

I used a random smattering of the following spices
-	Garlic powder (Probably unnecessary but I am an addict)
-	Onion powder (fairly small amount)
-	Italian Seasoning
-	A pinch of some of the seasonings from one of those bread seasoning packs
-	Crushed red pepper flakes (small amount)

I feel like this is very open to interpretation
Then put the butter in the pan on low to begin melting while I put the canned asparagus on a paper towel to dry it out a bit. I would recommend using more stalky parts than the tips because otherwise it can become a big clump in the pan, but it probably doesn’t really matter. I cooked the vegetables until they became a tiny bit browned.

It took the same amount of time to cook the vegetables for me as it did for the rotini to be finished.

I drained the rotini and put the veggies over it on the plate and let it cool for a minute while I melted some additional  butter and garlic in a pan to drizzle over the dish.

Since I have leftover asparagus but no more artichoke hearts tomorrow I am going to try replacing it with broccoli.

Feel free to make suggestions and hope someone enjoys!

Note: I'm not 100% sure on this, avocado exposed to air has a tendency to become brown.

* 50ml White Rice (I used Basmati)
* 50ml Red Lentils
* 400ml Water
* 1 teaspoon powdered chicken stock (or 1 chicken stock cube)

 1. Place ingredients in saucepan.
 2. Heat to boiling point.
 3. Reduce heat to low
 4. Simmer for 25 minutes.
 5. Serve.

Notes:

* Serves one adult - adjust servings to fit the amount of people being cooked for (double for two people
* Powdered beef stock can be substituted for the chicken stock in the ingredients.
* Powdered vegetable stock can be substituted for the chicken stock in the ingredients
* I measured the rice and lentils by using a shot glass of each.

What I ended up with was a nice, namely 4 parts liquid for every dry ingredient. For Oatmeal it is generally 4 parts water to one part oats.

Of course I have added lentils to the mix, are high in protein and when added to rice provide the body with a complete set of proteins that are missing if a person eats only staple food.

As I pointed out, and this was great for creating a fluffy rice and lentil dish. Today's recipe, however, doubles the amount of liquid (and that's the only real difference), which means that it produced a porridge consistency. As I did more research I discovered gruel, which seems to have an even greater proportion of liquid. Congee, a tasty Chinese gruel, probably with short grain rice.

What I'm also going to experiment with is the use of other grains. If I replace the rice/oats with millet, maize or wheat, will I end up with the same sort of result (though different in taste and consistency)? Moreover, will the liquid:dry ingredient proportions remain the same?

Let me just end here by saying that this sort of food is exceptionally cheap to buy and cook. It is high in complex carbohydrate and protein

Liquid:Dry Ingredient ratio

Steamed = 2:1

Porridge = 4:1

Gruel (Congee) = 8:1

1258615296.0,a5y4f,Spicey Tomato Ricey,jackarroo,10,3,3,"This is a dish I began making shortly after eating at a Japanese steakhouse. 

Ingredients:

Rice (minute

Diced Tomatoes (canned) I find that flavored canned tomatoes are best.

Optional:

Vinegar: a small amount to the desired texture (more important if a rice cooker is not available)

Mushrooms: (canned rinse well) available for as low as 30 cents per can.

Instructions: Begin by preparing rice as instructed. Possibly add Vinegar to rice approximately half way through to end up with a sticky texture. Remove rice from heat source and add diced tomatoes (liquid and all DO NOT DRAIN) to the rice.  Stir rice to complete mixing process (no need to be quick about it) If rice is still wet simmer lightly to texture desired.

how to do it:

SPICY PICKLES

In my other post I mentioned a vegetable slicer. I highly suggest getting one

Mexican Spicy pickles require:

- Cucumber
- Tapatio
- Limes 
- Pico de gallo
- Salt (Margarita or kosher preferred!)

Peel the skin off a cucumber with the aforementioned peeler

Squeeze in the juice of a lime, dip it in a little fancy salt and you're off for flavor country! I highly recommend AGAINST mixing the salt in with the cucumber, as it's easy to screw up by putting too much in. You do that and you just negated all those precious seconds you saved by getting the vegetable slicer in the first place.

and an AUTHENTIC MEXICAN CHICKEN MARINADE:

- Chicken breasts
- Pico de gallo
- Sunny delight

Take chicken

And finally, you already know that most food with lemon and chili added are fucking amazing though.

Heard of something called Bisquick? That's great for when you're lazy, within reason of course. This is a breakfast to impress. If you have an iron skillet that's the win condition for this

**BUTTERMILK PANCAKES**:

- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups white flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

USE FUCKING BUTTER AND NOT THAT MARGARINE SHIT. IT DOESN'T COOK RIGHT. Save that for toast

I bet you've never bought buttermilk before. Every supermarket has it

I find it's easiest to melt the butter ahead of time in the microwave and mix it in with everything but the flour and buttermilk. Pour in the buttermilk

Heat the pan on a medium flame and get some more butter in there. Start melting in and spinning it around. We don't want the batter to stick. A measuring cup works best for pouring the batter in

So, flip the pancake over with a spatula. You'll know if you did it too soon or too late by the color. If it looks like you want to eat it, it's the right color. If not, do better next time. The first pancake is usually the test model anyway as it's the coldest one at end of the whole ordeal, and you're dialing the heat in the pan.

This is the most important part. You need to get yourself a genuine bottle of honest-to-goodness maple syrup from New York or Vermont. This is what's going to make it fucking magical. If you like breakfast, too. I swear if you use that Mrs. Butterworth or Aunt Jemima crap you're dooming your breakfast to a world of pain and misery. DO IT. NO EXCEPTIONS. You came this far, go for broke. If you still refuse to buy it, at least get something non-maple, like one of those fruit pancake syrups. I had coconut syrup before. It was ok.

**EGGS**

We all have eaten eggs at some point in our lives, or hard-boiled.

HARD BOILED 

...is the easiest, put in your requisite amount of eggs and begin heating it. Once it starts boiling, you're done. Try it once, then adjust for timing on subsequent eggs. DON'T PUT THEM IN AFTER THE WATER IS BOILING! They're going to be all hard and have that greenish-farty coating around the yolk and have a talcum powder consistency.

FRIED

I just learned this and have yet to perfect it, it's not.) 

Heat the oil till it's just starting to get hot

SCRAMBLED

EVERYONE has had scrambled eggs, you start with a cold non-stick pan instead of a hot one. When you mix up your eggs ahead of time, pour in a little milk, whole cream, or pre-heated butter. You need something to thin out the eggs a bit, and any of this works. Pour the eggs in a pan and begin heating over a medium flame. Every minute or so, take the pan off the flame and mix it up with the spatula. You'll be doing this constantly. Do this until they're finished, and takes about 10-15 minutes if done right.

1348903555.0,10nrss,Delicious breakfast tacos in ten minutes flat,dwf,1,0,0,"So

I'm Canadian but my trips to Texas have inspired me to revolutionize my bacon and eggs delivery methodology in a way that I suspect would make Ron Swanson proud. I noticed [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/ypmks/easy_breakfast_burritos_xpost_rfrugal/) but honestly

I've ordered the instructions in approximately the order that has allowed me to get this over and done with as quickly as possible; yours will certainly vary a bit.

Non-food cooking pre-requisites:

 * A microwave
 * A stove
 * A pan of some kind (I use a stainless steel saucepan but whatever)
 * Two large plates for better time efficiency (at the expense of slightly more dishes to do)
 * one bowl (a mug will work in a pinch)
 * a fork
 * Paper towel

Ingredients:

 * Bacon (1 to 1.5 strips per taco) - I've started using the low sodium stuff and it tastes fine (still fatty though)
 * Large-size eggs (1 per taco)
 * 10-inch tortillas
 * Pre-grated Monterey Jack mix
 * some sort of pan grease (I like canola oil

Optional things that have worked well as additions in my trials:

 * black pepper
 * dijon mustard
 * hot sauce
 * jarred salsa

The cheese is key, the Monterey Jack mix livens things up over just plain cheddar, and saves me both time grating the cheese and the frustration of cleaning the grater afterwards (I actually enjoy grating cheese, cleaning up is the annoying part). You could save yourself a few cents to a few dollars (depending how often you make these) by pre-grating a lot of cheese and leaving it in a zip-lock bag in your fridge.

----------------

**Setup/baconing** (5-6.5 minutes)

The order here is somewhat arbitrary but you should experiment with how long it takes you to do things. Obviously

1. Lay out the strips of bacon parallel to each other between several sheets of paper towel (2-3 above
2. Turn on one of your stove burners to medium-low heat (I set my dial to about 4) and pour a *tiny* bit of canola oil into it. Tilt the pan around to coat the inner surface. Make sure to get the up the sides.
3. Shove the plate in and start microwaving the bacon on high for about 45-1:15 per strip. You'll have to experiment with this depending on your microwave's power and how crispy you like it.
4. Crack eggs into the bowl/mug and beat them with a fork. Bowl produces better results, as if you're rowing a boat, or turning a crank towards yourself. This lifts the egg up and gets some air bubbles into the mixture, which leads to a nice texture when you cook it. You can also use a [whisk](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/images/products/ikea--hjalte-balloon-whisk__0107942_PE257740_S4.JPG) for this purpose but with some practice a fork is usually sufficient unless you're making a ton of eggs. Whisks are also kind of a pain to clean. This should take 40 seconds max with a fork.
5. Lay out tortillas on one plate
6. The bacon should be about 2-3 minutes into cooking at this point and the pan should be fairly well heated up.

**Cooking the eggs and finishing up** (3.5-4.5 minutes)

1. Carefully pour the bowl/mug of beaten eggs into the pan. If it's hot enough you should hear a satisfying sizzle and see a layer of egg semi-solidify almost immediately. Since we're not making an omelette but rather some firm-ish scrambled eggs, you can use a whisk, but the fork will do the job. Tilt the pan around to get the more liquidy parts directly onto the pan's surface.
2. After they've started to firm up (you don't see a lot of liquid egg), it's hot) and swap in the tortillas and cheese. Microwave the tortillas on high for about a minute. This will melt the cheese a little and warm up the tortilla (potentially also making it softer if it's stiffened because you left the bag open the last time...).
3. Pull the eggs off the heat -- about 2.5-3 minutes is all they need in my experience, which should have soaked up a good amount of the grease. I usually throw it in the pan with the eggs for temporary storage while I throw out the paper towel and toss the plate in the sink/quickly rinse it.
4. Pull tortillas out

[The end result](http://i.imgur.com/ylLUQl.jpg) from one of my early attempts -- I usually make two

It takes a little bit of practice

Other notes:

 * If you've used enough grease then your pan should require *very* minimal scrubbing -- mainly needs a rinse and a quick wipe. The eggs should basically slide off of it. It doesn't take a lot of oil but you have to be sure to coat the pan rather thoroughly. Fill the pan with water and leave it on your stove (*off*
 * If you use butter (I did once
 * If you like your scrambled eggs softer and fluffier you can cook them for longer over a lower heat
 * Some people will hate on cooking bacon in the microwave. I contend that it is the best compromise between ease, brain-dead way to cook lots of meats and vegetables) sink $30 into a George Foreman Grill.

3/4 - 1 LB of ground beef. (see comments)  
30 oz of drained canned beans. (Two 15oz cans or 1 30oz can)  
Salsa. (see comments)  
A healthy amount of pepper.

A bit of clarification on this recipe. The salsa is basically there for spicyness and flavor. You can either go small jar for less spicyness or a larger one if you want more. If you are unsure what would be too spicy I would say a mild spicyness level would be either a tall jar of mild salsa or a short jar of medium salsa.

With the beef it tastes better the more you have so you would just want to buy what you can afford. I tend to find the cheapest prepackaged thing in the meat section which tends to be ~2/3 or 3/4 of a pound.

With pepper its the same as the salsa. Just use as much as tastes good. I tend to add maybe a little under a tablespoon? Haven't ever measured it. I shake till a pretty decent coating on top of pan ingredients then stir in. Can optionally add at the time of eating instead of in pan.

**Cooking instructions:**  
I tend to cook all of this on High to cook faster.

Cook the beef until browned (i.e. its cooked)  
Drain off grease (another preference
Drain the bean cans and add to pan
Cook until warm/hot  

**Reheating:**
I store leftovers in a bread loaf pan/ brownie pan covered.
For reheating I just plop in a bowl and microwave for 2-3 minutes

**Chicken Noodle Soup recipe:** (This serves a lot [maybe 5-6?])

2-3 cans chicken broth  
2 potatoes peeled and cut  
1-3 carrots cut into slices  
1 can cream of chicken soup  
1 bag of reames noodles

In this recipe you can wiggle around with the ingredient list quite a bit to make cheaper (e.g. add more potatoes and carrots

Only big thing of note in this list is the noodles. They are a frozen bag that is damn near impossible to find and I use the 12 or 16 oz bags. If you want to use this recipe first make sure that your local store has these or a similar type of noodle. They are known as egg noodles and their site actually has a locator function if you really want this specific type: www.marzetti.com/where-to-buy/

For the prep make sure you cut the carrots and potatoes small enough to actually fit on your spoon. Same with the chicken if you bought whole chicken.

**Note:** You don't have to cook like this but I suck at judging cooking times so doing chicken and potatoes/carrots separate makes it turn out better in the end.

Boil chicken in chicken broth till cooked.  
Remove chicken (fish it out and sit on a plate)  
Cook potatoes and carrots in broth until tender (can pull potatoes apart with a fork)  
Add everything else in (chicken
Cook at this point for ~10 minutes medium/medium high.

**Reheating:**

Same as with the chili. Microwave 2-3 minutes stirring once or twice mid way through.

**TL;DR**

1 LB boneless chicken  
3 cans chicken broth  
1 can cream of chicken soup  
2 Carrots  
2 potatoes  
1 16oz bag of noodles

Cook chicken in broth set chicken aside, cook for ~10 more minutes on medium/medium high.

I'd like to bring in a salad a few days a week to work. Get my nutrition on. Get my not spending money at lunch on.

What I know I can do now is go to the local market and get fresh greens or to the resident hippy market and get some spinach or whatever the spring mix is

What I'd really like is a simple suggestion for cooking chicken thighs. Idieally, have some for dinner, then save the rest to be sliced up and put in my salad. But real set it and forget it. I'm talking preheat, doctor, cook, remove(turn off oven), let cool, any suggestions for doctoring besides salt and pepper?

Last question

Any suggestions?

Enough rambling - here's the recipe (makes 2 servings).

**Ingredients**
1 ten ounce can of cream of mushroom soup. I got this from a liquor store for $2 each. .

2 fifteen ounce can of chopped mixed vegetables. I got this from the liquor store for $2. 

Make sure you have hot sauce available (I recommend one with very few ingredients - pepper, and maybe onion or garlic or something - but that's it, no ""natural flavors"" or odd-sounding chemicals.)

**Preparation**
Get a small pan or pot. Put all the vegetables in. Putall the mushroom soup in. Fill 1 empty vegetable can with water and put that in. Cook it on low heat for 5-10 minutes until it starts to boil. Take it off, then add more until it's got some strong flavor, but not so much that it's unpleasantly spicy.). Then add maybe 2 teaspoons of ground black/white pepper (I mean like the salt-and-pepper kind of pepper, not like the habanero/cayenne/etc. kind).

1353086135.0,13b1jc,it's me again. still lazy as F.,nukefudge,7,6,0,"hiya. my last submission was ""carrot + taco/salsa""...

this time

the first one is the least complicated:

* get a banana
* get some peanut butter (crunchy
* get a knife
* start eating the banana

i'm digging that one far too much

so

* get some cottage cheese
* get some prefried chicken (pivotal point
* get a fork
* get a spoon
* fork some chicken
* spoon some cottage
* combine inside your mouth

pretty good. as you see

*OH! just thought of something.*

BONUS THING:

* small fish meat balls (yeah
* mustard-based dill-dressing (dunno what this is called in english)
* combine

that last one is the easiest! :D",self,t5_2rcw0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/13b1jc/its_me_again_still_lazy_as_f/
