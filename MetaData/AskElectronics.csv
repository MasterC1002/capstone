What do you folks think? 

I guess I also am wondering what other kinds of inexpensive options there are for measuring inductance. I suppose I could use the formulas to wind up my own coils exactly as specified (known values) and then compare them to unknown coils using an oscillator and a meter. Or resistors using a ""Wheatstone bridge""?

Hello

I started by splitting the voltage regulator to a separate circuit because I've seen it done before and I appreciate the way it cleaned up the circuit. Did I go too far in making all peripherals separate schemas as well?

Also, I do however use GND symbols. Is this bad practice? 

It's done with EAGLE

Sometimes I see a box with a frame around schematics with an information area containing project name and author in the lower corner

Any advice/correction is welcome.

* Add protection diodes and proper power switch for battery. 
* Attach solenoid directly to battery via voltage divider or separate regulator. 
* Put a zener diode on the piezo element for spike protection. 
* Change the battery connector symbol to something showing polarity signs.)

There are a number of ""found"" electronic component packages all over the robot for detail and movie effect. These items range from various mosfets, to Bourns trimpots. However, there is one part in particular that has eluded us for **many** years now.

[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/UATt3g7.jpg)

[CAD Model](http://i.imgur.com/DZUSrub.png)

This part is used on top of the robot's head (3 times to be exact), and lower torso. It is used approximately 9 times on the entire robot, if not more. Because of how frequently it occurs on the robot, we think *it may have been something common or easy to obtain at the time*.

The part measures approximately 1.9""L x 1.165""W, as well as an IC.

It bears the numbers 1 through 6

It may have had a hinge on the sides. *It could have been two parts

We *may* be looking at the *bottom* of the part. We do not know.

I want to point out that **ALL** detail pieces used on the Johnny Five robots were electronic in some nature

Original material is unknown as the head of the robot was cast in fiberglass. It could have been metal or plastic.

Things we have considered it could be (and searched countless Ebay listings and Google Images):

* Micro/mini cassette tapes &amp; cases
* Vintage transistors
* Transformers
* Audio amplifier ICs
* Relays
* Circuit breakers
* DC to DC converters
* Connectors, various cable ends &amp; shells

2. Perhaps the signal from the radio station gets amplified by all of the steel cables that hold the bridge up and act as a giant repeater of sorts for the station.

This reminded me of Motorola application note AN1542
   
[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/mADRb.png) is my circuit schematic.  It works by installing a relatively large resistance (R1) in series with the existing 80uF filter capacitor (C2).  R1 is large enough to limit the inrush current to less than 2 amperes.  The equivalent series resistance of C2 is modeled by ""R_esr2"".   
   
As the DC voltage of the top rail rises, R3) voltage divider, driving capacitor C3.  Zener diode D5 protects the MOSFET's gate terminal and keeps VGS comfortably below the datasheet maximum.
    
Simulation results are shown in [(this plot)](http://i.imgur.com/WcKNz.png).  The blue trace is the top rail supply, until eventually the drain is a flatline waveform at ground.   
   
The MOSFET's gate is plotted in red.  You can see that it hasn't hit its asymptote even after 300 milliseconds.   
   
The simulation circuit includes a 0V voltage source ""Vxxx"".  This is merely a convenient way to monitor the current that flows from the bridge rectifier
   
I made a before-and-after [(plot)](http://imgur.com/IySbP.png) to show the effects of installing this circuit (R1 = 180 ohms, plotted in green).  The circuit schmeers out the charging time of filter capacitor C1, reducing the peak current at inrush.   
   
You'll notice that I added another
    
Summary of circuit modifications:
   
* Add a second filter cap (C1) whose value is ~ 5% of existing cap   
   
* Install an inrush current limiting resistor (R1) in series with the existing filter capacitor.  Choose R1 such that the inrush current is less than XX amperes
    
* Install an Nchannel MOSFET that shorts out the inrush current limiting resistor.   
   
* Drive the MOSFETs gate from a voltage divider (R2

I added the toroid because the guide suggested an inductor and it was all I had laying around. I don't know how to calculate the inductance on it

1370204279.0,1fjbrb,0v to 10v control from an Arduino,,14,0,19,"Hi all
I am in need of some help

I need a 0V to 10V signal to control a lighting fixture for a project

Currently I have a 12v battery that is regulated to 10v using a 500mW 10V zener diode with a 100 ohm resistor. 

I take the voltage drop across the diode to an 741 Op Amp +/- leads. 
The non inverting input is the Arduino PWM.
The inverting input is between two 100k ohm resistors
The output goes to the fixture controller. 

I just need someone to check through my work to make sure I'm on the right track.
Thanks for your help!

I will post a schematic in an edit.

I'm not clear on when to use a capacitor and of which size.  I know you can cause damage without them but I couldn't understand this case.  Wouldn't pin 18 still see 'High' without it?  Is it a voltage issue since it's from the 5v source?  Maybe it has something to do with the long lead wires and possible flickering of the signal from the sensor?

What would happen if it wasn't there at all?
What would happen if it was a 1μF capacitor?

so lets say i have an LED that has a forward voltage 1.9-2.0V and my netduino is putting out a voltage of 3.3v. Well my brain tells me i have to drop the voltage so put in a resistor. Now the LEDs i bought came with 200ohm resistors and they work. But why? How would i know if the resistors weren't included?

Now, a 150ohm resistor will limit the current to 8mA. Well doing that math, that was taking ohms law (3.3 - 2.1)/150 = .008. But what does that mean? does that mean the LED changed the voltage?

The book goes on to sat that 8mA is the maximum current rating for the digital pins. Wouldn't that mean it's putting out that much to begin with?

I hope my statements clarify my confusion to those who are knowledgeable. It bothers me that i can't take a component that says it needs 1.2v and know how to change 3.3v to 1.2v or something similar. Do i really have to have a voltmeter or can this be done with math?

I am trying to find the best component to drive a high amp PWM signal. My application will require ~30V and up to 20amps (100% duty cycle.) 

The highest amp optoisolator I can find is rated for a max of ~5amps which means id have to string a bunch of them together.

Obviously there are SSR (solid state relays) which could handle the task with respects to current

-For reference I am using a PWM controler with a 12bit resolution so I ""think"" that means I need something which can ramp up/down inside of ~100us

-I also need something that is relatively simple as ill need to make quite a few of these circuits and if I need to have 10 components just to do this once its going to be a bit cost prohibitive...

Components used are:

R1 = R2 = 240 ohm

T1 = T2 = 300 volts

D1 = D2 = 15 A

C1 = 2 microfarads

L1 = 6 loops in 3/8"" pipe

L2 = 750 microhenry toroidal inductor

I'm using a 12 V

Anyhow, and when I switch on the power supply it apparently trips a circuit breaker as the fan starts for a fraction of a revolution before the power supply turns off and then it won't turn on for several minutes after this happens.  At 12 volts that instruction site seems to imply about 4 amps, which my power supply should be able to supply handily.  I tried hooking up a few 1000 microfarad capacitors in parallel with the power supply (as suggested in their troubleshooting section, to deal with initial surge current) but the same thing happened.

1) Is this indeed a circuit breaker tripping?  I don't know what else it could be.
2) How is the current draw of an induction heater determined?
3) How can I get this to work?

Edit: Tested MOSFETs and diodes, no change.  I think I'm going to get a new power supply that's a little more transparent.

I've been tasked with creating a 12VDC (automotive) to 200VDC 50W PSU, or maybe even flyback? I'm flexible, but the only requirement is the output has to isolated, so it will need a transformer.

So, and no indication as to the V.uS product. Coilcraft are terrible at giving you information about there transformers. The application note to go along with this transformer has uses a V.uS of around 80@500kHz,50%Ds, which seems reasonable but it means it isn't going to cut the mustard for my application. On closer inspection I found a [planar transformer prototyping kit](http://www.coilcraft.com/planarkit.cfm) using a similar core which gave more information about the transformer, namely the effective area of the core and some vague indication it was using a ferrite core, such that you could calculate the number of primary turns required for a particular V.uS. And for switching 75V@500kHz 50%Ds, who would have guessed that you need 8 turns? I wish coilcraft were more thorough with their documentation.

So I went searching

* Are there any off the shelf transformers out there that are suitable for this type of application?

3. Is there anything else that I am missing that might cause an issue?

**Edit: Now I have a few new questions.**

When I was drawing out the schematic for the board I found that the collector on the TO-3 packages has a [piece of plastic](http://i.imgur.com/zCdIU.jpg)? or something between it with some thermal grease. Does that mean that the collector should connect to ground if I am replacing it with the smaller TO-220 package?

[This](http://i.imgur.com/c7NcL.jpg) resistor is connected only on one side. The other end terminates without connecting to anything else. At the risk of sounding stupid is it safe to assume this is a ground? I have never seen something like that before.

I had my scope grounded to the negative lead of the battery terminal (as that's where all ground traces/wires seem to go) and probing things from there. Vcc on the misbehaving Attiny looked fine -- there was a little bit more noise when the motor was running, which eventually just turned into me probing whatever I could hoping something would jump out at me.

Something did.

I noticed that probing the ground pin on the IC didn't show a flat line -- on the contrary, and got a fuzzy (so, noisy) but fairly flat line. Then I triggered the motor.

So, was absolutely stellar. **But when the motor activates, it's putting a large upward spike on ground, causing a brownout in effect from the other side of the circuit!**

On a warm summerday... Na

I found my stock CPU cooler one day lieing around somewhere and thought: Why not try putting that on your board and find out where to put it best in terms of cooling.

So I plugged it in (to a 3-pin connector) and was booting up my PC but I just realized that I don't know the usual temperatures and the cooler was still plugged in (which would mislead my messures). So because I've read about people unplugging their fan while the system is running without any troubles I thought I'd do the same

Then after about 2 or 3 more seconds my PC suddenly turned off

My heart froze for a second and I knew right away that this was not going to end up well. I unplugged my PSU and everything and suddenly thought... where does this stench come from?!

Things got serious on this when I realized the stench came from the CPU. I put my PC down and started to unplug my CPU to find... nothing. I thought the CPU was fried or something of that kind but no visual damage.

I was a little confused at that time but plugged in nothing but my CPU and the power supply. It started spinning and I suddenly heard a rather loud bang. I was shocked and instantly unplugged my PSU... Right after that I thought because the pieces are dead already I'll give it another try

Turned the system on again for around 10 seconds

After this I got a new motherboard from a friend for a good price and my CPU was indeed undamaged, even overclocked it and it's all fine.

Now there is still one thing I'm wondering about: What killed the motherboard and what happened exactly?!

I already posted this on http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1hspio/what_should_i_do_with_my_dead_motherboard/ with another intent but thought I'll give it another try here.

So what I'm trying to do, as well as DSD. I know I said just above I don't believe in audiophile kind of nonsense, so it might come as a surprise that I'm even using DSD or 24/192. Well, the point of this is to find out once and for all whether I or anyone I know *can* actually hear the difference. So with that out of the way let's begin.

To get the audio from the computer to the DAC, so this should isolate it from the jitter inherent to USB. Now, for DSD, this presents an interesting problem. Luckily, there is a relatively easy solution. There is some firmware which supports something called DoP, which essentially transports DSD data over PCM frames. The XMOS chip will the convert it in to true DSD and spit it out, to be sent to the DAC. 

Now, if anything, do I need to do to make sure that it is jitter free before reaching the DAC? I know a fair amount of designs use an asynchronous sample rate converter (ASRC) to upsample to the highest sampling rate (24/192 in this case probably). How do I know whether this will attenuate the jitter? Supposedly, the AD1963 is much better than the SRC4192, but I can't figure out why merely from the datasheets. As for DSD, well, I obviously can't use an ASRC with it. TI has some products they call ""jitter cleaning clocks"" which are two-pass PLLs. Would those work? If so, why wouldn't they work and what would?

I hope that's everything,False,self,t5_2se13,False,design,,t3_1fldkj

So here's the short and sweet version of the story: My sister/brother in law somehow acquired an old pinball machine. As far as I understand, to ""do whatever you want with it"". Said younger sibling is kind of an idiot, so he decides smashing it is a good idea. Luckily, he's an idiot, so he doesn't do a very good job of smashing the machine. It then got left in the rain (3-5 days light rain) until I spotted it and asked if I could have it. As far as I can tell, the insides stayed dry(ish). 

So now I have this awesome pinball machine and I would very much like to get it up and running again, nothing happens, regardless of the on/off switch's position.

Anyone have an educated guess as to what's wrong? And what parts I would need to replace? And maybe a ball park on the cost to get this thing up and running?

There is a system which gives certain voltage output which is the error in a system. It is a sinusoidal wave the peak to peak value of which is my error voltage. I have to take that error voltage and then give a voltage signal to an electronically controlled attenuator which then attenuates my system and changes the error voltage. Obviously I have to minimize the attenuator voltage. But here are the problematic parts:

1. There is a error null point of voltage which when given to the attenuator will nullify the error

1. The error null point may change change while the operation of the system due to different things. That may create some problem too.

Can someone help me design an electronic systems (maybe using op-amps?) to solve this problem?

Edit: We have a microcontroller based system for this already. It uses the ADC of the controller and a DAC to give the voltage to the attenuator. But I just thought maybe there are simpler ways to do this.

 I had the code uploaded and was testing it while it was plugged into the computer and everything was great. I decided to test it with a 9V regulated wall wart and for whatever reason the buzzer stopped working. It actually started making fizzing noises. My fist thought was I messed up when I soldered the barrel jack connector on so I ran the power straight to the Vin pin. No luck. I tried using a 9v battery, came back and tested it again but the same problem started happening.  

 I'm really not sure what to do next. I might try running a resistor to ground before the transistor but I was doing that originally and couldn't get the transistor to switch. It seems so strange that it works perfectly fine when it's plugged into the computer but not when it's plugged into the wall. 

Does anyone have a clue what's going on? I'm using an Arduino Leonardo if that makes a difference. 


Update_1: So I wont be able to test until tomorrow

I was testing it some more and I noticed the relay had some trouble reliably switching on. I think this could be a transistor problem ([I'm using this one](http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/2N6426-D.PDF)) but that still doesn't explain why it works fine with USB. I think the only thing that really explains that would be a decoupling problem or a problem with the power supply ( even though I tested it with a 9v battery too).

I initially wanted to build a really small passive circuit (with SMD components) so that the package could be small and just added to the end of a headphone jack.

I initially did a test and found out what ratios she needed to hear a balanced sound. Using winamp

I threw together a quick voltage divider on a breadboard as follows (excuse the paint drawing): http://i.imgur.com/NnvrfrG.png

The problem happens when I plug in the actual headphones... the load makes the right channel jump down to about 100mV. I should probably mention that my headphones have a 300 ohm impedance. This happens with other headphones too

I realize that the resistors are probably eating up the current the headphones need to be driven with so my question is: is there any way to do this with passive components or would I have to make some sort of amplifier (i'm trying to avoid powered circuits...) for this to function correctly?

In simple terms:
1. Look at 4Ah and get it's value (say 40h on the first cycle)
2. Whatever that value go to the register address of the same value and load the data stored in that address.
3. Send that data to the output

The worst-case forward voltage drop at the right brightness is about 3v2 and the rest of the application runs off a 3v3 low-noise boost regulator - my secret hope is that there's something with FETs on the high and low side that will be able to drive the LED with near the full input voltage if it has to - I would love to avoid having a boost regulator (and all that noise) just for the LED.

I am a student currently taking a 2 year Electronic Technology degree.  My instructor has asked me to help him with a project that he would like to get up and running for the open house the program is having next month.  His project is to have a robotic arm hold a shot glass, that has multiple positions to rotate to so the arm can dispense a variety of shots at choice. The top part of the shot dispenser rotates 360 degrees, with the base and shaft stationary. There is some sort of ball bearings that sit on top of the shaft that allows the top to move.  My instructor has given me carte blanche to do what I want with it, and modify it as I need to. As shown in one of the pictures, the metal arms that hold the bottles of alcohol are only held on by two screws attached to the ball bearings, which seems like it will give easy access to somehow attach a motor.

The problem is I don’t know very much about motors, servo motors, ect, and which should be used for certain purposes. I have asked him briefly about the power and controls, and he said that they will be controlled by a PLC and not to worry about that part of it.  He said just figure out how to attach a motor to it that meets the criteria with the multiple positions, and others will take care of the rest. He also said any parts and materials will be supplied; I just need to give him a parts list order.  I have attached some pictures of it as well as a Youtube video that shows the same model and how it operates. 

So, and let me know if there are any other questions.

-----------------------------------------------

**EDIT: Conclusions**

From what I have gathered so far the reasons that it is NOT ok to run an opto-triac without a second load triac are the following 

* The internal Triacs are very low current
* The inrush current of an inductive or resistive load can be many times operating current (see previous)
* They are only designed to switch another Triac.

It is however done on a breadboard. The circuit is nearing completion and I'm writting about how it works. I am unable to understand why the resistors need a 470 Ohm resistor or why the switches need a 1.5k. 

I will now present to you what I think is needed and hopefully you will be able to tell me why I am wrong. From what I know LEDs have a typical forward voltage of about 3.3v if I run a 5v across the them that means there is (5-3.3)/current = resistor. From what I know 30mV is the maximum current allowed over a resistor. Therefore 1.7/3x10^-3 = 56.67 Ohms but instead there is a 470 Ohm.

**Project introduction:** 
&gt;The Very Simple Computer (VSC)
&gt;was designed in class and breadboarded in
&gt;the laboratory by the students of an
&gt;undergraduate-level computer architectures
&gt;course. The computer uses small and
&gt;medium scale TTL integrated circuits. It has
&gt;an 8-bit word with a 3-bit op-code and a 5-bit
&gt;address
&gt;words of memory. The VSC uses a rocker
&gt;switch input and directly monitors (with LEDs)
&gt;the bus for the output. This relatively
&gt;inexpensive project (&lt;$100 including power
&gt;supply
&gt;hardware) is a natural for a small computer
&gt;science department on a limited budget. In
&gt;addition to providing the students with a
&gt;sense of accomplishment
&gt;many practical architecture issues not
&gt;encounted when using laboratory simulators:
&gt;This paper outlines a method for incorporating
&gt;the design of the VSC into
&gt;regular classroom lectures
&gt;number of recommendations for instructors
&gt;who would consider using the VSC in their
&gt;own course.

&gt;A number of educators have used simple
&gt;computer designs to provide a basis for
&gt;classroom instruction. Notable examples are
&gt;Sajjan Shiva’s ASC (A Simple Computer)l
&gt;and A. K. Dewdney’s SCRAM (Simple but
&gt;Complete Random Access Machine).z While
&gt;these computers have no practical purpose
&gt;beyond their educational value
&gt;candidates for classroom laboratory projects.
&gt;While the design of the VSC was heavily
&gt;influenced by these two machines
&gt;decision to take the system to hardware
&gt;produced a slightly different set of design
&gt;goals. First of all
&gt;the ASC. This decision was based on the
&gt;simpler hardware configuration resulting from
&gt;the smaller instruction set. Next
&gt;provides 32 words addressable memory
&gt;rather than 16 as with the SCRAM. This was
&gt;done to provide an example of chip-select
&gt;circuit design in the memory unit. A block
&gt;diagram of the VSC is shown in Figure 1. The breadboarding of each VSC
&gt;functional module is assigned to one or two
&gt;students as individual projects. These
&gt;assignments are given with a design specification
&gt;indicating the format of inputs and
&gt;outputs
&gt;required outputs of each module. The
&gt;modules are tested independently and
&gt;passed by the instructor. Toward the end of
&gt;the course
&gt;module integration. The integration effort is
&gt;one of the most beneficial laboratory
&gt;exercises of the course

&gt;instructor.

As far as I understand, it's just the light is spread over a larger area. Is this right?

It's just that to give the most even illumination I would have thought a panel of LEDs with the biggest view angle (the 500mCd 170deg ones) would be better (assuming I put a mirrored or white edges around the panel to reflect back the light that would be lost) but I wanted to make sure that the total illumination wouldn't be greatly reduced.

I am building a circuit where most of the components work on 5V but one, which, correct me if I'm wrong, could be quite noisy when the car is running.

The question here is: How do I create the regulation circuit for maximize stability and avoid noise?

I've seen that, one that takes ""anything"" and outputs 5v, and the second one that gets the +5V from the first one and outputs a +3V3, whose output is further stabilized by a 1uF capacitor.

I was thinking that this solution is better than making the 3V regulator also taking directly the battery 12V as input. Is this correct?

I've seen some DIY hot foam cutters made from guitar strings and a car battery charger or a pc power supply. My question is how can I figure the temperature of the wire based on it's resistance and move backward from there. (does that make sense?)

Can I:
Take my guitar wire and hook it up to a frame jig and then take a multimeter and measure the resistance between the connection terminals. Then using that resistance reading

If it is possible to be calculated like that I should be able to also do the reverse correct? State with my resistance at X value

Do these equations exist? Or does the heat produced by resistance vary too much by materiel? Are certain materials specific heat reactions charted so that you could guesstimate a close temperature?

I've built a simple sample circuit on a breadboard, and Drain to a 10ohm resistor then through an LED then to ground.  I have a simple program that turns the PIC pin high/low.  But, nothing happens at the LED.  I tested the program with the LED on the PIC pin, and it's fine.

So

* it normally doesn't pass any current
* if the Gate sees a voltage above its threshold

Things I'm wondering about when I think why it might not work:

* where does the current come from to drive the LED?  1Davide said to connect the Source to the ""negative supply"".  I interpreted that to mean **ground** - but maybe he meant the +5V supply?  In that case
* when I set a PIC pin ""high"", then the Gate won't open.  If I read the datasheet right, this MOSFET's Gate threshold is 0.8V minimum.

I'm sure this is probably easier than I'm making it out to be

Thanks for your help.

I tried it with this MOSFET instead:  http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/1025893-mosfet-n-ch-60v-1-1a-to92-3-zvn4306a.html

I'd love to know why IPS screens seem to be so prone to this ""yellowing"" issue with the tint.

To be clear: I'm *not* talking about subjective preferences between ""cooler"" and ""warmer"" colour temperatures etc.

I'm also *not* talking about backlight bleed or even ""glue"" drying

I've had and seen *many* IPS based displays from phones to computer monitors and they almost ALL have this issue to some degree or other. 

The internet is awash with forum posts where people with iPhones, that it's personal preference, that it's not really there, that it's ""normal"" and you'll get used to it, that you should switch to amoled etc etc. The reality is that it *is* there and to the extent that a lot of people can see it and have a problem with it (understandably and me included), it's very frustrating. 

I've currently got a Nexus 4 I'm relatively happy with but I had to go through about 8(!) returns to get one I found ""acceptable"" and even then the issue is still there.

It seems to be that the ""yellowing"" is normally more pronounced on one side of the screen to the other in a kind of gradient

My theory is that most people simply don't care and see their screens as ""good enough"" which is why manufacturers have never got round to addressing the issue which is looooongstanding.

I'm about 90% sure it's something to do with the nature of the manufacturing process or even something inherent in IPS technology. *Something* is causing it and I'd love to know

1372820875.0,1hjkdt,Trying to wrap my head around floating grounds and what happens when they are connected...,J_F_Sebastian,8,2,23,"I'm trying to wrap my head around floating ground circuits

Let's say I build some circuit, which only has two pins that go into the mains outlet.  My circuit has a ground rail and, say, a +9V rail.  My understanding is that the 9V rail is 9V higher than the ground rail, in relative terms, but the actual absolute potential of both rails is arbitrary.  My ground rail is ""floating"" and is not guaranteed to be at the same absolute potential as either the netural or safety earth pin of my outlet.  Is this correct?

Side question: under real world conditions

Now let's say I build a second wallwart powered circuit, the ground rail's absolute potential is arbitrary.  Also, I assume that in general there is no guarantee of any kind of fixed relationship between the absolute potential of the two ground rails, and one may be higher than the other.

Suppose I connect the grounds of these two circuits together (let's say one is a synthesiser of some kind and the other is an amplifier).  This is a perfectly ordinary thing to do and I've done it before and I understand that, i.e. the two ground rails end up at equal potentials.  But what is actually *happening* here?  At the instant I make the connection, does current briefly flow from whichever ground happens to be higher to the other one, before the equalise?  Part of me feels like it must because there was, at least initially, a potential difference between the two grounds.  But where does that current flow, I mean it needs to flow in a loop

Now, and I understand that usually the ground clip of the scope probe is shorted internally to the mains safety earth.  Let's suppose I connect that to the (now common) ground bus of my two circuits, so I can measure the signal at some point inside one of them.  The common ground of my two circuits then shifts to equal the earth potential supplied by the mains, right?  And that's just no big deal?

I guess I'm confused because I've read that if you accidentally connect the ground clip of a scope probe to something that's at a high voltage relative to safety earth then you can blow up your scope because you've created a short circuit for that high voltage and you get a whole lot of current flowing.  That's bad.  But I feel like there's no conceptual difference between doing that and connecting the ground clip to the ground rail of something powered by a wallwart

Is it just the case that the absolute potential of the ground output of a wallwart is never very far away from your mains earth potential

But even if that was the case...when you short the floating ground to safety earth, it just drives a whole pile of current through your scope until something burns out.  This feels like a quantitative difference in voltage causing a qualitative change in behaviour, which feels counterintuitive.

Does the high voltage not simply get pulled down to safety earth because there's some force acting to actively maintain that potential

Sorry for the fairly long and rambling question.  I'm not entirely sure exactly which concepts it is that I'm confused about.  An attempted TL;DR:

* Is it true that floating potentials can simply be pulled up/down to match earth just by shorting them to earth, physics-wise?
* If that is true
* If that isn't true,False,self,t5_2se13,False,theory,,t3_1hjkdt

1371451200.0,1gi2fh,Battery pack for a MP3 speaker system,pedroah,8,1,3,"I have a MP3 player speaker system from Goodwill that has a 3.5mm jack.  It includes a power supply that's rated 12V DC 2.5A and the label on the speaker indicates the same.  I want to take this radio on the road with me and run it off batteries and currently trying to figure out what I can do.  My only requirement is no SLA because it's too heavy for backpack carry.

I got brief access to a bench top DC power supply and for the most part

Additionally I figured out that the speaker system automatically shuts off when I dialed the voltage down to 6V.  After it shut off at 6V, if any, degradation in audio quality and I had it running continuously at maximum volume probably for 20 or 30 minutes at 9V and the current was still around 0.25 to 0.5A most of the time.

What options do I have to power this?  I was thinking either AA NiMH since I have plenty of those

Originally I was thinking I would need to use a voltage regulator, the voltage should be around 9.6V nominal and 3x18650 would be around 10.8 to 11.1V but would be 12.6 initially.  For 4x 18650 though, I think I would use a regulator because initial voltage would be 16.8 and then dropping to 14.8.  I did not test above 14V.  I'm leaning towards the NiMH currently because I already have the batteries, and all I really need is a battery holder a plastic case and a few other things like a switch, barrel connector, and a few wires.  I'm thinking for what I'm doing it will be safe to not use a relay.

According to my math from using the bench DC power supply

My AA batteries are 1.2V and around 1.9Ah.  So 8 of them would be 9.6V and about 18Wh.

The schematic can be seen here:

So

However, this to me says it *should* be a good motor, since it's working as an AC generator when it's spun.  I should note that a kid helping me was only able to generate almost a volt when spinning it as hard as he could.

How I came to the suspicion that it is this motor:  The dehumidifier would seemingly run normally if it was left off for many hours, I determined the compressor's thermal protection was kicking in - it was getting HOT, and the blower was never turning on.  I also tried high and low fan speeds.

I then connected my multimeter to the PCB where this fan is connected and found it was supplying 120v when connected to the Black/Yellow lines as I was trying to test.

So

Essentially I need to create a circuit that can switch on/off a laser diode but importantly once it is switched off it must send a mouse click or key stroke to begin analysis in the instruments software. It is vitally important that the timing of the turning off / starting analysis sequence is reproducible.

So far what I have done is create a simple toggle switch in a box that actuates one relay that controls the laser diode. That bit works perfectly.

The problem I am having is that it is very difficult to trigger a computer to 'click'. By 'click' I mean short out some contacts and then open them again, HOWEVER... just my luck that it actuates TOO quickly and the computer is unable to detect it. Unfortunately, lowering the voltage or current makes it unable to actuate and I have been unable to mechanically manipulate it to be 'slower'.

Current basis of operation:
Toggle switch on: Laser relay closed
Toggle switch off: Laser relay open
Toggle switch transitioning momentarily: Laser relay losing power

However I got a pcb made to make it smaller and I can't figure out what is wrong with the audio stage of the circuit.  I have narrowed the problem down to the microphone and gain stage but can't figure out why I am getting a dc voltage of 0.5V on the input of my op-amp (pin 3 on LM358).  I already tried replacing C2 but that did not fix it.  I am assuming that I have blown the op-amp and will have to replace it



For this project 110V A/C @ 2000Hz is used to drive the el wire and I have one of the A/C lines tied to ground to switch the triacs.  Would this cause it to fail?
