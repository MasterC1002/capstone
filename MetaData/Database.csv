1319503593.0,lnskq,"SQL Server's Transaction Log - Why you need one, and what it does.",taejim,47,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/lnskq/sql_servers_transaction_log_why_you_need_one_and/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

The transaction log is perhaps one of the most misunderstood parts of SQL Server's architecture

**Why do we need a transaction log?** Consider the ACID properties of transactions: Atomicity, Durability (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). Durability is the property that the transaction log assists us with - ""once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so."" The effect of this, is once your database engine tells you that the transaction is complete, it HAS to stay that way. This means that the transaction must be stored on disk, otherwise, if you have a power failure and your change was only in memory on the database server

OK, you can fit about 400 rows on the page). Pages are the smallest unit of reading and writing, so if you modify one row on the page, the entire 8 KB page is written back to disk. 

Imagine if you update 100 rows in a single transaction (**UPDATE Products SET Price = Price + 1**). Some of these rows could be at the start of the data file, write the updated page to disk (an 8 KB write), and move onto the next location, waiting for the disk to spin, and the disk head to move each time. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Enter the transaction log. Instead of making a randomly placed 8 KB write for each page that needs changing, you don't need to wait for the disk head to move to the next position to write the next change - the next position is already right under the disk head. This means you can lay the changes down on disk very rapidly, which keeps the end user happy. 

While we are writing the change to the transaction log, then all the dirty data pages in memory will be lost, but we have a record of all changes that occurred in the database. Each operation in the transaction log has a Log Sequence Number (LSN), which is like the odometer in your car - it's a unique, ever increasing number. Each data page records which LSN was last used on that page, and when the database starts up, it will scan through the transaction log, the Lazy Writer successfully wrote that page back to disk). If it hasn't

Note that we can also rollback a transaction. This is controlled by the transaction log storing the previous value as well as the changed value. If the transaction is rolled back

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

To re-iterate

1. Performance
2. Durability

So, or structural changes (grow a data file, or create new objects). This also gives us the ability to replay any operation that occurred in the database. If we take a copy of the database (a full backup), and then have copies of the transaction log from that point on, we can replay every operation and bring the database back to a consistent state at any point in time. For example, if you accidentally dropped a table, you can bring the database back to the point just before (either by a time (2:45pm), and recover the data.

Another option is the concept of ""log shipping"". This is where you take your transaction log backups

This is a good place to take a rest.  

--------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid running out of space

The **Full** recovery model puts all control onto the DBA. When you backup the transaction log, because it may need all the log records to roll back this transaction after the backup. If you don't back up the transaction log while in the Full recovery model, your log will continue to grow until you run out of space.

The **Simple** recovery model makes every thing easy. You don't back up the transaction log. When the log runs a ""checkpoint"" operation (triggered either by the DBA running ""CHECKPOINT"", and the transaction log will be truncated (again, up to the point of the earliest open transaction). As you are not taking backups of the transaction log, you have no ability to restore to a specific point in time, as you don't have a complete log chain from the time of a full backup. The Simple transaction log only stores enough information to recover in the event of a loss of power.

There is another recovery model, but used when loading a large amount of data. It will log the changed extents (an extent is 8 pages, or 64 KB). This can be a lot more efficient than logging ""now change this row, now change this row, now change this row"", which could add up to more than 64 KB inside the log.

Every company has them - the group that's building ""The Data Warehouse"" that will answer all questions

- OLAP
- Analytics
- Dashboard

Here's my problem - in seventeen years

In every case, or I wasn't allowed access to it, or they would have to build me a datamart that would cost tens of thousands of dollars. 

So all this time and money went into something that probably serves an executive dashboard, but the DW mafia continued to block any attempts to form any other kind of analytics. My most recent customer had SQL Server Analysis Services set up, SharePoint and PerformancePoint deployed, and the Cognos Mafia *still* prevented them from actually building cubes. Twelve months later, Cognos hasn't provided anything of value - they're still in analysis. 

Far too often it just seems like DW initiatives are ""because the business needs a data warehouse"" without any actual *business* justification. They completely lose sight of why they exist. 

I think I'm going to do more research to find companies that ignored the idea of a DW and just built data marts as needed. Or see if there are any groups that grew a DW organically - creating data marts

 * Learn to take Filesystem snapshots with your relevant OS
 * Use the built-in backup tools
 * learn to restore a database USING TRANSACTION/BINARY LOGS. People will think you are a wizard when you can restore a level 0 backup from the previous night

My last words of advice, and a lot of the lower level tuning needed in your favourite UNIX/Linux + filesystem combo. Lazy non-normalized databases are never a good excuse.

I've been noticing the NoSQL hype, when performance issues create the need, one sticks with a more mainstream SQL server and just avoids the costly parts? Would I not get basically the same advantages?

Or, explain to me under which conditions I should be considering a NoSQL variant and why?

Since the installation failed halfway through, copy it to a drive on another computer in that VM network, then start it from there. This installer allowed me to uninstall Oracle, but of course Oracle left remnants of itself behind.

I tried to install Oracle again but those remnants prevented the listener from installing properly. I decided to uninstall completely and remove all traces of Oracle by using some instructions from the net.

Nature of the data is:

 - text label (up to 200 characters)
 - value (int)

Each data row belongs to a category, all tables are InnoDB (although I'm not using foreign keys).

The query that will be used most on the data is:

    select ref.label
         
         , cats.type, cats.positions, cats.completed
         
      from ref ref
      join data data
        on data.data_id = ref.id
      join data_categories cats
        on cats.country_code = data.country_code
       and cats.category = data.category
       and cats.type = data.type
       and date(cats.date_checked) = date(data.date_checked)
     where ref.label = 'my data label'
    
ref.id and data.data_id are of binary(16) type and store an unhexed MD5 hash of the label; the label reoccurs in the data set - 189759 unique labels in 3877629 data items and there won't be many new labels.

Indexes

- data.data_id - non unique
- ref.label - unique
- (data_categories.country_code, non unique

Here's the EXPLAIN on the query - [pastebin raw](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Hzy52wSf) and profiling info from phpmyadmin [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3OWVU6w.png). It takes ~5 ms to execute this query over 3877629 data items on a freshly restarted database with no other load on the machine but that's my PC with ssd disk

5 ms is good

One obvious optimization would be to normalize category data. I took the current approach because data table contains all the relevant information now

I know it's a long post but I didn't know how to explain myself better. I would greatly appreciate any advice on the issue

Your best bet is to do two things:  research the occupation and research the majors.
 
You can go to www.onetonline.org and type in Data Base Engineer in the keyword section.  You will discover information on tasks, but also for a multitude of other occupations.

I am beginning to worry. I feel like even with a 4.0 in my major, let me reword that. I know a lot about computers, just nothing specialized. I know a little bit about a variety of different things, but there isn't one subfield of computer science that I feel I particularly excel in. I am looking for a subfield of computer science to focus my studies on and specialize, but I don't know what that field should be!

I haven't actually been tasked to fix this, and since I use this terrible piece of software dozens of times a day, I have the incentive to do something about it.
 
I have an amateur-level knowledge of programming (pretty much just Java and JS though)
 
I need to print invoices for customers (for paying landing fees,"" etc.
 
The reason I'm erring on Zoho already after playing with it some

Each flight has an arbitrary number of miscellaneous charges that may be added to it, then click a ""+"" button which will add an identical field from which I can select another misc charge, ad infinitum.
 
I certainly have the programming skills to build a database client, I don't know what I should be using for the back end.

My first stop was SQL Server Express since it's free, awful solution). However, it's possible this ""movement"" data constitutes commercially sensitive information, so I'd like to explore local storage options as well.

The system would likely only be used by ~10 users on site, because I'd like a web-based component to allow pilots to book flights online. The airport only averages about 150-200 flights a day, so I wouldn't expect this database to be updated or accessed by more than, say, 10 users simultaneously.

Since the changing definition of a schema directly affects the data the database holds and it can render a sql dump at least hard to use.

Do you just keep the latest version of a schema or you just add your table / database changes at the bottom of your sql dump ? Does this problem (or solution ) even has a name ?


EDIT1: Thanks for the answers. They are most usefull. As a followup
Is there a DBA topic on this matter? I get the feeling that there needs to be some information that is platform independent ?

I would like to create a query to show the ip, broadcast) and vlan id.
My query that is failing (with error Error: near line 150: ambiguous column name: subnet.network)

    /* Trying to get IPs and VLANs */
    SELECT ip.ip, subnet.broadcast, subnet.prefix, subnet.netmask, vlan.vlan

    LEFT JOIN vlan_ips ON vlan.id = vlan_ips.vlan_id
    LEFT JOIN subnet ON vlan_ips.subnet_id = subnet.id;

The error is rather ambiguous because if i remove subnet.network I get an error that another column name is ambiguous.  

I think my problem is I'm not groking the left join

Ok

I don't really want to use an integer because if I want to just get the username along with the other data in the main table I also have to look at the other table to see what the integer corresponds to.

I was designing a database for an MMO (not actually making one just designing a database to test my ability) I was wondering if there was a better way to keep track of player items than having a many to many table relation from something like a Character table to an Item table.

1347641062.0,zvto7,I work for an international Architectural Lighting Design firm and we're experiencing growing pains on the tech side. I need some guidance on getting a consultant to set up a project management/history database and front-end. ,Xeracy,8,1,13,"Fist off

Our company's basic task is to specify lighting products (light fixtures and control systems) for architectural projects (hotels, place those elements on architectural plans, and maintain associated lists/schedules (quantity of fixtures, general circuiting, power usage for meeting energy codes) of all of this. Currently we are making and maintaining all these schedules manually in Excel and its wasting a lot of time and effort. 

It is my opinion that we would want some form of database (cloud based, have access to a central repository of projects and a front-end interface *that is easy for a designer to use* while working on their individual projects.

I am creating an outline of how we would want our database to be organized and how that information would need to be referenced/maintained. Basically, but I dont think they need to be pointed out in this post. 

I am the closest thing our company has to 'in-house IT' and while I have some programming experience

What type of consultant should we be looking for? A database programmer?

Can an individual Freelancer handle a task like this AND provide support/modification of the front and back-end? 

Do we have to look for a larger company that specializes in this kind of thing?

What would be a guesstimate for the cost of such a database

I really appreciate any guidance on this

2) Simultaneous read/write

3) Store lots of numeric data

4) Retrieve this data fast. Selection based on time+channel.

I have heard that Teradata is a completely different animal which makes me a bit nervous that I would essentially have to start from scratch (save for my relational database and SQL concepts).  

My questions:
1) Would it be a good move in terms of career opportunities in the future?
2) Is Teradata a solid platform with a large user group such as Oracle?
3) Do you think I would be setting myself too far back by sacrificing my ~7 years of *nix experience and 3 years of RDBMS administration experience?

Will excel become too slow too fast with semi long written entries?  Would it make more sense to learn some sort of database software such as mysql or what not for this?

So here's what I've got right now...  5 related tables, I'm listing a bunch of concerts, each with a bunch of simple data, a list of bands and a total number of people who have RSVPed to attend.

shows - has an eventid

show_rsvps - has an entry with eventid and a userid for each user attending eventid

venues - has venueid

bands - has a bandid

shows_bands - has an eventid listed X times for each of X bandids  (so for event 1 with bands 1, we'd have [1,1,1],[1,2,2],3

So

Since I've grouped by eventid I have to do a new select for each eventid to get the list of bands... so I do that, but it has always worked just fine for the website I ran for years... so I've never tried to ""fix"" it.

**I don't want to look at the Operations Manual

I don't want the database to be structured around the organisation.**

While I understand that sometimes the organisation of operations data before the conceptualisation phase of the DB can lead design to be influenced by said operations data

My questions:

I had a developer attempt to add a column to the end of a table with default values that were not null. This caused the existing null columns to take up space and blew the table's size into orbit.

When I attempt to drop that column I'm greeted with ORA-600 and ORA-607 that points to corruption. Running DBV and rman block checking yielded no easy solutions as the corruption was backed up (yay!).

The only solution to this conundrum is to export the partitioned table

Let's start with the export:

&gt;exp username/password file=dumpfilename.dmp log=logfilename.log tables=tablewithcorruption

Once you've done that go ahead and login to the database as sysdba and truncate the table. Alternatively you could just login as the user that owns the table but that's no fun. Assuming you're passwordless (note that if you don't have a good FULL backup taken at this time that you should stop and slap yourself for considering the next step):

&gt;sqlplus ""/ as sysdba""

&gt;truncate table schemaname.tablename;

&gt;exit;

Now that the table has been truncated it's time to import from our dump file:

&gt;imp username/password file=dumpfilename.dmp log=logfilename.log tables=tablewithcorruption

If you get buffer errors add buffer=100000 to the import string.",self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1c0p8x/oracle_database_112_tablepartition_corruption/

The idea was to have Acts which will contain Chapters which will contain Sections which contain the actual text or pages for the book. 

At first, etc.). So getting the first act requires finding a parentid = null and position = 1. Sounds good so far but getting the first chapter in the first act would require a sub-query in which you'd get the first act's id to use as a parentid for the chapter query. However, doing that three times to get to the first section of the first chapter of the first act seems cumbersome.

I'm not entirely sure how to design my table so that it's easier to get the first section of the first chapter of the first act without having to run 3 sub-queries. I considered just having the lowest level block (section) which will list all of its parents' ids which will then correspond to a taxonomy table with further information about the Chapter or Act but idk.

I was thinking I would sort of go through the options I thought about and the pros and cons for each option.

The first idea is the simplest to implement but I think it would have *huge* speed issues later on scoring thousands of brackets. A simple table of:

tourny_id

This would store 63 rows for every bracket of every tournament and would grow very quickly. Indexing would certainly take care of alot of the headaches but it wouldn't last that long IMO. Scoring would be intensive as well as I couldn't think of any other way besides comparing the results from the master bracket row by row to each submitted bracket. I could score the brackets separately and index the results so they wouldn't have to be calculated every time

The next idea I had was storing everything as a comma separated string. If each player has a unique id the string would just be:

player_id, etc...

It would obviously have to be in a specific order. This would make retrieving the data much easier and quicker and I think it would be more efficient as well. PHP is much quicker at doing mathematical comparisons than MySQL. I could explode/split the string and then just compare it to a master array. I think this way makes the most sense to me but it seems very unconventional and since the data wouldn't be normalized it all and reports

The next idea is an offshoot of this one where you literally have a table with all the columns as matches in the tourny.

tourny_id, etc...

r = round

The benefits of retrieving and storing the data are similar as the above one and you would have the data much more accessible to SQL commands. It seems this maybe the best way but it seems so cumbersome. The draw back to this is if there is a larger tournament or a different format then I'll need new huge tables for each one. So the above option has that advantage over this one.

thanks for reading and offering up your expertise.

I work for a multifaceted media company with deals with a lot of advertising and client-specific auditing of said advertising.  I've been tasked with a project to assist with photo organizing and data collection from the field.  Our representatives in the field go out and take photos of our client locations and currently send them via email with the necessary metadata (photo location, etc) included in the body of the email.  The current workflow is messy and cumbersome.  I'd like to change this and utilize a simple database that supports rich media -- maybe something like Filemaker Pro.

I'm capturing some server stats ~160 servers

But still

  My **Big Idea**: Run a report once a minute that dumps a raw .CSV file or some other table structure to a text file on the web server and have the web page (.ASP) read that on demand vs run a SQL select statement w/ each page load.

  Is there any other way to prepare 'live-ish' reports for quick web-viewing?

    SC_TodayOverYesterday shows Aggregate data(entire farm) By 6min increments.

    Last8Days shows a compressed display taken every 30min

    Las45 Peaks shows the daily peak going back 45 days.

    The [Red  data in brackets] has been recently added 'debug' code to show the time taken for each Loop and function. 
    The time to pull the 4x SELECT statements is &lt; 1.2sec each
    The time to iterate the RS is less than a sec each also.  What confounds me is that none of these add up to anything approaching ~30 sec. yet there it is

Column 1 contains a numerical ID number.  
Column 2 is for company names. These are multi-word, etc. This is the column I need to be able to search.

I was suggested the option of going the route of newSQL and I'm liking the idea of Tokudb and mongoDB hybrid but the problem is that although mongoDB is fault tolerant mySQL would not be.  I want my RDBMS portion of my architecture to be always on as I'm planning the database to reside on a minimum of 5 different servers at once.

I should have added - I'm aware of Windows Azure SQL Fault Tolerance but keeping away from traditional SQL I'm curious what my options are.  NewSQL is ideal as the database is going to be huge potentially into the TB.

This is where I'm stuck in my planning.

In this application there will be *some* set data

My 2 options are thus - 

Option 1 - already being done by competition.  2 RDBMS to share the load between this data but 1 of the RDBMS is specifically read only for selects and the other RDBMS will be running transactions of upwards of 1 million an hour.

Option 2 - I think I would think it possible to do a RDBMS for the data that isn't changing or being called frequently and then using that to inject into a noSQL database like [foundationDB](http://www.foundationdb.com) which will allow me to maintain ACID in a noSQL instance (this is required

it's been a while since I designed a database, and now I am not sure about how to proceed when storing oriented edges connecting these nodes. I came up with two possible solutions, one is to use a single foreign key in second table identifying the starting node and a second column identifying the end-node. This way, I would have to store each path twice to be able to go both from node A to B and from B to A if I need to. The second possibility is to use both nodes A and B as foreign keys and search for the starting node in both columns so I can get all edges emerging from the current node. The edges table probably won't contain anything else except maybe an ID field as everything else needed for navigation is probably going to be computed on the fly from the node data.

I guess I am not sure which would be faster. My inclination is the second alternative to keep things simple, but I am completely unable to find it today.

I know that it is not going to affect the system that much on such a small dataset

1365994333.0,1cd6cg,First experience: Google Compute Engine,amohindr,4,2,1,"We at [NuoDB](http://www.nuodb.com) were recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. In order to access the capabilities of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.
Public cloud environments typically mean virtualization, network and disk the faster the database can operate (thank you captain obvious!). But before we dig into the numbers lets talk about what its like to run NuoDB in the GCE.
Pretty much everything you’d want to do in the GCE is done with a tool called gcutil. First you authenticate with gcutil auth, when you ssh to an instance you haven’t logged into before, a home directory is created for you automatically with your ssh credentials installed so you can then ssh from that machine into any of your other instances. In some ways GCE is easier to deal with than our private cloud (but don’t tell our sys admin I said that).
Another thing you won’t have to deal with is IP addresses
gcutil ssh image_name
It’s that easy. The gcutil command does all the things you’d expect: you can add, images, firewalls, networks and disks. For those who like to see real code here’s a snippet of our script to create a NuoDB GCE image:
gcutil addinstance --machine_type=n1-highmem-8 \
 --image=projects/google/global/images/gcel-12-04-v20130225 \
 --service_account_scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control

gcutil push nuodb-stage nuodb-1.0.1.linux.x64.deb /tmp/

gcutil ssh nuodb-stage &lt;&lt; EOF 
 sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-7-jre-headless
 sudo dpkg -i /tmp/nuodb-1.0.1.linux.x64.deb
 sudo python /usr/share/imagebundle/image_bundle.py -r / -o /tmp --output_file_name=nuodb-1.0.1.image.tar.gz
 gsutil cp /tmp/nuodb-1.0.1.image.tar.gz gs://nuodb_images/
EOF

gcutil addimage --preferred_kernel=projects/google/global/kernels/gce-v20130225 nuodb-101 gs://nuodb_images/nuodb-1.0.1.image.tar.gz
We’re working on getting a pre-built image public so that last line works for everyone. In the meantime
What this does is create an instance, it allows me to use gsutil in my instance without having to authenticate). For more details see the great gcutil docs.
After getting an image together we staged our benchmark by creating 32 images. The domain has to be formed manually by adding the following lines to instances 2-32 default.properties:
broker = false
agent = nuodb-1
We’re not supposed to talk about unimplemented features but in the future my spidey sense tells me this step will go away
From there we exploited GCE’s shared read only disk feature to get our benchmark deployed to every instance and setup 1 Storage Manager (with two disks attached for atom storage and the journal) and 32 Transaction Engines.
So without further ado we can report that NuoDB and GCE achieved 1.8 million transactions per second using our multi-client YCSB setup on workload b (5% updates) on 32 nodes. Read and update latencies were in the 1 millisecond range. We did not run the test with journaling enabled because we’re still working on getting high IO performance against a GCE virtual disk, db size, etc), so we can run more benchmarks covering the right use-cases.
These results demonstrate clearly that NuoDB and GCE work very well together and we’re excited about adding further support for GCE in future releases.

Now here is my situation / problem / question. I have never programmed or setup a database in my life. In addition I am someone who best understands things if it shown to me or explained in a step-by-step fashion. That is why reading FAQs and such on this topic has not really helped me.

I am listening to a weekly radio mix show and the track lists for each show are available online. Now these lists are in a simple HTML table. Which means there is no possibility to search through them

I would like to setup a simple website that allows people to search through these track lists. It is clear to me that I would need to have a database that contains the necessary information such as artists

- Artist
- Song title
- (Possible remix)
- Show date
- DJ who mixes the particular show

Now what is the structure that one should use to make this well searchable? One database or many? One huge table or many smaller ones? What information should be in what table and how should they be connected?

Basically: How the hell should this be structured and where should I begin. I am grateful for any help or simplified explanation that can give me a start.

**Edit**

I made an example of the track list of one show. I left out the ""Remix"" segment.

In a double entry accounting system, and it is well short of possible in a normalized setup.

In relational algebra we could define relation L for line items such that:

journal_entry_idGsum(amount) = 0

Additionally

So the approach I am looking at taking is to start from a normalized journal_entry and journal_line table and then attach an array of journal_line items to journal_entry.  I can then model the running total as a ""table method"" and then break out the data using a trigger.  In this way data would be entered into the journal_entry table, so this has the nice side effect of also checking the column constraints properly too.

So I see the obvious costs:  creating the appropriate insert statement is programatically harder and altering the journal_line table is going to be harder in PostgreSQL.  However

So my question is:

A massive amount of the data is in a standardized format

If I were to guess, so there's a rough common format across them all.

I'd like to call upon oDesk (or similar) to hire a database developer that will create a system where I can just dump the files in and then have some sort of search and analyze capability. I envision something where I can put in my desired criteria and the database spits out documents and aggregated information matching my interest.

For example: I want to find out how many companies my dad worked with in Los Angeles
The data's there... it's just in thousands of PDFs! Certainly it's possible to do this sort of thing. Right?
So... I have no clue what database setup I'm looking for

Question 1: Any thoughts as to what database format I should target (SQL, etc.)

Question 2: Is it even possible for me to have a database search and aggregate information that's locked in scanned PDF files? If so

Question 3: can I run the data and search through a website so I'm not tied down to any one computer?

Question 4: The data's on CDs... do I need to buy my own servers for the database framework and the data? Or

Help me

I'm in full-on job-hunting mode and am finding that, at least without the by-hand tracking I'm doing becoming a huge time-suck in itself.

I did a little searching

More specifically, but otherwise doesn't have a good at-a-glance dashboard showing the status of applications. Applymate has just such a dashboard - listing out the applications entries I've made and allowing for sorts by ""in process"", ""completed"", ""awaiting interview"", or ""rejected"" and the like - but it otherwise lacks any tagging feature. Neither site, sadly, allows the uploading of documents in order to attach to any particular entry - something I absolutely need because I tailor my resume and cover letter, for each job I apply for.

Do you guys know of any available site or database application that either already provides for what I am looking for

A big thanks in advance for any insight

tl;dr: applying for jobs and want a database to track the applications as well as archive the documents submitted for each. Applymate.com and Gigcart.com are nice attempts

Now the the database is in fact a file. And I'm thinking if its possible to treat it so and try to save so much data as possible.

I guessing when the db is opened by a tool or program it first check its headers.
In my case I get the error message right away. I'm assuming that the headers are corrupt

In the documents http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html there are explanations for the header offsets.
