I have permission from the theater company to do anything to get in: hit it with a hammer (tried, doesn't work), scream in frustration (tried, doesn't work). As long as the theater itself is protected, any tactics and techniques are on the table. Alas, in my zeal to use an angle grinder, the combination dial was totally destroyed

It's also probably impossible to move the safe out of the theater... There's no elevator

Any thoughts or advice? If you're in Chicago and actually want to come try your hand, pirate's treasure, thousands of dollars, mountains of cocaine. Or it could be totally empty.

[this is the current thread over at /r/whatsinthisthing](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1glu3r/as_promisedupdate_the_hero_that_rwhatsinthisthing/)

[And this is the thread that generated the interest](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ggb8b/the_hero_that_rwhatsinthisthing_needs/)

I do apologize to the mods if this broke any rules

Again, Eastern Standard Time (US). I will be assisting Mr. Watters in answering questions. I'll post the thread around 4:30pm to generate questions for the 5:00pm start time. 

Thank you!

I have a few and would hear of yours.

**Padlock**
My first place of work was a business that sold powered equipment. Myself and my co-workers were all junior sales people
We were on commission, because, as I said - we were all junior and not well paid).
A mate working there had sewn up a deal on a machine
All the display models were chained together with a padlock to prevent theft.
No problem
Now where's the key?
Who has the key?
Anybody?
Bueller?

Key can not be found. Customer is ready to go buy one somewhere else
I come in to check what's going on, lockpicking saved the day. Customer takes machine away, workmate does the deal and gets his commission.

**Daihatsu Charade**
It is 10pm on a Wednesday night

""Uh hi

""I am

""I'm around the corner and I've kinda locked my keys in the car.""

""I can drive you home to get the spare set

""There is no spare set.""

""OK well have you called a locksmith?""

""He charges $180 to come out now.""

""Well why not wait until tomorrow?""

""I've locked the keys in the car with the engine running in my friend's driveway. People are trying to sleep

""OK
Got there
Wedging the door open and try to get coathangers etc in. We managed to turn the ignition OFF with a coat-hanger
I admit defeat

""Yeah!""

Bust out the auto tensioner

... and do you think he made good with a 6-pack of beer? Fucking nope.

**The rental property**
Moved house long distance last year
We arrived late in the afternoon
Ring the real estate agent:
""Oh

Wife says do it.

I say ""Stuff this. I'll pick it. I'm not sleeping on cardboard or paying for a hotel.""

2 mins later
Real estate rings back

""Hi

""Don't worry about it. We took the lock off.""

""Ummm... how?""

I'd say your best bet would be to get a hold of two videos: **Lockpicking for the New Mellenium** and **A Visual Guide to Lockpicking**. After watching these two videos I was immediately hooked. I found them on /r/baconbits, but it can be a bit tough conceptually if you aren't yet all that familiar with lock internals.

When buying supplies

The most important items, and then you have a problem on your hands, especially if it failed in the locked position. My best suggestion would be to hit up places like Goodwill or eBay as they often have used ones that work perfectly. Remember, you don't need a brand new shiny lock. You don't even need a key. Just be sure that you're *getting a lock that matches your level of skill*. Getting something too tough will just de-motivate you. Also, if you're willing to pay the money, you can buy a set of practice locks on eBay. They come in a set of 5 and are pinned from 1 pins up to 6 pins, which allows you to work your way up in an incremental fashion. What I did was I bought a set of five 5-pin locks and just took pins out of them to make my own practice set, but at the cost of having to prepare it.

Practice daily. Learn to feel the internals as best as you can. It will take a while but rest assured it will pay off. 

Your next best bet is to start interacting with the online community, but harder to navigate. 

There's [/r/lockpicking](http://lockpicking.reddit.com/) and [/r/locksport](http://locksport.reddit.com) here on reddit, but we'll see what the future holds.

I've been doing my research here and on Wikipedia and other lockpicking forums, which is nice when you consider that shipping will add. The SouthOrd is cheaper and has an instruction book, but it only has one tension wrench, and I've gathered that more of those is usually better. The Sparrows set has several tension wrenches but loses the ball pick to add a second type of rake. I know that if I stick with the hobby I'll probably want to expand my pick set eventually but at the moment I'm just looking for something to cover the basics that isn't missing anything crucial.

He proceeds to show me how to pick the lock for the paper towel dispenser explaining what hes doing then has me try. Somehow I am able to get it after a few tries. Was pretty much the best feeling in the world. We parted ways and I then proceeded to try and pick every single lock I could get my hands on. 

I still use that set to this day and has come in handy more times then I can think of as my friends always seem to be calling me with lockout jobs now.

Lesson is over, I took the wrong keys!
I phoned my dad
No one was home at that time
My dad said he was out for grocery shopping and that he'd be back in a while.
""To hell with waiting in the cold"" I thought to myself ""I'll pick the damn thing"".
And I did, I'm a noob and I'm happy.

I think I've proven to myself and hopefully others that lockpicking is a skill worth your time and lockpicks are a nice thing to have with you.

Here is a [pic of it](http://i.imgur.com/OWRCMiG.jpg). What is different than the original is that I found out that because the diameter of the copper tube was small... that the spring and T-ish handle has to be twisted completely 360 degrees for it to be forceful enough to turn the plug once tripped. ANd only one cut notch (on the pipe) was needed (instead of two). The T-handle had to be made so that one side was lower than the other so that only that side would fit into the single notch. I hope I have explained it adequately enough.

[Here is a pic of it disassembled](http://i.imgur.com/hN7gv8j.jpg) 

There was still a problem with the copper tube being too soft and the notch becoming worn down after use and the t-handle not staying in place once set. To fix this I took an old golf club that had a metal shaft

Now I read a bit around here and other forums and a thing that always comes up is NOT TOO MUCH TENSION, I can only bring up one pin; I'm not able to push another one up.

I'm trying on a Master No.140 that's a bit used, I was wondering if I should get a brand new lock (I read that Masters No.3 or No.5 are good starting locks) or if I'm just doing something wrong.

Sometimes I have to do evictions with the sheriff.

No big deal Ill just go get my pick set... I had left it in my personal truck which was at the office about two hours away. So I found a small screw driver and bent a key ring, it only took me about a minute to pick it. Needless to say I was happy and my two coworkers were impressed.

1. Petersons is the way to go for quality (though pricey)
2. It's best to buy single pics
3. Concensus seems to be to get a couple of hooks, and PPB regular + lite.


My order is therefore as follows: [[Order Form Screenshot]](http://i.imgur.com/OSvHd.png)

Hooks:

- Hook 1 - Plastic Gov Steel
- Hook 1 DCAP - Gov Steel
- Lifter 1 DCAP - Gov Steel
- Peterson Reach - Plastic Gov Steel

Rakes:

- Long Ripple - Plastic Gov Steel
- Double Rake - Plastic Gov Steel

Diamond:

- Diamond: DCAP - Gov Steel

The reason I went for the DCAP Diamond, with the fewest but right tools to do the job.

My primary goals are padlocks to begin with, with a slim profile that can fit smaller locks.

I decided to finally give it a try after reading the CIA Expedient Key Casting Manual. Basic concept, removing it, then using lead to cast a key to use as the template to cut a regular key. 

The setup is simple enough, and lead. 

As usual bubbles are hassle but I've found that if you pour with the mold at an angle with the cut side of the key imprint down that helps out quite a bit by filling up the lowest parts and making it easy for the air to escape.

The regular casting materials worked okay, and takes many hours to cure. Cost is low, relatively easy to mix ratios.

I've never used JB weld for anything before so I thought I'd give that a shot. Took a long time to cure and was super brittle

The lead worked alright

I'm trying to find something that doesn't require heat to melt the material (like lead), AND that isn't too expensive / complex to work with.

How much tension should i be putting? I generally put enough tension so that the tension wrench barely doesn't start bending is that too much?

My technique is generally just use a rake to get as many pins as i can then push down any pins that i can see and then even when i take a flashlight and look for pins i cant seem to find any. sometimes when using the rake i  unlock the padlock other times I don't and can't seem to find the last pin.

I have encountered a diabolical lock and I looked like a little bitch in front of my employer.,DicaeopolisAnthropos,23,10,21,"So I am a amateur at best but I can pick with general ease on most regular locks. Well there has been a ton of petty theft at a factory I am employed at and the needed me to help open lockers as they have been around for so long that the master key is lost for 20 plus years. Oh Im not a suspect obviously because I have access to much better petty theft. Mostly tools or things left around the factory floor

It is an ASE lock made in Aurora

The biggest problem is I do not know what the key looks like as they are passed worker to worker. *Not a racially charged statement* 99% of the workers are Asian and outright refuse to cooperate in anyway when I ask them anything. I maintain and diminish fire danger by controlling the lint levels in the factory (100, and towels a week equals about 200 lbs of lint in formations you would not believe let that build one week and then it is 400 lbs let that continue and you get what happened in Bangladesh. God be with those people, that is my nightmare.) Because all they see me doing while they are there is spraying my air gun and occasionally the odd lint explosions hits worker passing by. They don't see what happens when they leave and I go inside of machines bigger than my apartment. They are the ones with the keys and all I got when asking to look at one of the keys was a very tiresome I don't speak English act.

So any suggestions? I have a titanium Southford with a decent variety of rakes and a good broken key extractor but I have no idea how I can even effectively use a pick set on such a bastard lock. I am too new to sort through internet bravado and falsehoods a google search would provide btw. I will get some pics up in a few hours as my wife is sleeping and my camera phone is crap.

I moved into a house recently that has a pretty sweet man-cave. The previous owner worked as a maintenance engineer for a local college, he didn't have any keys. :(

**My Question:**

Has anyone seen a lock like this? It would be awesome if I could find a key that will work for this door. Any information would be helpful!

**Here's what I know:**

* The lock seems to accept some sort of angled skeleton key.

* There don't appear to be any manufacturer's markings. However

* The door came from an old US hospital in either Massachusetts or New Hampshire... possibly one with a mental ward (so I was told... the owner could have been stretching the truth
* The door itself is about 2"" thick solid wood

Again, manufacturer of the lock, etc. etc. etc.

There is a allen-head inset bolt/screw on the black ring on the shaft. Well... seems when the thing was made/assembled... either the picks were to short or the hole drilled on the shaft (not the black ring) that the inset screw's tip fits into wasnt positioned far enough down the shaft. Either way.... the sliding picks never exactly reached far enough to the tip of the shaft. (from online videos they say that the picks should stick out a tad farther from the shaft ... mine didnt)

So what I did a few minutes ago was I unscrewed the inset bolt/screw &amp; pushed the black ring down farther on the shaft so that the bolt/screw missed the drilled hole it is supposed to fit into on the shaft. Instead... the bolt/screw connects with the surface of the shaft. This made the picks stick out considerably more at the end. And of course... you push them back to make them flush with the end before you use the tool on the lock. 

[image](http://i.imgur.com/ViORG.jpg)

Its surprisingly easy how well it works now on the simple tubular lock I have been playing with.



Note: also... i found the push button spring feature in the handle VERY annoying

I managed to get a key stuck in a lock. I've been told that the lock is a 'double bitted lever lock'. I haven't been able to Google an image that looks exactly like the key

What happened was that I wanted to lock the front door gate last night, thinking I could just align it now and then fully lock the lock, however the lock popped back to its completely unlocked state with the key still being turned 180 degrees.

The lock is made so that the key can only be inserted the right way around. In other words

So

[3](http://i.imgur.com/czzVt.jpg)

Thanks in advance :)

Edit: I got a bit impatient and tried some light force with the key. To my surprise, so I had to stick a screwdriver into the lock where the bent part of the key was, and use another tool to be able to force turn the key a bit. Got the key straightened out so I could get it out of the lock. The key still works for locking and unlocking the lock, but when the gate is closed, I have to jiggle the gate a bit and apply some mild force to get it to fully lock. I guess that's because of the key damage.

1376594784.0,1kfrua,I just got my Titanium bogota picks (regular size) .,dirtymoney,15,4,5,"Just got the Bogota Picks. The Titanium regular sized ones. 

This is going to take some getting used to. They are so small and hard to hold on to. They dont glide in many locks like most people have said. I have noticed that you have to use extremely light tension on them. I can use my ""pogoda"" knockoff pick (that has the full handle) better than I can use the bogotas.  I also had to rip apart several different pens until I found a spring that was the right size for them. Most springs seemed a little too small (in diameter) to fit well on the picks' shafts. Just right enough to slide on the handles and to tighten up just a tad as it slid up to the twists on the picks' shafts. 

I may have to stipple or roughen up the handles just a bit so i can get a decent grip on them. Or... i may bend them in more of a right angle like the compact version. 

On master lock #3 padlocks... i can use the single wave pick easier than the three wave one to open the lock. It slides back and forth in the lock much easier than the three wave pick. On 5-pin or more locks I just cant open any of them yet (I can somewhat easily with the pogoda pick). Well

Maybe my technique is wrong with these specific picks. It has only been a few days so I am sure I need to practice a helluva lot more with these before I become proficient with them.

edit: For raking...I think i have been holding them wrong. I think the correct way is to put the thumb on the lower bent part section and the side of the index finger at the bend of the pick and then push down with your thumb so that it levers upwards and puts upward pressure on pins.

Out for Christmas dinner with the family, so I pulled out a paperclip and my leatherman Wave (the old one, this one's going on 12 years now).  while i was attempting to pick the lock, my mom was rummaging through her car looking for a spare key.  after 5 minutes or so, she showed up with a key, leaving me unsuccessful.  

I knew she had a drawer of locks she uses on her storage units, and after a good 20 minutes or so, I had successfully picked it with my crappy paperclip and leatherman.  Terrible tools, but it worked.  I have been unable however, to re-pick it.  I don't know what it's got inside, and I know nothing about locks really other than the couple videos youtube has shown me. 

If anybody knows more about the security features of these locks, but most seem to say southord are good.  Any in particular?  Link please so I can decide which ones to buy.  

EDIT: http://www.chinrose.com/Disc%20Locks.htm  I guess it's the D70X

EDIT 2: After reading about these ""mushroom pins"" I think i'll be able to re-pick it

EDIT 3: the D70X has become childsplay.  a couple mushroom tumblers, for the life of me, get to open.

  It seems the only way I can even get some pins to set is by raking with no-to moderate tension.  Once in a while I can get one pin to set with my paperclip pick.

2. **How many picks?**  The baseline sets at [Lockpick Shop] (http://www.lockpickshop.com) are all about 5 pcs.  For that you can get the normal hook, and rake.  But I've also heard a lot about the [PSX-14](http://www.lockpickshop.com/PXS-14.html) set which is a 14-piece set for only $6 more.

So far I have three distinct number where they ALWAYS make a very faint metal-on-metal ""tink"" sound. Actually its not just a single number... its maybe a small range of numbers .... like 91,39,40....9,10,11. Well, it IS a single number within each three, I just dont know which one it is definitively.  They can always be heard when turning the dial left

Keep in mind... i can only hear these when I  have my ear against the safe door (right next to the combo dial) while turning the dial... and in a very quiet room. And like I said earlier ... after the discs have all connected and are dragging each other around. So it is not the discs making contact with each other. It is something else. What exactly is it?  

I have an idea of what I am hearing

Note: I know how the inner workings of a combo safe works. The gates, but it took me forever back then because I knew nothing about it. Note: this one had four discs instead of the typical three.

edit: what I would LOVE to see is a video of the front and back of the lock as a professional safecracker cracks a safe

About the safe: it must be at least 60 years old (if not older), had been repainted over &amp; over so it doesnt have any graphics on it... no manufacturer's marks and no possibility of the combo scribbled on it somewhere (I have checked).

1321642134.0,mh6xc,Several beginner questions about lockpicking technique.,razorangel,6,0,1,"I started a few weeks ago and have been practicing daily

But I'm still struggling with two things and I was hoping I might get some pointers from you guys.


**Problem 1)** Raking. I understand it conceptually. I've seen videos. But even on the easiest locks I've never been able to just rake open the lock using ***JUST raking.***  Even when I feel I did it well I have to go in with a medium hook and finish it off. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Are the youtube videos misleading and open a no-security-pin lock not a common thing? As far as I understand it you put the rake in all the way back, applying ever-more pressure upward? Doesn't this result in over-set pins? Can anyone link to a GOOD video demonstrating technique? I've already waded through too many videos of people showing off their skills but providing not instruction.

**Problem 2)** Masterlock #3. Bear with me. Everyone seems to agree that they're really easy -- and they are. I can usually jiggle a half diamond pick from back to front and get it open. But it infuriates me that I can't single-pick it open with a medium hook! All the pins seem to be so mushy and the cylinder itself has so much play that I can *never* tell when a pin gets set! This is one case where I hope I'm missing something and one of you gents has some advice. The keyway seems rather short. Should I be using a slim/euro pick? I have the Southord 22 piece kit and it doesn't have any thin-shifted picks.

Making me wonder if they have security pins. Note: I have several herculock 800s that I have gotten open... some were easy

Questions: 

**how can you tell which way a lock is supposed to turn to open?** From what I have found... herculocks can turn one specific way to open. Some turn counterclockwise

**What is happening when I push a single pin up til it binds and then I release tension.... and I hear two clicks as the pin falls?** Shouldnt it be one click? Is that the work of a security pin? This happens on one of my 700s. The front pin does this. 

Edit made an hour after originally posted: I just SPP'ed the one with the front pin (I mentioned in the second question) opened. I wish I knew what I did right. also... it turns clockwise like I thought (different from the 800 herculocks).
