I often get a lot of flack for spending unusual amounts of time considering the new technologies that are emerging in cinematography/imaging.  I always go back to a quote from Wayne Gretzky:  ""I skate to where the puck is going to be

The following are technologies that have come to my attention over the past two years that equally excite

Depth Capture:

Regardless of how you feel about Avatar's (or even Beowulf's) visual styles

That said
  
You think you got burned when you shot everything in RAW and the producers/director went in and completely changed the entire look of the film after you spent weeks of coloring it?  That was only the tip of the iceberg.  The only solution going forward seems to be to lock in your level of control in the contract negotiation phase

Nonetheless

Luddites

- changing camera angle: if the depth is captured alongside a stream of cameras that capture color and luminosty and are arranged orthoginally

- lighting: depth/color/luminosity can be a deadly combination for relighting.  Currently

- focus: If the computer knows what depth everything is at
OR this tech could actually allow us to more accurately stay in focus on absolutely mammoth sensors.  Software could be developed to more faithfully follow points in space if there's a depth stream that is already being captured...(super Easy Focus/mutant panatape).

- atmospheric effects: point clouds are the secret ingedient for this kind of immersive CG as well.  The endless hours spent pulling depth from flat images would be gone.

- keying: if the software already knows where the edges are
I understand that this is directly proportional to the resolution of the captured point cloud

- lens distortion:  You woud be able to add it or subtract it.  Perhaps this may bring about a style where you could shoot high resolution on a fisheye and compensate in post for the spacial/barrel distortion inherent to such optics.  You could get all of your coverage from one lens and take... which leads me to the next technology that I see on the horizon:

Vector Imaging:

This is a potentially world-shattering technological advance that was recently achieved by students at Bath University.

http://opus.bath.ac.uk/32970/

Some excerpts from ""CONSTRUCTING AND RENDERING VECTORISED PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES"" 

""Vector formats
In this paper we show how to resolve this problem. As the contours can be thought of as a model of the image they need to be converted to a sampled image format in order to be seen on raster display devices. Thus a rendering process, if flat-fill is insufficient, how do we determine the intermediate pixel values between contours when rendering back to the sampled form? 
(...)
A major problem in determining this vector form is that of determining how many contours to use. A na ̈ıve approach would be to use one contour for ev­ery unit of colour quantisation but this not only pro­duces far more contours than are needed for a visually faithful reproduction of the image but also far more detail in defining each contour than is needed. If flat fill is used within contour boundaries the inefficient na ̈ıve approach is the only technique which will as­ sure an artefact-free result. Techniques based on mor­phological principles (e.g. [Ser82]) do this and, notably in terms of the number of levels required for a visually satisfactory rendering. In such an approach all that would be needed for a visually faithful rendering would be to fill the contour with an ‘average’ colour quantised to be the border colour. In fact far fewer contours are needed in practice as we will show here.
(...)
To illustrate the con­tours without too much visual confusion we chose the out-of-focus image (...) ""

As the paper illustrates

Furthermore, the fields are captured simultaneously by neighboring pixels on the same sensor.  The focusing is left to algorithms in post, which selectively skip certain pixels in order to show a specific field.  

High Frame Rate: 

I have to say, it felt like a re-enactment on the history channel rather than a cinematic experience.  Their implementation of 3D hurt my brain/eyes in HFR.  I used to be a vocal proponent of Maxivision 35, but having seen this, I was horrified.  I know I am not alone in this opinion.
I do, it won't feel so odd.  Why did it seem like the Red Epic had FAR less dynamic range than I have sene in my own shooting experience?  There were parts of the movie where it worked.  The scene with Gollum in his cave lair seemed to work well.  But, the opening shots of Bilbo in his house looked clipped and strange.  Tight shots looked overcranked and jump cuts became GLARING.

Biomimicry eventually wins out... I just can't imagine how after seeing that.  Perhaps we'll revisit this someday when virtual reality becomes the norm for movies.  Will that ever happen? You tell me.
________________

Since the benefits are debatable

Concave Sensors:

My visions of cinema's future often rely heavily on an ever more apparent reliance on biomimicry (a popular device in modern engineering).  A healthy does of biomimicry informs the question
I think

I admit, backside-illuminated sensor technology, and on-sensor micro-lensing, which take a more backwards-compatible approach to solving this problem.

Why not solve this problem by killing two (or many) birds with one stone instead?  Why not (instead of making the back element of a lens optimized for a flat sensor) tailor it toward a curved one?  If I'm not mistaken (optics experts feel free to chime in here) the back element of a lens has to do much (or all) of the compensation for a square imager.  If we could compare a lens designed for a flat imager with the exact same lens designed for a concave imager, I am by no means an expert and I post this mostly to hear my thoughts challenged.

I believe that, introducing far less distortion and falloff.  I understand that such a sensor would be a bold move and it would have the unfortunate side effect of leaving behind hundreds of years of lenses.  But, would we gain more than we lost?  You tell me.  I've never heard anyone talk about this.  I come to this idea from the observation that wide angle lenses look absolutely stunning when they are used on a short flange focal depth, full frame camera system such as the Leica M series.  This observation (as many have told me) probably just stems from good optical deisgn on Leica's part and it is actually HARDER to get wide angle lenses to behave properly when the back element is so close to the image plane.  How else can you explain the huge FFD of Panavision and even PL lenses (which look absolutely stunning at all sizes)?

I talked at some length with Matt Duclos about this recently and he says (which many/most optics experts agree with) that a shorter flange focal depth makes optical design harder and introduces many problems since the back element needs to do more unsqueezing to get to the edges of the sensor.

Still


Final thoughts:
I know it's sort of unhealthy to obsess over emerging technologies.  But, Mauro Fiore on Avatar, and Claudio Miranda on Life of Pi) don't intend to watch myself become irrelevant.  With the spirit of versatility in my heart, I try to embrace new ideas and look at them as tools in an ever-expanding arsenal designed solely to help a director create his/her vision.  After all, we can always decide not to use those tools just as easily as we can decide TO use them.  It's all a matter of what the project/shot calls for, in my opinion.
 
Are there any that I've forgotten that you're seeing?  Global sensor technology seems to be one that we desperately need but I can't imagine how it will be perfected as it is in film/Aaton's new camera.

I come from a video background, but I'm working on learning filmic methods including the zone system.

I've only begun exploring it (and my copy of ""The Negative"" is still in the mail)

So my question is how do you adapt the system when working with cameras with reduced dynamic ranges? 

Do you always use zone 5 for neutral grey, zone 7 (+2 stops) for the brightest object with full detail, and just chop off the top and bottom of the scale? Accepting that you will have less detail in the highlights and shadows?

Or do you adjust the number of stops between zones, and bright objects in zone 7 become (+1 1/2 stops). 

In the second example, but 2/3 stops or 1/2.

Or do you use another method I haven't mentioned?

Recently I've become really fascinated with cinematography.  It started earlier in September, but I didn't know anything about his thoughts.  He was the smartest person I know that's my age, and all he threw at me was ""A camera-man"".  

I said something a long the lines of ""that's cool"".  Here my friend was, and decided to try and watch the two movies through the eyes of ""The Camera-Man"".  I noticed things about movies I never payed attention to: Line delivery, facial expression, angles, lighting, sound quality, everything.  It was incredibly satisfying.  

After watching those two movies again at the beginning of October

So here I am, and the only photography I've done is for family vacations.  I'm asking for all the direction I can get.  What kind of camera should I be looking at?  Editing software?  *What do i even take videos of?*

The film is an odd love story about disconnected people coming together; a hypersensitive girl and a man who is losing the ability to feel any emotion due to a brain disorder. It has some things in common with Upstream Color

This will be a small shoot. The cast is limited, and in apartments. There are no large set pieces, I don't require any ridiculously complicated dolly shots, but experience with a steadicam or DIY cranes would be wonderful.

What we have: a Sony VG-30 with [this lens](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/913563-REG/sony_selp_18200_18_200mm_f_3_5_6_3_pz_oss.html).

It is a pretty good lens but we want bigger apertures(don't we all?). We have no lighting gear so having bigger apertures always helps.

We decided on buying the Rokinon Cine lenses, and my budget is going to go straight into buying a Sony NEX-7n as a B cam.

His budget is going to be around 2k dollars.

We also decided to buy our camera gear Sony all the way, etc. This if we don't have to rent gear, of course.

We're trying to get the most out of this trip

So we were thinking in getting the **14mm, specially because of the distortion, that I need to say bugs the hell out of me.

Reminding you all that the camera is an APS-C camera so all of these *1.6 . The 8mm covers APS-C only so it vignettes on a full frame.

We are starting doing work mainly on ye' old regular stuff: corporate, music videos, etc.

The rest of the money is going to be spent on stuff like audio(probably a Senheiser ntg-2, SD card cases, etc.

What do you think? Should we replace the 14mm with the 8mm? Or with the 24mm?

It's so much to decide as to not waste money my head is going to explode.

I've really appreciated a lot of the expertise I've found on this sub and thought I'd fish for some knowledge.

I'd consider myself to be a savvy photographer with a pretty good understanding of lighting (studio and event), but I have no running lights.

I'm being trusted to light and shoot a wide array of shorts for my production company. My buddy has a kit of x3 1000W Arri's (and a few sloppy filters, but that's all up at our studio 6 hours away. I'm looking to get my own lighting set-up for shooting both independently and in conjunction with his set-up.

The applications would be for (at most) a large studio space (approx. 2250 sq ft) down to just small room size.

What would you guys recommend to get started? Is a x3 Arri kit the way to go? It's what I'm most familiar with from random occasional shoots and my time in film school shooting 16mm

The Fs700 just strikes me so much as digital sony looking. Maybe I'm being way too picky for my situation and should just deal with it

The Red One-MX is a great camera. It's also a gigantic tank of a camera, but having only shot on the new REDs, I've read that slow motion shooting can be persnickety and one needs to really delve into the menu's to get it going correctly. 

So what do you guys think? The c300 can't do high frame rates (REALLY CANON?) but otherwise that's a nice image. Anything I'm overlooking? Older cams? I'd love to her what the community is thinking. Thanks so much for your input!

First

I've tried researching this on Google but to no real avail. With the new Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera that I saw last week at NAB, how, if at all, could I get this setup to work? I know when filming with the Alexa and 2x anamorphic lenses, you need the 4:3 sensor option. I'm struggling to translate this to S16mm (or is it exactly the same principles). Would I need to ""frame"" to a 4:3 aspect ratio (since I can't switch the sensor - it's permanently natively 16:9) and then crop and lose the resolution in post?

I'm an indie director who occasionally does a project, and we already rented equipment and had the space to ourselves, so we couldn't reschedule.

So I had to operate the camera (something I'm not that comfortable doing). I filmed with a Panny HVX-200

Check out the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnQBpYiMr2s

The whole thing came out a little grainy looking, some of the shots just don't look anything like what I saw in the viewfinder. Some of the movement looks choppy, and altogether I don't feel like the quality is very good.

What do you guys think? Do you think it was the camera? Could this have been fixed in post? Did I miss any major lighting?

The ""jello"" distortion and the only fps available at 1080p being 24 was annoying and didnt give me much to work with. The D3100 has 2 lenses

So I saved my money and just bought a brand new Canon EOS Rebel T3i/600D with the 18-55mm kit lens. Everyone was telling me that the video quality was amazing and that Canon's were so much better than Nikons for video. I was sold on the 60fps and flip out screen so I found a great deal and bought it. When I got the camera, maybe im crazy, but it seems to me like the D3100's video quality is better than the Canon's. For starters, the T3i does not have Continuous AF, which is most likely THE most feature for a video camera. The colors on the T3i seem bland and desaturated while the D3100's colors are bright and vivid. I'm always amazed when I look at the footage I get from the D3100. 

So needless to say

**TL;DR: Bought a T3i after using a D3100 for a while. Disappointed with T3i video quality. Don't know if I should trade it in for a D3200 body or not.**

Here are my Priorities and Dilemma's:

1) I already own two Nikon lenses: an 18-55mm and a 55-200mm

2) The D3200 has 6 more MP (18 vs 24) and would be cheaper to buy.

3)The quality of the D3100's video seems better than the T3i

4) The Nikon's Nikkor 18-55mm has a MUCH wider angle than the T3i's 18-55mm and it looks magnificent.

5) I feel there may be a few things in both camera's that I dont fully understand

6) The T3i lacks Continuous AF which is a MUST for the type of filming I do

Maybe its because I havent shot the T3i in sunlight? I dont know

EDIT: The T3i video quality is EXTREMELY noisey/grainy. I just took a test video between both cameras both at the same settings: Shutter speed 100,,False,self,t5_2ri38,1348731247.0,,True

They both have a hard-lit look

In my opinion, which leads me to notice all the absurd moments much more in the *content*.

But furthermore, or whether the films are just poorly executed. For example, take a look at [this shot from the *Safety Not Guaranteed* trailer](http://i.imgur.com/oImbe.jpg). The lighting just seems badly thought out. There's little contrast to the image, instead of softening the lights to make the scene look natural, they just seem to be decreasing the intensity, and the whole thing just seems sidelit for the sake of being sidelit.

I'm not being as clear as I like in this post because my position is one of a lack of clarity. All in all: who else is noticing this in some modern films?",self,t5_2ri38,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/zvp6m/a_new_video_look_to_certain_recent_films/
