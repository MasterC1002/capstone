I think it would be good if we could get some comprehensive guides that we could compile into this post

It seems like a lot of people are willing to purchase a Gopro

I use an Adobe workflow, FCP, and others.  **Also feel free to suggest improvements to workflows as well as video's that have helped you learn more such as tutorials on slow motion, color correcting etc.**  I will make sure to give credit, when credit is deserved.



So I will start:



Description:

* I primarily film snowboarding, wakeskating, and occasionally skateboarding.  So the Gopro makes a great action camera for me, and allows me to get close in on the action.

* I use Adobe CS6, Encore, Soundbooth, Audition, Speedgrade, and occasionally Photoshop.  I also use Gopro's free Cineform software.  Lastly, I use a few plugins for some of the programs.  In after effects I use the following programs: Twixtor, Magic Bullet Looks


* I originally had a Gopro Hero for my filming and I often filmed at 720p 60fps.  However it is important to note, and not enough light is getting to the camera, then your clips will look dark, and it will be harder to correct in post.





Now for the workflow:

/u/xdamanx's Workflow With Adobe CS6 and Gopro Cineform
-------

-----

Part 1 - Gopro Cineform
-----

1.  I start by shooting my footage, I do.  This allows the weight of the camera to help stabilize the camera.  

2. I try and use high quality SD cards, it will be very important to have at least a Class 10 card.  I recommend looking on amazon for them as their prices tend to be fairly reasonable.

3.  After shooting my footage


 I like to put my footage into a folder system that allows me to easily understand how things work.  I start by creating a top level folder called something such as ""Gopro"" or ""Media"".  Inside of that I like to put the year, ""Transcoded"", and ""Output"".


4. After I have put my footage in the RAW folder, and begin to start to sort out my cuts.  I start by going into the ""Advanced Settings"" box, and changing a few settings:

* I usually leave the frame size at the original setting

* I change the frame rate to 23.976

* I leave the ""Speed Up"" box blank.

* I set the file format to ""MOV"", but after conducting a few quality tests I have found that the MOV format works a little better for uploads to websites such as Youtube and Vimeo, whereas AVI tends to be better for DVD's and other physical media.

* For the quality box, however medium will be more then fine for most of you.  It really depends on how capable your computer is of editing the file, as well as the hard drive space you have.

* I tick the ""remember settings"" box so that it saves my settings for all of my clips.

After hitting ok

* I can hit the Rotate/Flip box if I need to flip my clip.  (The gopro has an upside down mode

* I change the ""save to"" directory to wherever its applicable.  This is usually an external hard drive.  This time though I put it into a ""transcodes"" folder in the same level as the RAW folder.  (So it looks like: D:\Gopro\2012\Project_Name\Transcodes)

* I change the file name

* I then click the ""Add Clip To Conversion List"" box.  When I have done this to all of my clips, or do something else while my computer transcodes my footage.  When its finished, this portion is complete.  I don't use the ""Edit"" function of the Cineform application as I use Premiere Pro for that.


Premiere CS6
-----



With any video editing program, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.  Find out what each tool does, and how effects work, and become familiar with the program.  This is the basis of becoming better at content creation.  When you edit videos, its a personal task, you are in charge of making the cuts, coloring the video


Now this part of the guide is going to assume you have a basic understanding of how to navigate around in the program


So lets begin:


* When you installed the Gopro Cineform application, with 2 tabs.  The first tab is where you can set the project file name, as well as where to save the project.  The second tab is also important.  This is the scratch disks, if you have an external hard drive with available space, consider using this as your scratch disk to improve your performance.

* After creating the project, tabs in green will remain the same for all of your gopro footage, and tabs in orange will vary based on your resolution, and destination frame rate.  Also make sure you save your preset for future use. After this, give your sequence a name and then press ok.

* After this point, perhaps at one point I will expand this part of the guide.  For this part I highly recommend you watch some Youtube videos for more information.

This is going to change soon. 

Starting with the for sale thread. I have registered [r/GoProMarket](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoProMarket/). This is where you can post all your gear for sale or any deals you find. This will keep /r/GoPro clear of for sale style posts.

The next rule won't go into effect right away. Basically we want to cut down on the same type of questions. What SD card should I get? What is a good microphone? What GoPro should I get? These type of posts will be cut down thanks to a FAQ page. The FAQ page is in the works and will be going live on 11/17. It will be constantly worked on


What I don't want to happen is turn this subreddit into a heavily moderated one. That's what the voting system is for and the mods have done a pretty good job here staying neutral. These new rules recognize this idea. 

Going forward I want to do a better job maintaining this subreddit and updating the FAQ. 

If you have any questions or suggestions for other rules feel free to post them. ",self,t5_2rvat,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/130y3t/hey_rgopro_its_time_for_a_change_please_read_new/

In my experience, and are able to better “absorb” shocks with the core of their body. This causes the overall video to come out smoother.  I've tried filming both ways, and I have found that skiing lent itself to be much easier.  You also have the nice bonus of being able to use one of your ski poles as a mount for your GoPro when filming others. I find that you also have better speed control as a skier, you don't have to rotate your entire body to slow yourself down, but rather you can ""pizza"" brake. Overall, filming while doing either of these will still warrant you great results, however I would prefer to be skiing if I were going to be filming others.

----

With that aside

1. **Pole Mount** - First and foremost is my favorite mount, [or use an old ski pole.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzhFPtH83Mw&amp;feature=related)  The reason I love this mount is because of its versatility, you can use it in a large variety of ways to capture content.

 I highly recommend when you aren't filming yourself with the pole, it is most effective when you are in motion either following the subject, or trailing behind him.  One of the best examples of a follow cam can be seen in several of AbeKislevitz's video's.  He makes use of it several times as a ""follow cam"".  [You can check his videos out here.](http://www.youtube.com/user/abekislevitz).  By watching and analyzing his videos you can get a good idea on how to effectively use the mount to capture certain shots.  An example is putting the camera near the ground (~4 inches off snow) and then panning it up as the rider moves towards the feature.


 In my personal experience

 &gt;The one thing I would like to add from my own experience is when filming others to actually not turn the camera upside down. I tried this for a while

 So next time I get up to the hill I will have to try this out again

 I am sure you have seen video's where people use the pole to film themselves.  In my experience, please don't create an entire video with this shot, it makes the video long and boring.  However, using it in accompany with other shots that help ""place"" the skier in the viewers mind works well.  Think of it as a ""secondary"" shot, that gives depth to the shot.

 There are lots of creative ways to use this mount

2. **Helmet Mount** - This is one of those shots that can be used very effectively, but people love when they get to see the ""riders perspective"" when they complete a certain trick.  Think of a skier doing a rodeo, whenever I see the helmet cam shot, I am tempted to move my head like the skiers.  This really attracts the viewer in, and makes the shot much more interesting!

 There are basically two ways you can go about mounting for this shot, but I would assume that this is due to the improper tightness of the strap.

 Don't just think the front of the helmet is the best place to mount the camera, looking back at them.


3. **Chest Mount** - Lets face it

 When you use this mount, or as he hits a rail.

 Also make sure that you firmly secure the chesty


4. **Boot Mount/Board/Ski Mount** - This is one of the shots where you are going to have to get creative an maybe engage in some DIY. These shots give you nifty perspectives that you wouldn't expect to see.  If you plan on mounting to a ski boot

 I have also seen a few DIY tutorials for mounting it to your Ski/Board.  I have personally never done this

5. **Stationary Mounts** - This all comes down to being creative.  With this, where the skier's skis are splitting the camera.  I've also seen people place them on boxes and have the rider jump over it.  Whatever it is, get creative! It's generally OK if the rider hits it while riding, these cameras are designed to take a beating when they are encased in their housing!


6. **Tripod Mount** - With the [GoPro tripod adapter](http://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Tripod-Mount-HERO-Cameras/dp/B002RCLYXG) you can make a good assortment of mounts. I used some pvc and a 1/4""-20tpi bolt to make a short pole mount for under $10.  This can be used in a variety of different ways, or as a ""starter piece"" in a lot of DIY mounts.


7. **Scorpion Mount** - I have never used it before


8. **Head Swivel Mount** - Did you see in the new Hero3 video where Eric Willet (Snowboarder) has the camera directly in front of him, and 2 [pro poles!](http://www.rhinocameragear.com/Rhino%20Products/GoPro%20Camera%20Mounts/Pro-Pole)

**There are plenty of other ways to mount the camera as well


-----


I've also created a little list of things I try and focus on when I am filming others:

* Get way closer then you think you need to be! The FOV of the camera is really wide

* Make the rider the focus of the shot

* Absorb the bumps! Nobody likes shaky footage.

* Try to film when the sun is ""beside"" you instead of ""above you.  This usually tends to be early morning or later in the afternoon.  This helps keep the shadows from becoming too harsh

* Film everything


* Buy more batteries! When it gets cold outside

I am Matthew with GoPro's UGC department. I have the glorious duties of finding crazy/awesome/cute/epic/moving footage that people like you create! UGC stands for 'User Generated Content'. What we do is we license the raw footage from the person(s) who shot the footage to store in our content library. Our editors would then make an edit with that footage and if all is gravy

This is by no means a sales pitch


Here is an example of a web video that an 'average Joe' shot that became a web edit:

The things we look at the most is the quality and the story of the content. Very key. I browse this site EVERYDAY and love the stuff you guys have been outputting! Keep it up and keep creating!

The HD Hero 3 is a huge step ahead of the HD Hero 2. People are going to love these cameras. We will offer three models; the HD Hero 3 White Edition, including the Chest), but it's much thinner than the HD1/ HD2. The HD Hero 3 + Backpack is the size of todays camera by itself. All three models will come shipped with the new housing which incorporates an underwater lens into the housing and an improved locking latch. The camera needs to work as well under the water as above the water since it's waterproof. We did have to go to the Micro SD Card format since SD Card Trays are way to big for this camera. There are ton of other improvements; I'll send out a Camera Comparison Sheet once we have that and are allowed to send images.

Camera Line Up:

HD Hero 3 White Edition - $199 Retail. This is basically an HD Hero 1 Camera (5mp photo sensor, thinner form factor. Available 10/21/12 to ship.

I have an idea for a film that will only work with the participants of many Redditors (20+) It may or may not have been done before

I want to create a short film, unknown towns, with interesting features.  
Another idea (which is similar) is to show the diversity and differences of one thing across all our different towns. For example, then a shot of a sunset in a town 2000 miles away on a different continent - a sunset is just an idea so you can understand the concept.

Only requirement would be that you have a GoPro (any model that shoots 1080p) and are willing to do a Video Timelapse and upload it somewhere (probably a Dropbox account or something)

If you are interested



**EDIT:**


Lots of responses from all over the world

I agree that it could get boring filming the same thing over and over

FatShadyLives idea is really cool too, be it removing the camera for a quick shot of London Bridge and then putting it back in the bag, or bringing out the camera for a quick snowboard jump before putting it back in the bag. Again with the locations added to each clip.


**EDIT 2:**


So far we have:

Toronto, Australia. Ecuador. Finland. Oslo, Norway. Tasmania. Hawaii. Aruba. Vinena, Austria. Dublin, Ireland. Germany. London, UK. Thetford, UK. Colchester, UK. Edinburgh, Spain. Oklamona, USA. Seattle


**EDIT 3**


I commented this but for those who didnt see it

I have created a new subreddit
You can upload clips to your site of choice and then post the link on r/goprofilm. I will go through and download the clips over the next month or so.

Lets try and make everything the same:
*1080p 
*Mp4 only 
*10-15 seconds of timelapsed sped up footage per location (this will be edited down) doesnt matter if eggtimered or not
*Title the clip as city_country_redditusername.mp4 I will add the titles when editing.


A little tip for people, speed it up and then en-code straight to the MP4 you are planning on uploading. Youtube isnt great because it hugely reduces video quality when I download the compressed version. Vimeo is great, just make sure its downloadable :) Mediashare etc are all fine too. If anybody has any suggestions for places to upload please feel free to share.",,False,self,t5_2rvat,,http://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/1bkhg7/gopro_collaborative_film_whos_up_for_it/

There's one big factor that means I won't be buying a Hero 3

I'm writing this in part because I know some of the people at Gopro frequent this forum

The Hero 3 seems to me to be a great step up

The thing is, bacpacs and so on) than I have the camera itself. I use mine for scuba diving, so need much of this stuff to take a decent video.

If gopro are heading the way of a new model every year (with feature and price creep) and poor legacy support

With a product like this

Let me run through what won't work:

* I have several extra memory cards. No good now.
* I have an extra battery. It won't work.
* I have a LCD bacpac that IS backwards compatible (yay) but it is unclear at the moment how it will work in terms of the new housing. With the current backdoor just slot into the new housing?
* I have a current filter that fits the dive housing for the hero 2. Because the housings are so different, as it won't work on the Hero 3.

And so on. 

Good design, I would pace my purchases very differently.  

Corporate philosophy towards legacy customers is important to me. Brand loyalty is a two-way street. With rumors already circulating about a more expensive

1355303428.0,14pv5b,Hero 3 Black issues I have faced and solved. (May help you out),icarelessi,51,5,55,"Hello fellow Hero 3 owners.

I just received my Hero Black yesterday

Some of the issues were: Freezing and not powering up, SD err message, Wifi not connecting (remote and phone).

So here are the solutions that worked for me:

1)**Freezing and not powering up**: The Camera would be fine for a bit

**Solution**: This is telling you the battery is low. I noticed the camera takes a long time to charge, the camera is fully charged. If you have a wall mount charger (like for an i phone) then plug that into the camera; it charges much faster this way.

2)**Freezing after being plugged into the computer**: After having the camera plugged into my computer it would not turn on. I saw the charging symbol

**Solution**: If the display is on, try removing the SD and battery and trying to charge after replacing the battery alone. Leave it on until the light turns off so you know its fully charged.

3)**Cameras first video only records for a bit

**Solution**: The solution that seems to be working for everyone is saving the files you want to keep and wiping the SD card clean. This issue can be caused by ""ghost"" files on the SD which can bug it up. Make sure to delete ALL files off the SD and let the GoPro re-format the card. Once it's formatted the issue should stop. Repeat if it comes up again.

4)**SD ""err"" (error) message**: The GoPro will display an ""err"" message on the screen. 

**Solution**: This usually is caused by the card being formatted to a separate device. Delete all the files off the device, then look into the card being the issue. Also, if the card has been formatted to the GoPro, then it will say ""DCIM"" and ""MISC"" on the card after there was nothing present from the deletion.

5)**Wi-Fi not connecing to the camera (via remote or phone)**: The Remote and/or phone will not connect to the camera.

**Solution**: Make sure the Wifi is turned on in the camera. Go to the settings menu (picture of a wrench) and cycle through until you get to the ""wireless controls"" menu (looks like a sun) Enter the menu until you see ""Wi-Fi RC."" select it then select ""current"" or ""new connection"" once you have done so it should be good to go. Make sure the BLUE light on the camera is flashing to interact with the remote. Connect the camera to the remote

I also added the sunshade to slightly improve the picture quality while protecting the lens from some minor falls.  The wide angle still works with the sunshade on.  It is also compatible with all the bacpac accessories.  Using the GoPro in anything other than 16:9 means the hood will be visible in the picture or video.

Because I designed it to have a bacpac accessory item on it a majority of the time

I was in at the local Best Buy picking up some things for work

When I got to the end cap

I couldn't keep my mouth shut, and that I planned on getting the HERO3 before my next big trip.

The customer, difficulties, pricing, etc.  The employee ended up walking away while we were talking.

15 minutes later


**TL;DR**- Word of mouth is a million times more effective than poorly trained chain store employees.

Anyone ever have a similar experience?

You will need:
 
- A GoPro Camera that shoots 60+ frames per second

- [GoPro Cineform Studio](http://gopro.com/3d-cineform-studio-software-download/)

**Step 1**

- Open up Cineform and click the blue button labeled **import new files** and find your video file
- (You can also simply drop the file in the box on the left)

**Step 2**

- Click and see your video in the [viewer](http://imgur.com/XeWobwZ) (here you can set the in and out points
- Notice my video was shot on 60.73 frames per a second. You must shoot in 60 fps or higher if you would like your slow motion to be smooth.
- Here, but will look smooth while in slow motion.

**Step 3**

- Click **Advanced Settings** 
- You will see a [small box](http://imgur.com/523NZ1R) fall down with a few settings.

**Step 4**

- Image Size: Source Video (whatever resolution you shot at)
- Frame rate: Depending on your original frames per second
- Quality: I personally like it to be on HIGH
- Remember setttings for future clips: If you have multiple clips
- [This is how I like my settings.](http://imgur.com/nutaQ56)
- Click OK

**Step 5**

- You can change your video's file name to whatever you like
- Click **Add Clip to Conversion List** [like so](http://imgur.com/M7QTcE2)
- Now you can either convert the video
- Click **Convert**

Now your converted video is [twice as long](http://imgur.com/2VW0a44)

Like many of you, so I've come up with an idea... I also am a complete novice with editing, and the only way to improve is to get your hands dirty and do it. Brace yourself, because this idea might suck.


How about once a month (or quarter even?) we decide on a topic or theme

* Underwater themed video
* Film
* Something filmed entirely in the first person *(head mount)*
* ?????

What do you think? Would anyone else be into this? I guess for a 'prize'

So about 2-3 weeks ago there was talk about external USB batteries

Low and behold I purchased [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/221190580753) for about $22
Here are some pictures [link](http://imgur.com/a/lXomO) to give you an idea on size and weight. 

* The Video test:

So first lets see how much life this has recording video. Full batteries (interal GoPro stock battery and the chinese external), this is more then enough for anyone to get through a day with a single MicroSD card. In all honest I should have recorded it on loop mode and noted the start time. If people are interested enough in this, I can do it, but I figured most people would be interested in just knowing if they could record until the SD card filled up.

* The Timelapse Test:

Longest settings possible, so if the LEDs start turning off you are running near the end of the batteries charge.


Future: My next test will likely just be to see how long can I get through a week without a wall charger and simply using this to charge my iPhone 4. 


 **TL;DR/Summary**

It works awesome for $22. Will fill a 64 GB with video before it dies (at 1080 60FPS) or last 15 hours with a 60 second timpelapse interval. Just simply useful to have in your backpack for charging your phone or tablet as well

Still skeptical if it is truely 20000 mAh (should open it up


EDIT:

It took me about 14 hour or more to charge it with an OEM iPhone 4 1A charger. ",self,t5_2rvat,1363233722.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/1a8zf5/20000_mah_external_battery_pack_review_for_rgopro/

** Can't Decide which model to pick? Take a look at this table. **

**What SD Card should I buy?**

GoPro recommends SanDisk or Kingston cards for all their cameras. For the Hero2, we recommend you purchase a class 10 memory card.

The Hero2
The Hero 3 uses a MicroSD card.

**How do I update my firmware?**

There are two ways

**How do I make a time lapse?**

The simplest way is using GoPro's free Cineform Studio Software. Once you've downloaded that

**Are the hero2 bacpacs compatible with the hero3? Mounts?**

Yes on all accounts. All except the Wifi BacPac since Wifi is built into all Hero3s.

**Which Model should I buy?** 

For info-graphic lovers [click here](http://i.imgur.com/7fmTM.jpg)

Here are my thoughts on an answer:
There are currently 4 generations of GoPro out on the market in one form or another.

**Hero960** – This is a mostly obsolete generation, the Hero960 featured most of the specs as the HD Hero but at a fraction of the cost and missing a few features. Among them, the Hero960 was shorted a few shooting modes (no high frame rates or full 1080p HD), and was created without the ability to use the BackPac accessories. It was much cheaper at the time, but there is not a lot of value in getting one today when there are significantly more advanced models available for a similar price.

**HD Hero** – This is the second generation of GoPro cameras

**HD Hero2** – This is the third generation of GoPro’s line, more resolution options, faster frame rates, and a significantly improved user interface.

**HD Hero3** – The fourth and current generation of GoPro is segmented it three variants: The White, lighter, etc) than the previous generations, the White and Silver edition cameras mimic the features of the HD Hero and Hero2, respectively. The Hero3 Black Edition differentiates itself as the flagship model, sporting unprecedented shooting resolutions, frame rates

So where do YOU fit into the GoPro family? Well, and the Professional.
A general consumer is someone who watches the ads, using free tools available to them for editing.

The “Prosumer” is a mix of the general consumer and the professional market. They’re not completely uneducated about cameras, etc. Often Prosumers will self-educate to raise themselves closer towards the Professional level.
The Professional user is exactly like what it sounds like. Well-versed in photo and videography, as they want to have every capability to use their camera the way they want to.

Chances are, and knowing what you are can help identify which GoPro might be best suited for you.

* General consumer– If you’re just looking to try this out for the first time, while a bit pricier, features the improved UI, the smaller design, and built in Wifi capability. Original Hero accessories will be cheaper, but not as readily available. Hero3 White edition will have more expensive accessories, but you will be able to stay current with any new accessories GoPro releases. If you’re planning on getting more serious with this, try an original HD Hero to help you decide if this is for you.

* Prosumer – Chances are, you’re probably interested in some of the deeper capabilities of the GoPro, and want to explore doing things where faster shooting modes and more advanced features are available. If that sounds like you, a HD Hero2 or Hero3 Silver edition might be perfect for you. Like the HD Hero and Hero3 White Edition relate to each other, the Hero2 and Hero3 Silver Edition share most of the same specs with each other… the Hero3 Silver edition again features the new size, built in wifi, etc. Similarly, but for a higher price, you probably want the Hero3 Silver Edition.

* Professional – If you’re on the professional level… or are on the upper level of Prosumer and maybe would LIKE to be there (Say, the Hero3 Black Edition is the only camera for you. The Black Edition features all of the new perks of size, sharper lens, improved sensor, built in wifi, etc… but it also features unprecedented shooting modes like720p at 120fps, 4k at 15fps, but that also often requires a little more work in post process to get what you want out of it. If you’re looking for room to grow as a GoPro user,self,

1350594579.0,11plhx,Some technical information about GoPro's wifi for the geeks out there,klinquist,28,6,24,"This is true for the Hero2 &amp; wifi bacpac

There are two wifi modes that you select on the camera:  ""Wifi remote control""  or  ""Phone and tablet"" mode.

When in Wifi remote control mode

When in Phone &amp; Tablet mode

The wifi bacpac runs its own DHCP server.  It gives itself the IP address 10.5.5.9 and gives clients the IPs 10.5.5.109, etc.  The iPhone app automatically tries connecting to 10.5.5.9 upon launch - no way to specify an alternate address.

The wifi bacpac has ports 80 &amp; 8080 open.   You can browse to port 8080 in your web browser and see a ""cherokee"" web server landing page along with folders for videos

I did some packet capturing with WireShark and found the iPhone app sends commands to the bacpac on port 80.  It issues HTTP GET commands such as:  


GET /bacpac/se?t=[yourWPAkey]  HTTP/1.1  


GET /camera/PV&amp;t=[yourWEPkey]&amp;p=%02 HTTP/1.1     (this seems to be for the live preview)  


Replies seem to get sent to port 60187 on the iPhone.  I have not yet been able to remotely control the GoPro from the command line of my computer

I was able to make the GoPro accessible from my home network (rather from the GoPro's own wifi network) with a wireless bridge and a static route.   With a VPN it'd be pretty easy to make your GoPro accessible from anywhere.


Just about the cheapest router or wireless bridge you can buy these days is a Raspberry Pi ($35) with a USB NIC or two ($10ea).     You could also use this to perform lots of automated things with the GoPro - I'd love to hear others' ideas. 

Hope this helps people out!

1364605829.0,1ba0ot,GoPro Generic Battery Comparison,Jimmyboy_101,20,0,14,"Hi Everyone

Just Thought I would post up a comparison i have done between The Original GoPro Battery I got with the camera and some Generic Batteries i got off ebay.

**Link : AUD




I picked 3 batteries and a charger up for 27AUD

I have used each of the batteries atleast twice to make sure they charge

I used the test generic battery  as my main battery for about a week



**Test : Gopro3Black set to 1080/30fps

* Generic Battery 1 : 1hr 11 minutes 5 seconds
* GoPro Battery : 1hr 9minutes: 6 seconds. 



The gopro battery is 2 months old and probably has been charged around 20 times. 

It hasnt been looked after to nicely as its my only battery so i try and make sure its fully charged everytime i go out to use it.




**Obviously buying Cheap Chinese Batteries comes with its own risks:**

The Batteries are working well at the moment
Cheap Li-ion batteries do have a tendency to swell whilst being charged. For this reason i would recommend only charging them in the wall charger. If they swell in your gopro you might struggle to get it out. 


I have had quite good luck with Chinese batteries. however i understand it is hit and miss.

I would definitely buy again. if 1 stops working in 6 months i will go and buy 3 more.

 I understand you do get what you pay for so I'm not expecting much from these batteries however for the moment they are great!

If anyone wants to run a similar test with a Wasabi go for it! if anyone else has had good/bad experiences with these batteries please post.",self,t5_2rvat,1364606751.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/1ba0ot/gopro_generic_battery_comparison/

The reason for using the wiki and not the default FAQ setup is that we can all edit it at some point. I can approve certain people to edit and maintain this wiki and it will be a lot easier to maintain than going on the honor system. 

I'm hoping to launch it this weekend. So far it will contain all the information captured in the current FAQ linked in the side bar plus some other things. 

I get my Hero 3 Black tomorrow and hope to crank out a bunch of videos on how to use your GoPro. Noob stuff for the most part but editing, slowmo, will all come next. 

Work is being done behind the scenes and I'm hoping we can really turn this wiki into a real learning tool. It's going to take the effort of a few of us and not just me so if you have suggestions for guides that aren't already in the current FAQ leave a comment below.
