xoxo 

edit: What an awesome night you guys! I wish every one of you could have been there. It was very *heavily* photographed and recorded

Joel was so gracious and amazing. My boyfrient and i were about five feet away from him during the interview, and of course the graphics were rad too. All of the staff was super gracious, and what a bitchin venue too, at an art/music gallery on LaBrea... oh and i can't forget the open bar with select Patron drinks (including a deadmau5 margarita) and a few bottled beers; i had a stella. 

At the very end we went around the side door and he *signed* my boyfriends FeedMe hat and my cell phone case. We also walked away with a few of the amazing posters from the night and of course some deadmau5 glow ears. 
I'm still trying to take it all in

So I get to work and see that there is a reservation for ""Neff"". I was like ""Oh! What if its Shaun Neff?"" Soon enough, never really said please or thank you. But as he was walking out of the restaurant, I stopped him and said ""Hey Shaun, I just wanted to let you know how much I love your stuff. By far my favorite brand."" He looks at me like ""Oh shit, he knows who I am."" I then said ""Yeah, I love all the Neffmau5 stuff, its pretty freaking cool."" He said ""Yeah, he's a homie."" I asked what he is like. He said ""He's really cool. He's got a bunch of good ideas. I'm actually meeting up with him on Thursday to talk about a new line that I want to do."" I said ""Oh yeah! Now that he's living with Kat in LA, where he'll play every 4 months.""

I love the logo and the song so I decided to get some made! The size is 4"" by 4"" and I have plenty.

If you're interested I'm selling them for $5 shipped anywhere!

You can send money to my Paypal (bzivko@gmail.com) and I'll ship them out once a week! Make sure to include your shipping address!

If this does well enough I'll look into getting more designs cut!

&gt;me
&gt;The world is and always has been a seemingly scary place. From cavemen too freaked out to go outside at night coz of that fuckin bear or tiger running around eatin shit
&gt;me?  im not much. im a musician in my 30’s with a privileged lifestyle in terms of most, awarded with personal views, whether i choose to express them is entirely up to me.
&gt;As a species, the simple solution here is to just HEY lets all just get together, share the same beliefs and work at our problems as a single unit”  that’s not going to happen soon. Not in my lifetime i feel.
&gt;In fact, it’s an all encompassing giant, spanning across virtually every topic conceivable, not just “hey check this guy out”.  everything from “sup twitter im taking a shit”  to “Konys a big asshole” to “stop this privacy bill” … we can’t very well distrubute the weight of the entirety of social media on ONE issue or topic… but sometimes we do for some reason, which is the result of a “trend”.. Some trends benefit the personal success of a single entity, some draw attention to causes, and others let me know just how biebers hair is fuckin doin.
&gt;you obviously cant measure the actual “value” or “score” of a trend in terms of its nobility, sometimes it seems all you can do is just follow the numbers.
&gt;If i had to interpret trends as “information” my view on the world would probably be, syria is burning, snookis pregnant, lol, were all watching the grammys coz yeah, its the grammys, and oh theres some war criminal in Uganda exploiting children, that makes me mad
&gt;yeah, AND IM NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE”
&gt;well YES… i do get a lot upset inside when war is waging in other lands, maybe spread a little more “awareness”.  But to me “awareness” is a funny thing…
&gt;So there i was standing outside my house as it was burning down. To create awareness, i facebooked, “HOLY FUCK, EVERYONE… MY FUCKING HOUSE IS BURNING DOWN” everyone came over… and we were all very upset, we talked about it, we raised more awareness… yeah.. everyone was well aware that my shit was burning down. Then my fucking house burnt down.
&gt;What would have been awesome is if people brought a hose
&gt;So obviously, how much action is possible? obviously if it were a matter of simple math, say for every 10 people who knew about something then one person does something, then ergo, the more awareness the better…. but a funny thing happens with social media…. weve got awareness overload… what action can be taken across such different world views?  Im not debunking any particular cause or claim here… but i just feel like the world is so far separated in belief systems and cultures that we need to overcome QUITE a few more global conflicts and culture clash before we can globally solve a problem overnight.
&gt;I dont know, a culture, WE HAVE THAT SHIT DOWN.  Let’s focus a little more on what kinds of peaceful resolve and positive action *insert grain of salt here* (according to our western values) can be taken to resolve a global issue. By asking the people claiming to be the “frontmen of the cause”  (which is no doubt, usually a noble cause) who are asking for money or attention, WHERE is this going, HOW is it getting there, WHERE is the data, and most importantly what are the predicted results.

Edit: I'll be collecting names till tomorrow at 11:15 est. 

Update: we have a winner: muterevised

More info: there was a total of 27 people that signed up for the giveaway. I checked the comments &amp; posts of each user (I didn't really want to give it to a dbag) but each member was cool and respectful in all their comments and posts. This is why I love reddit and try to help out with the community any way I can. If for some reason muterevised can't make it I will pick a new name and let you know ASAP.
