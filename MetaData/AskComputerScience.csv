Oh well
I was really good CS student in my college up until my second year.
My father passed away then. I had to skip classes as I really needed sometime to get over it.

And that period when I skipped the classes we started to learn about ""Data structures and algorithms"" and these topics are essential for CS students.  I really felt that I was behind.. so I had to study these concepts on my own and cram everything all at once.

I started to kind of ""hate"" my major.

I don't feel like programming anymore due to the pressure that my school put on me.

Now I feel like studying again on my own though.

BACKGROUND:  Many traditional cryptosystems are built so that to ""break"" the system, one has to be able to solve the ""Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem.""  One of the reasons ECC is useful, according to every book I read, is because there are subexponential algorithms which solve the regular Discrete Logarithm Problem, but the best current algorithm to solve the ECDLP runs in O(sqrt(n)) - this is supposedly indicating the ECC system is harder to break. 


 Every single book I read seems to say this but this is really confusing me.  What's so bad about an O(sqrt(n)) time solution?  I guess I'm confused because back in my original programming class

another quote:

1367381790.0,1dgnzf,Question: Trying to Understand P vs. NP,redmouse9,11,1,15,"Edit:
Some background material and links so we can all be on the same page. (Flebron


Here's a **[Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Formal_definitions_for_P_and_NP)** to the formal definitions of P &amp; NP I've been looking at.


My understanding so far of NP--please correct to 100% if you know better:
NP is a description of algorithms that do not run in polynomial time, which means you can check the answer quickly. An example of an NP algorithm that I stole from somewhere then trampled, would be


Given a set of numbers {-16, -9, 2, 22, -17, 11} select a subset that adds up to 0. 


While it's easy to verify that -16 + -8 + 2 + 22 = 0

Another example is that it's easy to multiply two prime numbers together


The question researchers have been trying to figure out for the last 40+ years is whether this NP class of algorithms, called P; P includes the set of algorithms that a computer can answer in polynomial time.


Researchers define these algorithms in such a way that one specific question can be transformed into another. Making it that if someone can prove P = NP


If P = NP, and the incredibly hard time that the computer and math guys have had trying to prove it one way or the other, most researchers have suspicions that P does not equal NP.

A definition of NP:

NP is made of three components according to the definition at the Wikipedia 
**[Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Formal_definitions_for_P_and_NP)** I found.

x: a non-deterministic (slow) Turing machine that can answer cool questions.

y: a P-style Turing machine that can answer simpler questions quickly.

R: a relation R(x

x and y have a member set 'Epsilon' and it's functions '\*' with the same membership. R has a member set equal to the square of the size of x's membership.

y, i.e. n*z^2 + n*z + n, except increased in the number of exponent pieces x^4, x^5, .... x^n, based on the complexity of the input.


I see different ways to interpret NP.

1. If I create an index between of all the relations between the questions and my inputs--R(x, quickly, with my uber-index.


2. Epsilon^\* is a count of the variables &amp; operations given to the Turing machine, with two points a slope, then three points a curve, and so on. So the hardest a question could get is equivalent to a polynomial up to exponent n, where n is the count of variables given.


I have figured out that at the very least, P=NP, because it makes the whole relation between them **easy**. This only proves one special case, not the whole question.

...

...
So here are the questions from my original post:


I'm trying to better understand in the definition of the Computational Complexity class NP

1. It defines x and y are members of the finite set 'Epsilon' and its associated functions. 
I can interpret it in two ways--one as the range of the value input i.e. 1-100


2. R is defined as a pairing relationship between x


3. I can interpret R as a full indexing of the relationships between x


4.  Does R map a y that replicates x


5.  Would it be practical to manipulate the terms algebraically


6. R and y are subject to big O--does that make them analogues of the computational class P by themselves?

1347077745.0,zjjod,Questions about post-college job prospects as a CompSci major.,qaruxj,9,1,11,"**tl;dr:** Are the claims of a massive shortage of CompSci majors true

I've seen a few articles talking about how there's going to be some huge shortage of Computer Science majors in the US come 2016 (which is about the time I'll be graduating)

First, since my university doesn't like to give scholarships to freshmen. Later, I expect this to subside since I'll be getting a job, hopefully scholarships, and will also be required to do a couple of paid internships my senior year that will pay $40,000, which obviously should help me out quite a lot, much of them accumulating debt over the 4+ years (my department says that, I expect that I will probably do at least that).

Right now, having seen what's happening to all these people who've graduated with way better and more specific degrees and still failed to find a job, but I want to know how accurate these shortage claims are. Employment opportunities are not my only concern, because I do want to major in something that interests me, but when I see these claims that other Engineering degrees aren't experiencing much of a shortage while Computer Science majors are looking at crazy opportunities in four years' time, it really makes me want to stick with CompSci at all costs, just so I know I can have a good job that pays decent money.

Getting to actual questions:

First, which obviously sounds really appealing and too good to be true, but also would be so beneficial to me in terms of job opportunities and salary that it's hard for me to really weigh it equally.

Related to that

Second, but if it's a million small business owners who want me to set up their network for them and build a custom Access database to track their orders in, I'm probably not going to be very happy.

Third, but if it's the small businesses I mentioned or something like that, I could see them going down because they're mostly intended to replace whatever the owner or their kid threw together and not increased demand in the same way that every major company needing a lot more software developers would be. I guess this is a largely irrational concern, but the reason I bring it up is, if I would end up making a similar salary to any of the other jobs that might interest me, I would not be quite as attached to CompSci as I am now.

What should I do? I really doubt I could do well in a GRE subject test

My major GPA (math) is low (3.40) because I have a lot of B's (more B's than A's as you can tell). I have all A's in my minor (Information Systems) and my overall GPA is 3.66. Part of the reason for the low GPA was because I was trying to read up on cs stuff on the side and didnt' get homework turned in on time. I worked part-time but I am not going to be a cry baby about it. It was not like didn't have any time to do homework. In retrospect

I guess you would ask what I would do with a graduate degree. It sounds cliche but I genuinely want to learn. I have no dreams of being rich or famous (not from writing code at least) but I do want to be a part of (Is it a no-no to think of computer science as a part of mathematics?) this community and maybe some day contribute in my own small way.

I am currently a second year student studying at Michigan Technological University and I major in Computer Science. The major has been great it itself and I have loved the small nuances that make it so much more different to anything I had previously done in highschool and other learning environments. However


Michigan Tech is a very small school in comparison to many others and it has a lot to offer in different areas. Unfortunately


I realize that in the field of CS a lot of everything has to do with your ability to code (duh). But would a better college be worth transferring for? Would dropping scholarship money to go to a better institution be a good move? I think that I would very much like the idea of leaving this place and never coming back

 

Anyway thanks for reading everyone. I really appreciate it. 



Summary:  Should I try to transfer to an above average school I might like just purely based off the idea that there might be more opportunity to explore and get me out of a place that I do not like? Or is sucking it up for 3 more years and building a somewhat of a good resume off of what the school gives me the best plan of action?

To start it off, there's a lot of variation in the use of the term.

I think we can all agree that the cornerstones of such a degree would be math and computer science. Besides a small core in each area (e.g. covering calculus/lin alg/disc. math/algorithms etc.)

My own suggestion would be to focus the comp sci courses in the areas of data mining, probability and statistics and numerical methods would be relevant.

I understand this is what assembly coders tend to use in assembly competitions. This area seems very interesting to me to use as a form of compression.

I have the idea of the using rainbow tables

Say you want to compress a 60466176
If I created a rainbow table of numbers (which is extremely NP hard) that could be expressed in a simplistic mathematical form

To create a rainbow table of simple equations like this for large numbers would obviously be NP hard

I could use other mathematical operators such as factorial to express larger numbers.

1332202535.0,r4a71,How would a no-kernel operating system work?,absolutezero1287,8,3,10,"Hello all. I'm an Information Technology major but I've always been really interested in how operating systems work and software in general. I'm no computer scientist so you'll have to forgive my naivete on the subject. 

Note: This is not intended to start a microkernel versus monolithic kernel debate

I've heard arguments on both ends about microkernels versus monolithic kernels. The most convincing argument I've heard is that one large program becomes increasingly hard to maintain as more code is added to it. So why not use an operating without a kernel? Why not break up all of the functionality of the operating system into many small components? Won't it be easier to maintain in the long run and arguably more scalable?

Let's say this hypothetical OS is made up of a few programs that are organized into groups. The ""core"" group of programs provides very basic functionality. In order to have something workable you'd need to build upon core.

Core includes the following:

* Procserv: Process scheduling

* Janitor: Memory management garbage collection

* Auth: Various authentication services including security for IPC

* Bus: Provides basic functionality for the implementation of a bus like USB or PCI

* Dep: Manages program dependencies

Now we have the core groups of programs running so that we can build up our OS to be something decent and workable. Lets say we want to implement USB. Could a ""USB"" program be written that inherits the functionality that's already available via ""bus""? I'm thinking about inheritance like what you get in object-oriented programming languages. 

Would this kind of system even be possible and if so what would be the pros and cons?

I'm obviously leaving out a ton of stuff but like I mentioned before this is all conjecture and I'm no OS expert by any stretch of the imagination.

INPUT STRINGS. An input string is a single line to standard input that is terminated by a new line. Only printable characters are allowed; unprintable characters are treated as a newline character. Reserve the poundrel ('#') for the empty string.

STATE TABLES. The input programs are written using the five column notation we used from the beginning

Explaining
has the option of use one of the ""recovery functions"" `reciprocal_of` has prepared or just
handle the error itself (like a regular try/catch). The thing is
then the execution proceeds where it was stopped (inside the chosen recovery)
will be called
like frozing the stack at a certain point
violate the function contract

The advantages I see are based on the idea that the best place to decide *how* to handle an error
is near the error itself
I found is when I'm trying some code on a REPL shell. If a wild exception occurs
catches it and asks you if you want one of the recoveries or just abort the execution. If you take
a recovery

What I want to know is:

 - is my understanding right?
 - How you compare this feature with the current try/catch system and Go error handling?
 - What's the difference of complexity of implement something like that in a programming language?

For linear probing, no duplicates are allowed. So I have to ""search"" for a value before I insert it, right?

That doesn't seem right

I know I won't have to run into the same issue with quadratic probing, I'm not sure how this will work, because I'll also need to search the table to prove that the key to be inserted isn't present.

I'm working with a large dataset of 3D Medical Images (CT scans).  The most common way to delineate organs or other structures in my field is to have someone manually contour them.  Sometimes this contouring includes a preliminary automatic segmentation step

My dataset is someone special in that I have a mix of low and high quality CT scans of the same patient.  More importantly, with abysmal results.

So it seems like the best course of action is to use the information I already have (the contours on the high-quality scans) to do some kind of adaptive automatic segmentation based on known information.

How the hell does this make any sense? Let say there are 5 processes in the queue with CPU burst of: p1=4 p2=6 p3=2 p4=10. After the first process

Edit: After read your comments I think I understand. I'll tell you what I've learned

A burst is not how long the entire process took but how much time a thread (piece of the the process?) is in the CPU before it is preempted (another processes takes it's place?) and goes to wait in the queue until it can finish. 

If a process has had two burst so far, it will enter the CPU at the next time splice and the old process will go back to the queue. 

This prevents an extremely long process from hogging the CPU and allows short processes to move through faster. The result is a lower average processing time (latency?).",,t5_2shke,1373990172.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1ie0xb/cpu_scheduling_shortest_job_first/

Let us suppose that an algorithm to solve NP problems in polynomial time exists, within our lifetimes, so we write an algorithm to find it.  The algorithm doesn't have to be perfect.  We could, for example, iterate through all C programs smaller than a certain size which input a graph of size N, and output whether the graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and test each of these for efficiency.  We would then increase N to see if the efficiency scaled properly, increase the maximum allowed size of the program

I'll level with you from the start and say this is part of an assignment **BUT(!!!!)** I am not after 'answers'

**The Scenario:**
*On a fictitious computer of 32 bits
main memory (physical memory)
used for user processes (i.e.
program requires an array of 1024 elements
this program
2M×1024 = (2×2^20 )×2^10 = 2×2^30 = 2G
For this assignment
1K=2^10=1024 Bytes   
1M=1K×1K=2^10 × 2^10 = 2^20 Bytes
1G=1K×1M= 2^10 ×2^20 = 2^30 Bytes  
Explain how the computer system accommodating the 2G memory requirement by only using 1G physical memory. Assume that the page size is 2M
In your explanation
After reading your answers to the questions
need of referring to any other sources. Simply using a few keys to answer each question won’t attract any mark.  
1. Explain what logic memory addresses are
relationship between them. [1 mark] **Done this part**  
2. What are pages, and a page table? [1 mark] **Done this part**  
3. In this computer system
inside of a page should be 32). [1 mark]   
4. What is the minimum number of page faults incurred for the program to access each element of the array at least once? What situation makes the access of an element of the array longest in terms of time
  
**My Thoughts**  
total physical memory = 2^30  
page size = 2M = 2^21  
  
bits of the logical address space to manage pages=  
(total physical memory) / (page size)  
= 2^30 / 2^21  
= 2^9 = 512 which is how many 2M pages you would create from 1GB correct?  
  
bits used for addresses inside a page  
page size = 2M = 2^21 which means there would be 2^21 storage places (?? not sure what to call this) inside the page. but this this
  
max number of pages = total physical memory / page size  
= 512?  
  
if someone could just point me in the right direction that would be great! haha like i said im not after answers

Usually with ideas like that someone smarter already figured it out and created an open source project

The problem:
We have a web application with sensitive data, which is not optimal. It would be really cool to introduce some third variable into the authorization, something that is not easily bypassed, something like google 2-phase authorization. 

The idea:
When a user is registered, the private key is given to the user. The user saves this key somewhere on their client machine. 
When the user accesses the web application with sensitive data, they must somehow make their private key known to the browser - maybe a lingering popup with a textarea where the private key is pasted and a javascript that decrypts the data on the client, or via a plugin, or some other approach - this is still an open question. 


Of course the user must take care that their private key is secure at their location

What do you think? Is there someone doing something like this already?


EDIT: We already use SSL. Basically username/password security sucks. Imagine the user also has a hotmail account which uses the same username/password combination (because users are lazy) and it gets hacked. The hackers could gain access to the sensitive application very easily. To be really sure of your security you would need another variable - something like TAN numbers that your electronic banking uses to authorize a transaction


EDIT2: Now that I think about it, where they should paste their private key. The form also contains an encrypted token that was generated on the server, which is decrypted using the private key and the resulting decrypted token is then submitted to the server all using javascript. If tokens match user can continue and their session gets flagged as trusted.

I got to wondering about how sorting happens at runtime on an aggregator like reddit

We know that, upvotes, downvotes, constant etc) and assigns a score to each post in order to generate the front page at any given time. This got me thinking about how the server load could be kept as low as possible for each query. 

These are some of my thoughts:

- It would be inefficient (if not impossible) to build a system that, assigned a score, indexed the list of scores, ordered the list and only showed the top 20. 

- Extending that in the opposite direction, the server running the algorithm behind the scenes and constantly over-writing the score field in the submissions table and indexing on each pass? This would makes you question how new content can rise so quickly and also makes you ask how it prioritises content that needs its score updated with much greater frequency (front page content needs to be much more frequently scored and ordered than a subreddit with no new posts for 2 years), so if everything was done behind the scenes how would this prioritisation be calculated?

- Is it a combination of automatic constant background score-updating and running part of the algorithm on page-load? Could

- In a similar vein, and indexing a much more basic, quick algorithm score (including time) as a background process which could then be sorted with more fidelity at run-time?

- What is happening when a user upvotes? Does that action trigger a re-calculation? And if the algorithm is so dependent on time

Please review the following and provide your feedback


P?NP#1:  Draft


Let there be two plateaus


The village chief from the first plateau calls for one of his men and speaks to him. ""I want you to travel through the forest to the village at the other plateau. You are to be an envoy to establish communication between our villages. You are the third envoy I have sent.  Both of the previous envoys perished on the way to the other village."" The chief pulls out a flag. “When you reach the other village


The envoy bowed deeply, he arrived at the other village where he waved his flag. A watchman at the first village saw the signal and relayed the message to the chief, who was glad.



Summary: 
	
That the correct path was found is easily verified.

Finding the correct path was difficult and involved many branches that could not be converted to an easy path.

Therefore there are languages intersecting our physical reality where verifying an act has no relation that makes a difference to the difficulty of accomplishing the act. P ≠ NP.




Q&amp;A with the chief:


Why did you not jump across to the other plateau?

It was too far for anyone to jump. Even with a bow and arrow



Why did you not build a flying machine and fly across?

A flying machine?  Humph. Even if that were possible, and the training required to get a man to fly across would be much greater than the task to send men through the forest.



Could you not signal across to the people there?

&gt;I'll try to elaborate my questions and my current ""understanding"" of the topic.
&gt;
&gt;-----
&gt;
&gt;1/ What is net neutrality? Who is it geared towards (ISP or Cable providers)? Whose/what actions does it mandate? What is expected to happen with
&gt;
&gt;From what I know, Amazon, Netflix for example if the ISP is also a media distributor with conflicted interests like Comcast).
&gt;
&gt;What is confusing here is the distinction between the ISPs and the cable providers. According to Wikipedia, in turn, allow and manage our use of those tubes.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; As an analogy, distribute to users and regulate the traffic (DNS resolution, for example).
&gt;
&gt;-----
&gt;
&gt;2/ How does net bias hamper innovation?
&gt;
&gt;I imagine it has to do with [something like this](http://isen.com/blog/uploaded_images/5z6vt4n-720249.jpg). On the other side of the coin
&gt;
&gt;What isn't 100% clear is how this is different from our currently existing tiered internet service. People and companies **are** paying more for higher quality service. Whether the bandwidth scarcity is artificial or real
&gt;
&gt;One key difference that I can find is that our current mode of discrimination only concerns the quantity, tech startups are already paying more for better service, this argument will fly only if the premium for ""being connected to at all"" is significant.
&gt;
&gt;-----
&gt;
&gt;3/ Regarding the ""privacy concern""
&gt;
&gt;Wikipedia writes the following:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some opponents of net neutrality legislation point to concerns of privacy rights that could come about as a result, there is the concern that ISPs may have profit motives to analyze what their subscribers are viewing, and be able to use such information to their financial advantage. For example, an ISP may be able to essentially replicate the ""targeting"" that has already been employed by companies like Google. To critics such as David Clark, a senior research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the proper question is ""who has the right to observe everything you do""?
&gt;
&gt;How does Net neutrality license ISPs to monitor our traffic?

Due to the fact that the AP test is in JAVA that is the language we will be utilizing.

Any suggestions?

1370415236.0,1fphli,Gap buffer,alphfox,2,1,2,"I'm implementing a gap buffer since it looks the better way to edit a line; it is not to be used into a editor else for the command line.

Note: it is showed a visual representation of the buffer.  
The next printing shows how is working now
The gap slice is moved when the cursor is between data (no home neither end of line) since the user could inset data just there.


**[]rune with len=32**

    Cursor:  0 · Gap start: 15 · Gap end: 31  [***************|_______________|]  

**Data entered: 0-9 so the cursor is in position 10**

    Cursor: 10 · Gap start: 15 · Gap end: 31  [0123456789*****|_______________|]  

**I'm moving the cursor one character to left
after of the cursor is moved after of the gap.**

    Cursor:  9 · Gap start: 14 · Gap end: 30  [012345678*****|_______________|9]  
    Cursor:  8 · Gap start: 13 · Gap end: 29  [01234567*****|_______________|89]  
    Cursor:  7 · Gap start: 12 · Gap end: 28  [0123456*****|_______________|789]  
    Cursor:  6 · Gap start: 11 · Gap end: 27  [012345*****|_______________|6789]  
    Cursor:  5 · Gap start: 10 · Gap end: 26  [01234*****|_______________|56789]  

My question is: When the gap is moved

(a) should be moved at the end of the buffer

      [01234|_______________|56789*****]

(b) after of the gap

      [01234|_______________|*****56789]

(c) or is right like it is now?

They use cubic splines to do bezier interpolation between sample points of the user's drawing. This is pretty straightforward

What I'm not understanding is how they manage to do it in real time. From their code snippets they appear to be drawing each bezier curve one at a time as opposed to waiting for the user to finish drawing the entire curve and then using that to find the control points. If I'm understanding correctly, since they are doing this in real time, there's no way to guess where the user is going to draw next part of the curve. How do they guess the control points with accuracy? 

Only way I can think of is to simply, use a new control point on the same line as the old one and then arbitrarily pick the next one.

There are two types of vehicle, weight, registration no &amp; service history. Some attributes are however unique to one of the two types of vehicle such as trucks having a max cargo capacity vs. tankers having a max liquid capacity and type (i.e. chemicals, oils, foodstuffs).

All users of the system have a username and password which they use when logging on to gain access to their work schedule and in the case of depot managers

A depot manager may assign themselves a work schedule and are thusly drivers themselves. When a depot manager assigns a work schedule

A work schedule initially exists in a pending state with the job start date and time being no less than 48 hours in advance and with a maximum duration of 72 hours. Once the job start date has been passed the work schedule switches to an active state and once the job end date has been passed the work schedule is archived.

From time to time it may be necessary to re-assign a vehicle to another depot. This operation can only be made if the vehicle in question has no currently active or pending work schedule.""

This is the assignment:

The purpose of this assignment is to create a Java applet that uses the graphic APIs to draw a pie chart. This problem is based on a problem from Java Programming by Joyce Farrell. The applet will accept four dollar amounts. Each dollar amount represents an investment with a different amount of risk. These categories are no risk, and high risk. Display a pie chart representing the amounts invested by risk category when the user hits the enter key from the last risk category. The initial user interface is displayed below.

The detailed requirements are listed below.

Create a header for the applet. You may use the same one displayed above - Investment Analysis. This header must use a different font and a different point size from the rest of your text components. Place appropriate directions in the applet window to inform the user what he/she must do to use the applet. Make sure each JTextField object for data entry has a descriptive label immediately to its left.
Each ""slice"" of the pie chart must be a different color. Make sure that all the pieces of the pie add up to a full pie (100% or 360 degrees of the circle). There should be no gaps between the pieces of the pie. You can determine the size of each piece of the pie by dividing the respective amount invested by the total amount invested. For example, $300 in the low risk (yellow) category, and $400 in the no risk (blue) category for the chart above. The high risk piece of the pie can be calculated as 100 divided by (100 + 200 + 300 + 400) or 100 / 1000 or 10%. Therefore the high risk (red) piece of the pie is 10% of the total pie.
Add a legend to the chart that identifies which color represents each of the four risk categories. One way to do this is to have the color of the descriptive label and the color of the dollar amount match the color of the pie slice it represents. This is the method used above. You may also have a separate legend in the applet window that has four rectangles. Each rectangle would be filled with a color from the pie chart. Add a label for each rectangle indicating whether the color it displays is for no risk, or high risk. Your legend must make use of different colors as in these examples.
The height and width parameters of the html APPLET tag ""fix"" the size of applet. Use the FlowLayout to automatically position the Swing components. With these in place
Test your applet with a variety of dollar amounts for the various risk categories. The user must be able to enter dollars (integers). There is no need to enter cents. Make sure your applet and graph still displays appropriately after the window is minimized and then restored.
Do not display the legend or any part of the pie chart before the user hits the enter key from the fourth JTextField object the first time.
You may want to use an array to manage the 4 JTextfield components and the 4 JLabel components for the dollar amounts. However using an array is not required.
Include the html for the applet tag as a comment in your source code. This html will be graded as part of the assignment. It also allows me make sure the Swing components and the pie chart don't overlap.",,t5_2shke,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/v7flk/help_with_japplet_program_please/

How the game works:

1.	A player can play as many times as he/she wants in one session. Each game cost one (1) dollar. 
2.	Player tells program how many games he/she wants to play.
3.	The player enters six (6) numbers from 1 to 40 at the prompt
4.	The program displays the player’s numbers in sorted order.
5.	The program does an instant random drawing. i.e. creates a set of six (6) winning numbers and displays them in sorted order.
6.	The program compares the computer’s numbers to the player’s numbers and reports the payout. 
7.	If the player has additions games to play
8.	At the end of the player’s session, and net gain. Net gain is the difference between amount won and amount wagered.

Payout matrix:

    Match  0  -  “Sorry

I am having trouble deciding between a dual core and a quad core. I plan on the basic web browsing, but I also plan on doing some gaming and maybe a physics learning program. I do not know if a higher GHz with a dual is better than a lower one with a quad. Will a game like Skyrim or a program like DeepSky utilize the four cores or will it be more beneficial to have a higher CPU speed that usually comes with a dual.

1333052947.0,rjscr,Is there a stigma among today's teen gamers against Linux?,pamtaro,2,2,0,"Here's some context to my question:

I studied CS as an undergrad not too long ago (graduated in '08) and I am not a gamer. I learned programming as a teen for fun because I've always been a computer geek. I run Windows, Fedora, and openSUSE today on my desktop, laptops, and VMs. 

I have a little brother who is in high school, Wii, NintendoDS). When I told him he should try out Linux since he likes to mess around with computers and wants to study CS in college, he gave me a reply that came off as disgust for Linux (although this is my interpretation since this was over instant messenger). When I asked him what's wrong with Linux, his initial response was that there was ""no game support"" on Linux. So I argued that you can usually figure out how to play any game on Linux (you just need to jump through a couple extra hoops to do it), gave a bunch of examples of major sites and companies that exclusively run Linux, and told him that if he goes into CS, he responded ""but its Linux!  ಠ_ಠ"" (yes he really does use that emoticon all the time in chats).. 

So to you CS teen and non-teen redditors out there, he said he would, so is it because it's just not popular in the mainstream? ... and am I right that most CS departments in college teach on Linux, so he'll eventually use it anyway? (At my university's CS department, students could use whatever OS they wanted on their personal computers, but the CS labs and department servers run on Linux. So if there was a project you needed to upload to the server for a class, you had to ssh to the CS servers)",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/rjscr/is_there_a_stigma_among_todays_teen_gamers/

At work one of my main tasks is to keep track of which pallets of unlabeled cans are being put on the line for labeling and making sure that the tag information is accurate with which cans are on the pallet by checking the product

What happens is that I scan the standard barcode that represents the tag number and then it retrieves information from the server which brings up a screen that tells me if the pallet is the correct Ship ID and whether or not there is a hold on that pallet which would prevent us from running it through to be labeled and presents me with little textboxes in which to input data. At this point I need to pull a can from the top, a pallet goes through the line every five minutes so, provided everything is running well. This means if you spend too much time trying to get that out you can get behind rather quickly. 

The thing here is that when these are stacked

We are building a couple of websites at our university and now need to consolidate the user databases. We thought of using SSO but don't really know which technology is best practice. We're looking at oauth for authorisation

The websites we are building are going to provide scientists all over the world with datasets and research functionality so there needs to be very little overhead in user registration and login. All websites are independent and built using a mix of technologies

We usually work with the LAMP stack so the SSO service would be running on that.
