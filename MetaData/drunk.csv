So I woke up yesterday, downed a quart of water and some aspirin and went back to bed. I repeated this process about 4 more times until 7pm or so. I then went a got a pizza. It was good. Now, it's Sunday and I really should clean the house up. I don't know when or why, but I attempted spaghetti it seems. This was a fail. Anyway, it's been real and we should totally do this again some time. Cheers!",,False,t5_2ql00,True

Neither Happen..instead the guy tells me that ""WE ARE FUCKING ARM WRESTLING RIGHT NOW!!"" Of all the possible scenarios...this guy wants to fucking arm wrestle in the bathroom of this nasty ass place....(according to my buddies

So we proceed to arm wrestle and I win 3 out of 3 matches...1 being left handed. Each time I win

Fast forward 10 minutes later. I'm sitting at the table with my buddies (who at this point are dying from laughter about my strange situation) and the guy comes up behind me and slaps me on the back of the shoulder and shouts ""HEY MOTHER FUCKER!""

EDIT 2: I've chugged 6 and i'm gettin g a bit full. Don't worry though I'll do as much as reasonably expected. Much love for my favorite subreddit

EDIT 3: Going out to the bar guys! Replies might be a bit slow. If you dont receive your upvote i'll be sure to do it tomorrow. 

EDOT 4: Thanks four the conversatino and comments guys. im pretty lit we're heading back to my place and might play some drining games or something with some beer. Sorry i ddin't get to everyone who commented. Have a happy fucking night guys and gals

EDIT 5: Hey guys, i don't even remember the drinking games. Now I know what feeling like hammered shit means. Luckily at some point I had the foresight to put some bottled water in the fridge last night, so after I brushed my teeth like 4 times I'm on my way to recovery! Again, thanks for the birthday wishes and conversation guys, I had a blast.
