1341382091.0,w0qgf,The official Higgs announcement thread.,Ruiner,6344,3937,770,"In a few hours

(You should also check [the previous Higgs thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/naxmk/the_everything_you_need_to_know_about_the_higgs/) where many of the common questions were answered)

For many reasons, this might be the first and only occasion in our lifetimes in which we get to witness a major experimental discovery in particle physics. 


The LHC was built because we were **sure** that something would be found, both transverse to the direction of propagation of the light beam, W are also polarized in the direction parallel to their propagation. This longitudinal degree of freedom is troublesome, since it makes the probability of collision of W bosons collide grow very fast with the energy, so fast that it crosses the ""unitarity scale"", meaning that the sum of all the probabilities of different ways in which W bosons interact no longer add to 1.


When this happens, at short distances the Ws can also produces a particle and this particle again decays into Ws. Summing up all these contributions, we have again something finite. (Check the last 3 of these [diagrams](http://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img191.gif))


The Higgs - or whatever particle is in there at 126GeV - is very heavy and decays almost immediately into some lighter particles, so we can look for these signals. W bosons are also too heavy to be produced as a final state, so we need something else. We start by shooting protons against each other, and these protons contain 3 quarks each. The quarks can emit W bosons, and the W can also collide and produce a Higgs, as can be seen in this [diagram](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HGd0kIqlg9c/TzHA08T1kSI/AAAAAAAAAk4/oCfwX1eseKQ/s1600/vbf.png). Once the Higgs is produced, it will immediately decay into some light final state such as photons or quarks. What we really observe is an excess in the production of any of these final states when compared to the predictions of the same scattering without the Higgs. And in order to determine if the Higgs is really the Higgs, which means that it has to produce just the ""right ammount"" of each final state.  


So is this guy also responsible for giving a mass to all the particles? Yes and no. In the real construction, and the actual Higgs boson are just the excitations of this field, like ripples on the water. Almost every particle interacts with this field, and by this interaction they become massive.



* What changed since the last announcement?

Now they have more data and it's possible to say with a lot more certainty that there is in fact some particle with a mass of around 126 GeV. We'll have to wait until the announcement to know exactly how certain it is

edit: 
now we have

from CMS: 125.3 +/- 0.6 GeV @ 4.9 sigma

from Atlas: 126.5 Gev @ 5.0 sigma



* Is it the Higgs?

It's needed more data. But their result seems to be compatible with the standard model Higgs.


* What now?

If it's really a Higgs, but it seems that both are very unlikely now.

----------

FAQs (summarized from [the official press release](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/MSLLanding.pdf)):

**What is the purpose of the mission?**

The four stated objectives are:

1. Assessing the biological potential by examining organic compounds - the ""building blocks of life"" - and searching for evidence of biologically relevant processes.

2. Uncovering the geological processes that formed the rocks and soil found on Mars

3. Investigate past and present habitability of Mars and the distribution and cycling of water and carbon dioxide.

4. Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation.

**How was the mission site chosen?**

In line with the mission objectives, leaving behind evidence such as clay and sulfate minerals. The impact that created the crater also revealed many different layers, each of which will give clues on the planetary conditions at the time the material was deposited.

While previous landing sites must be chosen to safeguard the landing of the spacecraft, combined with the mobility of the rover, meant that the mission site can be some distance from the landing site. The primary mission will focus on the lower elevations of the Gale Crater, with possible exploration in the higher slopes in future extended missions.

For a more detailed explanation see [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/wvqwt/why_was_the_curiosity_rover_not_landed_at_the/c5h97sr).

**Why is the ""sky crane maneuver"" to land the rover?**

The Curiosity rover is the biggest - and more importantly, coming at 170 kg each. Prior strategies include landing the rover on legs, as the [Viking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_lander) and [Phoenix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_lander) landers did, and using airbags, as [Spirit and Opportunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_and_Opportunity) did, but the sheer size and weight of Curiosity means those two methods are not practical.

**What happens to the descent stage after it lowers the rover?**

The descent stage of the spacecraft, towards the North pole of Mars, to avoid contamination of the mission site. Currently there is no telemetry data on it yet.

**How long does it take for data to transmit one way between Earth and Mars?**

On the day of landing

See [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xo5vm/how_does_the_mars_rover_curiosity_send_radio/) for more detail.

**What are the differences between this rover and the previous ones landed on Mars?**

For an overview of the scientific payload, [quadrupole mass spectrometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_Mass_Spectrometer) and tuneable laser spectrometer are also part of the payload, not included in the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.

Discussion in comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xr3s0/the_official_mars_science_laboratory_and/c5ouzu6)

**Why were the [first images](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/images/first_images_mars.html) of such low resolution?**

The purpose for the first thumbnail images are to confirm that the Rover has landed and has operational capabilities. These images were taken from the Hazard Avoidance cameras (HazCams)

The Rover has a Mars Descent Imager capable of 1600 x 1200 video at 4 frames per second. The MastCam (with Bayer filter) is capable of 1600 x 1200 photographs

**How is Curiosity powered?**

The Rover contains a [radioisotope thermoelectric power generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator)

[Discussion in comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xr3s0/the_official_mars_science_laboratory_and/c5ouuh8).

**When will Curiosity take its first drive? When will experimentation begin?**

The first drive will take place more than one week after landing. It will take several weeks to a month to ensure that all systems are ready for science operations.

**What are the results?**

[Eric Lander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lander) characterizes ENCODE as the successor to the [Human Genome Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project): where the genome project simply gave us an assembled sequence of all the letters of the genome, it doesn’t tell you what traffic is like at what time of the day, it doesn’t tell you where the good restaurants are, or the hospitals or the cities or the rivers."" In contrast, ENCODE is more like Google Maps: a layer of functional annotations on top of the basic geography.

**EDIT 2**:
First off


There are a lot of common questions in this thread that I would like to address up here.

* Book List (good general reads that give you a sense of how research and discovery go in paleontology):

-*Dinosaurs: The Most Complete

-*The Evolution and Extinction of Dinosaurs* by David Weishampel

-*Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs* by Michael Novacek

-*Digging Dinosaurs*

-*Quest for the African Dinosaurs* by Louis Jacobs

-*Hunting Dinosaurs* by Louis Psihoyos

-*Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters* by Donald Prothero

-*The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt* by William Nothdrurft

* **Advice concerning classes/school/college/how to be a paleontologist:**

Well, this was my course list:

Physical Geology

Physical Geography

Mineralogy

Igneous

Sedimentology and Stratigraphy

Geomorphology

Structural Geology

That covers the geology side, tectonics). You really need a good solid base in geology to understand how time is recorded in the rock!

My paleo courses consisted of the following:

Vertebrate Paleontology

'Invertebrate Paleontology

Paleontology Lab Techniques

Taphonomy

Macroevolution and the Fossil Record

Geobiology

Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy

Dinosaurs (A 101 class I took for fun ;) )

Paleontology is as competitive as any other field. People make a big fuss about jobs being tight, it isn't all in Academia- you can work with museum collections, consulting companies, and colleges or private institutions.

What's it like being a paleontologist? Well, DO IT. Don't look to others for confirmation or support. Support yourself. Be confident in your decisions, and never stop learning. I saw a lot of students begin a paleontology major who did not anticipate the hard-core scientific load they were undertaking. There is a lot of difficult coursework with paleontology. It's not just ""dinosaur appreciation club"". You need to know your shit. You will have to put up with a lot of crap that you don't like. I had to retake calculus 1 five times before I finally passed. Don't get stuck thinking ""why do I need this?"". That is a waste of time, and it will only distract you and drain your energy. Focus on what else you could be doing with your time. Don't be a book worm, either- get out of the classroom and get field experience. Lots of museums look for volunteers for the summer. You don't have to pay to go on an excavation. Take the time to track down some paleontology professors. Hamper them (without being irritating ;) ) and get to know them. A lot of times they will have research projects that you can assist on, and THAT will get you into grad school better than straight A's.

We broke our own rules (non-scientific content on AskScience).  We also broke with the time-honored convention of assuming every redditor is in an American time zone.  

Many of you were not amused by our clear abandonment of the preferred time zones and unsubscribed in protest (though bizarrely we have more subscribers now than when we started).  Those of you who fell for it shouldn't feel too bad: some of our own panelists who missed the memo were even angrier than you. We can all be somewhat proud that some of them resigned in protest

Our modmail and PM volume was much higher than normal - both people who were extremely amused, and got called on to resign (more than once).  

And while we don't like getting angry mail, and we thought it was awesome that so many people were so defensive of AskScience's integrity.  But rest assured: no one is going to be putting any Sponsored Content in, we haven't hired an [inept PR person](http://www.reddit.com/user/sponsoredpr), and the guidelines of the subreddit are firmly in place.

1323780554.0,naxmk,"The ""everything you need to know about the Higgs boson"" thread.",Ruiner,3235,1685,465,"Since the Cern announcement is coming in 1 hour or so

1) **Why we need the Higgs:**

We know that the carriers of the weak interaction - the W and Z bosons - are ~~massless~~ massive (typo).  We observed that experimentally. We could just write down the theory and state that these particles have a ""hard mass"", we break ""unitarity"": probabilities no longer add to 1. 

The way to cure this problem is by adding a particle that mediates the interaction. In this case, called the Higgs boson.

2) **Higgs boson and Higgs field**

In order for the Higgs to be able to give mass to the other particles, they are swimming in this Higgs field, and this interaction gives them inertia. 

But this doesn't happen to all the particles, don't care about the Higgs.

In order to actually verify this model, which we call a photon. 

3) **Does that mean that we have a theory of everything?**

No

4) **What's the difference between Higgs and gravitons?**

Answered [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nafdw/whats_the_difference_between_the_higgs_boson_and/).

5) **What does this mean for particle physics?**

It means that the Standard Model, since it would shed no light on these two subjects.

6) **Are there alternatives to the Higgs?**

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgsless_model). Short answer: no phenomenological viable alternative. Just good ideas

7) **Why do we care about it?**

Ongoing discussion on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nawxu/my_partner_asked_me_why_we_should_be_interested/) thread. My 2cents: We don't know

EDIT: Technical points to those who are familiar with QFT:

Yes, since neutrinos were thought to be massless formerly, but now we know that they have a very very very small mass. 

No, which is essentially the same as taking the self-coupling of the Higgs to infinity and you're left with the Non-Linear Sigma Model of the Goldstones in SU(2). But we know that this is not renormalizable and violates perturbative unitarity.

Our research from [The Rohwer Lab](http://phuckitphage.org/) at [San Diego State University](http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news.aspx?s=74269) investigates a new symbiosis formed between bacteriophage, the slimy, protective coating found in your mouth, lungs, gut, and also on a large number of other animals, such as fish, and worms.

We show that bacteriophage, or head, which grabs hold of sugars found within mucus. These mucus-adherent phage reduce the number of bacteria that grow on 
mucosal surfaces and protect the underlying animal host from infection.

This symbiotic interaction benefits the mucus-producing animal host by limiting mucosal bacterial infections, or BAM for short. BAM could have significant impacts across a diverse number of fields, including, human immunity, prevention of mucosal infections, phage therapy, and environmental/biotechnology applications.

1352484952.0,12x9op,Questions from 2nd Graders about Animals - Students posting from 3:30 - 4:30 EST,Ms_Christine,2601,1182,330,"**UPDATE:  Things didn't quite go as planned.  Turns out Reddit isn't blocked on teacher accounts, which is a shame because as they were starting to see the responses they were getting really excited and generating more questions.  I will be printing out all of your responses and bringing them in on Tuesday for the students to read and use as the basis for their research page.  If they have any further questions or responses

Dear AskScience

First of all

I am currently working with a group of 2nd graders once a week during an afterschool program.  We are working on a project to create a book about animals, and generated questions about that animal.  They have made some predictions about their questions, and are now seeking answers.  We have discussed several ways students can research the answers to their questions.  One resource that isn’t often talked about is asking an expert.  This is where you come in, AskScience!


Our 2nd graders are very eager to learn and are excited about getting to ask scientists about the animals they have chosen.  Some questions are more in-depth than others; as an expert, or prompts that might lead them into asking deeper questions.  On my end, I will be walking around monitoring responses, helping students to understand and respond to the answers, and generate new questions.   When this is over, the students will be writing a few sentences about their animal, will find or draw some pictures, published book.

Please remember that these students are about 7 and 8 years old

Again, please feel free to PM me!

My questions are those in the title, in a classic one with no specifities (just a basic tank full of sea water) ? And second, maybe in a special one, with everything they could need (pressure, special nutriments...) ?

I guess this brings another question such as ""Do they need this high pressure to live ?"" and another ""Could we recreate their natural environment ?""

The previous questions supposed that we had such fishes in our possession, but maybe with a special submarine and a big net... (this sounds a bit silly)...


And then, could they breed ?  


I really don't know much about fishes so sorry if I said some stupid stuff... 
I'm interested and a bit scared of the deep sea world
Thanks a lot for the time you spent reading and maybe answering me.

1319054650.0,lhuiy,Our Community is Growing. Help Us Keep it Clean.,EagleFalconn,3100,1696,225,"**Hi Everyone! And Welcome to New Users!** Ask you have probably heard

As you may have noticed over the past 48 hours, a 7% increase in our population in a single day. As such, I'm going to take this moment to remind you of the rules, or if you're new tell you them for the first time.

**TL;DR: We have rules. Follow them. No herp-derping allowed.**

**The Rules Of AskScience** (Updated Oct 20

1. Here at AskScience

2. Our goal is expert scientific responses to questions. Speculation should be deeply rooted in science, and don't provide good scientific insight, so please refrain from using anecdote to answer questions.

3. We don't answer personal medical questions. While medicine is certainly part of science

4. Before you submit a question

5. We don't do homework help. If you need help with your homework

6. We are not here to discuss religion outside of the context of sociology. As such

7. Open ended questions with no specific answer are prohibited.

**How The Rules are Enforced**

As moderators, make sure that questions get answers. Every once in a while, one of us will go through a thread and clean up any comments we feel are veering out of control. But we **need your help!** There are only so many of us, and we can only catch so much. *I'll say it again. We cannot do this without your help.*Here is how you can help us enforce the rules:

*This section updated Oct 28

If you see a comment that isn't following the rules

More explicitly

1. Jokes in top level comments.

2. Memes.

3. Conversation not directly related to the question or a follow up question. 

4. Speculation.

5. Anecdotes.


**Panelists**

One of the most important mechanisms for making sure questions get answered is our panelist system. Panelists are people who have informed us that they are REAL scientists who are taking the time to answer questions here. Their specialties are noted by the colored tags next to their names

Just because someone is a panelist doesn't mean they are right though! Ask them follow-up questions

Also keep in mind there are other experts who frequent AskScience. Just because someone isn't a panelist doesn't mean they are wrong!

**Not Interested in Science?**

Okay by us! If you're not interested in seeing content from AskScience, you'll see a red button that says ""Unsubscribe."" Click it and AskScience will stop showing up in your Reddit front page unless you click subscribe later.

**Why are we doing this?**

Over the past couple of days

The past 48 hours have been very exciting but also a lot like drinking out of a fire hose for the moderation team. But we believe that trying out being a default subreddit is a worthwhile experiment for us. We know that because of the community that we have built and the strong moderation we have become known for that there is a lot of good and we want to see that grow. It is an *experiment* and if in a week or two we decide that we cannot both be a default subreddit and maintain high quality

You may have noticed a lot more off-topic conversation in the past 48 hours. We have been doing our best to try to keep this under control, because we really do believe that this is blog post exposure, not new users. We've been informally keeping track and about 95% of the comments we've deleted in the past 48 hours have been from experienced Redditors, not new users (who have been very well behaved).

I know that, and they were there for a year, for example, this year to them would actually be several years to an observer here on earth.  When an observer is close to a lot of matter, or when it is moving at very high speeds (or both), time moves more slowly than it otherwise would.

Also, and we can calculate that it must have been expanding for 15 billion years from a central point.  I'm not exactly sure how they calculate the ""age"" of the Universe, but I think this is the 'jist' of it.

There seems to be some disagreement on the subject of whether Psychopathy is inborn or not, but received no consensus.  (ASPD, however, seems to be at least partially, if not fully, based on learned behaviour.)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, which blurs the line between psychopathy and ASPD, as explained above.",Psychology,False,,t5_2qm4e,psych,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1dzk17/does_the_average_psychopath_know_they_are_a/

I have the fan facing out. My thinking is that if the fan is facing in, it may end up pushing out some of the colder, leaving the hot air at the top fairly untouched. By putting the fan facing out, it's forcing the warmer air into the air conditioned room. IDK, it makes sense to me but I guess I can't articulate it.

Evolution as I understand it: Any favorable mutation

I hope that's right. My English is decent, more than the specifics of the example itself.

1) Development of new genus

How do minor, change its ""skin"" to survive in air and compete against an entire new world of predators. All of these changes would also have to be favorable to the organism as well. My brain tells me the likelihood of this happening, no matter the length of time, is so remote it seems negligible. 

2) Adaptation vs Evolution

Why do various different species, but their ancestors are all creatures which had the ability to see. Why/How did this trait (blindness) become favored, almost universally, over competing organisms who could see?

2.5) Adaptation vs Lamarckism

On the same thought as question 2. Has Lamarckism been proven false in long term scenarios. I understand use and disuse in a few generations not being observed

3) Can humans keep evolving? 

With our massive gene pool

with the headline that ""Europeans are all related"".  What does that
mean? Didn't we already know that?  And how can you show that the
Spanish and the Polish have the same ancestors only 1
but also see different effects of events from 1
genomes?  We're ready to talk about genetics
little bit of European history (Although note that we're not historians).

Here's a quick intro; there's more detail [here](http://gcbias.org/european-genealogy-faq/).

Few of us know our family histories more than a few generations back. It is therefore
easy to overlook the fact that we are all distant cousins
one another via a vast network of relationships. 

In the paper we use
genome-wide data from European individuals to investigate these
relationships over the past 3
of genome that are shared between pairs of individuals through their
inheritance from common genetic ancestors. We find evidence of
ubiquitous recent common ancestry
pairs of individuals from opposite ends of Europe share hundreds of
genetic common ancestors over this time period. 

Since the vast
majority of genealogical ancestors from 1
genetic ancestors
sample share nearly all of their genealogical ancestors only 1000
years ago (albeit to differing extents). Despite this degree of
commonality
Europeans
date roughly to the era of the Slavic and Hunnic expansions around
1
share with other populations lived longer than 2

Hi Reddit

So, and I just can't figure it out!!!!!! I have spent over a year and thousands of dollars. I am trying to make a small business, though now it is just a hobby because of this issue. 

I have a furnace that can reach 2100F or 1150C as a working temperature. I have kept the glass at that temperature for 12 hours

If I get the advice I need I will make something using this kiln

I have no clue why this doesn't work!!! annealing is no problem

Should I use a vacuum furnace? If so, what temperature does it need to be at and how long? or really if a vacuum furnace WOULD work?

I spent a lot of money on this. I first built 2 furnaces, was crazy expensive, but my still work for the 2nd process if the vacuum furnace works. 

Please help!

Edit: should also add that I do not use large pieces

Edit 2: not sure why i got a downvote

As our subreddit grows (56 thousand!)

A lot of people have noticed that the speculation levels around here are at an all-time high. 

* We'd like to remind folks that discussion should be centered around scientific answers to questions. Responses directly to the original post, and hopefully someone can help provide you some answers. If you're posting a response that attempts to answer a question, it should answer it scientifically. If you're an expert in the field, please say so, or get a panelist tag here to help identify you. If you're not an expert, that's okay too, but please provide citations from some source that is respected scientifically.  Also, especially in the top-level comments. 

Sometimes users who know about the subject might not be around. That doesn't mean it's ok to make something up. It's ok not to know, or you can point to a source that backs up what you're saying, post away!

* Another topic people bring up a lot is the subject of questions on AskScience.  Some folks feel they're too unscientific, for instance.  You should never take medical advice from the Internet.  

We're not quite sure why people downvote questions

'Scientific' isn't synonymous with 'every variable is controlled' nor does it have to mean 'requires a control group'. Science is a socially-engaged method of methodically exploring the world around us. How you define those words is a very personal thing, as evidenced by the wide variety of panelist tags in AskScience.  Many people (and many scientists!) have a very numbers/data driven view of science.  But we'd like to remind people that this isn't the only way that one can do science.  Scientists also use social methods (discourse, discussion, argument, peer review) in addition to their empirical methods.  One can be scientific and do naturalistic, theoretical, and/or qualitative research (i.e. not all science has numbers).

* **Extraordinary claims do require extraordinary evidence, some of the readers seem to disagree. That's one of the things that prompted this discussion of downvotes. Social science is science, as long as it's conducted scientifically. And those questions are welcomed and encouraged. Again, science is a very big tent, and it has lots of people doing amazing things that don't even occur to people outside their little niche. In other words, while evolution and cosmology are really interesting, so are a whole lot of other things. So ask that wild question! Look through the panelist tags to see what they're doing, ask them if they'll do an AskScience AMA. Do remember

If you see something in a thread that you don't think helps the community answer questions, because there are enough comments that no one could possibly look at them all.  Plus, it's anonymous, in case you're worried about that sort of thing!

Take notes, words (prose) are there to introduce, conclude. Practice. Practice. Practice. Understand the variables. Run the equations with the variables at 0, infinity, etc to find out what happens.

It seems that engineers suck at writing. I would humbly suggest that perhaps we should try to improve that in the engineering field.

If there are answers to some of these questions

* Does space experience stress and strain like conventional materials do? 

* Does it have a stiffness? Moreover, damper, multiple, or none of the above?

* Can you yield space -- if there was a mass large enough (like a black hole) and it eventually dissolved

On to my very ignorant question. We have evolved from apes (probably wrong here on some level, apes turned into humans and we got smarter - smart enough to create cities and planes and medicine and space ships. 

My question is this. Why have apes evolved into humans, intelligent life underwater that has evolved from dolphins or some sort of fish? Why do we not have intelligent life that can fly, evolved from birds? Is this something that could have once happened, and have since died off, or something that will happen soon, after we are all gone?

BugeyeContinuum majored in physics as undergrad, currently working on simulating spin chains, specifically looking at quenching/annealing and perhaps some adiabatic quantum computation. Also interested in quantum biology, doing some reading there and might look to work on that once present project is done.

mdreed majored in physics as an undergrad, and expects to either get a job or postdoc in the field of quantum information.

LuklearFusion did his undergrad in Mathematical Physics, if anyone is interested in that kind of thing. He is also not in a North American timezone, so don't get mad at him if he doesn't answer you right away.

Thanks for everyones help

**-**













While searching for rocks on my property to make a flower bed wall, while it does have some characteristics of being a meteorite, it also has a stronger chance of being more terrestrial in nature (I'll explain more below).

I did some research on meteorite identification and did some tests and have some numbers that may help.

I hope the sages at r/askscience can help offer some scientific input into my findings!

**Meteorite candidate 1:**

This was the first one I found. Immediately I was amazed at how heavy and dense the rock felt for it's size - it felt as if I was picking up a solid chunk of iron.

The rock was about 3/4 of the way buried and there was no evidence of a crater or indentation. Upon first inspection

**Size and weight:** 

Roughly 5 in x 4 in x 4 in (12.7 cm x 10.16 cm x 10.16 cm) with an approximate volume of 80 in^3 (1311 cm^3)

9.8 lbs (4.4 kg)
 
*Independent tests:*

**The Magnet test**

[Various magnets of different strengths \(from Neodymium rare earth to extremely weak fridge magnets\) stuck with great strength. 
](http://i.imgur.com/BqIrG.jpg)


**Approximate density test**

[As previously stated

Using a variety of mixing bowls and pitchers I had

In 3 seperate containers

Basic volume formula is mass/volume

4.4kg/25.4oz = 6.11 g/cm^3 

(doing 4.4 kg/ .75l gives you 5.86 g/cm^3)

So depending on what system of measurement you use the density falls between 5.8-6.1 g/cm^3

Now t[his chart illustrates common densities of meteorites](http://meteorites.wustl.edu/id/density.htm) - and it seems that there is a jump from stony-iron meteorites (in the 4s) to iron meteorites (which are in the 7-8s). 

These two charts give the specific gravity/density of many minerals.
[
Chart 1](http://www.reade.com/Particle_Briefings/spec_gra.html)

[Chart 2](http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_materials.htm)

And the closest match to what I have are Gallium

And to help rule out a man-made metal slag - iron ore slag is between 2-3 and hardened steel/iron is above 7.

** Meteorite Candidate 2 **

This rock may or may not be terrestrial in origin. It does display many of the same characteristics of the other rock (density, but it very well could also be an earth rock (although a very rare kind).

I live in Rhode Island, titanium, and olivine (as well as other minerals).

Now I have been to the mine

7.[ Image of mass](http://i.imgur.com/EiIuS.jpg) (interestingly enough the same mass as the other object)

This one did pass the magnet test as well (although I don't have an image for it)

And the density was:

(4.4 kg) / (5.25 US cups) = 3.54 g / m3

And the density of [Cumberlandite](http://www.francesjane.com/cumberlandite.html) is 3.82-3.88 g/m^3


So those are my rocks! If anyone here on [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) can help me ID them that would be great. 

Or if anyone knows of anywhere close to me that could do an analysis for me

Thanks!

• The thread following [madnote's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s6mob/i_am_swimming_in_a_pool_of_water_on_the_moon_how/c4bjs7h) explains that viscosity or ease of motion through the water is a major 

• The pressure differences are fairly negligible due to the fact that the Moon's gravity is only about ⅙ that of Earth. At the bottom of the swimming pool at 2.5 metres, I could dive down more like 30 m and be affected as much as going down  5 m on earth

**edit:** [bra-fitting guide](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/How-to_determine_bra_size)


Throwaway

**Question:**

There are women who can carry 15kg objects in their arms all day (taking frequent breaks) without experiencing back pain. However, they experience backaches in their lower and mid-spine within the hour. Why is this? Why do their backs not grow strong enough over time to support this weight? Also, how exactly does a bra redistribute force such that breasts no longer cause back pain?

Please don't brush this off as trolling; many people suffer severe medical problems as a result of poorly-supported breasts, experienced early-onset osteoarthritis of the spine, possibly due to very unsupportive bras--the very weight of her own breasts may have induced severe trauma/injury to the cartilage between her vertebrae. I am also a female with 2.5kg breasts, and am concerned about developing this condition.)

**Please make a comment to this thread to join our panel of scientists. (click the reply button) **

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are professional scientists (or plan on becoming one

You may want to join the panel if you:

* Are a research scientist

* Are able to write about your field at a layman's level as well as at a level comfortable to your colleagues and peers (depending on who's asking the question)

You're still reading? Excellent! Please reply to this thread with the following:

* Choose **one** general field from the side-bar. If you have multiple specialties

* State your specific field (neuropathology

* List your particular area of research (carbon nanotube dielectric properties

* Give us a synopsis of your education: have you been a post-doctoral research scientist for three decades

* Link us to one or two comments you've made in /r/AskScience, so we can more easily check if it's B.S. without specific domain knowledge.

We're not going to do background checks - we're just asking for Reddit's best behavior here. The information you provide will be used to compile a list of our panel members and what subject areas they'll be ""responsible"" for.

The reason I'm asking for comments to this post is that I'll get a little orange envelope from each of you

*Addendum:* Please don't give us too much of your personal details. We don't need it

&gt; * S
&gt; * M
&gt; * L

Further down on the wiki page it explains that in different animals with trichromatic colour vision

And if the process for television screens goes like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color#Examples)...
&gt; * Light source - Green (medium wavelength) light and red (long wavelength) light radiate from two different projectors.
&gt; * Projection screen - Both the green and the red light reflect off of a spot on the screen.
&gt; * Retina - The mixed light activates the M and L cones on a spot on the retina about equally.
&gt; * Brain - The brain interprets the equal amounts of M and L signal as yellow.

...then **does that mean that a trichromatic animal with a different combination of cones will see incorrect colours wherever there is colour mixing involved?**

If so

-----------------

**Edit and example:** Seems to be some confusion about what I mean by 'incorrect colours'  - say we have the intent of showing a TV screen that appears to be *yellow* - more specifically that to the person / animal viewing it will percieve it emitting light that *appears to be at 580nm wavelength*. So the TV screen turns on all red and all green pixels at full brightness

The math behind the way that combinations of different wavelengths of light are interpreted may be of use here.
