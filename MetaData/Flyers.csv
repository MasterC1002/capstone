I am a life long Devils fan, I thought we were going to have a longer series, and we would have to really step up our game.

To my surprise, dug in, stepped up and figured out how to take advantage of that, and they got the wins. Flyers did very little adapting after the second game it seemed. It just seemed like the Devils wanted it more.

You guys will still be a top team in the Atlantic next year, no denying.

Also

Cheers

P.S. Don't hate on Bryz. One mistake in game 5 was not the reason you guys lost. Check the shot counts and box scores for the series. Cut him a little slack.

Read - This kid can score. Him and Giroux will be a monster line for years to come.

Giroux - I hate to say it, or Hart in the next few years. 

Voracek - Those goals he scored against the Pens were great looking goals. He has a bright future.

Briere - When the playoffs come around you can count on him to score. He is money in the playoffs

B Schenn - I don't know much about him

Simmonds - Seems like a real stand up guy. I really like how when he came to Philly he embraced it as his new home so quickly.

Talbot - I fucking love this guy. Pittsburgh lost a great personality when he left for Philly. 

Couturier - Man

Knuble - I may hate this guy because he is a classic Penguin killer

Zolnierczyk - Dude has a really kickass last name. I love names that start with Z. It is such a great letter.

Fedotenko - He had some great years and was irreplaceable in the playoffs. 

Rinaldo - This kid can throw down when he needs to. 

Timonen - Probably the best Finnish Defenseman to play the game.

L Schenn - Great hitter. I mean

Grossmann - I think it's cute that when he was young they misspelled his name ""Grossman"" and he never bothered to correct it because he was shy.

Gustafsson - I think it's great that he came to America to play college hockey for a shot in the NHL

Coburn - Solid dependable D-man. Sometimes it is hard to find players like this.

Gervais - I read on Wikipedia that he is the childhood best friend of Talbot

Bryzgalov - Easily one of my favorite players in the league solely for his interviews. He is hysterical and no matter who he plays for I can't find it in me to hate him. 

Hartnell - During the lockout I gained a lot of respect for Hartnell. He organized a charity game so that fans could get a fix of the sport that they missed so much and he raised money for those affected by Sandy. I hate the dude on the ice

**tl;dr** Flyers need to put a string of winning streaks together

Obviously I would rather the Flyers be higher than an 8 seed


I looked at the past 8 NHL seasons to see how many points the 8th seed had heading into the playoffs and these were the results:


1. 2011-2012-   *Ottawa =* 92     *LA =* 95
1. 2010-2011-   *NYR =* 93         *Chicago =* 97
1. 2009-2010-   *Montreal =* 88   *Colorado =* 95
1. 2008-2009-   *Montreal =* 93   *Anaheim =* 91
1. 2007-2008-   *Boston =* 94     *Nashville =* 91
1. 2006-2007-   *NYI =* 92          *Calgary =* 96
1. 2005-2006-   *Tampa =* 92      *Edmonton =* 95
1. 2003-2004-   *NYI =* 91          *Nashville =* 91


Next thing I did was to figure out how to convert these results of a normal 82 game season into results for a condensed 48 game season. I did this by dividing 82 games by 48 games and got .5854. I then multiplied each 8th seed number by .5854 to find out how many points each team would have gotten in a 48 game season. These were the results:

* 88 points x .5854 = 51.5152 (Rounded to 52 points)
* 91 points x .5854 = 53.2714 (Rounded to 53 points)
* 92 points x .5854 = 53.8568 (Rounded to 54 points)
* 93 points x .5854 = 54.4422 (Rounded to 54 points)
* 94 points x .5854 = 55.0276 (Rounded to 55 points)
* 95 points x .5854 = 55.6130 (Rounded to 56 points)
* 96 points x .5854 = 56.1984 (Rounded to 56 points)
* 97 points x .5854 = 56.7838 (Rounded to 57 points)


So by using this formula, 4 teams would have ended with 56 points, and 1 team each would have ended 52 points, 55 points, and 57 points respectively. 


In the shortened 94-95 season the NY Rangers made the playoffs with 47 points out of the East, in the 93-94 season the Islanders made the playoffs with 84 points and the Sharks made the playoffs with 82 points. In the 95-96 season Tampa made the playoffs with 88 points and Winnipeg made the playoffs with 78 points. In the 96-97 season Montreal made the playoffs with 77 points and Chicago made the playoffs with 81 points.


In today's NHL it takes a lot more points for a team to secure a playoff spot

I got to experience G's first goal of the season, Bryz's stellar month of March

This was an amazing season for me. It's a shame it ended so badly at the hands of some some fat-ass goalie and an overpaid Russian has-been (I'm still bitter, reading through you guys' thoughts on the game, frantically checking twitter for line up changes. It's a shame it has to end this way, but hey, there's always next year. I have a really good feeling about next year. It's a feeling burning in my gut. We will take that Cup home soon. 

Lastly, and the many of you who comment on a regular basis on it. [I raise my stick to you all](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3ql71tEww1rsaq0to1_500.gif).

Ignore that he wanted to retire.  Ignore that he had the Flyers over a barrel because there's a shortage of good FA d-men.  Ignore that the Flyers are awful at landing FA d-men anyway.  Ignore our lack of prospects and weak defense.  Ignore all of these possible reasons for his ""inflated"" contract next season.

At 38, plays all areas of the ice, is 4th in the NHL among defensemen in points, and has been a shut-down defender.  (Irrelevant, but next year he's probably heading to his 5th Olympics, capping off 20 years of Olympic-level ice hockey.)  And he's apparently been doing all of this this season while [playing on a broken foot](http://www.csnphilly.com/hockey-philadelphia-flyers/kimmo-timonen-miss-final-three-games).

Sure, and I take everything Panatch says with several grains of salt.  But Kimmo is the poor man's Lidstrom and deserves recognition for that.

* Voracek blossomed.  We had hoped he could fill what we lost with Jagr
* Giroux had an off-year with a rotisserie at the left wing.  But he still ended up at a point-per-game.  He also didn't get maimed or traded yet
* The JVR-Schenn trade looks good.  Schenn has clearly become a top 4 defenseman
* Bryz played better than last year.  He'll look even better when we get some team defense (if we keep him).
* Mason looks to be competing for the top spot in net
* Hartnell looked to be finding more of a groove late
* Schenn and Coots, for a 21 year old 2nd line center, is a very good thing.  Couturier was quietly the best defensive center in the league at the age of 20, and looks to be able to contribute offensively as well.  In short: the Flyers have their centers for the next 5 years, if they want.
* Gus became a consistent NHL defenseman.  Still needs more experience
* Lauridsen looks to be able to contribute defensively as well
* Konan and Manning didn't look *too* out of place in the back either.
* That Akeson kid might earn another look.
* Timonen had a stellar year with one foot. 
* **edit:** As pointed out by /u/mooseflake, ""he really proved himself to be more than just a fighter, he caused a few PP's by instigating and angering the other players, plus his skills are definitely developing as a dump and chase style player.""  Thanks!
* **edit2:** As /u/kynx pointed out, it'd be nice to see him find his shooting touch again.

Also, knowledgeable community.  It's going to suck watching the playoffs from the outside, but at least it'll be good hockey, and we have the Worlds to watch.  Also, we'll probably see some trade-slinging from Holmgren, for better or for worse.  Continue being magnificent.  Go Flyers.",,self,28,

On Broadstreet Hockey's podcast last week, he played a lot with Grossmann, neither of which are gifted with the puck. This forced Coburn to play more offencively, which lead to more mistakes, and consequently, hate from the fans, which he doesn't deserve. 

Schenn and Timonen are a lock for one of the pairings, Coburn could become the incredibly effective defensive defenseman he was in the past again. With Streit (being an incredibly effective puck mover) on Coburn's pairing, he could sit back and concentrate on defense, which he's good at, rather than making that outlet pass to the forwards, which he's very bad at. 

**TL;DR** Don't trade Coburn. He not that bad. Play him with Streit and we play well and win Cup.

Can we all please simmer down about this? Expectations on Stolarz are soaring to unrealistic levels all of the sudden.

Here's the reality: the kid went from struggling on an unremarkable college squad, the man famous for getting the Caps to the ECF by having them lock down defensively and block everything. Not to mention their forward group is *pretty good.* They're consistently one of the best OHL clubs.

Stolarz got into a few games

I'm not saying the kid won't ever make the NHL

We should be happy if he's knocking on the door as a backup in 4-5 years. If - and that is an *enormous* if - he ever gets higher than that

Just my two cents. The kid's got some potential and I don't mean to say he WON'T be our goalie of the future,,False,self,t5_2ribt,1373140781.0,,True

Today was a bit of a different story, the shine of Pierre McGuire's freshly polished head, and a game against the Flyers arch-rivals caused tickets to go quickly and any second-hand tickets to go for a price that was out of my $120 budget.

Even though I couldn't get a ticket, I went to Xfinity Live to watch the game.  During the second intermission, I decided to run over to the box office and pick up my will-call tickets for the Penn State/Vermont hockey game.  On the way, I passed 50 to 100 people who were leaving the Flyers game.  There was still an entire period of hockey left to play, and people were LEAVING THE GAME.

I had come to terms with the fact that I didn't get a ticket merely because I didn't have enough money in the budget to cover a $150 ticket.  I accept the fact that it was a big game and tickets were in high demand

This post is not meant for anybody who is a true hockey fan.  This isn't even meant for the casual hockey fan (or a new hockey fan) who can appreciate a big game like this one and will actually go to the game and attempt to make some sense of it all.  But, who am I to stop you?  But PLEASE, do this during a game that isn't in such high demand.

I'd just like to take a minute to thank /u/Splo for making me a mod there earlier this week. I'm honoured to take on the task. With College kicking me in the ass recently, but I hope to add some more things as we go along. And, as always, Go Flyers!!

Back to today's game. Last night was a tough one to lose. Great start in the first period

Tonight, we need a turnaround, especially on the road. ",,False,self,t5_2ribt,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Flyers/comments/18n0ry/game_thread_flyers_771_canadiens_841/

**Points of Interest:**

Just in case you didn't realise

With G now wearing a big C on his chest

The other Schenn has been playing with Timonen all camp, minus the crazy, asshole-ish personality (which we all love, by the way). Keep an eye on him today. 

Bryz, he's figured out how to play in this City. I totally believe him, and if we can get the same results out of him that we did at the end of last season, he's worth every penny.

1376345901.0,1k8jmt,Flyers 13-14 Prospect Preview: Forwards,hawks27,33,2,17,"Last week was both the World Junior Evaluation Tournament and the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament

I wanted to take an in depth look at what to expect from the teams top forwards prospects and what to expect from them this year.

Listed alphabetically.

**JASON** **AKESON**

After a strong rookie year Akeson had a very good sophomore season that started in the ECHL and ended with his first goal in the NHL. Two of the biggest knocks against Akeson coming out of juniors was his defense and his lack of willingness to shoot the puck. Akeson took major strides in both areas (his goals per game average nearly doubled from his first to second season in the AHL). Akeson has a shot to make the team at training camp if Simon Gagne isn't brought back and he will probably be the first player called up if there is an injury (unless it's a Hartnell or Simmonds).

*Expectations*

A good season would see Akeson average a point per game in the AHL. Top prospects like Gustav Nyquist (slightly older) and Ryan Spooner (slightly younger) have similar size and talent and average around PPG.

**NICK** **COUSINS**

Cousins was one of the top 10 forwards in the CHL last season. He didn't get the hype as a lot of other players did because of his arrest led to the OHL and Hockey Canada acting like he didn't exist. In his limited time in the AHL his point production hasn't translated

*Expectations*

A good season for Cousins would see him scoring at the same rate as Akeson did in his rookie season (.72 PPG

**KYLE** **FLANAGAN**

Flanagan had an amazing year in the NCAA last season. He had the third highest PPG average behind Johnny Gaudreau and Erik Haula and they were playing on much better teams. Flanagan has also been consistent throughout his NCAA career

*Expectations*

Flanagan started his AHL career by getting 5 points in his first 5 games and ended last season with 7 points in 13 AHL games. For him to impact the Flyers future he will probably need to have a big season (he's only signed for one year). He could easily help other prospects like Petr Straka, but for him to make the leap to the Flyers he will need a Cory Conacher-esc season (slightly over a point per game).

**TYRELL** **GOULBOURNE**

Goulbourne was our controversial 3rd round pick this past season. Drafted to be a fighter and the heir apparent to Zac Rinaldo. In Rinaldo's draft eligible year he had 16 fights

*Expectations*

Leier took a major jump in his first post draft year

**SCOTT** **LAUGTON**

Laughton had a good year in the OHL, especially if Gagne doesn't re-sign, but I don't think that's the right move. Laughton could get a lot more developing offensively playing in Oshawa. Look at the teams that are great a developing talent, they don't bring players to the NHL when can play at that level, they bring them up when they can't gain anything from the level they are playing. Winnipeg rushed Alex Burmistrov and he struggled. He played a role, but it wasn't why he was drafted. They learned there lesson and left Mark Scheifele in juniors for two years.

*Expectations*

I think Laughton will play some with the Flyers this season. Laughton can play 9 games before he burns a year off his entry level contract. But I think he will get sent back to the OHL. If you look at his former teammate Boone Jenner progression in his second post draft year, elite prospects like Scheifele and Ryan Strome both scored around 1.75 points per game in the OHL in their second draft eligible year. 

**TAYLOR** **LEIER**

Leier took a big jump in his first post draft year. His point production nearly doubled and he was a valuable player on one of the best teams in the CHL. He's a grinder, but there is a chance that Leier could develop into a Max Talbot type player.

*Expectations*

I expect Leier to get over the point per game hump. His line mates from last year

**TYE** **MCGINN**

McGinn had a rather pedestrian start to last season, will rely a lot on who he is playing with. If he's playing with better players and he has chemistry with them he could put up great numbers. McGinn still hasn't scored at the same clip as similar players like Zack Kassian. The biggest issue for McGinn is that the Flyers also have Marcel Noebels in the system, who is a very similar and better all around player.

*Expectations*

He needs to score a lot and probably have to put up somewhere around PPG to get back to the Flyers in a power forward role. One thing that McGinn could do is develop into a goon. It's not crazy

**MARCEL** **NOEBELS**

Noebels had a very strong season in the minors last season. 13 goals and 23 points in 43 games might not sound great, he can play all three forward positions, and he is a strong defensive forward.

*Expectations*

If Noebels grows at the same rate McGinn did going from his rookie to sophomore seasons

**MICHAEL** **RAFFL**

Raffl had a great season leading Leksand to the championship in the Allsvenskan, and his point totals weren't inflated by playing with Lockout players who flooded the Allsvenskan.

*Expectations*

Raffl will likely be playing with the Phantoms this season

**PETR** **STRAKA**

Straka had a huge bounce back season last year in the QMJHL. He had 41 goals, a guy who shoots **a** **lot**. Get it on his stick and he gets it on net. It's something the Flyers could definitely use.

*Expectations*

Straka could have a monster season in the AHL. With playmaking centers like Akeson, and power forwards like McGinn and Noebels to bang in rebounds Straka could put up a lot of points. But Straka is still a gamble. He could revert back to how he played in 10-11 and 11-12. It could be feast or it could be famine. I believe in his skill and I think he's a lot mentally tougher than he was a few years ago, so I'm going to say feast.

**Second** **Tier** **Players** **to** **Watch**

Cousins former teammate **Brandon** **Alderson** might have to spend some time in the ECHL, if it doesn't he may have played his last game in the NHL.

**Other** **Players**

**Kris** **Newbury**, he put up good numbers (better than point per game) in the QMJHL and he scored consistently, but there is probably a reason he's signed to a minor league tryout contract. Some of **Rob** **Bordson** stats inspire hope, his explosion during his junior league in college and his dominance at the ECHL level, but he has yet to put up significant numbers in the AHL. It's never good for a player to be named Captain of an AHL team. Mostly because it means you don't figure in the organizations plans at the NHL level. **Ben** **Holmstrom** was named the Phantoms captain in 11-12. Now he signed a contract that pays him $285,000 AHL salary (only $15,000 less than Kris Newbury). Sorry Ben, this may be the end of the road for Brown.
