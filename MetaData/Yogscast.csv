You don't care what the audience thinks, the disabling of the comments section (Which I know was partly due to the impersonators) the Civ 5 series, the decrease in Minecraft content, etc.

The point is, playing what they want, saying what they want, and not listening to the 90% of their audience who have nothing good or constructive to say.

*EDIT* 

NOTE, something I'm sure many of you understand. However, apparently some people don't, so I'm just clearing that up for those particular people... political correctness man.. /le sigh

I've noticed that you guys have been getting a bit on edge or disintrested...Please don't lose what the Yogscast was founded on- fun. But other then that, editing, and whatever else you do to make your videos so good and high quality. Thanks for the hours and hours you spend making sure everything is crisp, clean, and beautiful. 
Keep up the amazing work :) -hug-

So I have thought of a way to bring them back- nobody said they have to be Simon and Lewis. As the yogscast family grows there are more and more people who could join in and make a Yogpod.

For example sips and sjin could make an episode
This would reduce the burden of the podcast on everyone yet still keep the fans happy! 

TL ; DR get other members of the yogscast to record Yogpods

The process took a long time because, and we went out of our way to ensure that the mods we chose have worked closely with the community for lengths of time.

We also wanted to ensure that, but even he needs a break every now and then. We'd also like to expand the use of /u/YOGSbot, and we can only have that work if there's a programmer onboard. It was still impossibly important to us that the people involved are a big part of the yogscast community, both inside and outside reddit.

I hope that and look forward to the new mods doing great things in the community. I also am happy to have met so many of you through your applications. You've renewed my faith in the yogscast fans and reddit as a whole.

I've had something on my chest for a while.  I don't much care for rumors or secondhand information.  It's messy, and people have the wrong ideas about stuff.

On the other hand

It's the same thing with secondhand information.  Just because you heard a guy who said he read on someone's blog, does not mean you need to repeat it, unless you have very solid information and know for a fact what is said is true and accurate.  People make up stuff all the time on the internet, and it's almost always bullshit.

For example, the map is deleted, some mods don't work anymore, they can't find actors for all the roles, the map got ruined somehow, they don't have a solid story, no one wants to do the series anymore, they can never work out scheduling

It's the same thing when people started the old rumor mill going when tekkit took a week or two week ""vacation"".  Some of the stuff people were saying ended up just being weird

What would be really amazing though, in a Star Trek/Mass Effect-esque fashion - to journey to the stars in search of adventure and planets made entirely out of pure Jaffatonium! It would also be quite easy to build a story into such a series, as the Yogscast are well-known for doing in previous series, with other yogscasters (sjin and sips? Rythian and Zoey?) building their own spaceships and striking forth to follow the good ship *Yogterprise* into the final frontier! *cue epic Star Trek intro music*

I don't know whether this would even be possible in Starmade (is it currently possible for more than one person to work on a single ship?)

Recently, a MCEdited straight line of Minecraft land filled with buildings, spawners, and other obstacles meant to stop you from obtaining the necessary blocks too easily.

This game form is a very popular tournament format in /r/mctourney. Recently

Basic Rules

1: No interacting directly with anything outside your lane - placing blocks or leaving it, as long as it is done from inside your lane.

2: Basic Minecraft Survival - No special game-rules (keepInventory

3: There must be an approved referee at each match. Currently only the /r/Yogscast modteam are approved referees. If you wish to be a referee

Here is a mock-up of what the Tournament timeline would look like -

Signups - Day 1 to Day 7

Round One - Day 8 to Day 15

Around 5 year's ago on July 19th 2008 the Yogscast released their first video [""Warcraft : How To: Kalecgos""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-GHnOtIGIY) now after 5 years they have become one of the biggest gaming channels on the website with over 5.5 million subscribers and are growing rapidly.  Many series have been made and many people have joined in to their group and have made the biggest grouped gaming YouTube channel. 

Great job /u/LewisXephos and /u/SimonHoneydew (I know you'll see this you stalker) and the rest of the Yogscast have a wonderful 5 year celebration! Hope to see much more wonderful content in the future.


Honestly I still can't believe it's been 5 year's and I wonder what they will upload tomorrow. Any way's I'm curious what are you going to do for the 5 year celebration? I'm personally going to start watching all the YogPoD's over again.

This sub's been up for over a year now, new games and new ways of bringing us quality entertainment. I think it would be nice if we reflected that change. 

As it stands

A couple of the most basic flair ideas would probably be:

* A face icon or at least something representative of each of the main 10 or so members of the Yogscast

* An icon for some of the more popular series (Garry's Mod, X-Com, Farming Sim, Chivalry etc.)

* Something representative of some of the major events (A bee or a goat for the livestreams

That form is live and updating

Some brief analysis:

* Men greatly outnumber women on this subreddit. This is probably exaggerated by the facts that (a) there are fewer female fans of the Yogscast and (b) there are fewer female people on Reddit. 
* Most of us appear to be in our late teens/early 20s. There are very few children here, contributing, and for following reddiquette.)
* As expected, though! (I apologize for any confusion regarding my Western/Eastern Europe distinction. I am not European and did not consider everything.) 
* Surprisingly, Sjin, Duncan, and Hannah. This is more or less in line with actual Youtube subscription numbers, so no real surprises there. 
* A number of people apparently subscribe to YOGSCAST Seagull.
* Twitter is the most popular medium for following the Yogscast outside of Youtube. I'd attribute this to Twitter being the place the Yogscast members are most active. Many people also follow the Yogpod
* Most of us were here before comments were disabled

We could make a multireddit called something like /r/yogscastreddits and then put in /r/yogscast, /r/sjin, /r/rythian, /r/thestrippin, /r/nilesy and any other yogscast members' subreddits.

We've both been trying to contact Martyn through various places, and her youtube comment on the video itself has become the target of some people refusing to believe she made the artwork.

To be clear though, simply that she be credited for her work. I'm sure as well that given the oppurtunity to create more thumbnails for Martyn, she'd love it!

Sadly, we will be homeless and we may have to move back to where my family is, which be a long trip and I know leaving behind everything she has will hurt my GF deeply, especially after the recent death of her mother.

Needless to say we are both battling with depression and anxiety right now (not to mention heat exhaustion on my part) and things feel pretty bleak. However, but hearing it from you really hit home. Something about the way you said it it sounded less like ""Well you know things will get better and you will be stronger for it"" and more like ""HEY! I know you can do this, I know how hard it is, I really do, but it will get better... I promise it will. Just hang in there for a little while longer, roll with the punches and when it is all over you will be much better for it.""

I just wanted to let you know that from where I am standing you have a special talent for making people feel better about them selves. Please never stop trying to help people

Oh and a side note (or 2, it always provides a good laugh.

Note 2: Please, which was a long ass time ago. I probably won't have the money to get it right away or the time to play it, so being able to watch you play the game I so desperately want would be amazing.
