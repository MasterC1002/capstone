The begining looks a bit bland
A nice jungle temple near the spawn with an easy skellies dungeon in a cave south of the temple's jungle hill make a nice spot for an initial house. I marked the spots of the near-surface dungeons (that I managed to locate) with red stars on the map

From the swamp, jungle, taiga, desert, other jungle, plains), all with interesting features, which is more awesome.
This large island has a nice village with forest and taiga nearby, with the most awesomestly cool valley opening towards the village where to build a mighty fortress naturally integrated into the landscape.

The mountain is really nice
And the valley, a waterfall, a natural archway exit, also has a surface dungeon! a completely closed skeletons dungeon just to the left after the first slope. No chests, but unlimited arrows, bonemeal and xp, right in the north tower of the inner courtyard
well, the compact group of five chunks you arrive to spawns slimes.

In the bay south of the village

Even the nether is interesting, you appear right under the walls of a large netherhold with everything you need. From under the mountain in the village island, there are netherholds within sight

Oh

I haven't yet explored the rest of this archipelago. I'm sure there are other interesting features

This is the coolest map I've ever played. It would be a great basis with few modifications for an adventure map, and import villagers to make succesful (iron-golem-generating) local themed colonies in each biome

You spawn on a small island with plenty of tall grass and one tree. next to it is another island with sugarcane, plenty of iron and coal, and 4 diamond ore in another ravine. This ravine is found through the mineshaft. The main attraction of this seed, however, is the mushroom islands. There is a big one next to the spawn island. You can't quite see it on the map, but it's visible from the island. There are a few smaller islands nearby, and maybe more I haven't found yet. Enjoy,,False,t3_19ymol

I took the time to excavate the mound of sand nearby and it happens to be sitting on enough sandstone to look like you're unearthing a pyramid. Careful when digging around though

""Linguistics""- spawn in the middle of a jungle.  Southeast of spawn is a very large lake surrounded by a VERY flat desert/plains area.  Right near the lake is a rather large village on a plateau.  There are some neat mountains/floating islands nearby.

http://imgur.com/a/3PVia (The second album has two pics I took after I made the first one)


The first pic is my spawn. Once I climbed the first mountain I knew that this seed was ""the one"". The glass you can see in the first pic is where I burrowed in for my first base. From there I dug a 3x3 shaft straight down to bedrock, which is convenient.

Yesterday I started on the skybridges connecting those three mountains. (I plan a nice minecart system) Today I built the house on the second mountain. The second album has some panoramas I took from the sky and from right in front of the lava pit. I've not even really explored the third mountain that I've connected with a skybridge
