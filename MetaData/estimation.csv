As it turns out, so on and so forth. Leaving a total of **52!** total combinations that need to be accounted for. This leaves us with an mind-crunching, intuition-shattering **8 x 10^67** decks of cards to make. 

This is going to take a lot of paper.

Let's assume the average mass of a deck of 52 standard paper playing cards is around **94g** (Wikipedia)


__________________________


Let's be generous here and assume that it's possible to turn 1 kg of raw tree into **0.5 kg** of paper

Assuming a reasonably sized tree weighs about a metric ton, we'll be taking up **7 x 10^63** square meters. 

Now to tackle the problem of actually holding all of these trees. A halo ringworld megastructure is truly a gargantuan feat of engineering. With a radius of around 10000 km and a width of around 100 km


__________________________

Each ring should grant us access to 10^4 x 10^3 x 10^2 x 10^3 x 2 x 3.14159 square meters of land

__________________________

Finally

If we pack each one of these bad boys together as close as they'll go without intersecting they'll take up a volume of around **10^70 m^3**. This would fill an empty cube with edges measuring some **twenty million light years** each.

**Edit 2:** [Another study

 with volume in mL, which is exactly our median value.**  It also moves two more answers inside a factor of 10.


----

We're trying out a new feature here on /r/Estimation.  Each week we'll post a [Fermi problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem) for you to try

----


**Rules:**
----

The key to making Fermi problems interesting is to *not* go looking up accurate numbers.  They're about making daring estimates and assumptions, whatever is in your brain already, and a calculator** (no fancy wolfram alpha shenanigans).

Obviously we can't enforce that rule very easily, rather than absolute accuracy.  This means you have to **show and explain your work** to demonstrate how clever you are.

Each thread will be in contest mode for 1 week

Feel free to PM me Fermi problem ideas.

I decided to use the distance from San Francisco to Washington DC as a base length of 3932km (from Wolfram Alpha). 

Then I took the average AU distance of the planets (ending at Neptune) as a percentage and converted that to km in the SF to DC distance. 

[Here is the spreadsheet I made](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkQOo4z8zMZpdEVUNTNJN3djZkNuckVFLTdNNUVFYmc&amp;usp=sharing)

Scaling the planets according to this ratio (also on [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkQOo4z8zMZpdEVUNTNJN3djZkNuckVFLTdNNUVFYmc&amp;usp=sharing)) unfortunately results in a 1, and a 4cm mercury.

**Fermi problem of the week rules:**

The key to making Fermi problems interesting is to *not* go looking up accurate numbers.  They're about making daring estimates and assumptions, whatever is in your brain already, and a calculator** (no fancy wolfram alpha shenanigans).

Obviously we can't enforce that rule very easily, rather than absolute accuracy.  This means you have to **show and explain your work** to demonstrate how clever you are.

Each thread will be in contest mode for 1 week

How much would it cost to make it look like we were orbiting Jupiter from the same distance the moon orbits the earth:

Well first off we have to figure out what it would look like if we dragged Jupiter as close to us where the nearest point *on its surface* is roughly as far from us as the moon is. I say roughly because the distance to the moon varies between 356, so we are going to use 400,000 km because it will mean we have to build a smaller Jupiter since it's at a slightly greater distance and because it's a nice round number. So first off, we want Jupiter's angular or apparent diameter not actual diameter at that distance, which will be different since it's a spherical object. We know the angular radius is going to be Sinx=r/(r+d) d being the distance to the surface of Jupiter (the same as the distance to the moon, or 400,000,000,000

Now nobody said we had to actually build it at that distance nor did they say we had to actually build it spherically, and because that's a good Low Earth Orbit height of about 400 km, another nice round number. Since we are building our fake Jupiter much closer, we don't need to build it with the same 70,000 km radius, just the same apparent or angular radius. Turns out our radius only needs to be 60 kilometers (Tan(8.57)=r/400,000) or 120 kilometers across.

Now we need to fly whatever material we are using into space, we would need only about 1,526 tonnes of aluminum (pi x 60,000^2 x 5 x 10^-8 x 2700 (kilograms per cubic meter of aluminum)) which on todays market, should only cost a bit over $2,855,000. Pretty hefty sum

SpaceX is currently responsible for getting cargo to the ISS and charges about $200,000 kilos, that's over **$300,000,000,000** to ship our giant aluminum disc into space.

Edit: Since support structures vary, let them sort that out. Plus the original posting actually suggested it be made out of paper. Wikipedia says the typical office paper has a weight of .08 kilos per meter squared. So pi x 60,000^2 x .08 should give us the mass in kilos. Turns out it would weigh 905,000 tonnes (yes I'm doing a lot of rounding), almost 600 times what the aluminum sheet would have weighed and would take almost 181,000,000, or 362, so hopefully we can get some kind of bulk freighting discount...",t5_2uh0h

A standard 30 mile per gallon highway car will use on average .239 cubic centimeters of gasoline to move 10 feet. 

This is enough gasoline to fill a sphere of radius 2.75 millimeters

Firstly, **spoilers** if you haven't seen the movie before. In 1978, Superman failed to save his girlfriend so he flies around the Earth fast enough to turn back time (somehow). The Earth's equatorial circumference is 40,075.017 km and Superman looks to be travelling around double that in a single revolution. Slowing the clip down, I counted the number of trips around the Earth that Superman makes during the 31 seconds shown on screen, and it turned out to be exactly 100. So (100 x 40075.017 x 2) / 31 = 258548.49677419357 km/s. This is around 930,774,356

If that power output was harnessed and put back into the power grid

Most power plants operate on par with hundreds of megawatts (Some are Gigawatts).  One Megawatt = 1, you have 1 MW.

Now comes the tough part - How many people are using exercise equipment (bikes, etc.) at any given time?  (I only use exercise equipment since those machines are most easily converted into electrical power.)   Of the more than 7 billion people on earth, could we estimate 1 in 1000 are using exercise equipment at any time?  I think that's too high.  How about 1 in 5000?

So I looked on my desk and saw one empty can of Coke. Upon examining the nutrition information

Now, dark (or semisweet) chocolate is made up largely of pure chocolate liquor (not to be confused with chocolate liqueur), which is largely made up of cocoa butter. So if I can assume those substances weigh approximately the same amount by volume, two litres (or 0.002 m^3 of dark chocolate) [would weigh 921.43 kg](http://www.aqua-calc.com/page/density-table/substance/Oil-coma-and-blank-cocoa-blank-butter) X .002 m^3 = 1.843 kg. Since 100 grams of dark chocolate has about 109 milligrams of caffeine ([for Ghiradelli, at least](http://www.energyfiend.com/caffeine-content/dark-chocolate)), two litres of it would have about **180 grams of caffeine**, far more than the mere fifth of a gram in a two litre of Coke.


TL;DR: Dark chocolate has way more caffeine by density than Coca-Cola does.

1370006472.0,1feha3,How many elephants make up the mass equivalent to a thimble-full of neutron star material [Solution],WhyAmINotStudying,19,8,0,"Someone in /r/askscience had posted [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1fdtzs/is_there_a_limit_to_how_small_a_star_can_be_if_so/ca9fnte) estimating that a thimblefull of neutron star material had the mass equivalent of 50 million elephants. I went through the process of estimation and found that it's actually over 2 billion elephants. I figured y'all would find this interesting:

 - Average density of a neutron star (p) - 5x10^17 kg/m^3
 - Average volume of a thimble (V) - 2.1x10^-5 m^3
 - Average mass of an elephant (m)- 5000 kg/elephant

Plug in a simple conversion equation:

 - pv/m
 - = [(5x10^17 kg/m^3 )(2.1x10^-5 m^3 )]/(5x10^3 kg/elephant)
 - = 2.1x10^9 elephants
 - = 2.1 Billion elephant masses per thimble-full of neutron star material.

The location here is mostly a twisting quarry road

In particular, but based on my own ability to pick up an object of roughly similar mass, I figured it takes him about 1s. It's not entirely clear how much of this he does beforehand, however, so I decided I would go with roughly a second initially. I've scanned through the footage, but I couldn't see any model number on the loader itself, which makes it difficult to know how long it is. However, so working from that I had a look around on [this website](www.ritchiespecs.com) for an example that seemed to fit. Unfortunately, when I looked at the footage in slow-motion, I can assume its height at 140cm. 130% of 140cm is 182; dividing that by 0.6 to get a figure for the overall height gave me 303cm.  

I went back to ritchiespecs to find a 3m tall front loader. I found that ~3.3m seemed to be a very common height for mid-range loaders, which would suggest a speed of 7.8m/s (~17mph) if the gun was picked up wholly while passing the loader. Since this seems unreasonably slow, I decided my time figure must be wrong; when I had watched the scene in slow-motion, I realised Bond had already gripped the gun and begun lifting it by the time the loader is reached, so I figured it only takes the cars about half a second to pass it, perhaps less. This suggests a speed of around 35-40mph for slower chases, which seems reasonable to me.



New to this sub, it would be awesome if someone with a gun to hand could try for a better estimate of how long he spends lifting it, since I suspect that's the biggest source of error in this.

* We want 10

* Only about 3% of our DNA separates humans from chimpanzees,000 human genomes and have just one or a handful of full human genome ""master copies"". Let's say 10.

* There are other cell biological differences besides just DNA, I assume that, if we can fit something as informationally-rich as an entire human genome into 1.5 GB, then this extra data is another small addition. Let's say equivalent to 10 individual genomes of data for each species.

* 8.7 million species on Earth


**The Calculation:**

So we have the data equivalent of about 20,030GB or 30.03TB. Multiply this by the number of species and we get 261.3 million TB.

I'm not sure if the human bipedal form would be dominant

So, types/bands of environments, workable symmetry axis, ways to move actuators, locomotion or rig sensoring methods etc. And space is very big, so many planets. But how do they relate?

I understand this will be extremely rough but I'm hoping on insight whether we'd see strong recurring themes or everything is pretty much very unique. Let's assume the working period the whole age of our galaxy up until now and use our current understanding of it's size and basic physics. We could limit it to just 'standard' planets and moons (no sun fieldliners or nebular beings).

Here goes!

Imagine a precipice with a void beneath.  Shuffling towards the precipice are people... a *lot* of people (and its this number we're estimating).  At the edge, only two of them have ever been saved... these two special people were plucked away at just the right moment by the only two people who could do it - me and their mother.

The mass of people are my potential children.  The two saved are my actual children.  If I'd never met their mother

So my question is, some percentage of those were able to have children with me... but none of them did.  And as a consequence all the possible children I could have had will now disappear over the edge into the void... total reality failure!

* The zombies have a bit less use of their muscles, so may push their bodies past the normal limits that a human might stop (for instance, they would keep trying to bite even to the point of breaking their own jaw). They also lack any fine motor skills, and while shots to certain parts of the body may remove or impair use of that part of the body, the only way to fully destroy them is by destroying the brain.

* The soldiers are trained military personnel

* If it matters, the sun is out but it's not too hot or humid.

* Reinforcements aren't coming. Outside assistance and contact are unavailable.

* Zombies become visible once they exit the forest which is ~250m away from the nearest stationed soldier. If the soldiers in the base are all facing to the north
