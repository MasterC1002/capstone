I've only scanned the article

&gt; A troll exploits social dynamics like computer hackers exploit security loopholes

&gt; It was this pattern,"" wrote one user in a post mourning his departure. Fans followed him wherever he went on the site.

&gt; As his fame grew, that he had adopted as Violentacrez's logo. He created a subreddit called Violentacrez, dedicated to news and posts about himself. Last year, the Daily Dot named him the most important Redditor of the year. Violentacrez was the most influential user of one of the most influential websites on the internet.

Chen goes on to talk about VA's relationship to the admins. Personally, I agree with the implicit suggestion that the admins opened themselves and the site to charges of complicity by dealing with VA directly.

&gt; Violentacrez's privileged position came from the fact that for years he had helped administrators deal with the massive seedy side of Reddit, who worked at Reddit from 2005 to the end of 2010. When Violentacrez first joined the site and started filling it with filth, administrators were wary and they often clashed. But eventually administrators and Violentacrez came to an uneasy truce, according to Slowe. For all his unpleasantness, they realized that Violentacrez was an excellent community moderator and could be counted on to keep the administrators abreast of any illegal content he came across.

&gt; ""Once we came to terms he was actually pretty helpful. He would come to us with things that we hadn't noticed

**EDIT** [A note from chromakode](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11ybyw/rmodtalks_officialunofficial_status_is_silencing/c6r9gs6?context=3)

This letter came into my modmail recently. As I was in [1] [1] /r/modtalk for over a year before being unaccountably removed last week

&gt; To Yishan Wong

&gt; We the undersigned submit this petition to demand that admission to online spaces where moderators are given special and regular attention from the Reddit administration be equitable.

&gt; Moderators of large communities are being denied access to important and necessary information relevant to their roles as a volunteer moderator on Reddit. These moderators overwhelmingly represent minority groups . They are having the ability to discuss and influence the development of Reddit blocked by other moderators who are not interested in having their dominant position challenged.

&gt; To solve the problem of this blatant marginalization, problems that extend to the Reddit userbase, we must ensure that all voices from Reddit communities, including minority ones, are treated equitably. As a first step, we demand that a minimum subreddit size for participation in [4] [2] /r/modtalk and #modtalk be established and adhered to, regardless of which community asks for entry. An initial recommendation could be having up to 10 representatives from each community of 15 000 or more.

&gt; As Reddit continues to grow

&gt; Sincerely

- Simplicity seems to be preferred.
- Interface elements should be distinguishable.
- The style should be recognizable.
- Green should stay and green should go (50/50 opinions wise).

Based on that we set out to improve on reddit's default style as basis. To still keep it in the meta sphere while recognizing the dislike for green we opted for a very toned down version of green that you see in the background and on a few other elements. 

What we came up with is a design that clearly divides several interface elements and shouldn't be to to busy to the eyes. Some highlights: 

- Look on your right
- Also on your right
- No more rounded corners
- Flairs have been updated to scream a bit less and just present the information 
- Much more.

I'm really excited about this project and I think /r/MetaHub provides a valuable service to those of us who are interested in meta discussion on this website.

Originally, they could find great meta discussions in the various other meta subreddits that already existed, or all across reddit really, and then crosspost them here. We are still gathering the best of them all in one place, but we are also encouraging users to go out and explore the full range of meta subreddits - from /r/newreddits to /r/banneddomains to /r/ideasfortheadmins. Self posts and meta discussion originating from /r/MetaHub itself were not part of the picture.

Recently, /r/TheoryOfReddit &amp; more) submitted a [self post discussing the recent VA controversy](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11e5hc/concerning_adrien_chens_expose_of_violentacrez/). I don't know when or why the self-post toggle was turned on, but I'm glad it was, because that was a great thread. One of the comments even got linked to /r/bestof, which [brought us some welcome exposure](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/11evfe/blackstar900_discusses_doxxing_adrian_chen_and/). Bs9k said he submitted it here [because he didn't think it fit quite well into /r/TheoryOfReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11e5hc/concerning_adrien_chens_expose_of_violentacrez/c6lr6cl?context=1). However, it wasn't within the original bounds of this subreddit, either... so I decided it was time to expand on those bounds.

You may (or may not) have noticed a new rule in the sidebar:

&gt;Discussion threads (self posts) may be submitted here if you think they might violate the rules in an existing meta reddit.

I'm hoping that /r/MetaHub can fill a void: meta discussion that would be *almost perfect* for one of the big meta reddits, or an idea about changing the fundamental nature of reddit, or any number of different topics.

I leave you with a reminder: This is a curated space, we know it's subjective, and yes, we like it that way. If you are worried about an influx of poor-quality posts as a result of this rule, please keep that in mind.

The premise is very simple. Take the format of /r/DepthHub, /r/IdeasForTheAdmins, /r/NewReddits, /r/ModClub, /r/ModNews, the list goes on. Submissions from any of these subreddits are encouraged, but meta discussion from anywhere on reddit is allowed. 

This subreddit will (hopefully) collect the best meta discussion into one place so you don't have to check 50 different subreddits - although if one were so inclined we do have a nifty [meta multireddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit+TheoryOfIdeas+TheoryOfLinks+TheoryOfModeration+CasualTheoryOfReddit+StatTheoryOfReddit+ShittyTheoryOfReddit+help+bugs+issues+adoptareddit+findareddit+multireddit+newreddits+subredditoftheday+weeklyreddit+csshelp+reddithax+redditdev+modclub+modhelp+modnews+nodtools+pimpmyreddit+redditrequest+modsoftherealms+collegemods+admin+announcements+blog+changelog+ideasfortheadmins+redditoroftheday+dailydot+subredditdrama+theredditor+circlebroke+historyofreddit+artshub+depthhub+methodhub+originalhub+religionhub+truedepthhub) in the sidebar under ""browse all"". I'm hoping to get at least one moderator from [the largest meta subreddits](http://redditdirectory.com/1989/Meta) involved with the project, it would be greatly appreciated.

The rules &amp; guidelines are simple:

1. Do not submit links to any site other than reddit.
2. Do not link to your own comments or submissions.
3. When linking to discussions
4. Please add ?context=x to the URL when linking to comment threads
5. External links may be submitted to the appropriate associated reddit.
