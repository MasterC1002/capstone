Simple, the more effecient output you get. Optimization peaks when there's a wikipedia link after //.

You C sharpees kill me to death. I think you find VB a little confusing so you pick C# the easier language. As far as I'm concerned VB is the more superior language whether it is in the hands of a real programmer or not. VB is not the straight jacket that C# tends to be. VB allows many more ways to skin a cat. Where C# may seem lean and agile it looses its flare and edge. I must contend that C# is not a language of a true artist but then true artists do use the thing. What I’m saying is that language is neutral in a common language infrastructure environment (.Net, unless you have to. I would always choose a VB background over C#, C++, java etc, and I won’t tell you why mister smarty pants. Lets be real, you are only building business applications. That is not rocket science or dare I say it, neither is it computer science. The phony elitism by these guys is beyond asinine and I will address who the real idiots are later. What I want to know is have you built any new technologies lately. Oops, VB, oh what ever. C# is not a new invention friends. C# is just a C

In the end VB and C# are just tools. The real intellect comes from choosing the one that suites you and the job best. The tools don't make the man

Sharpees also try to put on airs because they are able earn slightly better pay then Vebras (VB developers). I just love bursting this little Arian fable you guys like to spin about. As Yoda would say, there are far fewer C sharpees. If you intend to get one of the little buggers you will have to pay a premium. Do you remember PowerBuilder and SQL Gupta. Well that’s good because that’s all they are now, a memory. At one time they both commanded more than VB in the market place. So there you are my little grass hoppers. Those Idiots use the same dumb arguments you like to spread around today. Here is my Mr. T impression, “I pity the Fools”. It’s easy to hop on a bandwagon, the trick is being savvy enough to hop on the right one. VB is still here and they are not. There you go hot shots, so you can stop clicking your boots and saluting Hi-Hitler. If sharpees had any real sense they would just shut the hell up. Why would you want more people to start using your language and bring down your stock (A.KA your earning power). Just shut the hell up. Only an Idiot would bandy such nonsense.

I hope I have offended someone

Oh and why do I call C# users C sharpees? The language and the name (C#) remind me of that little ugly dog.

Anyway we have much bigger fish to fry in the near future so it won't matter if you are a vb, c#, blah, blah, Blah.

If you really want to know what the elite is all about I guarantee you won’t find it in C#. If you really want to broaden your horizons you better find out what Linux and Mono is all about. You sharpees don’t even know you are just slaves. Common Language Infrastructure under Linux will set you free. I’m sure most of you want to be elites are scratching your heads now so I will rap this up because I have wasted enough time with you chaps. You now have real elite knowledge. Off course if you where elite as sharpees like to pretend then this thrashing would not have been necessary. In any case we all want to be the best that we can be. I just shared the path with you. You have ability to be much more than just programmers and developers. You should strive to be Computer Scientists. That is what the world needs.

    int main ()
    {
    	const char *message = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(""%s""
    	return 0;
    }

The first thing we can do is remove the ""const"" qualifier on the char pointer

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main ()
    {
    	char *message = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(""%s""
    	return 0;
    }

Next we can simplify the printf statement. You really don't need to feed it as explicitly a string. You can use printf(message);! This won't open up any vulnerabilities either

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main ()
    {
    	char *message = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(message);
    	return 0;
    }

Finally

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main ()
    {
    	char *m = ""Hello world!\n"";
    	printf(m);
    	return 0;
    }

And there it is! Code that does the same thing but with a much smaller code size! It's more clear,,False,self,t5_2u9xe,False,,True

Names like ""anna"" are very bad passwords. There are programs which can crack those passwords really fast

Next thing is: Don't use consecutive numbers like ""12345"". Every cracking program can count to 5. But you can make it harder for them if you do something like ""12435"". That will completely confuse them

Always choose a long password! For example the password ""2inches"" would be too short. ""30inches"" is much safer!

Don't use any special characters. This will only make your password stand out from the crowd and attract password crackers.

I also have a secret protip from my co-worker. He said i should use ""xe$8a+iph5k;oxah)Xuch"" as a password
I'm sharing it here so you can all use this password too and be super secure!

Do you guys have any other tips for me?

And if you're application is too big for a webapp? Then Java is probably too slow to be worth it anyways. 

Java is full of security holes, and cross platform programming can be done in other languages more efficiently and much more cleanly (also slightly subjective). 

My question to you

We have languages like Python, CommonLisp etc, that make Java look slower than Windows 95 and have 10x the readability. If you use Java, speak up, why do you use it? Could you use something else?
