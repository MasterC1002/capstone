I've never tried any drugs except weed and alcohol so I was kind of nervous before shrooms and was even afraid I'd trigger a mental disease or freak out on a bad trip because usually I'm a really nervy and introspective person

Nonetheless

Right after I finished my meal I got excited and was ""feeling it"" even though it was probably placebo effect because shrooms take time to kick in.

45 minutes later
I didn't get visual hallucinations or classic ""trippy"" stuff...everything just felt normal. I felt sober. It felt like this is what life's supposed to be. I swear on everything that exists in this world

What is being able to fully control your emotions? I know. I'm enlightened. I was so positive and happy

Also I gained this magical ability to see myself from other people's perspective. Usually when I'm sober/on weed/alcohol I tend to get a bit carried off and I give off a creepy/weird guy vibe. On shrooms, myself and...

fuck.

I can't ramble on any more. Long story short

Shrooms gave me confidence I will carry with me for all my life and for that I thank them. They showed me who I really was. And I love myself.

it's a little hazy but i still recall the more important aspects of the night. I didn't have much money or any plans for the evening, and then made the tea. I sat down on my friend's couch and waited for the effects to start.

about a half hour in, getting ready to pregame and go to some shit ass kegger. they packed up some bongs, i ripped em, and then it was done. 

next thing i know i'm laying in the bathroom, maybe 15 min, it felt like an eternity. complete loss of ego. i became everything. it was ineffable. merging with the universe. 

after laying there long enough to come down i looked at my puke and saw thousands of faces in it. the puke was breathing at me, my parents meeting, every choice that anybody had ever made) and i was sitting there looking at my hands was too much for me to handle. i laughed. i was laughing hysterically for probably 15 min, looking at my hands. the cumulative point of everything was that moment. it was awe-inspiring.

I've done a lot of drugs in my younger years, and two 1mg clonazepam (my Rx but don't take often). It was a rainy day.

11:30am: I cut up 9 grams (dry) of P. cubensis into tiny pieces, but otherwise an empty stomach. I followed the cubensis with a pint of fresh blueberries, to settle my stomach, and get a little vitamin C. I'm prone to nausea, but was pleasantly relieved my ingestion method seems to minimize this, and only lasted the first hour.

During the first 1.5 hours, I've developed a skill at masking inebriation. When I realized this was going to interfere with my goals, I took 1mg clonazepam and locked myself in the bathroom to be alone and let things progress. I remember lots of yawning for some reason.

1-2:00pm: In the bathroom, and started... detaching? I knew I wanted to do this on a rainy day, but had no idea how important this was. All of life was revealed. Words really don't do anything to describe this process. I didn't have visuals per say, more of visions. I saw my body becoming spores, bodies growing out of my ethereal being. I ceased being, Ego was abandoned. The mushroom became me. On a cellular level, I understood everything I reached a state of rapture and ecstasy. There were waves of glory passing through my body, giddy

2:00pm: I set up the bedroom ahead of time, grunting, and rolling around on the bed. There were a lot of body secretions (mucous, tears, coughing up phlegm, and ovulating too) there was fluid everywhere. I've always been connected to the earth and am a biologist, and my experience today confirmed everything I already knew. I felt earth and life passing through the center of my body, but it was not sexual in any way. Just complete oneness with life on a basic and cellular level. This is not the best description

3:45pm: Started to regain composure. Still very euphoric and giddy, I was covered in snot and all manner of body fluids, and we went out for burritos at 5pm.

6:00pm: Came home and slept hard. I am usually an extremely light sleeper, most likely from dehydration. My body is sore, my throat is harsh from howling and indiscernible vocalizations of earlier. Going back to bed soon.

I feel a clarity of being I haven't felt since childhood. Under proper supervision

Be safe

EDIT: The experience was very detoxing. The amount of mucous and tears my body expelled had a physical detoxification aspect to it, I am a scientist and an atheist, but don't discount that I was tapping into some very ancient knowledge. This experience was completely positive in every way. I have a deep respect for all entheogens, and am very happy I finally was able to access this one.

(6:00 PM) I only took about 2.0 grams (a little over half an 1/8) and discovered that I also was very sensitive to them. I ground the 2.0 grams of dried mushrooms up and mixed them with a drink and downed the whole drink at once and then waited for the visuals. I never got nauseated or anything

(6:30 PM) It started just with seeing halos of light around the ceiling lights

(6:45 PM) For the first time in a decade I felt truly happy. Everything was okay

It was

I understood all of my problems and was able to discard them

(7:00 PM) I saw mild hallucinations as well as the normal patterns (patterns forming people looming over me

The walls and the ceiling were breathing but if I made myself focus on them they turned into rolling dunes of sand and I would lose time watching a desert landscape shifting like on fast-forward.

(7:30 PM) I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror (again against advice

The bathroom curtain patterns turned into people trapped in the black swirls

(7:40 PM) I took a bubble bath because it sounded amazing and lost time watching the bubbles swirl and slither up my arms and legs and breasts. None of this was scary

(8:30 PM) I got out some fabric paint (we had a sheet hung up on the wall as a sort of group art project) and went to work

(9:00 PM) As I was winding down I just lounged naked (lace patterns on my skin!) in my computer chair

After a few tries, through the walls I could see hulking tentacle creatures reaching up to the sky, all made of advanced machinery and coexisting with life outside. It was all very ""War of the Worlds"" or something.

(10:40 PM) I hoped the vision wouldn't fade but eventually it did and I was left with a few basic patterns before I eventually fell asleep at the end of the trip. I woke up the next morning feeling well-rested with no negative effects.

Overall it was an extremely positive experience for me

When I first did shrooms, because on acid I found music to be much more beautiful and peaceful, but with shrooms it was just a matter of the beat taking over my body. The anxiety was gone, at least for the time being.

Riding in the car to the park the anxious feeling came back. I related heavily to a dog. I was just so excited to get to walk through nature to a dock and just look out at the stars. I had all this energy, but again the music just took over me. Dancing and bobbing my head was a good outlet for my energy until we got there, and I could run free in the parking lot.

We walked through a forest on the way to the dock. Everything my friends said was clever and funny. And at times the shrooms gave me a quick sense of wit that I didn't even know I had. Like they had a sense of humor of their own. We were doing weird voices, and just at peace with everything. I did not feel the same empathy that I had with acid, but rather, just an overwhelming sense of okayness with the universe. I felt emotionally close with trees and rocks and grass, and even mud. Nature not only looked more beautiful, but it FELT more beautiful. I just knew everything was exactly as it was supposed to be. Looking at the stars was nice, but really just enjoyed laughing and having a good time with my friends in the end.

The come down was much rougher than acid. I felt sleepy, which was nice.

The other couple of times I did mushrooms I went hiking up a mountain. My dose was higher, and this warm joyous feeling about everything. Again, less empathy. I didn't find myself wondering about people and their lives, but rather just trying to be happy around them in the brief moment we shared. I drank out of a river, climbed rocks, and went off the trail into the bush to find good spots to smoke a joint with my friends. 

In the end, nausea, etc) is very nice. And I wish shrooms lasted as long as acid. But mushrooms are just so playful and happy. I love to walk and run and climb. I love nature. The high from mushrooms just feels so much more primal and natural. Acid is a very thinky feely drug. And I still enjoy it, but it just doesn't have the same humor and free spirited feeling that only shrooms have given me.

I'm in my 30's and had never tripped.  I'd ingested mushrooms before, and it was spectacular.

I ate a little more than 1/8th, but obviously not delicious either.

It took a long time to take effect, but much much better and much more intense.  I felt like I was being hugged by the cosmos, but at this point the euphoria was completely physical.

Maybe 20 minutes later I started to get some visuals.  The blinds were moving, it was not subtle but not threatening.  I kept moving jackets away from me on the couch because they seemed like they were trying to get into my personal space.  My friend and I kept jumping up to examine the blinds to see if they were really moving or not, at one point we employed a ruler.  

I wrote some shit down on my phone when I was in the apartment.  Far from profound

**The couch is breathing moving im typing but my thumbs don't feel like mine.  my body is a shell and I want to break out of it.  this is a lot of fun but not transcendental.  i want to go out and see people.  I am friends with all the lights.**

This was when the mental euphoria kicked in, and everything about the world.  

Everyone had warned me not to go out to bars, so I goaded my friend into walking to a bar.  We would have just enjoyed nature outside but it was cold as fuck so that wasn't in the cards.  It was a bar or the apartment.

Shit got WEIRD in the bar, but I was enjoying their presence and the human energy around me, all the good times.  I felt like I was a part of their good times even though I was just an observer.

We go to another bar to meet with his girlfriend and some of her friends.  At some point while we're at this bar, and then I leave.  I didn't flee in terror, I just knew it was time to go somewhere else.

I walk by myself to a third bar and meet a friend from work and his gf. At this point the visuals made everything look like a fisheye lens, bought me a beer, remarked how it was cool that I was holding my shit together in such a loud/chaotic environment, etc.  

The crowd starts to get to me and I just walk away after what felt like 15 minutes but was probably 2 minutes.  Later on I felt really bad about leaving the beer behind.  I found a girl I'm friends with in the same bar, a little queasy, but not unhappy.

I finally drove home and despite tons of yawning


I did not experience any sort of ego-death or self analysis

 My friend Tristan and I both had an eighth and we ate half on top of some pizza. Tristan has an iron stomach, and real, and being grounded in ""reality"" vs. what doors were about to be opened. 
 
 When my mind finally gave in

 After the music was chosen, we felt safe. After about 45min to an hour into the trip, we decided to finish the other halves of our eighths. Words cannot describe how annoying eating was. It became the biggest chore I have ever experienced. Tristan looked like a rabid dog eating his, I'm sure I wasn't much better. Here is where our tard wrangler came into play of having to wipe our mouths and clean us up. 

After eating, questioning everything from pain, to cancer. Tristan then became very quiet and started to self reflect. 

I had already started this by staring into the clouds. The clouds were the most amazing and awe inspiring thing I can recall. The ends of them looked like fire that were twirling and morphing into various shapes. The world seemed like I was watching a 3D movie. My depth of field was completely expanded. As I stared into the sky

 I immediately became so appreciative of everyone around me and in my life. My girlfriend has often got on my case because I will often do things for the sake of other people that I personally don't want to do. This trip kind of made me realize that, and like I genuinely want to be with them. Not make them feel like an obligation. I instantly became confident in my life choices, and my choice to move away. That without this move, my life would be a dead standstill, and never allow me to grow up.

       Just wanted to write out a trip report after the best time

   I cant say that I'm an 'experienced' psychonaut
   
   This was the largest amount I've ever done

    and it was... incredible.

   
  It ripped me apart in the best way possible. I won't lie, but I had this vibration going through my lower back and arms that would NOT let up (and I mean the entire time, maybe for 4 hours?)

  We started riding this wave
I told her it was okay to cry

  Everything was so goddamn beautiful. Me, our entire lives, just felt like I could see everything for the miracle that it really is. It was INCREDIBLY emotional. 
The most emotional trip I've ever had by far. I felt things that there aren't even words for. 
   WAY TOO powerful. Words were feeble. But here I am

We were feeling this huge rush, she was finishing mine, we got it. we totally got it. We both saw these awesome patterns in her clothes, and we were seeing the same exact thing. Aztec symbols, woven into her clothes. Blew our minds that we'd both see that at the same time. 

Everything looked like it had moving algae on it. It was really beautiful

Then
    That a nuclear bomb had gone off in the sky
    That was the only way something could be that bright. 
    She pulled the shade

   Played coldplays dvd again. Wished we could do that 24/7. realized we could.

We walked into thte kitchen because she asked if I'd like to splash water on my face.
She's always thinking like that.
So I slashed a decent amount of water all over my face and arms. Felt crazy. Like I was wearing a type of armor

So another stronger wave comes along and I get really energetic. I was pacing back and forth talking about how we worry about too many silly things

  And then I realized
And I realized nothing in my life is by force. Not one thing. 

It just felt so... freeing. Like

Everything is going to be okay. We're going to be great. Amazing in fact.

I was filling up with this energy now. It was pooling inside of my body, eyes. I jsut wanted to EXPLODE, to let ti all out, and I didn't know how.   And that's when I realized thats why I love being a musician so much.


   **TLDR; Cried from beauty, realized everything is choice, that we're going to be great, and why I love my music so much.

It was a sunny summer day, good relaxing setting.  Me and 2 other friends(W and R) each took about half an eighth each, i took a bit more since my friends didnt want to finish their stems.  We were at another one of our friends houses(H),  which is on the water and has a nice big grass lawn.  We took the shrooms around 11ish, and the started to hit us around 11 30-40ish.  (We are smoking weed the entire time)

Now, so this was not suprising.  He had an amazing trip and just seemed loopy the whole time.  It was R's first time, and he was just out of it.  He seemed calm, and everything went smoothly.  

Unfortunately for me tho, and I had assumed I would not be headed towards this party till 6ish.  Around 1 30ish, i received a text(I dont really have trouble with technology while tripping, the only thing that bugs me about my phone is how i subconiously continue to check it even though I have no need to) saying that my ride was leaving for the party at 3ish, and that i should head over around 2.  At this point, I was just like welllllll fuuuck.  To make matters worse, after a long morning in the sun, but I didnt notice since i was tripping. I started to feel horrible, and laid down in the shade.  After a good half an hour of calming myself down

So its around 2, aka the point where you forget you are fucked up. I get a ride to where my carpool is supposed to be at, only to find out they really had no intention of leaving soon at all, they just wanted me to hang with them.  At this point, ive become very quiet.  I just wanted my trip to be over with so I could just go back to life.  It wasnt too bad fortunetly so I still enjoyed my trip.  After staying with these new friends for a while, they decide to go to subway.  Im still tripping, so this was a VERY VERY weird experience.

Once we sat down with our food, and for that i'm sorry, Its hard :(

Eventually we went on our way

Other trippy thoughts which occured to me that day is how fucking weird cars are.  When i smoked weed i still trip over the idea of cars, and I get a little of the trippy nasuea feeling if i get high then start to think about cars.  I am very suprised with how much of an impact that this one thought has had.


TLDR: I took shrooms, and I can no longer look at cars the same

After I ate an amount of shrooms somewhere between 2 to 4 grams (had to eyeball the dose because I didn't have a scale) on an empty stomach, it felt like every word I said to Joe came out forced and awkward. I realized that I was just filling the silent gaps in conversation with pointless blabbering. This thought caused me some discomfort and I felt self-conscious about my every word. That feeling, in addition to the nausea getting stronger led me to thinking that I wasn't ready for this trip and I also felt like my sanity was slipping.

At that point my memory starts blurring but I remember jumping from thought to thought intensely and quickly. It felt like I was going crazy and at one point I thought that nothing I was seeing was real. I tried reminding myself over and over that I ate mushrooms and this is just temporary

My next thought was the idea of letting go, no more uneasiness. It felt like my body blended with the ground and I couldn't separate it in my mind unless I moved. Honestly, even though I had let go and started feeling a positive experience, my mind was too fucky to remember a lot of things during the peak. I was lying down eyes closed during the entire peak.

The rest of the trip and comedown was incredible. I just felt accepting of every moment in time and content without changing anything. It was like seeing everything for the first time.

The shrooms really started doing work about 2/3 of the way to the top of the trail, giving us a sick view of the Gorge. The rock was surrounded by pines on all other sides and covered in lichen. I have to go into detail because every little thing came to life later.

Okay so we all have that general sense of ""oneness"" when we trip and we all see things dance and breathe. Well, and every time he did, it amplified both of our visuals. Eventually we started to feel a lot of energy throughout and all over our bodies. I eventually sat down and couldn't move, and my feet and hands began to vibrate and burn with energy, it was traveling from the ground to my foot, then into me, where I could channel it wherever I wanted. 

Alright

The sense of overwhelming energy and euphoria just became unbearable for a while. My roommate started looking at me funny, and we both had a sense that it was everywhere, you know, like a thing you can share with anyone. Well, that sense of love started to mingle with a sense of bliss and pleasure. For a long time, without touching one another, we were essentially having spiritual sex. Now I'm being totally serious when I say that this was all impossible to avoid. We're both men and were pretty certain of our sexuality before all this. It just overcame us both. I guess this is what some folks mean when they talk about an Earth Goddess. We sort of had to give in or otherwise vomit, the more we seemed to become ""one with the earth"" and lose our ego. Then shit got even weirder.

There were bugs everywhere, as if we'd repelled them. I remember everything kind of had this dismal, sinking feeling for a while, then we came back up and the sense of bliss started to get wild again (this happened over and over, like a roller coaster (hmm...or a wavelength?). After a while (time was irrelevant but that's past the point) the ants did come back, but only whenever we were having a really intense moment. We discovered all these ways we could amplify our energy, harness it from the earth, it's as if the bugs were all over us, ants everywhere --- wooosh
	Then we started having all these epiphanies together. This, communicating totally telepathically, literally just using the Earth to communicate. It was all feeling most of the time, no words. It was truly fucking mystical, like I can't discredit this at all. So there was the first epiphany --- human beings can do this kind of shit.

Then the next epiphany came: We, everything is a vibration, a frequency. Tesla was tapping into the frequency of the Earth to harness energy. We were doing the same, but with our bodies. And by tapping into that at the same time, we were both resonating it, becoming the same frequency.

Then came the big one. Oh man this one really hurts my brain

We are all reflections of one another. We are the Earth, it creates life, because life is the Earth. Now that human beings are so advanced, the Earth has essentially evolved that level of consciousness just the same, and it's a collective consciousness. Now think of this for a moment. That means that the ego, sexuality, race, like polyps on coral. Just another frequency

All of these thoughts were flying back and forth between me and my buddy, we stopped thinking, even the wind stopped. We had just tapped into the Earth consciousness. 

We were first shocked, and the same goes for every being that ever lived or will live. Reflections, all existing at once in space-time. We knew that (well, we thought it, since talking wasn't even necessary at this point) if we were to fling ourselves off of the cliff, we would immediately re-enter existence through an alternate version of ourselves, chiseled up by a new environment, and because of that a unique ego. 

But that is why you cannot think someone else's thoughts (when you're not tripping balls

I am you, and we are the Earth. That, my friends, is what my friend and I tapped into that day. By tapping into the frequency of the Earth, we could see past our egos, and acknowledged all of the people we had once been, still are. We were both masculine and feminine at the same time. Suddenly Adam and Eve made perfect sense. It's the story of chaos versus structure, ever since life began. Time

After the initial craze of bellowing into the wind, we finally entered a perfectly bliss state. We had no doubt that every enlightened being that ever lived must have went through this. We looked out into the Gorge, feeling like Gods, much larger than the space suits of flesh and bone that grounded us there. Through us, the Earth had come up and peaked out, examined itself and all its progress, looked in the mirror for a moment. We knew we had done this many times before, the god within us all. We were truly living ""in the moment"", is the ultimate

Now that I've made my point on the ""I"" and ""we"" thing

Every god, I created them all, changed the story, forgot things, remembered things, wrote it down, burned the libraries, every plant

I am having a very hard time returning to reality after what I have experienced. My roommate and I are obviously going to have to face what happened with this spirit sex thing, crossing paths with us. Weirdest shit ever. We made a connection with those people and became part of their pack as we ascended the mountain, it was eerie how easily we did that.

The whole day was full of strange things. As the sun was going down we were a bit lost in the woods and thought we'd have to sleep out there, I, was still guiding me. Fuck this is so hard to comprehend or explain. That night I got a text from my schizophrenic friend, knew it was him before even looking at the phone. The list never ends.

So I guess my question in summary is this: How the fuck do I keep from going insane after this? ",self,t5_2qszq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/11xayx/magic_mushroom_trip_ended_with_me_questioning_my/

The difference between half an 1/8th and a full 1/8th is pretty big. But the difference between an 1/8th and 2/8ths is mind boggling. I understand how it would be very easy to go insane on that many. I would like to think I handled it well

Anybody who is thinking about taking this many mushrooms should do so with caution. It is very hard to control yourself when you look at your buddy and he has 10 eyes.

Also make sure you stay hydrated and eat food. We went to the beach as the trip was winding down and one of my friends

Like, and it’s those things that make us who we are. But what is at the core? What is everything built off of? What’s inside?

nothing.

There isn’t anything inside. Not really. 

All we are is these little discrete experiences, all bundled together in a consciousness. We’re held together, in this physical body. This form. But at the core, it’s just bound together in its own tangled web. It’s not wrapped around anything. It’s suspended in nothingness. A vacuum. Everyone has a vacuum inside of them, and they just don’t see it or feel it or know it because we’re all so occupied by what’s floating around in our head all the time. 

We are built around emptiness

So what does that mean?

I’m not quite sure. Everything we are is just shards of existence, that’s being suspended by giant pylons, and cables, except when you finally walk to the ends you find out there’s nothing there. Or being in a giant steel tower, with beams extending in all directions, tangled and drilled together with bolts and screws for miles and miles. And you climb down this colossus, down into the dark, there’s nothing. It’s stray steel beams, if you started by making an assumption and then got to the point in the proof where the assumption didn’t need to exist. You’ve built up this massive thing based off a common point

And the truth of it all is, except death, I suppose, but no one is proposing that). And you are alone in your tangled empty prison, you have to face yourself every single moment of every single day of your entire existence alone. Because what other people see, it’s not you. Seeing you from the outside is like seeing a shadow of the truth. A photo of a painting of a sculpture of the truth. It’s a part of you, an angle, just certain details. No one really knows the storm of thoughts flowing in you constantly. Every conversation, true ideas in your mind. The same topics, one part

And even then. They’re just shells. Hollow earths formed around a nonexistent nexus of gravity, ever solid ever stoic earth. 

But that’s the best there is.

That’s the best we’ve got.

And that’s okay.

Because at the end of the day

better to be a manipulator than to be the one manipulated
but the manipulator in reality creates the manipulated\

even justifies itself as explaining it in terms of people needing to be 
governed
why must we govern?
and to what end?
i want to live in a world where i don't have to worry about someone stabbing 
me in the back
i want to live free of paranoia
such petty trivial things
i want to live in a world where equality is not an illusion but reality
where the resources are available to all who seek them
where the manipulator is not the best rewarded of beings
as an artist
into something pleasing
something comfortable
not frightening like the world can sometimes be.
i want to be free from being recognized as an individual crafter
rather be part of a chain that sought similar results.
call it what you will
brotherhood, there is something inherently present
in the fabric of existence which connects us all.
no one should seek to profit from seeing this truth.
all avenues of truths should be made available for all regardless of 
where you come from.
words are frivolous. they complicate the matter because they are so often misinterpreted.
so often themselves manipulated into justifications for the individual who is 
on a path he does not understand and seeks to  comfort or ease his suffering.
it is a catch 22. 
that is the truth. and when the thing realizes that it is chasing its own tail
it may laugh
lash out...
but regardless of what or how it reacts
and we must treat it with respect.
why?
because that is the whole truth. it is unraveling itself. continuously 
chasing its own tail. seeking comfort and serenity. you can get on anywhere you like
but it's all the same.
to live in present is closest to serenity because it is the most easily available
or the easiest to understand. now. here. i feel it and it exists.

there is no competition that exists in debating what time it is. it just is that time.
if you try to understand what came before
specifically for the reason that you're out of time and context. they didn't share your now.
they weren't concerned about debating it because the truth is true regardless of time.
it looks different
the same. different people talk about different ways.
scientist talk about it in terms of a thing that is expanding
religions thinks there a force behind it all
fuel their own ambitions against each other. they miss the point entirely.
some people are still just interested in living their lives in a way
which causes the least amount of suffering.
they don't know how to fix those who suffer
they are caught in the middle of these issues. these illusions.
all frightening. all governed by people.. wealthy people.. who know all too well
this truth and provides its citizens with the soothing comforts of living 
a day to day life
preserving it as long as possible. and who can blame them for seeking that comfort.
that resolution. and who am i in the midst of all this.
a person who gets off on understanding or perceiving this truth.

i am but a cog in the machine.
a connector of ideas or people
often feels hopelessly alone. 
did i fall in a trap? or a leap of faith?
or perhaps that in reality there is no gap but the gaps that we create.
and that we in turn seek to repair.
chasing its own tail.
circle jerk. 
i won't go into the details for your amusement


upon further reflection
getting off on making these connections or even presenting these ideas
in any way harms other people. i do not think that it does but then again
i can never quite be sure whether or not i am falling into the category 
of manipulator when i utter the words.
the crafting of the sentences and words which convey these ideas are in
themselves a material that is being manipulated.
and i think that although this has occurred to me many times before
never quite get that idea out of my head.
so, not of rhetoric but of a material 
or a form which allows a universal connection free from words. 
this form is music.

once in a while i will try to fit words into it
is for you to feel comfortable. even if only for a short time.
don't praise me. don't reward me. just feel happy. happy that it exists
and that it is possible for you at that very moment to lose yourself.
or find yourself. whatever it is. just relax. this is love.

it is much easier to experience this when  you are young
because you are less frightened
it can seem very appealing
again
an appealing illusion
filled with images riddled with beauty. a rose that is blossoming.
in bloom as cobain put it.
""but he knows not what it means""

on a side note
which charmingly sounds the same as the english we

-what would you do if you won a million dollars?
-nothing. i would just sit back
-shit man
take a look at my cousin. he's broke and he don't do shit.
-what would you do?
-two chicks at the same time


reality tv
survivor

i find it interesting that the ""first"" reality tv show that set the 
precedent for all other reality tv shows was really just an artificial 
reality show. it was arranged in a way to enable situations in which
we the viewer would observe these people who are trying to figure out
what to do in the face of a game that is rigged so that only one winner
is possible. this is why i think it is so interesting. but in all honesty
i'm amazed that it has lasted as long as it has.
sure
never fell short of providing eye candy for their viewers to consume.
by which of course i mean the scantily clad bikini women running around
or the ripped dudes with cut abs. and everything in between.
their contestant selection has always no doubt based on these factors 
first and foremost. but the show hasn't really changed that much.
the goal or object of the game is still the same.
this show has been running for 24 seasons with at least 2 other seasons yet to be made.
The format for Survivor was created in 1992 by British television producer Charlie Parsons.

My partner and I imbibed 1.5 grams the shroom around 3:15pm. We only ate 1.5grams because this was our first trip and we didn't know what to expect. Around 4:20 I start to feel it. Everything looks more interesting. My adventure time poster looks like its wobbling. We do a bowl of trees and go for a bike right. 

It was a little difficult to undo the bike lock

We come down a steep hill to a busy stretch of road. It made me anxious. As were biking fast down this hill I start hearing a high pitched roaring. Im not sure what it was

When we get to the park I am very relived. All the trees look awesome. I really want to stop and look at them
This whole time my mind is filled with strange

We find a spot by the river to sit down and admire the nature. We didn't notice how shitty of a spot it was until we got there. There was a factory visible through the trees and it very noisy with the sound of trucks. The water was pea soup green with algae from the phosphorous polluted water.  I loved looking at the trees. One tree had leafs forming geometric patterns. My partner had a panic attack for no reason. 

We biked and I noticed how dirty/shitty my apartment building was. It was very hard to lock out bikes. The whole time I was in my apartment

Time: 6:20

We were sweaty after the bike ride and took a shower. I looked in the mirror and saw how dilated my pupils were. My pupils are normally tiny

I kept forgetting what I was doing

I go visit friends who live nearby. I ring the door bell and don't get a response for about 30 seconds. I find out reason for the delay is one of my friends was going into diabetic coma. She need a mountain dew and and she recovered fine. For the first time in my life I can feel compassion for someone sick and I am freaked out by the mortality of the situation.  

I hung out with them until the shroom wore off. I didn't really notice when it happened

Yesterday I didn't feel like eating mushrooms because the thought of it made me feel sick (can't get over that taste)

I read up on how to make a tea out of them

I think I went completely wrong here, then I added boiling water for about 10 minutes, added 1/4th of a tablespoon of lime juice (the cocktail stuff you can buy) and a apple cinnamon tea bag in a cup. I strained the mushroom juice through a coffee filter into the cup and drank the lot.

It all started okay....however, in my head, is actually to break free from this god and the last couple of times I've taken shrooms I have felt exactly this way.

This time however, I was still doing things, I just had no control anymore and I can't remember them). I ended up going to bed and because I thought my wife was fake anyway and she'd be fine no matter what I was doing to her, I was hurting her and kicking her and trying to break her fingers and strangling her because - in my head - I thought there was no consequence anyway because I thought after the shrooms would work out, this god would just put me back in this simulation and she'd be fine again....

unfortunately, with piss all over the place (I had pissed the bed) and my wife frightened of me as I found her in a different bedroom(first thing I did was go search for her as I was pretty scared of having actually killed her...).

Iced Tea:
-21 grams to 28 grams dried Psilocybe
Cubensis mushrooms (at a minimum of
21 grams.)
-2 whole lemons (vitamin c)
-1 whole ginger root (for nausea)
-2 whole bunches of fresh mint leaves
(for that fresh herbal taste)
-8 tea bags of ""good earth"" brand tea
(flavor is up to you
-1/4th bottle of honey
-10 cups of water

1.) Pour 10 cups of water into the biggest pot you have.
2.) Set to high heat and bring to a boil.
3.) Once boiling
4.) After approximately 7-10 minutes bring the heat to Medium/Medium-High
5.) Now, the whole point is to make this as delicious as possible!
6.) Once taste level has been reached, chopped lemons, AFTER squeezing all the juice into the pot!
7.) Add at least 21 grams of the dried cubensis mushrooms while stirring on low heat.

8.) Place the lid on the pot and let sit, but are brown.

9.) Remove the pot from heat

10.) Using a clean funnel, Gatorade bottle, any plastic bottle that's been washed, rinsed, or cleaned out properly)
and then bottle your mystical

11.) Place it in the fridge and let it get ice cold. Make sure to protect it from unsuspecting fridge raiders!

----------------------------------------

What good is a tea party without something to snack on?

Sesame Honey Balls:

-7-8 grams dried cubensis mushrooms
-1 bag of at least 40 grams worth of whole sesame seeds
-Bottled honey

1.) In a blender, pulverize until fine powder.

2.) Pour mixture into a bowl and integrate and mix the seed powder and shroom powder until it's very indistinguishable. Pulverize more sesame seeds if needed.

3.) Add honey and mix with spoon to achieve a dough/clay-like consistency.

4.) Hand roll and press into little balls.

5.) Roll the sesame balls into a pile of the whole sesame seeds.

6.) Repeat steps 4-5 until done.

7.) Place in a tight Tupperware container and refrigerate alongside the tea.


The tea and the sesame balls should each serve 8 people. 

Each person will be consuming approximately 5 grams worth of Psilocybe Cubensis. Sit back and enjoy on an empty stomach.

Then I discovered LSD and she blew my brains big time. I strictly tripped acid for maybe a few months and then decided one night to eat a solid 7 grams of shrooms with my cousin. He certainly tripped while I was left with a slightly increased amount of energy and enlarged pupils, on very high doses, and my shroom pal wont come back. I experience mild effects at best.  Also, I've always been with at least one other friend who tripped so I know the shrooms arent unusually weak. It's to the point where I feel it's a waste of drugs to trip on shrooms :(

1372724264.0,1hgojt,My 7g shroom trip.,coreyapayne,20,4,27,"*This trip was nary particularly mind bending by any means. It more effected the why my brain worked from a psychological stand point. Do not eat 7 grams expecting a similar effect if you are inexperienced with this substance. Mushrooms are powerful and I have been lost and separated from my body for hours on a dose half this size.* Be careful and always use caution and best judgement*




When I ate 7gs I initially felt relatively normal some subtle visuals kicked in first, done. (Setting up the hookah, putting on some music, getting refreshments) I felt really angry and annoyed and kept repeating ""life is hard"" over and over. I then separated myself to listen to music and calm down. This is where it got crazy. I put in headphones and sat on the kitchen floor and closed my eyes. HOLY SHIT. When I closed my eyes I went to a completely different world, there were strange colorful striped creatures crawling towards me, all kinds of completely unnatural things that freaked me out so bad I couldn't keep my eyes closed. I switched back and forth between keeping my eyes open and closing them for a while, while listening to some random edm pandora station. (I like edm in those instances because I don't feel like it imposes an emotion upon me

I somehow managed to calm my frustration and anger from earlier and rejoined the group

The trip changed again here. I started watching my favorite show Community. Took a hit or two from my bubbler and I ended up crying due to a moving and emotional scene in the show. I believed I had an epiphany about what the show was really written about at its core, there were spinning wheels and crazy stuff going on in the back grounds of every scene that reminded me of a really happy carnival. And everyone seemed to pop out from the screen in ultra definition.

Anyways...

 From this point forward the best word to describe my being was understanding. I understood everything. I knew what people were thinking

I apologize for the lack of intense description of certain elements

Also just an ad on, and I much prefer lsd and the way it makes me feel and see and all that other good stuff.

We parked next to a very large park in our town

About 15 minutes in we were all definitely feeling something

At around 25 minutes in we decided to lay on a small bridge off the trail

We were laying there for about 25 minutes and then a track team ran by us and said hi. We took this as a signal to get up and keep walking. We were on a grass trail now (1:30ish) and my friend asked us if we wanted to smoke. We all agreed to let the shrooms carry us on for another hour and that we would smoke at 2:30. 

We laid on the grass and looked up the sky and watched a plane fly by. I’ll never forget that sight because it was the most beautiful thing we’ve ever seen I actually started crying from it. We opened another bag of pretzel sticks which felt like it took us an eternity to eat. (We would keep reaching our hands in the bag and think that more pretzels had just appeared). 

2:30 rolled around and we rolled two joints with the dub we had brought and smoked them. Nothing even felt real at this point while I was smoking. After we finished I decided to put my head phones and blast some more pink Floyd. 

I closed my eyes and laid down where I had awesome closed eye hallucinations of being in a room that was turning different colors and textures depending on what the music was doing. It was like I could see the music in my head

I opened my eyes and took my headphones out and started talking to my one friend

It’s about 4:00 now and we were still lying in the middle of the grass

I came back around 4:30 to my friends still laying there. I was getting a phone call from three of my friends who knew  was doing shrooms at the time and wanted to come visit

We started walking back to the car a little after 5:00ish

Here I am, and I AM SO INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!! I have the most amazing boyfriend in the world. who loves me for who i am, what i look like, whether i just woke up with an aweful hangover looking like dog shit, or after just having spent hours pampering myself for. He loves me no matter what. How could I not be any happier, I could end it just at that! But I have so much more in my life that makes me that much more happy. I have an amazing family, that despite not agreeing with my choices because i don't agree with theirs, and sister to my 5 beautiful, educated... I could go on and on. My sisters are more than amazing. They're there for me when I need them most, opening
Draco names have been changed as to not identify OP and I split a magic chocolate about 4 hours ago. We started Despical Me and waited for the mushrooms to hit. About a half hour later, listening to Stevie Nicks, while Draco plays his games and I am reflecting on my life. I love my life. I would change nothing about it. And if I wanted to, I know that it's all up to me. I am free to do whatever I want to do with my life, because only I control it.
It took me a while to realize that only I had control over my life. Tonight is actually the night that I realized that. Tonight is the night that I finally broke free from the grasps of the Mormon church. For years I have been living under a constant fear, that I would go no where in life. I would not receive ''blessings'' and advance in my life, and most importantly, I was told I COULD NOT BE HAPPY. Who the hell are they to tell me that I can't be happy without their god and controlling religion stuffed down my throat. HOW .. how could I be happy, that way? not having a mind to think for my own, and if I did - god help me, I better feel guilty about it. Cause if I don't feel guilty about it, and be with my FAMILY.
This is probably my fifth or sixth time eating mushrooms. Tonight is the very first night I ate mushrooms and did not have a bad trip. Tonight was the first time tripping, until i was truly remorse and asked for repentance and swear that i'll be good and go to church and never eat shrooms again, just give me back normal reception of reality. Every other time I ate mushrooms, I would end up in that exact bad trip, because I would feel guilty for eating mushrooms. I would torture myself into thinking that this was gods punishment on me, and that i won't come back to reality until i accept him and apologize. But, as of tonight - no more!! Because there is no god that is controlling my life and deciding on whether or not my last thought of sucking a dick is going to keep me from being happy. I AM HAPPY. I.AM.FREE!!!

1361727030.0,195114,My first experience,syouganai,17,1,12,"So it has been a while now since I first did shrooms. About 2 months. I know many of you see these experience stories and lots of people post them but I just thought that a few of you might enjoy to read mine like I enjoy reading yours. I took about half an eighth with my bf early afternoon on a Sunday. When it started kicking in we were watching arrested development and green trails of light started to appear behind people walking on screen. Soon it looked like my entire wall was becoming the tv and I couldn't  handle looking at it. I went to talk to my roommate who was sober and quickly came to the conclusion that he could not keep up with my conversation and I left to go back to my room. 

I got stuck in my head, and felt timeless. This caused me to feel quite anxious but I managed. It was here that I figured out why it is called a ""trip."" When I closed my eyes I could still see in my mind. Was so bizarre. 

I dealt with these strange unexplainable visions in my head for a few hours until I reached a point where I could control my body and feel more connected so I got up and went back to my roommates room. He put on exogenesis symphony from Muse and it was fucking incredible. Those 3 tracks took me through every emotion and facet of my mind. I kept obsessing about things in my life...like my responsibility, I glanced at the clock and again my physical vision blurred as my mind took me elsewhere. I can't recall details of this part but I would snap back into lucidity and tell my roommate that I want to bring this back. Back to them. Back to the world. This new found truth that I had discovered. Part of that truth was an explanation on life...details evade me but I began thinking that I had ""woken"" up in this new reality. The new reality included this knowledge that our day to day lives were more controlled than we could possibly know...that there are cycles in life that are controlled outside of our knowledge. I dived further and further into music and tried to google a quote from my favorite series, Battlestar Galactica. ""Life has a melody Gaius. A rhythm of notes which become your existence once played in harmony with God's plan."" (Btw, I am atheist but this quote has always hit me hard. I love it. ) Anyway, I searched for this quote and as I was looking at the google results ...all of the links changed on their own. It was like the letters shifted into new words themselves and all of the search results were titles of all the songs that speak to my soul, so to speak. You know what I mean. 

Anyway soon after this, we are controlled. I thought that we had escaped so to speak...that me and my group of friends were using this time to meet for something...something big. Everything has a beat and a rhythm. I began thinking that my whole life was just set up for me (I was looping this back to the ""checks"" that always caught me before I could fail in life) everything made sense. I was so excited to believe that I could throw my whole life away for this new one. I kept tapping my foot to a beat this entire time (all along the watch tower) and no matter what was playing in the background, everything gravitated towards this beat. We were connected. 

As I type this I can't put into words what this did to me. My comedown was depressing. My brain was exhausted. I was upset that my new found knowledge of how there is so much more to life was just suddenly...gone. To this day I keep obsessing over one specific part. It was when I was looking up the ""Life has a melody gaius."" I felt like taking shrooms let me plug into something bigger, what are we, where are we"" my physical vision would blur...to my roommates I would zone out and speak a little nonsense but I would snap back into reality and I told them several times... ""I wish I could bring this back.""

I wish I could remember what ""this"" was. All I know is at the time it felt like some sort of grand enlightenment. Maybe someday I will remember. ",self,t5_2qszq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/195114/my_first_experience/

We woke up around 9AM in our hostel and had breakfast. We then rented bikes to go around the city for a couple hours. At around 1pm


After we waited half an hour


First, fast! I ran to the nearest fast food place and ordered fries. When I put that first fry in my mouth, I must have chewed it close to 5 minutes without successfully swallowing it. Later, I had to spit it out. I was desperately thinking to call a doctor or go to the police. At that point, I was feeling extremely small like a dwarf or even smaller and everything was much much bigger than me. Luckily, my friend was not feeling that bad and he was trying to help me overcome the anxiety.


It took us (me) around 2 hours to get over the anxiety. During that, we walked to the train station and were there around 5:30pm. We had 1 hour to kill but none of us had energy to do something. Last time we had something to eat was 8 hours ago and had been walking non-stop. So we stood there almost like zombies. We did not talk much. At one point, my friend had to pee so we ""tried"" to get into the station and find a toilet. When we found the toilet, we were too scared to go in! So, we got out of there and felt lucky to be alive (I know it sounds dumb but really that was the feeling). Finally, 10 minutes before our departure, we held hands together ( both male) and found our train and wagon and hop on it. 


The train ride was very calm. We talked non stop for 1.5 hours before a switch in my brain literally turned off. I was ""awake"" again and no more thoughts were rushing to my head. Everything seemed clear and silent. My friend experienced a similar wakening 5-10 minutes after than me.

2:20 am. I'm walking my bike up to my shed. I turn around and this cat that I had seen a few hours ago and had stopped to pet was behind me. 

It was a well fed black cat

He came up to me for more attention. I put my bike in the shed and turn around.

The cat is walking away, I notice the cat had followed me. He mows at me. I stare back at him.

Without skipping a beat

I kneel down to his level, but continues on.

At this point, around their trees, inspecting what he was inspecting and following him, all the while feeling like I was being led by the cat. 

He looked in a sewer pipe

Suddenly, about 9 or 10 feet off the ground. It continued to climb up and down the branches, and occasionally let out a meow.

At this point, something I had never witnessed before. I decided it was time to go, but I had no idea how to say this to the cat. I literally looked him in the eye, and went ""five...four...three..."" and counted to zero. At this point, he came down to the lower branches and was obviously looking for the easiest way down.

My jaw dropped. I had literally just counted down to zero and made an animal come down from a tree. I kept following him around and I tried to grab him a few times

What I see is this: A racoon, at their own rhythm and pace. I was at one with nature. I bent over and picked up the cat. I started to walk up my street, towards my house.

As if by magic, as I walked up my street holding this cat I had just met in my hands. The cat remained so calm, and I felt like he was an orb of power guiding my back home. I laughed, a crazy yet quiet mushy laugh, as I walked up the street. I felt emotions I can't even describe today.

I put the cat down infront of my house, and then disapeared into the backyard infront of my house. It was at this point that I went home.",,False,self,t5_2qszq,False,,

Before: 
I am going to take 5g dried mushrooms alone. I have no human company but my two dogs should keep me from feeling lonely, Neuro Bliss, coconut water, green tea, honey, and ginger root. I have some palo santo to light and meditate by while waiting for the trip to begin. I have also made an appropriate playlist of music to last throughout the experience. The weather is beautiful should I want to go out into nature, but the comfort of my home should provide a good setting. I realize that 5g is considered to be a strong dose, but I only have 5g and if I were to split it up I may not have the opportunity for a strong trip for quite some time. I can honestly say that I am not nervous at all. If this had been months or years ago I would most likely be nervous but that is no longer the case.
After: 
The mushrooms were much easier to eat plain than I had anticipated. I don’t understand the trouble some people have with it. They tasted earthy and plain. After eating them I drank a full glass of the drink that I made, and lit the palo santo. While waiting for the effects to begin I closed my eyes and meditated. I did not open them until I felt a strong body high starting to kick in. When I looked around the room everything still looked surprisingly normal, although this is probably not the correct word. I did not yet have any “visuals”, but the things around me seemed very strange. Objects that I had previously paid no attention to now seemed funny to me, and I couldn’t help but see faces and bodies in everything, much like cloud gazing. The next visual step was the colors. The smoke from the palo santo, as well as everything else, with almost no effort. The knowledge however was not gained, or I was just unaware of my the fact that it was there. Some things which I previously thought to be important issues to think about seemed silly, although the English language soon proved itself to be very insufficient. I kept telling myself that during some other trip I would write
	After a while my dogs needed to go outside so I stood up, moths, bees, flies, and other insects seemed to be highlighted and my attention was directed to them, as if my eyes were magnetized to life. When petting my dogs they seemed to be stuffed animals, but hollow on the inside except for a spirit that was, no less significant than my own. Rain soon started to fall
	When I returned inside my house, low light, and the scent of the palo santo transformed what was once simply my house into a sanctuary. I found myself appreciating the natural colors of my home, like the browns and greens, more than any others. When I sat down and covered myself with a blanket which proved to be a physical ecstasy, the inner dialogue resumed at full strength. I felt a strong desire to express myself through music, drawing, and writing, but instead a pure, meditating on the idea and even envisioning myself dying. None of this seemed the least bit frightening. It was a concept equally as beautiful to me as life
	As I found myself peaking, but it is worth noting that I remained firmly in this dimension. When I closed my eyes I still had visuals but the light that penetrated my eyelids was still disruptive, and when I put my hands over my eyelids this visuals became much more pure, like peering into space. I decided once again, to try this during another trip, with a blindfold, and perhaps hearing deprivation as well. Throughout my trip I felt a strong, in the back of my head. It did not feel painful and I mostly ignored it
	While my trip was still strong I suddenly felt myself compelled to something that I had not at all planned on. I somehow managed to turn on my TV and PS3
	When I felt myself starting to come down I took a shower, I felt down and disappointed with my ape-like, problem solving, sober consciousness. Nothing that I normally do to keep myself busy appealed to me in the least and I was very bored, although I had no desire to reflect on my trip. It was as if my brain was exhausted and needed to recharge. I went to sleep early, and when I woke up in the morning, despite the migraine, which was a very difficult task the night before.  As the day went on I found myself recalling more and more of it. Overall the trip was extremely positive.

1376167181.0,1k3v7d,"My first trip - the good, the bad, and the kitten.",HateWinslet,15,5, it will not disappoint. The clouds were these infinitely cascading fractals with pale rainbow edges that sort of dissolved and swirled like paint. The bigger clouds had really big facets. This went on for about an hour or so. It was truly magnificent and I hope I never forget it.

2. I stood up and felt somewhat separated from my body. It was difficult to control it - I felt more like a pilot controlling a clumsy machine than a person. This continued throughout the trip and became a bit of a problem later on.

3. I stood and watched the dusk fall. My balcony faces east towards lake Michigan, in front of the backdrop of the neon fractal clouds, was incredible.

4. This is when I started feeling really melancholy about the futility of life. I was growing increasingly angry at how limited my body was. I kept thinking about how depressingly brief and fragile human life is - there are infinite beautiful things to see and hear and touch and experience emotionally

5. I went inside and talked to my kitten. This is the most ridiculous and hilarious part of the trip to me. I leaned down, so I kept telling her not to worry so much. 

6. I really, technology was very confusing - I didn't quite remember the differences between cable, internet, apple TV, and my phone. I texted my boyfriend and had to troubleshoot the modem while I was still on mushrooms.

7. Unfortunately, regardless of the fact that I knew it was a hallucination. I ran into the living room and things got real.

8. I sat on the couch and continued to feel sorry for myself - I was so frustrated about my limitations as a human in a body that I started punching my leg really hard. Understanding time was very difficult - I knew I'd be feeling better in a few hours

9. I finally managed to turn on the cable and felt instantly better - the temporal nature of television gave me something by which I could tell the passing of time. That was so comforting. Also, period. So, good luck there!

The whole trip only lasted about 4 hours. I ate 3 grams. I eventually managed to order some food and went outside to talk to my neighbors. I don't really feel like this was a bad trip - it just very real at times. I don't think I was expecting the self-reflection aspect of it to be so brutal and emotional. I study Buddhism and attend a temple regularly

I'm exhausted today and still a little foggy. I'm normally a good writer

It probably makes no sense though. Everything is still really hazy. Skip to the third paragraph if you only want to read about my trip.

I tried shrooms for the first time last night. It all started out with me getting home and checking the mail. I had finally received my spore syringes. I texted my boyfriend and we freak out

I was ecstatic.

We agree to a more than fair price (35$ for 2 eighths and my boyfriend offered to smoke the guy out). We then leave the friends house and head over to my boyfriends. When we get there a group of people from our school are waiting for us. We go inside and get everyone situated. The bong is brought out and people start getting drinks. The dealer dude

We know that this is just the beginning.

After this point my memories are very hazy so bear with me while i try to explain what was going on. Everyone around me is talking and having a wonderful time. This is when i began feeling like an onlooker who is just observing this world. Another friend stops by and wants to show my boyfriend his car. It was red and thats all i remember. It was also really really nice. We agree to a plan, and black were the colors that followed me where ever i went. I drifted around the house observing the world. This one girls eyes were so green that i asked her if she was wearing colored contacts. She wasnt. I eventually made it out to the patio again and sat down. It was super chill. I felt restless though. My mouth was dry and my heart was beating fast. I go to get water and whenever i would take a sip i felt like i was eating chunks of sand. Any repetitive noises would draw me in and begin pulling me deeper and deeper into the trip.

I really had to pee.

I walk towards the bathroom and my whole body is being tickled by the air. The hall to the bathroom was dark and when i walked through it i had tunnel vision. As a child i was always afraid of the dark. I rush into the bathroom and turn on the light

My eyes.

The pupils were the size of my iris

Thats when things started to get out of control.

Something was drawing me deeper and deeper into my subconscious. I took a sip of water and felt like i was going to puke. I knew i t was all in my head but that was the problem. My head was controlling this whole thing so it could do whatever it wanted. I walk out to the patio and tell my boyfriend that i dont feel very good. Then i proceed to vomit on the patio floor. It was disgusting and everyone is telling me to go outside. I go and my boyfriend follows me. The grass is waving at me and chills run down my spine. I puke a few more times. My boyfriend is trying to assure me that i can control it but i keep telling him that i cant. 

It was the monster.

The monster that was living inside my soul. The monster knew that i could do whatever it wanted. It was controlling me and the rest of the universe. I tried explaining how I could not tell the difference between reality and my minds illusions. Then my reality was stuck in an endless loop. I was having the same sensation over and over again. The world was a cube and it kept on rotating

Time seemed to move alot slower than it usually would.

What was really three minutes felt like hours upon hours. I am mumbling to someone about the universe and how none of this was real. It was all i could think about. Each wave was pulling me deeper and all i could do was hold onto my boyfriends hand and never let go. He reminder me of a snake. His pupils were huge and his eyes were almost black. His skin also kept turning purple. He also reminded me of a doctor. He was helping me through this and try to make me understand what was happening.

I also couldnt imagine a world where i wasnt tripping.

I thought that my mind would stay like this forever. I didnt know what to do. I wanted to stay like this but i knew it would be too hard to please the monster. Everytime i talked it would be about the monster and when i talked about the monster my eyes were wide and i got this look on my face

This is the longest thing i have ever typed. Wow. I feel like i understand but then at the same time it makes everything even more confusing. I think the world just cannot be comprehended and our mind just cannot grasp the concept of how everything fits together like little puzzle pieces

On this trip I had a 15 second seizure as a result of my blood pressure getting to high. More on that later.

Let me preface by saying I am extremely experienced with shrooms. I had tripped at least 50 times prior to this night. I also prefer to trip alone

It was Easter night of 2012. I had just gotten back to my house that I rent while in college from visiting my parents. I was super excited to get home and trip. I was growing at the time and had 40 grams (wet) (bout 6 dry). I chopped them up into little pieces and soaked them in lemon juice for an hour. I took two nitrous oxide bodybuilding supplement capsules with a glass of water and then slammed the lemon juice and shrooms. 

All I can say is Holy Shit. I remember being in the shower when they hit after about 30-45 min. The shower curtain was doing waves with the different colors you always see. There was the most beautiful pattern and colors in the water drops on the walls of the shower. It looked like fools gold if that made sense. I probably stood under the stream of water for a good 20 minutes. Not that exciting. But let me tell you it felt amazing. 

I finally realize I've just been standing there and get out. I open the bathroom door and the steam billows out into the hallway. It was fuckin' magical. I probably had the dumbest grin on my face. I get dressed and go lay down on the couch and just take in the most dramatic visuals I've ever had. I could see faces in the shadows on the wall

So anyways. One hour since trip began: 
I find myself walking around and just observing things. You know
Its safe to say at this point I have lost my ego and start to introspectively ponder the existence of life
I had this epiphany which if you don't want to read

Take an orange tree for example. Lets say this orange tree has 100 oranges. Lets also say theres no animals or humans to take/eat any of those oranges. At the end of the growing season those oranges would fall off and decompose into the soil essentially 'recycling' 100 oranges worth of nutrients. Now lets say that humans come by and take all 100 oranges. Now, the computer you're using....everything that you see around you was made by manipulating the organic matter of the Earth- whether that be chemically of physically. Nature is the reason we're alive. Humans have lost respect for the Earth and we have been taking all of the oranges off the tree. Our demise, this planets demise will be a product of our own greed and oblivion. The future is going to be how can we create all this without taking all the oranges from the tree.  
Anyways
Plus if you ever have the opportunity to pick an orange from the tree and eat it while sitting under the tree on shrooms

About 3:00 in at this point
 I am starting to peak-
And thats when I decide to go out to the garage.

The garage has plywood wall to wall and a flickering fluorescent light. Everything is dusty and theres sounds that just echoed and resonated in my ears that just made the room special. Anyways, just standing silently listening to the light flicker, the sounds outside and the tobacco burning and sizzling as I took a puff. Really fucking beautiful experience. The nicotine made me feel at ease and I was struck with a moment of clarity that I've never experienced.

I would have to say that that moment of clarity was the most euphoric moment I have ever experienced. I have always had this feeling while shrooming before. This feeling of ""you know what I mean"". The feeling that I could never explain yet felt I needed to tell about. In that moment I feel as if I finally understood that feeling and what it was/about. Yet

Lets be clear. At this point I am tripping my fucking balls off. Usually I can handle it not a problem

Anyways I come inside and just stand there for a good 15 minutes watching the hardwood floor 'flow' and I go and turn on the TV
This was a mistake. I don't know why I did it but I did. This commercial starts playing for the ""No No hair remover"" This lady (who looked like a plastic doll with just an evil smirk) kept saying ""no no"". I just stood there chanting it. 

This is when I lost my fucking shit. 

I couldn't comprehend what I was saying and I started hyperventilating. Next thing I know there is a tingling sensation in the tips of my fingers and my hands seize up. I fell to the ground and started seizing. I remember not knowing what was happening. I closed my eyes and next thing I know

When I opened my eyes
about 20 minutes later I got up and just started running my hand over objects and finally made it to the sink where I took a drink of water. color had started to reappear

At that point I rapidly came down off the trip to a certain extent. I was trembling and shaking just blown away by what happened. I realized I had a seizure and just kept telling myself to snap out of it. It sobered me up to the point to where it didn't ruin the trip

I got an MRI

The blood pressure was raised by the shrooms, and last but not least the hyperventilation. 

Upon research I realized that fresh shrooms also contain psilocin which is lost when the shrooms are dried. In other words I took 40 grams of fresh ultra potent shrooms. Twice as potent than if they had been dried.

That was my first mistake. The second was the Nitrous Oxide and the smoking.

As of today

It didn't ruin shrooms for me

You don't need to take large doses to have good trips trust me

Peace and love





**EDIT:** Corrected my horrific grammar and spelling :)

Also added this paragraph:  
""I would have to say that that moment of clarity was the most euphoric moment I have ever experienced. I have always had this feeling while shrooming before. This feeling of ""you know what I mean"". The feeling that I could never explain yet felt I needed to tell about. In that moment I feel as if I finally understood that feeling and what it was/about. Yet
(Near the center)

And this sentence:
""I feel like it left me with profound knowledge that I have yet to realize."" 
(In the last paragraph)

My surroundings were all changing before my eyes.  People were scary to me and noises were much louder, a pretty subtle glow.  I remember standing up to check on my friend throwing up because he seemed to of disappeared and I felt like a giant.  All the crevices in my skin seemed to stand out more and my fingers and toes looked more alien like.  Then I looked over at a group of trees and the leaves were red, yellow, pink, green, and the bark on the tree in the foreground looked like it was drawn and it started to move slowly toward me.  It looked almost like an Alice in Wonderland scene.  I looked at my friend and his eyes were glowing with color and kind of morphing as well.  We tried to smoke some weed to relax our stomachs and the trip but packing the bowl and lighting it seemed almost impossible.  I also was getting the weirdest thoughts in my head like I was on another planet and that time was irrelevant. Patterns started swirling around the grass like a disco bulb and my friend and I decided to go biking to the zoo.  First we went inside the Arboretum building to get some water the stained glass on the door looked like it was moving like matrix like designs and dribbled onto the floor.  I tried filling up my water but got too freaked out by the people around me and bolted out of the building.  Then things started to get crazy. 

 My friend and I started biking and I started thinking I was in a dream and my friend kind of became a stranger to me.  I kept repeating names and some stupid shit and he started tripping out and was kind of afraid since I was unresponsive to his questions.  For some reason I couldnt express my thoughts to him because I couldn't remember exactly who he was.  I thought that I randomly biked up to him and started bugging him so I was really confused.  For some reason I started thinking that I needed a dog or a girl to be with me and the next time I want to trip I need to be with a girl.  But then I started thinking that vaginas and dicks were the same thing and I couldnt help but thinking about my bed.  

I randomly asked my friend if I was gay because in my head again I was thinking that a vagina was a penis. He tried convincing me that I wasnt gay but I kept thinking that dicks were vaginas. Thats when he seriously started having a bad trip and then I thought that he was a butch lesbian and that we were growing old together. I also called out a bunch of different names at him because I couldnt remember who he was. I was also convinced I was a hippie and that I was getting really old.  Once we arrived to the zoo we didn't park out bikes and I was just riding my bike through the zoo like an asshole even though my friend told me to get off my bike.  I just had no control over my actions or emotions and I was thinking very irrationally.  Even though all of this was happening I still had a great time.  We saw some Polar Bears
Once things started calming down I was blown away by my experience and wanted to trip again.  My friend was pretty bugged out by me because I was acting like a madman and he thought I was gay.  Keep in mind this was my first time tripping and my friend was pretty experienced but wasn't ready for the insanity that ensued.  

All in all I had an amazing, hence why I was so uncontrollable.  I think next time I will ease into the dose, like half eighth then take the other half.  Definitely need to trip with a girl next time so I can be affectionate. Ever since I took the shrooms I have been more confident and feel like I have a different perspective on all my actions. Just had to write my experience down because it was truly mind blowing.  ",,False,self,t5_2qszq,,http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/zbpos/my_first_experience_on_shrooms_amazing/

1346261867.0,z12vq,my first trip story (about 1 year ago),airbrush_wizard,14,2,1,"So one day me and 3 friends decided to take some shrooms. One of my friends was a pro at them lol because he has done them plenty of times. I was nervous because i did not know what  to expect. So i ate about 1.5 grams. Sitting there waiting i ate about 2 caps more and chewed on a stem. At that point about 30 min later i felt a huge wave of heat take me over. I knew it was time to ride. I looked at everyone in the room and  they looked at me and we laughed like we never have for literally 20 minutes. i tried to draw but when the sharpie hit the paper it had a ghost trail next to it basically tracing my lines but 1 inch away. I decided to take my friends seat who just got up. he came back and wanted his seat and i didnt wanna get up because it was super comfy. So i got up and was like SHIT i need a new seat, chill on and enjoy the ride. I then said fuck it and switched to some upbeat techno to maybe change the feel. The bass was talking to me and i could not believe it. At this point i went back over to the other side to get back into the feel good area as i was kinda buggin. Got back and i felt at ease. I sat down and literally just began to laugh again for soooo long. we looked at visuals on the computer for house before i had to pee. I told myself i was not gonna look into the mirror, as i became aware  i traveled closer and closer untill i felt i should not go any further. I did not know if it was me rising to my death or my chanc to experience another world of infinite information. That pretty much sums up my first . Also i drew some intense shit on the wall. if i find it i will ninja edit and post"

1376213078.0,1k4y3k,First Time Trip Report - 1.75g Shroom Tea,SevenSeasOfRhye,14,3,9,"So I have been researching shrooms for the past 6 months thinking about trying them. A week ago I said fuck it

I drank the tea at around 6:00 p.m. The only thing I had eaten previously was one piece of bread with nutella on it at like 11:00

I drink the black tea shrooms and it's great. Doesn't taste like shrooms at all. Tastes like good ole nice black tea. I also swallowed some of the grounded up parts of the shrooms that made it through the strainer. 

At 6:10 I feel an effect that I would get from weed. Slightly happier

Then

I went into my room and sat down at the computer to listen to music. I started listening to Somebody To Love by Queen. It sounded AMAZING so already I could tell things were changing. Though

At this point, turned on the TV and watch some Netflix. I watched a Bill Burr Stand Up comedy. Here's where things REALLY went south.

6:15 - I'm really worried about how I feel. I get a lot of anxiety for no reason. Actually

6:18 - I thought that this agony would never end. I just thought, Things started getting better.

6:20 - I had started shaking and taking really big breaths because of all the anxiety. It was at this point that I would look at the stand up comedian and at one point when he opened his mouth.. it looked like it stretched out REALLY big than ripped open. Fucking terrifying! Then I looked up at this poster of apple's history in my room and the colors started morphing at I got frighted at first

6:22 - Suddenly

6:30 - I'm soaking in happiness. Wonderful euphoria and peace. I feel confident about my self and my surroundings. I get up and walk
I pet it and its fur was so soft and sweet. I then got up and went to the bathroom to take a piss. HOLY mother of god! This piss was AMAZING. Next I sat on a couch in my living room that overviews the lake and the other side of the city. Then I looked at the sky and clouds and started sobbing again at all the beauty and happiness and how great life is. I thought about many important things in my life that had been bugging me. I came to peace with most of them. At this point

6:50 - friend arrives. I'm surprised. Also now my trip changes. I'm so much more talkative! I let him vape a trench of kief in my MFLB to make sure he has a good time also. This was great

8:30-9:00 - Visuals really start to kick in. I have many persian rugs in my house and if you own a persian rug you would know that these things are so cool while tripping! All the patterns were swirling around and meeting each other and blending. It was also at this time that the sunset started happening and I stared at the clouds for like 10-20 minutes. 

9:20 - I take 2 hits from the kief trench in the MFLB. Visuals REALLY start coming. My friend and I are both good piano players (If I do say so myself) so we just both sat at the piano and started playing and composing. We had the lights turned off and this part was AWESOME. Not only because of the music, but I can't remember all of it right now.

The night basically carried on like that. Playing music, but it tasted like shrooms for some reason haha. I ate a lot of ice cream though. I came down to what I think reality is like, at around 11:00-11:30 p.m So all together it lasted around 5 hours. It was nice! Though those 5 hours seemed to last a reaalll long time. Right now, I still feel some what different. But I know that I'm sober, I just feel... a little different. I think after I sleep and wake up tomorrow it will fully be over. Though I would overall rate this as an awesome experience!!

I think that I will eventually do shrooms again

Last saturday
We relaxed at my friends house and took a nice walk through the woods and everything was fantastic
i laid back on my friends bed listening to music with everyone and i felt like a million bucks. 
we ended up venturing to a party our friend was having
We had a nice normal conversation but after half my cigarette, my mind felt like it was vacuumed from my body and i was weightless. i saw every memory i had, every regret i had was on my left side and every good memory on my right. i felt, for the first time in my life, pure bliss. 
It seemed to me like i was wandering around in this realm of thoughts and memories for months, the spiraling visuals came back and my vision came back to see myself being carried by two of my friends who i dropped with. they put me in a bed back in the house and i asked, ""how long was i gone?"" they responded, ""maybe 30 seconds man."" 
my mind was blown. i couldn't believe that all of that had passed in my mind over 30
seconds. i remained in my trance for a few hours. in a strange state of consciousness i felt like i never had before. i laid back and listened to music and enjoyed my good vibes for about 3 hours before passing into a deep sleep.

1367133627.0,1d9gca,First time report - strange but good.,KCP100,17,3,5,"So Friday night I decided to try shrooms for the first time. This is actually the first time I have ever done any drug

I ground up my P. Cubes and put them into capsules. I ended up taking a little over an 1/8th with a glass of orange juice on an empty stomach. They went down so quick and smooth with no taste or anything. I never had any nausea or stomach problems either. It did seem to take longer than expected for them to kick in though, but it was just plain incredible to me. I was in bed for most of it, listening to music and staring at my ceiling. I never really got many trippy visuals, which was disappointing. If I looked close enough at textured surfaces they would move a little but no colors changed or anything else incredible. The one visual thing that really amazed me was that I looked over at my lamp just a few feet away, and one of the chains to turn the lights on was swinging back and forth, but the other wasn't. There was nothing that would cause this to happen. I even reached over and stopped it from swinging but as soon as I looked away it was swinging again. Blew my fucking mind. 

After a while I got up and roamed the house in the dark. Everything seemed much bigger. The rooms, but he did for awhile this time. I don't know if he could tell I was tripping or what but he was purring and rubbing on my nonstop. He was acting a bit strange but that might have just been my perception. I don't really know how long this lasted because I had no perception of time. At some point later he did leave though. 

I then starting playing Dolphin Olympics 2 while listening to some music. This was amazing because I was doing surprisingly well at the game. The dolphin seemed to react to the music and was going so much faster than normal. At one point I hit the bottom of the ocean and hurt my dolphin which made me really sad. (If you have not played this game

At this point it was like 3:30 in the morning and I had taken them at 11:30. All I really wanted to do was go to sleep but that couldn't happen yet and I knew it. I ended up just laying in bed for a few more hours thinking about life. It was really nice in a sense but I also could not get comfortable. I was cold and tired and couldn't sleep

Dose- I planned to do a lemon tekked half 1/8 and in a smoothie then wait an hour or two. Feel if I want more

Set/setting- my friends parents are leaving so he has an open house for a few days. He said he'd keep it empty for a while so I can shroom there. He lives by the woods so we can go there to go for nature.
I also want to explore who I am. So i have access to a private room and he said I could chill there. I will have headphones with electronic, great 80's and alternative rock. And when people say they learn about themselves, what mindset are you in? Do you just like zone out in your thoughts?

We went out to long island to do this, where nobody ever goes, so it was a perfect plan. We left his house, distributed the shrooms evenly onto the underside of a frisbee, and we ate the shrooms right in the middle of the street. We each had about 2.3 grams, and walked to the baseball field. We were gonna make the bong, using a gatorade bottle and a trumpet mouthpiece. We got to the baseball field about 10 minutes later, took off our shirts, but everything seemed a bit off, but we immediately started tripping face before we could do it. We started dying laughing and my friend couldn't gather the energy to set up this bong. We started laughing like we never have. I sounded like a little girl screaming

I laid on my back in the grass, like it was swallowing my body. I thought it was the craziest thing. We looked at the 1 or two clouds that were in the sky, and talked about what they looked like. I played with the grass throughout the whole 2 hours. I tore out so much from the dirt. I even ate some. Yea, me and one of my friends were constantly putting random things in our mouths, just because. Pretty weird. At one point, I bit my thumb and thought “wow, I could probably bite my thumb off if I tried, and I didn't think at the time it would matter. But then I realized I was tripping balls and probably shouldnt. We had a few cans of Arnold Palmer, and he couldn't tune it. Instead, was that if someone showed up and spoke to us

We walked off the baseball field casually (or at least I thought it was casually at the time), just to see what it was like. At this point, I had kiiind of started to come down, just enough to not do anything stupid. Still, I was worried one of us would wind up drowning ourselves, so I insisted we stay only knee deep in the water. The water also felt incredible. It was actually freezing, and I would've hated it if I wasn't shrooming, it was just a feeling. A feeling that I was able to notice, but only for about half a second to see what it was like. We then moved back to the sand and lied down in it. We continued our serious bro chat. There was this bug in the sand and we thought about how that sand was the bug's world. While we have streets and neighborhoods that we become familiar with over time, so I helped him out a bit. It sounds silly now

1376385965.0,1k9olq,"3G's, 4 hits of a blunt, Bad trip, Faced my self.",icyomer,3, at 2.25 G's i didnt feel much so i upped the dosage. 2 years ago me and my best friend (we'll call him Z) were completely straight edge. I however started stressing out because of school and in a jokingly manner my friend said if i kept it up id be a pot head by the end of the year. I told him i was considering trying it out

Anyway now we move on to todays trip. My friend ""N"" wanted to chill with us while we we're on shrooms so we obliged. Knowing it took a while to kick in we ate them and then drove about twenty minutes towards him. I had also brought a gallon container of Orange juice because i heard it enhances trips(important to story later). We went into a groccery store near  his neighborhood to avoid the summer heat. While inside I took a piss inside the urinal. After a bit Z looks into the urinal and says ""HOLY SHIT DID YOU JUST PISS ALL THAT"" try as i might he couldnt comprehend that there was water in it before i pissed. The shrooms had begun its effects on him. It took a while longer on me because i am a pretty large guy(170lb, kind of trippy staring into your own eyes, although later i stared at my soul. Anyway we see N and walk towards him, then the giggles land on our face. He asks us how if we're tripping yet and Z says yeah, i say just a case of the giggles.

some other events occur

Eventually we leave and head out to the car. HERE IS WHERE I GO BAT SHIT CRAZY. I start looping. I start realizing things about myself i wish i had never known. For instances, and how i must be messing up N's day since this is the first time in a while we chilled. Then I get terrified that police are coming. So i ask N if he can drive somewhere else. N begins driving. Terribly. I ask him if he's okay to drive and he says yeah. He wasnt. So (i think) we pulled up somewhere. Meanwhile I am bombarded by dry mouth from smoking. Fuck me. 

I say nothing about the dry mouth. I recently started visiting /r/fatpeoplestories and there was a story about how a fat person ruined a bunch of peoples day by continuing to ask for food. I didnt want to be that guy. It was then that i realized i dont browse that subreddit to laugh (although its kinda hilarious) i browse it because i dont want to be the annoying fat guy. So i sit and suffer dry mouth in silence for a bit. Then I make the mistake of trying to lick my the inside of my mouth. It was desert storm in there. It hurt to touch something so dry to another dry part (mad respect to anal porn actors out there). Then it started to effect my breathing. It didnt help that i had a sort throat. I kept asking Z and N if my breathing was normal

Z told me to listen to some music to help the bad trip go away (it helped me last time) but on 3G's the trip was to powerful. N was playing some music on his stereo so i felt like i was insulting him by listening to my head phones. We begin to drive back to my car and i cant help but feel somewhat thankful.

MASS EGODEATH: I start to think about who i am but lose sight of who i am in my mind. Instead i stare at my goals and my actions. I feel like nothing, I work, do drugs and play video games with my friends, and thats all that i am. Thats it. Im not some sort of leader, or anyone with accomplishments. I am drugs,games, and work. Thats it. I felt so empty. I thought of my hobbies to console myself. Drawing and writing are something right? I havent written or drawn in months. What about my goals? I want to be a teacher, im not worthy I thought. Drugs/games/work

I started looping. Im so thirsty. If i ask for something to drink it'll nag everyone and make people feel down. I should say something positive to join in the conversation. I cant breathe or talk right. My mouth is too dry. Im so thirsty. etc. Eventually more problems joined in. I thought to myself ""help me"". But there was no me. Just drugs/games/work. Why was HE(me) working? to move out so he can do drugs freely? So he can play games with his friends? Good job drugs/games/work. I thought about my age

My friend N asks me why Z and I werent hanging with P and B (two other friends) we explained they though we all use to be cool, and douchier. They always wanted to party and we just wanted to chill. Then it hit me. I shouldnt deserve to judge them. All I am is Drugs/games/work, who am I to judge(I met up with them later than night out of guilt to rekindle our friendship, meh not my greatest move but i really feel responsible for who theyve become.)

The looping is getting worse

We finally get to my car and i drink some orange juice (Oh thank fuck). But now im remembering how on/r/fatpeoplestories there was a girl who carried a two liter of Dr. Pepper, but im still going to work on our friendship in the future.

Its been about three days since then. I still havent fully recovered from the egodeath. I know Im more than my actions but now

Honestly I dont know if I'll be okay.

So here's the deal. I have shroomed 2 times in my life. Once when I was 18, but (more or less) I am limited to those two drugs. The first time I shroomed was on a whim freshmen year of college. Sort of anyway. I had been curious about them since high school, but never had the guts to try them. Long story short, I did them (1.6g species unknown), and had one hell of a time. I did it on my door floor, told pretty much everyone I knew what I was doing while I was on them. I was able to find people to be around, and also isolate just as I wanted. So much body high and overall silliness. It overall was a great experience, but I was alright.

I couldn't find them again (I was not looking hard) until I was 22. I had wanted to do them again since I first did them, they'd work themselves out. Bad idea. Long story short for this, I did them (3.1g unknown species), controlled my behavior WAY too much cause I am too good at doing that. ALL emotion left me (goodbye happiness, so long fear), and I became 100% suicidal with no fear of death. Nothing mattered at all. My thoughts were pretty much ""Death? Meh. Let's give that a shot."" The only thing that kept me alive, is I was able to remember my sober self that said ""no, don't do that"". I knew to listen to that. I crashed mildly once I came down. I cried in my moms arms professing how profoundly lonely I was, that it was just wrong for me. Despite the fact that I very much want to explore hallucinogens. I didn't like that conclusion

That was almost 2 years ago now, and have been depressed for a few years now. I am fearful that if I do them, it might make things WORSE, or dangerous. This time I'd make sure to do it in an environment where I would feel free. The only problem is there is a variable I'd want that I can't control.

I am lonely. Really, and I still can't find one, and trust me I am trying. I am the kind of guy who loves sharing experiences. It's very important to me. I fear that if I do shrooms, I might be like ""this is great! but... I am alone"", and cue the downward spiral. As much as I love and need my alone time, and I very well could enjoy a solo trip SO much, I fear I'll get absolutely bombarded with loneliness

Ultimately, or profound, or fulfilling. Something positive. Not too much to ask, right?

Given the above circumstances, I want the answer to be yes, I want validation. Ultimately, what I need though is the truth.

At first I didn't really worry about this because overall I'm a happy person, and I don't really have any anxiety, stress, or  depression problems at all. But the more and more I hear about bad trips, and how you wanna avoid them at all costs makes me slightly nervous. Last thing I wanna do is be stuck in a nightmare for 5+ hours.

How long does it last? If theres anything that MAY make me anxious/stressed/nervous if I feel stuck in the trip. Also If I start thinking about homework. I have a few big exams coming up next week but still decided to dedicate all day tomorrow to this. Depending on when I come down I may even be able to study at night.

Last question. What are some fun things to do? Were all university students in Philadelphia We were just gonna hang out at the apartment for half the trip, watch movies etc. We were also thinking about walking around campus or going to pick up dinner. Even go to fairmount park. Any suggestions in this matter?

So yesterday I got a bit careless. A friend of mine had grown cubensis from one of those

Anyway

In my opinion it really was too late to start shrooming at 9:15 PM (or 21:15 as we say in Europe)

As I had left my pocket scale at home I was pretty much guessing how much it was. About two weeks ago three of us had tried about 15 g + about 10 g (second dose not weighted but close to same ammount) an hour later of fresh ones; that was a little less then half I thought so splitting the rest between the two of us would land us at 4-5 maybe 6 grams which I considered reasonable considering I barely felt anything the first time.

I later got to know that in those bag were probably somewhere between 12-15 grams dried cubensis each. I felt a bit bad after hearing that since it was my friends first psychadelic trip

Anyway, it's amazing really.

Then once we get inside the trip turns to the worse. I figure I should turn on some music but I can't think of any. I first turn on shpongle but it creeps me out and then some kashiwa daisuke but it too creeped me out. At this point I really couldn't figure out how to work my computer to I just paused the music and left it be. I started getting a belly ache from the shrooms and lie down feeling as if I've got a fever. My friend is laughing hysterically looking at his own hands and the whole room is starting to swing around. Thinking about it afterwards this probably would've been an awesome experience had it not been for the belly ache.

I go to the toilet trying to puke

I start looking around the dirty toilet thinking things like ""well

I go to my room mate (not the one tripping with me

So I hold on to her and I'm almost crying. I knew that the mushrooms aren't really dangerous in the sense that they can kill me and I know I'm quite safe from schizofrenia and things like that (judging from my family history), being careless with the dosing. I could feel his prescence much stronger than at any other of my trips and I could feel him wanting to destroy me.

As I held on to my room mate there was like a storm going through my head and the god tried to pull me out of reality in to another, then I would open up my eyes and reattach myself to reality. Even with my eyes open I could see very pretty, though frightening at the time, psychedelic patterns in the room. They were coming on and of like some sort of radio jitter.

Even though I was suffering through this trip I can still remember my room mate, that'd just ruin it"".

After a while my stomach ache calmed down and the trip took a more pleasant turn. I couldn't quite enjoy it as much because of what happened before this

----------

Well, though I'll be much more careful in the future. I also think, having felt as if I've been on the brink of insanity, I might learn to appreciate life and soberness more for what it is. I will still use drugs, psychedelics in particular because they teach me these things, but maybe a bit more carefully.

What do you think? Anyone ever done something similar?

So... I usually use trees

So we chilled out in a room and ate them with lemonade. I was told that they are awful, and they got stuck in my teeth.

We smoked a couple of bowls and relaxed for about an hour

suddenly, warriors, tidal waves, a whole art show in one tub of peanut butter.

at about that time, but the music stopped when I went inside, like I was leaving the world. We did eventually go in, and that's when the crazy stuff started happening. I felt the need to go into the bathroom, turn off the lights, and rest in the tub, but I saw dead people and writhing monsters in my mind. strangely, I wasn't scared

My Ego drew me to my friends for more entertainment and I found them in one of their rooms (we all live together) listening to techno in the dark watching Gordon Ramsay prepare food. The music matched with the show perfectly. My fiance was on the floor commenting about how she needs to feel better about herself and make comic strips

Suddenly i felt a twang

After my friends left, the third friend found me and we went into her room with her boyfriend, smoked some trees, and chilled out, as I had become a snail. The beanbag was now my shell.

I got lonely for my fiance, but she had to pee and my second friend took the beanbag!

""Pillow you whore!"" I shouted (mind you, but it was to no avail. the pillow was his now. We watched some music videos, including something called post-rap, and some angry music, which was really cool. Then I played the [Pucca song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb946g2yOig) (it's one of the happiest songs ever). We all loved it. at that time, they got tired so my fiance went into our room, ordered pizza, but it is all I remember.

We had put together like $80 bucks or something and bought 4 Peanut Butter and Chocolate shroom cups, the chocolates tasted so bad that I could barely stomach them and nearly puked with each bite, but I suffered through them (oddly enough the guy who only had 1 was the only of us who actually liked them. Us and our sitter then sat around in my friend's house for like an hour playing guitar hero and just relaxing. At the time I didn't feel anything, aside from wanting to throw up, but as time went on I started feeling slightly more happy and a few colors would be more vibrant than before. Both my friends felt the effects before myself as they began to just run around and just have a fun time but I still felt relatively normal.
After about 2 hours I and the friend who's house we were at decided that we felt relatively normal and wanted to go smoke a bowl to see how we felt after that

During our time in the car we spent maybe 5 minutes out of 30+ smoking, but we were starting to peak actually and we spent our time in the car going on about how much we mean to each other as friends, and how the 3 of us are like family to each other, and other such things. After our sitter checked in on us a few times we headed back indoors.

Earlier in the night we had set up a really cool lamp that had 5 small lamps on it, and how cool it was. Then Friend 1 (guy who's house we were at) was going on about how cool the blue one was even though it didn't work, and then while explaining this he moved it to stand straight up and compare it to our sitter and how he watched over us when suddenly it turned on. This, as simple as it was, was utter fascinating and mindblowing to the three of us and we sat there laughing and in awe. And then friend 1 was waving his arms around and accidentally hit the not working lamp with his arm as the blue went out and it turned back on.

Most of the night continued with shenanigans

I've got to admit that shrooms were nothing like what I expected, but I will never regret it either, ever subtle change feels for the better.

He weighed the least. Lets just call my friends S and the other A (A is the one who this whole ordeal happened too)

*Scroll all the way down for a shorter version

In the beginning, our pupils started to dilate. Nothing was really wrong and we seemed like we were about to have a good time. About 25 minutes in, we started seeing the floor breathe and it was pretty cool. I remember my friend A saying: ""I feel like I should be in a hospital bed"" which was obviously weird for him to say, but we discredited it as a joke. He started acting kind of weird, not willing to explore the house with me and S and just sat in the couch with 2 other people who were just drinking and playing cards and another person who was ""babysitting"" us on our first experience. After about 10 more minutes, me and S go into his mother's bedroom to look at ourselves in the mirror; we looked beautiful. A comes in the room and says he needs to lay down and he keeps asking me if the effects go away if he just sleeps but I tell him no. I start to get a little worried about him as I see he is not really enjoying it and he's starting to think the trip is going to get bad (If you think it, it will happen) but I try not to make it bother me because I really felt already I was fighting for my sanity as it kicked more and more in (If one bad thought took over my mind, just lay in the bed for 10 minutes and close your eyes and calm down and then come talk to us. He did so and me and S decide to go to the basement while our friend who is babysitting us (lets call him P) said he would check on him in 10 minutes. Meanwhile me and S were in the basement, my A friend takes the scissors and thrusts them as hard as he can in his chest and makes a weird grunting noise and my friend P stops him and takes the scissors and removes all sharp objects(please note that I was not aware of this happening as I was downstairs) and asks him why he did it to which he replied ""I need to die. I need to have sex right now. P, that early"" --- This is the last thing that he said that night that made sense. Two seconds after


*Short version*
I just held down one if my best friends down on the floor in a pool of blood as he was fighting my friends like a wild animal because he was trying to kill himself. he jumped through a window (he didn't open the window, cutting himself all over with glass then trying to stab himself with scissors and then he tried to get me to have sex with him. He said he couldn't feel anything. drugs. The actual experience of this is 100 worse than you think it was. thankfully we had great people there come help and strap him down in the car and drive him to the hospital. i talked to his step family and we both realized that he has major psychological issues that we never realized until now. however, he is now safe and just got released from the ER.

I had an amazing experience in the forests of northern Arizona last weekend and would like to share a small bit. I was up there with my girl and part of her family to spread the ashes of her recently deceased grandparents. We arrived Saturday mid-day and I started drinking some beers while my girl was drinking some Jack/Coke's. After we got camp setup everyone was drinking, accepted. About 30 minutes later, I was feeling pretty high on life and that's when I was offered shrooms.

One of her family members busted out a Tupperware container about 75% full of this magical fungi. Her and I (her first time doing shrooms and my second) both took decent size handfuls and munched them then washed them down with some H2O. This was around 5 pm. I would say they took about 20 minutes for me to start feeling them. It first started with a very light feeling. It felt as if my head and body weighed a lot less than it actually did. It felt great!!! 30-40 mins into the beginning stages of the trip my girl and I decide to walk the forest. We spent the next 2 hours looking at some of the most amazing images I have ever seen in my lifetime and giggling our asses off!!! I has so much fun. The trees were moving in unison beautifully. The forest ground was bright green from the grass, and the sky was beginning to turn orange and pink from the sunset. I stood in amazement as I tried to take all of this in. I would get lost looking at the trunk of an old tree that had fallen many years before and hear my girl call me to look at some pretty caterpillar.

I would look at something and just let my mind wander and do what it does and I would lose myself in the most peaceful way ever. I couldn't sit still, I did not see many mushrooms in it. Yes, I looked, don't judge me.

After her and I got back to camp food was ready, staying away from non-tripping people was haha.. Their laughter / shit-talking to each other and drunkenness made it  a hard environment to put myself into. So we stood at the front of her truck laughing, talking about how we were feeling, what we were seeing and all that good stuff. I am pretty positive we saw Mars and Venus in the night sky, there were 2 VERY bright ""stars"" that were red and vibrant. I stared at the starts for at least an hour. She said she couldn't look up anymore because she was getting cold, lol her hoodie kept falling off when she looked up is all. We saw a satellite zoom across the star filled night sky, that was pretty amazing. We finally went to bed around 10:30.

Before we crashed out I had to poo... So I take my flashlight and make the trek to our makeshift shitter in the wood. I came equipped with a .45 ACP handgun because of uhm, made it back to the tent and washed my hands then proceeded to sleep for about 7 hours. I woke up in the AM feeling great, no hangover, no weird dreams, had a great day after that.

Her family member that offered them is having a birthday party tomorrow the 1st, she did too :) Thanks for reading this! I just want to add a little something for people out there to relate to and share my experience.",,False,self,t5_2qszq,False,,

You'll notice some of them a crushed a bit. After picking them I put them in my pocket and went to herd cattle (seriously). That's why they got smushed. 

Now according to [this](http://www.shroomery.org/8461/Which-psilocybin-mushrooms-grow-wild-in-my-area) the mushrooms that grow wild in my area are:

#

* Gymnopilus junonius

* Panaeolus cinctulus

* Panaeolus cyanescens

* Psilocybe caerulescens

* Psilocybe cubensis

I looked up pictures of these for comparison, who knows?

I have some experience with booms and have been around many friends who have also done them and offered to hang out while he and another friend tried them. They each took an eighth and starting feeling the effects pretty quickly so I offered to drive them up a nearby canyon and to a lookout spot. Everything seemed fine and they were enjoying themselves and after about two hours we were back at my house. At this point I could tell they were fairly anxious about when the trip would be ending and so I decided to watch some TV to help them get their minds off of it. The first friend decided to stay in my room. After about five minutes of watching Regular Show with the second friend the friend in my room walked across the room and headed upstairs without a word. This was at almost three hours after ingestion. My second friend followed him up and immediately returned saying he was fine. I thought he had headed out to get some cold air but followed him just to make sure. By this time he was already in his car. I chased after him but to no avail. Immediately I texted him and called him but no answer. I went back downstairs and found his coat and shoes. After another friend joined us we went and checked out his house to make sure he had gotten home safely and his car was there so we figured there wasn't much we could do at this point. Worst case he had run into his parents. We got back to my house again and found his phone behind a chair in my room. Soon after we got a call from his parents on his phone and found out what had happened. He had gone home

After talking to him recently he said the last thing he remembered was driving back to my house and then later laying at his house thinking he was dead. Most of the night he remembers nothing about...complete blackout.

You know what we discovered?  It’s mostly empty space.  To provide perspective

I feel we can drill down as long as we’d like

I believe the language we use when describing events is a key to finding connectivity when there is none apparent.  Using the same word to describe both events and sensation is the key, yes, yes.

Vibration is used to describe a feeling of motion we feel physically.  It is also used to describe a state of being of an object, i.e. “He/She had a bad/good vibe.”  Closely related and worth consideration for addition to this thought ball, “We are on the same/different wavelengths”, “I’m feeling your vibe”, “[Take the action] and ride the wave”, “I’m buzzed”, “Raise your vibration”

Nearly every sense you use as a human to build your picture of the world around you makes use of incoming waves.  Light waves for sight, the electrons that compose you and the electrons that compose the matter repel each other).  Smell is based on the receipt of aromatic particles that are themselves vibrating.

In our biosphere, and that is how they navigate home.   Elephants are able to communicate across miles using ultra low frequency, sound waves which we cannot hear.

One of the most recent discoveries that astounds me most is one that I saw in the documentary, or a ‘frequency’.  If you imagine the earth as one sphere and the ionosphere as another sphere and calculate the tension between the two, you arrive at a frequency.  10 Hertz.  This is a measurable frequency which surrounds life on earth.  Are you ready for the 2×4 to the face?  Your alpha brain waves also are measured at 10 hertz.

Ok, there is a lot of data in terms of waves that are constantly interacting with our bodies, and we only really consciously perceive a fraction of the input.  What does this have to do with tripping and emergent properties of reality?

Have you ever been under the influence of a psychedelic and have seen the walls breathing, if you’ve taken psychedelics and haven’t seen these things you haven’t taken enough. This is a standard occurrence of my trips, and most trip reports I’ve read or heard.  So what’s it about?  If Psilocin was causing an ‘error’ as critics portray, then why is it exactly the same error for so many?  I thought it was just one more thing about the psychedelic experience that was far from being understood, and who knows when a brilliant scientist will find this specific answer.

Then I saw this Ted Talk: http://www.ted.com/talks/aaron_o_connell_making_sense_of_a_visible_quantum_object.html

Aaron O’Connell, super-cool the metal, remove all light, and still measure the metals movement.  It turns out that when all stimuli (photons, heat, other partials and gasses) were removed, the object began to MOVE!  “In weird ways” he says.  “It wasn’t sitting perfectly still

WHOAH!  I jumped immediately to, and psychedelics let you see that.  I even made that statement to a friend who told me that I was crazy, there was no proof, and you better not say that again to other people.  Challenge accepted to at least try to make someone want to design a test for this.

I propose for the collective unconscious to work on the following idea:  Psychedelics allow an individual to consciously process more of the sensory input which we receive every day and in every way. The increase in consciousness is the result of the molecular displacement of the neurotransmitter serotonin by the neurotransmitter psilocin

A lofty thing to try to prove.  Well, which passes the blood brain barrier and interacts directly with the 5HT2A receptor neurons which normally operate using the neurotransmitter serotonin.

If you look at a psilocin molecule and a serotonin molecule side by side


Serotonin in the brain (5HT Receptor Sites)

“The neurons of the raphe nuclei are the principal source of  5-HT release in the brain.[67] There are 7 or 8 raphe nuclei (some scientists chose to group the raphe linearis nuclei into one nucleus), reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the cerebellum and spinal cord, while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.”

It seems as though the 5HT family is responsible for a lot of stuff.  Let’s drill down into the emergent property.  Notice above that the nuclei responsible for the 5HT interactions are “Centered around the reticular formation”.  Form and function in human anatomy are closely related.  Let’s see where this takes us.

The Reticular Formation

“The reticular formation is a region in the brainstem that is involved in multiple tasks such as regulating the sleep-wake cycle and filtering incoming stimuli to discriminate irrelevant background stimuli.[1] It is essential for governing some of the basic functions of higher organisms

Notice!  “Filtering incoming stimuli”   The reticular formation

“The reticular formation consists of more than 100 small neural networks

    Somatic motor control – Some motor neurons send their axons to the reticular formation nuclei, and posture–especially during body movements. The reticular formation also relays eye and ear signals to the cerebellum so that the cerebellum can integrate visual, auditory, and vestibular stimuli in motor coordination. Other motor nuclei include gaze centers, which enable the eyes to track and fixate objects, and central pattern generators, which produce rhythmic signals to the muscles of breathing and swallowing.”

Notice! “relays eye and ear signals to the cerebellum so that the cerebellum can integrate visual

Serotonin gets to choose what makes it in for processing!

“4. Sleep and consciousness – The reticular formation has projections to the thalamus and cerebral cortex that allow it to exert some control over which sensory signals reach the cerebrum and come to our conscious attention.”

Notice! “that allow it to exert some control over which sensory signals reach the cerebrum and come to our conscious attention.”

“5. Habituation – This is a process in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive

Notice!  Above!  :) …ignore repetitive meaningless stimuli – like the constant vibration of all matter around us?

I propose that the way psilocin and serotonin function as neurotransmitters can be compared to frame rate for video speed.   We’re talking about optics (breathing walls, walls appear stable and solid, although we know this is not true about the quantum universes that comprise that wall.  Imagine you changed the filter to allow more data to pass and increased the processing frame rate.  On a quantum level, the molecules in the wall, every single one of them, is “breathing” as Allen O’Conner so perfectly put it to make this leap of thought.   Just incredibly fast.

I think, but the point is, you would be seeing more about the true nature.  The faster you speed up the information processing, the more you see about the truth.

In a study conducted by Dr. Roland Fischer in the 1970’s at John’s Hopkins University

Dr. Fischer was quoted by Terence Mckenna as saying “So here you have the proof that a drug can show you a truer picture of reality”!

Since all of matter is vibratory in nature

We met up at a friends house at around seven and looked our shrooms over. I think it was a bunch of liberty but really I have no idea.
There were only about 60 in the bags out of the 100 we thought we had bought so we split and ate them anyway.
We called a friend of ours who had more shrooms at his place and we went there and ate a bunch more and something he said were some mexican shrooms.

Then we left his place and thats about 40 minutes after ingesting. 
We were wondering if we still hadn't eaten enough so we decided to go buy some dominos. That it where it started kicking in.
Everything was hilarious. Our sober buddy went in and we tried walking in but had to leave because of uncontrollable fits of laughter.

We went to my friends place and started eating the pizza. It seemed like it took freaking weeks. Time literally stopped.
After a few weeks of pizza we all sat down in the couch and watched a painting for about 40 minutes. It was beautiful. The moving, wall seemed to move backwards and the house in general was as if it was breathing.
I also noticed how I found dimensions and space between things to be much larger. Like my friends staircase was never that wide before and all kinds of things.
After watching the painting I went downstairs to my friends room. I looked up from his bed and stared at a light bulb for a few minutes and enjoyed the calming visuals and deep thinking.
I had been thinking that entire night, and if I had just never given myself time to realize it.
By looking at the bulb I felt an immense realization that...
Its very hard to explain but the closest is something like ""Everything is far more complex than we will ever know unless we give ourselves time to deeply inspect and contemplate those things"". 
An intense feeling of calm and serenity then followed. I went to sleep last night with an intense feeling of everything being in its place.   
For me it was amazing. I will do this again sometime.

Oh and also. Friend of mine had that thingy where he wobbled around a bit before limping down. Thought he was dying.
Can anyone explain that? He ate loads of the mexican stuff.

TL;DR = Ate shrooms

------------


started this trip maybe like 30 minutes ago.  I mean that's when i took the pill.  Right now, but the plac ehooks me up like crazy.  Im still so lazy though for some reason.... maybe just cuz i love drugs so much

a yways what i was going to say a bit ago was that i have tons of visuals going on.... like fucking weird whirly things happening in 3d.... my eyes are open though and the visuals are happening between this and the computer screen.  They are mostly red and green though

Oh i should put this as a field report later on.  Shit

i should also put some music on..

oh man this orange juice is so good right now... very like... antsy and jittery and dancing around sort of... but not like coke.  Coke has too much jitters but gets you going.  This gets you going without of the shitty jitters... sort of like X in that respect


im really fucking digging these tunes right now though.... some old school trance right now... i'm usually more into deeper stuff though... minimal/tech/progressive house

am i becoming a drug addict dude?  Maybe i am... ive been blowing off friends more to just get stoned at home (or just tired from being stoned).  But the thing is before, with and without other people.  I wish that things had worked out between me and my ex girlfriend... but she would have never have tried anything like this.  So really, what i wanted was an ideal version of her that she didn't want to be.  I wanted her to be this beautiful, cool, smart, awesome girl, that loves to party all the time... which is obviously why we got toeher in the first place.  At first it was incredible... i was always with her and we loved spending time with each other and fucking all the time... i got her to do some shit for the first time that she hadn't done before

some more modern deep house shit came on and i am grooving out hard.... visuals are still going.... greens and reds.... alsmost like confetti around.  Good times!  I think the volume is up too loud (but my speakers are phenomenal... i dont fuck around... check out the e design audio lineup).  Cheap and fucking sick as hell dude... i recommend tha shit to anyone... i fucking love that company.  I should talk to them and tell them that im interested in them.... fuck thats a good idea.  In fact

Update on... fuck i forgot what i was talking about

dude but fucking music is so awesome... i totally forgot abotu some of these tracks!  I dont get why people dont have better speakers.... most poeple dont care and they listen to fucking

oh yea... update on the visuals... now its making faint like 3d sperical/animal shaped sort of... can't explain it.

Oh yea i sholud totally contact other companies that i think are awesome and maybe i can help them with something cuz i think they do fucking great work..... unlike goddamn my company which i dont give a shit at all about.  I dont give a flying fuck about it, but i know that i can get away with it 

i wish i knew the exact amount of shrooms i took .... i have no fucking idea


i just totally forgot what i was thinking about but my mind is going a fucking mile a minute.  I keep listening to old songs i've forgotten about and they are fcuking awesome.  Visuals are like red and green weird things, some viauslas have like weird hebrew fucking words on them sort of... obviously i have no idea what it says .  My mind is just going so fast, and i can't record the shit in my mind as fast as it comes... my ideas like come about then disappear instantly.  Its really fucking weird.  Im definitely tripping harder than i was the first time... but maybe not.... the visuals are more intense this time but i dont feel like i want to get up as much

now the computer is like morphing into weird shit kind of

anyways lets fucking have a good time... the boring roommate that is going to ruin our time is not here (i hope he doesn't show up cuz he will find fucking so many drugs and hopefully strippers here in a while)  i want the strippers to have a good time... not necessarily fuck me... lets just fucking party and have a good time... not just like wham bam thank you maaam.... i want to keep getting all these thoughts down

the fucking words and shit are moving around on the screen.... fuck the volume is too loud again.  I think i may have taken a good amount so far.... i just hope it doesn't last too long where i can't get to sleep and fuck up work in temorning.  Anyways

Fuck i had so much i wanted to write about while going piss but i forgot all of them... i can't fucking type fast enough jesus christ motherfucker ass dick

some fucking pussy would be legit right now dude... i have the beats for it.... i want some fucking strippers but not the wham bam thnk you maam fucking dirty ones that just get done and fucking, this music is totally boss and i dont know how long this will last but it is awesome as fuck for the time being.... i am thoroughly enjoying myself.  Happy times for all.... i dont even know if i would want to be with other people right now.... i dotn even know if i could talk at this point.... i just want to be in my own zone and shit.  Just typing away, not giving a shit about spelling.  Just my fucking stream of consciousness and this music.  I want to dance, but whenever i move the visuals go away.... if i stay still and look at the screen, then slowly the visuals come back in..... but fuck it im dancing anyways.  Ok so is it going to be that much work to get strippers here.... dude i am a good ass typer, and i dont even realize how valuable of a skill that is... i am damn fucking good at this... my dad still hunts and pecks dude.... i think i can type faster than human speech... actually thats probably not true, but it is definitley closer to true if im typing like this without caing arout errors and shit, this fucking music is legit right now.  Lots of visualizations with this deep house music... i want the music louder, then other times im just like

it was the mushrooms. i felt poisoned soon after i took them. and then every single sound i heard echoed and boomed and completely engulfed me. i tried to explain to my GF that she couldn't speak because i couldn't take the explosions of stimuli. we went for a walk hoping that being outdoors would help. it didn't. 

an hour passes. and with it every emotion a human is capable of feeling erupted from me and landed at the feet of my friends. love, melancholy. i found myself in one point crying, staring, babbling at a painting of a chair my GF had done.

A group of 10 friends drove up to Big Sur this weekend planning to take shrooms. It’s my fifth time shrooming

We all ate them at the campsite in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and went to explore the creek. After about half an hour some people had everything catch their eye, including me.

I noticed I couldn’t quite get comfortable anywhere, and after a little bit more exploring, (shoes are off at this point, and most of us are just walking through the stream) I see her try to explain that she can see these three orbs and she was in one of them, when one person started laughing. He had the giggles.

So she gets up, giving her space. As I’m trudging through the water, I come around and bend and see her, up ahead, sitting on a rock underneath the light. It was beautiful. She stood up and told me to go but I had to tell her how beautiful this was. She looked like a queen.

So I come over to her, and that there’s this presence holding them together, telling her everything’s going to be okay. And I assure her it is, and she starts to cry. They’re good tears though. It was like someone turned on all of the faucets inside of her and it was all flowing out of her into the stream. And we hugged. Also, I remember her pair of eyelids looked like individual bottom lids, and so it looked like she had four eyes.

She went on to tell me the presence was Ra, and that these emotions were coming in waves.

And then people came. And I hated it, but they didn’t get it. They weren’t on that same wavelength. And she felt it too. She hasn’t moved from the rock since we hugged about two hours before.

Eventually everyone left but one person and we all talked about roller coasters and space babies, and the trip was over. Just like that.

The only drugs I've ever done in my life is weed and shrooms. 
Only smoked a handful times
Friday night me and my best friend went round a friends apartment to try some shrooms to celebrate finishing school. 
We got there

We proceeded to eat them. My friend (who does psychedelic drugs but never shrooms) ate 2 grams off the bat. I wanted to have a slow come up so I have 0.4 grams. Around 30mins later I wanted more, so I just thought ""That looks cool, back to my phone"" So I went back on my phone to proceed to play mario. After 30 seconds of playing mario I was giggling too much to concentrate on the game, certain features of the game were emphasized then put into very high contrast along with yellow cross's that appeared around anything of significance on the game, e.g a mushroom enemy or brick. At this point I knew I was tripping balls, still really happy and enjoying myself. A few hours past and my friend still had no visuals just was really happy, at this point we had 1 1/2 grams left of our original 7 grams. It came to 6am and our hosts wanted to go to sleep, we felt it was time to leave as my friends sister wanted to get picked up from a friends house after having a bad trip (everyone at the house was on the same drug and/or mdma). Once we got their my friend deiceded to stay there for 30mins as they were good friends. I did not like this part. I was sat on a hard floor listening to VERY loud drum and bass with people who I did not feel comfortable and jailbait snorting mdma off a CD case next to me. My friend was cool as he is used too this scene and I am not. It is obvious from where I am sitting why my friends sister had a bad trip and it looked like all she wanted to do was to go home and cry. As did I, I had told him I don't feel comfortable tripping in that house and I didn't want to leave. As we hadn't sleep properly I would advise just get another hours worth or so sleep before going anywhere. Of course he did not listen ""I just want to go out, I found myself with little to no effort to do anything whatsoever. I wanted to sleep

1352645685.0,130e7h,First time last night - strange/good but will not do again.,greentab,10,2,7,"Made some shroom tea with 2g last night. My bf was my trip sitter. I started feeling a little buzz pretty quickly within about 20 min. About an hour later the effects kinda hit me all at once. My hand started feeling tingly and like it wasn't a part of me. I started freaking out a little and it felt like I had a huge weight on my chest. Eventually I calmed down after listening to some music.

I went into the kitchen to get a snack and was eating slices of pickles. I looked down at the half eaten pickle I'm holding and I just start laughing hysterically to the point that I'm crying but then the crying turned into sadness and I started crying for real. I had to tell my bf to take the pickle from me cause I didn't want to let go of it. It was so strange how my emotions were all over the place. I just wanted to feel normal so I put Curb Your Enthusiasm on and we watched that for a while. 

At about the 2 hour mark was when the effects were peaking. I turned off the show and plugged my comp into the tv. I played songs over winamp with the visualizations tab open and that was extremely awesome. Watching the colors with the music was mesmerizing and made me feel really good inside. It was like I was on the verge of orgasm the whole time while watching it. 

I look down and see something on my shirt and freak out for a second but my bf says its just a fuzz so I pick it off and drop it to the floor while saying ""I don't even know what that is"". As soon as I said that I started crying again because it really bothered me that I didn't even know what that was and I just threw it away like it was nothing....without even trying to figure it out or looking at it first. I didn't give it a chance and just threw it away. 

I looked at my hand and it looked 3-D - like how you would see a 3-D drawing on paper. I flattened my hand parallel to the floor pointing away from me so when I looked at it

When I got up and walked around I felt really short like I was closer to the floor than usual. When I walked into a different room the ceiling seemed really close to my head. My hands started feeling really weak like I couldn't control them that well to grab things. I felt kinda like a crab using claws. If I started laughing really hard at something I would start to cry so I had to make sure I didn't laugh too hard.

After about 3 hours the effects started to fade and I was back to just the small buzz feeling. About an hour after that I was so tired that I had to go to bed. It was an interesting experience. The times I felt really good I could feel it throughout my whole body and the happiness was intense in every part of me. But I didn't like how a small thing like picking a fuzz off my shirt could send me into questioning myself and who I am. The emotional swings were unpredictable and came out of nowhere from unsuspecting sources triggering them.

Yesterday, small shroom before going out to meet with a larger group of friends. Dry weight was around 0.15g. 

Since this is well below the expected threshold dose, since I met with non-psychedelic friends, but once I realised that the effects weren't getting stronger, and I felt comfortable on the plateau I started having a really good time.

I had some great conversations, and I'm fairly certain that the fact I was mildly tripping  contributed to this.

So I'd like to hear your answers on a couple of questions I have regarding very low dose trips:

1. Did you ever have a memorable experience triggered by low dose shrooms? What was the dose? What happened?
2. Do you think that frequent low dose trips are a bad idea? I feel that mushies are very powerful substances, or somehow do psychological harm to myself in ways that may only become apparent when its too late.
3. I have the impression that the fact I was mildly tripping transformed the dynamic of our group of 10 people in a positive way

----

Four of us took 2g each

Sitting down for dinner 15 minutes later my legs were a bit wobbly and my stomach was starting to churn.  Having a cast-iron stomach that can handle anything I powered through

As others migrated into the lounge to join us we changed the music to a more chilled playlist and waited out the gutwrenching feeling which took probably another 30 minutes.  This was a strange period of time because you had to walk a fine line between talking

----

**What followed this was the most exciting

It was a state of conciousness that is extremely hard to describe

On top of that I experienced **a bond with my partner and the other couple that is even harder to describe**.  We felt as if we were one conciousness

**Music played a massive part in dictating the mood of us all** - whether we were energetic or lethargic, energy and inspiration.  Next time I'll take more care in building a better playlist to experience with different styles of music.

**It seemed as if we had the memory of a goldfish**, get some socks, go to the toilet) it would take forever to just decide to do it and then even longer to accomplish it.  As soon as I walked into my room I questioned if it was the right room, then rummaging through my bag for socks I freaked out that it wasn't my bag.  I persevered through it and completed my quest, much to everyone's amusement.  It then took my girlfriend a good 45 minutes to put her socks on as we all kept getting distracted.

At the peak I was so high **it felt like my conciousness left my body and I didn't have full control of my limbs**.  Someone would pass me a joint or glass of wine (both of which we held all night but never really consumed) and my arms were brand new to me.  They just wouldn't work well

----

**Some other highlights I can expand on if people are interested**

* Chucking a piss released a huge sense of accomplishment
* Controlling any electronics was nearly impossible
* Photos of people would vibrate at me as if they were trying to talk or laugh
* Cricket constantly being a way of grounding ourself before things got out of control
* Changing rooms and being mesmerised by the kitchen floor tiles
* Having a revelation and near spriritual connection with of one the friends' dog

**I have a few questions also

* No one hallucinated past some pulsating
* Someone heard that any more shrooms won't work again until 10 days later as our body has built up a tolerance - is this true?  When we were coming down we had 2 more to try get back up but it didn't seem to do anything.
* What kind of activities do you do?  We seemed to just sit on a couch and have the time of our life for 4-5 hours.

I ground them up in a blender, added it to very warm water, about 120 degrees F for 45 minutes with a squeeze of lemon and a squirt of honey. I drank the tea and all i got was nausea, a heavy feeling, and giggles. No visuals, no color enhancement. No wider music. No euphoria.  As you can see I did everything to oreserve potency, cool brewing and eating them 4 days after picking. 
Any idea what went wrong? I have read that 2g should be enough for a good firat trip. Should i eat more next time
Set and setting was my house by myself. Any advice would be appreciated. I am harvesting anither batch soon and would like the next time to be better.

1373309047.0,1hvpfn,Tripped balls this weekend,howdoesthisworkfuck,9,5,2,"*I had not anticipated this being such a long story

Figured you guys would enjoy this story. Over the weekend me and my girl took the largest dose of shrooms either of us has ever dealt with before. Both of us enjoy our weed, and boy do they mean it.

First some back story. We have tripped a total of 3 times prior to this. Our first attempt, and it was a truly magical experience. 

Next, but didnt ""go anywhere"".

Finally

We put the 1/4oz into chocolates, almost 2gs in each half.

So we each took a half bar and waited about an hour and a half. You could start feeling them kick in and it was really nice

So I made my first mistake of the night.. we both took the other halfs of the bars. We put on a movie to watch while they kicked in (wreck it ralph!) and started to chill out. 

About 20min later... holy fucking shit balls. The ""comeup"" anxiety was unreal and the potency was stronger than anything i've ever experienced in my life. It came on so sudden and strong that it freaking my girl out bad. For about 15min I was chasing her around the house trying to calm her down as it was scaring the hell out of her. 

In the meantime, but it only lasted about 15minutes.

15 min pass and I finally get her to settle down on the couch. I put on some music and we just sit there for a few. After about 3 minutes sitting there, and amazing all at the same time.

I noticed it before she did, we both look at each other and just start burst out laughing for a good 10-15min laughing fit. We then start laughing about how crazy we were not even 15min ago, and what the fuck just happened.

After we got past the come up, and she loved being around us during it. We played with glow sticks, and strobe lights, listened to music, rolled around on the floor with blankets and pillows. It was like being a kid again.

It was truly a great experience

The way we described it, everything that makes you ""you"" is dissolved when you trip that hard, and the great experience was being able to rebuild who you are from the ground up, without all the nonsense. It felt like such a mental flush afterwards.

The very first thing I noticed was about 15 minutes after ingestion, I wobbled over to him as gravity pulled me towards the walls.

B was calmly writhing on the floor repeating the words “fitzgerald”, he told me he was trying to remember the name of a place so he started making a list of everything (because the place had to be on a list of everything) but those were the only 3 things he could think of.

I now decided to listen to some music ([Thriftworks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2TV_YXma2E) of course, among countless indescribable others.

I stumbled into the kitchen and spied an apple even though I didn’t feel hungry. After taking a single bite I looked at it and realized I’d eaten the whole thing. The next hour is a blur

At this point B was functioning a bit more normally, then walked to the washroom and ran back backwards without even washing my hands. He thought this was hilarious so he started laughing and I tried to ask him what was so funny but it sounded like my voice was 4x too slow so I started laughing uncontrollably as well. 

Suddenly we were upstairs in my room discussing the problems with society but I found it hard to pay attention to the conversation because my voice was still in slow motion

I felt like I wanted to draw something now so I got out my notebook and started writing down numbers. I managed to reach 21 but then repeated it four times by accident and drew some simple fractals instead
It was now hour 4 and we were starting to come down. I felt an incredible amount of energy but the visuals had mostly gone and according to B I was having a lot of trouble forming proper sentences.

1363470712.0,1afi5q,Just wanted to share my (successful) first experience,twlife10,6,2,1,"Hey Reddit. I tripped for the first time 3 weeks ago. It was an extremely positive experience and I wanted to share it with you. 

My boyfriend and I went on a camping trip to a lovely little campsite by the beach. There are some incredible hiking trails there as well so we decided to split an eighth and go on a hiking adventure. My boyfriend has taken shrooms many times

We ate the mushrooms in our tent... it was about 11:15 in the morning and ventured out on our hike. It was a beautiful and clear day. The weather was just right--very warm with a wonderful breeze(we live in California so it's mostly always like this).

About thirty minutes into it

About 45 minutes into the hike is when the trip really began. My body started to feel a little tingly and I burst into the most incredible

It was the most beautiful hike I've been on. I was leading it, ""How did I not know about this before?"" I don't know how to explain it but everything felt so *right.*

Because of the elevation, not too fast and slow enough to look at and appreciate everything around us. We didn't get tired *at all*, I didn't feel cold even though it was a lot colder the higher up we got and I get cold easily, I didn't feel hungry or tired. All I wanted to do was keep going.

 I had a lot of realizations. The biggest one was how wonderful it was to not know anything. My boyfriend and I were talking about this the whole time. I realized that not everything has to have an explanation

Coming down sucked because I didn't want this amazing feeling to go away. I felt young and strong and beautiful  and like I could do anything. I also felt a lot of love for myself. It was nice though

We looked at the clock for the first time since that morning and it was 3:34. I was amazed because it felt like a whole day had gone by. 

We both had an incredibly positive experience thanks to each other that day. We felt each others' warm energies and love and that's what made it so positive. The setting too of course. It was a beautiful place

For anybody who wants to have a positive experience it's really important that you respect the drug. Don't overthink it. It has a lot to show you and a lot to teach you and if you let go and let it do its thing

That's another thing

Make sure someone you trust is with you. You will really feel other peoples' energies when you're tripping and you don't want to be with someone negative who will bring you down or around a bunch of people you don't know. Trust me

The last and probably the most important thing... **GO ON A FUCKING ADVENTURE.** Especially if you're worried about overthinking/having a bad trip. If you have something to do

I'm really grateful for the experience and I definitely learned a lot from it. If you do it under the right circumstances you will have a positive experience and learn a lot. Just remember to respect the drug. I look forward to tripping again and seeing what else lies in store for me.

My friends and I have only ever been under the influence of alcohol

I understand that you can't really prepare us for what we'll feel

* How important is setting? Loud or Peaceful make a difference? (I assume peace and quite is preferred.)

* Should music be present or perhaps not?

* Should we all make sure to have eaten beforehand? Or does this matter?

* What things should we make sure aren't available to anyone who is having an intense trip (good or bad)?

These are just a few off the top of my head.  If anyone can provide any information

I have 4 or 5 friends who I've discussed the subject with that would be willing to do it with me. I have another friend who knows someone who always has shrooms and will happily get them for me at $20 an eighth. He's  tripped on these shrooms before and suggests that I dose an eighth per person



**Trip One**

I'll preface this by saying I'm a minor and live with my parents. I keep my drug use from them as best I can and as far as they know I've only ever drank alcohol


I made plans with two of my friends to sneak out and meet at a park near our school. It's about a 7 mile ride for me, I have a fairly low tolerance. It was then that my friend brought out the salvia. He packed a nice big bowl and let me take the first hit. I held for awhile and exhaled, took a second hit but didn't hold it nearly as long. After about a minute the effects hit me. My thought process was seriously altered. The first thing I noticed was that my arms extended past my shoulders and behind my head, in my mind my arm was far larger than usual but the part that was out of my field of vision and was as large as a pyramid. I knew this was just the salvia, but it was an interesting sensation to wiggle my massive arms around knowing that they didn't really have the dimensions I was registing in my mind. After getting acquainted with my arms I looked down and saw my shoes and the way they were positioned came to somehow represent the location of my neighborhood grocery store and the rest of he neighborhood. It felt very deeply meaningful at the time and I couldn't tear my eyes off my feet for awhile. When I finally did look up my friends were laughing at me for wiggling my arms around and being amazed at them. Behind them I noticed the wood framing inside the shed, [similar to this minus the window.](http://www.shedsforlessdirect.com/storage-sheds-images/Best-Barns-Elm-Shed-inside.jpg) Each panel of the shed seemed to represent a different scene that I couldn't enter. I focused on one of them and was able to see leaves on a tree and imagined it being a peaceful place. I tried to focus on another but saw something similar. At this point the trip began to fade. We stayed in the shed talking longer, I occasionally asked to smoke more salvia because I had enjoyed it but my friend didn't acknowledge my requests. We finally left at 2:00 or 3:00 AM. For me the trip lasted about 10 minutes. This could be attributed to the weed but on the bike ride home I kept seing seeing faces from afar that would later turn out to be holes in bushes

**Trip Two**

My second trip was with one of my friends from the first trip. It was about 1:00PM on a sunny sunday afternoon. We went up to the top level of a parking garage where there weren't any cars and found 3 plastic crates and sat down on them. We smoked a little weed, similar to meme text. I began to wonder how long this would last. I stated to worry it would last forever and I wouldn't be able to handle the responsibilities of day to day life if I did. Then I decided it wouldn't matter if it lasted forever because I would enjoy perpetually tripping through life no matter what. Eventually my thoughts shifted and I came to realize that the black lines separating the triangles were shaped like a person, which I realized was me. I had become the black lines that separated the triangles. On a level I knew I wasn't, but it seemed so profound at the time, that I could envision myself within my field of vision and I was no longer really what I had been before. It was at that point that I realized that it would eventually wear off, I would be able to handle life and I wasn't really a series of black lines. With that realization I decided I wanted to get up and walk around before it did end. This proved difficult because my body felt connected to the crate I was sitting on, and uprooting myself was no easy task. I walked across the parking lot until I came to the edge. I looked down, which was rather uninteresting since it was completely empty. We then took the stairs to the ground and sat at a table watching Off The Air

On Sunday I tripped with some friends. I'm a decently experienced shroomer, until something weird happened much later in the trip. We were definitely on the come-down, we took the shrooms around 5 and this happens probably sometime around 10-11. We had smoked a very generous about of bud, so we were still vibing. 

We were chilling, during the song ""She's so Heavy"", my mind starts to wander off a bit. I don't know why, but I started thinking of that scene in super troopers when the guy has to eat all of the shrooms. For some reason this made me imagine a situation in which a cop made me eat a lot of shrooms. Like a life-changing amount. Then, only what I can describe as a panic attack happens. One second I'm still imagining having to eat all of those shrooms, the next thing I know I'm laying on the ground and my friends are freaking out. I felt like I was tripping hardcore, and according to my friends my eyes had gone into the back of my head and I just fell to the ground. They turned the vinyl off, but i was in a cold sweat and I was very pale. After eating some and drinking water I felt better within 20 minutes or so.
