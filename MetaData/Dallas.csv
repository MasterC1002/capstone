1367200231.0,1db5iv,Did anyone see me get jumped on Pacific Ave outside of Le Vu around 2 am Saturday morning?,byerover,985,171,518,"Last I remember I walked into Le Vu on Pacific Ave in West Deep Ellum (first time ever at this bar) and ordered a round of drinks for my two friends and I.  Next thing I know I wake up in the ER at Baylor looking like this at around 7 am on Saturday April 27.  http://imgur.com/a/4fgsj#0  (I had a class 3 concussion so I don't remember anything after buying the first round of drinks)
A detective came by today and gave me a few details from the police report.  Witness reported that I was outside the bar (waiting for a cab most likely) and two men were in a car parked outside as well.  Some sort of a verbal argument happen between myself and the driver.  The driver jumped out and knocked me out and then the passenger walked around and kicked me in the face repeatedly.  They then got back in their car and drove away.  No one got the plates and I'm not yet sure of the car make and model.  I arrived at Baylors ER by 2:51.


Talked to my friends yesterday morning and they said a little after 1:30 am on the 27th they asked me if I wanted to leave and I said I wanted to wait until it closed (they said I may have been talking to a girl I met).  So they left and weren't there when it happen.

Damage:

*6-7 stitches on my right cheek.

*6-7 stitches above my left eye.

*class 3 concussion

*fractured forehead and sinus cavity

*because of fractured sinus cavity

*left cheek is caved in

*nose is severely broken

*left eye swollen shut (it's starting to go down now though)

*horizontal gash on the bridge of the nose

*Several scrapes and cuts on the right side of my face from the concrete

*several bruises and cuts on my neck and body from concrete impact and kicks that missed my head


I am meeting with a plastic surgeon tomorrow to assess the damage tomorrow, and 3 days (so far) in the hospital.  I need help to find these people who did this, any information would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: fixed formatting. 


Edit: I passed out from my pain meds after posting this. Holy shit guys


Edit 3: Apparently it was Jenna Jamesons birthday party at that bar that night.

She was discharged from University Behavioral Health Center in Denton about 24 hours ago.  She attempted to drive north to Bonham but somehow got lost and ended up at an abandoned Jack in The Box in Dallas.  The meds have left her moderately delusions.  She's improved but when the withdrawals hit

Here is the airport's response which I thought went above and beyond:
 
The aircraft you experienced was an F18 that entered the Metroplex airspace from the southwest.  It was cleared to cross over DFW for a landing at Dallas Love Airport (DAL).  It crossed over your neighborhood at about 4, your F18 provides an excellent comparison.  Military aircraft are not subject to the quieting requirements placed on commercial aircraft.  Though a military jet and a commercial jet may share basically the same engine, the commercial jet is much quieter.

So, I’ll wake up and feel like I can take on the world.    
    
Yesterday, I had the windows down and top down on my jeep, and I just felt upbeat and optimistic.  Hell, I was even convinced I looked good.     

So it's a sunny Saturday and I'm cruising with some good beats, and I'm terrified to take any steps, even baby steps, to push myself along in the right direction.    

Why do I struggle to do that?  Well, so I went home, went on craigslist, and bought myself a filing cabinet to start getting literally organizing my life.  I mean, I pay bills on time and whatnot, but all of my important stuff I should have filed away is in various piles strewn about my apartment.  

Anyway I got a good deal on this two drawer filing cabinet, then headed to office depot to grab the hanging sleeves and folders for it.  I was pumped to start being an adult.    
 
So I bought the office supply stuff and start heading home.  I decide to pick up some a chicken and some salad stuff from Tom Thumb for dinner later.  Go up to pay, but with room for a few cards, some cash inside, then i wrap a rubber band around it. But regardless it's not there. 

Phone:yes. Keys:yes. Nothing else.  I tell the cashier I think I left my wallet in my car and will be back.  I go look everywhere with no luck.  So I shamefully walk back inside and tell the lady I lost my wallet.  They were nice though and didn't make  put back all the food whilst hiding my face and being laughed at by everyone behind my back.  

Got in the car and called the Office Depot hoping for a miracle.    I was there only 20 minutes ago

But I had to call to be sure. There was always a chance. 

 
And so I called.  And they had no idea what I was talking about and said no one was in buying filing folders earlier.  Talk about disheartening and dejecting. Not only was the wallet gone but I they couldn't even recall me from 20 minutes ago

Turns out I'm a moron I called the wrong store.  There were 2 stores displayed on google maps on my phone and I chose wrong. 

So I rang the other store.  And just as soon as I  brought up the situation and mentioned I there minutes earlier looking for filing folders

 **Holy shit.**  

That feeling of relief was glorious.  It was like being physically and emotionally cleansed of all your sins ever in one of those private jacuzzi bathtubs that rich people have but never use. The ones with the jets and water suction pump that can suck your hair in and try to drown you


I'm talking relief like when you've been running errands all day with an upset stomach, just as you pull into the driveway, bitching to your girlfriend about how it's *not* cute to be herded around IKEA by those stupid fucking arrows like a rat when suddenly your stomach turns on you. **FUCK.** Next thing you know doors are flying open and you're barreling from the car, to the house, and into the bathroom as fast as humanly possible, all the while trying to simultaneously focus on unclasping your belt and keeping your asshole clenched, and before your pants can even slide down to your knees-before your cheeks even touch the seat, you fucking made it kind of relief. 

So yeah

And thus, eager to be reunited with my only black friend. The doors parted like magic as I walked in - Oh was it heavenly.  I was greeted with open arms and cheering from some guy looking for printer ink.

 Yeah yeah, this shit happens, you lucked out.* But enough about her, more about me. I was ecstatic. Everything still there.  Like 60 bucks, 2 credit cards, debit card, license

Apparently a customer had seen me drop it or saw it on the ground in the parking lot and without giving it a second thought brought it straight to the store manager.  They probably yelled to me but I play my music too loud because that's how I like it so they're desperate cries of *please come back......please* never made it to my ears.

Honestly though I can't thank whoever found it and turned it in enough.  If you had caught up with me I would have offered to buy you a beer or lunch or something.

As I mentioned at the beginning, but others too.  Though you didn't know I was in the middle of trying to get my life together, if you hadn't come along who knows what the hell could have happened.  Just took a good person in the right place in the right time and my weekend was made.

**tl;dr:** Wallet returner - you're alright in my book.  Yesterday you provided me immense instantaneous relief

I have a special story I just want to share. I don't really have anyone special to share it with... so I think you will appreciate it.

I am a 22[F] and I move to Dallas from Houston 3 years ago after losing my home in a Hurricane Ike. About 2 weeks after I moved here, the same man raped another woman. And then the month after that, another. (I later came to find out he went to Detroit in between time) There were 3 KNOWN victims total, including myself.

After 3 years of waiting and waiting, so he will essentially spend the rest of his life in prison.

At first, because when i took the stand to testify, I was so strong and gave one of county's toughest defense lawyers a run for his money. When they read the verdict, I knew that it meant he'd spend the rest of his life in jail but for some reason I just couldn't find it in myself to celebrate like the other victims and their families. I just kind of stayed quiet and people would hug me and I'd hug back but inside I was just wishing everyone would leave me alone and stop touching and talking to me so I could process this and figure out why I was so unsatisfied. After a while, we were on our way out and this sex crimes detective came up to me while I was standing alone in lobby and hugged me. Then I just kind of broke down. After a few minutes of crying on her shoulder (this was the first tear I had shed the entire time in court), we left and my mom and I started to head down 75 to my house but I was still just upset and again, I couldn't figure out or even explain why.

My mom kept asking me where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do and I just didn't even know. I was speechless and couldn't even think, an unable to grasp the reason why. It was over! So I just stared out of my window, tears rolling down my face.

Then

This young guy (probably mid-late 20's) with a dark beard and dark hair drove by in a new, and then sped off.

And I swear to God

And now, but this guy just completely turned this dark emotion in me around and brightened up my day. 

I couldn't stop laughing and was so thankful that this random guy did something so little but something so big for me that I drew a big ""Thank you :)"" on note book paper and held it up to my window when we drove past him

Then a week later we get a call from another bank telling us they had our auto loan.

First off, so we didn't let that scare us away.  We headed to the (very limited) salad bar, only to find browned lettuce, floppy broccoli, old tomatoes, old cucumbers, some bleh pasta salad, black beans with pieces of unused meat in it

So, and offers it to us, ""Either of you care for medium-well sirloin steak?""

Medium-well?  Well, as they sat on our plates.  Next guy brings around some bacon-wrapped chicken.  NOW WE'RE TALKING!!!  

Nope.  The bacon was only cooked on two opposing sides, overnight.  Over salted and seasoned to hell.  Even the bacon flavor was killed by the amount of seasonings they put on it.

They bring more bullshit by, and seasoned horribly.  The sausage tasted like licorice, and the BBQ they glazed the pork loin in was more like jelly, and definitely not a taste you want in your mouth.  Incredibly disappointing experience.  In fact, the only thing that my wife and I could agree was good, was the little pieces of grilling cheese that they served like it was bread.

So now I'm back at work, at all costs.  I feel violated.  If they offered me a rib eye, for free, I'd turn it down.

**MY SCHEDULE (so far)**

* Flight 1846 - Depart SAN DIEGO CA (SAN) at 1:30 PM / Arrive in AUSTIN TX (AUS) at 6:15 PM
* Flight 2988 - Change planes in AUSTIN TX (AUS) at 7:40 PM / Arrive in DALLAS LOVE FIELD (DAL) at 8:40 PM
* Being picked up at the airport by **utahz**
* I think Im also meeting **Synamin** at the airport too.
* I flew home on Saturday with my mom and my dad.

**UPDATE:** I just got a text from my mom.  They are moving him to a hospice at 2425 Texas drive in Irving

**UPDATE 2:** I should be landing at Dallas Love Field at about 8:30pm on the 15th.  According to Google Maps I shouldnt be more than 12 miles away from where hes at so I can probably just walk since I will only be bringing a backpack.

**UPDATE 3:** I fly in on flight 2988 which is a connecting flight from flight 1846.  My info is BrandenK(at)gmail.com and my google phone number is 858-877-3577.  I didnt want to give this away initially but I could really care less at this point.

**UPDATE 4:** I am absolutely blown away by the responses I am getting and if you contacted me I apologize but I will get back to you soon.  I have been overwhelmed with responses and I have a lot to deal with but I assure you no gesture is going unnoticed.  I have shared this thread with my dad and mom and according to my mom, with all these responses he has no choice but to realize he is leaving us in good hands.

**UPDATE 5:** Rough night but I did get some sleep.  Im just getting dog sitters lined up and getting the house clean to keep my mind off things.  One project left to do but I wont get it done in time so maybe one of you guys can help me?  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kejmp/i_know_its_random_but_can_any_of_you_make_an/

**UPDATE 6:** Im in Austin waiting on my layover.  I was told to try some Amy's Ice Cream so thats where I am headed next.  I may not get a chance to update once I get to Dallas but I will check in with you guys by tomorrow.  THANK YOU again to everyone from the bottom of my heart.

They were hung for quite some time 4 for guilty and 2 for not guilty. They found me guilty and set the fine at...$1. I think that speaks volumes. My attorney asked for time served in lieu of the court costs of $74 and the judge refused that as well. My attorney and I will be appealing this to the county court now based on principle alone. We will subpoena the city manager as well as others on the city council.    
         
I refuse to lay down and just take what the city is doling out. I do not think they had any right to evict us from the park and I will fight it to the end.

Hi /r/dallas folks.

**TL

Here's the email:

&gt;Hi folks

&gt;After speaking with [local ham/weather guy] about today’s weather

&gt;There’s not enough information yet to forecast the situation for our particular area in North Texas, should highlight the importance of keeping vigilant and keeping eyes to the skies tonight.

&gt;Main weather watches and warnings are here: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/

&gt;A graphic warning page is here (my preferred page): http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/gwarn/data.php?file=nwswarning

&gt;We will be having our Personal Disaster Preparedness (PDP) training tomorrow afternoon for the office

&gt;I’ll forward more iNWS products throughout the night as well

Stay safe!

This guy was completely unprofessional and after a few hours told us that some filters needed to be replaced along with a few leak repairs or something and that it wasn't covered by the warranty. The cost was $300 and my mother paid it.

Two weeks after that (a few days ago) the check engine light came on again along with some weird engine noises. This time my mother took it to a trusted mechanic that found a slew of major problems with for grand total of over $1

My roommate has a five year old daughter that attends a private elementary school in north dallas. She's a pretty shy kid. I've only interacted with her a handful of times

Here's where it gets weird. She was suspended from school for being too quiet. My roommate told me the school cited some sort of safety issue that was outlined in some handbook. I've asked him to bring me a copy and find out exactly what they are referring to. 
From what he told me about his meeting with the principal

He told me she has friends that she talks about when she comes home from school. So it isn't like she doesn't speak to anyone

I am of the opinion that her teachers get frustrated with her shyness and quiet nature

Now what I'm interested in is

TL;DR
Roommate's daughter got suspended from school for being too quiet/shy. School cites some handbook

Edit: Took off where she goes to school. Trying to protect his identity because he didn't ask me to do this.

My girlfriend and I found them on the 28th in the park by the rec center in Cedar Hill.  Posters are up, we could not leave them... they followed us close by every inch of the way back home :)

We took them to Petmobile for inoculations and a checkup and got them lots of treats and chews.  We are ~~hoping~~ insisting someone will adopt them together as a pair; they have spent their lives together so far and rely on each other for guidance and support.  Hopefully whomever adopts them  can help us with what we've spent on them so far

** update: Three boys claiming to be the owners of the dogs we found came by, and no comprehension of what illnesses dogs can get. We told them that was unacceptable and they got testy. Cops were called. We still have the dogs, and have a few different plans on how to ensure they are cared for responsibly in the future",,False,self,t5_2qnkr,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1hqvau/i_have_also_found_a_dog_and_her_brother/

My husband tried to give him the burger anyway, so no Karma whoring for me. I just would like for this to get some exposure so we can make some changes. It's understandable for it to be illegal to set up an unlicensed food kitchen, but being threatened over one thing for one person is deplorable.

I am heart broken I can't keep him but he needs a home where he can be watched over more closely. I work about 12 hours a day and can't take care of him like I should. He cried when I left today. :( 


ETA: Not my dog. Just wanted to save him and take care of his medical bills. I will foster him until I find a forever home. Will NOT leave him at a shelter. Not an option. I will love him until a better pet parent can care for him.

Please, please PM me.


UPDATE: He is feeling better. Limping now


Thank you to all who care so much about animals. After witnessing people honk at us for stopping to help him



UPDATE 3/28/13: He is doing much better!! He is limping around and is getting around nicely with less pain. I guess he has really bonded to us and doesn't want to be away from us. He is our little satellite.

**[Continuation of this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/kfv7u/flying_to_dallas_to_be_with_my_dying_father_never/)**

**UPDATE 1:** At this point we are saying our final goodbyes and getting things ready for the trip back to San Diego.  I think we have things pretty well taken care of but I think the whole family could use a change of pace.  There are about 8 of us and we are going to go out to dinner tonight

**UPDATE 2:** Someone suggested Hard 8?  Anyone have any feedback on that place?

**FINAL UPDATE:** My father just passed at 5:02pm.  We had the last family member arrive just 30 minutes before his last breath.  Because of whats going on I am not sure we will make it to dinner tonight.  Dallas thank you again for all the help!  For being stuck in a city other than my own

We are headed to Hard 8 for a quick dinner.  If anyone buys a drink tonight please buy or have a black label johnnie walker in his honor.  I would like to thank MaverickTTT for the extra cash so I can do the same for him tonight.

Suffice it to say that Dallas does not have streets overflowing with delicious barbacoa meat. I've been in Dallas for a few years now and am just now finding great places to find great tacos

If you've found any good taco stands/trucks/restaurants

1. Chito's - Plano - http://www.yelp.com/biz/chitos-plano
2. El Grande Burrito - Allen - http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-grande-burrito-allen
3. Unnamed (in Jamal's Convinience Store) - Plano - http://www.yelp.com/biz/jamals-convenience-store-plano

What makes a good taco stand? There's usually a few good rules:

1. Accepts only cash
2. Lots of brown skin
3. Does not call itself 'tex-mex'

Chito's and Grande Burrito take credit

I know about the Fuel City tacos but haven't been yet. On my next drive to Houston I'll be sure to make a detour.

For the second year in a row I am participating in a Stair Climb in Dallas at Fountain Place Building known as the [Big D Climb](http://llswa.convio.net/site/TR/Events/DallasBigClimb?team_id=47964&amp;pg=team&amp;fr_id=1270) or AKA...

**""*Why* would you do that to yourself??""**

Well... because a business I worked with asked me to be the point of contact for their partnership with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. I happily obliged

I did so happily because my Step-Father, and earnest man and I want to honor him. 

I am overjoyed to report that he is in fine health now. However

Mike told my Mama that the worst part of his treatment was not the bone-marrow biopsies or incredible sickness after chemotherapy or the fear that he would soon die but that it was seeing the kids with leukemia in the waiting rooms. 

He said a parents face in that state was a terrible thing to behold.

I am on a mission to remove that look &amp; *I need your help.*

Last year I participated in the climb and built a small team to climb with me. I am ashamed to admit I did not raise any money further than my entrance fee. But this year will be different. This year my Mama and I are climbing together. This year I will make a difference in the fight against Blood Disease.

I will come down from my podium now and humbly ask:

Will you donate to my Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society fundraising team?

Any amount is acceptable &amp; all donors will be thanked personally.

Thank you for updating your stock email response in regards to Dublin Dr Pepper! We'd like to welcome you to our 2 week occupation of your Facebook wall! As this is your first official acknowledgment of our very legitimate complaint with what your company has done to Dublin Dr Pepper, to know that the lack of our dollars over the past 14 days has put you on the defensive. We sincerely look forward to what the lack of those dollars will cause you to do over the coming days, weeks, and months.

Now, and your 121 year predecessor in a rather negative light. You want us to believe, on faith, mostly, that Dublin Dr Pepper was in violation of an agreement in their practice of distributing outside of a certain six county area. But you know, we don't have access to a copy of that agreement, do we? We don't know that Dublin was bound to that area. All we know is that that area was Dublin's, a group of consumers you've already lost, go ahead and provide us that agreement. We'd love to see that language binding Dublin Dr Pepper to those six counties. We'll be here anyway

Now, including another Texas tradition based out of Waco, Big Red. And we've also been informed that you would co-opt Dublin Dr Pepper's consumer base by continuing production of cane sugar Dr Pepper from the Temple bottling plant. It will be called Heritage, and will keep the same sweetener. But the cane sugar wasn't what we were buying. And it wasn't what was keeping that small town of 3,800 thriving, or those 14 people in jobs. It was 121 years of history, tradition, something you heard by word of mouth from a friend of a friend. At a party. From your college roommate, an experience, as we're sure you are recognizing.

And the thing is, and Dublin still hasn't had its history restored. You've changed your stock email, and Dublin still hasn't had its tradition restored. You have vowed to continue supporting Dr Pepper Days, and Dublin still cannot be shared with friends, family, or the otherwise uninitiated. And yet, here we are. We still aren't buying your products, family

Here we are
