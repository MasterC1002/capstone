They also like to say that there's no evidence that CO2 is produced by humans on a sufficient scale- one guy told me that the oceans are the main CO2 source (they absorb more CO2 than they release

I don't want to say it

Don't get me wrong, just as harmful to serious climate science than denialists.

Is there some kind of siege of the ill-informed? Could it really be a conspiracy or a concerted trolling effort? How do you fight that?

I just recently sent this PM to someone who asked me about the CO2 lag. Hopefully it will provide some useful information for your own anti-ignorance efforts.

I've already spoken with someone with several similar misconceptions. It is true that, that as the earth's orbital cycles- the Milankovitch cycles- increased the amount of incoming solar energy, this increased temperatures, which caused a feedback effect over the course of centuries where temperatures increased, ice retreated, and more CO2 was released, which itself caused more temperature increases.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas which increases temperatures

Anyway

Now

    The global temperature change is ten times faster than any natural cycle ever seen. At the end of previous glacial cycles

    Modern warming can't be caused by a change in solar output because the current trend in the Milankovitch cycles has been down, however, there is correlation between modern CO2 release and global average temperatures.

    Atmospheric CO2 has substantially exceeded the levels we've seen in the past. Here's one set of data. As you can see

I want you to take a good long look at that last one. Over the past half a million years (anatomically modern man is only 200, as you may have heard, we've passed 400 ppm- in geologic terms, in the blink of an eye. Here's more proof that it's human-caused CO2 emmissions.

Just some facts:

1) The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fourier, far colder due to escaping heat.

2) John Tyndall, including carbon dioxide. He confirmed, and quantified, that carbon dioxide absorbs and reemits infrared radiation, retaining heat.

3) Svante Arrhenius, the change in global temperatures corresponding to a change in carbon dioxide, and these estimates have been revised ever since.

4) There was never a name change from ""global warming"" to ""climate change."" The first journal article to ever use the term ""global warming"" was titled ""Climate change: Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?"" (Broecker 1975). Both terms are accurate and refer to different phenomena.

5) On the same note, this proved not to be the case, and the majority warming viewpoint held.

6) We are not currently seeing ""natural variation."" Yes, it is only by comparing the current, artificial variation to natural processes that climatologists discern an anomaly to begin with.

7) On a similar note, cyclical patterns. If you look at the Milankovitch cycles, you can see that glaciations occur with roughly 100,000 year and 400,000 year periodicity. These timeframes coincide with changes to the eccentricity of Earth's orbit, which plays a big role in how much sunlight reaches the Earth.

8) Each ice age is followed by a post-glacial maximum temperature. The most recent one occurred 8, there is a slow overall decline in temperatures with minor natural variations that proceeds until the
start of the next ice age. Never in the record has there been a case when, until now.

9) Furthermore, coinciding with temperature trends.

10) It is not ""the sun."" First of all, it makes no logical sense to argue that right around the mid-1960s, the effect of solar variation randomly became much, much greater than it had before. Thirdly, a solar influence would cause universal warming across all layers of atmosphere. However,we are seeing a decrease in stratospheric temperatures along with the increase in tropospheric temperatures. This precludes a solar and demands a terrestrial explanation; only a difference in physical effects of the lower atmosphere explains the divergence in temperature trends. The only physical difference in the lower atmosphere before and after the start of the modern warming trend that accounts for warming is an increased concentration of CO2.

11) Researchers are not doing this ""for the money."" I'm a researcher (not climatology) who has worked on grants from the government as well as contract work for ExxonMobil. Who do you imagine pays better? If there were credible evidence against the scientific consensus on global warming

12) There was no evidence of wrongdoing or falsification of data in the so-called ""Climategate"" fiasco. A couple sentences were taken completely out of context, which they knew to be inaccurate, with the actual temperature readings averaged at thousands of meteorological stations worldwide. They replaced faulty data with the single most accurate and complete data set available. You can look up the other instances where their research was mischaracterized.

13) Deniers who claim there has been no recent warming are cherry-picking data. Many start their trend with the year 1998, and see what results they get. Furthermore, the 2000s were the hottest decade on record, and each of the last 12 years has been one of the hottest 13 on record (1998 being the exception).

14) According to NASA satellite gravimetry data

There is, the consensus is clear. Do your due diligence, and actually look into the research, rather than accepting the denier fascination with Al Gore as some kind of evidence against 188 years of climate science. The greenhouse effect was discovered 124 years before he was born, and four years before the Democratic Party was *even founded*. The idea that this is something people have recently made up for some kind of conspiracy is simply untrue, and ignorant of the true history of the discipline. Oh, and one more pet peeve.

15) It is NOT volcanoes. The USGS estimates that humans release 135 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes annually. If someone tells you that one volcanic eruption is equal to yadda yadda yadda,False,,t5_2qhx3,1342712970.0,,,t3_rmmto

There was another [right-wing link](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/zlsqu/denying_the_catastrophe_the_science_of_the/) posted by the shill/group that operates the [AlyssaMoore](/user/AlyssaMoore) account - the only funny part in all that is the solid debunking from JRugman (which was nevertheless downvoted by at lest 13 morons).

A somehow interesting thread was [this one about comments regarding the death of one of the biggest assholes in the world](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/zvr9d/warmist_skeptical_science_author_john_hartz_on/) - the most interesting thing resulting there was that [""buddy Poptart""](/user/Poptech) is frequently using the identity of some Andrew Khan (among probably many others - I now also suspect that [publius_lxxii](/user/publius_lxxii) is somehow a full-time employee in some climate denial operation).

Other than the visit from Poptart there have been two other trolls re-emerging - [sdevijver](/user/sdevijver) and [Sunsettommy](/user/Sunsettommy) - I suspect that those could be the same moron

There have been other ""fresh"" accounts - [GovernmentGrantMoney](/user/GovernmentGrantMoney) could be the moderator [kokey](/user/kokey) - former [gst](/user/gst) and now slowly abandoning [ManBearPigg](/user/ManBearPigg) after I exposed him.

Almost everything else - like over 20-30 posts - was about the Lewandowsky social study - the funniest part was that one poster tried to start a [somehow related poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/zu1vx/too_much_fake_debate_on_lewandowsky_lets_settle/) - but of course that all the deniers that invent crap on how it is all a left-wing conspiracy now consider themselves ""center or center-left"" - going as far as to say ""voting 3rd party"" just to cover for their libertard vote - the dishonesty of [Will_Power](/user/Will_Power) is now as legendary as his complete ignorance :)",,t5_2qhx3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/zxnz3/catching_up_with_the_local_deniers_stuff_from/

The first Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on what would eventually became known as AIDS appeared on June 5, with few exceptions, ignored it. It wasn't until the problems cascaded and the number of cases grew that AIDS became a true national issue. 

This past June marked the 25th anniversary of Hansen's testimony

It will take another 25 years before the world is truly ready to deal with climate change. By then, and temperature records, will be inescapable. Similar to the number of AIDS cases at the five year point, the evidence will be beyond rational dispute.
