Update: Today went very well. It was long and exhausting, in fact, that women were getting to know each other and helping support each other based on their mutual hatred for the protesters. It was a pretty beautiful sight to behold, and to be a part of. In fact, I found another atheist to chat with, and we passed all the down time by talking about atheism, which made the day fly by. I opted for a medication abortion, but the physical pain in my own home will hopefully be manageable. I want to thank all you godless babes for your support and loving words. It really made what could have been the worst day of my life

My brother is the pastor of the church I once attended, so it was a semi-hostile discussion), and he said that it has never been done before; either people move their memberships, or they are brought up in a deacon's meeting for ""denying the faith"" and are excluded. 

My brother and I reached sort of a compromise-- women are not allowed to speak in business meetings; they must get a man to represent them. I proposed that I attend the deacon's meeting where they talk about my exclusion

The deacon called me today to say that is not possible, because I'm a member and I'm speaking about my own membership. Right?""

""Well... our procedure doesn't allow for that.""

""Because I'm a woman.""

""Yes

""I made a conscious decision to join the church

""well, that for whatever reason you've suddenly decided god doesn't exist anymore.""

""I am a member of your church, and your procedures. This is not a sudden decision; I've been trying to get my membership off your books for almost five years now. I would like to articulate my own reason.""

""Well

After several minutes of this, since obviously what you're describing to me is that you don't believe in god and that is grounds for exclusion. But you're always welcome to come back.""

I gave him a cheerful ""I won't

I called my brother to re-discuss the compromise we'd talked about before, no, you can't talk in business meeting, all you want to do is make some statement and cause a scene, and we can't allow that. Just quietly be excluded.

It angers me that they won't let me have a say in my own membership because of my gender.
It angers me that they're perpetuating their bigotry
It angers me that reason has no effect whatsoever on them. And it never will, fuck religion. I can't believe this.

At the rehearsal dinner

The toast that took the cake was from the bride's cousin. The cousin is 26, I love you so much. I can't wait to see you grow in your marriage. I just wanted to say that, when the world tells you not to submit, you should ignore it. Because submission is where true freedom lies. Sometimes you're just going to want to run your little mouth, but just remember the wife you're called to be.""

For one thing, presumably, they are taken at their word. To diminish the actions of women, while not doing the same for the actions of men, is to reinforce the 'men act, women are acted upon' meme as it currently exists in society. Since the community also doesn't question the actions of women who choose to be atheist, there's also the implication that, women only do so if they choose what makes them feel more comfortable. 

I also find that it diminishes the complicated relationship that many religious people, and many of them probably spent years contemplating whether or not they believed in God. I know I did. However I have found that this is also true of many religious people that I know; the only difference is that they went the other way. People are complicated and reducing the complicated thoughts and actions of another group of human beings to something simple like ""they're abused and don't know any better"" is dehumanizing.

&gt; As a nursing student years ago, days-old baby boy is brought in, stripped naked, his arms and legs strapped down to a plastic board under the glare of brilliant surgery lights. A nurse (sometimes the nursing student) dips a pacifier into sugar water and plugs the crying infant's mouth with it; the doctor swabs the genital area with Betadine or chlorhexidine, places a sterile drape, and injects lidocaine or marcaine around the penis. The infant turns purple from screaming, in spite of the pacifier. The physician pinches the foreskin with forceps to test for numbness; needless to say this isn't too pleasant if the penis isn't yet numb. He then uses a sharp spatula to separate the synechiae that adhere the foreskin to the glans, attaches one of two different devices (Plastibell or Gomco being the most common) and cuts away. It's bloody and in no way painless for the infant. The visibly upset baby is then diapered

&gt;The ethical problems with this were apparent to me even as a green student. It's a medically unnecessary invasive procedure done to a patient incapable of giving consent. Whatever slight future reductions in STDs or urinary infections it may or may not bring hardly seem to outweigh the very real risk of complications of the procedure itself. We don't perform appendectomies or tonsillectomies on neonates to prevent future appendicitis or tonsillitis - why cut off a perfectly normal,False,self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,t3_1diuda

I tell him he needs to know about it before he can have an opinion for or against, for example, ""We don't have to take off our hats at the dinner table because we're not Christian.""

During my years of high school, so it's not like it was a shock to them.) I honestly hadn't realized I'd said something even related until the advisor responded with a phrase I still recall clearly several months later:

""Why can't you just be agnostic?""

At the time, I don't remember anything else about that night except that phrase and how I didn't respond. She probably doesn't even remember saying it, but it still bothers me that she said such a thing. To think that she wrote off my thoughts, beliefs, and feelings with just a single statement tears me apart inside. To know that she hasn't taken my stance on religion seriously all the five years I've known her makes me feel like everything I've said to her has gone in one ear and out the other. I understand that she's 40 years older than me and she's set in her ways, but it still irks me like few other things have before.

I may be just under 20, and hard-working young woman. I deserve to have what I say and feel be respected just as much as anyone else, regardless of what their beliefs are. So why do I feel like all of that is violated by those around me? Why do I feel like people are trying to put me down simply because I don't believe in some vague higher power that's supposed to do things to make the world better, but hasn't done anything personally for me?

Why must we live in a world where it is supposed to be okay to be different

I suppose I may never find the answers to those questions, I'm okay with that.

In this play, these women serve the men first because they are honored as mothers who feed the children and men first.  And they sit on the ground, not because they are inferior, but because the Earth is revered and so only they have the right to sit so close to it and men cannot.""

And of course, it might be one thing, but we know this is a giant strawman and non-sequitur.  All the religions that demand women eat second, men eat first, and women don't sit with the men, believe so because they feel women are inferior to men.  I walked away feeling more offended and more determined that religions were fucking bullshit.

We are a community focused on discussing and promoting topics pertaining to atheism in not only the black but all minority communities.


After reading  the side panel of /r/GodlessWomen

It seems that at times [/r/Atheism](/r/Atheism) can choose to overlook the concepts that minority and marginalized groups face and often seek to brush such concerns under the rug under the unaware cover of majority ""privilege."" 

Members of [/r/BlackAtheism](/r/BlackAtheism) often face the critique of outsiders who issue charges of self-segregation and race/ethnic-baiting as a means of saying that we should ""all be one""

I have personally witnessed members of not only [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) but other groups partake in jokes

I hope you all will take the time to participate in our discussions and I hope our members will choose to do the same. Don't forget to let them know where you're from as well.

My mother says she didn't worry about us because she was sure god would take care of us since they were busy with ""gods work"".

I was 5 years old when I started boarding school.  I was tortured with electric shocks and routinely raped.  I was verbally and physically abused.   

By the time I was 10, all out of order.  They make no chronological sense.  

I literally would feel like I would float away from my body.  At first there was a reason to ""float away""

When I was older

Later in life I began to piece it together and understand it better but I had a bit of an internal communication problem.  Some parts of me understood

And that is the crux of it.  Unresolved issues.  I feel nothing for my parents.  I feel almost nothing for my siblings.  My parents are getting old.  They will probably pass in the next few years.  I keep thinking I need to ""fix' something before they go.  But I feel nothing for them.  I pretend when I am around them.  I imagine I will feel bad when they die but I can't seem to really feel much of anything.

There was a time I was angry with them.  That hurt them.  I think I am still angry

They still cling to religion and their god and that bothers me.  They still claim god is great

edit:  I re-read the comments today.  Thanks so much.  The child-like part of me wishes she had known some of you long ago, this (sometimes crabby) old lady part of me feels better now.  (smiling) Amazing, the power of a kind word, even a written word.

At the just barely ripe age of fifteen

That’s right, Sarah, we will love you.” To my parents, that may have been something that made total sense to them, how could I not love Jesus for the rest of my life? 

How could I extricate myself from something that defines our family so strongly that it almost defines them? Surely, right? These are things I asked myself when my parents dropped me off at the Upper Room to mingle, mix and listen to the word of God. Or when they shipped me off to church camp for two weeks one summer to listen to the same five songs three times a day and memorize Bible verses that I am positive I do not have the capability to ever forget.

A Douglas Adams quote comes to mind every time I think about these formative years of my lack of belief: “He hoped and prayed that there wasn’t an afterlife. Then, these words have never rung more true… 

The idea of some bearded man up in the sky wielding the world’s every decision, that just gets me. The ridiculous, dated, and hateful words that I have read while examining the bible disgust me. My parents are against gay marriage, but still wear polyester, just saying…

I’m not Christian bashing, but it’s the breaths that fill the space between that define you, that make your life worth it. I do not live by another’s rule book. I do not pray for help in tough situations, I ask for help from those I know are capable and I act. 

Let us be real here, movements and words do. It’s the things that are in real time, the things that are visible to others. The man who raped me was given two Christian names, went to church twice a week and sang in the choir. The man who physically and mentally abused me, then stole my car, claimed that he was a follower of God. My parents who sat idly by while this was going on are Christians. A woman who told me I should kill myself because I complained about a migraine one day at work has never missed a day of church in her life. Do I consider these people to be people of faith? No. I do not define them by their faith; I define them by their actions.

I don’t believe that I have to marry to prove my love to my partner. I don’t believe that I have to procreate in honor of my god’s wishes. I do not write this to boast about my lack of faith. I write about this to speak for other women out there who feel the same way, I still love that my parents have been married for twenty five years, monogamous and happy. But, we do not all live within the confines of these outlines that were laid before us, this pre-planned life span that the patriarchy expects us to perpetuate.

Living without a religion has lent to me the power to embrace my womanhood. I am more comfortable with my body, whether I want to use contraceptives of any sort, whether I want to eat meat on Friday, how I don’t want to marry the man that raped me, whether I want to hold my boyfriend’s hands when I’m on my period, whether I want to have pre-marital sex or not (all of which, of course

I feel free. Independent. Alive. Yet

So many people in passing have said to me that I have no hope, while Pat Robertson simply judges people and asks for their money. 

I volunteer and I give to charity. I smile at strangers. I give directions, transsexual and straight friends equally, without judgment. I don’t accuse others of going to a place where you are damned for eternity and suffer endlessly simply because we disagree about something that simply seems too personal to even talk about with others. 

My atheism has not affected those that I have made friends with, race, sexuality and religion (or lack thereof). This nation is too great to waste time hating each other, let’s just melt together in this pot and create something better. ",,False,self,False,t3_sqyh1

How does an atheist find comfort after the death of a loved one?",Put-A-Bird-On-It,49,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/1j01w3/my_brother_just_passed_away_and_i_dont_know_how/, hung out with a bad crowd, got a job and worked his way up to supervisor


Dealing with the loss of my brother has been very difficult for all of the usual reasons. I have guilt for not trying harder to talk him out of buying a motorcycle. I am depressed of course. Going through the usual things one goes through when they experience grief over the loss of a loved one. But one thing that I am going through differs from everybody else in my family. They are all comforted by the fact that my brother is in heaven, and that they will all see him again someday. They all feel that they can talk to him and he will hear them. I have been looking into bereavement counseling in my area, but they are heavily revolved around religion. 


My question for you is; how do we, I can see how it comforts others in times like this. I can see how it would make death easier to deal with; believing we get to see our loved ones again in heaven. But the fact is, I am an atheist and that is not going to change. I really have nobody to talk to about this. The last time I lost somebody who I was really close with, I was 7 years old and my grandpa passed away. I have no idea how to navigate through this. I am looking for responses with your advice, experiences, wisdom, comforting words, I am looking forward to reading it. If this is the wrong place to post this

I've been following Jessica Ahlquist's case for a few months now, but the fact that this state representative has publicly attacked her is outrageous.

Palumbo has called Miss Ahlquist an ""evil little thing"" as well as asserting that she is brain-washed and ""being coerced by evil people"" (secularists.) This is totally unacceptable.

I had an interesting experience this evening with my mother and I thought that if there is any group of people, it would be here. This is going to be a long one, and if no one reads I don’t even care I just need to get this out there and off my chest. 

**TL;DR: in a dramatic and tense conversation with my mother I took another step solidifying myself identity

I was raised in a very religious Christian family

My mother and I have always had a tumultuous relationship (she has a lot of psychological problems that make it hard to build a trusting relationship). Every time we spend too much time together we end up getting on to some topic or another that sends her off on a rant of some sort

I’m spending the weekend out in the country at their house doing homework and laundry because my building had a fire in the laundry room, it was intended to be more of a joke really. She paused for a moment, and got that “fuck you” look on her face that used to send chills down my spine when I was a kid. 

“So you don’t believe in god?” 

Well damn, taking that painstaking journey through challenging my upbringing and questioning my faith, all the emotion I’ve poured thus far into developing a solid self-affirmation of who I am. Taking anthropology electives this last year has made me really confident in my resolution. Ten years ago I would have balked at the question, caved and ultimately said something like “yes, well mostly, well I’m not sure, but for the most part, you didn’t want them in your life anyway.” But this is my mother. She will effectively cut me off from my entire family if she feels so inclined

“No. No I don’t.” 

Her body tensed and her face tightened. Her lip began to quiver like it does when she’s trying with all her might to refrain from showing complete disgust. The same face she would give when we talked back, that deeper layer was steeped in hate and loathing. It was the face that I saw at church book burnings when she piled on Harry Potter and Origin of The Species only this time there was no satisfaction. 

“Really.” 

That was all she managed to say. It was less of a question and more of a statement or an accusation. I did my best to keep my cool. We debated, I accept responsibility for my actions in this life and acknowledge that I am the only one who can be held responsible for my actions, and that I hope when I leave this earth regardless of where I go there will be no bad memories of me. We talked back and forth for a while; I did not try to defend myself but only to explain. I did not try to dispute any of her points regardless of how much I disagreed; I only said that I understand completely why people feel that way but that it was not something that fit into my life. She started getting really passionate about how evolution is only a theory. Her voice rose and she put aside her knitting to get her hands into the conversation

“You can’t tell me, shake it up, and get a wrench. I didn’t come from monkeys, my mother was not a monkey, and if we all came from monkeys why are there still monkeys? They’ve proven all of Darwin’s *ideas* to be just that. It’s a theory! You can’t prove a theory!”

Man was it hard to keep my mouth shut. Eventually I did speak up

“So is gravity.”

“No it’s not it can be proven.”

“No, we just have an abstract idea of the effects of what we call gravity.”

“Well the molecular and atomic level don’t mean shit. I only care about the stuff that affects human sized things

I wanted to rage. I wanted to scream and go off on all the rants I’ve seen around reddit, and in journals, and papers, and peer reviewed documentation. But then in a beautiful and serene moment I remembered something that she herself used to say when I was a kid. “A man convinced against his will is of the same conviction still.” And I kept my mouth shut. Later she even said

“I believe in mutation

I didn’t even argue. I just let her have her way. For a while I almost felt jealous

Then I felt sad. I almost mourned for my mother that she would never experience the exciting and exhilarating experience of learning something new about the world around you. That new and uncomfortable feeling when you begin to challenge what you believe to attain personal inner peace and understanding would never be fun for her, forsaken, or doomed. That would never be a level of enlightenment my mother would get to experience because she was blinded by years and years of indoctrination and hate.  For the first time today though I did get to feel something new; the feeling that I am completely alone in my life right now and I am okay with that. I can do this without god, without church, and without the bible. I can do this with the lessons I’ve learned, and the knowledge I have. 

I’m not asking for you to contribute

The Quiverfull movement is based on having large families, and to spread the religion.

Some relevant links:

[Quiverfull on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiverfull)

[No Longer Quivering - blog run by former Quiverfull adherents](http://nolongerquivering.com/)

[Razing Ruth - blog of a woman who ran away from a Quiverfull family as a teenager](http://razingruth.blogspot.com/)

I discovered this movement through reading about it on the forums at mothering.com (which has an interesting mix of left wing and right wing, and want to convince their reluctant husbands to convert to the movement. It is not always forced on helpless women by their husbands or fathers, it has some aspects that are appealing to some modern women. 

I think it is interesting because this movement is essentially subsidised by modern technological society

I found it interesting that some women in the movement will often describe ""competetive piety"",  and then eventually move to another stricter  church, and then finally end up with the father of the family leading his family in prayer at home, because the churches were too corrupt and godless.

I was browsing facebook this morning. I've liked many atheist pages and I was catching up on their shared (and reshared) images and articles. I began to shrug off the bits of sexism I was encountering when it occurred to me: I shouldn't have to. I know these things (list of examples to follow) aren't aggressive or really 'that bad'

Examples off the top of my head:
Page I Fucking Love Science shares an image of men 'doing science' including peeping on alien babes (presumably Martians) and mass cloning more babes. Many women object in the comments object. One, but asks when the owner will post something that aknoweledges and uplifts females in science rather than objectifying them. Every male to respond to any of these women telss them 'it's just a joke', 'don't be so sensitive' or similar. One man unironically posts that the women upset about this image must not be able to watch tv/movies or listen to radio or read books because this type of thing is everywhere.

Page Pass The 28th Amendment - Complete Removal Of The Church From The State posts an article about the Governor of AZ advocating public bible classes. The page author calls her a 'fat sow'. The following comment is a direct quote from a commenter
1. He refers to her as a cunt
2. She is ugly and therefore bad.
3. She is a whore. She has sex (which is amoral

[EDIT: More examples.

Page Sexy Atheists uploads a cartoon of a woman playing computer games facing away from the viewer in just her underwear. A man voices his opinion ('disgusting'. Fair enough, he comments again, telling them to play better games if they want to attract a guy. (Full disclosure on this one, I replied:
""This may come as a surprise

I feel like it's odd because I think most men in the atheist / skeptic / secular community are for womens' rights and believe that women are equal. My working theory is that it's a matter of internalizing society's view on women

I don't mean ""praying"" to those things, it's more, for me anyways, appreciating those things. If that makes sense...? 

Does anyone else have similar feelings or am I completely bat shit?",self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/1erfap/question_for_you_ladies/

Part of what I think is important aside from promoting secular humanist women and showing the dangers of religion is to improve debating skills.  Some of the subscribers are college aged and may get to debate religion in classes or for organizations they are members.  The arts of debate and critical thinking are not really taught in school.  Teachers now want to teach to the test.  Even if you find the opinion of the author to be the worst thing in the world, downvote.  The person posting it may want to know what your counterargument is. That person may not agree with it either.

1. Birth control. Free access for over 16s (age of consent in the UK). Go to your general practitioner (GP) or, no questions asked (except to check if you need regular or strong ones). 

2. Emergency contraception. Go to GP and get a free prescription. Alternatively, it was £23 (maybe $28) about seven years ago. I am pretty sure that under-16s do not require parental consent for this. In fact, it may be accessed through some schools (which have been the target of some religious/family groups). 

3. Termination. Free to access or elect to pay privately. Visit your GP (counts as the first doctor to sign it off), they are required by law to have another doctor in the practice see you and sign it off. Appointments take maybe a week or so to come through. Never seen or heard of any picketing outside clinics, although it likely happens. Pro-lifers were banned from demonstrating at my university as their material was deemed to be specifically aimed at causing distress and likely not representative. Under-16s can access termination without parental consent, as long as they can demonstrate they understand what's happening. However, it's fair to say that most will be strongly advised to bring in their parents or guardians.

4. General sex education. At (secular) primary school (7-11 years)

I follow my heart

I grew up Christian, to not be able to use and indulge in your imagination, but I couldn't rationalize it in my head.

After a while my mother went through I phase which I think was some kind of mental breakdown. She didn't force me to go to church, and just generally let myself imagine anything I wanted. Unfortunately I still felt offended when I went to watch certain shows because I still held onto certain beliefs and prejudices. (Such as when I wanted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer but wouldn't after Buffy made fun of JWs...I wouldn't watch the show for years, until this year. Now I feel like I missed out on something wonderful.)

I got older and I started to think more about the Bible. I repressed my sexuality. I tried occasionally to repress my imagination. I tried to live still within the rules of the Bible. And it was killing me. I felt it. But going to college, even when I let my imagination run wild as a teen.

Now, though, I feel that religion is indeed a poison to the minds of humanity, a shackle that also covers up what it truly means to be human. Yet, since I am human I will stay make mistakes. So I will continue to learn to be a better person, and hope that one day I will be more tolerable to theism. 

**TL;DR** My heart and my imagination lead me into Atheism and also into the love of science. So it isn't just your brain that will lead you to renounce your beliefs,False,self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,t3_nu9gq

I said there's got to be somebody, that makes about as much sense as women within literature/arts/math/etc being missed or ignored. It's not that they aren't there, we just don't know about them.


And this is where the fight started. I said something about how hard it is for women to stick to it through a science program, even stated point-blank that this is what they were doing. Nevermind the countless reports, studies, complaints, even an article on this very subreddit that i just read wherein a (actively female friendly) male DJ both addresses the point of dwindling female participation in an atheist conference and also misses it completely (it can't be an actual harrassment problem, it must just be a perception problem). No, it can't be that women get FED UP with this crap over time and just check out of the men's club. Can't be. It's all in her head.

 I am, feminist (and atheist but that's obvious considering where this post is) woman in a committed heretosexual relationship. When I was younger, though I never truly believed in a god, I was a christian.

All my life I have constantly thought of who I will someday marry, lots of kids, and a career as an elementary school teacher. 

My major is dominated by young christian girls

I would love to be a housewife were I any good at cooking or cleaning. I love to knit, crochet, etc. I love gardening and flowers, cooking and baking, and I have a pretty lovely voice if I do say so myself. I sound like a Disney princess for crying out loud! 

Not to mention I have what everyone I meet calls birthing hips, almost childlike feminine features. Looking at myself and comparing my likes and figure to my religious friends, it's almost frightening to see how similar I am to them. I prefer to dress modestly and I am quiet and submissive in all forms. Hell, I'm even a submissive when it comes to kink.

It's unnerving to think of how easily I would fit in with my christian friends

Edit: Wow all of these responses have made me realize some things. 1. This sub is full of exceptional people who are very understanding and tolerant. 2. There is nothing at all wrong with me being an atheist and friends with a lot of christians nor is there anything wrong with me being a feminist and like stereotypical feminine things. 3. I shouldn't be so disapproving of myself or others simply for interests and beliefs. I'm very glad to be a part of such a great internet community.

Would the fact that I doubted

Here is the TAM Code of Conduct that has been printed in the front of this year's conference program:

""We want TAM Las Vegas 2011 to be a welcoming experience for everyone who attends . . .

Please respect your fellow attendees by not disparaging them based on unfair grounds such as race, and disability; and by not making uninvited sexual comments toward others.

If someone asks you to leave them alone or to otherwise stop a behavior that is directed toward them

Problems can be reported to TAM staff or volunteers who will bring it to the attention of JREF management. A warning will be given when appropriate, and unwanted intentional physical contact. 

Let’s make TAM fun for everyone!""

What more could we add to this to encourage reporting of sexual harassment? Maybe we can actually help our community instead of getting into this useless ""us vs them"" mudslinging that's been going on for so long now.

One of the most freeing things about leaving religion is the realization that there is no higher power judging you for your actions and waiting to punish you when you do wrong. For me, and that I am free to express my feelings for my significant other in any way I choose was a fantastic feeling! 

However, often calling me ""fast"" and, on one occasion, a slut. Keep in mind that I have only ever had sex with guys with whom I was in committed relationships, which IMO does not warrant such strong judgement. I've tried to explain to her that we just think of sex in different ways and that for me it holds no moral stigma; she just gives me a narrow-eyed look and drops the subject until she finds a future opportunity to comment and insult me once again.

I realize that I'm never going to change her mind and that the best I can hope for is a lack of comment. It just makes me sad that I can't come to my mom, but situations like this make me think that may not be the case.

I hear stories about sexism in the atheist movement

According to [PEW](http://www.pewforum.org/The-Stronger-Sex----Spiritually-Speaking.aspx), my pastor found out through facebook and called my parents to excommunicate me through them. Because I was a girl, I was still under the ""head of the household"" aka my dad, who was in charge of my spirituality. I purposefully waited for over a year to come out or be involved publicly because I knew this would happen. **women have a higher risk for leaving the church because their decision is more likely to be more difficult and affect other people very publicly and personally.**

In addition, soup kitchen, women's bible study, hospice, etc. Women in marriages or relationships will be strained because the husband might feel failed in his ""spiritual leadership."" When I was a Christian, all of my close friends were made at church. I lost ALL of them.  It was a very hard thing to go through. 

I know that a lot of these issues affect men as well as women

~~~
Backstory:
I was raised in a Fundamentalist Christian Republican home, I went to Church Camp, the whole nine yards. I was pretty into it; self-identified as a Jesus Freak. I was SO into the whole ""abstinence"" kink and I took it seriously!
My parent's only mistake was the reading they had available around the house; Encyclopedias, even a pretty collection of classical literature with matching leather covers and gold leaf from Socrates to John Locke (I might have been the only one to have actually opened the decorative literature). Suffice it to say that my morals began to diverge from god's especially in college, then I heard about Richard Dawkins via Penn Jillette's Radio Show. I decided to read The God Delusion with the knowledge that I would be forever changed by the end of it, either becoming the cockiest Christian known to mankind, or an Atheist. Well, here I am posting to /r/GodlessWomen 

~~~~
My problem:
Being raised so hardcore Christian, I'm okay with sex, and have explored it's many wonders and climaxes (thanks to my BF, a former porn shop employee, and Nina Hartely for your guides) but I really think I repressed myself pretty hard in my formative years. I don't anticipate sex, and usually don't get into the mood until physical clitoral stimulus is involved. I absolutely cannot get any enjoyment without a rather large toy which makes outdoor sex a no-go. 
What do I do?
Is this something I should go to a therapist about? A Sex-therapist (are they just phoney creeps?) or a Psychologist? Is there a resource

I had to leave, and felt awful about it, because she's lonely and no one visits her but myself, the only socialization she has is at church (3+ times per week), but I felt that she needed family. I am unwilling to debate with her, because it's like talking to a brick wall, and I don't want to cause her any more stress than she's facing right now. She already knows I'm an atheist, indoctrination

But when she talks about women being there only to serve men, and I will be damned if I ever let her believe this is her only worth.

Fox floods their local and national broadcasts with many stories liken to these stories:

* [Santa brings soldier dad home for Christmas](http://fox59.com/2012/12/19/santa-brings-soldier-dad-home-for-christmas/#9HUfA5mUoiyk5Ljy.99)  and 

* [Santa Claus brings a soldier home to his children](http://www.fox23.com/news/local/story/Santa-Claus-brings-a-soldier-home-to-his-children/2GZ-lzEzwE66or_-CnBmkA.cspx).

I just imagine those same children being told by their Father/Mother's to pray to Jesus to make sure their parent come home safe and sound.  Months go by and the prayers are not answered.  The Christmas season begins and the child asked Santa Clause to bring Daddy/Mommy home .... Poof! Wish Granted!!!

I am Atheist and my SO is Lutheran.  We don't have children, hand the stockings, put out the cookies and let's go to Mass.  Seriously!???!

I was raise a Jehovah's Witness and have very little memory of celebrating Christmas. So I have always been in the belief that Santa was make believe and as I got older I just continued to disregard all other imaginary beings (easy to do if you are raised a JW).

Santa brings Mommy/Daddy home, drinks my milk ... and yet you want me to believe in someone I have only seen in pictures?  I always wonder how a child believes in Santa (with all the perks) and then over time realize that Santa is fake while Jesus is real.

* What was your personal experience in believing and not believing in Santa?  
* What it a similar process of believing and not believing in God?  
* Where you shocked to find Santa isn't real?  
* Which took more time to recover the knowledge of non-existence Santa or God?

Thank you for your time in reading this ... it is my personal curiosity.

I have had altercations with this individual on multiple occasions when dealing with the bible. He'll make snide comments on atheistic posts then get offended if you say something on his posts about god. 

Once I posted a Laci Green video about sexism and gender roles. He said he agreed. When I talked about it he said that people shouldn't think that about men but he thinks women shouldn't be wearing that stuff and should wear skirts and that there place is in the home. Then he said he knew a girl who thought that

So apparently only virgins are real women worth any respect. Great. Worst part is we're working on a pokemon spin off together and he's my superior. He refuses to give me any assignments and just goes and tells me to learn the program.
