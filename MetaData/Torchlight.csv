The reason why the developers opened Torchlight to modding is so that YOU can play the game the way YOU want to play it.  And if you make a public game and someone joins that IS cheating

It's perfectly reasonable that you only want to play the vanilla game

It's also perfectly reasonable that people don't like to grind gear, or whatever, and feel like using cheats/respec potions/mods to help them progress at a faster pace.

Well why is that? The attack animation in both of the games are sped up or down so that the loop completes as the next attack can be started. The difference is that in Diablo the player can interrupt the animation almost instantly after the projectile is fired, the animation cannot be interrupted. The problem isn't very evident when using a bow or a crossbow, but the amount of 'air' pistols have in their animation is glaring.

The inability to interrupt an attack animation causes two problems: firstly

Well, while the Berserker mainly just has to attack, with the crit proc, shred armor, battle rage and the occasional shadow burst. Their mechanics for survivability aren't dependent on them being able to move around in combat as much as the ranged classes, especially the Outlander has to.

Letting the player interrupt the attack animation prematurely would lead to exactly one problem: you couldn't initiate an attack whenever you were moving. If you tried to attack before the attack timer had reset in Diablo 3

This wouldn't just have to be changes for the ranged attacks, it's not like you could inflict partial damage onto someone with a halberd and still have it pass through them in real life. This would give the melee characters more mobility when dealing with huge monsters with slow attack animations that are meant to be dodged. And on the whole, every class' spells would feel more responsive when cast mid-combat as they would execute sooner rather than later.

TL;DR: Players should be able to interrupt attack animations once the damage was dealt.

1349138389.0,10shpn,The case for Embermage: class mechanics for newbies,stigmate,120,19,52,"So you want to roll an embermage but you feel a bit overwhelmed by the amount of skills and how they are supposed to work? Here you will find a brief explanation of some key mechanics and how to use\not use them.

Stat:
--

* Focus: this stat increases your elemental damage

* Vitality: mages are squishy as hell

* Dex: just for the critical strikes.

Weapons:
--

Staves and wands are the key weapons for this class

* **Staves:** Staves are empowered by the passive [Staff mastery](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill?i=Staff%20Mastery): this talent will apply elemental armor debuff to all the target hit by either your staff itself (basic attack)

* **Wands**: Wands are seriouss business, Icy Blast and Shockbolts skills. The random effect can be, in no particoular order: bigass meteor, acid rain, vortex that blocks your foes, and many others. Wands are (very short) ranged weapons and can be dual wielded for additional badassery. Wand + shield is the perfect combo for veteran\elite.

Either of the two are viable

Skills:
---

Here comes the interesting part

Be aware: Although focus increases all elemental damage

**Examples:** 

* Weapon DPS skill: [Icy blast](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill?i=Ice%20Blast). As you can see
* Focus scaling skill: the infamous [Prismatic bolt](http://torch.light2armory.com/skill?i=Prismatic%20Bolt). It doesn't matter how badass your weapon damage is

Since you are going to dump 90% of your stat points into **Focus** as an embermage, but by gear also; on the other hand you only gain weapon dps through your weapon.

Both category benefits from + all damage


Now, staff mastery won't get into play at all.
This means no elemental armor debuff with prismatic bolt and staves

Basically: 

* if you are going to use focus-skills you are better off not taking either staff mastery or wand chaos at all

* Staff mastery and wand chaos complement theirself very well with all the weapon-dps scaling skill, arc beam, etc.

To conclude:
--

Now, and that would be furthermore empowered by passive talents (Staff mastery, chaos wand); one category that would perform better regardless of gear level instead, but would not yeld any bonuses upon using - as in no elemental armor debuff for example -; the former being the **weapon-dps skills like icy blast**, the latter being **focus-scaling skills like Prismatic bolt**.

I hope this will help you understand how to build a mage and how to use class mechanics at your advantage.

So I did a bunch of tests
_______

It is true that both of them **do NOT apply** Staff and Wand mastery


This is because they attack very fast

______

From my observations:

**Arc beam: 5 hits per second.**

**Shocking burst: 7.6 per second.**


Now you see why they don't apply on hit effects. If they did for example apply Staff mastery

_____


* It is very important to note that **those skills are affected by casting speed

With 100% bonus casting speed Shocking burst will be hitting 15 times a second

______

*   But **there is one on hit effect that is applied and that is  -x armor on hit.**

This means you don't need staff mastery to quickly drop the armor of enemies to 0

For example a level 36 gem removes 31 of all armor per hit for 5 seconds

______

* Also very important is that **those skills cost mana per second

So casting speed greatly increases your damage output (100% bonus cast speed = double **total** Arc beam damage) at no additional mana cost.


______
The tooltips are not clear enough and forget to mention some things.The % of weapon DPS listed in the toltip is damage per hit.
So it really means :

* Arc beam with no bonus casting speed does 50% of weapon DPS per second at rank 1
Also the flat electric damage listed is done 5 times per second.

It is also not mentioned that **Arc beam gains increased range with every rank**

* Shocking Burst with no bonus casting speed does 148% of weapon DPS per second at rank 1

Note that the electric damage this skill does is done over 1 second

Also note that the damage over 1 second primes Lighting brand and any of the 7+ attacks per second can activate the brand

Outlander build advice:

&gt;Outlander - Some comprehensive advices

&gt;Another thing about dex: 110 dex + max charge + max dodge mastery + max &gt;share the wealth yields max dodge (75%) for outlanders. In practice, unless &gt;you are using a shield build in elite hardcore.
&gt;Shotgun builds are hard
&gt;Oh, and vh (maybe shadowshot) transmits procs (% &gt;chance to cast a spell) and DOTs from your mainhand weapon, as well as &gt;shotgun mastery status effects.
&gt;Shattering glaive is exceptionally long range. You can use it to snipe dangerous &gt;things.
&gt;Venomous hail, but will use right hand dps. If you go focus and &gt;equip a wand in your right hand, you can do insane damage (and proc effects). &gt;Your gun just becomes a stat booster. Search for one with +crit damage or &gt;other &gt;stats. (Empyrean on the official forums developed this build, I'm making &gt;one as a hybrid glaive/chaos burst/VH focus build. Might have a guide up soon).
&gt;edit: Minimum viable cookiecutter glaivelander
&gt;Dex to 110 Foc all the rest Build focus first to gear
&gt;Glaive throw: 5 points
&gt;Rune vault: 1
&gt;Dodge Mastery: 15
&gt;Share the Wealth 15
&gt;Master of Elements: 15
&gt;Stone Pact: 15
&gt;Repulsion Hex: 5+
&gt;total points: 71 of 132. Everything else is optional. Cursed daggers is &gt;probably worth a full investment. Gear: wand+shield or double wand. &gt;+Focus, or focus if possible. At low levels, socket weapons with mana &gt;steal (act 2 rift ember will serve you well). Past Act 2-3, you should not be &gt;autoattacking ever.
&gt;spells: Concentration. All others are optional.

Stat and skill points issues:

You get 132 Skill points only 

You earn 5 stat points per level

Vitality is underpowered, vit or HP 

Dexterity has its diminishing returns, Surely the +% Critical Hit chance is good but you might not want to put many points beyong the above said  here

Focus and Str are points that will be raising the damage of your skills(if they are Weapon DPS% based they need STR

Now the reason why you shouldnt bother too much with your stat points is that, it is pretty common to have at least 200-250 points in every stat around lv 80

There are a few types of enchanters and the most important are

&gt;* **Jurick** (Puts a maximum of 2 sockets in your gear)
&gt;* **Borris**( Attribute enchanter

1349172612.0,10t5ya,Feedback from an experienced hardcore mode player.,Nukemi,102,19,83,"Hi

I love torchlight

I have died on several 50+ characters by now

However

I know how to build my characters

Every character i have died with has been instakilled so far

I've had decent resists (at least 2 slots of different armor embers in each slot) and still this is the way i go every time

The hardcore is near perfect on TL2

I do understand it is very nice that there is a challenge all the way from the beginning till end

The biggest problem is that, nothing can prepare me for this.

In other games, usually indicates that i need to be very careful with champions/bosses of that type i might encounter.

However, a boss appears and instakills me. And i can not do anything about it.

I think this requires a bit of tweaking

Thanks for reading!

Ps. I do not give a damn if i die really, it is hard to enjoy hardcore to the fullest.

1. Harmonix creates Guitar Hero

3. At some point, the publisher gets assimilated into the Voltron that is Activision, taking the rights to the Guitar Hero name along with it.

4. Activision takes a bunch of experienced developers from a different genre, despite being regarded by many as a soulless cash-in, with the personality of the first two games being replaced by something unmistakably corporate. The game smacks of a money-grab, what with all the product placement and Activision's policy of flooding the market with discs instead of releasing DLC. The launch is also plagued by technical issues (the Wii version had to be recalled because they accidentally mixed the whole game in mono).

5. Harmonix releases Rock Band. Its sense of style and personality

6. Harmonix releases Rock Band 2 and 3, without losing their own personality. Those games are now regarded by many as the true successors to Guitar Hero, and the new pinnacle of the genre. (The astronomical number of songs available as DLC doesn't hurt either.)

EDIT: Here's the list

    STABILITY
    *Fixed a potential crash bug when applying affixes and effects in certain circumstances
    *Fixed rare crash when turning in quest in the Undercurrents.
    *Put in protection against character save file corruption. Corrupted characters will not appear in the list of characters. (And thus can't cause the game to crash on load)

    SKILLS
    *Fix for Berserker geyser proc showing up as a mappable skill.
    *Fix for triggering Shocking Burst and Arc Beam out of range while hitting shift that could cause chain casting.
    *'Resist Slow' affix fixed.
    *Proc affixes scale better with player level.
    *Berserker 'Wolf Shade' now has the (intended) 60 second cooldown applied to all ranks.
    *Fix for mistriggering when chaining two skills together when there is an early hit-frame.
    *Safety check to stop any looping skills that get stuck in the 'on' state when the character is not performing a skill.
    *Fixed bug with 'Poison Burst' procs (they should properly engage at more distant ranges).
    *Fix for potential issue when units would queue removed/unavailable skills.
    *Fix for having more than 100% reduction to charge decay or a negative flat charge decay.

    PERFORMANCE
    *Made significant optimizations to particle collisions.

    SYSTEMS
    *Fix a bug when recalculating the price on objects to make sure the calculation is based on the correct data.
    *Fix for bug where rapid clicks could misspend stat points.
    *Removed access to console commands in multiplayer games.
    *The game's login dialog now correctly allows passwords up to 64 characters long.
    *Removed display of other users' IP addresses in multiplayer games.
    *Removed Steam Cloud toggle in the settings file (it didn't do anything); the ability to toggle is available in the Steam client.
    *Removed logging for achievements to potentially reduce some FPS drops for some users.

    LEVELS/SCRIPTING
    *Tweaks to various areas to prevent units from getting stuck.
    *Changed lootable rocks to be non-colliding as they could occasionally block very narrow corridors.
    *Fixes to some level scripting logic in the Frosted Hills.
    *Fixed a bug that could cause multiple Tower of the Moon entrances to appear in the world.
    *Implemented a few specific boss room pathing fixes.

    ACHIEVEMENTS
    *Fixed friends list based achievements.
    *Spell-learning achievements now don't incorrectly trigger based on other players.

    MINOR
    *Fixed several typos.
    *Improvements to journal tooltips.

Yet here we stand

As an added little bonus, right now: the /r/torchlight challenge runs. These will last for two weeks a piece and will normally start on Fridays, with the results due by the time the next challenge post is out. Our first week will be a relatively easy one. The shield only run. You must only have a shield equipped at all times, nothing in the other hand. Play on the highest difficulty and with hardcore mode on. When you die, take a picture of where you died and you character on the character select screen and we can all laugh at you or stare in awe of what you were able to accomplish. There will be special flair rewards to everyone who participates and an even more special one for those who manage to complete playthrough 1. I've also heard rumblings about actual tangible (not tangible, digital) rewards for whomever gets the farthest. More on that on Friday.

Tips for the challenge:

* If you want a generic sort of build

* Don't be afraid to try a new character on an easier difficulty to get your build right. You have two weeks and the game isn't that long

* Turn off auto equip items

* You can play however you want until you get a shield :)

Other stuff

* Try not to cheat. I am not going to go through everyone's skills and calculate if they respecced or if they hacked an item in. These are for fun

* Feel free to give me ideas for challenges. I have a couple rattling around in my head right now

* I'll post a thread next Friday that you can start putting results in

* Once again, I'll officially say welcome aboard now! I see that most of you are already acquainted here, but it's better late than never.

How where they gonna flesh out the world, immediately fell in love with it. My step son and GF both caught a glimpse and started playing too. We were playing so much we setup the Spare room to be the Torchlight room. I setup a dropbox with our stash files and with careful coordination and backup cycles we were able to share items with one another. 2 was announced and we couldn't have been happier with the simple idea of playing together.

Then it came out.. I had been out of work for nearly 6 months and I had to hear stories of all my friends enjoying it. So I did it! I pirated the game 2 days after release. I was going to set up a LAN with tunggle, terrible actually. Runic put a lot of work and soul into the game. The game is super fun, deep and amazingly priced. So I felt terrible about gypping them from money to pay their employees to keep making kick ass games. The fact I didn't have a job didn't justify me pirating it. It's a video game, a luxury item, so I should learn to do without.

Then I got a job! Nothing fancy but a simple web development project for a mom and pop shop here in my hood. So I just got paid today and with my 1st check I'm not only buy one but a 4 pack to share with my family. We are really stoked

I know there is the argument that chances are, felt genuinely bad, and bought the game to support a company. Sorry guys, didn't want to wait to play. Hope you can forgive me..

One of the most asked for features of this game was the offline/LAN modes. To make these modes happen, but at the same time they hate on the individuals who use the console or back up shared stash files. An important thing to understand is the trade-off that occurs between these two. Torchlight II trading away cheating security and any chance for legit competitive PvP or PvE for having an offline mode. All of these trade-offs are fine for what Torchlight wanted to do. It is a fun, casual, non-competitive action RPG.

1364530810.0,1b8364,Tip/Reminder: Enchanters will respawn along with enemies.,Xen0nex,54,7,0,"This may be common knowledge already

So, but somehow I got that idea in my head and there isn't really any info out there (that I've been able to find) that clearly tells you how it really works.  With how big a deal people were making of how rare certain Enchanters were, or rerolling worlds to keep looking for the same Enchanter, or ""parking"" an Enchanter with a Waypoint Portal, I just assumed it was the case.

So I did a quick little test last night

**Thus

**A.**  If you found the Enchanter in the Mapworks

**B.**  If you used a Vendor Boon Scroll and need to ""park"" him

To explain in **great unnecessary detail**

* If you encounter an Enchanter somewhere

* **Disenchanting** does **not** make him ""wander away"" (This has been very convenient with Fondo (who disenchants for cheap)

* Once you use him to enchant something, he disappears from the area.  (You can sort of work around this by placing a Waypoint Portal right next to him, and very quickly portaling in/out of the area before he gets a chance to walk offscreen, effectively ""**parking**"" him there.)

* **However**, Locked Golden Chests etc. when the area ""Repopulates.""

All areas in the game ""**Repopulate**"" after certain conditions are met.  ""Repopulating"" causes the following effects in that area:

* The map becomes fogged over / unexplored again

* All enemies/Champions/Bosses respawn

* Any regular or Locked Golden Chests reset

* Any collectible items in the area reset (E.G. the elemental crystals in The Sundered Battlefield)

* Any Enchanters respawn

* Any Shrines reset.  Notably

When an area ""Repopulates

* The shape of the map for the area remains exactly the same

* The locations that items/enemies/Enchanters were in are the same

* Which areas you are allowed access to remains the same (Unless unlocking it involves collecting items in that same area

* Your progress for any completed Quests

* The level of the enemies remains the same


It is important to note that an area where you have placed a Waypoint Scroll Portal will **NEVER** repopulate until you move your portal somewhere else.  It seems that placing a portal in Singleplayer mode, and vice versa, so be careful.  [Causing an area to ""Repopulate""](http://forums.runicgames.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=40118#p358478) depends on what type of area it is:

* For **Overworld** areas (The big huge places like The Temple Steppes, etc.), they will repopulate once you've entered at least 2 other Overworld areas.  

* For **Pass** areas (The short paths that connect you to Overworld areas like Crow's Pass, etc.), they will repopulate once you've entered at least 2 other Pass areas. 

* For **Towns**

* For **Dungeons** (Basically anything with only one entrance

Note that **Mapworks Maps** seems to basically count as Dungeon areas.  Since you can always revisit your last Map by clicking the bottom button at the Map Selector even without a Waypoint Scroll

By comparison, layouts, Champions, Rare Secret Dungeons on some Overworlds, Enchanters etc. in all of the areas of that character's world.  Rerolling only happens if you check the ""Reroll World"" box when starting an Internet or LAN game.  However, it is important to note that if you join another player's Internet/LAN game, your character inherits a copy of their world, which is much the same as a Reroll from your perspective.

Story time:
Dateline 1993.  Max Schaefer, which turns out to be hugely successful.  Blizz North then makes Diablo 2 and the expansion, before beginning work on two more games in the same vein as the Diablo games in 2003.  Just a few months into development of these games, several key members quit, and when the dust settled, 30 of the developers, including all of the higher-ups, Flagship and Castaway.  Neither company did particularly well, Max Schaefer, but needed funding

So, they try their hands at a couple of companies before getting back together to form their own studio, Runic, which made Torchlight.  Diablo 3 is NOT made by the developers behind Diablos 1 and 2**

  Edit - I've put in a support ticket with steam because I'm pretty sure it's them.  Either way I'm going to start adding people and gifting the 9 copies I DO have and If I get back later tonight and I can pickup the 10th before the sale ends I will and give it out to someone for sure.

A bunch of my friends who actually never played Diablo now bought Torchlight during the steam sale, and I'm not sure I want to bother with it if its a copy of a game I already own. Does it really bring enough to the table to be worth $15? On top of that how much better does the game play, if at all, than say Diablo or Torchlight 1. I played Torchlight 1 for a bit, got it in a bundle, but the lack of multiplayer made it pretty dull really fast, so also suppose I should ask how is the community on Torchlight 2?

1351450596.0,128asu,Torchlight II and difficulty: or why higher difficulties discourage dynamic gameplay,kazegami,58,16,37,"So I've started a good number of new characters (elite and veteran) recently

The major thing I've noticed is that the cooldown time for elite and veteran enemies is incredibly low

In the Mordrox battle, and I think this is a problem. It becomes a battle where your only choice is just to go directly for Mordrox and attack him incessantly, without any regard to what may be attacking around you, or really anything that is going on in your surroundings, and that kinda sucks.

Similarly, but what makes it truly terrible is the instant it dissipates it can be immediately recast. So you can go through whatever hoops you want to dodge the attack, but sucks to be you because it's going to be following you again in another millisecond. If you're an engineer or berserker, it's probably easy enough to just walk up to the caster and whack him to death and just soak the damage, but it becomes a realproblem for outlanders and embermages, where the one thing they rely on most is painfully ripped from them (running away).

Both are definitely manageable, there's not much else you can do."" I think the problem is definitely mitigated more for melee characters, and NG+ characters, because in the first case you are expected to be able to soak up damage coming at you from all angles, and in the other, by that time you have a variety of tools that provide buffs and abilities to not really *deal* with it, but I feel more like *circumvent* it entirely (i.e. abilities that pierce through enemies; homing attacks). This may in fact just be an issue related to newly born characters, but I think it points to a larger concern with combat in the game: the enemy relies very heavily on instant cooldowns, but I'll end it here.

After seeing a post a few days ago, being able to drag the item over the close button, you'd be able to drop the item on the ground.  I decided to go play with the vendors a bit and see what I could find out.

There is a way to know what you can get from the gambler every single time.

Steps to do so.

1. Open the gamblers shop.

2. Drag any item type you're interested in overtop of the buyback tab in the bottom right of the shop menu.

3. When you drop the item onto the buyback tab button
identified.

4. When you've dragged an item into the buyback tab and decided that's the item you want.  Simply drag the item off the buyback tab and onto the close button

The fight to the general was interesting. The scenery was detailed and colorful, I managed to push through to the end.

The boss was very large in size, allowing me to dodge them. He would randomly cause the ceiling to collapse, dealing AOE damage and dropping enemies into the room. These enemies were a mix of ranged and melee, some spawned other mobs, others had shields (which needed to be broken). It was a long drawn out fight, and I chugged a lot of mana potions to keep up my skill bombardment. I even found myself equipping other weapons I picked up earlier in the cave, just to boost my DPS. Eventually I took the guy down

One of my gripes in Diablo 3 is that all the boss fights suck(except maybe the butcher). Even the Lord of Terror is a dumbed down version from Diablo 2. They took away his best offensive attacks and replaced them with *teleport*. Once I beat normal difficulty and started trudging through act 2 on nightmare (decked out with rares from the AH, only 6 of them were worth using, and those skills had only 1-2 useful runes. The solution to every encounter was spamming my nuke ability. Everything on screen would die in 2-3 hits. There was literally no depth to the game, no challenge.

Back to Torchlight. I turned in the General quest and chose an epic mace as my reward. My weapon DPS went from 30 to 140 in that one quest. When I ventured out into the next area, because enemies were still quite capable of kicking my ass, even though I was stronger. I also had to fight more enemies at once. It was a nice balance of things, because I got to feel more powerful while the game also became more challenging.

I'm becoming a Torchlight convert very quickly. There's just so many little things that are noticeable, catching fish in a pond that will turn your pet into random monsters with different effects, or walking up to a little cave and having wolves jump out to attack you, or being able to weapon swap, etc. These are all little things that I've noticed in the first hour of play.

I'm going to pre-order Torchlight 2, I would gladly choose the latter. Even though I mistakenly chose the former. &gt;_&lt;

With the release of the game I am planning on opening a couple other subreddits that I am grooming now

**Changes to /r/torchlight**

My intention is to keep this as the general one. I would like the quality of the posts to stay high

* No trade threads

* No ""silly content."" By which I mean no image macros, basically anything that would be at home at /r/asongofmemesandrage.

* Implementation of an image post standard much like the one that I instituted over at /r/bindingofisaac. [Here's a link to the post where I discuss them over there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/ya0c5/new_image_post_standards/)

* No co-op partner searching threads 

**New Subreddits**

&gt;**/r/torchlighttrade**
&gt;
&gt;This will be the general place to organize trades of items. My proposed rules are as follows:

&gt;* Please format your trades as [H] brief item description [W] brief item description. 

&gt;* Images must be included in every post.

&gt;* If you are really uncomfortable with making a trade

&gt;* If you find a post in violation of the rules

[ ](/s)

&gt; **/r/torchlightmemes**

&gt;This will be the catch-all for that silly content I mentioned earlier. Not sure about rules here if there even are any needed.

That's the master plan, hence this post. Tell me how I go too far/don't go far enough below. Also: if anyone has problems with how everything is organized after launch, I have /r/truetorchlight and /r/torchlightloot available for use when they are needed.

1. Everyone says something they want in the letter
1. everyone votes
1. top 20 posts make it into the letter
1. Everyone who submits gets their name at the end of the letter as if they had signed it. If you have nothing to add to what has been said but want to sign submit '**asdf**' and I will add your name to the letter.
1. I format it and sent it to Runic sometime on October first.

If this idea sucks give me a better idea or input on how to make it better. Please PM me suggestions so that the submissions for the letter are not cluttered. I will make changes to the OP with credit to the suggester if desired.

If you want to send runic a screenshot of your character upload it to imgur and I will do what I can to get them organized into some sort of pretty collage without making them indescribable as characters. (a load of cropping will probably be done on my part. Please PM me if there's something in your Screen shot besides your character that you DO NOT WANT CROPPED [ie: pets, other players, rocks you thought looked cool, ect.])

* Don't stray too far away from the group. If there are 4 to 6 people in game then it's probably better to avoid a large clusterfuck, and if there are no enemies, it's easy to assume they've already been there when they actually haven't.

* Also

* Along the same lines

* If you can manage it, and for whatever ridiculous reason, players may have to go through several load screens before they can get back to where they were. Waiting a bit makes sure they haven't been deprived of XP or loot, especially if it has been a particularly tough fight and they died towards the end of it.

* Don't join games in which you'll be severely over leveled. If your level is much higher than other players' that means you are probably brutally murdering everything. Sometimes this isn't a big deal

* Be considerate when joining a game in which you are under-leveled. If you're dying a lot, other players may not be as eager to go back and do quests that you may be behind on. However, most players are totally okay with this in my experience.

* I really recommend not joining games if your character is a low-level but wearing extremely high-level armor and using high-level weapons.. It's irritating in a very similar way to high-level players joining low-level games. It's also sometimes very suspicious....

* Obviously modded clients and cheated gear or whatever will also make your fellow players uncomfortable

I like builds that focus only on a few specific skills with tons of passives to back them up, you can deal with crowds or single targets easily, and with the right tank pet (crabs, always crabs, crabs for life) you can deal with literally any problem the game throws at you.

Seriously give the build a shot

1.)Find a phase beast portal (preferably in the frosted hills or ossean wastes as these phases are easy with around 10k gold each time)

2.)Enter the phase and finish the task but do not leave the phase once you finish.

3.)Log out to loading screen and Log back in.  You will notice you are still in the phase and the phase has reset.

You keep the gold/ items from the previous phases and can do this indefinitely till you die of boredom.

1368824786.0,1ejhl7,The Legit and Boring Gold Farming Guide,Cassirer,38,8,5,"So if you feel guilty exploiting the phase beast portal reset trick to get lots of gold

This is assuming you’re at least level 50 and have beaten the game once. 

Go to mapworks

* Ezrohir maps spawn lots of little enemies that make for easy kills. Flying copters

* Lots of secret rooms and lots of golden chests. The Catacomb maps have similarly a large number of secret rooms

* Try to buy maps that are 5-10 levels lower than your character level. Gold drops aren’t heavily level dependant

Now

Things that help:

* Lucky Coins (they range from +1~6%, it’s worth it.

* Demoza Skull (+6% gold found)

* Treasure Hunter (spell)

* Barter (spell)

* Filip the Lucky (enchant+disenchant until you get +% gold drops if you have the money

Things that **REALLY** help:

* Argonaut armor pieces

* Nephanic Skull (+20% gold found!)

* Anything else that gives high +%Gold drops (e.g. The Triskelion Fragment, Blatand, Rohac's Comic Boots, etc)

My gold farming engineer runs Argonaut+Celestial Armor pieces with 2 sockets blinged out with Nephanic skulls and Loaded- er Lucky Coins

Even if it’s not a secret room

Other tips if you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel for enchanter fees:

* Sell everything. Those potions taking up slots in your pack which you rarely use? Sell them in bulk. A x99 stack of Ultimate Potions goes for around 6k. Rare loot which other characters might be able to use it? Cash it

* Destroy all pots and urns and root through everything on the map. A surprising number of barrels or rocks will drop a bucketload of gold into your face because someone obviously stashed their life savings there before dying (what else would all those Dead Adventurers do before kicking it?)

* If you die, particularly as you accumulate more gold, and you shouldn't be under any particular time constraints. 

* Finally

This build is based on being level 42+. Yes I've used respec potions and will continue to do so. Leveling into this build is a lot harder. After 42+ it gets a LOT easier. My advice is to use whatever kills the fastest up until that point

Also note that this is based off a final min/max build

***Ending build explanation: (skills)***

*Blitz Skill Tree:*

**Emberquake**: 15/15 points - Great skill that hits multiple mobs, and emberquake in the middle.  KEEPING THIS UP AT LATER LEVELS REQUIRES A LOT OF MANA POTS!!!!!  I cannot stress that last part enough :P  Its rough, but to me worth it.

**Onslaught**: 15/15 points - Replacement for shield bash.  Very accurate movement and amazing debuff.  Onslaught into a group and emberquake them to death!

**Ember Hammer**: 1/15 points - Must have skill.  Those annoying enemies later on with shields?  One hit with this breaks them and makes for easy kills.  Has a large hit area

*Construction Skill Tree:*

**Healing Bot**: 15/15 points - the skill name says it all.  The little bot follows you around

**Bulwark**: 15/15 points - required for anyone going tank build.  the skill adds armor and gives great damage reduction.

**Fire and Spark**: 15/15 points - adds fire damage which only buffs your emberquake.  must have.

**Charge Domination**: 6/15 points - this is really just one of those moments where I don't know where to put my final few points.  It makes it kind of annoying that the skill points don't even out.  But this should give roughly a 5% chance when an enemy is killed to fully fill your charge up.  Awesome if it works

*Aegis Skill Tree*:

**Forcefield**: 15/15 points - this skill will help keep you in god mode if you keep this up and have Aegis of Fate constantly going off.  Also shields allies which helps the squishier classes.

**Immobilization Copter**: 5/15 points - this is an amazing skill.  it follows you around slowing targets.  With five points in this

**Aegis of Fate**: - 15/15 points - AMAZING skill.  this plus forcefield are pretty much god mode.  when you shield bash into 10+ enemies the chances of this going off at 15% are very high

**Charge of Reconstitution**: 15/15 points - heals anyone?  the great thing about this is, forcefield protects you from further damage, while this heals your missing life.  this is why i love to have forcefield as the only charge skill.  both work amazing together.

-------------------------------------------------------

Common skill questions from comments:

**Why not use Flame Hammer instead of Emberquake?**

*When testing, but when testing it I saw a few issues.  Flame Hammer does a couple things I dont like.  First off the way it hits the ground, and projectiles go searching for enemies.  It doesnt track nearly as well as emberquake, and doesnt put off nearly as many splinters as emberquake does.  Now Flame Hammer has a chance to do two additional blasts if it uses a charge.  The issue with this is, the actual additional blasts get pushed out too far in front of you, and again just dont track enemies well.  I don't see it hitting nearly as hard as emberquake, and another downside is it actually uses charges.

**Why not use sword and board?**

*I simply see it as this.  If I have a shield with 200 armor.  Max sword and board gives you 90% of that armor to weapon DPS.  So that adds 190 weapon DPS for 15 skill points of mine.  That doesnt give me nearly enough.  If you are going for max DPS over being able to survive, you want to survive.*

**Stats**:

Honestly theres very little to say here.  You will want to do your stats based on needed gear.  you wont need higher level vitality for higher level armor until level 30+

I will say that you will possibly want to invest a little bit into focus for mana

**Gear**:

You will be looking for +fire damage gear, ive always used a fast weapon to spam it as much as possible.  maybe having both available is good.

One thing I noticed

In general I look for armor that has a few main attributes.  Highest armor value &gt; life &gt; fire dmg % &gt; weapon dmg %.

Socketing the gems that give 3% Damage reduction in your armor can amount to an easy 30% extra DR

**Pet**:

Please don't forget to utilize your pet.  put him as straight DPS.  when you get spell scrolls, not defensive.

After you start to do more DPS than your pet, treasure hunter, etc. ( i believe treasure hunter spell works on pet? )

**Update 1**: added pet info.

**Update 2**: updated with new confirmed max skill points of 132.  added new information on why this skill over that in regards to comment feedback.  tested using respec potions in game @ level 55+ versus level 75+ maps

**Update 3**:  Changing shield bash for onslaught.  Shield bash seems to be bugged

**Update 4**:  Added new leveling info.  TL;DR use respec potions at level 42 :)

Hope you like it

I think TL2 is one of the best games to come out in a while, and having played Diablo II thousands of hours. The community is certainly not to the masses that D2 was, but I do remember for a period TL2 was getting more attention that D3. And it seems now it is dying down a bit. Certainly plenty of people still play with friends. I do, but I still miss being able to join a game easily.

And why? Because to join a modded game as a person who plays with mods I need to sort through that giant INCONVENIENT drop down menu list of mod configurations. 90% of which are synergies mod servers! Almost half the time of which for some reason wont even show up in the list when i try to find the single server with that specific mod configuration, and always time consuming to find. And I even tried  making a vanilla character but alas, it seems almost everyone plays with mods. I can only find a few vanilla games.

TL2 NEEDS a new server browser. I feel they should just have a simple check box, maybe even a lot. So dev's if you see this PLEASE PLEASE take into consideration! I love your game and I want to see it live on and prosper in the online community! And if players agree please please upvote! Or repost this idea on Runic's forums! Or anywhere else!

First of all, but sadly you can't kite really well in TL2. I don't know why, but moving between casts always feels like a gamble. I can't control my char as I want to which cost me a few of my deaths.

The amount of Rares is high enough for me

I loved collecting the sets tho. I got a full Blue Set and I'm now working on Emberweave and Winters Reach. I don't know if I will wear them when I complete them

I sadly didn't found a Legendary yet. I know they are supposed to be really rare

The Embermage itself is an awesome character in my opinion. There was only one Skill in the skilltree which I regretted skilling. Firebombs just didn't work for me and I threw them out of the rotation. I won't do the same mistake with my next Embermage which I'll try to focus on Dex. 

I won't try to compare the game to Diablo 3

On a side note. I hate it that Immolation Aura turns off when you enter a new zone and I hate it that you can't take the quest with the robot parts with you through game modes. Why isn't that possible?

Thank you everyone for participating! Most of all, so while you may not have won a copy of Torchlight 2, I hope you know that you still impacted a kid in a meaningful way. To do something for me, that's great. But to do something for my kids -- thank you seems small. Regardless, a huge THANK YOU again for your submissions. I uploaded an Imgur album showing a few of my kids' responses to your submissions. You made a difference (whether you meant to or not), so thank you! :) :) :)

You do not need Internet in order to play it and you can choose to play in a LAN if you want. I see a lot of new folks around here so I just wanted to share a couple of pointers.

1) Torchlight 1 is cheap

2) Torchlight II is really fun but some people are disappointed because it might become a little bit to repetitive at the later levels

3) You can always MOD the game

4) There's no respecc system without ""cheats"" or MODS

5) A lot of classes can have an insane amount of different builds

1349266350.0,10vczr,Does anybody else feel like the skill and class design is by far the weakest point of this game?,,55,34,68,"... which is a shame because almost anything else is so good.

My biggest problem with this game is more of a general thing but still related to the skills. It's the god damn spell animations. This game is so fast paced. *Why can't I animation-cancel*. *Why does every animation have to take two years to finish*. It just makes the skills feel not very fun to use and feels so out of place compared to the pace of the game. The rest of the combat is actually pretty fluid but the animations make it feel so awful.

Next up is the actual skills. Even disregarding the spell animations, I think a lot of this is done to the awful spell animations and the fact that skills in this game have *very* low range. You can't even see the mobs until you are pretty much right in their face.

Then we get to the overall class design. I could spend a lot of time picking this apart but I think that if you've played a lot of other RPG's before

A good example would be the Embermage. 2 out of 9 passives are downright useless unless you use one of the base spells (out of which only Prismatic Bolt is really good) which scale of weapon DPS. To a new player this will never be apparent and he'll probably spend a bunch of points into mostly useless passives. That's just not good game design.

Another example would be the Outlander. This is a more subjective opinion but it really feels like a failed experiment between a hunter and a mage. Autoattacking

Ok I've been ranting on for way too long. But hopefully you get the point I'm trying to make.

**TL;DR: The spell animations in this game are awful. The skills don't feel very satisfying to use. The overall class design isn't done very well. Don't get wrong though I want this game to be good. The rest of it is bloody awesome. I just can't enjoy a game when my character doesn't feel satisfying to use.**",self,t5_2rb10,1349266710.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10vczr/does_anybody_else_feel_like_the_skill_and_class/

The downside to this, in Act 2 there is a boss with a gigantic rock golem that summons walls of rock everywhere.  The rocks are timed to disappear in X seconds.  But if you're kiting the boss around, the rocks he spawned way back when don't despawn.  So when you have to turn around, you'll run into tons of rocks that still have their full duration on them even though they've been on the ground for minutes.  On the same boss, even shooting long range shots is difficult -- with Blast Cannon, I found that I had to come significantly closer than max range in order for my shots to hit.  The boss would leave render range otherwise, and just sit there until I walked a bit closer to him.  I believe this is because the game only renders a monster if his entire frame is within render distance

I wonder if this is the same for multiplayer -- I would assume not, the two boss-adds (unintentionally) de-rendered and I ended up soloing the main boss without any issues.

Anyone have thoughts on this?

There are a few new things

First things first: Co-op partner threads. I'd thought that Torchlight 2 was going to be Streamworks for whatever reason (probably Borderlands 2 on the mind) and that led to my decision of using the Steam group for looking for groups. It turns out it doesn't use Steamworks, sort to new. I'll probably post the first one later today, so if anyone needs to get the jump on that they can. 

Second: I've implemented [spoiler tags](/spoiler ""Not actually a ""). Use these often. I'll be removing any improperly marked posts I see. There is also link flair for the threads. When you submit a post, report it. It'll be a lot quicker to just remove them all in my modqueue than search through every thread. 

Speaking of Runic employees making terrible mistakes: we have four resident runic employees that you may have seen. They are clearly distinguishable by the big Runic and Runic emblem by their names. If you can't see the Runic emblems, /u/bellawonder, and /u/devjustinian. 

Finally: a little generic troubleshooting. If you can't see spoiler tags, turn on your subreddit styles! If you have RES it will be above the unsubscribe button, if you don't you'll have to go into your preferences and allow subreddit styles.

r/torchlighttrade seems to be pretty dead so I thought we might try doing a consolidated trading thread here that we would change every week.  That way we've got way more visibility and hopefully more people getting the things that they need.  A few quick things:

No one can know if your items are legitimate or not

Don't spam this post with the same listing again and again.

If you find a trader who is fast easy and dependable feel free to respond to your thread with positive feedback so we get a list of trustworthy players.

Other than that

EDIT:  Thanks to a brilliantly simple suggestion from iisten if possible, why do you need to trade with people who would prefer to play the game as it was meant to be played.

Diablo 3 has been stale for a long time

Torchlight 2 should be Diablo 3's model for itemization. Itemization is so deep and there's a lot of things you can do with your items. I LOVE the Items Meta Game!

e.g. I got a Level 17 Unique Polearm with 1 socket. Would you believe that this Polearm has been very useful to me up to Level 36? I love the ability to enchant the items with additional affixes!

Wow I can't believe Diablo 3 doesn't have this feature. There was supposed to be an Enchantress NPC in D3 that is supposed to give additional item affixes

1. I LOVE the vast maps of Torchlight.

2. I LOVE that the maps are NOT ONLY have RANDOMIZED PATHS

3. I LOVE the itemization system.

4. I LOVE the Music. Matt Uelmen is the most epic atmospheric music composer in the history of gaming.

5. I LOVE the Combat System, Sockets, Recipes.

Storm Burst, Charge Domination in pretty much every spec. 1 point in Ember Hammer if you're using a melee weapon to destroy shields.

Fast forward a while later. I full-clear the map, I head toward Emberworks. Just as I am about to enter, I notice that Notches Mine is   on my map. I was 100% certain it was not there before, and 100% certain it was there now. I decide to finish Emberworks first before I go kill creepers. Well, I died, so I warped back to find that the cave was gone again.

With a lot of experimenting

* Go to town, exit the game
* Open the game
* Check your map. If it's open, and try again

The reason I think this may be a bug is because you can enter the mine fine, if you find the mine normally on a fresh reroll, you leave through the door you came in and the mine persists.

1365077157.0,1bnm5e,Anyone else worried that Multiplayer will be extremely splintered with the GUTS Mod system?,Xen0nex,23,4,15,"Hi, at least the way I've been led to understand it

Please correct me if I'm wrong(And I really hope that I am)

With the old system I used a Shared Stash mod, all of which only affected my client.  I was able to easily play online with others using Vanilla, or using any Mod that **didn't** change something game-wide (Like adding new classes, new skills, etc.)

I'm still trying to either find or make GUTS versions of those mods, and nothing else.  Furthermore, the mods will need to come from the same source (e.g. If I'm using my homemade conversion of the Sharedstash Mod, but someone else uses an 'official' version the author creates later, even if they are identical, they will be incompatible).

**EDIT (I checked out the Steam Mod store):** This problem is exacerbated by the fact that there already seem to be several mods in the Steamworks site that do almost exactly the same thing.  E.G. Out of the half-dozen Inventory/Stash Mods, everything else is the same), and one of *those* has a regular and a ""Lite"" version.

If you're into using either combinations of mods, I can only see this translating as, 

* **If you want to play online

*****

Do I have an accurate view of the new system

I don't know what the best way to address this would be.  Could possibly a separate tier of Mods be made: ""**Clientside Mods**"" to include things like Shared Stash Mods or cosmetic UI mods that only affect the client and therefore shouldn't be incompatible with Vanilla / most other mods?

Does damage reflect reduce damage by X or does it just damage a monster for X every time they damage you (similar to how thorns works in diablo)?  

Does it take effect before or after resistances?  

So from my understanding different ways it could work are as follows. Lets assume we have 50 damage reflection:

A.

 -Player is hit for 100 damage  

-Damage reduced by 50 

-Monster takes 50 damage

-Damage reduced by physical armor   

-Damage reduced by physical damage reduction %

B.

-Player is hit for 100 damage

-Damage is reduced by physical armor

-Damage is reduced by physical damage reduction %

-Damage is reduced by 50

-Monster takes 50 damage

C.

Damage is not reduced at all and the monster simply takes 50 damage.

    





Option A seems good


Option B


Option C seems pretty worthless.",self,t5_2rb10,1349769958.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/116qkj/how_does_reflect_damage_work_in_torchlight_2/
1349151882.0,10sulg,No-Dex Outlanders??,CobaltBlue,24,7,42,"I was somewhat dismayed as I was playing my Outlander, Engineers can mostly ignore dexterity. So I thought about it.

I've come to the conclusion after some testing and thinking that the Outlanders ""ignore stat"" is actually dexterity! 

**Reasoning**, *not* some specific build that doesn't use attacks X, Y, or Z, in favor of only using A, B, and C:

**Strength** improves crit damage.

**Strength** can improve damage from the following skills:

* Most ranged weapon attack (left click) damage
* Burning Leap*
* Chaos Burst
* Flaming Glaive*
* Glaive Sweep*
* Poison Burst*
* Rapid Fire
* Rune Vault
* Shadow Shot
* Venomous Hail*

**Focus** improves chance to Execute with dual weapons.

**Focus** can improve damage from the following skills:

* Magical weapon attacks such as wands and extra elemental damage on other weapon attacks
* Bane Breath
* Bramble Wall
* Burning Leap*
* Cursed Daggers
* Flaming Glaives*
* Glaive Sweep*
* Glaive Throw
* Poison Burst*
* Sandstorm
* Tangling Shot
* Shattering Glaives
* Venomous Hail*
* Vortex Hex




**NOTE* that some skills (those with asteriks) are improved by both STR and FOC! Also

**Vitality** obviously keeps you alive when you get hit and you have to put some into vitality  no matter what your build is.

What does **Dexterity** do for the Outlander though? Dodge chance is nice, there are no outlander mechanics that proc on crit or anything. Fumble recovery is also nice, but unnecessary. Dex also lets you equip weapons earlier than their level. 

AND THAT'S IT. It doesn't increase damage significantly except through crit chance

I hate how counter-intuitive this seems. I instinctively started putting points into Dex from the get-go on my Outlander because it's a ranged class and all the ranged weapons require dex to equip

Do you guys agree? (Though please don't tell me that *your* special build only uses wands and a magic attack

[Here is the forum post where he goes into detail about things](http://forums.synergiesmod.com/index.php?topic=2763.0)

Combine the all has had quite a few updates to it

-So Death's Grim Gate is a mod by Bandit that makes Dying a little more interesting by throwing in 12 random death events into the mix instead of the 3 choices you usually have. It's a nice addition for those that feel choosing your fate is too lenient but permadeath is too harsh.

-The Recnam Rising mod is a new quest line in the Estherian Enclave that has a full story in it already and the author says he's got a lot more coming. I like what's already in it and I'd definitely recommend it!

-Last but certainly not least is the Dragonus. The Dragonus is a polearm centric class but has several other builds as well. All of the skills seems to be there but the class is in it's alpha stages so expect lots of tweaks in the future. The class is playable and not too OP'd at the moment but something needs to be done about it's quest drops (it's hard to make a lance character if you never get any stinking lances)

My main probably will be an outlander ... great set of skills love the shotguns

The mage i found to be one of the most weird skilled one ... i mean i understand probably that bottom line you want the Charge-up passive at max to be able to spew skills at no cost ... but from my perspective it didn't last that much ... and most of the time i would end up with no mobs to spend the skills after i downed them all just to charge it up

The engineer i realized was the 2hd weapons god ... like my first char was a berserker and i was a bit disappointing that i wanted to go heavy weapons and it was specialized on claws ... which is great though i thought of him in a more barbarish kind of way ... but look no further the Engineer has what it takes to scratch that 2hd big arc itch that you want ... :D loved it .... 

Berserker ... this is a more fast paced character ... didnt get him to 21 cos i made an engy after i hit 15 with him i think ... but i thought his charge-up was the coolest ... every hit you deal after the bar is filled is a 100% crit ... which is awesome ... 

Bottom line:

Mana per hit is a great affix to find ... be it on weapons or prolly on soketable stones ... which are in a great variety ... Also mana pots are not as common as health pots and the charge is progresive rather 15 mana per every hit ... which i found to be a lot :)

Shotguns are AWESOME! great firepower

Its a great game and i'll buy it as soon as its out :D

So only about 8% of players who beat the game are playing on elite.  I found this very surprising given my experience playing through.

My question is:  Is there a practical reason why that figure is so low?  Am I better than I thought I was compared to average Joe?  Is there no loot difference so people just don't care?  Do people prefer to be under-challenged to avoid death related stress?  Has the general ARPG skill level dropped since it has become a less popular genre compared to 10-15 years ago?

However, the console combatlog doesn't even list DoTs at all (please correct me if I'm wrong.  Reading that thing is like trying to learn a new language)  So going just by the little icon tooltips above the combat dummy in town, everything seems to be behaving as expected, except for two things:

* My Fire DoT is doing **way more damage than it should** and I don't know why.

* My Ice DoT *does* deal the damage I expect

Again, [**here is what happens**](http://i.imgur.com/BWrY7ba.jpg) when I shoot the dummy once, and [**here is what happens**](http://i.imgur.com/WNsRLFm.jpg) after I shoot it continuously for 10 seconds.

Passives - Blood hunger - ALL THE POINTS

Actives - Shadow Burst - ALL THE POINTS, this little baby right here Battle Standard...and yes, ALL THE POINTS (although getting just tier 2 bonus would be enough I guess)

The thing that was frustrating me the most on my berserker was that I was almost always mana starved. I'd been putting points between strength, I've been biased towards Strength a LOT more than Dex.

So first and foremost...I firmly believe that every single berserker out there (yes every single one, charge generation and if you get the Tier 1 bonus, Mana Regeneration. It starts you off with 24 mana over 4 seconds and just keeps improving (I'm at 30 mana per 4 seconds atm).

This is HUGE. So huge that I am able to stand in one spot and keep Eviscerate pressed and spam that thing till the cows come home...and my mana globe doesn't even show a decrease

Losing health you say? You have Shadow Burst maxed out (I'm currently getting 40% of my total HP back from each cast as long as I hit 4 mobs with it)...spam that 3 times and you just got your entire HP bar (and then some) back.

The nice thing is

Also, 4 sec timer applies. If you dash back in and run out again real quick, the 4 sec timer is refreshed...no diminishing returns.

My play-style is basically me running around with a giant cannon AOE stunning and blinding mobs with Blast Cannon. The only thing I spend charges on is Forcefield which helps tremendously in all situations. I have a Tier I Heal Bot that is fairly useful

Since I rarely spend charges as an engineer I decided to abuse how tanky Forcefield makes me in a real big way

Although, hits like a truck, blinds them, stuns them and knocks them back. 

Right now I have a single point in Charge Reconstruction, Gun Bot, and Seismic Slam. I *really* wish I could remove my points from Seismic Slam and Shock Grenade since I never use them and will probably never need to since my normal attacks stun enemies so frequently. 


_______________________________


I find the engineer to be pretty damn strong and honestly wonder how the other characters measure up to him. I'm ranged yet I'm not squishy at all, and my bread and butter spell, Blast Cannon, does a good chunk of damage and goes through units.

I'm strongly considering creating a paladin class mod for Torchlight II, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm in for, but I'm willing to give it a good effort, and hopefully it will see the light of day as a balanced, functioning character.  If I can't manage it, I will gladly pass on whatever progress I make to an experienced modder who would be willing to finish it.  

I'm looking for ideas for the charge mechanic

**Paragon/Templar**:  A defensive skill tree focusing on shields and one-handed weapons.

**Divine**:  A blend of offensive and defensive skills with some medium range spells and group buffs (holy bolt

**Zealot/Crusader**:  An offensive-focused skill tree specialising in two-handed weapons for maximum fun and damage.  

Any input would be greatly appreciated, and resources for creating this mod.  I understand that Runic will be releasing a new version of TorchED for Torchlight II, so I'm not sure how much concrete information is available; I'm mostly focusing on nailing down the core concept and abilities at this point anyway.

I've actually been very excited for this since really liking the first

First things first graphically, snowy and sometimes piratey world! It's a leap up from Torchlight artistically and technically. It makes a world worth exploring and explore you most certainly will (segway ftw)

Torchlight had size issues, for example in one snowy area I was one minute fighting Skeletons, to then ghosts and then onto human bandits. One issue is that perhaps quests are spread too thin among a relatively big world. Could also do with more skeleton pirates - they are the best kind of pirates.

Combat was another thing that recieved it's fair share of complaints in Torchlight and thankfully it's been pretty much fixed. The combat in TL2 is fast, that is fucking awesome. Only problem however is that the explodefest that is my glaive is pretty much the only ability I use, I don't really need to use much else to get through combat. Whether that's changed further on or more likely it's because I'm a wimp and on normal. Overall though, left clicking to kill is pretty damn fun in TL2.

One thing that does need tweaking is mana potion drops, plenty of rares and uniques were about, this was couple with a good number of ""elite"" mobs which made for a rewarding experience!

1357154962.0,15u9ow,"My Embermage Prismatic Build ""The Farmer"" ",stevonf,21,9,22,"Edited this post based on some great suggestions from **tetracycloide**

Warning: I am using this build on ELITE level. 

This is a great farming build for mapworks as its almost too easy and you can do high level maps at earlier levels. 

Prismatic Build: 

I was level 70 and doing all mapworks maps (even lvl 105 though I died one hit quite a bit when caught).  The 86-95 maps were a breeze. Think I am lvl 82 now and everything is a breeze. 


**TL:DR** 

Here is the build showing skills



http://torchlight2armory.com/skill-calc?i=2#gBqqkSATSYwCEfU7k_u7tBc5wB3Bl6eVD-nfhMbJWpe3

**Skills**







Prismatic Bolt: Tier 2 bonus. 10 points


(mana is no issue folks!my charge bar is full in like 4-5 casts anyway. I find Teir 2 is the sweet spot to never have a mana issue



Charge mastery: 10




Elemental Boon: 10



Immolation Aura: MAX (full time 15% damage reduction- thanks **tetracycloide**)


Deaths Bounty: MAX ( Provides health and mana which you likely will not need but it doesn't hurt. Also slows enemies down which is a big help to this build. Also provides some stun at high levels) 

Hailstorm: MAX ( Has a high chance to stun and freeze mobs


Fire Brand: MAX

Ice Brand: MAX

Lightning Brand: MAX

Astral Ally: 10  (great guy at later levels

Frost Phase: 1 Point (necessary to get out of trouble with this squishy build


**Optional Skills**: In my opinion



Frozen Fate (optional): 1 point is nice to have a chance to freeze mobs



Ice Prison (optional): 1 point is great to keep enemies distanced and then dead


Prismatic Rift (optional): Not a bad skill for a couple of points although with this build its almost useless because if your farming higher level maps your a one hit quit anyways. 


**Stats**

Since your using prismatic bolt your weapon dps and all that great stuff doesn't really mean squat. So you need to concentrate on boosting your focus stat. 

I put 3-4 points into focus every level and put the others in Dex/Vit

I think I am about 400 focus, 50 Str

Focus is most important as it boosts your mana and your direct prismatic bolt damage and magic damage (the effects like burn

A bit of dexterity and vitality and strength does not hurt though as Dex will help your dodge and crit

**Gear**

Note: Weapons will be covered later

My gear is all aimed at these things:

+Attributes (Enchanters are great for this! Save your money for Attribute/Socket Enchanters). I tend to try and boost my DEX/STR on my gear so my critical hit change and damage bonus go up. Once you are at full charge you are hitting crits all over the place. Especially when you factor in the weapon bonuses (covered later) 

+Cast Speed (The most important) 


+Charge Rate (Very important)


* + Elemental damage % (recall prismatic bolt does all 4 elemental damages and gets boosted by elemental attunement) 


+Crit damage and chance % (Not very important but doesn't hurt if you have room to spare)

**Weapons**

I have 2 setups on my Weapon 1/Weapon 2 slots


1) Weapon and Shield-  I use a weapon and shield in one of my slots for situations where I might need that block chance to survive. Also my shield gives me +20% cast rate which is HUGE!

2) Dual weapons- My other slot has dual weapons (notice I am not saying wands?) 

Things to get on your weapons and shields (notice it is the same as your gear boosts?) Also note it does not matter what the weapon is as you never auto attack with this build only prismatic bolt. 

+Cast speed (Super Important) 


+Charge Rate (Super Important) 


+Elemental damage % (Super Important)


+Critical chance/damage % (Does not work well with the prismatic bolt due to the hidden crit chance adjustment)



Since Prismatic Bolt is not a DPS/Weapon DPS skill nothing really procs off it so focusing on these  first 3 just above is how you improve your damage output. 

Earlier I mentioned that I am not saying wands when I mention weapons. This is because I am currently using a unique pistol that gives me +20% Charge and Cast Rate! (The 2 important boosts for this build). So don't worry that your mage is not using a wand or staff because its the effects that matter on this build not the weapon.  Having said that you may find two wands that are +cast rate/charge rate which is fantastic! Go for it! 

I am changing my gem suggestions from the original post and inserting what was said by **tetracycloide**

""Crit and crit damage aren't very good for prismatic bolts as the skill simply doesn't scale very well with either of those stats. Every skill has a hidden crit chance adjustment and for prismatic bolts it's a measly 8% (most skills based on weapon DPS with a single projectile are 100% by comparison). On top of that each elemental component crits independently so while you may see 'critical' pop up frequently what's actually happening is one or more pieces of a given bolt are critically hitting which isn't much additional damage. You'll always be better off with full focus then a mix of dex/str/focus for prismatic builds when it comes to damage.



**Spells**

This changes as you get higher in level so I will say the higher level spells I am using now. I say this because once you get so much bloody focus you do not need spells like arcane tools and concentration. They become useless. 

Must have spell is DERVISH (+ 30% cast speed

I use elemental Overload (+30% to fire, lightning, Prismatic uses all four of those elements so guess what folks?) 

Now the last two can be a matter of preference. I am using Adventuring and Barter myself. I know some people will say elemental protection but elemental boon really does a nice job of that. Also there is no need for Concentration because with a high focus and such a quick charge rate mana becomes a non issue. 


**Pets**

 I try to limit my pets to one summoning spell, and Elemental Overload or protection.  



**Taskbar/Skillbar/Right side skills**


Slots

1) Deaths Bounty 


2) Dervish


3) Elemental Boon 


4) Elemental Overload


5) Astral Ally 


6) Frost Phase


Right side/Main skills (2) Prismatic Bolt (duh?) and Hailstorm. 

**Summary**
It kicks ass. 

I hardly even have to use my buffs like boon

Unfortunately the heart in its current state isn't powerful enough.  But, and thus curing the *world* of ember blight!  He's so thoughtful!

But, and that could have disastrous effects of the element they ""guard"".  So he figures he'll just take a few samples, from each of the guardians.  A little here, a little there.  See, he's being nice again, not wanting to kill any nice innocent guardians and rob the world of, say, or anything else.  So that's what he's up to

Unfortunately, as mr. alchemist is traipsing across the land, the heart he's carrying is causing this sickness that makes anyone else attuned to magic susceptible to this possession too.  So, alchemist's plan isn't working out so well so far, or at least, not so well for the rest of us.

Here are the relevant differences that I've seen

**1. Pacing ----** 

D3 has this slow, the load times are much, much faster. T2 has a much quicker pacing, with smaller spaces between engagements, enormous maps with lots of sub-areas and a quick move speed. Elite fights involve a lot of running around, kiting, set-up activation, a much faster-paced exploratory focus. (The key system only underscores this and I love it.)

**2. Art style ----** 

D3 has a very tight and consistent, and it gets sort of visually boring quicker. T2 has a cartoony, simplistic art style that is often at odds with themes (big-headed cartoony brigands splattering blood everywhere seems visually clashy). However, the simplistic design means LOTS of character animations and LOTS of different enemies and NPCs with wide variations in appearance and color. The areas are huge and intricate (though not so much detailed) with a variety of themes in locations.

**3. Environment ----** 

As I mentioned before, then move on"". 

T2 has *huge* environments that are randomized at seemingly every level, orientation, and all sorts of other reasons to explore. The set pieces are awesome; enemies come crawling out of specialized nooks and crannies and from a variety of directions, the little mini-fights for treasure (the spawning waves around sarcophagi or obelisks), etc. My favorite moment in the beta was in the second undead catacombs, I had been fighting undead waves for about 30 minutes. I noticed a ton of skeletons lying around basically as ornamentation; some would come alive and stand up, but most were just set pieces. Then I saw a big skeleton impaled on a wall. I walked past thinking it was just more level flair, leap down from the pillar and come at me. This was *just a regular mob*

**4. Game design and metagame ----**

I'll be honest, but the basics of the system had been created in D1 and D2 and largely perfected in the latter. D3 represents innovations that I liked, and honestly it reminded me a lot of Dawn of War II's Last Stand mode, with 'wargear' acting as skills and runes. I think that faster-paced leveling up and insta-respec'ing represents much more user-friendliness and playability over restrictive and punishing skill point no-respec systems like TL and TL2. 

That said, are either nonexistant (the first ramp up is not a bit harder really) or punishingly brutal (soloing Inferno as a casual is unheard of), and I greatly dislike gear-grinds like D2 or Dungeon Defenders becomes at the higher levels. The addition of a real money auction house makes me more nervous, not less, because it ups the stakes and makes exploitation and game-breaking more profitable. D3 was the first game I've ever gotten an authenticator for for this reason. TL2 simply doesn't have that concern, and for someone who plays games relatively casually, this is ideal. Plus, and B. indie developers

**5. Conclusions ----**

I will play D3 through to its logical conclusion, in which case I will enthusiastically pick it back up for a while. But TL2, much like Torchlight, I will continue to play and pick up and tool around in for years as new mods and updates come out, and the addition of being able to play online or with friends makes that all the better.

After hitting level 100 on my first character I'm a bit tired of the vanilla acts and map works just feel very empty. That's why I thought I'd give Synergies a shot. However

1) How do I access all synergies features? I noticed changed spawns in the vanilla regions

2) Do I need to grind through vanilla story mode till ng4+ again to be able to access the jolly goodness of high level Synergies content?

3) Is it maybe possible to just quickly grind through this leveling dungeon that's supposed to be included to level up to 100 without giving a f**** bout the story?

4) Can I maybe port my freshly grown up level 100 ""mad genius"" outlander to Synergies without getting my ass handed to myself immediately?

5) When ""raid dungeons"" are mentioned on the synergies web page


Thanks for all the help

Back in torchlight 1 (played it 2 years ago on the xbox) i think there was a mine/dungeon where you could go as deep as you wanted until you cant progress because of your gear.

Can i find this in TL2 as well? I bought the game earlier today and i'm stuck on the ""find commander vale"" quest in some temple. Recommended level is 10-12 i think but im only level 7 and its getting waay too hard. Am i supposed to be underleveled here?

My buddy and I are playing through on elite as engineer and embermage and while we have had plenty of orange drops almost everything we have gotten has been outlander or berserker specific gear or gear that we just can't use (extremely high focus engineer gear or 80+vitality embermage gear). 

We got to a point due to total lack of drops that we had to resort to using rapid respec to increasing gold to use the gambling vendor to gear our characters. This was a slipperly slope and has kinda ruined the game experience for use for right now because well

We would be happy to grind for some gear but it is so frustrating to get nothing but +25% minion health and gear that is specific to a class that neither of us are playing.

1364185777.0,1ayfyf,Akimbo Shooty Outlander in Veteran.  What am I doing wrong?,Xen0nex,18,4,16,"**UPDATE:**  
**So after incorporating a mixture of you guys' advice for [changing skills](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill-calc?i=4#f9FnRSsZx_r4ereH4v5wXqAzyqXQdGIvVedq603xT1d7f) and [improving gear](http://i.imgur.com/tJ1JPMd.jpg), I've got about 10% more Health, 30% more armor, and the 20% debuff from Cursed Daggers to keep me alive.  Even got [my first ever Legendary](http://torchlight.wikia.com/wiki/Mutant_Action) off the Three Sisters!  Thanks for the tips so far!**

I've been having a lot of fun with my Outlander in Veteran, and wanted to check if anyone had any suggestions / criticisms for what I could change in terms of gear / playstyle, or what I should have done differently for stats / skills.

* So, I know I've already kinda shot myself in the foot by using a Str-based Shooty Outlander, but I feel like I should still be able to get better results than what I'm doing now :P)  I'm not planning to add more Dex, and mainly prioritized it early in order to use some nice Pistols + armor my Engineer had found earlier.  My Aggressive pet Falcon has **2 Summon Skeleton, a Summon Nether Imp, and a Frost spell**, and is also sometimes a **Spider.**

**EDIT:**  Here are some screenshots showing [**Weapons/Arcane Stats**](http://i.imgur.com/obL4xpt.jpg) as well as [**Attributes**](http://i.imgur.com/CrBY7Qk.png).

* Gear-wise, and according to my Arcane Statistics page I get around ~**700 DPS** and ~**1000 DPS** from my mainhand and offhand gun, respectively, with a 55% Execute chance.  (My Mainhand does less DPS because it has Conveys 155 Fire / 895 Ice Damage over 5 / 8 sec Enchantments, and I figure those end up dealing more damage.  In fact, a single shot to the dummy applies 250~400 Fire Damage over 5 sec and ~900 Ice Damage over 8 sec, which confuses me...)

* As far as tactics, I typically open by hitting them with **Blade Pact**, putting up some **Brambles**, then laying out some Venomous Hail and picking off stragglers with auto-attacks.  For tougher foes, I'll attempt ensnaring them with **Tangling Shot** while I stand in a **Stone Pact**, then alternate between lowering their armor with **Rapidfire**, blasting with **Venomous Hail**

Now, this method serves me quite well.  Starting in Act 3, however, **Bosses** have been proving much more difficult.  I died at least *half a dozen times* taking out Vyrax last night, and other recent Bosses have been similarly difficult.

I know I'm probably not doing as much damage as I could, or there's some technique for fighting Bosses that I'm missing.  The problem is all my normal methods, like Blade pact, Brambles, Stone Pact, Tangling Shot etc. just have no effect on Bosses since they are either immune, move around way too fast for Pacts to be useful, even without taking into account any minions they summon

So, or have I just been using it wrong?  I know I could just make a cookie-cutter Glaivelander and blast through everything, but I really want to use an **executing dual pistols character for style reasons**.  I'm not averse to changing up a few skills or using Respec potions if it's necessary, so is there something with either my stats, skills, gear, or tactics that I could change and get a similar build to have a chance at killing bosses without dying?

* ~~For the past few days
~~""**Unable To Connect To Authentication Server**""~~  
~~error.  (Not using any mods or anything, or is it just people in Japan, or just me?~~  
**FIXED.  I had a sneaky instance of peerblock running secretly despite closing the program; had to track it down in Task Manager...  My bad :P**

* For life/mana steal,"" to me that implies it is actually taking something away from the enemy.  Does this mean, that when I add a +100 lifesteal ember to a weapon, that my attacks now cause 100 more damage?  If so, I assume this damage is neither affected by armor nor boosted by any of my stats/passives/etc.?  
The differences between ""+X lifesteal"" and ""+X% lifesteal"" then become a little blurry, without adding any damage.  At least, I *think* so?  
Similarly, or do enemies essentially have infinite mana?

**EDIT:  Bonus question!**

* Is there anyway to get the bonuses from fish without your pet visibly transforming? Perhaps a mod?  
I like how cool the different starting pets look
