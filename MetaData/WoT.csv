1362500146.0,19pnn2,I have a theory about Slayer and Padan Fain (Amol Spoilers),Dirkinator,168,16,46,"Dont read this if you haven't read the last book!

Ok I have been thinking almost non stop about this awesome series since I finished AMOL. One aspect that I loved was the duality, reborn as endlessly as Rand is, to face him again and again. I felt so dumb for not realising this before AMOL.

Anyway here's my new theory. In the early books Moiraine or someone comments on how unusual it was for there to be three Taveren. Mat and Perrin are kind of wild cards

So what makes Fain and Slayer 'wild cards'? Well Fain is an anomaly even to the Dark One

Slayer to me was also an anomaly. A non source user with natural ability inside a forgotten world of dreams

The pattern, but what did Padan Fain represent? He may have performed evil acts, but his first person narratives made him seem more like he was insane, madness incarnate. Unpredictable. In short I think he represented chaos, outside of simple evil motivations like greed or power. So chaos, or random destruction is a hard concept to have an opposite to, some might say 'order' but I think it could be random Luck

I remember thinking it was anticlimactic the way Mat killed Fain, it was LUCKY that mat killed him or fain may have killed Rand. Mat and Fain were actually both linked by the Dagger in a very deep way.

So Perrin is a different story. For his duality with slayer I would simply suggest looking at it as hunter and prey. The slayer of wolves hunting the ultimate prey, struggling to remain human, fighting to both protect his friends and loved ones but also fighting to protect the wolves. It's like he's two people. Slayer is psychotically stuck in two worlds as 'Lord Luc' and Slayer, preferring to be Slayer, not really wanting to be Luc (that's how I took his section of AMOL anyway).

I highly recommend rereading the portion.

Basically

**“You deliver a message to Demandred from me. Tell him I know what he is up to.” Events to the south had Demandred’s mark all over them. Demandred had always liked using proxies.**

How does Graendal respond?

By talking about the Shara and how it controls its channelers. All the while watching how he might react.

So

**1) Why the decision to leave out the glossary at the end?**  

*Harriet suggested this. She liked the idea of RJ’s words being the last ones in the series

 

**2) What did the other letters Verin sent say?**  

*This is one of those I’d rather not answer

**3) Why didn’t Rand immediately find Matt and put him in charge of the armies?**  

*Rand knew where Mat was (the visions.) Therefore, he was doing just that. (To an extent.) Also, he understands that with Mat—unlike Perrin—swooping in and ordering him about is a good way to get Mat going the opposite direction. However, Mat also finds his way to where he needs to be. So, Rand decided to let the Pattern work on Mat, and instead focused on preparing Perrin*  

**4) If you had to think into the future of Randland

*Well, eventually. (I don’t know how that would have worked with Perrin’s new obligations.) From here, I stray away from cannon (meaning what RJ wanted) and into my own imaginings. I imagine that Rand went to see the world, becoming like Jain Farstrider. Min joined him, and they saw the world. Avi and Elayne spent decades, maybe centuries, leading their own people before retiring to join the other two.*

Organizationally, separating it into five acts gives good starting and ending points for each ""trilogy"" while also making it easier to see how the long arcs of the series develop over time. I think it also helps to justify the slowness of books 9-11; they constitute the falling action of the series after the ""climax"" of books 6-8 (which ends, after all, with major setbacks or new challenges for every character), with the characters beginning to solve their problems in preparation for the finale.

For all intents and purposes, in crafting a story that takes place in a world of endlessly repeating patterns, almost invites us to imagine the WoT as an ur-fantasy, the world in which all other fantasy narratives take place. In other words, the WoT can be read as the platonic ideal of the monomyth, to a certain extent.

It also manages to be an interesting social document. Love it or hate it, and what makes it work best is that Jordan never really spells that out for the reader. Other social issues get explored over the course of the series (especially ideas about duty, leadership, cross-cultural understanding, slavery, power, etc.)

Of course, most have a few plot arcs they could do without. Furthermore, while fans rarely discuss the literary merit of Jordan's work, he served as more of a master craftsman than a poetic genius. His prose is perfectly serviceable, but it's never the reason to be reading, and only rarely rises to the level of artistry we expect from ""serious literature,"" whatever that label means. Perhaps most importantly, mostly because of the sheer number of plotlines requiring advancement. 

Finally, Sanderson did a better job than many other authors who have taken over a series, with Brian Herbert being the most infamous failure. Ultimately, I feel that Sanderson proved to be a skilled understudy in a difficult role, that his skills as a writer improved markedly from TGS to AMoL, and that he hewed as closely to Jordan's vision for the series as any author could. One must also credit Harriet, who likely wielded more influence than many readers suspect; without her

In his internal dialogue, he mentions that Fain tried to control this mist, but wasn't ""mature"" enough to do so at that time.  Apparently Fain was the larval form of something, and Shaisalam is a more adult version of whatever he's becoming (notice the similarities between ""Shaisalam"" and ""Shaitan"").  The theory is that the Pattern begun spinning out a new Dark One once it knew that Rand MIGHT kill the already existing Dark One.  

So, silver Dark One.  Considering what did happen, the Pattern didn't need Fain anymore, so he was given a shitty and anti-climactic death at the hands of Mat.

Rand's story in particular is one of the best I have ever come across in any medium. Jordan had me completely fooled with him: everything Rand did felt entirely justified. Even when you can see him starting to turn evil in the later books

This series is not perfect. Far from it. One only has to look at book 10 to realise this. The first six books were amazing (especially Dumai's Wells - the last time I was this stunned by a book was the scene that must not be named from ASoIaF, they really did drag. The level of detail, whilst absolutely incredible, was rather unnecessary a lot of the time. Book 10 in particular deserves some kind of award: 800 pages in which literally nothing happens is quite an achievement.

Thankfully, and braid-tugging, we finally got back to the plot. Many of the scenes in Sanderson's books are amongst the best in the series. Egwene, who had had very little to do for the last few books depsite being made Amrylin, suddenly became awesome. Her fight in the White Tower was incredible. The darkness that had been slowly growing in Rand finally came to a head. The scene on the Dragonmount rivals Dumai's Wells for me - even though I knew that he wouldn't do it, I was virtually holding my breath reading the final paragraphs of that scene. Perrin finally embracing his inner wolf. Forging his hammer and dismissing balefire pretty much made up for about 6 books worth of sulking from him. And while Sanderon's Mat got off to a shaky start, he felt like Mat again in book 13.

I don't know if I'd rate this as the best fantasy series of all time. For all its strengths, I think it is one of the only series that truly deserves the title of epic.",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,Dragon,

First off, if not before. We are also given ample evidence of souls being migrated from one body to another, especially as a method to avoid death. Therefore, I think it's pretty well foreshadowed, definitely moreso than the other popular pre-AMoL theory that Nynaeve would ""cure death."" And certainly more foreshadowed than the third theory, that Rand would die permanently, because Jordan did all but hit us over the head with the fact that Rand would find some way to survive.

I think it's possible to at least begin coming up with a mechanical theory for how the body swap occurred by examining the balefire incident in ACoS. When the two balefire beams crossed in SL, the Pattern has a Blue-Screen-of-Death moment, unable to resolve the causality cascade (Moridin's weave erased Rand's weave erased Moridin's weave erased...), and the two threads become increasingly indistinguishable. Unfortunately for Rand, this causes him to be able to access the TP without even the scant protection provided by the Dark One, further tainting his channeling ability. It also creates an ambiguity in the Pattern that causes the pain experienced by one body to be felt by the other.

Because the two characters have been conflated by the Pattern into one entity, only brings them further closer. In the aftermath of the battle, Rand has ruined his body through burning out, but Moridin is protected due to the properties of circles; he's exhausted, but likely couldn't have been killed. Rand and Moridin, both on the edge of death, collapse outside the cavern, hovering near death

This is all speculation, which made swapping bodies possible. Any other explanation renders the entire weird linking subplot superfluous to the story. 

But what do you think? Is there some other way the body swap could've happened? ",self,t5_2rdg1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/17kp6r/epilogue_mechanics_question_amol_spoilers/

Huge fan of WOT, throughout the whole series I failed to understand the significance of Ishamael (later Moridin). There are probably a lot of subtle aspects of The Wheel Of Time that my feeble brain never picked up on, but yesterday I was at Soundwave Festival (massive music festival in Australia) when I was drunk and a bit stoned I was discussing AMOL with a friend when he said ""what was going on with Moridin and the ending?"" or something like that. It clicked:

The creator has the dragon. Rand was worried about going mad, he was right. If you think of the dragon as the champion of light, tasked with saving reality from the dark, an (arguably) Christ like figure, then the Naeblis is the Champion of the Dark, charged with bringing about the end of everything, an anti Christ.

Maybe that has seemed obvious to some of you? It hit me like a ton of bricks: this character that I never really understood the significance of over the last fifteen years of reading this series

The duality all fits: Rand is guided by prophecy and a sense of self sacrifice to become the Dragon, the only escape for him will be the oblivion of The Dark One winning. They both are able to remember their past lives. They both have powerful allies, but whereas Rand has fellow Taveren and powerful heroes like Egwene and Nynaeve, plus all the countless characters that make up the forces of Light, people who genuinely love him and want to help him, Moridin has the forsaken, scheming underlings who want nothing more than to take him down, plus countless darkfriends as fodder for the forces of Darkness.

1363764590.0,1anguz,Nakomi was Tigraine,BieberBot,80,18,70,"Just my own speculation

We know two things about Nakomi.

One, this is enough to rule out the apparently favored 'avatar of the creator' theory.  Even if the creator is taking a hand in events, he isn't Aiel, so why would he do that?  It also points strongly to Tigraine, who adopted the Aiel culture, and is the grandmother of Aviendha's future kids.  Nokomis is an Iroquois word meaning grandmother, and also specifically refers to the grandmother of Hiawatha, but strong.

Two, his adopted father and several adopted mothers (Moiraine, Nynaeve, every Maiden of the Spear), [it was](/s ""Nakomi who was there to comfort Rand as he lay dying on the slopes of Shayol Ghul."")  Everything in WoT has that all-encompassing feeling, the idea that all our myths and religions spring from this.  If thats the feeling you're going for, who do you put at the feet of the messiah as [he](/s ""lays dying?"")  Obvious answer: his mother.  Even having been absent for the entire story

Now, perhaps divine magical powers), Tigraine, in return for giving up her position in Andor in favor of a position as a female soldier who lives in the desert, got a second life.  This fits nicely with Nakomi appearing to approve of Rand hauling Moridin's corpse out of the Pit of Doom.  She knows what he has to do to perform a body swap because she's been through something similar.  It also fits nicely with the irregularities in the Aviendha scene that made some people think it happened in T'A'R, her fire barely consumed the logs just like Rand's pipe burned without being lit.  And just as Rand's story is now over and he'll be staying out of the affairs of the world, Tigraine had played her role.  She might have been living in seclusion in the waste for the entirety of Rand's life."")

I know Sanderson and everybody else is clamming up on this one.  I'm hoping I'm right, this is the one who was there with Rand at his (temporary) death, so the idea that we can all just deal with not knowing who she is, is bogus.",,False,self,1363790158.0,t3_1anguz

But the First Oath is where we can really have some fun. The first alternative interpretation is obvious: ""I shall *speak* no word that is not true, but nothing would stop her from speaking untrue *sentences* - if someone asked her ""Are you a Forsaken?"" she could not say ""No,"" but she could say, ""I am not a Forsaken"" - there isn't a single untrue word in that sentence, even though they add up to a lie.

I started this morning the first WoT book. I consider myself a new fantasy reader, and soon after Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, I never really got into fantasy literature until last year, when I read the first chapters of Game of Thrones. I got crazy for fantasy, crazy, crazy, I needed other worlds, I needed magic!
After a whole year dedicated to fantasy literature reading (Lord of the Rings, Belgariad, Mistborn, Narnia) I've finally decided to start the Wheel of Time. Now you must be asking: Why didn't you read it before? Well I wanted to get used to the genre, get my own opinions and tastes around it before reading the biggest epic fantasy there is out there (everyone talks about it!!). But the day finally came, and today I started reading the first chapters of the Eye of the World.
Often I find myself wishing I could go back in time and re-read my favorite books without knowing what is coming next, I still did not find Two Rivers there, but I will! haha), and really got excited about that, I guess that means war? 
But most importantly
I'm about to start the fourth chapter, but never forget the first pages you read and how you fell in love with it. I know I will miss these pages a year from now, probably laughing at my guesses, but that's what makes epic fantasies the most wonderful thing in the world.

In March 2006 I learned that the creator of the series had been diagnosed with a rare condition that gave him a life expectancy of about 4 years.  I was crushed, and although he had initially been given 4 years to live, he passed a little more than a year and a half after being diagnosed.  

Was it over? No
It was a wonderful book.  It gave me confidence that the series was in absolutely the right hands.  The Final Book of The Wheel of Time, was released January 2013.  
I intentionally read it as slowly as I could to keep the end from coming, and now there is no next book.

Please remember that not everyone wishes to read anything about or from A Memory of Light until its release in January. To keep things peachy around here

Another reminder, such as ""The Seanchan and Kaf (TSR spoilers)"", we open the discussion to more individuals who know they can enter the discussion without fear of spoiling books they haven't read. 

One more important point for you all: ***Please remember to place book specific titles on spoilers that go outside of the book being discussed in the thread.*** 

For example, the book being discussed. 

This is key to preventing accidental spoilage of huge plot points (the above is a very small and unimportant spoiler) to those who thought that the only topics that would be brought up in the discussion would pertain to the book being discussed.

First off, so far that is. Here is the orginal thread that started me off in this journey, http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1fm1me/no_spoilers_i_just_finished_a_dance_with_dragons/

I just wanted to share with you guys some of my highlights from the first 3 books:

1) I laugh every ime one of the guys says about the others. ""I wish _blank_ was here

2) One of my favorite scenes was the first time Rand tried to use the Portal Stone on purpose, I loved the one where the people from Two Rivers were fighting, almost laughing, saying ""I feel like I've done this before"", or something to that extent.

3) On that note, like its in their DNA.

4) I'm really into things like /r/Psychonaut/, Duality, Multiverse, Choice vs Destiny, and just thinking of what it means to exist in general. This book touches on almost all of those types of things. To me, I feel as if the True Source is like a drug for these women, and being stilled must be like one of the worst withdraws ever faced. The idea of the Dark One existing as a Paradox is pretty cool. As long as he is trapped in one, he is trapped in all of him, which actually gives us the choice of free will

5) Mat Cauthon is slowly becoming my favorite character. I love gambling, like in Book 1 when he nailed that monster in the Waste right in the eye, but I didn't realize it was going to get this crazy. That scene when in Tar Valon where he fights the prince, and his half-brother with his staff, I had no clue he was that much of a bad ass. He quite a funny little shit too. 

6) The outpacing of events for Moraine: I like how its kind of knocked her down a notch in my head

7) I really seems like books 2 and 3 have followed a particular pattern. Everyone starts off kind of together, where they all find themselves in an absolute shitstorm. To me, its like continuous big bangs happening over and over again. ( there is a theory on time/universe that kind follows this thought, you guys might enjoy this, but be warned, it gets really heady. [

These little big bangs at the end of each book are like a fractal smaller big bang that is going to happen at the end of the series, and the Dark One.

In HP a word is tied to the spell. Speak the word and you get the spell. You have to know the name of the spell and you have to know the hand movement. (Swish and Flick for ""Wingardium Leviosa"" - levitation). In WoT

So how do the two relate

HP requires a wand and WoT does not. Its obvious that the wand must a very powerful ter'angreal. What's not clear is how it works. I however

In the 4th age, however, she realized that she could make an extremely weak angreal that didn't increase the users power, but did have a buffer that wouldn't let you overdo yourself. Since they did not require extra power from the Aes Sedai that created it, these could be mass produced and the first precurser to the HP wands were born.

Great

This same brown is still studying. Her weak angreals have decreased burn outs, it stores the actual weave. Drawing all 5 elements into the modified well, it would be able to take what it needed from her and output the preformatted weave. Think of it like a computer function. You input the power and it returns the weave. This came with significant drawbacks, however. She wanted a multipurpose tool. What good is it if you have to use a different ter'angreal for each weave?

Tired, still upset that the Dragon's Peace meant that they had to deal with these people. These people who enslaved channelers, forcing them to perform weaves--- Weaves that they themselves can't see and don't know!!! Thrilled, and slightly disturbed that a'dams just thrilled her, she runs back to her quarters. A'dams! A'dams force the wearer to perform the weave. With that she completed her work. Instead of linking 2 people, this a'dam connects the Aes Sedai to the well. The compulsion aspect of the a'dam enables her to create identifiers for each specific weave that was loaded into the ter'angreal. This meant that no one had to learn the actual weaves anymore. Simply holding the wand and giving it the command produced the same result.

And that

This was clarified further in Winter's Heart

From TPD when Elayne ""experiments"" with the rod (of pleasure):
&gt;And then there was the crimson rod that felt hot. Hot
   Sitting on the edge of her bed at an inn called The Wild Boar, but felt firm rather than hard. She was alone; since the helmet, she had tried to do her studying away from the others. The heat of the rod made her think of Fire...  
   Blinking, fully dressed, stood frowning down at her. Aviendha and Birgitte were watching from beside the door.  
   ""What happened?"" Elayne demanded
   ""You don’t want to know."" Her lips twitched.  
   Aviendha’s face gave away nothing. Birgitte’s mouth might have been a little tight
   The worst of it was, by the quickly hidden grins she saw, from Kinswomen and Windfinders as well as sisters. But no one would tell her! After that, she decided to leave studying the ter’angrealto somewhere more comfortable than a inn. Somewhere definitely more private!  

The only bit I could find as ""clarification"" in WH

&gt; Squeezing her eyes shut, and whimpered, ""Two months!"" Shaking free of them, she straightened and fixed Aviendha with blue eyes clear as water and hard as ice. ""Shield her for me, and I'll let you off your share."" Aviendha's sullen, indignant glare just slid off her.",,nsfw,Fang,

1. Are there any female characters who aren't stubborn, Egwene and Nynaeve seem to all have the exact same character.

2. Are there any anti-heroes? I don't need the total gray area assholes that seem to be 100% of the characters in ASOIAF

PS, ""I never understood why a grown-ass man gotta talk like that. He mean's 'fuck me', whether he knows it or not.""

We've seen in Rand's POVs, Rand has become very good at Daes Dae'mar. He is also perhaps more familiar with the Prophecies of the Dragon than any other character.

 He can give up the decision on when to Egwene

Later in the books (I'd have to dig to find it, and could be regarded as a kind of vision contained within his madness, but I think his fervor and worship of Rand could be a sign of a kind of Compulsion.  The rest of the Dragonsworn seem to share this fervor, and eagerness to follow the Dragon.  With the Dragonsworn spread all across Randland by the end of the books (Masema and many of his followers are killed by Aiel/Faile, but the Dragonsworn are still spread out all over the place), it seems to me that those could be the ""armies"" that Demandred refers to.  It would also explain why he would need Moghedien to take charge of one, as they would be spread out, as Demandred's strategy seems to involve turning those sworn to the Dragon

My theory is that Demandred is not someone else, and sowing madness and zeal throughout their ranks.  When it is time for them to join the Last Battle, Demandred will pose as Rand and bring the Asha'man with Taim to bring them under his banner, claiming that he is the true Dragon, and they must bring down the pretender, Rand.

With Sanderson's two books so fresh in mind I've come to realize what I I dislike about the middle part of the series.  And it's that at this point Perrin gets involved in little subplots without ever meeting major characters until the final trilogy.  He becomes terribly *stagnate.*

A brief summary of what happens to Perrin from Path of Daggers until you start The Gathering Storm.

1. Perrin loses Faile and Morgase and Perrin gets them back.

3. Perrin continues to brood over his forced leadership with no resolution.

4. Perrin cotinues to brood over his axe vs. hammer with no resolution.


What he has/is during the middle of Path of Daggers is pretty much what he is had/is after the prologue of Gathering Storm except: Aram's dead. Masema's dead. Shaido sub story is resolved. And some Seanchan trust/respect  Perrin.

Now

I think Perrin chapters after Path of Daggers up until Gathering Storm might be worth skipping on future read throughs.

He also mentioned that the sequels only had one sentence each for a description. He didn't say what they were out loud as it could spoil AMOL for people. 

I asked him what they were as I was getting my books signed and this is what he said:

The first is ""Perrin is going to Shara to kill an old friend"" 

And the second is:

""Matt lying in a gutter wearing a tattered cloak""

I'm thinking the perrin one could be him going to kill Rand or Gaul. Could also be long tooth. I it could also be ""old friend"" in a sarcastic way and could be some form of slayer returned. 

The matt one is could him having issues with the rebels back in seanchan? That ones very vague.

(Spoilers All),bored_man_child,47,6,27,"With the series finally over,  10 thousand.. pages to read.  The epilogue seemed a little too short.  So I decided to compile a list of fun scenes of my own that I would have loved to read with the flair of sanderson's/jordan's voice.

1.  Perrin going toe to toe with the wise ones in the World of Dreams.  I loved the story arc for Perrin (even though the middle area got a little dreary).  By the end of the Last Battle he has become, it would be nice to see him as the master in his element.  The scene with him flitting between worlds with each heartbeat, pursuing slayer relentlessly was nothing short of AWESOME.  I wanted more.

2.  Mat and Rand gambling together in a tavern somewhere.  Mat with his luck

3. Not particularly a scene

4.  Going off on a tangent here because my mind is still reeling from just finishing the series, and were corrupted beyond measure, but I still held out hope that one of them would finally rebuke the Dark One (Lanfear kinda did, but she didn't come any closer to the Light by doing so).  Moridin seemed close to it, or Lanfear maybe.  I do like how the Lanfear arc ended though.  It was very fitting.  She seems to be making strides toward the light, but really it was all a ploy for power and revenge on Lews Therin.

This won’t include any of the released aMoL material.

The world is in trouble. The Dark One’s touch has everything rotting and decaying, it can be presumed that the rest of the Borderlands are being overrun.

Rand is gathering his armies at the Field of Merillor, as Amyrlin of the reunited, Black Ajah-purged Aes Sedai, is gathering rulers and armies in opposition to this. Elayne, with her forces, stands with Egwene, and Perrin with his forces (including Galad and the Whitecloaks) are standing with Rand.

Rand has found peace again. Lews Therin Telamon is no longer a voice in his head, having destroyed it at the end of tGS. His very presence seems able to counter the Dark One’s touch on the world; plants will literally start sprouting in his presence. When last we saw him, he saw Cyndane/Lanfear in his dreams, pleading with Rand to help her.

Perrin has gotten himself together, so we can assume that everyone does. He’s got a really cool hammer.

Mat, though it cost Mat an eye. Noal, a.k.a. Jain Farstrider, sacrificed himself so they could escape. Moiraine and Thom professed their love for one another, to Mat’s shock.

Lan has reached Tarwin’s Gap,000 was charging at the approximately 100,000 Trollocs camped in the Gap.

The Band of the Red Hand is at Caemlyn, which warned him that Trollocs were about to invade Caemlyn via the presumed-secure Waygate. Talmanes reads the letter, and rushes outside to see Caemlyn (where Aludra’s Dragons are stored) burning.

Mazrim Taim is firmly in control of the Black Tower, which is loyal to Rand, is dwindling; the Asha’man in it, and their allied Aes Sedai, are switching sides at an alarming rate. Presumably, Taim is turning them using the trick of 13 Dreadlords channeling through 13 Myrddraal. Those who are there are unable to escape, as Gateways will not open in the Black Tower. Most likely there is a Dreamspike in tel’aran’rhiod preventing them.

Aviendha, being reduced to pitiful wretches scavenging for food in garbage piles. She is determined to do something to prevent this, but it is not clear what.

The Seanchan are firmly in control of Altara, though Seanchan itself is in chaos after Semirhage slaughtered the Imperial family. The Seanchan now have Travelling, as Elaida was captured during their raid on the Tower.

Gawyn is now Egwene’s warder

And finally

Moridin

Demandred: Alive and well

Moghedien: Alive and working directly for Moridin.

Cyndane

It's a well-established fact that while the DO touches the world directly and often

However, The Dark One, and The Wheel of Time. I include the Wheel because of the commonly used phrase ""the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,"" which seems to give the Wheel its own agenda. 

But why would there even be a third entity at all

My theory is that there is no Wheel, it began to eclipse the image of the Creator as the 'mover and shaker' of the universe. Eventually, the Creator ended up being viewed as nothing more than the source of the One Power, but completley uninterested in helping us along.

If this is true, the Heroes of the Horn, etc. are actually the ways the Creator has tried to help mankind and counter the DO's actions. 

Evidence seems to abound

* All the lost Talents reappearing
* Stronger and stronger channelers coming out of the woodwork to support the Light.
* IIRC
* Ta'veren seem to be the Creators ace-in-the-hole to counter anything the DO can throw at them

RE: a) 

&gt; And yet, you can know you're reading Robert Jordan's words, though of course there are other scenes scattered through the book that he worked on too.

Taken straight from Sanderson's blog. That epilogue was all Jordan. Don't like it? Tough titties. It may not be the ending you wanted, no way to fill plot holes that were left open by merely having notes and not Jordan himself.

i'm not trying to say ""don't complain, or even on ""Team Jordan"", are not really their fault. You can't just fill in the missing pieces as an entirely different author without potentially changing something that the original author may have wanted. You can't possibly know.

RE: b)

&gt;Question: Any news on the Wheel of Time Encyclopedia?
&gt;
&gt;Answer: Harriet was asked about this at our signing, and it will include things from Robert Jordan's notes that didn't make it into the series. (Note that the Waygate Foundation, a charity organization, is running a charity drive tied to the Encyclopedia right now.)
&gt;
&gt;Question: What about the outriggers? (The sequel trilogy to the Wheel of Time series that Robert Jordan had planned to write.)
&gt;
&gt;Answer: It's not going to happen. Harriet and I are both firm on this. Robert Jordan wouldn't have wanted it to happen. He said that he wanted the series to be finished
&gt;
&gt;Beyond this, quite literally, only two sentences of explanation from RJ telling us what the plot of the outriggers was to be about.
&gt;
&gt;So no

It's more than a little disappointing to me. The only reason I can think of for a delay in e-release is a fear of piracy and/or someone leaking the book. It's an understandable fear, even though we use a digital device, still will not cheat an artist of his dues. And so, presumably, I am made to wait, just as all of the others like me (and I know a few of them) are being made to wait.

So what does this wait accomplish? For you, your still loyal, but just a little different fans? We get to wait, while our friends who aren't e-reader people enjoy the end of one of their favorite series. Oh sure, I could buy the hardback and have instant gratification, I know. But when you're like me, and you've purchased all the books in one format, doesn't it?

And so, nor visit dragonmount.com, or any of the other WoT sites that I've come to enjoy. And I'll do it so that the fans who buy your hardback, don't spoil it for **me**, the fan who dared not buy the hardbacks, just because he didn't want to drag a huge book back and forth to work to see it ruined in the lunch room. I'd say I'm the only ebook guy out there, but if that were true, nor would Barnes &amp; Noble sell so many Nooks. And I'm pretty sure Apple would have long since eliminated the iBookstore

I know that Sanderson sometimes pops up around here, like Moiraine would say. But I wouldn't have used that quote without that evil little e-reader, would I?

EDIT: Spelling.

EDIT (10/26/12): To all those out there suggesting piracy as a solution to my above whining; that's not a solution. Piracy is going to make matters like above worse, I just want the book when everyone else gets it. I'd say this with any authors work where it was the same situation. I realize that there's nothing I can do about it now, I just wish publishers would realize there's a HUGE market out there that they alienate with all this crap. I know Sanderson can't do anything about it, and I appreciate Harriet Rigney's angle, but if we let them know that there's a market out there, it may find it's way to the publishers.

Bottom line; Sanderson deserves a paycheck. Robert Jordan's work deserves NOT to be pirated because of the an idiot publishers paranoid decision.",self,t5_2rdg1,1351254047.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/11ucgp/dear_brandon_sanderson_harriet_rigney_thoughts/

Tuon is not stupid. She is in fact written as one of the shrewdest characters in Randland. She is also extremely superstitious. But never stupid. We see her as either being apparently naive to the fact that suldam can channel or stubbornly refusing to admit it. When she later admits it she still maintains a ridiculous argument that suldam choose not to be 'animals' or whatever. I think she has reasons for this:


She is raised as an empress, that what is done to these women is for the greater good. That it is what is right for them, that they are dangerous running free, that they want to be Damane.


I have stated elsewhere that the damane are the perfect parable for black slavery in America and the perpetrators of those cruelties. The justifications given by Seanchan and Slave Owners were similar in the way they dehumanise their victims:


""They want to be slaves

The economy will go to ruin if they are freed

Its better for them than running around causing trouble

They're not real people


I don't see Tuon easily turning her back on thousands of years of this kind of sick reasoning, and so will never change her official position on Damane.


So the attempted ending of compulsory Damane would be chaos as I see it (perhaps you could compare it to the American civil war? the final outcome has been good for society but the chaos and destruction it caused severely damaged America) Then there's her confrontation with Egwene


I doubt Egwene intended this as an option, and for the Seanchan positions of honour seem to be all they give a shit about anyway. Even Tuon is smart enough to see this a better alternative for her empire, which is why she shocked the crowd and agreed to such outrageous conditions with Egwene.


So in summation: I think Tuon secretly wants the deal with Egwene, possibly one day having the suldam learn to channel. What initially reads a clever win for Egwene can also be seen a very clever scheme of Tuons

""It is the morning after TDR, he gets dressed and goes out to the White Tower grounds. He still wants to say goodbye to Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne before he leaves. He asks till he finds a bridge guard and sure enough the man recognizes him. As he walks along he sees Else Grinwell and tries to talk to her. She avoids his touch, coolly asks what he is doing out of bed, and hurries on. Hearing the clacking of swords, he walks to the Warder training yard and watches the students practice. He recognizes Galad and Gawyn from Elayne's descriptions. They recognize him from Egwene's descriptions and talk with him during a break. Gawyn asks Mat about Rand. Their talk develops into a wager, Mat with a quarterstaff against both of them with their practice swords. Their trainer, watches closely. Mat thumps both of them but nearly faints from hunger during the fight. After the fight, to a farmer with a quarterstaff. Gawyn is impressed with Mat's skill, Tam

Also, and hurries on.""

1364738396.0,1bcvt7,A disorganized list of questions and thoughts about the entire series (spoilers all),depricatedzero,41,9,48,"Ok there's a bunch of small things that I mill over occasionally and want to put down. Some are just thoughts without a question

I welcome feedback on my thoughts

* Who was the Tinker at the Darkfriend Social?

* Who was Setalle Anan? Was she the one who tested the Dream Ter'angreal that wrote the notes Verin gave to Egwene?

* When did Ishamael/Moridin begin inducting Taim?

* Rand is almost Moiraine's nephew. Her brother Taringail Damodred was Tigraine's first husband

* Rand has a direct blood tie to Elayne through Tigraine. Haha...it's distant enough to not matter though.

* What the FUCK do the Dice in Mat's head represent!?!?! I can't figure this out! I mean

* Would Perrin have still married Faile if she had kept the name Mandarb? Probably...

* Theory: The reason that physically entering Tel'aran'rhiod is evil is because it dulls empathy. Those light-side characters who enter TAR in the flesh (Rand, Rand's hard-on to be cuendillar, and Perrin seemed to temporarily lose it after fighting Slayer in the flesh in AMOL. Each one was able to overcome this by the way Hopper taught Perrin to not exist too fully in the Dream. Perrin focused on Faile, of course. Rand snapped out of it (among much else) when he almost killed Tam. Egwene snapped out of it after bonding Gawyn. 

* Bella is a Hero of the Horn.

* Elayne's children are going to be Heroes of the Horn. Either one is Gaidal(though I think it more likely Grady's ugly ass kid is Gaidal)

* Min is barren. :(

* If Bayle Doman had followed through with his oath to dump the Domination Band into the ocean

* A lot of Ishamael's philosophical conjecture in the first few books turn out ironically prophetic in the end.

* What was going on on the Continent of Madness this whole time? I'm guessing that's where Perrin jumped to when fleeing Slayer.

* I forget who went

* Who else could Jain have been? All of the Heroes (and even the Forsaken) have names derived from famous characters. Graendel is properly transformed into the visage fitting the story of Grendel, Amerasu -&gt; Amaterasu, so on and so forth. For that matter, what about Birgitte and Gaidal Cain? Could Farstrider be Neil Armstrong? Noal -&gt; Neil isn't a big leap.

1367614841.0,1dn4q9,My thoughts on AMoL's Ending.[Spoilers],GenghisBob,37,8,20,"There are also Spoilers for The Mistborn Trilogy below.

When I typed this up I was having a conversation with /u/JagYui about our theories on what the significance of the pipe is and here is what I came up with and i'm fairly confident in it. In the conversation Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn Trilogy came up by JagYui and a comparison between the creator and the dark one.


The forces in the *Mistborn* Trilogy and WoT are very similar. However, wanted to make a source of life and that's what the wheel is. When the wheel was created Newton's third law took place and upon the creation of the life he inadvertently created destruction(The Dark One). 


Since the wheel is the power of creation/life and the dark one is the power of destruction/death this explains why The Dark One's touch on the pattern is strictly destruction(Which was obvious because he was always refereed to as a source of destruction and evil). 


When Rand was taken into The Dark One's plain (Is that the right way to describe it?) and they were both weaving the pattern to their will it would be safe to assume that this is very much like Vin in *MistBorn* when she embodies preservation. She was only capable of preserving while Rand was only capable of changing the sequence of lives by changing the flows of the one power flowing in the pattern. 


As he was controlling these flows of the power Rand reached a level of Nirvana that no other Aes Sedai has ever reached before because he** knew** that not only did the One Power turn the wheel but was the basis for which everything existed. This is observed when Rand goes to Rhuidan and witnesses the ogiers and channelers all Singing together to create  an Ogier Grove. Leading me to believe that in the Age of Legends there was an obvious greater understanding of the nature of the One Power and its interaction with the wheel, as in Tel'aran'rhiod, believe the pipe was lit and it would be.  


As I was proof reading this I thought of another point

Rand can set wards that can kill whoever enter it, he will set wards immediately, or take any other precautions he might need to, after all, flying was an age of legends thing, so only the forsaken would have access to it.

In mine Rand travels around the world with Min having adventures and impressing everybody by being very mysterious and knowing. He and Min grew up from very humble roots so I can see them being perfectly content not living in the lap of luxury. Of course they probably have some sort of system set up so that they can visit Elayne and Avhienda and Rand's kids. When Elayne and Avhienda turn 100 they retire and spend the rest of their lives traveling with Rand. Also in my vision Min gets to live for a very long time too because of her vision power (I know this is not intended by Jordan but it's my headcanon so who cares)

Mat travels back to Seanchan with Tuon and together they reconquer it in a very spectacular way. Tuon eventually agrees to phase out the damane after finally seeing some logic.

Perrin lives the quiet happy life with Faile he always wanted. He trains his kids as blacksmiths even though they don't need to be.

Lan and Nynaeve bring back Malkieri and rule it until Lan dies and Nynaeve decides to focus on being a healer and let their son/daughter rule.

1353896945.0,13sh0a,Wheel of Time Geographical Anomaly,LordNephets,40,11,54,"I'm in the process of typing up a very large theory which will be a later link

I have been theorizing for a long time about a few geographic issues I have had with the Wheel of Time series. I have been a fan of medieval fantasy and sword and sorcery for quite some time, i.e. what is the size of the land that the Wheel of Time takes place? This area, known as the ""Westlands"" by some, and by ""Randland"" by others, or by many other names, is defined for the remainder of this article as the land between the Spine of the World and the Aryth Ocean, and the land between the Mountains of Dhoom the Sea of Storms. I will refer to this area as the ""Westlands"" here out. When describing distances, I refer to the distance (in miles) from The Sea of Storms south of Illian to the base of the Mountains of Dhoom. When referring to ""Distance East/West"" (in miles), can not be taken as fact. I will also propose my own system of measurement for the size of the Westlands. 

The first text under my scrutiny is ""The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time"" which is often seen as accurate, the text is: ""considered broadly canonical and Robert Jordan provided substantial amounts of never-before-seen information for it"". However, it should be noted that: ""Jordan's intent was for the book to have been written by a historian of Rand al'Thor's time (albeit an extremely well-informed one) and he wished to ensure that the book would be prone to some of the problems of bias and guesswork that afflict 'real' history as well"". In this sense, anything that is not expressly stated within Jordan's novels themselves or expressly approved by Robert Jordan himself cannot be taken as fact. However, in the prequel New Spring which is written by Robert Jordan, measurements that are more direct and distinct are given concerning the Westlands. “A reliable way of measuring the maps was produced in the novel New Spring, which gave the straight-line distance from Tar Valon to the sea south of Tear as 400 leagues (1, 100 miles for Emond's Field to Baerlon,000 miles - for Kinslayer's Dagger to northern Amadicia).

These measurements, which is confirmed by TWoRJWoT. This measurement, which I will refer to from here on out as “Classic Dimension”, lists the height of the Westlands as approximately 2000 miles, and the distance North/South as approximately 3000 miles. Typically, I would be satisfied with such a measurement, but evidence suggests to me that these measurements are incorrect. These measurements have the Westlands physically around the size of the United States. This in itself is not disconcerting; however, along with an unidentifiably long stretch of Blight to the North, but does present itself as such when we look at the climate of the Wheel of Time. If we look at the Two Rivers, locations that far south were described as “never having seen snow” by Rand al’Thor and other characters. While this is not impossible (Areas in Europe or America see snow during the winter while locations only a thousand miles south may never see snow)

There are only two logical possibilities that could explain such a climactic phenomenon, is that the Westlands is located on a planet considerably larger than ours, while also having the correct atmosphere, rotation, tilt, and distance from its sun to have similar climate patterns as ours. The second and considerably more likely option and the one I will sustain for the rest of this document, and try to defend, other smaller, and Lord of Chaos.

Firstly, the rough size of the Westlands can be estimated as being 3500 miles East/West, and 2000 miles North/South, except in two measurements: The distance from Tear to Aringall, as put forth by New Spring, is 900 miles, which would mean that the Westlands East/West distance is a massive 4800 miles, and normally would be thrown out as simple error by the person providing the measurement. This is the exact thing my theory needs. If it is possible even within New Spring, it is the statement the distance from Emond’s Field to Baerlon is 100 miles. When worked out, but also because the distance from Emond’s Field to Baerlon is the smallest physical distance measured in New Spring

Matrim Cauthon states when moving his armies from camp to assault the Forsaken in Illian, and then calculate basic walking speed.

The normal walking speed of an adult human is 3.2 miles per hour, and only rests to allow 8 hours of sleep for the men (the biological need), and don’t worry about rests, et cetera, then we can find a simple calculation to see how fast he travels. 35 miles a day over 16 hours of travel means that Mat is moving 2.1 mph, a bit slower than walking speed. If Mat moves from sunup to sundown (12 hours), then Mat is moving 3 mph, which now provides the biggest argument. If Mat completes the trip from Maerone to Tear in only 30 days (though he says it will take more than a month), the distance is 1750 miles

So, which makes the Westlands simply impossible as far as climate is concerned, and would make the Aiel Waste and Shara, tacked onto the Westlands most likely the width of an entire planet.

The only logical explanation I can see for this is that a mile in the Wheel of Time is not equal to a mile in Earth. I recommend those reading this to find their own measurements and examples

""Into the heart, to hold the hearts of men (ie. their destiny/survival).

1370690085.0,1fx6fw,My theory about Tuon in AMOL version 2 (spoilers),Dirkinator,31,5,13,"I have very recently posted a theory about what Tuon was up to when she reached an agreement with Egwene to allow Seanchan ambassadors to recruit Aes Sedai and others to become Damane. It's a bizarre point in the story. She spent time with Aes Sedai

Well a few people have pointed out to me that my previous post wasn't as clear as I thought it was





Theory: Tuon knows that the truth about Suldam being able to channel will rip apart the Empire as the Seanchan wont be able to handle that there will be no real difference between Suldam and Damane (the dangerous animals)

Further eplanation: Despite learning the truth and grudgingly admitting that Suldam can channel I dont think Tuon ever wants to truly free the Damane as an endgame. Ever. She's too ruthless and Damane are her most valuable asset. She wants to send ambassadors to Egwene and make a show. The show is more so she can claim that her Damane know that they must be leashed and are in fact happy to do it, but at least she can keep her own Damane and claim the Damane know that being leashed is right for them. 

She didn't expect Egwenes counter demand of those who wish to leave being allowed to do so, and doubts any Seanchan born Damane would wish to leave.

So I say that this is possibly the authors solution to the Damane problem, or thousands of years public perceptions could change, and Damane may become a different force altogether, an honored army unit of considerable rank, no longer tortured slaves.


All starting from Tuon's sly plan to avoid backlash when the truth about Suldam being able to channel. Again

* A Song of Ice and Fire, and scope of the world building. Much less magic, much more medieval (WoT is more Renaissance), and much darker. Major characters die, wounds are serious business (no handy Nynaeve to fix you up), peasants get slaughtered, women get raped … not a nice world, and GRRM is a hell of a storyteller. These are the only books that I love on the same level as WoT.

* The Kingkiller Chronicles, at 2 books out and one more coming. It’s essentially the story of one guy, so the cast and scope are smaller, and there’s necessarily less world-building. The structure of the book is fantastic – the main character is in the “present,” relating his life story to a biographer. He’s unapologetic about editing his life to make it more exciting and cut out the boring parts, but he’s obviously fallen from what he was. So far, he’s only told the story of his life on the up-and-up (though not without temporary setbacks, and I really want to know what happens that leads to the fall.

* The Gentleman Bastards, about a couple of thieves/con-men in what is essentially a fantasy Venice. They’re page turners, and they’re hilarious. The two that are out are basically stand-alone stories, rather than one big story broken up into multiple volumes, but it looks like that’s going to start changing with book 3. Some world-building, not a huge amount, but it feels like Lynch is laying the groundwork for a bunch.

* Malazan Book of the Fallen, and Erikson drops you right in the middle of the story. The analogy I’ve used is like trying to start WoT with Crown of Swords. I was able to handle the first two books by reading slowly and carefully and frequently consulting the list of characters so I could remember who was who, but I got to the third book and realized that I didn’t feel like it was worth the effort.

So that’s a few of my opinions. Agree, let’s discuss!",,False,self,t5_2rdg1,False,Dice,
1352569621.0,12yy3l,What main characters will die/would you be fine with them dying?,JonnSnow,31,5,133,"BS has mentioned that he has some ""George RR Martin"" moments in aMoL. For any who don't know a) read a Song of Ice and Fire b) it means he kills off pretty main characters. So,,False
1352051347.0,12mbkr,Lord of Chaos (or Path of Daggers) question about Mat and Tylin...,Lord_Yeti,36,8,86,"~~Alright I don't quite remember when Tylin started a relationship with Mat but I'm pretty sure it was in Lord of Chaos or in Path of Daggers. So if you haven't read PoD then there may be spoilers. If you could tell me that would be great.~~ ***NEVERMIND IT'S A CROWN OF SWORDS SPOILERS BELOW ^^^^^so_sorry***

My question is if Tylin raped Mat. It's obvious why I think so because she *did* held him in knife point while he didn't want to have sex with her. I was a bit disturbed how it was written in a humorous manner so I'm just trying to clarify if I'm being too dramatic? Did RJ ever address this if this was the case? Also how come everyone was apparently okay with Mat's situation? He tried to actively escape but no one really paid attention to him.

Burn me but I could say it was traumatic to him if in a not negative way as he developed a liking for lace

So to reiterate

EDIT 1: Grammar

EDIT 2: So the general consensus is that he was raped but RJ may not have realized that what he thought was comical was actually pretty dark

This the the tought process that came to me while reading through the series again in preps for AMoL. More specifically when reading TSR Ch.1 and Min mentions that outside Tar Valon the ageless face of an Aes Sedai would only seem to be a woman who's age couldn't be placed to common folk; whereas there in the Tower proper it spoke immediately to a full Aes Sedai.

Now we know a few effects of the oath rod(s), it also cuts the life span of an Aes Sedai drastically. This is shown a few ways as seen upon meeting Alivia in particular being over 400 years old, though both the Aiel channelers and the Forsaken also not showing this and living to far higher ages further proves this point.

Now my theory on the original purpose of the Oath Rods is that they were only used on criminals, however this one wouldn't be disfiguring and would be nearly impossible to hide.

1357909749.0,16dl5g,Favourite character arc in AMoL (major AMoL spoilers),Candidate88766,26,4,60,"There were some great character arcs in AMoL. Rand and Egwene were particularly good in this book. Rand finally realising that he isn't responsible for everyone, most of the characters do.

There were some less than stellar character arcs. Moiraine didn't really do anything

However, he was never quite good enough. His lust for power is understandable: he doesn't want to be helpless, and he doesn't want the Black Tower to be helpless. His final moments in the book, choosing to help the people instead of seeking power were great. The moment when he realises that the people are looking at him with awe were, I think, incredibly powerful. He could've chosen the 'glory' of power, but he doesn't.

But I think Mat was the strongest of all the characters in this book. All three of the main men had great moments, Mat started the book again trying to avoid his. And when he finally does accept his duty, he is commanding the entire forces of the light near enough. Sanderson struggled with Mat to being with, but the Mat we see in this book more than makes up for that imo. While Rand's powers have always been at the forefront, and Perrin's wolfishness came into play into the last few books, I always felt that Mat's memories weren't being used to their potential. His luck was always his focus, and his memories only came up every now and again with him speaking a few lines here or there or commenting on a battle plan. And then we get a 200 page chapter focused around Mat's memories. He's not just an exceptionally luck gambler who can speak an ancient language. He's become the greatest of the great captains; a master of strategy and tactics to rival even Demandred or Hawkwing.

1343916676.0,xkaar,Major Wheel of Time Nostalgia after reading that Sanderson post yesterday.  Anyone else have life-memories tied to WoT?,absolut696,24,0,12,"It's amazing how books

I'm 27 now, I still remember the feeling of danger the night the trollocs invaded Tam al'Thor's farm house, the sense of adventure as the boys set out from Two Rivers and got their first taste of city-life, and the sense of how epic this was going to get as I realized how big and magical the world that Robert Jordan had crafted really was.

I don't know if I actually was a sick middle-schooler, etc. and I missed out on all the books after Winter's Heart. I took about a 7 year break from WoT, but they were always still a part of me.

Last year I started my first Re-read (starting over so I could remember as well as pick up things I might have missed in my youth).  The nostalgia was intense.  Reading through EotW and TGH and the rest of the books I had read already I would remember bits and pieces of my childhood.  Certain chapters would remind me of the chicken soup or beef stew my Mom would make.  Some books would remind me of that snowstorm we had and the feeling of comfort of sitting with a favorite book in a comfortable house.  Characters would remind me of songs on the radio at the time.  That was one of the most satisfying things I've ever experienced now that I'm an ""adult"" working a 9-5, and generally doing adult-like things, it hits home even harder, there's even a sense of melancholy to it.

I slogged through the ""boring books"" which to me, or suggest skipping chapters.  Then i arrived at TGS and ToM.  Holy Mother of the Creator.  Thank you Brandon Sanderson.  I noticed little differences in the writing style etc, but those books were AMAZING.  If you are reading this, what you did with all the characters was amazing.  I can't wait to read your other books soon.  Anyway, after reading his blog post yesterday the nostalgia hit me, and something that has been a part of my life for 17/27 years will come to a close.  That is very significant, but one day I will share it with my kids

As a newcomer to the series as of about 6 months or so I was deeply saddened when I finished KoD and I knew what events took place that stopped Mr. Jordan from completing his work. I was also upset at myself for never having heard or picked up one of his books until this last year when they had been around for nearly all of my life. I don't dream about a book a read often but there is something about this series that feels so close to being plausible that my sleep is filled with visions and stories from these books. So I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you to Robert and everyone else that helped out with this series.

1362367434.0,19m6xc,Mysticism and Origins of the Wheel of Time (Spoilers all),AxisTilt,26,4,5,"Ok, etc.  It's about the structure of the WOT universe

So, it's similar to the [Stephen R Donaldson's Arch of Time from Thomas Covenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant), he made it and cannot now reach into the pattern for fear of destroying his creation.  The pattern was the world created by the Wheel of Time and the by-product of the Creator's power.  If you are familiar with [Zelazny's Amber series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber), it's similar to the Pattern and Logrus.  This might also explain the existence of a world that in many ways mirrors our own, that as a by product there are actually many universes, one of which is ours, one of which is Rand's &amp; co's.  Even one with King Arthur, it's kind of like a fail safe for the Wheel created by the Creator.  While they are created by the Wheel

The One Power and the True Source, while the One Power is using the pattern to filter his essence.  Using either, you can change, shape, and even burn out (balefire) sections of the pattern.  When Saidin was tainted, that filter was damaged.

This also fits with the popular theories on how [Rand lit his pipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/177idx/rands_pipe_spoilers_all/).  Now that he understands the nature of the pattern (from his battle with the Dark One), doesn't it?).  This understanding wasn't really sudden either, he starts to understand a lot as evidenced by his chat with Cadsuane (where he threatened to stop her heart using this) and when he was using his Ta'veren abilities to stop the Dark One's influence (many times after the scene on the Dragonmount).

I understand this pulls on some different literary sources and so might be influenced by my reading of Fantasy/Sci-Fi

tl;dr The Balance to the True Source is the Pattern and Ta'veren abilities.

1361188197.0,18qvy8,My review of AMoL [Heavy AMoL spoilers throughout],OremLK,31,10,28,"Let me preface this with a warning: This is going to be a mixed review with a few points of fairly sharp criticism.  I also want to preface it by saying that I love Brandon's work and that he was one of my favorite fantasy authors even before I first picked up *The Eye of the World* some five or six years ago.

Now that I've read through the series

Yet I still found myself torn about AMoL and the three-book conclusion of the series as a whole.  There are parts of it I love

Why?  I think a large part of it is the number of issues Jordan apparently wanted to leave ambiguous, and I don't like that it's the case for either of them:

* Rand's insanity.  This was addressed somewhat in the merging of Rand and Lews Therin in TGS

* Rand's death and body switch (with Alivia's help).  Brandon has said over and over again that Jordan wanted this to be left ambiguous.  For something so important and so heavily foreshadowed I dislike being left so much in the dark about it

Then there are the things I feel didn't tie into the last battle strongly enough given how much they were foreshadowed--not sure in this case how much was due to RJ's outline and how much Brandon had control over:

* Ta'veren connection (seeing colors and such)--I was sure this would have some direct link with how Rand would ultimately defeat the Dark One.   Not sure why the three of them needed to constantly see where each other were for so many books

* The two wounds and bleeding on Shayol Ghul: With as much as this was built up to, I thought it was heavily foreshadowed that Rand's wounds gave him some kind of connection to both TDO and Mashadar.  I didn't have some specific idea what relevance this would have, but I felt so certain it would matter in some way, and then it didn't seem to have any effect.

* Padan Fain: This ties into the one above

* The Seanchan.  This was touched on more than most of the others so I can give it a *slight* pass

Those are the biggest plot arcs where I felt dissatisfied with the conclusions.  I also want to say that I felt the battle scenes dragged at times, trying to stride that line where you're epic enough without being tedious, and if Brandon stepped into the tedious side occasionally, I suppose it's understandable.

Now

* Pevara and Androl were an awesome storyline.  I really liked Androl and I liked how Pevara became a more fleshed out and sympathetic character.  I also liked the idea of Androl's gateway talent and how it resulted in some fun Portal-esque Shadow-killin'.

* Egwene's death was beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time.  I'm still a little upset about it

* Even though I complained about major plot threads a lot, are you *serious* with this crap?"" Like I have with some long-running SF/F stories (COUGH, Battlestar Galactica).  I break free of the Wheel with a sense of mild disappointment, but none of that sharp betrayal of an ending gone horribly wrong.  For the most part there was no deus ex machina and the resolutions to various things (the ones actually explained) made sense--it was more that too many mysteries were left out of reach, but with the sense that there *was* an answer, and some things were resolved in too trite of ways.  My point is, to conclude a story this huge with just mild disappointment is actually a success, and this was more of a mediocre finish than a bad one.

* Most of the characters' voices were impeccable.  There was an occasional jarring moment

* The number of minor storylines which were resolved in some way or another is nothing short of impressive.  I'm not going to start rattling off example after example

Anyway, while not as great as I had hoped, at least achieves a passing grade.

That said, while there are common complaints about certain things that were drawn out for way too long. So what would you change? How would you alter the story in order to get to the same place, but perhaps have a different journey along the way?

My big edit became apparent as I drew to the end of AMoL. Here's what I think I would do

I would delete Malden. It wouldn't even be a thing. The Shaido would have remained scattered and been hunted down in all the nations through which they were scattered.

Instead, totally distrusting of Aes Sedai, filches it from the White Tower and taps Perrin to hunt down Mat and get it to him.

Then we get the same thing, Faile, and co. end up in the Blight.

Now, and he grows closer to his wife through the incredible danger. Maybe they even end up with Masema and the Dragonsworn there somehow, and Faile takes care of them, I don't care.

So the battered and broken survivors of the horrific journey finally make their way out of the Blight and to a village

Adventure adventure adventure, plot plot plot, and Perrin leads an army of the Sharans who doubted Demandred's street cred into the Aiel Waste, find Rhuidean, and hitch a ride to the Last Battle.

No Whitecloaks. We closed that storyline back in the Two Rivers. Masema can come along if you really want him, because it was Mat who was supposed to nail them down all along. Instead, let's get a ta'veren to Shara!

I think a good traveling adventure like this would have brought the series back to its roots

I've read it over a few times

&gt;Suddenly Rand realized what had been nagging at him about the man. The scattered torches in the hallway had given each of them a ring of shadows, seeming taller. ""It is decided."" Abruptly there was no seeming to it. Like a balloon Mordeth swelled, distorted, head pressed against the ceiling, shoulders butting the walls, filling the end of the room, cutting off escape. Hollow-cheeked, he reached out with hands big enough to engulf a man's head.

&gt;With a yell Rand leaped back. His feet tangled in a gold chain, he struggled at the same time for his sword, fighting his cloak, which had become wrapped around the hilt. The yells of his friends filled the room, and the clash of goldplatters and goblets clattering across the floor. Suddenly an agonized scream shivered in Rand's ears. Almost sobbing, he managed to inhale at last, just as he got the sword out of its sheath. Cautiously, wondering which of his friends had given that scream. Perrin looked back at him wide-eyed from across the room, clutching his knees to his chest and huddled as deep into the furthest comer as he could get.

&gt;""He tricked us, and he almost dropped the sword as well. As Mordeth dove through the air, he stretched out and thinned, like a tendril of smoke. As thin as a finger he struck a crack in the wall tiles and vanished into it. A last cry hung in the room as he vanished, fading slowly away after he was gone. ""You are all dead!""

The mysteries are:

1. The agonizing scream

2. Mordeth's posture (huddled in the corner)

3. Mat's reaction (what did he do/see to know it was a trick?)

4. Mordeth just leaving

""No man can stand in the Shadow so long that he cannot find the Light again.""

It's one of the first repeated quotes in the entire Wheel of Time series. With A Memory of Light being an end to the series

There's a lot with turning to the Dark One. The forces of the Dark have the circle of thirteen channelers linked with thirteen Myrddraal to convert a channeler to the Dark One. It's speculated (confirmed?) that the Black Tower is corrupted by this. 

Like everything in Randland

I theorize that at least some of the Darkfriends/Forsaken we have seen will play a pivotal role in the final book. Characters such as Lanfear/Cyndane

Especially in the cases of Lanfear and Ishmael

The assistance of one of these two (or both), several of the Forsaken are still lose. There are only a few strong channelers on the side of the Light. There's Rand, and some of the strongest females, but there's basically no confirmed male channelers but Logain, who is lost. At least there's Callandor, but there's also the question of the second-strongest sa'angreal.

Even in numbers

The Last Battle will, and the Dragon the Champion of the Light, then they would need to fight. They are equal in power and skill. How would Rand first defeat him and then fight the Dark One?

Furthermore

Ishmael supports the Dark One purely because of his criticism of the Wheel of Time. He hopes that something will change. Rand has had his revelation that love is what matters

Asmodean is said to have already returned to the Light. Maybe he may make another appearance? If the Dark can return lost souls

Rand is not sealing the dark one away
  
The flame represents everything, because he knows the truth of it, and therefore has no ignorance, where ignorance is bliss. hence No Bliss, or Nae'Blis(He was a philospher and very logical before Lanfear unleashed the dark one.)  
  
So, as everything must be in balance, is that Everything(the white half) must then be a lie.
Further
  
Therefore, it balances the fact that nothing essentially does not exist, while being the only thing possible to exist.  
  
Pretty crazy as hell to wrap your head around that last bit haha. So essentially you have the dark one(nothing/black half) trying to crush everything so it can truly be nothing while Everything(the white half/the pattern) seeks to fill the endlessness in an eternal and unwinnable battle

The Dark One can also break unbreakable Cuendillar, the Betrayer of Hope, is kind of...the only hope. Rand is the White half, Moridin the Dark, and without one or the other, the bore could not have been sealed.
  
They both represent the pinnacles of good or evil in men. Anyways, not into one. Read it, think about it.  
  
**Edit: Modern theories suggest a creator cannot exist within it's creation, in the eternal void of the Dark One. Outside of the pattern, not in a prison of the pattern.

**Come

**You're damned**

**Cause noone can defy me**

Just watch these maddened creatures

Like you the all once reached out

A war to win

But I'm gonna burn this vision down

Call me the father of lies

Just watch these saddened creatures

They've turned you into their savior

You hold your ground

Until your last breath

You'll twist

And now you're falling down

And forever and ever

*Let ages come and go*

*The wheel will turn*

**Another ride into obsession**

*I am reborn*

**The wheel will turn now**

(*The wheel will turn*)

**And I am driven to obsession**

All these dying men

Try to understand

They all followed the sign

It's a cycle's end

There's no hope

For a while

From the ashes arise

Can't save her

Enjoy the flames

So precious

And you try

You're sure to fail

And madness

Is the price you've to pay

Unholy grounds

Witness your last breath

The cycle ends

And you're stumbling

*The battle will go on*

*And forever and ever*

*It's raging on*

Let ages come and go

The wheel will turn now

*The wheel will turn*

Another ride into obsession

I am reborn

**The wheel will turn now**

And I am driven to obsession

Through the flames you'll see me

You'll be mine

This is the moment I long for

Wake up

And right now while the land lies bleeding

It's me

*Still I'll be on my way*

*Oh

*I pray*

**And over and over and over again**

**There is no beginning**

No end

This war

And forever and ever

I will return

*Let ages come and go*

**The wheel will turn now**

*The wheel will turn*

**Another ride into obsession**

*I am reborn*

The wheel will turn now

And I am driven to obsession

*Light

**True source reign over me**

*Light

There's no end and

There's no beginning

You will never be alone

Since when can we tie off gateways?  I thought it was stated previously that this could not be done.  If it can, etc.  I do like that Sanderson expanded upon the use of gateways; they have so much potential that I felt was unused.

1)	Burn those bloody white cloaks

2)	Perrin is easily my favorite character. His story line nearly brought me to tears twice in book 4. Loail would be a close second. Fitting for me that they are traveling together now.

3)	I have never trusted Thom Merrilin

4)	For being a former town wisdom

5)	As much as the women in the books like to think they are running things

6)	Did I mention I really don’t like the white cloaks?

7)	Elaine and Min are 2 of the woman that Min saw surrounding Rand. I am not sure yet who the third is. I am thinking Egwene

8)	The siege of Tar Valon was heart wrenching as well. Black Ajah all of them.

9)	What happened to Uno and the rest of the Borderlanders? I might have missed
