****

**EVERYONE GET ON BOARD THE MURDER EXPRESS!! IT'S TIME TO BRING YOUR PAIN GAME, AND GET READY TO BUST SOME SKULLS!!**
****
&gt;What you will be bringing to the fight
****


First things first

1. **Biotic Charge**: The **TRAIN** of **MURDERTRAIN**'ing. For the build that I will show you

1. **Carnage**: A projectile that has some pretty gnarly reload times. And by gnarly I mean terribad. It has it's uses, it is. Our goal will be to cut down on Cooldown. Taking this will defeat that purpose, as our next talent...


3. **Barrier**: **THE MOTHER OF ALL TECH ARMORS.** Not only will you get a boost to your **MASSIVE** shields
4. **Krogan Battlemaster**: Oh

No. Really. Next time you're in a game with Krogans

**BECAUSE THEY AREN'T THE MURDERTRAIN INCARNATE!!**

Take the Power bonus over the Weapon bonus. Except maybe slot 6. But we'll cover that later.

For those wondering

****
&gt;How to put the **PAIN** in **MURDERTRAIN** (can't you spell?)
****


**:HEADBUTT:** I can spell just *fine*.

So where do we go with this?  We know we won't use Carnage. And Rage is the same as Soldiers/Sentinels in clan Krogan. So how do you **MURDERTRAIN**?

Let's go down the list:

**Biotic Charge**:Damage(Radius)/Melee Synergy/Barrier

*MELEE SYNERGY IS UNIQUE TO KROGAN VANGUARD*


I chose Damage over Radius for the sole reason that I want to deal as much damage as possible when I charge into someone. You can take whatever you'd like here.  It's really up to you.  You hit the force of train, which is why I prefer the single damage dealer.  You could argue that taking radius is supposed to help, but to each their own. Damage, or Stun.  Melee synergy is there for this wonderful trick: RIGHT after you charge, hold down melee.  You will do your Heavy Melee. Then follow up with a melee.  Very little can withstand this combo.  If *that* doesn't work, shotgun. Rinse, repeat. Barrier is for shield recharge.

~~Carnage:~~ We're skipping this.  Too much cooldown for us.

**Barrier**:Blast Effect/Power Synergy/Power Recharge

Now here's my reasoning behind this.

The idea is to not **TANK**.  While our goal is to melee

First, you play smart anyway).  Blast Effect will do a couple things for us. First of all, it gives us an AoE attack that can shove enemies out of our way with a pretty quick cooldown.  Plus, it will give the humorous effect of lifting enemies into the air around us.  You can combo into these 'floaters' with Biotic Charge, if you'd like.  I like using this when I'm surrounded by Husks, Soldiers, Swarmers

Power Synergy turns Biotic Charge from a **MURDERTRAIN** into a **MURDER-FREIGHT-TRAIN**.  You'll reliably 1HKO Cannibals and all other Squishies with a Biotic Charge (tested with Damage upgrade) on Bronze

The cooldown reduction should make sense.  We want to reduce our cooldown

**Krogan Battlemaster**: Damage &amp; Capacity/Power Damage/Shotgun Weight

The goal here is to up our power damage for the **MURDERTRAIN A COMIN'** and lower our cooldown.  This accomplishes that.  You *can* take weapon damage for the last spot

**RAAAAAAAAAAGE**: Durability/Martial Artist/Fitness Expert

Self explanatory
****
&gt;What weapon should I take?
****


**WELL THAT'S A SILLY QUESTION!**

Honestly, AND MAKES KROGAN PROUD*, but VERY heavy.  Katana X is light, as is the Scimitar.  Go with what makes you happy, and comfortable, but I prefer shotguns.  Adjust accordingly in ""Krogan Battlemaster"" if you aren't taking a shotgun into battle.

**THAT'S IT! YOU ARE READY TO MURDER SQUISHY LITTLE THINGS! Just remember! Fight smart! You're not invincible

1334756289.0,sfyzl,Mass Effect Co-op Comprehensive Beginner's Guide,PIngp0NGMW,223,19,68,"Welcome to the wonderful world of ME Co-Op.  Since there are always posts every few days asking for advice for getting started out

**EDIT**: Updated as of October 23

**1.  Getting started**

ME Co-Op is first and foremost a team game.  This means you live or die by the quality of your team.  You need to work together in order to succeed, of course, but at the end of the match all points are aggregated and experience is divided equally.  Points make you feel like you did more but they don’t really matter.  Be a team player.


Each match consists of 10 rounds + 1 extraction round.  Each wave is more difficult than the last.  On Waves 3


* Hack: you have to find the hacking terminal and activate it to start the hack.  You must stand in the hacking circle in order for the bar to fill up.  You have a limited time to do this.  **It is almost always the best idea for all four party members to stand in the circle and defend it.**  Four players hacking make the progress bar increase significantly faster.  Enemies also spawn infinitely while you are hacking so the longer it takes


* Capture: this involves running around the map and activating four different devices by standing there and holding down the activation button.  The devices are randomly spawned around the map and must be activated sequentially.  Strategies for this include all four players going to the device and guarding it while one player activates.  However, activate the device while the rest of the team “aggros” (aggravates/draws the enemy into attacking) them somewhere else.


* Assassinate: this involves sequentially killing four randomly assigned enemy units.  You have a fairly limited amount of time to do this although you gain extra time for each assassinated target.


* Collect Objective: this was newly introduced in the Rebellion DLC (May 29, and walking it back to the drop-off point.   You cannot run while holding the objective, as you will drop it immediately if you do.  If you are cloaked you will also immediately de-cloak.  You can otherwise take cover and move normally.  This is pretty straight-forward: one person collects and the others protect.  The second objective spawns randomly as soon as you return the first one.  

* Escort: you must run to a designated spot on the map and activate a drone.  The drone then makes it way to another spot on the map as long as a player is next to it.  The drone moves faster if there are more players near it and the drone will periodically recharge your shields.  Escort missions can be tough as it necessarily draws you out into the open.

You are awarded credits after each successful objective wave and bonus credits based on how fast you do it.  Even if you all die and fail the mission


The extraction wave is last and involves being in the extraction circle at the end of two minutes.  It is not necessary to be in the circle for the whole two minutes, as long as you extract you get the bonus credits.


The game has four levels of difficulty: Bronze (easiest), and Platinum (hardest).  The game’s default setting is to match you to ANY level of difficulty.  Do yourself a favour and select Bronze when you are first starting out.  Even after you have lots of experience, Bronze is the best way for experimenting and trying out a new class.  There are fewer enemies, they are easier, and you will spend more time fighting and less time dead.  


Winning matches raises your Galactic Readiness Score in single player.  If you have 100% GRS in multiplayer


**2.  Consumables**

In the game you have 4 types of consumables, Medi Gels, and Thermal Clips.  These are all limited use items.  You carry a limited number into battle and these are drawn from your total pool of these items.  Items you don’t use in a match go back into your pool but if your total pool is empty you won’t bring any into the match.  

**EDIT:** Some additional pointers in Thermal and Ops packs thanks to Chetyre


* Cobra Missiles: these are Instant Kill emergency weapons.  They will instantly kill any enemy they hit in a fairly large radius.  They will NOT damage you or your team mates as there is no friendly fire.  DO NOT waste these on small easy enemies or even large groups of easy enemies.  These should be reserved for Banshees, etc.  Also, don’t waste Cobras when you are working on an Atlas or some other heavy and it’s the last unit.  Just kill it with conventional weapons.  If you are running out of time on an Assassinate objective, Cobras are very useful for quickly taking out an enemy.  Cobras often miss if your aim is poor or there is a lot of lag.  You can help yourself by firing at the feet of the enemy.


* Ops Packs: these instantly restore your health and shields.  Use carefully though.  Sometimes there is a split second of lag and you may use the pack and still die.  Take cover first.  Ops packs can basically double your Medi Gel capacity if your timing is good.


* Medi Gels: these instantly revive you when you are incapacitated.  Be very careful using these as Medi Gels and Cobras are probably the most used items and therefore in the shortest supply.  DO NOT waste these on wave 1 or by popping it instantly.  It’s a good idea to keep spamming the spacebar (or equivalent) until you’re nearly out of time and then use it; this gives time for team mates to come revive you.  Keep in mind that sometimes it is better to stay down.  If there are two Geth Primes standing on your body


* Thermal Packs: these instantly refill your ammo.  You won’t likely use these much as ammo is generally plentiful around the map.  However


There are also weapon, there is now a description of what the bonus does.

**EDIT:** Weapon bonuses only apply to the specific weapon type.  So for example, however, do apply to any weapon you choose. *thanks to JadeEmpress for this clarification*


**3. Characters**

There are six classes of characters: Adept, Engineer, Infiltrator, and Vanguard.  Within each class are several different races.  When you gain levels by earning experience, you level up the entire class not the individual unit.  This means that if you level a Krogan Soldier to 20 (the maximum) then if you create a Human Soldier she will be level 20 automatically.


You put points into skills

**EDIT:** At level 20


When a class reaches level 20, some people never promote so are very good with low N7 scores and some people are awful with N7 scores in the multi-hundreds.  With the latest patch when you promote all the skills points for that class are unassigned, so you don't have the 1 default point assigned.  This is a good thing.

We would like all memes to be posted to ~~/r/masseffect~~ /r/masseffectmeme for now. THIS IS NOT A PERMA BAN ON MEMES. We will soon get a poll to see who does or does not want memes. We are here to make this place the best we can

Please stop and think before you post a rant. This is a positive place and there is NO ACCEPTANCE of hate/racism(krogan are people too)/descrimination/sexism. Rants also bring very little to the subreddit. A post doing nothing but complaining about a player, and other simply negative posts will are not welcome. Giving advice to the krogans about not standing in front of other players is okay as long as it is not negative or rude.

Pictures of your packages, and so on are also something that may be considered MECoOP specific but bring little to the actual subreddit. It is very nice you got your Black Widow to X but we didn't need to know. Tell us how the X level BW works and it is okay. Also, pictures with text in them that could simply be used in a text based post should not be used normally just to farm Karma.

Again

Edit: Also

Edit 2: Also, and anything that does contribute to the subreddit or conversation. The downvote should be used if the person or post does not contribute to the subreddit/conversation, if they are rude or negative, and so on.

Edit 3: Thanks for all the feedback. Again, rants are about a 50/50 good/bad ratio. Memes are around a 20/80 good/bad as are pictures. Some think that if we take out the memes, negative rants, pictures of items and packages, and so on, it will ruin our subreddit. I disagree. Many places have taken out memes and it has worked well. I don't want this place to become a go to place for memes and a quick laugh.

Hey everyone, the team is moving on to new and exciting projects.

I just wanted to say that our team has really enjoyed interacting with the community this past year through weekend events, and the community definitely taught us a lot about our own game through amazing gameplay videos and in depth analysis of our weapons, powers, and kits. I know Mass Effect 3 multiplayer was a bit controversial when it was announced, but I think it’s safe to say it was a huge success. 

Although weekend events and balance changes are finished

Its always the same missions with just different characters and 1 new gametype

My idea: Take missions and locations from ME3 (possibly even some ME2 locations

The first thing that comes to mind for me would be the mission on Palaven's moon when you meet up with Garrus.

---------

**Start Mission**

**Wave 1:** after the team lands

**Wave 2:** Take out more enemies, but then...

**Waves 3-5:** complete a few waves here

**Wave 6:** Defend the wall. A new Objective type exclusive to this map. Enemies will come from over the wall, then I think the enemy numbers in later waves double instead of a ""Mission Failed"" screen. But thats an opinion I have. Anyway...

**Wave 7:** Head up to the AA gun and ""Hack the Point

**Wave 8:** Staying in the area

**Wave 9:** get back to the base you came from and destroy the enemies that entered from the nearby airfield

**Wave 10:** Pizza delivery time! This time you have to carry 2 items from the base to the airfield nearby. this is tricky because there is only ONE way over

**Extraction wave:** Stay in the LZ at the airfield and hold out. enemies will come from all around it

**Mission Accomplished!**

-----------

As you see from my idea

But with this game-mode

Of course this all depends on IF the servers are more stable; people being able to drop in/out; and also if these are paid or free missions (because of all the hate for Bioware at the moment).

So

**TL;DR** - Remember Palaven, kinda. Thats my idea

EDIT: Some clarifications.

1. I'm not saying these would just be SP missions with 4 players. I'm saying to take SP levels and missions and use them to make a form of MP mission system. Like Battlefield 3 or CoD. Maybe those are bad examples

2. This would definitely need to be a new MP mode just so people looking for Classic MP won't get thrown into wave 10 of this type of a game.

1335885056.0,t1k15,The Biotic Throwdown: in-depth human sentinel tactics and character building,ginja_ninja,116,18,57,"Sentinel has been my favorite class since ME2. I was discouraged when I started reading that it was one of the worst classes in ME3 multiplayer a month or two ago. After I had finished the game and subsequently repressed any knowledge I had of the ending, and makes me even sadder when I join a pub and see someone playing human sentinel finish at the bottom of the scoreboard. When played correctly

All right, considering how important it is for powers-based classes to get 200% cooldown bonus. Let's take a look at the actual numbers here though: the difference in warp cooldown between a human sentinel with 200% and 170% cooldown is .2 seconds. The difference in throw cooldown is .13 seconds. This is so negligible that it can't with any honesty be counted as a genuine disadvantage, especially considering what you gain. Rank 5 of tech armor provides you with a 20% boost to power force and damage. This is a very important distinction for people who start comparing the class to asari adept (**also, I'm in no way trying to invalidate the awesomeness of asari adept in this thread, it's a great class that I thoroughly enjoy playing. However, I believe that although they have similar abilities, human sentinel and asari adept actually play fairly differently in practice, they are essentially an asari adept with weaker powers, so I'm not sure whether to add 30% or divide by 70%, the only thing you are gaining by eschewing tech armor for fitness is .2 seconds of warp cooldown

That's right, throw (in case you haven't noticed, we have officially segued from boring build discussion into awesome gameplay strategies), throw, throw. **This is what you do as human sentinel. You throw.** You throw as many things as you can, as often as you can. Think of each throw you toss as a mini vanguard you're sending charging at enemies every 1.36 seconds.Asari adepts have a lot more options than throw for dealing with enemies, and they tend to use them. As a human sentinel with the most powerful throw in the game, because you have a throw, you shouldn't waste your time. Those enemies are not worth your time. The only thing they are good for is getting thrown. You can decimate entire groups of unprotected enemies with just your throw. Even on gold, then rinse and repeat. It's one of the most efficient ways of laying waste to groups of trash mobs in the entire game. Throw curving becomes something of an art form

Hopefully, I'm not focused on support so much as I am focused on moving around and fucking everything I see's shit up as fast as humanly possible. That's what the human sentinel is, an asari adept that's focused on pure offense rather than a balance of offense and support. **Your sole purpose as human sentinel is to nuke the fuck out of everything with your powers until nothing is left to stand against you.** You can be more aggressive because of your additional health and shields, coupled with the extremly important fact that your dodge roll doesn't reset your shield recharge (more on this and why it's important later). Where an asari adept is going to be supporting with stasis and detonations from safely behind or alongside the rest of her teammates, a human sentinel is going to be blazing the trail ahead of them, deftly moving from cover to cover while dodging weapons fire and cutting through groups of enemies like a knife. Most classes are afraid of banshees. When a human sentinel sees a banshee, his eyes turn into 2 dollar signs an an audible ""cha-ching!"" sound is heard. Between your biotic explosions and your godlike throw

Now, but only if you let them. Protip: don't let them. Say, ""Fuck your combat roll son, I ain't no punk bitch human sentinel, I AM A **BIOTIC GOD, A TECH ARMORED DARK ENERGY SLINGER THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN!**"" Do not let the combat roll make you its bitch. Kill the combat roll's parents and feed them to the combat roll in the form of chili.

The first and best way to shit in the combat roll's mouth is to simply avoid using warp on any enemies with a combat roll to set up your biotic explosions. For example, you can hit them with the warp since they can't dodge at all, then detonate it, which will kill all cannibals and husks in the radius and at the very least strip the marauder's shields. The marauder will then be staggered from the explosion and can easily be deprived of saving Shepard from the horror of the ending with a single throw.

Now, then immediately fire off a warp.** The phalanx is the perfect gun for this because of its fast firing rate. It will stagger targets very quickly and ensure they can't dodge your warp. Even if they dodge the followup throw, the throw cooldown is so fast it will be finished by the time you've even seen them dodge the first one and you can toss another one to seal the deal. Punk bitches can't dodge twice.

Against cerberus and the geth, you can use them to set up dodge-free explosions to slay anything remotely near them. Geth primes are the only geth without any sort of a dodge, but cloaked hunters tend to almost never dodge until they've run out of shields and decloaked, so they make excellent warp targets. You simply need to shoot them with your weapon to light them up and make them flicker, then your warp will be able to lock on.

**HAPPY ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
-
*POSTED ON MARCH 7

Months have passed and seasons have changed since we released Mass Effect 3—many of which here in Edmonton containing snow—and yet it’s still hard to believe that an entire year has gone by! From beginning to end it has been an amazing experience

We dove further into Commander Shepard’s adventure with the From Ashes, the last surviving Prothean, learn more about the origin of the Reapers, and revisit the Omega space with Aria. We also saw an opportunity to expand upon the events at the end of Commander Shepard’s journey with the Extended Cut DLC.

We are extremely proud of the work done by our multiplayer team, and dozens of new weapons and upgrades.  And let’s not forget the Collectors, and entirely new enemy faction and the return of the dreaded Praetorian.

To help us in celebrating this milestone

My story with mass effect is an odd one. I had no previous experience with the mass effect series, but one day we got into an argument over the fact that he wouldn't ever play any vidya with me. So I promptly went out and bought it there and then. Didn't tell him, until I called him on skype later and waited till he logged into PSN and saw what I was playing. Dude was on the verge of tears he was so moved by the fact I had bought a game for no other reason other than to play with him, while I biotic charged someone on bronze and had no idea wtf had just happened. That person is known here as Exxtrooper.

Then I discovered /r/MeCoOp shortly after the Resurgence DLC came out. I lurked for a bit, I was soon playing gold pugs in no time at all. I had my first post removed by Carbon, and I called everyone out on the 'geth were buffed' threads. I continued posting though, and made a few builds, and made more friends over PSN to play with.

Drellstep, Piranha, vanguard glitches, Glacier box of shame, hard infiltrator nerfs and then the infamous buffing of the geth later, and I became a moderator of this place. Carbon started having IRL things to deal with, and the subreddit began to become unregulated. I piped up and offered to help out, I was added as a mod, and took it out on some stupid balance change. Regrettably, I greatly appreciate it. However

RepShred was a mod ever since it crossed my mind. I promised him that. I did feel like I should 'recruit' more than one mod though, call of duty is still shit, so I came back naturally). I made a post announcing that SWfanboy and Pantsonhead were to be the new supreme rulers. A decision I have no regretted. This place is better than it ever has been. And I speak for all of us when I say that the 3 mods of this place do a fantastic job. I can't praise them enough. We are over 5000 members strong now. Something which would not have been possible without the changes that were invoked. So to RepublicanShredder, ImNotASWFanboy and PantsOnHead719, congratulations for giving this community the lifespan it has gotten. 

None of you really have any idea how much of a getaway from my personal life this community has been, none of this would ever have happened. 

So you can stop downvoting all our shit now for no reason whatsoever. Hurts our feelings you know.

Seriously though. Thankyou. Thank you all for making me so happy and proud to be a part of something great.

1358761312.0,16zcwq,ME Co-Op College 501:  Making the Jump to Gold,InterwebNinja,110,15,65,"####OVERVIEW

This guide is a compilation of information relevant to making the jump from Bronze / Silver up to Gold.  It assumes you have knowledge of the game's basic mechanics as covered in earlier articles in this series.  While this information applies to all difficulties

The guide starts with some of the mechanics you will want to consider when designing builds

#### MECHANICS

There are a few more advanced mechanics which are important to understand before making decisions on your builds and loadouts in Gold+.  They are covered here briefly.

***Enemy Armor***

When shooting against enemy armor

* Gold / Platinum - 50
* Silver - 30
* Bronze - 15

At higher difficulties, equipment, or ability.  Note, most shotgun shots are 8 individual pellets, and each pellet suffers the armor penalty.  There are ways to mitigate this, and they will be covered below.

***Shieldgate***

When you attack an enemy with shields / barriers, this percentage is 25%.

For example, the first 200 would strip the shields, and the remaining 800 would be reduced to 800 * 0.25 = 200.  Thus, a shot that would normally do 1000 damage only does 400 damage in total.

This is important to consider when speccing for high damage-per-bullet weapons (e.g. single-shot sniper rifles).  If your first shot doesn't do enough to strip an enemy's shields

Note

***Cooldown***

Based on the weapons and mods you equip, the difference between 200% and 150% is not the same as the difference between 150% and 100%.  In the former case, for a power with a relatively long base cooldown like Biotic Charge (10 seconds), the difference is about 0.6 seconds.  In the latter case, the difference would be about 1.0 second.

In practice, a 200% bonus should not be a goal when deciding on your loadouts, even on caster classes.  You are often likely to get more benefit from carrying a better / heavier weapon and suffering a penalty to your cooldown.

If you want to see more numbers on the cooldowns

One other thing to note with respect to the Power Recharge Speed Bonus is that it is bugged for the weapon mods that add weight.  For any weapon that was not released through DLC

***Combos***

While knowing which powers are capable of priming and detonating Biotic or Tech combos is critical, depending on the enemy protection.  The table below lists each type of combo, as well as the multiplier it receives against each enemy defense type.

Power|Health|Barriers|Shields|Armor
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Biotic|1|2|1|2
Fire|1|1|1|2
Tech|1|1|2|1
Cryo|1|1|1|1

As a side note, Cryo Explosions primed by it receive a 2x multiplier against all enemy defenses.

Another important thing to note with respect to combos is that the strength of explosions depends on the rank of the powers used to prime / detonate them.  Two rank 6 powers used to prime / detonate will have a much stronger explosion than two rank 3 powers.  For this reason, Cryo, or Disruptor) are the same as combos primed by a rank 1 power.  In addition, Ammo powers are not guaranteed to prime a target, but higher rank Ammos have a higher probability to prime.  The likelihood of priming a target varies by Ammo rank and gun.  Projectile weapons (e.g. Falcon, Graal, Kishock, but results vary with other weapons.  The best practice is to just watch the enemy.  You will be able to see the effect when they have been primed.

Powers and Ammo that prime can layer on top of each other.  That means that if a teammate throws Warp on a target and you then hit it with Overload, as the Biotic Explosion would be much more powerful than the Tech Burst against armor.  If the target is hit by a second detonating biotic power, though, a Biotic Explosion will be set off (provided Warp's priming effect is still active).  This principle applies to some Ammo (Disruptor, Cyro, Incendiary) as well - they can layer on top of other primers (though Cryo will only prime / override on targets down to health).

Finally, which are additive) and should almost always be taken.  The bonuses for Electric Slash and Snap Freeze are bugged, though, so don't bother taking those *(edit - testing reveals that the multiplicative tech combo bonus on the AIU works (evolution 6a), so it's definitely worth considering)*.",,False,t5_2tkk1,True

A user from GameFAQ played with a Bioware employee earlier today
&gt;We played unknown/reapers on gold for almost 10 straight hours


&gt;I bombarded him with a lot of questions

&gt;Vanguard glitch cannot be fixed without a huge overhaul of the original programming, the game thinks you are inside of the cover, hence you fall through the map. I did not know this! He said they could put a patch in that would simply not allow you to charge places that could result in glitches, but that this would render vanguards useless and unfun
He mentioned that they could not simply reset a glitched player without having to overhaul the programming.

&gt;When I asked him about smash being overpowered he mentioned that it has already been talked about and that the most likely nerf would be to the recharge speed

&gt;He confirmed the studio is aware ultralight materials still do not work but they haven't figured out what is causing the bug and that simply adding more code would not fix the problem because it would overlap with the existing one.

&gt;Mass effect mp suffers regular server overload during the heavier traffic times of the day. So if you think your connection is just acting funny

&gt;There is a natural handicap built into the mp so that the person leading the scoreboard has a 100% chance of getting ohko'd during a grab sequence

&gt;Another handicap is rocket troopers, so the leader isn't being hunted. They also have a greater frequency of firing double rockets at the leader, In case you've ever been surprised by that.

&gt;I didn't know this

&gt;When I asked if earth would be the last mp dlc he actually laughed at me and explained they are making way more money developing mp content than they would single player content

&gt;When I commented that I wish there were new opponents

&gt;Very cool guy

 Have you been looking for a bad-ass build that melts damn commie ass like no other? Look no further than Liberty Prime! His face-melting prowess is unparalleled by any other build. Now let's get to the meat of the build.

-Hex Shield-
    You know who hides behind shields? Not you. You didn't choose an eight-foot tall ass-frying monstrosity to hide behind a wall like a little girl did you? Bitches hide behind shields. Don't be a bitch.

-Seige Pulse-
    There's nothing better than a big bad-ass gun that turns your enemies into little piles of gooey freedom. That's what this gun is. Freedom. You want to take radius

-Geth Turret-
    As a big wonderful hulking war machine, you don't need its shield help anyways. 

-Passives-
    You'll be using the Particle Rifle here

-Fitness-
    Go for more durability here. You melee is wonderful regardless

-Weapon-
    Particle Rifle is a must. The slow speed of the class means you can't be running around to ammo boxes all the time. With the extended magazine the continuous fire bonus of the Particle Rifle gets will be even better. That plus the barrel attachment of your choice and you've got a freedom-spewing monster.

   Any comments or advice will be appreciated

1338249224.0,u9gss,PSA About Spawning and Wave Budgets,ForTheWilliams,88,6,6,"Many of us already know this
--------------------------------
Many of us assume that waves work something like this:

- Each enemy type is set to spawn a certain number of times per wave. For example, 1 Atlas, and so on. Each enemy type also has a maximum number that can be on the field at any given time. 

This would mean that it is not a bad idea to kill the big baddies at every available opportunity


-------------------------

**However


The basic principles of spawning (not including spawn location mechanics

- **Each wave has a *wave budget

- 

- **Killing a certain unit type means that another *of that same unit* will spawn to takes its place.**

- 

- **In general, while Atlases only cost 100), and as such is not [directly] proportional to the danger of that unit, or the amount of health they have and how difficult they are to kill.**


In other words

Further,' to make sure that you deplete the wave budget as fast as possible and don't find yourself killing &gt;9000 Phantoms or something along those lines. 

Clearly

*However, but at least your strategy should be informed by these facts of spawning, one way or the other) 


-------------------------------

I'm not sure about the other factions, which (also IIRC) is actually nearly the same cost as a Phantom, and they are fairly easy to kill and also easy to avoid once they respawn. Keep killing them at every opportunity (just don't let yourself get swamped by neglecting everything else either) and you should eat up the budget rather quickly. Nemesis are also good candidates, as hard as they are to chase down sometimes, as they are among the lesser threats (they really just make it easier for -other-things to kill you and can usually be evaded) but are pretty expensive.


I hope this was news to some of you

Cheers.

*Batarian Soldier*

1. From the Trailer we can see they a sort of flechette punch. This could be a unique melee animation

2. The blog mentions nets and spiked weapons but I'm willing to bet this applies to the sentinel's stasis move and the new harpoon gun

3. His version of Adrenaline Rush/Marksmanship/Fortification is unknown.

EDIT: Playstation blog mentioned 'Blade Armor' as a soldier ability which would fit into the Bioware blog's description of Batarians as fighting with spiked armor. I'm guessing something very similar to Fortification.

4. His 'grenade' is also unknown.

*Geth Infiltrator*

1. Ostensibly has tactical cloak, probably taking cues from Geth Hunters.

2. They have an enhanced vision mode (as do the Geth Engineers) which spams triangles all over your screen but also highlights enemies through cover and walls (same effect as the Javelin scope

3. If they follow the theme of other infiltrators

*Geth Engineer*

1. Has a sentry turret, though, as we can see the rank 6 flamethrower. 

2. They have an enhanced vision mode (as do the Geth Infiltrators) which spams triangles all over your screen but also highlights enemies through cover and walls (same effect as the Javelin scope

3. Some sort of ground slam move which seems to give them a shield as they stay crouched on the ground and damages nearby enemies. Could actually be a heavy melee attack in the same vein as the Asari

EDIT: The recent blog on the Playstation site mentions Geth engineers having a shield recovery move. This could be the ground slam

*Batarian Sentinel* 

1. Has a unique version of stasis

2. Blog also mentions bludgeoning opponents with spiked armor at close range

3. He uses shockwave later in the trailer, and Net-thingy.

*Asari Justicar*

1. Large biotic bubble shield similar to the one seen during the final mission of Mass Effect 2. Ostensibly it will do a bit more than just keep bugs away in Multiplayer. If you pause it in the shot where she puts it up

2. The trailer later shows an Asari using pull

3. Their heavy melee appears to be the same as all other Asari.

4. The blog says they excel at hit and run tactics but it's difficult to know how that might apply to the game

*Krogan ~~Manguard~~ Vanguard*

1. First clip seems to show he shares the usual Krogan propensity for punching things in the face real nice like.

2. They don't really show him using any special abilities other than charge

EDIT: Playstation blog mentions one of his other abilities is Barrier.

3. Seriously though

**New Maps**

*Firebase Hydra*

&gt; Firebase Hydra – Firebase Hydra is located in an old abandoned Quarian colony which humans took over when they originally settled the world of Ontarom. It has since been converted into a massive dam facility which powers the communications hub located at Firebase Dagger and the kinetic barrier which protects it. Without this critical power source

1. Gameplaywise it seems to bring an interesting mix of indoor and outdoor combat

2.  Looks much more close quarters than Firebase Condor

*Firebase Condor*

&gt; Firebase Condor – A warzone outpost located on one of Palaven’s moons

1. If you played single player, with lots of elevation change in the form of conveniently waist high ledges.

2. The main difference is that there appears to be two larger

3. It's difficult to tell the size of this map because distinguishing the actual playing area from the background isn't easy during the zoomed out shots

4. Who comes up with these names?

**New Weapons**

*Striker Assault Rifle*

&gt;Krogan rifle with explosive rounds. Its rate of fire increases when the trigger is held.

1. This may be wishful thinking on my part but this seems to function very similarly to the original Falcon (ie: a fast firing AoE staggering monster). It fires much faster than even the pre-nerf Falcon

2. There doesn't appear to be any significant travel time or arc to the projectiles.

3. Depending on how you interpret the quote and video, but with a warm up time before reaching full potential).

4. Either way

5. Very very low capacity (six shots?) and high rate of fire means this weapon is going to spend almost as much time reloading as shooting.

*Geth Plasma SMG*

&gt; Fully-automatic geth submachine gun. Its rate of fire increases when the trigger is held.

1. Again

2. Probably a lighter weight

*Kishock Harpoon Gun*

&gt; Deadly one-shot batarian weapon. Causes bleed-out or disruption of target.

1. Seems like a sniper

2. However

3. Fires goddamn harpoons.

4. Unique melee animations show it being used almost as a sword. Maybe it has a built in melee damage bonus

1353348498.0,13gl1r,Three things that starting over from scratch has taught me.,fdelys,89,11,38,"Back in August my account was deleted.  Imagine you have every character (with all appearances), Bioware support was okay


* **1.  You are not as skilled as you think you are.**


Think months of sniping cannibals on Gold and Platinum and earning the most points makes you a friggin' awesome player?  Wrong.  Try that with a Mantis 1 and no equipment bonuses and limited medigel/missiles and get back to me.  

The correct combination of (leveled) weapon mods, you cannot play on Gold or Platinum without the proper equipment and weapons, unless you learn some alternate tactics (like I did).  Those follow.

* **2.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.**


In other words, they're almost always superior ways of playing.

I learned quickly that the Volus characters are among the best in mecoop because of how much they ensure the team's survival.  Pay attention to how you can help your teammates; don't just score whore the whole time.  I'd rather have an abysmal 10k points at the end of a gold match and get 80k credits than have the highest score on a game ending in wave 5.  Stick with your team.  If someone goes down, be smart about it.  Don't kill yourself to revive someone when it's wave 2 and there's a single enemy left.

* **3.  Synergize.  Everything.**


Beyond just generally working as a team, teammates, level, and enemy fit together.  Some levels are better for snipers than others.  Some are easier against the Geth for certain classes than others.  While it is fun to do unknown/unknown every now and then, it's far more effective to try and think how your characters and classes work on certain levels against certain enemies.  Can't snipe well on glacier?  Use hunter mode and bump up your armor piercing capabilities.  Biotic explosions work best in close quarters.  Ravagers are incredibly dangerous at distance, but not up close.  

Also work with a friend to create synergistic builds.  Don't try and set off every cryo explosion yourself; have one person use cryo blast and the other use shockwave.  


Anyway, uh, win.  So!  Enjoy, and keep on mecooping.

1338487798.0,ue7qy,Different races/classes are not the way to keep people playing multiplayer. Having missions recreate key moments in Mass Effect history is the way to go. ,OsecurityU,96,19,28,"Think of all your favorite moments in the Mass Effect games. Think of how differently you could replay those moments as different classes. Now think of how fun it would be to replay those moments as the class you want

I feel that a lot of people in this subreddit are focused on what new race/classes are coming out next. Personally

Basically

I think the best way these missions would work is to have about 20 minutes of running/gunning and objectives to do in previous Mass Effect area/map that are redesigned for multiplater. These would be much more linear and straightforward

My current idea for this kind of playing would be Virmire from ME1. Cut out the driving, you face Saren for a bit (think Kai Leng battle on Thessia) and then wait for evacuation while defending the bomb. 

The potential for this kind of game play is incredible. From Mass Effect 1: Contamination team dealing with rachni on Noveria, Shadow Broker infiltration/shock troopers. From Mass Effect 3:  Defending and activating defenses against the reapers. My personal favorite idea is this: defend a battalion of Elcor soldiers while they take out Reaperized Thresher Maws and Harvesters. 

I think that this new game play style would be a great way to draw new and old players back into the multiplayer without a huge focus on grinding for credits for new races/classes.

But most of my friends have stopped playing because the game was starting to get boring. So i've started playing a lot of pug matches and just trying to keep the game interesting.

Some people try speed runs

Personally i find the game gets too easy playing with a team thats too good. The game starts to become stale and more about getting equipment than the actual challenge and uniqueness of matches. Its almost a competition for points rather that just trying to survive. Playing with pugs reminds me more of how the game was meant to be and how it used to be when i first started playing. 

Thats why I LIKE playing pug matches. I even don't mind having to carry a team for a couple rounds because its a challenge and its just a part of the game for me. I understand that a lot of people don't play as much as i do and don't have the characters/equipment unlocked to play at the same level. But i don't kick those people from lobbies just for that

There is a limit of course, i like to give people a shot.

Rail Amp I or Headshot amp II. You realise they have a mic, triple, then quadruple their score. Bonus points if their last stand includes being surrounded by enemies and a call of ""I didn't want to waste my gels or missiles"" on the last target of a target elimination objective.

""The Blind Captain""

Horrifically under geared but queuing for Gold Collectors Condor. You question their choice of map

""The Inexplicable Retard""

A cool looking banner. A Harrier X. Optimal gear. Underscores you by a factor of 10. Bonus points if they're using a Turian Ghost and ruin each and every one of your biotic explosions before taking a Banshee arm to the chest.

""The Idiot Savant""

Their setup in the lobby is so questionable, on round one you're lagging behind them by 7000 points. This lead increases in multiples as each round is finished effortlessly. It's the easiest Collectors Condor Platinum run you ever did; sub-20 minutes and two survivor medals. Without a single word, as soon as you're back in the lobby they're gone. Bonus points if their N7 level is below 120. Bonus points if you have to go offline for a while to ponder on what actually happened.

* During Biotic Charge

* During the Nova animation

* If you are staggered by a melee, you will not be able to Charge or Nova until a quarter second after the animation wears off.

* **HOST THE GAME!** Vanguards are notoriously susceptible to lag and of course

* If possible Nova before charging. You’ll regain your shields anyways

* Holding back on your controller/keyboard after you Charge will take you out of melee strike distance so you will not get staggered before being able to drop a Nova

* Get to as close to 200% recharge as you can

* Avoid bosses with instant KOs. Seriously. Banshee Magnet Arms are not to be trifled with. And Phantoms will give you the skewer even while they are in the middle of their stagger animation. It sucks.
Now to the classes: here are three types of Human Vanguard to play, and Pewpew Laser Vanguard.



**[Pewpew Laser Vanguard](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#50LAKNR)** &lt;-- This is link to build

* This Vanguard is not very good on Gold runs, you’ll be ready to charge again. I recommend the Talon, Disciple, or Geth Plasma Shotgun/Graal Spike Thrower (which allows full power usage while the gun is charged). Aim for the head.



**[Biotic Murderspree Vanguard](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#50MAKOR)** &lt;-- This is link to build

* This Vanguard is here to smash and deal massive damage as fast as possible. This class involves careful timings. If you Nova directly after charging, you’ll have Charge off cooldown and be able smash into someone else. Alternatively you can Nova cancel by rolling directly after pressing Nova. This will make you invincible during the roll without dropping your shields, then just pop out of the roll and Nova. Your charge will be off cooldown when you are finished. If you noticed that I have chosen the Bonus Power as the 6th tier Biotic Charge talent. This is entirely up to you. Since you are going to be dropping a Nova after charging, having full shields when trying to deal as much damage as possible is kind of moot. Instead having the chance to immediately blast off another Charge can increase your damage output. I’ve gone back and forth with this but, in my humble opinion this is the better of the options if damage is your game. Feel free to increase your survivability if you like, these builds are just guidelines.



**[Tanking Vanguard](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#50RAQOR)** &lt;-- This is link to build

* This is the Vanguard I mostly play on Gold. It trades high damage output for threat control and exploitation of invincibility frames. Half Blast Nova and increased Radius is really your key for this build. The entire essence of this build is to attack as many groups of mobs as you can while setting off every tech burst and biotic explosion as possible. You do not have the power recharge bonus for this build, you’ll come out of the Charge as if you have already Nova-d, and will only get one before your shields drop. Then you’ll be sitting waiting for a recharge, and will probably die. I know, it’s happened to me a lot. Be patient and calm with your Nova timings. After your second Nova, Charge will be off cool down. As described above, you’ll be invincible during both Nova animations, even though you’ll be doing a lot of it. Survival and threat control win Gold games.

If you have any questions, feel free to send a message there as well. Good luck and happy hunting!",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,True,Cerberus,

",7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/zkbl7/what_you_didnt_know_about_overloadneural/,"After a bunch of testing I finally think I get how this power works.


**1.With Neural shock evolution Overload does twice as much damage vs organics**


As you might know Overload has this multipliers


&gt;Overload (Base against organics) (Armor=50%
&gt;
Overload (Base against robots) (Armor=100%


It also does 50% damage vs organic health and 100% vs synthetic health.


__________________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________

**Neural shock DOUBLES THE TOTAL DAMAGE  done vs organics. That is vs Health
_____________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________________________

This makes it an absolute must have
If you go for maximum single target damage you will be oneshotting the barriers of gold phantoms.
With consumables and gear even the barriers of a Platinum Phantom in one hit.

If you are worried that the neural shock effect will mess up their aim
Also only the main target falls

_______________________________________


2. Shield damage evolution gives you 100% damage bonus vs shields. That is not as good as it sounds.
All it does is change the multiplier vs shields from 300% to 400%.
But if you chose the other evolution you get a 15% damage increase


**So with Shield damage you get 407x 4 =&amp;nbsp; 1628
With the other evolution you get&amp;nbsp; 440 x 3 = 1320**


You get a small damage increase (308) on your main target


So unless you are doing a very specific widow/Javelin build and the shield damage gives you just enough to oneshot the shields

_______________________________________

3. Bounces to secondary targets work in a very weird and buggy way. The way I thing it works is this.


**The secondary bounce does 60% damage of the full damage


So it should do 374 first


When you cast overload I thing this happens:


If you are hitting health the game checks if you target is synthetic or organic and do you have the Neural shock evo
If it is synthetic it does not apply the damage penalty.


If you are hitting shields it applies the 300% or 400% damage multiplier.


**There is a chance that the game will fail the health check and it will do half damage to health


**However,even to geth.**


**So vs health is 374 first


**Vs shields the damage multiplier is applied on the first and second


**So vs shields 1122 first



The damage of the third bounce is so low that it becomes irrelevant(it would take 158 his from the third bounce to drop the shields of an atlas on gold) The only thing it does is stagger.

_______________________________________

With this in mind I recommend to chose damage on evolution 1


With this on a human engineer you get vs heath&amp;nbsp; 440 first, 792 on secondary target.


I wish the tooltips were more clear

Guys, today it feels like it is.

As I read our mission flavor text this week

As the months have passed, and as we’ve done so we’ve moved to higher difficulties: to Silver, to Gold, to Platinum. The fighting grows fiercer; the enemy has become more diverse. As the battle raged, lesser kits have fallen – the once great Turian Sentinel now all but replaced by his more powerful cousin, the Ghost; the god-tier kit of the demo era, the Asari Adept

Some of the old soldiers, but for the most part all that remains is the true elite, a final ragged band of strange but effective warriors – Krogans wielding hammers, self-repairing sexbots, the odd Falcon-punching Volus (???), and the chittering Vorcha in their barbaric battle-diapers. And who cares now for the Mantis sniper rifle? Whence the mighty Carnifex? All gone. In these final days it’s all the Lancer IX or nothing.

Well, anyway.

…

Somewhere, and pulls on a – what is that? – a blue on black leather tuxedo with pink tiger stripes and full frontal man-cleavage...it could only be a Drell! A Drell Adept, in fact. Once my go-to class for serious business, for whatever reason – maybe he has that lung disease thing, or maybe it was the three consecutive Banshee stomach impalements in that one match – my Drelldept has never even heard of a Reegar, much less used one. You said Volus have WHAT instead of a melee attack? And, most devastating of all…THEY PATCHED THE WUBWUB???

But check this out: I’ve got a Hurricane V

That’s right, I’m going Platinum. And I’m taking the wubwub with me.

…

On a personal note, and creativity have made this otherwise totally opaque and impenetrable game probably my most played of all time. For reasons I won’t get into, this has been the hardest, most hopeless, most difficult year of my life – and when nothing else, no book, no movie, would hold my interest, looks like in practice. Thanks.

So enough of that. ‘It’s been a hard

*Whether you want to improve your skills, soloing is a great way to do it.* 

*One big problem with learning how to solo is that when you watch videos of other players

*For most of you

*The goal of this guide is to explain why that is

*Because I can't simply explain everything

* [Interwebninja's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/) on how to transition to gold.

**Settings**
--

There are a couple of things that you can do to help yourself out. Sadly these only apply to pc users.

* **Field of view**

I highly recommend [increasing your fov.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14b1ek/guide_how_to_change_your_fov_pc_only_sorry/) I use 100. It helps a lot lot to be a little more aware of what's to your side.

Also if you are sitting close to a big monitor

* **De-tangling the omni-button**

social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11603699/

This is more important in team games than in solos (because of reviving)

I have to admit though that I personally haven't changed anything because I'm really lazy and don't want to learn new buttons. 

* **Controls**

I don't know anything about how to set up a controller (or if it is even possible to remap)

Remapping your keys is obviously relevant for team games as well
If you need a thermal pack

The most important thing is that you can reach all your buttons comfortably and comfortable can be very different for different people

I leave the powers on 1; 2 and 3. I have ops-packs on Q

My thermal packs are on 4.

If you have any extra mouse buttons

---

**Gameplay**
---

*Now let's get to the actual fun part. [Part 3 of interwebninja's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/c80rwp3) covers this very well so check that out first. But there are some things I want to expand on. (And some I want to reiterate for importance.)*

* **Right hand advantage**

Interwebninja explains this quite well, this is the only way to do damage to them without getting hammered yourself. 

* **Dodging**

Well, that means you can dodge almost everything if you react quick enough. 

The most notable ones are rocket-trooper missiles and banshee warp thingies. Both come with a warning sound and move slow enough to not require super human reflexes.

Dodge them either by doing your dodge (...) or by entering hard cover. Against banshee balls

It takes some practice of course

* **Movement**

Most enemies have pretty terrible aim against moving targets. So if you can't be in soft cover using right hand advantage

Never run straight away or straight towards enemies though

Don't stand still in the open

* **Kiting**

Most people probably know what this means, pyros, abominations, praetorians, dragoons) you want to always move backwards while shooting, so you stay out of range of their close range attacks.

This way you can kill them without ever giving them the chance to touch you. 

It's important to remain aware of what is behind you while you are doing that. 

* **Strafing**

Strafing while shooting is almost always a good idea

As long as you are moving sideways

* **Which enemies to kill first**

One of the more important decisions you have to constantly make is which targets to focus your fire on.

The big bosses are usually best left for last. The reason being that the bosses are worth relatively little in wave points. All of the big stuff is worth 100 points (praetorians are 120)

I don't know about you

It's best to kill the things first that are a) easy to kill; b) an immediate threat and c) worth a (relatively) large amount of wave points. 

Thing that are a first rate target in my opinion are hunters, ravagers and abominations. On some classes phantoms, brutes, scions are also good targets. 

Marauders, captains as well as the basic troopers are always decent targets, but in my opinion they are harder to kill in relation to their points than some of the above. They are also not as dangerous as most of them. 

---

**Awareness**
--

*Awareness is the single most important thing in a solo. The most common death reason in solos is something sneaking up behind you

*You have to do everything in your power to avoid getting surrounded

* **Counting enemies**

There are always eight enemies on the map. So

If you want to solo anything involving cerberus

Same goes for hunters if you are playing geth. 

* **Spawns**

Always memorize all the spawn points on a map. We have college posts for the different maps too and all spawn locations should be mentioned in those (hopefully).

At the beginning of a wave you want to block spawns, you only need to check one or two more spawns to know where the enemies are. 

Keep in mind that this is just personal preference and comfort. It isn't really important which spawns you block

Also you don't want enemies to spawn on both sides of you

In the middle of the wave

It can be hard to keep track of

Sadly on platinum this kind of goes out of the window again

* **Listening**

Most enemies make distinct sounds. In solos this is much easier to make use of because there aren't three teammates running around doing their thing. 

I recommend using headphones for this reason

* **Looking**

I try to look to the side everytime I reload. Additionally I usually try to do a 360 look whenever I switch cover.

Most of the time I do know where all enemies are (or at least where they are supposed to be) from observing spawns

And that's a damn good point. You see, a time we now refer to as the Great Infiltrator Cataclysm of the Post-Krysae Era.

And there's a reason for that son. Not too long after the game was released, the krysae. It flooded into every loadout, and soon infiltrators around the world had turned to the dark side, seeing no reason to use any other weapon. And it was true. There legitmately was no reason to use any other gun. The krysae could do it better, with less effort, and with an area of effect. I myself contributed to the catastrophe that would soon befall us.

So now that story time's over, it's back at full force and has most definitely stood the test of time. In my opinion, this is the absolute premier sniping build in the game right now. [**CHECK IT.**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#43RIMLDd7%400DE%40%40c4R4%400%400)

Some things to go over:

**What makes the black widow so good on this class?**

The rate of fire bonus from hunter mode allows you to get all three shots off with cloak bonus. This class's lack of a shield-stripping ability means that it's going to be markedly less effective against elite units with a single-shot rifle (unless, which I mean hey, best of luck to anyone who wants to try that). With the black widow, however, everything that isn't a boss dies in 2 shots or less. Let's give it a brief rundown:

*1 bodyshot/1 uncloaked headshot:* assault troopers

*1 headshot/2 bodyshots:* rocket troopers

*1 headshot/3 bodyshots:* dragoons

*2 bodyshots:* centurions, marauders, combat engineers (shield-stripping may require a headshot or two bodyshots with lower-level black widows against hunters and marauders, that's how it was pre-nerf with my BW IV)

*geth pyros:* 2 headshots

*phantoms:* headshot then a bodyshot or 3 bodyshots. Don't shoot them during a ninja flip. Hitting them with a prox mine will make them stand nice and still for you to line up a shot at their head.

As you can see, and brutes go down in 3 as long as one's a headshot. Once again, with a lower level BW, your results may vary.

**Sniper rifles are awkward at close range/I have a question about why you picked the (x) evolution on (x) skill:**

Both of these can probably be explained by the same thing. I am very aware of the popular melee build for geth infiltrator, the cloak melee upgrade, and 3 in fitness gives you enough damage to kill weaker enemies in a prox mine and 1 or two pulses. The reason I took power damage instead of headshot damage in the class passive is to give your prox mine enough damage to kill husks without bothering to melee. Here's another list for you of what enemies can be easily killed by your melee:

*prox mine*: husks

*prox mine, assault troopers, collector troopers, seeker swarms

*prox mine, centurions, combat engineers, marauders, collector captains

Anything stronger should be dealt with with your black widow, do not attempt to melee her unless her barriers are low. If they are, she'll go down in two pulses. If she's at full, run. You can also grab cover, pop off a bodyshot, wait for cooldown, cloak, prox mine

**WTF WALLHAX

What I imagine geth pyros say after I headshot them twice through a wall as our hero 1337n0sc0p3z420 responds with, armed combat to the geth is basically a video game. They control weapons platforms and respawn in a server hub after they ""die."" Anyways, this amazing new feature of the black widow comes from the addition of the illustrious new sniper mod, the high velocity barrel. Using both this and the old piercing mod on your black widow gives it javelin-like piercing ability. Combined with your hunter mode, most walls pose little to no obstruction to your ability to kill. In fact, the piercing damage reduction doesn't even seem to be enough to keep most of the shot combinations I listed above from killing. I like to go for headshots when shooting through walls just to be sure though. If your BW is at low level, the low spare ammo count may require you to hit up ammo boxes fairly frequently. At high level though, it's barely enough to pierce the thinnest cover. Back when I used extended barrel and spare ammo, even a lot of the thick boxes littered around a lot of the maps. Try it out

In summation, insane damage, ability to kill all non-boss enemies in a single cloak cycle. If you like sniping, look no further than this guy. Some prefer shotguns or assault rifles, but don't feel like those are the only options if you want to make a return to the roots of the infiltrator class.",,False,t5_2tkk1,True

1357873518.0,16cugx,ME3 Co-Op College- Races 101: The Base Human Kits,RepublicanShredder,70,7,79,"Because of Operation Genesis requiring the use of the basic Human Kits

From my experience

**Racial Passives and Traits**

Alliance Training and Fitness are the passives every base Human kit shares. They are quite balanced for racial passives and tend not to emphasize one aspect over another. I recommend putting points in Fitness for defenses over melee as I do not see Humans having enough melee or raw health to be a meleeing sort of race. 500/500 Health/Shields is not that much and it goes down quickly at close range.

Humans do possess the ability to do a combat roll, and the animation is quick. Once you master the combat roll, the Human gain a lot more survivability.

**Human Adept**

First off the list is one of the rarer kits you will see on the interwebs. The Human Adept (HA) is mainly a Biotic power user and has three solid powers to choose from. These powers are *Singularity

* The first one is Singularity

* The second power is Shockwave, the ability to hit two targets per cast, and the ability to go through walls, Shockwave is a hard hitting biotic power that can slam through enemies and is almost always a useful power. Keep in mind that Shockwave may bother other squadmates who wish to aim their guns and it has a limited range.

* And finally we have Warp. Warp is known to be a solid power to have for BEs

[Look on BBLoB for HA builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/145i1k/bblob_adept_characters/) and pick your favorite. There's some variety to choose from

**Human Soldier**

Of all the base Human kits, the HSol can deal ~260% of the base weapon damage. *Adrenaline Rush, Concussive Shot, and Frag Grenades* all mix very well with both weapons and Tech teams, which are common focuses in PUG MP squads.

* Adrenaline Rush allows for an instant reload of a weapon and ramps up weapon damage. It can also allow for tanking with the proper Rank 4 and 6 evolutions. That versatility rivals that of Tactical Cloak and is rarely skipped. It also makes guns with low damage/bullet like the Revenant and Claymore hit like a train.

* Concussive Shot (CS) tends to be dropped from a lot of players minds when they build a HSol, single detonator of Tech Explosions, which allows it to pair well with a [designated primer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1388bf/it_takes_two_to_tango_human_ingenuity/). The second is that CS can get past the 500N threshold for Platinum minions. This means that a CSs will either stagger a minion or force it to dodge, allowing for easy headshots. Finally CS has 4x damage multiplier vs Barriers, which is incredibly useful against Collectors, Banshees, and Phantoms.

* Last but not least

It's easy to observe the supremacy of the HSol by seeing how many [builds exist](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/145jcw/bblob_soldier_characters/) for it.

**Human Engineer**

Like the HSol, Combat Drone)* that can be strung together to make [many Fire Explosions (FEs) and Tech Bursts (TBs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1388bf/it_takes_two_to_tango_human_ingenuity/), much like how the HAs can string their powers for BEs. 

* The first power is Combat Drone. While it may seem weak at first, or something in between. It can qualify as the second best player in the game, after you of course.

* Now to Overload. This hitscan electrical power has a damage multiplier against Shields/Barriers and a damage penalty against organic Health. This penalty can be removed by taking the Rank 5 Neural Shock evolution. Overload can also be evolved to chain jump to another target

* The HE also has the inverse of Overload in the form of Incinerate. Effective against Armor and organic Health (by causing panic)

There are [several variations](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146di5/bblob_engineer_characters/) to choose from and all of them can support a team in their own way.

**Human Sentinel**

The Human Sentinel (HSent) is basically an honorary Biotic with a bit of tanking ability. *Tech Armor

* Tech Armor is an activated power that generates holographic armor around the user and can be detonated. When turned on, and a stat boost at Rank 5. When used while active, Tech Armor detonates to get rid of the bonuses and deals damage (and a strong force) over a small radius around the user. 

* As stated in the HA

* Throw is another solid Biotic power. It can detonate any Power Combo, further increasing its usefulness on any enemy.

[Like the Human Engineer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146l59/bblob_sentinel_characters/)

**Human Infiltrator**

Like the HA, Cryo Blast, Sticky Grenades*), but compared to other Infiltrators they appear lackluster. Combined however, these powers allow for massive burst damage.

* The first power is Tactical Cloak (TC)

~~The first is that attacking in TC will break the cloak 1 second after the attack is made

 The second is that in order to get true invisibility to the enemy

* The next power is Cryo Blast. An excellent debuffer against armor and movement slower by default

* Finally

Since I consider myself a master of [HI builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146ls3/bblob_infiltrator_characters/)

**Human Vanguard**

I'll be honest and say that I flat out suck with the Human Vanguard (HV) (or any Vanguard really) compared to the rest of the Human kits. I blame it on the fact that I don't enjoy using *Biotic Charge and Nova* and those don't mix well with the third power *Shockwave* at all. If you want a more in depth look at the HV

* So most Human Vanguards revolve around Novaguarding, Nova tends to be set at Half Blast (Rank 5) so that there can be two Novas in between Biotic Charges, which can restore 100% shields upon use (Rank 6).

* There is a useful technique called Nova-cancelling

[Check out BBLoB for HV builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146qdz/bblob_vanguard_characters/)

**Conclusion**

Hopefully that gives you the basic rundown on the base Human kits. The great thing about the base Humans is that they are available to everyone and they scale fairly well with weapon development. As a player gets better and better weapons

And if you think the aliens are better, ask an Asari. When you need a new problem, ask a Salarian. When you want a problem fixed, ask a Human.""",,False,self,1357927609.0,t3_16cugx

**Introduction**

So you want to take on Platinum? A noble goal indeed. Conquering the hardest difficulty available is quite an accomplishment and I am here to help. This guide does not guarantee perfect play and guaranteed extractions

So this guide is going to be divided into three parts. The first part is *Pregame Knowledge*, build checks, and a bit of social interaction. The second part is *Lobby Knowledge*, where I will discuss everything that you can change in the lobby, including enemy and map compositions, kit considerations with regards to others, and Power Combos. The final part is *Ingame Knowledge*, which have video evidence to back them up. To prevent confusion

Before you read this post

___________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

**Pregame Knowledge**

So first off, 4 players can block spawns so that all the enemies spawn in Glacier's basement. Nuke spawns with missiles except for objective waves. Repeat every 10 minutes until you have [LOADSAMONEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-7v4qnHP8). Now you know how to play Platinum for credits. Google it if you have any more questions.

Now if you want to play Platinum for fun and for a challenge

Anyways


* *Desire for challenge*- As stated beforehand

* *Maxed out Rares/have access to all URs*- Now I don't expect you to have every Rare at X nor access to every UR

* *Spare high level equipment*- It's the hardest difficulty, though my massive surplus helps with that. Consider spending money on Spectre Packs to boost your high level equipment stores.

* *Clearing Gold with relative ease*- Related to the first point

* *Solid, as having a dependable teammate halves the difficulty of Platinum thanks to how different kits can interact (more on that later).

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Builds**

Now for builds. How you spec out a kit can drastically change the effectiveness of said kit. So like many games, *DPS*, and *Support*. Granted, there is some overlap (e.g.- DPS can overshadow the need to Tank and Support can enhance DPS) but each aspect can fall under those three categories. *Special Tricks* for each kit can round out these three aspects.


* *Tanking*- This revolves around how well can you resist damage. Things that help include speed, and the ability to evade damage such as dodging and dropping aggro (Tactical Cloak and [pets](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/182ehk/mecoop_college_609_powers_drones_and_turrets_and/)).One aspect of tanking that isn't mentioned too often is stagger resistance. Pre-Retaliation Batarians and Krogans as well as the N7 Destroyer (especially with Devastator Mode) and Geth Juggernaut have heightened stagger resistance, making them perfect for tasks that require them to stay out in enemy fire such as ramp-up weapons and close range combat with tough minions like Dragoons and Hunters. Overall, tanking is the one aspect most easily supplemented by smart gameplay such as the [Right Hand Advantage](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19lh02/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_right_hand/), flanking, and hugging cover. 

In the case of the VS

In the case of the BHS

* *DPS*- The meat of Platinum gameplay is slaying bad guys before than can hurt you. Some kits have extreme power damage (like the [Geth Trooper](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/GethTrooper/LKHIF/Acolyte10BP5BK5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule4/OmniCapacitors5/) and others can combo their way to victory (like an [N7 Paladin](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/NPaladin/GKQDR/Hurricane10AV5BC5//SMGRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule4/OmniCapacitors5/)), Reegar, and Piranha or sniper rifles like the Javelin, Black Widow, and CSR are capable of dropping immense burst damage that is unparallelled. One must consider how their kit will do DPS-wise against all defenses, with Armor being the most important. Ammo powers should compensate a weapons/kits weakness against certain defenses, such as Phasic Rounds for a kit that is great against Armor (like the VS) or Incendiary Rounds for a kit that is great against Shields/Barriers (like the Turian Ghost with his TC-boosted Overload).

In the case of the VS, does great damage against all enemies and absolutely chews through Armor. Flamer can also take advantage of the Incendiary Rounds bug to deal even more damage. 

In the case of the BHS

Now back to the DPS portion, I could deal with boss and Phantom Barriers much more easily, but I wanted to down boss armor much quicker so I chose the SMG Rail Amp. To complement the amped up Hurricane, Warp + Throw can formed supercharged Biotic Explosions to finish off enemies. And when I mean supercharged, I mean it's one of the best around, dealing ~6,000 damage per explosion on Armor and Barriers.

* *Support*- While vague, and healing are all forms of support players can use game. Debuffs help the most as there are many bosses on Platinum that benefit from being debuffed and they directly contribute to DPS. Distractions force enemies to switch targets, buying precious time to aid a teammate or to open up an attack of opportunity. It's much easier to shoot when no one is shooting you. Finally, healing keeps teammates alive means they can deal damage. This type of support has a caveat as the ""lost"" time spent healing should be made up by damage output. Staying alive means nothing unless you are dealing damage to the enemy. Looking at you, Mr. Scrubbernaut.

In the case of the VS, preventing them from firing back (Marauders in particular). 

In the case of the BHS, Tech Armor can be detonated to stagger enemies, even through walls. 

Both of these kits aren't great examples of support


* *Special Tricks and Tactics*- Finally, and interesting power interactions all fall under this category. For example, if you have Marksman or Adrenaline Rush active Seeker Swarms/Plagues will not affect your cooldowns. Another example is adding Phasic Rounds III to a Javelin X, which allows for a single bodyshot to kill most minions. In fact, I encourage you to look through both videos in their entirety and try to find as many tricks as possible. You could put them in the comments as a form of mental exercise. A thorough understanding of one's kit drastically improves the effectiveness of said kit.

In the case of the VS

In the case of the BHS, but I am satisfied with the current setup's extra punch against boss Armor. You will also notice that I use Throw a lot as it has a quick cooldown, can detonate all Power Combos (including both of the Huntress powers), and can stagger all non-bosses. Finally, I can use Tech Armor to get that last bit of damage to [stagger and finish off enemies near me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Mix8kv_bY#t=19m50s).

You can see my current build [here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#16NPANRl1q2OBMPQ4R4L4N4).

So I've been doing a lot of random pubs on Gold as well as FBWGG runs with this guy, but as soon as he hits 20 I'm going to try him in some Platinum runs and see if he can really be solid.


**How it Works**
WIth this build you are playing a beefy, you never have to pause to launch multi-frag grenades. You also don't need to go snatch up grenades to refill your stockpile, leaving them all for the Demolishers who are showing up in just about every gold game nowadays.

Need to switch into Terminator Mode to tank a capture or make a revive? Just turn off the Missile Launcher and you're suddenly as beefy as the other guys are. After you get back into position

The only thing you lose


**Why do It**
The Missile Launcher actually does a lot of things that I like. When building this guy

* Turn the corner into a Pyro? Missile Fires and you run away while they stagger.
* Pop a Medi-Gel at the feet of a Banshee/Phantom? Missile Fires and you don't get res-killed.
* Hunter sneaks up on you while you're scoped? Missile Fires and you swap to a Piranha to melt their face.

It also helps with shield gating. While using a 3-round sniper rifle in Devastator Mode


**The Trick**
The trick to maximizing the Missile Launcher is to never actually enter cover. The Missile doesn't fire while you are up against the wall or ducking. You need to stay out of cover, and if things get harry I can duck into cover with a 30% shield recharge cooldown. If a Prime is coming up, I just take cover and empty a Piranha or Typhoon into him, and the missile finishes cool down while I'm reloading.

**Cerberus Anti-Specialist Forces Handbook**

**Intro:**

Congratulations on being accepted into Cerberus' elite combat teams. Your enhancements haven't killed you

We here at Cerberus have continually fought hard on various planets

Our intelligence have established that the Alliance Military have formed specialized ops groups to invade and hold important stations. They operate in teams of no more than 4

We have compiled a list of these specialized soldiers, Red (Most Skilled), and finally Black, a colour we reserve for enemy soldiers that have the capacity to take down entire detachments by themselves.

*Please note that this handbook is required reading for all Centurion-class

***CHAPTER 1: ADEPTS***

* Code-name for biotic operatives

**Human (Class-A)** *Rank: Red*

Identified by their goggle-like helmet, lifting you or panicking you before you even engage your target. The abilities they employ are all visible upon firing, so combat rolls are highly effective to dissipate their effectiveness. Avoid the Singularities they set up, as well as any comrade who has been hit by their Warp, due to a possible incoming Biotic Explosion. 

Focused fire on this Adept often forces them into cover

*Phantom-class specialists have been issued with hexagonal disruption shielding that will block these abilities. Phantoms are warned to watch the shield generator's temperature

**Asari (Class A)** *Rank: Red*

The asari have used biotics since before we've known them, either rending their armour nigh-useless to incoming fire or extending the Stasis to include the trooper's allies. Dragoon-class units, as well as Atlas Infantry Fighting Exoskeleton, have found to be immune to Stasis' effect, due to the armour's hydraulics. The also use Warps much like the human Class-A Adept, but combine it with the usually ineffective Throw. By itself, Throw can toss an unshielded soldier with a huge blow, decimating groups of Cerberus soldiers.

As with many Adepts

**Drell** *Rank: Red*

These Adepts arrive onto the battlefield with similar strategies to what you've seen. Their 'Pull"" works similar to a reverse-Throw

These drell, invisible upon use, as well as being able to be used on multiple operatives and on individuals repeatedly, have caused Reave to be known as a slow killshot to those who have faced it. Not only can it eat through Atlas armour in seconds, but it greatly increases the lethality of Pull and the drell's grenades. Reave is able to detonate Biotic Explosions on Pull, and be detonated by Cluster Grenades.

If you are fortunate enough to be warned of a drell Adept of the battlefield

* Soldiers deployed with the Polycrystalline-Composite ""Guardian"" Tactical Shield are warned to never engage a drell Adept. The shield has not been proven to block Reave

**Asari (Class B)** *Rank: Red*

Engaged similar to a drell Adept

These operatives have another trick up their sleeve, such as Phantom- and Dragoon-class units, must be warned that some Biotic Spheres have a deadly Warp-like affect that drastically reduces armour's protection and sets up deadly Biotic Explosions.

Smoke grenades as well as fragmentation grenades are very useful to get the asari to leave her protective bubble

**Cerberus Phoenix Traitor** *Rank: Red-Priority*

Unfortunately, when they did not. 

Training skirmishes with Dragoon-class allies have shown us effective tactics to engaging Phoenix Traitors. Stay far away

They are not enemies to be laughed at

Proving that there's no depth to which these back-stabbers will sink, leaving them open for further attacks, Lash means to kill or incapacitate the enemy with the attack itself. Lash stumbles Atlases, and can send anyone else into a wall at bone-breaking speeds. Somehow, they have even developed a way to penetrate our shielding technology, as well as barriers, in order for most of Lash's force to be applied to the body as well. Phantom-class units have been issued extra fuel for their jet-propelled movement systems to help recover from Lash.

Forces are ordered to take as many Phoenix Traitors alive as possible. These deserters are not a lost hope. Further enhancements can be issued to return them to Cerberus

**Human (Class B)** *Rank: Black*

Class-B human Adepts (dubbing themselves 'Furies') have been honing their biotic talents for decades. Ceberus intelligence have yet to infiltrate and learn anything about the training they received at the Interplanetary Combatives Academy in Rio de Janerio, they have unlocked the secret to minor teleportation, showing it with this specialized soldier as well as the Class-B human Vanguard known as 'Slayers' and the turian Cabal Vanguard. 

Battlefield vids have shown that these Adepts emit a field that applies a biotic effect on any adversary within a given radius. This effect is often detonated in succession by a rapid flurry of Throws.

Human Class-B Adepts have also learned a puzzling technique that some have called 'Dark Channel'. Intelligence has reported that this technique was discovered by the Collectors

Origin aside, quick, deadly and able to be detonated. The differences are that it's unstable enough that one Adept cannot apply Dark Channel to multiple targets and that it does not cease upon death. Once Dark Channel kills its target, it 'jumps' to the next nearest target, reapplying its deadly effect. Soldiers have been known to panic and desert allies as soon as Dark Channel covers them. The combined effects of Channel as well as the mysterious aura that surrounds the Fury Adept has been known to kill a Dragoon-class unit in seconds.

Engaging this target has proved to be extremely difficult to all except the most sure-shot Nemesis-ranked sharpshooters. Do not engage in close-quarters, and retreat when your Centurion officer orders to you. ",[Story Time],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1376342413.0,Xbox,

I thought I would write a quick post with some tips on the Talon Engineer. I think the team underestimated how much of a niche character this guy is

**Overview**

The Omni-Bow is considered a melee ability, the melee portion of your bow damage always exceeds the power portion of your bow damage, so you should maximize melee damage bonuses and then fill with power damage bonuses.

**1) Maximize melee damage bonuses**

To maximize bow damage

- Take ranks 4a
- Use an Omni-Blade or any other melee mods on your weapon. Due to the way the math works on these mods (they add a multiplicative damage bonus after all other bonuses)
- Use the Hydraulic Joints or other melee damage bonus gear if you can afford not taking grenade gear
- Use a Strength Enhancer consumable

**2) After melee damage

- Take ranks 4b and 5a in your Elite Mercenary passive power to maximize power damage bonuses
- Take a Power Amplifier consumable since there is no melee damage bonus in this category

**3) Bow Powers**

- The bow damage by itself isn’t huge
- Keep activating bow powers as you consume charges to ensure you always have power charges when you fire your bow. The number of charges is displayed as arrows attached to your character’s right shoulder.
- To maximize bow damage
- Take rank 6a

**4) Use heavy melee to get all arrows to hit the same target**

The bow has 2 firing modes. If you tap the melee button

**5) Locking onto targets**

The bow has a lock-on mechanic that uses the same targeting as powers to determine who it will hit. To hit targets

**Conclusion**

The team is keeping a close eye on the Talon Engineer to make sure he is a viable kit at all difficulty levels. We do have some ideas for changes to make him easier to use,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,Cerberus,t3_19gk5l
1359109489.0,178zwt,ME Co-Op College 408:  Store,InterwebNinja,73,11,46,"####OVERVIEW

This guide covers the known and speculated mechanics of the Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer Store.  Rather than a detailed breakdown of each pack type, or through data collected from users in this subreddit.  There is a degree of uncertainty on some numbers - the guide will disclose when that is the case.  Finally, the guide covers some suggested buying strategies and tips.

For clarity and brevity, Jumbo Equipment Packs (JEPs), Spectre Packs (SPs), Premium Spectre Packs (PSPs), Arsenal Packs, (APs), and Reserve Packs (ResPs).  *'Consumables'* refers to Rockets, Ops Packs, or Gear, Ultra-Rare is abbreviated to 'UR'.

####PACKS

Each pack has five slots, the first slot of every pack is dedicated to unlocking consumables (or equipment when consumables are maxed), and the last slot of every non-JEP is dedicated to items or equipment.

The following table shows the cost and content of each of the packs.

Pack|Cost|# of Consumable Slots|Quantity of Consumable|# of Item Slots|Default Item Rarity|# of Equipment / Other Slots|Equipment Level
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
RP|5000|2|1|1|Common|2|I
VP|20000|2|3|1|Uncommon|2|II
JEP|33000|4|5|0|n/a|6|I to III
SP|60000|1|5|1|Rare|3|III
PSP|99000|1|5|2|Rare|3|III
AP|99000|1|5|2|Rare|3|III
ResP|99000|1|5|2|Rare|3|III

There are some exceptions to the equipment levels

####CONSUMABLES

The following table shows the expected number of consumables earned from each pack type

Pack|# of Consumables
:---|:--:
RP|400
VP|300
JEP|600+
SP|83
PSP / AP / ResP|50

Lower-tier packs unlock consuambles at much higher rates.  In particular, and ResPs.  If you're low on medigel or rockets and you are desperate for a quick boost of consumables, consider some of the lower-tier packs.  JEPs obviously offer the best value, but for other reasons (covered below), you may want to choose another pack like a VP.

Note, JEPs offer by far the best value for consumables alone.

####EQUIPMENT

The middle slots of packs most often produce equipment, if you have maxed your Uncommon weapons, the right-most slot in a VP will usually give you level III equipment instead (the other two middle slots will usually give you level II equipment).  Likewise, in an SP or PSP, the item slots will give you level IV equipment if you have maxed your Rare weapons and characters (unless you get an UR weapon).

The following table shows the expected number of drops of each equipment level

Pack|Level I|Level II|Level III|Level IV
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
RP|400|?|0|0
VP|0|100-|low?|lower / possible?
VP w/Maxed Uncommon Items|0|100|50|lower / possible?
JEP|60|60|50|0
SP|0|0|50-|&lt;1
SP w/Maxed Rare Items|0|0|50-|17
PSP / AP / ResP|0|0|20-|&lt;1
PSP / AP / ResP w/Maxed Rare Items|0|0|20-|20

The '-' symbols in the table account for items that will drop in place of equipment.  Generally speaking, and they appear to hit each pack roughly proportionately.  So, while the numbers in the table may not be accurate in these cases, the relative value in the packs should be roughly correct.  A '50' has more value than a '50-', which means that VPs are technically the best pack for maximizing level III equipment once you have maxed your Uncommon items.
 
Notable takeaways from this analysis are that level III equipment drops at nearly equal rates in VPs, especially for players with maxed Rare manifests.  An SP for a character with a maxed Rare manifest will unlock level III+ equipment 33% faster in SPs than in the more expensive packs.  Still, a VP with a maxed Uncommon / Rare manifest will gain more than double the volume equipment (2/3 of which will be level II), when compared to SPs.

####ITEMS

The table below shows the expected number of item drops per million credits spent.  URs have been skipped for this analysis

Pack|Uncommon Mods|Uncommon Gear|Rare Weapons|Rare Characters|Rare Weapon Mods|Rare Gear
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
VP|2.0|8.0|low|low|low|low
SP|3.9\*|1.4\*|6.8|4.7|4.1|3.8
PSP|?|?|6.7|4.7|4.0|4.2
AP|3.3\*|1.9\*|12.1|low|1.3|5.0
ResP|low|low|low|13.3|low|5.2

\* Small sample size

The conclusion here is that for any Rare item, the two packs will offer nearly identical value for Rare Items.  Given the benefits of extra equipment and consumables from SPs, they may offer a better overall value.

VPs are by far the best value for Uncommon Gear, offer a better value for Uncommon Mods.  It's advisable to mix in some SPs early on to help unlock these Mods.

Arsenal Packs are an intriguing option for someone leveling up their manifest - you can make progress on Uncommon Items at a decent rate while leveling up your Rare Weapons and Gear.  Unfortunately, the yield on consumables is very low.

####ULTRA-RARES

This is the topic that is of most interest to many people, for a number of reasons.  First of all, there is nearly incontrovertible statistical evidence that the UR weapon drop rates can change.  Data collected on day-of-DLC has shown drop rates doubling for UR weapons in PSPs, APs, and ResPs.  Secondly, obtaining estimates of low-probability events is much more difficult than for high-probability ones.

That said, APs, and ResPs.  Given the cost of SPs is higher, these estimates project that you will unlock URs about 18% faster with the 99000 credit packs.

You should take these numbers with a grain of salt, and there has never been evidence that the UR drop rate has changed in them.  For the other packs, it is very possible that numbers reported have been biased by day-of-DLC effects.  If the true rate for the 99000 credit packs is somewhere closer to 12-13%, (as has been measured in the past for PSPs), then SPs and PSPs would have no difference in value for URs.

Note

####MISCELLANEOUS

* If your goal is to unlock more equipment

* Each piece of equipment has a maximum value of 255.  If you go beyond that when buying packs

* Anecdotally

* Upgrades to your consumable capacity can be unlocked through VPs and up.  There isn't enough data to recommend which packs are most efficient for doing this (though it is likely that SPs and higher are best

* ResPs unlock Common Character cards 50% of the time in one of the equipment slots.  This is effectively 100000 wasted credits for each million spent on ResPs.

* Among SPs, and APs, the latter is the only pack not to unlock Common Character cards.  Thus, for someone with a maxed Rare manifest looking to maximize their UR chances, APs may be the best value.


####CONCLUSIONS

People frequently ask about spending strategy in the store, as many of the Weapon Mods in those will be useful later on.  As a next step, maxing your Uncommon Weapons through VPs will substantially increase the value of those packs, since level III equipment will begin unlocking instead of weapons.  This equipment will be critical when moving up in difficulties.

That said, try APs.  For new characters, try ResPs.  Or, for a mix of equipment and characters / weapons / mods, stick with SPs or PSPs.  The most effective buying strategies will involve keeping your supply of consumables and equipment at a decent level, while unlocking new characters / weapons for the sake of fun.  A mix of packs will accomplish this.

***End Note:***  I'm still happy to accept data from anybody willing to collect it.  Just send me a private message with your unlock rates.

The idea is that there would be multiple versions of each enemy faction (Geth/Cerberus/Reaper), or spawn in different numbers. Make up a little bit of background on each army to give it some flavor, and serve.

The benefit of this would be some added variety: A common request among ME3 Co-op players who are starting to cool off on fighting the same enemies each time. This would vary the bad guys a little bit: You might spec a particular soldier build to take on the high number of Atlases that one Cerberus army employs. You might find it's riskier to blindly randomize your enemies because not all your characters are equipped to take on Ravagers with shields.

Here's some examples. Some are just ""More of X in a wave, and so might be too much work to accomplish.

*Absolution Legion*

* This Reaper force is commanded by Harbinger itself. Absolution's numbers seem to be limitless
* Faction: Reaper
* Traits: Fewer ""elite"" units per wave

*Ascension Legion*

* A new Reaper named Judicator commands this attack force
* Faction: Reaper
* Traits: All enemies have 20% more health/shields/armor/barrier. Banshee teleportation range is increased.

*Hephaestus Cell*

* This Cerberus task force is an elite assault unit that takes on assignments from the Illusive Man himself.
* Traits: More centurions and guardians. Fewer phantoms. Enemies shoot incendiary ammo.

*Thanatos Cell*

* This assassination cell is led by Kai Leng. It is responsible for eliminating several key leaders of the Alliance.
* Faction: Cerberus
* Traits: More phantoms! More nemeses.

*Zeta Wing*

* Faction: Geth
* Traits: No geth troopers. Instead

*Alpha Wing*

* Faction: Geth
* Traits: Geth rocket troopers and primes can [boost](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Tactical_Armor#Shield_Boost) shields. Geth primes wield spitfires instead of shotguns.

*Theta Wing*

* This geth consensus has fully joined forces with the Reapers
* Faction: Geth
* Traits: Small numbers of Reaper units spawn in this army.",self,t5_2tkk1,1339617211.0,,Cerberus,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/v0959/idea_for_new_enemies_split_each_faction_into/

Now that that's out of the way

Their health is piss poor, in addition to those of any nearby allies.  They have a roll, which is as useful as rolls tend to be.  Their heavy melee creates a bubble shield, which appears to stop enemy fire.  You can't leave the shield standing, though; once you end the melee, it goes away.

The engineer's unique power is tactical mine, revealing enemies ala hunter mode.

The adept gets biotic orbs.  These appear to buff your cooldowns when they're out, you can chuck them at your enemies as soon as you cast it, making it hands down the most potent biotic attack in the game (in terms of raw damage).  Also, one of the final evolutions offers an enemy debuff (15% damage increase, all sources.  Stacks with each orb hit).  In a nutshell, they're awesome!

Here's what makes all the difference: Devastator Mode.  No other class offers such a perfect solution to the biggest drawbacks of the PR.  A short refresher on DM's abilities

One

Another thing DM does?  Added ammo.  The advantage of that for *any* weapon is apparent

Okay, because the PR builds up its beam based on consecutive shots fired, spitting them out as fast as possible is obviously the way to roll if you want to deal your damage faster.  Drawback:  you run out of ammo faster, duh.  That's *not good* for the PR. That will be addressed in a bit.

You have a base RoF and ammo increase from DM

Now

*WHAAAAAAAAT?*

YES!  Spit all the ammo out of that bitch, you don't?  Are you retarded or something?  Turn it on!  Now, see that nice fat ammo increase?  Burn it up.  Unleash that shit into the face of the nearest unlucky son of a bitch, bukkake style.  Using up all the ammo requires a ~5 second cooldown animation on top of waiting for your ammo to recharge, right?  WRONG!  Turn off DM!  Now turn it back on!

BAM! RELOADED!

""But Jockey

*FOOL!* What is your build!? You don't need anything but the PR! 

I am built entirely for weapon damage (no weight bonuses), then reload cancel with DM, I end up with ~3/4 of that *immediately*, and it's at full recharge speed, meaning I have full ammo a small fraction of a second after that. 

This character eats through Gold like my fat ass through a bowl of grits.  AP and extended mag mods, and Cyclonic Modulator for extra time in the line of fire.  Whatever Ammo Bonus you take will be applied quickly and often, even moreso due to DM's RoF.  For that reason, I choose Incendiary Ammo. Depending on the Ammo's rank, I can stop firing on a Boss with as much as two bars of armor/health left and let the stacked burning do the rest.  Don't try it at first, you'll get yourself killed.  Actually, don't try it at all.  It's my tactic. *Mine.*

**TL;DR: DM makes that shit approximately forty-seven fofillion times better

Totally not an edit - Oh yeah

Totally an edit - Well, there aren't any mods to increase your RoF, but there *are* mods to increase your ammo.  Double-Also, my Destroyer isn't built for this weapon; this weapon just happened to fit it perfectly.  Still, your choice may vary, especially with this new info.

Totally another edit - Holy shit, I'm afraid :/

Even with the incredible amount of depth that the class system brings to ME3CoOP, but even with a Gold viable super-class, it's still the same damn game against the same damn three sets of enemies. Sure, those with maxed out rares can squeeze a little more enjoyment out of mixing and matching high-level weapons with classes, but meanwhile the mid-level players are stuck grinding Silver over and over and over again. It just doesn't seem like a sustainable formula to me. It's lasted for a long time, much longer than I expected, and Bioware should be commended for that.

My idea is to provide a strong additional incentive for players to keep levelling: make N7 guns more common for those with higher N7 ranks. 

Maybe I'm alone in thinking that the N7 guns are just far too rare and should be made more common, and so on. No inbetween increases, only at every 50th level.

Tactical Cloak: Duration

Electric Slash: Edit: Damage

Shadow Strike: Damage

N7 Shadow: Power Damage/Capacity (just for the capacity)

Sword Mastery: Sword Damage, because the only armored targets are atlases, which I can barely hurt anyway, meanwhile almost everything is shielded and I can't one hit kill a few things, but having shield effectiveness allows me to. I know the flaming sword is cool and all, but the electro sword is much more effective.

I also took rank 5 of N7 Shadow and put it into rank 4 electric slash because of [this fine gentleman's inquiry](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/wqh6v/very_effective_n7_shadow_build_that_ive_been/c5fpdgn)

__________________________________________________________

So what you're probably thinking is ""why the hell would you choose duration over damage"", you would get one cloak cycle with 140% damage (assuming martial artist is active), also leaving yourself completely vulnerable afterwards. With duration, you can cloak and shadow strike and still have at least 5 seconds of cloak remaining, which you can use to get a 100% damage bonus (w/ martial artist) or finish off anyone with a heavy melee that will also do 100% extra. Most mooks, including phantoms will die after one cloaked shadow strike along with the electrical damage afterwards, thus the 40% damage bonus is redundant. 

Another thing is if you do what I did and don't evolve electrical slash, and standing next to a turret yields bad times, but if I cloak&gt;electric slash&gt;shadow strike it will kill it straight up.

1365892396.0,1cakqa,Why You Should Care For: The M-76 Revenant,RepublicanShredder,61,6,42,"This gun has had a hard time transitioning from Mass Effect 2 to Mass Effect 3. Originally a weapon only accessible to Soldiers

Personally, and has a great rate of fire that gives me a bit of guilty pleasure when using it.

_________________________

*Why do players not like the Revenant in ME3?*

**I wanted Quality, thus forcing the player down a narrow route of choice in order to continue using the Revenant. In particular, the accuracy is what turns many players away as most assault rifles have *very* good accuracy at range.

**Once again, putting the user at a bigger risk than most guns.

**No running and gunning allowed**- Whilst firing the Revenant

**And there's the Harrier...**- Like any assault rifle

_______________________________________________

*With those issues

**DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA**- One of the great features of the Revenant is it's high rate of fire and magazine size. Those two combined allow for the Revenant to deal an enormous amount of damage for a sustained and burst period. Whilst only being out-DPSed by UR ARs and a Mattock with a macro

**It's general stats are pretty good**- You don't need laser-like accuracy unless you are sniping across the map. Once the stability issue of the Revenant is locked down, the Revenant has a great ammo capacity in both its magazine and spare ammo (unlike a certain bird-named UR assault rifle), easing the need for extraordinary ammo management. Finally, the Revenant is also of medium weight and thus doesn't kill power recharge times unlike the heavier assault rifles. This makes the Revenant a perfect fit for Soldiers who want to have both high firepower and great cooldowns in one package.

**Easy to use**- There's no trick you have to use with this gun. It's basically a bullet hose. No need to use soft cover for a charge up

____________________________________________

*Miscellaneous*

**HOT MODS AND EQUIPMENT!**- There's a variety of modifications for this gun to improve its effectiveness. Personally, I highly recommend AP Ammo above all else. With AP Ammo, armor damage reduction (the biggest bane of the Revenant) becomes a non-issue and the ability to penetrate cover will only make it that much better when you want to use soft cover. If AP isn't available, high level Drill Rounds provide an acceptable substitute. If neither of those are around, make sure you have an armor penetration mod on board and choose Incendiary Rounds for additional armor damage.

**Accuracy++ = Tanking++ = Cover++ = Killing++**- To get the absolute best out of the Revenant, consider using [hard cover to improve your accuracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18xora/an_acute_observation_cover_and_accuracyrecoil/). It's a noticeable change between being in cover and not in cover.

**And it sounds cool too!**- The Revenant also has a really cool firing sound. I thought I should point that out. I should also point out that the Revenant looks cool too

_______________________________

And that's why you should use the M-76 Revenant. It's a powerful light machine gun that has a few big issues with it. Fortunately, if any, equals. Any equals must sacrifice something, such as the Harrier with its ammo capacity and the Typhoon/PPR with the windup time, in order to be competitive with the Revenant. Players looking for a no-BS machine gun should look towards the Revenant to provide them a solution to their woes.",[Weapon Discussion],False,t5_2tkk1,True
1365637075.0,1c3kjy,Why You Should Care For: The Uncommon Weapons Pool,RepublicanShredder,69,12,58,"I guess people love having access to the best weapons. This is obvious for those who complain that they don't have the Harrier, they shouldn't get as much crap as they do. [Especially the Raptor](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1ae4hi/why_you_should_care_for_the_m13_raptor/)

_______________________________________
*Why do people whine about the Uncommons?*

**BUT I HAVE THEIR SUPER DAMAGING BROTHER**- Each Uncommon weapon has a Rare/Ultra-Rare equivalent. I put them in this table to see how it works. Players may dismiss the Uncommon weapon because their counterpart tends to be much stronger in terms of damage. Can't fault them for that as most of the Uncommons have quite a low damage/pellet stat.

Weapon Type|Uncommon Variant | Rare/UR Counterpart
|:-|:-|:-
Accurate Burst Assault Rifle | Vindicator | N7 Valkyrie
Heavy Assault Rifle | Mattock | Cerberus Harrier
Balanced Assault Rifle | Phaeston | M-76 Revenant or Collector Assault Rifle
Light Pistol | Phalanx | M-11 Suppressor or N7 Eagle
Rapid Fire Shotgun | Scimitar | N7 Piranha 
High Powered Accurate Shotgun | M-22 Eviscerator | M-11 Wraith 
Bullet Hose SMG | M-9 Tempest | N7 Hurricane
High Accuracy SMG | M-12 Locust | M-25 Hornet or Collector SMG
Light Multi-shot Sniper Rifle | M-97 Viper | N7 Valiant
Hybrid Sniper Rifle | M-13 Raptor | Collector Sniper Rifle
High RoF Sniper Rifle | M-29 Incisor | M-90 Indra

**THIS GUN IS BAD AND IT SHOULD FEEL BAD**- Two Uncommon weapons


______________________________________
*And why should I still use the Uncommons?*

**Featherweights**- With the exception of the Incisor, a high-powered assault rifle. The Tempest is significantly lighter than the Argus and pairs well with any high-damaging and heavy weapon like the Crusader, Saber, and Javelin. 

**Ease of Use**- All of the Uncommon weapons have a reasonably quick reload speed (as fast or faster than their counterparts) and great ammo capacity. That means even lower skilled players who miss shots can still deal sustained damage. Great examples include the Phaeston/Tempest with their 90 clip capacity and 450 spare ammo count

**Overarching Roles**- As a whole
______________________________________
*Miscellaneous*

**I am SO mod right now**- Attaching equipment and mods to these guns brings out the best in them. For example

**Tiered Weapons**- No one is going to argue that you MUST use these guns on Platinum. Like the Common weapons, those Uncommon weapons generally don't come close in terms of damage. Still, that doesn't mean they are bad. In fact, they have the great advantage of having much lower weight. That means they work exceptionally well with low level Rares and Ultra-Rares due to the massive weight some of those have.

______________________________________________

And that's why you should use the Uncommon weapons. They are easy to max out, and are easy to use. Don't let your elitism and big gins allow you to make fun of the Uncommons, because **DPS Isn't Everything^tm** .

PSA's should include one of the following: Important news about the multiplayer content of ME3, or the status of servers that either hinder someone's ability to play the game or enable them to play it.

Example PSA's:

PSA: Vanguard bug has gotten worse and now any Biotic Charge will bug you causing the game to crash.

PSA: Bioware announces (that no) new fix in the next patch for Vanguard crash bug.

PSA: PS3 servers are down again with no sign of them coming back online.

And now for examples of of things that should NOT have PSA's in the title.

PSA: New gun X is way too over powered and ruins the game.

PSA: Vanguards should not use Sniper Rifles.

PSA: The new Vorcha heavy melee pushes you foreward when doing X.

These are all things that are not super important but should have a normal thread posted on them. 

AGAIN - The PSA's will not be banned or removed by a mod for not following these guidelines. If one is removed it will be for a different reason. If you post a PSA wrong, or PM me anytime. Thanks guys. Also, spelling errors are a given, I'm on an iPhone PoS.",,False,self,1338928082.0,t3_um9fl

**THE KROGAN LIVING TANK**

This build focuses on survivability and tanking the brunt of the damage for your team while still offering large amount of firepower. 

I chose the Krogan sentinel due to the high base health of the Krogan race along with the Tech Armor power to reach high amounts of effective health/shields.

This guide is intended for gold difficulty and will laugh at difficulties below it. You may feel like Grunt in his glorious cut-scene.

**Base stats:**

Health: 750

Shields: 1000

**Fully-built stats + Tech Armor:**

Health: 1200 (1

Shields: 1600 (2

In comparison

**Power Build**

Tech Armor: Durability - Melee Damage - Durability

Lift Grenade: Damage - Max Capacity - Damage &amp; Radius

Krogan Berserker: Weapon damage - Headshots - Weapon Damage

Rage: Durability - Shield Recharge/Martial Artist - Fitness Expert


Justification:

* Tech Armor - The explosion isn't worth losing out on damage reduction and 30% melee damage. Also this build utilizes very heavy weapons and forgoes any kind of power enhancements putting the skill on 20 second cooldown should you decide to explode it.

* Lift Grenade - It's either this or incinerate. I find incinerate very lackluster in gold matches even with a fully built power usage character. Lift grenades on the other hand have no cooldown which fits perfectly with our -200% cooldown weapons + tech armor penalty.

  I choose taking damage over increased CC because anything that can be lifted by the grenade is generally either killed by it or not important enough to warrant extra CC. Increased damage/radius is up to preference and how well you find yourself actually aiming the grenades.

* Krogan Berserker - A no-brainer

* Rage - The bonus to health/shields coupled with the extraordinary high health of the krogan race is what makes this build work. Your melee damage is already very high and is adequate to deal with any threats you might want to melee as long as you season it with shotgun pellets.

**Weapons**

M-99 Sabre (Extended Barrel + Armor Piercing) OR Carnifex (Scope + Extended Barrel)

M-300 Claymore OR Geth Plasma Shotgun (High Caliber Barrel + Armor Piercing)

Justification:

* AR: Along with your +damage talents and the extended barrel your sabre will be able to 1-2 shot basic troops/targets stripped of their shields. The Claymore is a 1 shot-reload shotgun with low ammunition so you really don't want to waste it on basic mooks unless necessary.

  The Sabre is quite rare so in the likely case you don't have one

* Shotgun: I tried the many varieties of shotguns and I found that multi shot shotguns don't do significantly more damage than your melee attack yet do not incapacitate the target. The geth shotgun with charged shots might work as a substitute but I did not experiment with it yet.

**General strategies**

The first thing to learn about this build is that while you are extremely tanky

You want to stay close to your team

Tech armor should always be active - Exploding it does little and leaves you vulnerable.

Your basic combo against shielded targets is shotgun to center body mass as you are closing in and finishing the target with a healthy dose of Krogan diplomacy (Heavy melee). Not advised against Geth Pyros.

If there are any other Krogan on the team

Your heavy melee will not hit prone targets and will make you look ridiculous. A proud Krogan warrior does not look ridiculous. Headbutting them is fine

Learn to animation cancel - both your weapons greatly benefit from it. The reload animation is longer than the time it takes for the weapon to become loaded. Generally once your character ""inserts"" the clip the weapon is loaded and executing any other animation (Skill usage

You are a big target. A huge, however, stop your shields from regenerating.

You have a lot of health

Alright, you got the ""Cain Mines are awesome"" bit down, but you're missing a big piece. That's what I'm here for.

* **Concussive Arrows**: Gives him great CC ability, with a total force of 2600N, and open it up with a 15% damage taken increase and 30% slow for 8 seconds, which is almost like a mini-Tac Scan. Use this on bosses, or use a spread shot to stagger a bunch of mooks at the same time. Awesome power, and it increases your Grenade Capacity-- well worth the point investment.

* **AP Arrows**: We're not using the Omni-Bow for damage

* **Omni-Bow**: Despite how much we're going to be using the Omni-Bow here, we use the Omni Bow for utility-- see the Strategy section.

**WEAPONS**

Kishock all the way. Not even a choice on this one-- this build is built around using this bad boy for all it's worth. The synergy between this gun and this class is so insane that if it wasn't for the complete lack of anything like this build, or ULM-- your choice. Thank you to u/yumpsuit for reminding me that Explosive ammo is also fantastic on the Kishock, so if you've got shit tons of it in reserve, this is a great opportunity to use it.

A few good things to know about the ~~weirdness~~ awesomeness that is the Kishock (if I get any of this wrong, unlike any other sniper rifle in the game, and has a uniquely low-magnification scope. This makes the best close-range sniper in the game. It can be charged to deal 1.75x its base damage, although because of the long charge time, when facing a large threat, it's more damaging to fire off shot after uncharged shot than to charge it up again for each shot. It is a projectile weapon, meaning that it has a travel time to hit its target but also suffers from no armor DR and is excellent at applying ammo effects, doing 60% of its damage upfront and the other 40% over the next 5 seconds. However, it does 2.4x of its stated damage upfront on a headshot, it cannot pierce cover

**GEAR**

Operative Package will boost both Cain Mines and the Kishock

**STRATEGY**

Now for the fun part. People always gripe about the Omni-Bow's terrible damage, Vanilla-Bow can stagger Captain-level enemies, which means pretty much anything with Health that's not a Phantom, and with Concussive Arrows it can stagger **anything**-- Atlases,  Banshees, it doesn't give a guddamn. This opens him up for great synergy with headshot builds, as it's literally a free, take the Supressor or Black Widow if you want

Another feature of the Omni-Bow is that when you hold it charged on an enemy, you can charge up the Kishock, lock onto an enemy with your Omni-Bow, and either fire the Omni-Bow, stagger them, and then let go of the Kishock for a double whammy, OR, just let go of the trigger on the Kishock while still locked on for an almost guaranteed bodyshot on an enemy. The Kishock suffers no hipfire penalty either

In summation, staggering enemies and then mowing them down with one of the most powerful guns in the game. This is a good bet if you're on high lag, since staggering enemies will compensate for the travel time of the Kishock projectile. The other way to play is by using the tracking of the Omni-Bow to snipe on easy mode, focusing on one enemy, staggering, and then instantly letting a Kishock bolt fly while letting the game track for you. It's difficult to describe, but if you try it

Lastly, you'll just need to play a bit closer to the action.

**CONCLUSION**

The Juggernaut is not my style, but I really want to. So, of the classes of Reckoning I've unlocked so far, the Talon is probably my favorite, and I hope this build makes you appreciate him the way I do. Don't forget to lay down Cain Mines, and just lock and shoot. Simple, but incredibly effective.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19ij2i/zaeeds_legacy_aka_how_to_make_the_talon/

I didn't really like the male Quarian at first, not even aiming.

Tactical scan might not seem like the best power at first

Its obviously best on bosses where you need as much damage as possible. Your time will be better spent shooting the mooks rather then taking time to scan them

Though the **one big thing that makes tactical scan awesome**

If there is one thing that will make any random drop everything he has to take on one target it is a big circle and a red outline. Seriously
___________________________________________________________________________
**Protip:** You probably want to do the whole cloak &gt; power thing at first, using this power with cloak will actually *slow you down* rather then enhance your effectiveness. It also has a animation that renders you unable to shoot making you unable to get the cloak bonus. The only situation I'd recommend using it with cloak would be if you need to infiltrate an area by scanning the boss character then quickly get out of there, but otherwise don't.

**ProProtip:** If you stand in cover then use scan at a target you will not break cover

* Can be frozen by Asari's (Vanguard

* After two or three Stasis freezes

* To lure them in, they will run in to attempt melee attack or execution move.  If you have to do it solo, try to have walls or objects nearby that you can back-up/circle around while firing at them so you can avoid their SMG fire.

* If you are pinned and/or have multiple phantoms and no Stasis control

**Engineer:** 

* The turret/backpack the engineer carries around will explode and usually take the engineer with it

* Catch them when they are laying the turret, as the turret will pop up automatically even if the engineer is dead.

**Pyro:**  

* The tank on their back will explode if fired upon.   

* Obviously you can hit the tank from the back side easy enough; from the front

**Rocket Trooper:**

* If you are real hot shit, and shoot missiles in mid-air.   When taking them head on, just aim slightly down and to the left when the missile is first fired and it will boom.  

**Cannibals:**   

* There is usually more than one to a group; head-shot or otherwise kill the first one, they will not get up from their feast until they are done and have the armor buff (which is not that strong anyway).


**Geth Prime:**  

* Quarian Infiltrator's Sabotage ability will mind-control the Geth Prime.  This can be effective if you are using it as a delaying tactic
* Headshots with a Widow or other high damage/armor piercing weapon are highly effective.   TacCloak Widow shot to the head on a Prime (on Gold difficulty) can take away nearly half their armor.

**Banshee:**  

* Go with a little Duke Nukem action.  Have your missile out and ready

Now, you'll probably feel like a war criminal for inflicting such pain and suffering on your foes.  Although I typically score very high on Gold matches, this is the only class where I have LITERALLY gotten PMs from people asking me how the fuck I did that.  One guy asked me what I did to my claymore to make it so good.  I responded: I soaked it in skill for three days and tempered it in blood of newborn innocent Geth.  That's how.

**Build:**
Energy Drain spec'd for shield restoration/ synthetic enemies/ AOE.

Fitness: All shields baby.

STG: Weapon damage.

Tactical Cloaca: Damage
Proximity Mine: ain't got no time for this garbage

Edit- Apparently it's good!  Emergency87 suggests *""The SI is already tough enough with cloak and energy drain; imho, and that 20% can really help, especially since the whole team benefits from it. Also, I've noticed that you can one-shot Ravagers if you apply the prox mine debuff first.""*

Claymore: (Mine is a measly Claymore III and works wonders) Smart choke and extra damage barrel

**(Optional) Equipment:** Incendiary ammo, Shield Amp, Shotgun rail amp.

Okay so here's what's up.  This class does best against Geth then Cerberus then Reapers.  Most of my strategy will be talking about the Geth.  Despite how many times you played them

Congrats!  You are now the most badass amphibian out there.  The sight of you in action will make a Krogan's quad ascend back up into their body.  Sorry

**Strategy:**
Get up close and personal.  Typically, once you get a feel for how much damage your boomstick does, you'll learn to kill enemies from mid range.
Tactical cloaca -&gt; run up to an enemy -&gt; energy drain -&gt; shotgun to the face.  Now back up while you reload, but ending enemy lives in one shot.  
Yes, you can easily ruin any enemy out there.  That brings us to...

**Enemies:**
Geth Hunter: If you have hated and feared Geth Hunters, you have disguised yourself as the cowardly Salarian Infiltrator, the natural prey of the Hunter, in order to draw them in.  They come in close, and it turns out you shotgun them to the face killing them instantly.  You don't even need to tactical cloaca if you don't want to, but do it anyway just to make him feel the pain.  Or go out and hunt them down- they will be distracted with some decoy or non-cloaked buddies so they'll be easy pickins.  Get used to seeing +895, Kill a LOT.

Geth Pyros: They don't die in one shot, ready to deal with harder enemies.

Geth Rocket Troopers: Easy peasy.  Cloaca-&gt; Energy Drain -&gt; Shotgun.  You can easily kill these guys at midrange.  Protip: since you'll almost never be in cover

Geth Primes: Get uncomfortably close to these guys and let rip.  Then run away.  Then repeat.  You want every pellet to land a headshot on these dude.  They should go down in around 3-4 hits.

Centurians: Easy

Nemesis: Ah, and take your time aiming at their faces.  You know the rest.

Phantom: Oh no!  It turns out you can pretty much one shot them as well.  Cloaca -&gt; Energy drain -&gt; shotgun to the head.  Getting close enough and getting a headshot is a nerve racking experience

Reapers: I haven't done enough testing against these guys on Gold.  Likely

So there you have it.  If I didn't mention the enemy

**Biotic and tech powers actually go together quite well.**

I'll explain. I first got this idea while playing as a human sentinel against Reapers, and it didn't take long to figure out that the engineer was spamming Energy Drain at the Brute as well. I started to rage about him canceling my combos until I noticed that this would happen:

* I hit Brute with Warp to set up a combo. 
* He hits Brute with Energy Drain for reasons unknown.
* I attempt to detonate my combo with Throw
* I immediately hit the Brute with another Throw

I was the only biotic on the team, which would damage and decrease damage resistance on the barrier. His Energy Drain would then deal a hit to the barrier, followed by another big hit from the tech burst I detonate. Follow up with a biotic explosion, and the Banshee is feeling the hurt. Doing this combo on a Banshee a couple of times left it almost dead (Silver) and also killed a number of Marauders and Cannibals near it. 

Applying these same powers in a different order achieved similar results: ED first

When playing with different people, but I think it doesn't interfere with BE's either.

1342975267.0,wyynq,How to Platinum Guide,NerubianAssassin,73,19,41,"I'm very tired of seeing crappy builds on platinum. Here's a guide to Firebase White and Firebase Glacier, makes me think you should be playing on a lower difficulty. 

**Classes**

There are a couple of classes that are both very easy to play

**Engineers**

**Salarian Engineer:** Decoy (duration/shock for tech bursts/shields) makes fighting geth significantly easier. Energy drain (damage/recharge/damage) is an excellent skill for both setting up tech bursts and maintaining your tankiness. Put decoy in front of the Firebase White chokepoint where the usual gold farming is done, while equipped with any weapon that provides +200% cooldown, spam *nothing* but energy drain. This is essential as you will be setting up and detonating tech bursts for your entire team. This is a *very* easy class to play, but immensely helpful due to tech bursts/decoy.

**Geth Engineer:** This class is also good on platinum, so I suggest carrying a GPS with your hunter mode (accuracy/rate of fire/damage), and geth passive (weapon damage/power damage/weapon damage). Note that overloads are not for the damage, but for the tech bursts.

**N7 Demolisher:** A very good class on platinum, so carry only one weapon as cooldown matters. **Spam arc grenades** (damage/electrical damage/shield overload) over homing grenades (damage/fire damage/armor damage). This is because arc grenades have a much larger aoe, and will deal more damage overall along with setting up/detonating tech bursts. Homing grenades should be used the least of your grenade powers. Your passive (damage &amp; max grenades/power damage/power damage) will give your grenades maximum power. With a +5 grenade capacity gear, you should be set. Do not take max grenades at lvl 6 because having 11 grenades compared to 10 is not significant compared to +20% power damage bonus. The reason why the N7 demolisher is good is you can turn your thermal clip consumables into missile equivalents, making you essentially have 10 missiles altogether. **90% of the time you should be spamming arc grenades** for tech bursts, not homing grenades as they deal less dps overall. And **do not be afraid to use as many thermal clips as you can.**

**Infiltrators**

**Salarian Infiltrator:** Tactics have not changed (damage cloak, but I like seeing them on plat.

**Geth Infiltrator:** With hunter mode (accuracy/rate of fire/damage) the N7 Piranha becomes another superweapon with the GI. Tactics have not changed either

**N7 Shadow:** **Spam Electric Slash.** This class I love to see on platinum, you are doing it wrong.** The correct build is similar to the Cerberus vanguard/adept, and is focused on spamming electric slash, 6/6/6/5/3. The passive is (damage &amp; capacity/power damage) and three points in sword mastery for the move speed bonus. Electric Slash (damage/**100% tech burst detonate**/damage) is your spamming power. **Tac cloak (duration, melee damage/bonus power), is unlike every other infiltrator specced for support**. This allows you to do the activate four nodes objectives very easily while your team holds down the fort, or revive teammates without worrying about the five sec cloaks that most infiltrators have. The cycle is cloak/electric slash, which allows you to spam electric slash at a steady rate (the first slash gets the tac cloak bonus damage, like the Cerberus Vanguard/Adept, **do not use weapons on this guy because the SI and the GI use weapons way better** than the N7 Shadow due to prox mine/hunter mode. **Melee damage is fun on silver

Honorable mention to QI, and N7 Demolishers do grenades better.

**Soldiers**

**N7 Destroyer:** This is the only soldier class I like seeing on platinum, though that might change with patches. You're good with any weapon basically, but currently the N7 Piranha is the easiest to use. High level Typhoons and Harriers are good too. As long as you're good at shooting things, this class is not particularly skill demanding. If you're bad and shooting things, I suggest playing the power based classes (Salarian Engineer).

**Biotics**

Standard biotic tactics have not changed. However, shield healing, decoys) compared to biotics, and mixing tech and biotics is less powerful than focusing on one. The mainstay Human Sentinel, Asari Adept, Drell Adept, Cerbeus Adept, and Asari Justicar are all good to varying degrees. The new N7 Fury and the N7 Slayer are also good. However

**N7 Fury:** Annihilation Field (Impact Radius/Damage Taken/Drain) is specced as such because 1. you want the +15% damage taken to affect as many things as possible 2. drain is better than more damage because it gives you survivability when you're surrounded by banshees, Throw is standard (Radius to increase chances that the combo hits/Detonate/Force &amp; Damage). Your teleport dodge is amazing, use it to go up and down levels, and through walls. Don't forget to recast annihilation field. If you're bunkered down by any camping area, +15% damage to the enemies in front of the cover is great. Similar playstyle to Asari Justicar, but teleport dodge as I said is great, and you can detonate your own combos.

**N7 Slayer:** Biotic Slash (Damage/Detonate/Damage) is basically the most important power. Spam it to set off biotic explosions,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1342976583.0,,,t3_wyynq

Looking at the data, the more people enjoy it. Our telemetry supports this, showing that easier levels were played the most.

Firebase Glacier is a prime example. This popular level received average gameplay and overall scores

The exception is the Hazard version of Firebase Ghost (Acid Rain)

**Map Comments**

We received a lot of great feedback on each level through this survey.  The next section summarizes the most common feedback for each level.

**Condor:**

Condor splits our fans into two groups. Some people loved the map, making the map difficult.

**Dagger (and Hazard Version)**

There are a lot of Dagger fans out there! Many of you liked the long ranges that made this a great sniping map

The map was a bit too open for some people

**Ghost (and Hazard Version)**

Firebase Ghost was our second-most popular map due to its balanced gameplay for short- and long-range experts. People mostly enjoyed the cover layout in the level and the visuals of the Hazard version (Acid Rain).

This level’s biggest drawback was its extraction point being lower than the surrounding area and being light on cover. Players enjoyed the level overall

**Giant (and Hazard Version)**

Most comments on this level were positive. Overall

There are mixed opinions on the extraction point. Some people found it easy

Comments on Giant’s Hazard version (Night) focused on the improved visuals and atmosphere

**Glacier (and Hazard Version)**

The most common comment on Glacier was that the map was too small. This tiny level is favored by close combat fans for its franticly fast pace. It’s quite easy to play so long as you maintain control of the area.

The Hazard version (Seeker Swarm) puts greater pressure on team coordination and map control. The seeker swarms made the map harder

And yes

**Goddess**

Goddess was seen as a pretty level with solid gameplay that kept you on your toes. The visuals were praised as one of the best of all the MP maps, as it was too easy to get surrounded.

**Hydra**

Hydra’s visuals received a lot of praise. (This made the artist very happy!)  Many players—especially snipers—liked the open style of the main area. Players noticed that difficulty was dependent on the enemy palette chosen. We received a lot of feedback on the extraction

**Jade**

Jade had something for every play style. Other than the extraction zone

**London**

The main comments on London were on cover and the open nature of the map. Players found a lack of cover in certain areas that made enemies difficult to deal with. This difficulty level generated a lot of comments, with ammo distribution and the map’s visuals getting positive reviews.

**Reactor (and Hazard Version)**

Reactor generated a lot of discussion about the map’s enemies. The bug in which enemies got stuck was a sore point as was the layout and lighting

The Hazard version (Meltdown) was definitely more popular than the base version with players enjoying the interactive part of the map. Overall

**Rio**

We received a lot of good feedback on Rio that we will account for in the future. This map was initially loved by players

**Vancouver**

This map is praised for how it plays with verticality more than any other level. While there was a good deal of positive feedback for this level, it gave players a great experience and had a great skybox. The biggest issue mentioned was that the ladder in the middle of the map should not have been so heavily relied upon as a main thoroughfare.

**White (and Hazard Version)**

This map received the most positive feedback. Players overwhelming felt that the layout corrections were for the best. There were good discussions about how the map discouraged players from camping and from employing a single strategy for all the games in the level. The majority of players (past and present) enjoyed White for its gameplay and excellent visuals.

Comments on the Hazard version (Whiteout) focused on the unmanageable visibility that was caused by the overlaying effects of certain powers like Krogan Rage and Adrenaline Burst in combination with the snowstorm. The atmosphere created by the snowstorm was appreciated

**Conclusion**

As you can see

Thanks so much!

Turian Veteran - 5 Points (power damage &amp; power damage) 

Fitness - 4 points (fitness) 

No 6 points in tech armour as the 4th point in fitness gives more benefit.

*Note - He also uses Geth Scanner Gear Equipment

This less focused on the class build but to the strength of the tech armour as explained in the the last DLC of ME3 single player where a Turian Cabal has a conversation with a Salarian on how a Turian tackles all his enemies with a tech armour and a combination of Overload or Warp. 
The reason why this is awesome is because of how well tech armour actually lived up to the Turian's words and Xcal astonishes even himself that he still ranked on top of the leaderboard above an EDI infiltrator and a Typhoon Destroyer.  

A visual demonstration is most definitely needed here because its not something you would not believe by word of mouth and on conclusion I believe Tech Armour maybe the solution to all problems.

[Well

* **We have some new weapons to go over**.  I plan to cover what *I feel* is needed to be covered. I could make a whole guide on every weapon available. @_@ I'd rather not. I hope you understand.  Leave a comment for any I won't be covering.

* **A new Faction**.  And holy crap

* **New enemies for each original Faction**.  Some more annoying/harder than others.

* **New teammates and synergy**.  Well

* **Gold gameplay and you**.  Added a section covering Gold (and applicable to beyond)

* ***USER SUBMISSIONS WELCOME!*** I'd really like to emphasize the idea of this fireside chat.  I'll be giving full credit to anyone's submission in this thread to anything that contributes to the Murdertrain here in the appropriate section. So please

Before we continue

[**MURDERTRAIN**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/KroganBattlemaster/RAQOP/NPiranha10AN5AO5//StrengthEnhancer3/CyclonicModulator4/JuggernautShield5/)

I swapped out the barrier buff in rank 4 for the extra 5% rather than the 30% Blast Buff since it got buffed in a patch/update.  I'd rather have even *some* more sturdiness.  Doesn't mean we won't pop barriers

****
&gt;**Feur Frei!**

****

So with the recent updates, we've gotten some noteworthy weapons.  Here are the ones I prefer:

**The Reegar**:  I mention this first, and relatively light.  But I don't like it for one reason; The range is terrible.  It stops dead in it's tracks after only a few feet (if that).  But, it's fantastic against barriers/shields, does great damage.  Chews through ammo though.  Only a 20 round capacity that gets eaten up quickly.

**The Piranha**:  If I'm not mistaken, probably over the Graal.  It's got more ammo (6) per clip, shoots fast, and is DEVASTATING up close.  Great for use with ""the Combo"" (Remember? Biotic Charge into Heavy Melee into Fire Shotgun+Shotgun+Shotgun until you can Charge again).  Even with the weight ""nerf"", it's still light enough to where I'd say it's worth it.

**Graal Spike Thrower**: We all know this is one of my personal favorites

&gt; It is a launch weapon, the weapon mods that increase weight are still bugged.

&gt; It is a non-hitscan weapon. It therefore ignores armor penalties. One no longer needs to equip the shredder mod to be effective against armor.

&gt; It is both accurate and powerful

&gt; Therefore, and you lose very little. In my games, I tend to favor more ammo except on Firebase Rio, because there is ammo everywhere. 

*Special thanks to Zelcron for the info.*



**AT-Raider/Claymore 2.0**: I say Claymore 2.0 because that's what it is.  A Claymore with 2 shots.  It's about as heavy as one, but I think you're better off with the other two or older shotguns.

**Acolyte**: Mentioning for it's uses.  Recently buffed and then nerfed.  It's now a ""charge me"" gun again.  I would say ""Yes"" to this gun, take it.  You can slap ""Ultra Lightweight Materials"" on it, and not mess with your cooldown.  If you ask me, I feel Warp ammo is a little better with the Piranha.   But that's my personal preference.

While I'm at it

I won't sit here and say what's ""THE BEST"".  Take what is best for you.  What I can recommend is the following:

* Berserker Package : Weapon Damage Bonus (Shotguns)/Melee Damage Bonus

* Stronghold Package : Shield Bonus

* Mental Focuser : Power Damage Bonus

* Structural Ergonomics : Power Recharge

* Multicapacitor : Shield Recharge Delay

* Shield Booster : Shield Bonus
* Shotgun Amp : Weapon Damage Bonus (Shotguns)
* Hydraulic Joints : Melee Damage Bonus
* Adaptive War Amp : Biotic Power Damage Bonus
* Juggernaut Shield : Melee Damage Bonus/Shield Bonus
* Martial Biotic Amp : Melee Damage Bonus/Biotic Power Damage Bonus
* Omni-Capacitors : Power Recharge / Power Damage Bonus

Also

****

&gt; **I wanna Jitterbug...**

****

So

Now that they're ***HERE***... We don't know what we've gotten ourselves into.

Let me do my best by trying to go over what I've found to be successful so far.

**Abominations/Husks**: So these little bastards have a neat little trick up their sleeve.  They go boom.  One, and then one or two (or more) slip past you and *then* go boom? Now it's a problem. Low on the threat level, but I'd still try to take them out sooner than later.  Especially if they start glowing.

**Collector Trooper**: Standard troop for Collectors. SMGs. Melee attacks

**Collector Captain**: Your next step up from Trooper

**Seeker Swarm**: This is going to **FUCK UP** your day. Why? Because it's going to ***KILL*** your cooldown. That's what the swarm does.  You're unable to use *any* power for a set period of time while the frakkin' thing is around you.  Which brings me to my next point...

**Possesion**: Harbinger will **ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL** of something

* Abominations now have Barriers.

* Troopers now deploy Webs.  Webs just slow you down and get in your way. Just shoot them.

* Captains have twice as much health and deploy Seeker Plagues.

* A Seeker Plague has a Barrier.

Basically

Next up

**Scion**: Remember this jack hole from ME2? Back.  Shoots a Geth Prime cannon now.  Packs a mean punch.  Will wreck your face with it.  He *can* insta-kill you

* Possessed Scion have more armor (50%) and Barriers.  They also shoot grenades at you.  Oh

**Praetorian**: To put it lightly, making it difficult to get a good bead on them.  Oh, they attack at melee range too.  And fast.  So... Basically you're dealing with a flying Banshee who shoot freaking laser beams out of their freaking heads.  Team effort on this one.

*  Possessed version shoots missiles.  Stronger Barriers and Armor (50%)

... So that's fun
****

&gt; **No More Mr. Nice Guy**

****

So with the DLC that we got

**Dragoon**:  They're joking, it's another Vanguard... But you do it SO much better! Just charge, melee, shoot.  In that order. They just have armor, and have a LONG build up time.  They cover a lot of ground, but aren't much to worry about.  Remember the combo.

**Geth Bomber**:  These sneaky little bastards are stupid annoying (no sounds, and they fly.  Charge, and shoot.  Trying to melee/heavy melee is gonna be tricky.  You'll miss a lot.

____________________________________________________

*Why does the Crusader get hate?*

**This isn't a gun, this gun is exceptionally heavy. It should be the first thing anyone notices when using the Crusader. No one likes an exceptionally heavy weapon, especially when this weapon is somewhat difficult to wield, requiring another weapon if the user is not a God's gift to shooting.

**What is this, expecting a decent spread for close range. 

**The only thing you should feel when shooting

**Their shields CAN hold firepower of that magnitude**- Lastly, it can get quite annoying to be constantly blocked by shield-gating. 

Now combine all these flaws with it being a N7 ultra-rare
________________________________________________
*And why should the Crusader get some love?*

**BOOM! HEADSHOT!**- In between its amazing accuracy and high power per hit, who doesn't want to absolutely destroy Phantoms?

**Mowin 'em down

**I AM DESTROYER OF METAL MEN!**- Like the relationship between [ductility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility) and [tensile strength](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_strength) in a material, and the Crusader can ravage Ravagers and other boss enemies.

**I AM COMING FOR YOU!**- As an extra bonus, and thin cover without losing damage potency. Quite useful ability indeed.
____________________________________________________
*Miscellaneous* 

**Don't equip the Shredder or Smart Choke mods**- The Crusader is already laser accurate, and it decreases the damage when piercing, which is undesirable. Unless you focus on melee a lot, I just recommend the Spare Thermal Clip and High Caliber Barrel mods on all Crusaders. 

**Do put this gun on someone where weight won't be too much of an issue**- The main disadvantage of the Crusader is its weight. Once that is dealt with, Krogan Sentinel, Vorcha Sentinel, or, if you are feeling a little gutsy, a Batarian or [Human Soldier](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/vo9s2/the_human_paladin_soldier_crusader_build/).

And that is why you should reconsider using the Crusader. Don't write it off as soon as you get it

--------------------------------


If you're like me, but not often, and its usually hit-and-run. 

However

- In addition to high damage, **The Vorcha Heavy melee seems to grant Damage Resistance comparable to the legendary Batarian Heavy Melee.**

- More importantly

This means that it isn't just a way to deal damage and stumble [typically isolated] squishies and the like

The Vorcha play style seems to lend itself to highly aggressive and mobile combat (the evade is by far my favorite in ME at the moment), with the Heavy Melee being used to break shields and keep you standing.

--------------------------

*This has only been actively tested on Silver at the moment, which seem well-equipped to counter him with hordes of Pyros and Hunters), but taking advantage of this damage resistance has made such a big difference that I'm beginning to think the Vorcha could be quite useful on Gold. (I certainly hope so)

1338323253.0,uavi7,Initial Thoughts on Rebellion,Zombie_Hunter,56,5,120,"First off

**Cerberus Adept**

The Cerberus adept to me seems very different than previous uses of the class. This character needs to be up close and personal for its primary power (smash) to be utilized. The leash power is fun, while the heavy melee involves sweeping in a circle around the adept.

**Vorcha Sentinel**

Another change up on what I'm used to, but I hardly ever went down thanks to the constant regeneration. Flamer makes me feel like a Geth Pyro. It is excellent against armor and health, but average against shields. An unshielded enemy will stagger and freak out from the flames, however. Cluster grenades are welcome, if unexpected, and they're useful if one has accidentally overextended. This seems like a front line fighter in my book.

**Male Quarian Infiltrator** 

I love this character. This to me is set to be a wonderful sniper. The Tactical scan paired with cloak makes for a good combination

**Krysea Sniper Rifle**

I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. The vaunted zooming sniper scope didn't help me very much

**Firebase Goddess**

There is no way you're going to be standing still on this map. It makes me think of Reactor in this respect; there's not a great place to bunker down. The higher elevation is nice for firing down at enemies

**Firebase Jade**

This is one of my new favorite maps. While there isn't a spot in it like the basement for White, only to find I couldn't go that way.

[Here is a sweet diagram I made in MS paint of Firebase White.](http://i.imgur.com/8yQSL.png)

It is not to scale.

*    Red boxes are ammo
*    Green boxes and lines are cover
*    Yellow lines are ladders
*    Blue boxes are spawn points of the hack something and defending it
*    Numbers will be zones I refer to

**What this works best against:**

I have personally had the easiest time with this strategy against Gold geth. I normally play a quarian infiltrator

It is also doable with Gold Cerberus

If you use this spot on silver

**What not to do:**

In most pugs I do on this map, and 3. The only cover you have will not protect you from every direction, and the ladder makes it easy for things to get into melee range.

**What to do:**

The second the game starts, and 6. With these 3 zones, nothing can spawn behind you and they will only come at you from one direction. Zone 4 and to the right of zone 5 will be the main kill areas. Enemies will spawn in zones 3, 7, 2, and 1. This means they will all funnel into areas for you to lay into them with biotics and tech attacks.

**Where to position yourself and your team:**

You basically want to have two people in zone 5 and two people in the L shaped cover at zone 4. Zone 4 will probably see the most action

**What to do when you have to hack the 4 nodes:**

This time around I'll be doing heavy pistols and will also be revising a few things in regards to how I put these together.

I figured I'd adjust these slightly since they didn't make sense in certain ways

Damage will stay mostly the same as a category as it's fairly straightforward. However

Usability is also mostly the same, and the accuracy are evaluated here. I've decided not to include rarity since it didn't really make sense to include in how a gun directly handled. However, ammo capacity will be considered here.

Lastly, how well it applies ammo powers, and any additional utility effects it has (such as falcon stagger).

Operation Lodestar is my favorite operation in a long

It forces people who don't usually play platinum (which judging by the recent info-graphic is just about everyone) to actually challenge themselves and step up their game.

Now, one against each faction. 

---

**Geth**
---

I always like getting the worst part out of the way first

There really isn't much to say about it, invincibility, speed, amazing dodge, shield-regen and reegar. What could possibly go wrong?

...

Here are the [Results](http://imgur.com/a/lXGVr#0)

This went about the way I expected. The only waves I had some trouble on were wave 2 (fucking triple primes) and 9

The AIU is just as powerful in a solo as I expected it/her/whatever to be. The geth-staggers are still dangerous and reegar range isn't always the safest place to be

And even if you mess up, this is the class to go with. Krogan vanguard or ghost are just as easy, but I feel that the AIU will at least teach you some manner of good positioning and reasonable play by showing you when you would have died with a ""normal"" class, instead of just being flat-out invincible like the ghost and the kroguard. 

Objectives were circle hack, and I still had 4 missiles for wave 10, so that was pretty chill as well. 

To my surprise I only died three times (I think). I like telling myself I could have also done this with the geth or the drell

It was also the first time I didn't use consumables except missiles. Who needs medi-gel and ops-packs if you are invincible?

No video for this one

Also for some reason I always have weird framerate issues if I record on white. Most of the time it sticks at 60 as usual

I'll probably not make a separate post about this build

The only thing that kind of goes against the usual build is dropping the last rank of snap freeze for three points in fitness. It's not a big deal either way but the last rank of snap freeze is pretty useless and the fitness might occasionally help a little bit every now and again. 

I also went with comfort over damage by taking the shotgun spare ammo and grenade cpapacity. They really aren't necessary

So yeah, I don't really feel that the AIU needs a big nerf, just some tweaks to make repair matrix less spammable and maybe reduce the shield-regen a little. 

Bonus: [AIU gold.](http://imgur.com/a/IqorW) I felt I had to get one of these in before they nerf it. 24min isn't bad for white and I was too much of a pussy to do glacier (against cerberus). With better objectives and less miserable missiles I could probably get it done two or three minutes quicker

Not as quick as krogan vanguard though. 

---

**Reapers (a)**

Next up, that's it.) 

So I decided to get a little playful and bring out one of the true overpowered classes in this game
I went [all out with the weapons](http://i.imgur.com/reEKyUw.jpg) for this one though

I don't think I've ever actually played this class on platinum before

Cryo blast is one of the absolute best powers in this game (along with proximity mine)

...

[Fuck this stupid fucking game](http://imgur.com/a/7sdCe#0). I was so pissed after that one. 

Until that point

I died the first time on wave 8

The sync-kill in the end was absurdly unlucky. I was trapped in a bad spot with banshees and phantoms coming from the control room on the right and the atlas standing on the left

Didn't work out so well and I died. I immediately popped medi-gel because I didn't want the banshees to reach me and of course I immediately got grabbed by the atlas. 

I watched the recording of it and unfortunately the atlas had meleed me while I had my back turned

And now after adding the links to loadout and build I realize that I'm a complete fucking moron and didn't have armor-piercing on the harrier. Fuck. So *that's* why banshees took so long to kill. 

This isn't even the first time I've messed this up. I once did a destroyer gold solo with an armor-piercing less PPR. I somehow still managed to win that one though. 

Retrying the same thing again right away is always frustrating to me

**Collectors**

I had originally planned to do a typhoon turian soldier against collectors (shamelessly copying aaron)

For variety's sake I decided to go with a bit of a wonky weapon setup

...

[Here is the result.](http://imgur.com/a/2HG1s#0)

Worked out pretty decently

Objectives were pizza, so kill targets was just missile spam. 

62mins is an okay time in my book. I lost a lot of time on the wave with the three scions

I've already done a post about the [geth infiltrator here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16vo2n/unnecessarily_long_guide_the_higher_being_geth/)

First the geth plasma shotgun is simply an excellent solo weapon, as it means that you can shoot while running, while staggered (incredibly helpful against hunters), and you can shoot it without breaking cloak. 

The particle rifle is purely there as an anti-boss weapon and in my opinion it is the very best anti-boss weapon in the game (well

I didn't record this one either because I already have a [GI plat solo vid here](http://youtu.be/dszdBo08R2g). The other reason is that hunter mode and recording together are a bit hard on my pc. I don't like playing at less than 60fps (yes I know

I'm very happy collectors worked out on the first attempt especially after the FQE drama. Anyways, unless I have another really frustrating failure.

If I fail again

...

[YES! I actually did it. Plat solo with a female quarian engineer.](http://imgur.com/a/WWQ8a) 

[Here is the video.](http://youtu.be/QtEbKQVjKS4)

Wow, so that was easy, but on 6 I got 1234s and one of them was in the really bad spot ahead of the LZ to the left (where the entire map can shoot you). Died once and had to use a missiles to get that one done. 

After that it was smooth sailing again until wave 10 where I got a drone objective

I also messed up extraction really badly and was very lucky that I got extracted. I died in the LZ with only three seconds left

I recorded this one

And to be honest, definitely not as bad as some people make her out to be and I'm a huge fan of cryo blast but I just didn't expect to do this well with her. For comparison, this only took about 6 minutes longer than my huntress solo with the same weapons. 

Only one more left to go now and still about 25 hours left. I might do the justicar or the asari vanguard against cerberus

Also depends on when I have time to play

---

**Cerberus**

I decided on [the justicar](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AsariJusticar/RPQFF/CerberusHarrier10AD5AF5/Acolyte10BA5BK5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/ArmoredCompartments5/). Cerberus is in my opinion the hardest faction to solo after the geth and I wanted a rock solid class for this one. 

The justicar is incredibly versatile with great mook and phantom killing abilities thanks to acolyte+pull+reave

Seriously, she is amazing and she is amazing to have as a teammate. 

...

[And here are the results.](http://imgur.com/a/Ol0eY#1)

[Here's the video.](http://youtu.be/35dpEw3EnLE)

Yeah, it doesn't count as an extraction for the challenge. Stupid game. 

This is in my opinion the most well played platinum solo I've done. 49min is an amazing time in my book. I've only done two quicker ones

I had some huge trouble with dragoons

I'm also absolutely not redoing this because of one stupid second. I count this as a win and I'll just complete the actual challenge in a team game. 

I have a recording of this game as well

I was burning through some challenges as a Krogan. I was playing with a kid that wasn't playing well at all

This kid was really young and seemed like he was afraid. The other kids had slightly-deeper voices and were harassing this poor kid while trying to kiss my ass for carrying them. I put my mic in after a few rounds and just pretended to be a Krogan and yell at this kid

I told this kid to give me his ""War Cry."" He yelled into his mic and it was so damn adorable. The rest of the match I role-played a Krogan and did my best to protect this kid's character. We were on Vancouver, each time yelling into my mic like a Krogan. We managed to finish and during extraction, the 2 little shits that were picking on him both got sync-killed and I gave no effort into saving them. This kid and I extracted, I had to help him a lot.

I didn't hear anything from any of them once we finished, but it was a little rewarding to think I might've helped him feel better and have a more enriching MeCoOp experience.

I received some positive feedback after I spoke about that time

Since then I've made it a habit to inject a little ""role-play"" when I play. I've since finished most of the challenges,"" ""this one is appreciative,"" ""this one requires assistance to complete the objective""(for lazy pugs that don't bother with objective phases).

As you know

**COBRA MISSILES**.

* According to my interpretation of the variable names in coalesced.ini (found at bioweapon.ini\sfxgamempcontent\sfxweapon\heavy\consumable\rocketlauncher)
* The missiles also hit through walls.
* Since the weapon appears to have an actual damage value
* Allies, it's often a good idea to aim at the floor so that missiles don't sail off into the wild blue yonder.
* On non-objective waves
* On objective waves: with hacks on gold, say, a VIP atlas and a guardian, the next target will often be a guardian rather than an atlas.
* Remember that on objective waves, roughly the cost of a jumbo equipment pack and worth far more to you than one measly missile.
* It's a good idea to switch to your missile launcher as soon as the thought ""oh shit!"" has entered your head. Those times your team is stuck in a cycle of being killed and revived? That time your on wave 9 and pinned by two banshees? When you see three phantoms over the corpse of the guy you came to revive? All good times to use a nuke.

**OPS SURVIVAL**

* Often people use ops survival packs and complain that they were taken down moments later. While this is sometimes due to lag, atlas rocket, marauder bullet etc) which completely depletes your shields won't pass through and damage your health. After your shields blow, you get total immunity to damage for a short time - 0.5/0.25/0.1/0.01 seconds depending on your difficulty level. After this, even if your shields are restored, your shield-gate *won't* block large amounts of damage for 1.5 seconds).
* It's a good idea to remap the key for the ops pack to something you can reach in a panic (I've got mine on 'Q').
* In coalesced.ini

**MEDIGEL &amp; REVIVES**

* When you're revived
* Users on the PC often remap the medigel key to something convenient (like 'E') so that they can reload cancel - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11033675/1 better.
* People seem to have fewer medigel than other consumables. IMO this is an indication that they (and I include myself here) should be using other consumables like ops survival packs and cobras more. It's pointless hoarding those - you're going to have to buy a jumbo equipment pack when you run out of medigel, that if you max out your weapon rail amps, ammo types and armor modules, that jumbo equipment packs start giving you nothing but ultra-rare weapons. Unless you have a desperate need for pistol rail amp Is, I suggest using your consumables. I guarantee you'll make more money that way.
* It's often fairly sensible to wait for a bit and tap the spacebar than revive instantly and hope that noone noticed your death. You don't want to run out of medigel and die just before deactivating the fourth device because you used a medigel of shame during wave 1.
* You can often cancel the 'getting up' animation with a heavy melee or a dodge. Useful if a praetorian is over your corpse.

**THERMAL CLIP PACKS**

* Thermal clip packs restore your ammo, and, according to BSN user peddroelmz's measurements, give you a 100% additive damage boost for a few seconds.
* As with other consumables

Finally: a reminder that failing the wave 10 objective on gold when you have a realistic shot at succeeding without using every last consumable is a pointless economy. You loose far more money than you gain.

1346516850.0,z6t4r,Salarian Engineer: make playing with terrible teammates a pleasure.,I_pity_the_fool,49,4,31,"People often think of the salarian engineer as a pure support class, *and* doing respectable damage. 

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#22PPDNJI9@0KE@@D4E4@0@0) is my build. Since I don't have too much in incinerate, and energy drain can still provide survivability when fighting marauders and banshees. Packing a big-arse gun will allow you to get through any faction.

First though

**Energy Drain**

This ability does 220 base damage, so it should be clear to you that energy drain is really not there to damage shields but to improve your engineer's survivability. And it does - draining a barrier, shield or synthetic enemy (geth, turret or atlas) instantly restores your shields. Energy drain also stuns most organic enemies who are down to health, which is useful if you use a weapon like the scorpion or GPS, which can sometimes be vulnerable to lag (or terrible aiming in my case).

There's some debate over whether the rank 6 evolution ""Armor boost"" works when you're not the host. Most of the sensible posters on the BSN agree however that it's just that you don't see the visual effect. Certainly I seem to notice the difference off host.

The BSN is also fairly unsure of how long the electrical effect of energy drain is. ~~The consensus is, you must detonate within 1 second, or within 3 seconds on shields or on synthetic enemies. Compare this with the 3.5 second duration of overload and disruptor ammo. Not long, eh? You probably aren't going to be detonating your own tech bursts without disruptor ammo - incinerate has a loooooong travel time to its target and your cooldown even with 200% is 2.46 seconds.~~ Who gives a damn what the BSN thinks! Actual information from someone who knows what he's talking about - [link](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/12648909). The window is 3 seconds!

There's a variable called ""maxtargets"" in the coalesced file, lots of powers have this limitation). So damage rather than radius is a respectable choice.

Finally

**Decoy**

The real meat of the class - this is the reason why you picked salarian engineer. When you cast decoy, if you're sheparding a drone on firebase white and you're going up the stairs from the desks to the LZ, you can face the wall inbetween the two flights of stairs and the decoy you cast will appear in the inside staircase, ready for the primes that are coming down to meet you. Casting the decoy near spawn points, then running back to the rest of your team can make objective waves very, *very* easy.

One mistake some players make is not to cast the decoy preemptively. They cast it after they get in trouble and not before. If a phantom has seen you, to place the decoy somewhere visible. It's also a good idea to cast the ability around corners, so that you don't end up with a face full of marauder elbow. The decoy can be used as a scout like that.

Getting a banshee trapped on a decoy is definitely a mitzve for your teammates. In my experience, once trapped, she seems to stay there helplessly novaing the decoy until the rest of the team can take her down. Getting atlases trapped similarly requires you to approach very closely and cast the decoy practically on their groin.

My decoy says it has 1900 shields, my decoy should actually have around 3000 effective shields.

Despite the fact that the shock evolution leaves a sparkly electrical side effect, the stun will often shock them back behind it. Your other choice is recharge speed, and who, frankly, takes that on any power? 

There appears to be a limit on how many enemies will target the decoy at the same time. This [balance change](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/9544143/1#11488308) ""decreased the maximum number of enemies that will target them at the same time."" I can't find any details in coalesced.ini though.

One thing to bear in mind is that during objective waves random teammates, and force the enemy to respawn right next to the infiltrator disarming the devices. During most objective waves, it's a good idea to leave snagged enemies alone. Especially during a wave 10 hack objective, a decoy can grant sensible teammates a few seconds free of the endless banshee-cobra cycle.

Finally, can still hit you if you're standing right behind the decoy. That should be an obvious point, but it's quite easy to forget until your face is actually on fire.

**Incinerate**

I'm not a fan of this power. It takes its time traveling towards the enemy, it can be dodged. You also won't be setting off your own tech bursts with it, and setting fire explosions up requires killing the enemy which is difficult with your other power unless you're fighting geth. Unlike energy drain, it has no AoE without the rank 4 evolution. Also bear in mind that the frost synergy evolution is broken - you do extra damage only to frozen enemies, not to chilled ones.

It does have its uses though. With three points in it, and secondly because they don't really engage your decoy at point blank range like the geth). I also use it to hook around cover, dislodging far away enemies so that they can get a few shots to the face.

Operation Goliath
Citadel Allied Command is mounting a galaxy-wide operation to cripple the Reapers’ shock troops: the turian-krogan hybrids known as “brutes.” To flush out Reaper ground forces

Community Goal: Inflict heavy casualties on Reaper “brutes” on March 16th

Community Unlock: If this goal is met

Squad Goal: Successful extraction from a Reaper-held zone at a Silver threat level or higher.

Squad Unlock: Your squad will be granted a Commendation Pack.

Your allies are counting on you. Now is not the time to let them down.

Any player who is part of a squad that beats the Reaper faction on Silver difficulty or better will unlock one Commendation Pack. This means that at least one member of the squad must be extracted at the end of the mission – this will earn all squad members the reward. Each player can earn a maximum of one pack, N7 Eagle Pistol, N7 Hurricane SMG, and N7 Valiant Sniper Rifle.

For this effort, don't remember the Armor Module I selected here and don't have it on video).  I'm also playing with a PUG specifically picked to be about Par for random Gold lobbies; the idea is to present a viable style of play that is accessible to any player (though technically, the consumable upgrades I have are usually obtained through higher-tier packs).

Keep in mind, I think the general principles on display here are effective and can be utilized by players of all skill, with a little practice.

I've put up two versions of the video

[**Commentary Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roVmJGaiotw)

[**Non-Commentary Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ)

Note, but this simply isn't true.  The Primer and the Detonator need to be different - in retrospect, I regretted saying this but I didn't want to re-record 25 minutes of commentary for the third time.

As for highlights

* [Checking Flanks: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=15m52s) After killing several enemies

* [Covering Teammates: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=9m9s) Here

* [Staying Safe with Mobility: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=11m13s) The team is getting swarmed after an objective and I lose my shieldgate.  I run away and reposition while my shields restore.

* [Soft Cover: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=13m7s) You can use soft cover to limit the number of enemies with line-of-sight on you.  Here

* [Avoiding Attacks with Movement: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=14m2s) As long as your are mobile

* [Retreat and Reposition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=8m14s) &amp; [Retreate and Reposition 2: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=16m53s) If you're in the open, the best option is often to run away and approach your enemies from their flank.  Note, I use an Ops Pack in both links to ensure I don't go down in the midst of a swarm of enemies.

* [Right Hand Advantage: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=23m22s) While this is a fairly poor execution of the technique

* [Hero Revive: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=9m27s) When enemies are targeting your teammates

* [Cover Revive: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=15m46s) When you have the opportunity

* [Revive Missile: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=12m3s) When a couple of your teammates go down near a heavy enemy, it can prevent your team from going down and getting swarmed even more.

* [Spawn Nuking: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=18m31s) Again, if you can take out a spawn with a missile, it can make the match proceed more quickly.  Only recommended if you have the missiles to spare.

* [Double Boss Missile: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=19m51s) Similar to spawn nuking

* [Switch Targets Missile: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=22m4s) In an enemy targets objective, it made the final objective wave proceed more smoothly.

* [Hero Device Objective: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=4m7s) This was a very risky play and, I was taking advantage of my teammates distracting the Prime for a device location that can be very difficult, and it barely managed to pay off.  This is also where using relatively tanky classes can help.

I hope some people find this a helpful example of effective gameplay.  I would like to recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvAYYO3DQo#t=6m50s)

Now that we're at 200

* The first and primary thing I want to do, so I was hoping some of our elite players (preferably people who can solo platinum, or &lt;user idea here&gt;).  The idea would either be to go through the builds and see what difficulty a given build is best on. I realize that may be hard, as playstyles vary. My alternative is a 5 star rating system. Again, based on a few of the subreddit's elite players, it would give a general idea of the synergy and playability of the build. Downsides are that there are numerous ""fun"" builds that would get bad ratings and thus overlooked. 

* The second thing I want to do, but my best idea for this is to have submitters look over their builds and update them and send me new build links or just tell me they're archaic and have them marked as such. (I currently plan on leaving archaic builds in the BBLoB for the sake of stats). 

I have to give a tip of the hat to the following users for exceptional contribution.

* First and foremost: /u/RepublicanShredder. Dude makes up 17% of the list with his 34 builds. He's also the only one who has at least one build for every class. 
* /u/spark2 is a more *recent* incarnation of Shred and has gotten 11 posted so far. (Only missing a Sentinel.)
* /u/blackmarketdolphins, /u/InterwebNinja, /u/mrcle123, /u/UnholyDemigod, /u/Multidisciplinary all have made at least 5 builds and, combined with spark2 and Shred, combine for nearly half of the builds.

1358029699.0,16gihh,ME3 Co-op College - Races 104: Asari,Multidisciplinary,52,5,44,"*Have you ever faced an asari commando unit before? Few humans have...*

While they may not live up to their billing as some of the deadliest fighters in the galaxy in SP

**General Advice**

The asari are all biotic kits. To utilise them to their maximum potential, how to co-ordinate best with other biotic teammates and so forth. I recommend familiarising yourself with the links in the sidebar for a basic overview. Generally all the kits have at least a biotic primer, so using warp ammo on your weapons will give a big damage boost. They will all work brilliantly with each other, and also in general biotic death squads. While their squishiness may seem to force them towards a long-range playstyle, in reality they can also shine with hit-and-run tactics at medium to CQC range, and will often deal much more damage doing so. 

**Racial Passive and Fitness**

The kits share the racial passive, and is balanced by offering somewhat lower weapon damage. The final evolution is for heavy pistols, apart from the Justicar Adept, who has  an evo for Assault Rifles. 

Their fitness isn't great, the biotic skating. Precise and quick, but the downside is it drains your barriers somewhat. Well worth it though as judicious use will keep you dancing with boss units safely, and bring you in and out of soft cover easily. Usually not worth spec'ing into melee, unless you're playing a specific build for a couple of kits (Huntress, Valkyre) which I'll mention later. 

**Asari Adept**

The very first overpowered kit when the game was released (the only nerf in the first set of balances changes is a nerf to Stasis)

* Stasis: An excellent crowd control power, Centurions and most importantly, Phantoms. The bubble evolution in rank 6 will trap multiple enemies and can be very beneficial in saving teammates about to get stomped or sync-killed. 
* Warp: Solid all-around biotic power. The primer for most biotic explosions the adept will unleash. Also good at debuffing bosses. Does get dodged, or initiate the dodge animation first by shooting etc
* Throw: Good detonator for BEs. Very quick cooldown. Also good for staggering enemies. 

The adept is generally used either as a caster-sniper, with hopefully my newly-written up Thessian Demolisher to be added shortly. The Carnifex, Paladin, Talon (my favourite), Wraith, Hurricane etc all work very well on her. Heck if you take a power efficiency amp, a heavier weapon with warp ammo becomes feasible too. 

**Asari Justicar Adept**

This kit stands out, which benefits her powers considerably. She synergises well with almost any team, and is one of the easiest kits with which to step up to playing higher difficulties.

* Biotic Sphere: The Justicar casts a biotic bubble. This can be spec’d either for offense (enemies take more damage) or defence (players in the bubble get added damage reduction). I prefer the offensive bubble, while warp effect at rank 6 will her set off her own BEs on Reaved targets, and prime un-Reaved targets to be detonated by Reave. On the other hand, defensive bubble is a great help during hacks and the like. Test both, see which one suits you.
* Reave: Reave is an excellent power and should always be taken to rank 6. It acts as both a primer and detonator for BEs (but not for itself, making her very tanky. It has a DoT component meaning it can be used as a fire-and-forget power, and it also stacks on itself (up to three times). 
* Pull: Arguably the weakest power

There’s quite a few builds on the BBLoB, able to absorb a decent amount of punishment via Reave’s protections, and synergises very well with other asari kits. 

**Asari Valkyrie Sentinel**

The close-in brawler of the asari kits, and allows her to stay alive at the distances Annihilation Field needs her to be at to work.

* Tech Armour: Standard sentinel power. Allows for extra tankiness when married with fitness. Usually its smarter to take ranks in it and both fitness rather than max it out
* Warp: Here
* Annihilation Field: As with the Fury, as it applies to any damage done to an affected target. 

Essentially, or you can you go with a more weapon-focussed build, debuffing with both AF and Warp, detonating the occasional BE but mostly dishing out the pain with a heavy shotgun like a Raider or a Reegar. One of my favourite kits to take to Platinum because of how good a boss-killer she can be. There is also a decent melee Valkyrie build out there being run on gold by some players, but I’ve never tried it myself. Search youtube.

**Asari Huntress Infiltrator**

From CQC brawler to DoT assassin- the Huntress is one of the most unique infiltrator kits thanks to the power damage she can get from her cloak, especially against Reapers, if anyone is looking to do that soon.

* Tactical Cloak: That old infiltrator power, and the 3 second TC cooldown means that heavy weapons can be carried without hobbling casting too much.
* Dark Channel: An average power on the Fury, and watch carve through an entire mook spawn, or even take down a Phantom. The ultimate fire-and-forget power. Also a primer, if you want to detonate with warp. Note that detonating it does not end the DoT effect. 
* Warp: A detonator and a debuffer here. Talked about it enough before. 

The best way to play her is listed on the BBLoB. No, but that is by far the optimal one. An interesting variant is the melee Huntress, again not listed here, but one I’ve seen played very effectively on Plat. Her melee damage is boosted by cloak, and is AoE meaning she can simply run, debuff and one-shot mooks and elite mooks with her heavy melee. 

**Asari Vanguard**

The vanguard was thought to be underwhelming for a long time

* Biotic Charge: The vanguard staple. Evos will depend on playstyle. I prefer grenade nuking
* Stasis: As with the adept
* Lift Grenades: Superb damage dealers. Terrible primers and detonators as they will only work on health-bar targets. Anything down to a healthbar when a grenade hits it is going to be dead. Don’t bother trying to base a playstyle around that aspect of them

Again, and staying alive on any difficulty becomes easier. 

**Conclusions**

The asari offer a great mix of kits, and their squishiness can definitely be offset by their mobility. Those of us who love the space magic that Mass Effect offers, the difference that distinguishes it from many other games, should definitely have the asari amongst their favourite and most-used kits. From their deadliness on the battlefield, it is easy to see why they are considered amongst the most deadly individual warriors in the galaxy, on par with the krogan Battlemasters.

##Human##

-------------------------------

**Sentinel**

Strengths: Both hardy and agile.  Good reflexes make Sentinels hard to kill.  Throw and Warp combos allow for biotic explosions and cause massive damage.

Weakness: Very few.  Both hard to kill and hard hitting

Good Against: Non-shielded enemies.

Poor Against: Atlas

-------------------------------

**Vanguard**

Strength: Biotic Charge and Nova combos are devastating.  Biotic charge has a lot of utility both as a means of escaping dangerous enemies, but should avoid over-weighting themselves to ensure they will be able to charge in and  out of battle.

Weakness: Biotic Charge and Nova combos can leave Vanguards in very vulnerable situations.  Biotic charge also displaces the Vanguard away from protection provided by the rest of his or her team.  Charging larger distances may expose the Vanguard to unseen enemies(particularly dangerous with hard-hitting ranged enemies like Ravagers and Primes)

Good against: Light enemy clusters.

Poor against: Banshees

-------------------------------
  
**Soldier**

Strengths: Adrenaline Rush instantly refills the soldier's current clip

Weakness:  Concussion shot is relatively weak

Good Against: Most Cerberus Forces

Poor Against: Banshees

-------------------------------

**Adept**

Strengths: Combos are the Adept's bread and butter.  Lightly loaded adepts can chain warp and shockwaves combos

Weakness:  Heavier enemies cannot be lifted by singularity and are largely immune to it. Light enemies surrounding heavier ones allow the adept to overcome this fairly easily.

Good Against: Enemy clusters and light enemies.

Poor Against: Heavy enemies

-------------------------------

**Engineer**

Strengths:  Lightly loaded engineers are a walking force of nature.  Overload allows them to significantly damage shields and barriers

Weaknesses: The Engineer is somewhat vulnerable to numbers, but this hinders his ability to bring down Banshee, Prime and Atlas enemies.

Good Against: Any enemy

Poor Against: Fighting enemy clusters.

-------------------------------

**Infiltrator**

Strengths: Tactical Cloaking is great for completing objectives and rescuing allies in somewhat hard to reach areas, which can devastate enemies as they cross them.  Overall, Human Infiltrators are a great support class.

Weaknesses:  Due to the limited nature of grenades, will largely rely on their weapons, especially sniper rifles, or melee for damage.

Good Against: Light or Armored enemies.  Slow enemies.

Poor Against: Shielded and Barrier'd enemies.

-------------------------------



##Krogan##

------------------------------

**Soldier**

Strengths:  A well balanced Krogan Soldier is devastating to fleshy and armored enemies.  A moderate set of weapons (Either at or below weight capacity), Krogan Berserker(Power Damage), and Incineration Grenades allows the Krogan to initiate Fire Explosions by himself.  Carnage, when specced fully for damage, can devastate brutes and ravagers.  

Weaknesses:  Shielded or Barrier'd enemies need to be worn down a bit with weapons or by allies. Fortification provides excellent damage resistance

Good Against:  Most Reapers and Cerberus Troops.

Poor Against: Barrier'd or Shielded enemies.

Note: Krogan Soldiers and Salarian or Human Engineers make a powerful combo.

-------------------------------

**Sentinel**

Strengths: Krogan Sentinels are incredibly durable

Weaknesses: Lift Grenades come in limited supply

Good Against:  Armored Enemies

Poor Against:  Shielded and Barrier'd Enemies.

&gt;
&gt;**Reach and flexibility are everything you'd want... in a wardrobe.**
&gt;
&gt;The Turian Sentinel's tactical capabilities are well understood and will bear no repetition. But have you ever noticed his impeccable taste in fashion? Have you ever taken in the poise with which he takes cover, because as soon as the bullets flew over your head, and you thought it was safe to take a peek, you exploded.

&gt;**If they weren't soldiers they'd be yuppies.**

&gt;The basic Human Sentinels don't get enough credit. They can shoot, that was the idea. The only tip worth giving: if the guy next to you suddenly turns purple, it's not the time for a group hug. If it's you, I'm sorry to say this, but heaven is a DMV and there is no wireless.
&gt;
&gt;**Don't punch these little guys unless you can punch really hard.** 
&gt;
&gt;From my observations on the battlefield the Volus have a single calling, and no, I hadn't thought about sending bullets into their round, inviting bodies. We just launched sandwhices at them in the hope that they would die of morbid obesity. It was a war of attrition, mostly for our side. We ran out of salami, and their shields kept regenerating.

1372903017.0,1hlvyf,Store Update,InterwebNinja,55,9,35,"Since the last DLC

I've updated my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/178zwt/me_coop_college_408_store/) to reflect everything I know about the store as of now.  If you don't want to reread that whole post

* Best guess for drop rates is 15% in PSPs, while 7.5% in SPs.  SPs have been pretty consistent since we've been measuring them.  There have been some spikes and dips, but it always seems to come back to around 8%.  I'm guessing 7.5% because that would make sense compared to the 15% measured in the other packs.  As of the last DLC, all three of the 99000 packs measured in around 15%, and we have data on more than 1500 of them combined.  The only worry is that these numbers are biased by some sort of day-of-DLC effect.  An UR unlock rate of only 12-13% for these packs would mean they have the same value as SPs.  Anything less than that and they would be a worse value.

* Reserve Packs drop Common Character cards 50% of the time.  That's an effective waste of 100, Arsenals may offer the best value.

* PSPs and SPs still seem to offer the same value for Rare items... if you have an unmaxed Rare manifest.  This effect largely seems to stem from the frequency with which SPs unlock Rare Weapon Mods in the 4th (equipment) slot.  Once Rare Mods are maxed

* Arsenal and Reserve packs appear to offer the best value for Rare Gear.

* Arsenal packs unlock Uncommon items in their third slot at a surprisingly decent rate

Based on all of this, but if you really want to unlock new characters as quickly as possible, they are obviously the best option.

1359839089.0,17rre6,[PC TWEAK GUIDE] How to dismantle your Omnikey!,jongglr8,56,11,37,"*If you want to skip to downloads

*Update 2/3/2013: Introduced the Two-Key methods

***Introduction***

Frustrated because your Human Adept is doing combat rolls instead of reviving the Asari Vanguard? Is running with the pizza too difficult for you?

Unfortunately, the One Key to Rule Them All. We dodge, activate, and sprint with one key. It's functional, but it can become much better if the Omnikey was divided.

*This is when I come in to tell you that your sorrows are over!* Great minds of the internet have discovered a way to divide the Omnikey into many different keys! You can divide them into two keys

***Methods***

* **Two keys** method divide the Omnikey into two keys: Action Key and Use Key. Action Key is used for movements, pizza, and revives. When done manually, this way is much simpler to implement than the three key.

* **Three keys** method divide the Omnikey into three keys: Action Key, except that Action Key no longer allows sprinting; instead, that role is given to the Sprint Key. This method is a bit more complex, but it will give you a slight advantage; it will remove the slight delay between your sprinting command and the actual sprint.

**Both methods require [ME3 Coalesced Utility](http://wenchy.net/me3-coalesced-utility/). [If you edited your FOV](http://www.reddit.com/r/mecoop/comments/14b1ek)

* **IMPORTANT: BEFORE YOU DO ANY OF THESE METHODS

How to back up your Coalesced.bin:

1. Navigate to your Mass Effect 3 directory

2. Make a back up of coalesced.bin. Just copy paste coalesced.bin with a different name.

* **Also

***Two Key Method***

There are two Two Key Methods: T-key Method and Squad Attack Method.

* **T-Key Method: Assigns a new key T as the Use Key. The old Omnikey becomes Action Key**

1. Open ME3Coalesced.exe from your extracted files.

2. Click File

3. Go to your CookedPCConsole folder and open *coalesced.bin*.

4. After it loads, then *sfxgamemodebase*. Click on *bindings = (multiple)*. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/cE7rJMm.png)

5. Find a line that has *Name=""Shared Action*. If you see my previous picture

6. Click on it. It should say *( Name=""Shared_Action""

7. Erase *| Exclusive PressAction*. Make sure that there is one space and a line between *StormOn* and *Ontap 0.3*.

5. Scroll down the right side of the program until you get to the very bottom with an open space with an asterisk (* &lt;- this guy) on the left side. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/KGig3.png)

6. Click the open space, then press enter.

7. Now on the left side of the program, then click on *localizedbindings = (multiple)*. [It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/keAEY8c.png)

8. Same as before, Command=""PC_Use"" )*.

9. Save

* **Squad Attack Method: Assigns Squad Attack as the new Use Key. Old Omnikey becomes Action Key**

1. Follow Steps 1-7 of the T-Key method.

2. Find *( Name=""SquadAttack""* binding.

3. Click on it, then press enter.

4. Save

***Three Key Method***

1. Decide the locations of your new keys. Mine is E for Use Key

2. Start Mass Effect 3

3. Go to Extras

4. Bind your *""Use/Cover/Storm""* to your new Use Key (i.e. I binded mine to E).

5. Make sure that your Sprint and Action Keys are not used by anything else. If they are, is commonly used by *Command HUD (HOLD)*. I rebinded it to Right Shift.).

6. Back out of your options menu

9. Open ME3Coalesced.exe from your extracted files.

10. Click File

11. Go to your CookedPCConsole folder and open *coalesced.bin*.

12. After it loads, then *sfxgamemodebase*. Click on *bindings = (multiple)*. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/cE7rJMm.png)

13. Find a line that has *Name=""Shared Action*. If you see my previous picture

14. Click on it. It should say *( Name=""Shared_Action""

15. Erase EVERYTHING after *Command=""*

16. Scroll down the right side of the program until you get to the very bottom with an open space with an asterisk (* &lt;- this guy) on the left side. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/KGig3.png)

18. Copy paste this baby (without the period of course): *( Name=""PC_Action""

19. Now there's a new blank space with an asterisk. Click on it again

20. Now on the left side of the program, then click on *localizedbindings = (multiple)*. [It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/keAEY8c.png)

21. Same as before, Command=""PC_Action"")*, but in place of Spacebar, enter your key for Action Key. Press Enter.

22. Repeat 21, and in place of LeftShift, your Sprint Key. [Now it should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/Zuz0d7E.png) Now you have binded two keys to Sprint and Action Keys.

23. Click File

1358284026.0,16n25m,ME Co-op College 205: Collectors,spark2,52,6,48,"Introduced in the Retaliation patch, where Harbinger takes over a unit

* **Collector Trooper**: The baseline Trooper level unit, they also can throw grenades to flush you out of cover. When possessed, they gain more health and a layer of barriers, along with the ability to create Collector Webs, which block movement in an area.

* **Collector Captain**: The Collector Captain unit, making groups of them very dangerous. They can also make Seeker Swarms, which sneak up on you and explode, blocking your powers for a set period of time and decreasing weapon accuracy, which is extremely annoying and very dangerous. However, when spawning a swarm, the Captain must stand still and sort of collapse over, they instead create Seeker Plagues, and for their relatively low health

* **Abominations**: A buffed Husk, they're worth it. They will try to enter a grapple animation with you, popping you out of cover and leaving you wide open for attack from other units. They also explode when killed, which can be avoided by destroying the head-- Bioware's version of the old zombie cliché. This can be accomplished by headshots or certain melees-- Batarians, Slayers, Shadows, and Vorcha Heavy melees all work. In addition, negating the explosion. In other words, as their explosion radius increases dramatically along with the damage

* **Scions**: The Collectors' long range unit. These guys are akin to Ravagers or Rocket Troopers, try and help teammates out by taking out Scions that have them pinned down. Alternatively, if they're far enough away, the shots travel slow enough that you can straight up outrun them by running perpendicular to their flight path (thanks AaronEh). Possessed Scions are the most annoying motherfuckers you will ever meet, as not only do they gain extra armor and shielding, but they also become Cover Busters along with Suppressors, which is a bit broken. They fire clusters of grenades at you that explode much more quickly than normal grenades. Rolling/dodging is about your only hope to get out of the way fast enough. They will stagger you, so be careful out in the open. Scions are very slow, which can help free a squadmate from their sync kill if you're lucky and fast (oh yeah

* **Praetorians**: The single toughest enemy in the game, they have the ability to put up a bubble that will block any powers and explosions you throw at them. They can't attack with the bubble up, but they can close in very fast. On that note, Praetorians are about as fast as a Banshee, and would be very hard to hit when moving if they weren't so damn big. Their melee attack is almost always followed by another melee attack, and another, and another, all the better to chomp you with. If you can shoot the plates on their ""face"" off, that has a nasty habit of going through cover and is extremely damaging. Possessed Praetorians are by far the tankiest unit in the game


**STRATEGY/TEAM COMPOSITION**

Weapons classes are by far the best choice against Collectors, making many tech or biotic classes much less good than they are against other factions. In addition, almost every unit is shielded, and *every* unit is shielded when possessed. Biotics are probably your best bet if you're going for power classes, as there are *no* shields, just barriers and armor. For this reason, the Huntress is one of the best classes against them, and because she doesn't rely on explosion damage.

Snipers are your best friend against the Collectors. There is a reason that this faction has been called ""Headshot Heaven"". Collector heads are the proverbial barn door; if you can't hit them, and Troopers and Captains have giant heads. Scions can be staggered by shooting out their sacs, and Praetorians can be weakened by shooting off their plates. Infiltrators are fantastic, as are Turians, thanks to their Stability bonuses letting you get easier headshots. Quarian Marksmen with an accuracy build and a shotgun like the Claymore can wreck Collectors, but need a team backing them up. Destroyers and their accuracy bonuses also make for easier headshots.

The TGI deserves his own special section, Neural Shock applies too. His stability bonus lets him get easier headshots. His dodge makes Abominations, Possessed Scions, and Praetorians much less threatening. His insane weapon damage negates much of the danger of the Praetorian bubbles or Seeker Swarms. The TGI and the Huntress are probably the two best choices for putting the Collectors on (relatively) easy mode.

1357717561.0,168lmh,Why You Should Care For: The Arc Pistol,RepublicanShredder,50,3,49,"For those veterans who have been around since the beginning

Through a series of buffs however

____________________________________________________

*Why did people not enjoy the Arc Pistol?*

**YOU LIE MR. GUN SIR**- The damage shown on the weapon loadout screen implies you have the weapon charged up and thus is not indicative of how the gun actually works. The Arc Pistol has two firing modes: a high-powered charge (shown on the weapon loadout screen) and a low-powered tap (which does a fraction of the given damage).

**Can't even do one job right**- Because of the two firing modes on the same gun

**That's some heavy plastic**- At the time

**Batteries not included?**- And to top it off the Arc Pistol has some ammo problems if fired too fast.

So the Arc Pistol earned its hate. Fortunately it received buffs in terms of relative weight and damage that make it a great caster gun.

___________________________________________________

*So why try the Arc Pistol now?*

**The perfect 200%**- Assuming the Rank 4 Capacity upgrade is taken in the class passive, cooldown with the Arc Pistol while the Carnifex will grant a 190% cooldown. This allows casters to have both a powerful gun AND great cooldowns.

**It's like Trail Mix, respectively.

**Three times three equals...**- When the Arc Pistol shoots a fully charged shot

_____________________________________________________

*Miscellaneous*

**Mods**- I recommend the Barrel and Capacity mods to get the most out of the gun

**You only need one gun**- Because it's both the Carnifex and Predator in one gun

_____________________________________________________

So that's why I encourage you all to give the Arc Pistol another spin. It's like having two guns at once for a caster and it nails the perfect cooldown at X.

### Mechanics

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/u9gss/psa_about_spawning_and_wave_budgets/) is one of the reddit threads on spawn mechanics.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdEJZUFQ0R1pid0JsY25QRUZrbE50QlE&amp;output=html&amp;gid=0) is an excellent spreadhseet that has detailed spawn information organized by faction, and wave.

The main takeaways from these sources:

* Each wave has a fixed budget (e.g. 640 for silver wave 5) and each enemy has a fixed cost (e.g. 20 for an assault trooper).  Enemies spawn until that budget is depleted.

* Each enemy type has a maximum active at once and maximum total which vary based on the wave and difficulty setting.  For instance, and at most 4 during the wave.  In gold, you'll still see no more than 2 active (still exceptions), but there is no cap on the total number seen in the round.

* Killing an enemy unit will cause it to be replaced by the same type of unit

* Objective waves ignore budgets and will continue to spawn enemies until the objectives are completed

* There are a maximum of 8 enemy units on the map at any given time, and drones.

* Each map has a fixed number of spawn locations

* This isn't really relevant to strategy

Given all this information

* *When possible, atlas, prime) are the worst value for getting through the wave quickly.  They take proportionally longer to kill than other equivalent units, relative to their budget cost:  

          Reapers:  1 banshee = 1.4 brutes = 1.7 ravagers = 2.9 marauders = 4 cannibals

          Cerberus:  1 atlas = 1.25 phantom = 2.5 engineer or guardian = 3.3 nemesis or centurion = 4 assault trooper

          Geth:  1 prime = 2.5 hunter

* *Be mindful of spawn locations at the beginning of waves.*  Try to learn where the spawn points are on each of the maps.  (By the way

* *Try to block spawn locations.*  This is an extension of the last point, which in turn can help your team from getting flanked from multiple directions early in the wave.  I will go into more detail on this in the map-specific section.

* *It's okay to retreat.*  When you're swarmed, chances are, there's another place on the map where there are two or fewer.  If you're by yourself and you're starting to get overwhelmed, retreat should be a no-brainer.  Go join your teammates or find a better angle to engage the enemies.  If you're with your teammates and still getting overwhelmed, retreat can be a little harder to orchestrate.  With a mic, it's possible to suggest relocation, but without one, you may be able to draw fire away from your teammates.

* *Killing enemies during some objective rounds can be counterproductive.*  This is particularly true of the device and pizza delivery objectives, chances are it's closer to what you are trying to protect.  Instead, if you are focused on just drawing the fire of the enemies and keeping them away from your teammate, this may be more helpful (at the cost of your precious kill-count).  This is more of an advanced technique, and honestly, if your other teammates are killing things anyway, your pacifism isn't going to be doing much good.  You might just be better off escorting whoever is trying to do the objective (unless it's an infiltrator specced for duration doing devices

* *Kite enemies during the extraction round.*  This is one of my favorites, and draw them away from the EZ without killing them.  I recently had a group of 3 pyros and two hunters following me around Dagger on a wild goose chase, leaving only 3 other spare enemies for the rest of my teammates to fight.  I would only recommend this technique if you are capable of surviving solo, though. And, it's really only helpful on a struggling team, as a solid team should be fine just killing everything they see.

* *Use missiles at opportune times.*  If you know exactly where a group of enemies is going to spawn, at lower difficulties (especially silver), it can be very helpful during a wave 10 objective round.  Since only 4 boss enemies total will spawn during that wave on silver, if you can catch two at a time with a missile, and then 2 more with a later missile, no more will spawn.  This is most useful against banshees, least useful against Atlases.

**Hello again

Over the past couple of weeks now, we, and myself included, have grown more accustomed to what this great class has to offer.  So what will I be going over in this guide you now see before you?

* **New weapons and their strategies**: I'll go over what weapons I've found to be successful
*  **Barrier ""Popping""**: Some of you across MECoOP have probably already seen me suggest this.  I'll go into it a little more in depth
* **Enemy Strategies**: Brought up in comments on the other thread, and what I think you should be doing given certain situations.
* **What Equipment you should be bringing**: While I think I've covered this in my first guide

With that

*DISCLAIMER: THIS GUIDE IS BUILT ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU HAVE FOLLOWED MY PREVIOUS GUIDE AND BUILD SUGGESTIONS, I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO SO TO GET STARTED.*

****
&gt;**Weapons of the Trade**
****

I've said before that my preferred weapon on the Murdertrain is something from the Shotgun category.  You get a bonus from your sixth tier in ""Battlemaster""

**Shotguns**
****
**Graal Spike ~~Thrower~~ Death Dealer**: This gets my vote for the most useful of the shotguns in this catgeory. It's easily one of the most damaging shotguns in the game, the Geth Plasma Shotgun (which we'll cover in a moment), *it's capable of* **headshots**. Meaning more points for you and your team.  I'll recommend ammo later in the EQ section.  With the Capacity and Shotgun Reduction upgrades, this shotgun will still be light enough to not restrict you from being a Murdertrain capable of good recharge (even with Barriers up).  One thing to note, is that unlike the Kishock (another charging weapon), **THIS WILL NOT PIERCE THROUGH COVER OR GUARDIAN SHIELDS** with or without armor piercing OR a shredder mod.  Although, it does look humorous seeing spikes gather on a Guardians shield...

**Geth Plasma Shotgun**: The second cousin of the Graal.  This weapon isn't bad by any means, or whatever is lighter for you (what weapon rank you have).  But for differences, here we go: The GPS, is capable of MORE damage than the Graal, per charge. The GPS has more ammo per Thermal Clip (5) compared to the Graal (3) BUT the GPS uses **2** shots per charge, where as the Graal uses 1.  You will still be able to get 3 charged shots between either weapon, but if you're looking to shoot without charging, but I've read reports that the shredder mod does nothing on the GPS as well.  The accuracy mod isn't needed

**Katana/Scimitar**: Both of these shotguns are light, and found early (usually), that's why I'm comparing them here.  Both shotguns are nothing to scoff at.  But the key differences are that the Katana is a semi-auto (you need to pull the trigger for each shot) and the Scimitar is full auto.  Both are fairly accurate, and I would recommend Damage and Accuracy mods on both to try and get longer range shots for both (the Katana especially).

**Eviscerator**: This one I'm doing separately, than I do the Eviscerator, even though the latter is listed as the ""long range"" shotgun.  I don't know.  If it works for you, by all means, us it.  But from personal experience... It's just... *wrong*... And I don't know what it is that makes it that way.  Damage and Accuracy for best use.
****

Moving on from Shotguns

**SMGs**:
****

**Hornet**: Long has this been a beloved Vanguard weapon.  And it recently got a buff. HOWEVER; I can't in good conscience recommend this one for our Murdertrain. Only because I prefer having something that will deal with enemies at range (at least medium range), using it as a ranged weapon with burst fire isn't great.  Still, it's a good CQC weapon, but we have options for that.

Well why would I recommend a shotgun over the Hornet? A SHOTGUN is a CQC weapon?  My response to that is I've recommended the Graal, accurate as hell shotgun.  It's a hybrid weapon, really.  But I digress.

**Tempest**: The bullet hose.  Or at least, and great for pray and spray.  If ammo is a concern of yours, take this.  It shouldn't be an issue.  Ammo mods for most fun, take damage and clip reduction for efficiency.

**Geth SMG**: The *new* bullet hose. Accurate as hell. And being the only SMG that can use Ultra Lightweight Materials
****
Pistols are up to preference


**Pistols**:
****
**Carnifex**: You know the gun; the Pocket Sniper Rifle. And that's all there is to say about it. Scope and Damage. Simple as that.

**Talon**: If you're lucky enough to have this gun, I would recommend Damage and Piercing.
****
Assault Rifles and Sniper Rifles should be skipped in my humble opinion.  I'm not saying you can't use them, like the Avenger.  The Mattock is a good secondary choice, or even the Vindicator if that floats your boat.  Anything heavier than that is pushing the boundaries effective Cooldown Management.

It should go without saying; If you plan on using something that isn't a shotgun

With weapons out of the way

****
&gt;**Your Barrier and you**
****

The Barrier is a very unique tool.  Since I wrote the guide

* It does *not* detonate Biotic Explosions
* It *can* however *setup* Biotic Explosions
* It has a *very* fast Cooldown (Under 2 seconds)
* It has high damage
* It lifts un**armor**ed/non-boss targets
* It kills Husks up to Silver in one burst
* It ***UTTERLY DESTROYS*** Phantom Barriers
* Ravagers seem to hate Barrier bursts (requires further testing)
* It staggers most enemies (non-bosses)
* It will ALWAYS stagger a Guardian with their shield up

The Lift time on Barrier is probably around 2-3 seconds. 4 at the most.  I'm still trying to figure out if there is ""slam"" damage from the fall.  When a target is Lifted

Phantoms are now cake.  Pop Barrier, don't ignore them. Kill ASAP.*

Guardians aren't so difficult either.  Pop Barrier, Pop Barrier, and they fly away.

The best use you will get out of Barrier is AoE (Area of Effect) damage; when you're surrounded.  It's at these times that you should use barrier over Charge for the faster Cooldown. But pick your battles.  Don't use Barrier pops around Pyros.  Use them around Husks

***CHAPTER 2.1: ENGINEERS***

* The Alliance Navy have a very extensive engineering program that pump out quality engineers

**Human (Class A)** *Rank: Red*

Engineer recruits from various Alliance Training Centres have, traps and turrets. Nowadays, however, Engineers have moved front-and-centre in the battlefield, taking out turrets and personnel alike.

Originally thought to be a quarian-limited schematic, hereto known as the 'Distraction' Drone, is manufactured to be the fifth ally to the Engineer. Many Cerberus troopers can attest how a losing effort has been turned around by a well-placed Cerberus Mass Accelerator Equipped Armoured Turret, and must be aware when our enemy uses similar tactics. Destroying the Distraction Drone may seem like playing directly into our enemy's hands, but this cannot be avoided. Often carrying tracking explosive missiles, an undisturbed Distraction Drone have executed countless numbers of Cerberus agents.

Unlike the Distraction Drone, does not stay by the side of the human class-A Engineer, but is created in the midst of enemy platoons. Quick reflexes must be prevalent in order to silence this machine before it wreaks havoc. Detonation Drones replace their missile-like ordnance for a high-voltage discharge that can seize multiple soldiers' muscles for seconds at at time, an eternity in the middle of a firefight. Treat this Drone as a grenade, as upon 'death', it initiates a self-destruct pulse that can react with various tech abilities used by Engineers as a whole.

Human Class-A Engineers also have omni-tools set for two basic programs, has no projectile and can strip Atlas and Centurion officers' shields as well as Phantom-class specialists' barriers extremely quickly using an immense burst of electrical discharge. Some human Class-A Engineers have focused the electrical current to attack the nervous system, to incapacitate shielded and unshielded hostiles, even through armour's inner insulation. 

Cerberus personnel are advised to stay in cover when hit by either Overload or Incinerate

Centurion officers are encouraged to deploy smoke grenades as soon as a human Class-A Engineer is recognized

**Quarian (Class-A)** *Rank:Red*

Much like the volus

The quarian Class-A Engineer comes pre-loaded with the Incinerate program, only to be shattered by incoming shots. While Cerberus-issued protection has shown to protect the wearer from most of the cold, testing on the hardened armour found on Dragoon protective gear and Atlases have shown that exposing it to extremely low temperatures undermine its shot-blocking abilities. While Cryo Blast is not the most dangerous technique on the battlefield, many casualties were defenseless against follow-up attacks after failing to avoid the icy blast.

Unlike our designs of the Cerberus Turrets, slow bursts and small, quick shots in alternating patterns. Much like a grenade, the compact Turret can be tossed and needs little to no input from the quarian itself. Incoming fire from an unseen Turret have forced many Cerberus frontlines into oncoming fire from Alliance squads. Many quarian Class-A Engineers also outfit these Turrets with devastating flamethrowers, causing mayhem and panic in even the most disciplined platoons and revealing Cloaked Phantom operatives. 'Guardian' shield carrying personnel must take note that these Turrets can also be carrying armour-piercing ammunition that can punch through the shield with astounding frequency.

The quarian Class-A Engineer offsets their susceptible exo-suits with powerful shield generators

**Salarian** *Rank: Red*

These aliens have kept themselves relevant in intergalactic relations due to their staunch dedication to technological advancement. When engaging a salarian Engineer

Incinerate is the most common program running on their omni-tools, so far, slipped through Cerberus' intel nets due to the salarian's dubious extranet policies and planetside networkings. What we have found out is the basic premise of the program, though initial prototypes have yet to have the desired effects. The program infiltrates the salarian's adversary's omni-tool's firewall programs and diverts their shield generator's power to the omni-tool's emitter. This is then encoded by the program itself, and broadcast in a fraction of a second. This energy-laced broadcast is then picked up by the salarian Engineer's omni-tool and sent to its shield generators. Depending on the target, the salarian can drain so much power that its own shield produces a Tech Armour-like layer of protection to reduce the devastation of small-weapons fire.

When faced with insurmountable enemies, and can be easily mistaken for the real thing in the cacophony that is a firefight. It is not advised to approach the Decoy, as most salarian Engineers charge it with enough electrical difference to jump from it to enemies.

**COMPLETED**

**Geth** *Rank: Red*

Ever since the quarian's reacquisition of Rannoch

The geth engineer has modified its optics to switch to a 'Hunter Mode' where, both organic and synthetic, through obstacles such as walls and floors. This also renders our smoke grenades fairly useless, but Centurion officers' are still encouraged to deploy them, since our own helmet optics can see through our chemical blend of smoke and the geth Engineer's allies might not be so lucky. Aside from this, Hunter Mode also sends power directly into the geth's weapon and omni-tool, drastically increasing pellet velocity and program lethality. Some geth Engineers have diverted this power surge to their legs, despite still seeming to walk at a normal pace.

The geth Engineers employ specialized Turrets very similar to the quarian Class-A Engineer's. Intelligence has yet to determine which came first, however the geth Engineer tends to deploy it near itself. The Turret has a specialized emitter that can send overcharged signals directly into its and allies' shield generators, completely restoring them within a set radius. 

The last program on its omni-tool is the commonly seen Overload. While devastating shield generators and barriers

[Here is the build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/GethJuggernaut/LODHR/Lancer1BF5AD5////StrongholdPackage5/)

**Powers**

**Hex Shield Rank 6:** I took Pulse at rank 4, while Large Shield really helps block choke points and gives teammates something larger to hide behind. Its main utility in my experience is blocking Ravager salvos, Atlas shots, and Cerberus turrets. I also pop one down in front of a downed teammate to give them some cover while they get up.

**Siege Pulse Rank 6:** Radius at rank 4, letting you distract more enemies for your teammates to take down. Note that this power also detonates Tech Combos. I'm not sure how powerful of a detonator it is yet, but it seems to be a pretty good one so far.

**Geth Turret Rank 3:** I prefer to keep the turret at rank 3 for some quick shield-boosting without taking more points away from other areas. There is certainly an argument to be made for putting more points into it, so you can spam turrets to keep your teammates' shields up. Remember that the only limit to how far away you can send it is your own knowledge of how to calculate its arc. The arc is very shallow and easy to predict, so if you're new to it just set up a bronze solo on a map with long sight lines and get some practice in.

**Geth Juggernaut Rank 5:** Weapon Damage, also.

**Hardened Platform Rank 6:** Durability all the way. I've heard arguments for taking Squad Command, the 15% damage dealt penalty from the durability upgrade at rank 6 is well worth the extra shields. This turns you into a walking, talking bullet sponge, whose lack of fucks to give is so powerful that every enemy on the map notices it.

**Weapons** I've been flip-flopping between the Lancer and the Typhoon for a bit now. The Lancer frees you from ammo boxes and is lighter, letting you use Siege Pulse more offensively or spamming Hex shield/Geth turret more. However, it doesn't have the sustained-fire or damage capabilities of the Typhoon, which also comes with innate piercing. I notice that I tend to visit the ammo boxes pretty frequently while using the Typhoon, however. Both are good choices, it's just more dependent on how you prefer to play.

**Strategy**

You are a big, you're also not one of those pansy robots that says ""Oh my!"" in a British accent whenever danger appears. Your teammates are your DPS. Your job is to protect them and make sure they can pour uninterrupted streams of fire into the enemies currently attempting to down you. However, BE SMART and DO NOT RELY COMPLETELY ON YOUR HEAVY MELEE TO TANK. Taking on two Banshees is  awesome and badass, but when a pair of Marauders and a Brute show up, you're going to have a really bad day. Pick your battles. Try to isolate a few bosses and, depending on your level of comfort with tanking those bosses, either let your teammates deplete the remaining spawn budget while you keep those bosses occupied, in turn, etc for teammates to shoot at. Plus you can rotate the camera freely while doing heavy melee

On objective waves

**1234 Devices:** Put a shield up in front of the person activating the device and then move away so as not to draw fire to them.

**Hack Circle:** Put up a shield wherever the enemy fire is thickest, Troopers, etc.) Keep your team alive and make sure you have a turret down at all times. In fact, spam that sonuvabitch. Make your teammates sick of hearing that zzzZZ sound it makes when replenishing shields. They'll thank you for it later. Revive downed teammates, and try to make sure the enemies are shooting at the giant robot, not the fragile organics.

**Escort:** Spam turret

**Retrieve: DO NOT FUCKING TAKE THE PIZZA. YOU ARE A ROBOT. YOU DO NOT EAT PIZZA. PIZZA IS FOR FRAGILE ORGANICS.** Just had to make sure that was visible. In all seriousness

**Assassination:** Standard

I think that about covers everything I can think of

**Miscellaneous Notes:**

1. He is not immune to stagger. He can be staggered by bosses on Gold and Platinum. However, and just after his heavy melee cycle and b.) while he is moving sideways (strafing). I noticed this while kiting a pair of Banshees on Platinum. Normally their melee staggers him, but when I started sidestepping (They were attacking from my right side) he no longer got staggered by their melee strikes.

2. Initial ""pulse"" of heavy melee may detonate tech combos. I'm not sure about this one yet

3. His heavy melee appears to have a minimum range. That is, etc when they get right up in my grille with their swords. I have to back away a bit first and then it will Force choke them.

4. Prime cannons appear to be able to penetrate Hex Shield. I've been standing rather far away from my shield when a Prime started firing

5. Hex Shield blocks Ravager shots

6. My personal observations with respect to tankability are based off of Gold/Platinum and generally without ""top-notch"" equipment such as cyclonic mods

7. Don't let packs of Phantoms get close. They'll still ruin your day.

8. If you're playing with another Jugg

That's all I can think of right now

On monday I was playing with 3 friends, because a fourth player joined:

* N7 **9**
* **Drell Adept level 9**
* Pulse rifle + smg

My friends wanted to kick

God damn I had a lot of revives, our Vorcha was also going down quite often (but he was taking down Primes at close range so I thought it was ok). 

It wasn't an easy match

Scores were 90k, since come wave 11 the Drell bolted to the LZ. My time was basically spent running from corpse to corpse, good thing I was playing the perfect class for this: Femquarian Infiltrator w/ Paladin and cloak specced for extra power while cloaked.

1338338188.0,ub9xi,A quick overview of the Ex-Cerberus Vanguard,alaskangamer777,45,2,26,"(This is from an iPhone

Powers:

Lash - This essentially Pull on steroids. At its rank 6 upgrade

Rank 4 - Increase damage by 30% or Increase force and damage of Biotic explosions by 50%

Rank 5 - Increase recharge speed by 35% or do an additional 100% damage over 10 seconds

Rank 6 - 35% chance of no cooldown + increas the timeframe that lifted targets can be detonated by 100% or Penetrate through shields and barriers

Smash - This is the power you've seen in the trailers. You pull out your biotic whips and smash the enemies in front of you. Very effective Phantom killer. You can also upgrade it to set up for biotic explosions or tech bursts

Rank 4 - Add a biotic effect to a target that an be detonated

Rank 5 - Increase force and damage by 40% or Increase recharge speed by 40%

Rank 6 - Increase effectiveness against barriers and armor by 75% or Increase impact radius by 50%

Then we've got Biotic Charge

Now, but they go down very easily. So it's advisable to use fitness to upgrade durability. (You could also upgrade melee damage to be more of a glass cannon)

Their melee is very useful too. Their tap melee is the shock baton that the assault troopers and centurions use

They have a fairly low weight limit

I'm sure that people will come up with multiple playstyles, you can deal out a metric shit-ton of damage, but you may go down a lot if you're not careful.

Sabotage is now crazy good after the buff, it does between 1800-2400 damage from cloak (90% bonus) on non synthetics after 1.5 seconds. I'm not sure how the two bonuses are applied (additive or multiplicative), but it does tons of damage. It's effective against all forms of protection, and it's ridiculous. It takes massive chunks off brutes, ravagers, and banshees. 

The reason why most people won't want to play it?

You will hardly ever place first

It's a great support class too
(1) tech vulnerability gives 100% bonus to everyone else's tech powers on the same target
(2) You're still an infiltrator and can do objectives and revive teammates
(3) You can also hack geth

This was honestly the most fun i've ever had playing ME3. 

The first time this happened was on hydra and we didn't know this would happen, so it was easy to pull this off). The engineer was kind of useless though. Energy drain wasn't very good because only banshees had barreirs. The decoy only attracted like 4 husks out of the hundreds mobbing us. The proximity mines we laid out with the radius buff was really good out wipping out alot of them. We also had concussive shot when they got close. 

The next game it happened again and this time we were ready. The engineer switched to an asari adept and the drell adept switched to a tempest. The drell laid down area reaves and the asari spammed throw. Wiped out alot of husks with biotic explosions. I switched to a Batarian Soldier with Ballistic blades with cone/range/explosion. This time we won.

If this happens to you

If you're in the open, they can't stun you.

If a husk grabs you

Banshees and Brutes are ten times more terrifying

Grenades are great to just throw at your feet to wipe them out. And because you will be running around alot

Only use Full-auto SMGs or ARs. Shotguns

1344598301.0,xzps1,Idea for DLC: Geth Pack!,Cryokina,66,24,88,"This is a random idea I had last night and decided to write up. I present to you six new geth classes


The geth are a humanoid race of networked AIs that were created by the quarians 300 years ago as tools of labor and war. Having since won their freedom from their creators, and deploy tactics as well as any other organic race so long as they stay networked with other geth.


Geth Juggernaut (Soldier):

* Distortion Rocket (Tech ability
* Consensus (Shield
* Chain Grenades (Grenades that produce an arcing electrical effect like some of the evolutions for Overload. Normally affects synthetics. Can be upgraded to affect organics. Primes tech bursts.)
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 1000/1000
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

A more resilient geth unit


Geth Eradicator (Sentinel):

* Shock (Similar to Warp
* Consensus (Shield
* Flechette Armor (Geth equivalent of Tech Armor. Slows down power recharge. Fires spikes over 360 degree radius when detonated. Causes minor bleed damage.)
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 1000/1000
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

The Eradictor excels in combat against organic enemies


Geth Blaze (Infiltrator):

* Tactical Cloak
* Consensus (Shield
* Flamer
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 750/750
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

The Blaze is built to move behind enemy positions undetected


Geth Technician (Engineer):

* Shield Pylon (Deployable pylon. Boosts shields of nearby players. Cannot be deployed at the same time as Assistance Drone.)
* Consensus (Shield
* Assistance Drone (Similar to Tactical Drone. Applies accuracy boosts and more damage to all teammates within range. Drone will follow player who spawned it. Cannot be deployed at the same time as Shield Pylon.)
* SPECIAL ABILITY: Increases speed of devices and hack circles.
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 750/750
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

Geth Technicians are masters of support


Geth Exterminator (Adept):

* Throw
* Consensus (Shield
* Shove (ability that staggers an enemy backwards. Works on health and armour by default
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 750/750
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

Mimicking the abilities of organic biotics


Geth Annihilator (Vanguard):

* Biotic Charge
* Consensus (Shield
* Slam
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 1000/1000
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

Mimicking the abilities of organic biotics, geth units fight more effectively when several work in proximity.


Maps:

* Firebase Remnant (City on Rannoch. Wide open map
* Firebase Orbital (Geth space station near Perseus Veil. Small map


Guns:

* Geth Plasma Pistol: Similar to Arc Pistol
* Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle: Same as in Firefight Pack. Ultra-Rare level.
* Blood Pack Punisher: Same as in Firefight Pack. Gold level.

The Retribution Pack will also change various details

* A mention of how the medi-gel used to revive geth contains restorative nanobots.
* Damage screens for geth changing to flickering HUDs and electronic noises instead of blood.
* Change in dialogue from ""Cover this one!"" to ""Cover this unit!"" (that always bugged me
* That goddamn bug where you can fire the Reegar and a power at the same time.


And that's all! Let me know how you like it




EDIT: Okay

* Tougher Vanguard.
* Decided Lift was overpowered
* Nerfed Consensus so that it doesn't result in ME3 Multiplayer turning into Geth-o-rama.",self,t5_2tkk1,1344621730.0,,Reaper,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xzps1/idea_for_dlc_geth_pack/

**Quarian Female Engineer**

*Why is it outclassed?*

* With three powers that have very limited usefulness, highlight targets for better team cooperation, better damage bonus, and similar slow effect), and the best, most versatile grenade in the game to date along with the shared Incinerate. It was able to pull the same support debuffs, with better versatility towards all enemy groups.

*How to fix it?*

* Cryo Blast has a sizable armor debuff. Usually, whether that is a high damage per shot weapon or with AP ammo or a mod. A fully specced cryo blast will add an extra 25 damage per shot against armored targets, which usually isn't a sizable amount for the most common weapons on Gold and Platinum. There is a way to take advantage of this; Shotguns. Shotguns get that bonus for each pellet for a damage boost against armored targets to 200 for each pull of the trigger. Even on the Claymore this is a 16% damage increase against armor. On the Talon I, its a 76% increase. This allows to maximize weapon damage, and make the class a monster against Reapers.

*Builds*

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#21NARNRq9@0@A@@@0@0@0@0

* This is focused on debuffing armor, so it's easy to get caught up in just saying the gun is good, but it takes the most advantage of Cryo Blast's armor debuff. It gets an extra **500 dps** against armored targets. Although any shotgun, or even the Hurricane can take great use of it. Since all damage is done by the weapon, focused on those evolutions. Turret is useful as a distraction and for some token damage.

or

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#21DKRIRS0@0@A@@Z4I4@0@0

* This is a bit more power based with Incinerate. So a high level piranha, but also incorporates Incinerate for burst damage instead of the turret. I'm not positive if the Freeze Combo works against armored targets, but the class still functions much the same way. You could spec out turret, but just as a general rule I don't prefer builds that force a spec card. 

**Krogan Sentinel**

*Why is it outclassed?*

* The big bad Destroyer and Demolisher came along and took the Krogan's uniqueness as the only common heavy weapon, and does more damage. 

*How to fix it?*

* The one thing the Destroyer can not do is tank the sheer amounts of damage that the Krogan can, you're essentially invincible. 

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#32RALLO@0@0[A@@@0@0@0@0

* You can tinker with the specifics of the build with the use of gear. There's three ways you'll be doing damage: Weapon (I generally prefer a shotgun), Martial Biotic, Shock Trooper, Grenade Capacity, Berserker or Hydraulic Joints are all pretty decent options based on how you prefer to do damage in those three ways, although I personally prefer Shock Trooper/Warfighter. 

**Salarian Infiltrator**

*Why is it outclassed?*

* It's hard to call what was at one time considered to be the best class in the game outclassed. The SI really isn't outclassed

*How to fix it?*

* The Geth (and Quarian male to a lesser degree) do best with close range weapons. The Geth because it can take deadly advantage with Hunter Mode, and when at close range. Also, headshots are important, especially for the Valiant to pick up those 1 hit kills on mobs. Incendiary ammo is my ammo of choice for snipers for the bleed over during the down part of your cloak cycle, and sets up the rare fire explosion when you get kills with ED or Prox mine.

I've done Platinum solos with both Soldiers
So
Not surprising

The other two don't take Overload or max out Overload.

My original spec was 6/6/6/4/4 and then I used 3/6/6/5/6 for my Platinum solo.
But after some reflection I've evolved my build again.  This is the current spec here:

[**5/5/6/6/4**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/Turian/IJPNF/Claymore10AO5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3/AdrenalineModule3/ShotgunAmp5/)

[**Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIDUBz54ZZw)

**Tech Armour**
-----

Tech Armour fills two roles on this character.  First it increases our effective shields with it's 40% DR
Combined with original Turians high base shields it lets us eat a few more shots if we can't duck behind a corner or get into cover.
Detonating

Second

**Warp**
-----

Warp is used for primarily debuffing bosses.  The Expose evolution increases the damage done by powers and weapons which includes ammo powers.
That is substantial
Warp, Warp, reload cancel, and shoot again.
And

**Overload**
-----

It's the penultimate shield and barrier stripping power in the game.  With our evolutions we get 6x multiplier vs robots and **8x** against organics.
This is critical to our survival as we haven't had Reaper tech implanted in our ankles and cannot dodge.  Maximum single target damage is required to stay alive in one on one battles with Phantoms.
If they slash you chances are you'll end up on the floor for the remainder of the round.  To counter
Gold Phantoms have 3075 barriers our Overload does 3168 damage to organics shields - their barriers are gone in one cast and with precision they are dead a second later.
Otherwise

**Turian Veteran**
-----

In my opinion the owner of the best weapons passive tree in the game.  And

**Fitness**
-----

We are allowed up to rank 4 in durabilty and that gives us a pretty high 1200 shields.


Ammo Powers
-----

I generally prefer to use Warp Ammo to leverage the bonus to lifted targets you'll get from casting Warp.
Incendiary also works well with lighter weapons like the Harrier or Wraith that allow use of powers more often to detonate Tech Combos.
This build is not particularly suited to Warp/Incendiary bug abuse because we do not have Pierce.

Armour Slot
-----

I prefer Adrenaline module to offset the slow base speed of Turians.
Shield Power Cells

I prefer weapon amps in the gear and weapon slot.  They synergize well with Expose and the more base damage you have the better Expose is.

**Loadout**
-----

I generally run the Claymore (Choke and HVB) or Harrier (AR Piercing and Magazine).
Other good choices could be the Wraith

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdDRJMDY5U1JGX1J4R2F1MzNsRjhnZ3c&amp;output=html&amp;gid=2) is a spreadsheet that has the damage of all the enemy attacks.

The question I am wondering is when is it worth putting extra points into Fitness

Here are my takeaways:

* Shields / Health of 600 or less are basically just Shield / Health gate
* Shields / Health of 990 are enough to absorb a Banshee Warp
* Shields / Health between 600 and 990 will see mixed results - some lower-tier attacks will drop shields
* Shields / Health of 1150 will absorb a full volley from an Assault Trooper, Marauder, Geth Trooper, and Collector Trooper.  It will also absorb 2 Engineer shots, 1 Guardian shot, or 1 Hunter shot.
* Shields / Health of 1500 will additionally absorb a Geth Rocket
* You need roughly 2000 and 2500 Shield / Health to absorb an Atlas and a Nemesis shot

This probably won't affect the way I approach too many builds, it may make a difference.  ~~Getting over the 1150 bump should actually make a noticeable difference in survivability.~~  (edit:  this was not phrased well.  There is no magic threshold that is going to yield an immediate boost in durability, but I would say that based on my subjective experiences, shields in the range of the low 1000s yield good survivability).

And, that is sufficient to get you ~~over that 1150 hump~~ in that low 1000s range.

You have to stand near the probe in order for the probe to move. I think that if more of your team that stands in the circle of the probe's radius

So it's get in the circle around the prob and follow it to the extraction zone. I don't think you have to worry about the probe being destroyed by enemies. We had some banshees on us but they didn't mess with the probe

Now, but if you want to remap your keys for your Talon you have to do this again. With that said, I have had very much success with this fix.

1. Download the Coalesced utility which you can get here: http://wenchy.net/me3-coalesced-utility

2. Backup the file we're going to be changing. Locate your Origin Games folder (should be in program files

4. Open up your coalesced editor utility (the program you downloaded earlier) and hit File --&gt; Open

5. Now go to bioinput.ini --&gt; sfxgame --&gt; sfxgamemodedefault --&gt; bindings. When you hit ""bindings = (multiple)"" some text will appear in the right part of the window. These are the default key bindings. 

6. What you want to do is edit the part where it says e.g Name=""One"", Two, Three, Four, etc.. Also there are no spaces. So if you want one to bind to left alt you have to make it Name=""LeftAlt"". You can see which command it binds to by looking at the Command=""commandhere""

**Hex Shield**




* Rank 4 - Strength

* Rank 5 - Shock

* Rank 6 - Damage Synergy







Hex Shield is a key power for you as the Tank.  It is your cover in open areas and your second layer of shields in an enclosed space.  Deploy it against boss enemies







**Siege Pulse**



* Rank 4 - Radius

* Rank 5 - Damage Protection

* Rank 6 - Number of Shots



Your other bread and butter power.  Additional Damage Protection from the Rank 5 evolution and Rank 6 additional shot.  This makes you even more of a tank.  The Radius gives you better crowd control against mooks.





**Geth Juggernaut**



* Ran 4 - Weapon Damage

* Rank 5 - Power Damage and Force

* Rank 6 - Weapon Damage



With the two powers we are specced into not being damage powers






**Harden Platform**


* Rank 4 - Durability

* Rank 5 - Recharge

* Rank 6 - Power Transfer





You are a tank


Ignore Sentry Turret.  Doesn't do enough and it will never be as good as a Prime's turret.



**Weapons and Gear**


Good weapons to use are

* M-7 Lancer

* Harrier

* Prothean Particle Rifle

* Typhoon


Use of backup pistols or sniper rifles is not bad either.  I'm partial to the CSR,  Shield Booster, Stronghold Package, or any gear that ups Assault Rifle damage/stability/thermal clip capacity are all good choices.  Have not tried Batarian Gaunlets since I did not unlock that yet, but they sound hilarious to slap on him.



**Difficulties**


On silver and below, stand in the open and don't give a shit.

On Gold be more careful of your choices and engaging the enemy.  Anything smaller than a scion, and Atlases.  Drop the Hex Shield and back slowly away, and do not use Siege Pulse against it.  You want all 4 charges on your shoulder to maximize Damage Protection.   Heavy Melee whenever possible to recharge your shields, you can stand against anything if you time things right.  If your team mates are smart they will stick around you and use you as a decoy.  The dumb ones run off and go down.  Don't bother trying to reach them, you can't, you're too slow.  You can easily pull a 100k score on gold playing smart.








**EDIT:**  Did more testing.  This guy is the most serious guddam tank ever.  As for the war of Turret vs Hex Shield, 1 Brute, 3 Geth Pyros and 2 Hunters on Plat all at once.  The 925 shields restore of a maxed Hardened Platform Heavy Melee is godlike when you have 4600 shields and a Shield Booster on for an additional 1400 shields.  Heavy Melee the shit out of everything that gets close.  Banshees are not even a problem for the Juggernaut.  M-7 Lancer is by far one of the best guns on him, unless you hump a ammo box with a Harrier, but even a Lancer I compares well to a Harrier VI from my experience.",,False,t5_2tkk1,True

First off

- Dragoons are essentially the Cerberus equivalent of a Geth Pyro. They're ever-advancing armoured targets that try to get up in your grill so they can unleash their devastating close range attacks. **You do not want this.** Smash will stagger you

- Dragoons spawn (on Gold) on waves **3, 7 and extraction** - remember that so you can plan accordingly.

- Dragoons also **move in packs** like Pyros

- **Dragoons can't be grabbed.** Or at least

- On top of that

So these guys are **high priority** targets. You see a Dragoon in your FOV, they're essentially just Assault Troopers with armour and a considerably lesser threat, but again, don't think this means you can leave them be; you do not want them getting close to you. Take advantage of this. There are numerous ways to temporarily immobilise a Dragoon and stop them from ever getting within lethal distance. They're susceptible to **stuns from electric attacks** such as Overload, Submission Net, Disruptor Ammo, and **staggers from projectile powers**.  As they're armoured, so you can use that as another tool to hinder their assault. As long as you can do that much

Okay, and lots of them. While in their Smash animation they have a **high stagger threshold** - from what I can tell without any numbers, it's about equivalent to Phantoms. That means you need an on-demand stagger weapon or power to interrupt their carnage. **Biotic Charge, Havoc Strike, Proximity Mine, Geth Plasma Shotgun, M-37 Falcon, try and stagger them, so sometimes the best tactic is to move to cover at a safer distance to pick them off. Don't stay in one place too long though or you'll most likely end up getting flanked by either more Dragoons or Phantoms. They force you to keep moving and stay alert. And don't try going toe to toe with them unless you're packing some serious heat because with the new health gate mechanics they will kill you fast.

That's pretty much all I have to say about Dragoons for now, you should be good.

*Weight*: 1.5


The Katana is (as befits the default weapon) the most traditional shotgun. It has a relatively high capacity, but like the Avenger, that can be as much a strength as a weakness since in turn it has no crippling flaws (other than range, as befits a traditional shotgun). However, the lack of range really does prevent this from being the main weapon of most classes, while the weight is a hindrance as a sidearm. Traditional shotgun classes (Vanguards, shotgun infiltrators, though there are arguably better options.



**Scimitar**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 35.4

*Clip Capacity*: 8

*ROF*: 100

*Burst DPS*: 589

*Sustained DPS*: 384

*Effective Range*: Close

*Weight*: 1.5


The Scimitar does less damage per shot than the Katana but trades this for a larger thermal clip and much improved fire rate. In fact, mainly lack of range/utility and relatively high weight for a secondary. It also has a significantly longer reload time than the Katana (almost double), meaning you need to be wary of your clip before charging in headlong.



**Eviscerator**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 60

*Clip Capacity*: 3

*ROF*: 48

*Burst DPS*: 479

*Sustained DPS*: 342

*Effective Range*: Close-Mid

*Weight*: 1.5


On paper the Eviscerator is one of the weaker shotguns. However, has Assault Rifle damage range statistics. This means it suffers far less damage dropoff over range than other shotguns (excepting the Graal, Crusader, and GPS). The accuracy bonus from a smart choke can actually give this gun carnifex/saber level precision (provided you get used to aiming with the shotgun circle). This means that it has more utility than both the Katana and Scimitar, as it can engage targets at any range. This makes it a safe primary weapon choice for most classes, though power spammers will still want to be wary of the weight. This utility comes at the cost of a tiny thermal clip (only three shots, though it has a fast reload) and overall damage (though this can be made up for with the higher headshot potential). Overall a solid choice



**Wraith**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 89.5

*Clip Capacity*: 2

*ROF*: 48

*Burst DPS*: 716

*Sustained DPS*: 448

*Effective Range*: Close-Mid

*Weight*: 1.5


Effectively the same as the Eviscerator with more damage and even less capacity. In most situations



**Disciple**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 46.3

*Clip Capacity*: 4

*ROF*: 75

*Burst DPS*: 578

*Sustained DPS*: 338

*Effective Range*: Close

*Weight*: 1


The Disciple is the best sidearm shotgun, but also the combination of a low thermal clip (4 rounds) and a high reload time (2.27 seconds). This combines to give it a disappointingly low sustained damage output (lowest of any shotgun). Still, when used as a fallback weapon to quickly eliminate close range enemies, it's high fire rate and damage give it solid burst. This will likely be the shotgun of choice for any class using long range weapons who want a low weight answer to enemies looking to invade their personal space.



**Claymore**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 167.8 (no

*Clip Capacity*: 1

*ROF*: 64 (however

*Burst DPS*: 1

*Sustained DPS*: 470

*Effective Range*: Close

*Weight*: 2.5


The claymore is the epitome of what most people think of as a shotgun. It is huge, bar none. The fact that it uses pellets means that this weapon can actually oneshot shielded enemies on gold (all shotguns can, but this one is most likely to do so). Of course, being the epitome of a shotgun means it also exemplifies all of their crippling weaknesses. The reload time is a whopping 2.57 seconds, meaning that you need to make every shot count. If you don't oneshot your opponent, you've got three seconds of helplessness (short of reload canceling) during which they can return fire at you. The high weight is also problematic for any class that values short cooldowns (read: everything except soldiers). Vanguards will want to stay away due to the weight but shotgun infiltrators can pair the already massive damage with their tactical cloak bonus for truly disgusting amounts of burst.



**Crusader**


*Damage (slug)*: 353.7

*Clip Capacity*: 4

*ROF*: 80

*Burst DPS*: 589

*Sustained DPS*: 393

*Effective Range*: Mid-Long

*Weight*: 2.5


The crusader is a shotgun that is not a shotgun. If anything, it fires VERY accurately and rather quickly. It's hard to compare this to other shotguns because it fills a very different role, but altogether I'd say it's not very effective. The Saber/Carnifex fill the same niche as the Crusader with significantly less weight, higher capacity, and approximately the same DPS. If you want a long range shotgun, go with the GPS, Graal



**Geth Plasma Shotgun (GPS)**


*Damage (slug-esque)*: 714.2

*Clip Capacity*: 5

*ROF*: 60

*Burst DPS*: 1

*Sustained DPS*: 943

*Effective Range*: Mid-Long

*Weight*: 2


The GPS is a crowd favorite at the moment and it's not hard to see why. It has a very high burst DPS and the highest sustained DPS out of any shotgun. The projectiles, enabling huge burst potential (as an infiltrator, make sure to cloak AFTER you begin to charge, otherwise charging will cancel cloak). This means you can unload the entire clip at an enemy for high burst damage or fire slower, more damaging shots to deal with armor (just keep in mind charged shots use 2 units of ammunition). However, this weapon has two crippling weaknesses which (in my mind) put it behind the Graal as the best main shotgun. Firstly, it cannot headshot (or get bonus damage from any weak spot, as the headshot damage multiplier is brokenly strong. This means that despite doing superior damage per shot, this weapon cannot penetrate shields on Gold as other shotguns can. Still



**Graal Spike Thrower**


*Damage (per flechette)*: 80

*Clip Capacity*: 3

*ROF*: 80

*Burst DPS*: 1

*Sustained DPS*: 747

*Effective Range*: Any

*Weight*: 2


The Graal is the second 'god tier' shotgun, when aiming the spread is basically pinpoint. The main drawback is that the projectiles are not hitscan and lack the tracking of the GPS energy rounds, meaning you need to be able to lead properly to hit targets at range. Once you've mastered that, however, you've got a shotgun that can obliterate anything close range while still maintaining the accuracy and damage potential of most sniper rifles. Like the GPS, each shot can be charged prior to cloaking for incredible burst or in order to better deal with armor. Ultimately this is my favorite choice for any class that would main a shotgun, especially shotgun infiltrators.

**Volus** *Rank: Green*

The miniscule volus have created combat-approved exo-suits and have joined our enemies in their campaign. After mastering the asari technique of Stasis

Killed-in-action statistics have shown an alarming number of Centurion-class officer deaths at the hands of volus enemies. Often, angry volus. Shield Boost is the revolutionary technology developed by volus scientists and, as of yet, unattained by Cerberus intelligence. With a press of a button, the volus can recharge their own combat shielding *as well as their allies'*. Squadrons have been absolutely devastated by an Alliance team of this volus with a large, aggressive unit such as the Geth Class-B Soldier known as the 'Juggernaut' or the Warlord Krogan Class-B Sentinel.

Upon discovering a volus basic training vessel hidden in the asteroid belt of the Aru system, the volus' exo-suit's cooldown function is only applied to creating the orbs themselves. Cerberus troops are advised to count the number of orbs surrounding a volus Adept, much like they count shots before heat clip ejection in enemy armament, and to engage when the volus runs out. Often times, volus Adepts leech the Orbs' power directly into the exo-suit, speeding up other abilities' cooldown times and increasing the strength of their shielding. 

* Battlefield vids have yet to show any kind of melee fortitude with volus combatants. Phantom- and Dragoon-class operatives have standing orders to engage volus Adepts

**Krogan** *Rank: Red*

The krogan Adept is an extremely unusual adversary. Normal krogan tactics are ineffective and sometimes dangerous to use against the Adept. Often, the krogan Adept lets loose a Shockwave that blows them back and executes them one by one. 

The loose commands of taking down Adepts filter down to focused fire to bring down their weak barriers and flank as needed, the krogan Adept shrugs off small arms with the ability to divert biotic power into its Barrier to decrease sustained fire against the beast. 

Instead of the krogan killbox configuration, have personnel equipped with the M96-Mattock semiautomatic rifle or the M-358 Talon shotgun revolver fire directly in front of the target. Krogan have evolved in such a way that their eyes are on either side of their head, to prepare for attacks from the side and above, leaving a small gap directly in front of them that is similar to our peripheral vision. This approach is extremely high risk for high reward for Phantom- and Dragoon-class specialists. If you manage to sneak in, the krogan is in serious trouble, but if you get close to an enemy krogan, he'll charge. You don't want that.

**Batarian** *Rank: Red*

Before Cerberus launched our full-scale war on the Alliance Navy and its allies

These four-eyed barbarians carry Cluster Grenades, as said Warp can drastically affect their armour's durability.

It seems our back-stabbing deserters have also divulged their secrets to alien races, for those who have proven to need a shield, do not think it will negate Warp's danger completely.

Additionally, or even disintegrating Collector Praetorians after sustained fire. There is only one way to stop the batarian Enforcement Gauntlet, and that is to not be in range when it is deployed. Cerberus engineers have determined that servos in the Gauntlet lock the batarian's armour that renders small-arms fire almost useless. What baffles the engineers completely is the batarians ability to track an enemy for meters during the initial wind-up. Even when the target is knocked away, intentionally or not, batarians have managed to travel tens of meters to execute their target.

Due to their close-range aptitude, as batarians can be eliminated with the anti-personnel cannon as well as the Atlas' multi-function hydraulic claw.

**Collector** *Rank: Further Analysis Needed*

In faraway systems, but these findings have baffled even our most seasoned indoctrination experts. 

From the extremely limited amounts of reconnaissance attaining to these Adepts, it won't be happening. If you do see these weapons 'reloading', do not hesitate. Do not think, engage and empty your clip. This is your chance to take it out.

Their biotics are strange and surprisingly strong. Upon their first appearance, but these reports have not been confirmed.

Some Collector Adepts have also thrown a large, and had no cooldown whatsoever. We have recorded these Adepts throwing this sphere immediately before using Dark Channel. Sometimes, the Reave-ball has detonated, often taking out unshielded enemies that are almost 7 meters away from the impact point. Phantom-class operatives are warned that this sphere can short out your Tactical Cloak and nullify the invisibility it grants you.

**LEVEL EPSILON CLEARANCE ACCEPTED: REDACTED TEXT UNSCRAMBLED**

One vid, a Collector Adept seemed to become 'Possessed' as other hostile Collectors are prone to do. Instead of a fiery orange glow, the Adept took on an eerie green one, that made it an easy target. Judging by how the Collector moved and the noises it made, gunfire seemed to be very effective. It seldom left cover while 'possessed'. 

Then

Cerberus training instructors have yet to apply an effective attack strategy on these Adepts. Centurion officers have free reign to engage as they see fit. Troopers are encouraged to take these 'unchained' Collectors alive,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1376347677.0,,Xbox,t3_1k4ukl

Ammo powers are consumables that add special effects to the shots fired from all equipped weapons. They range in rarity and effectiveness and can be obtained from packs purchased in the store.

For most ammo powers that deal extra damage

For ammo powers that apply an effect

Certain ammo powers can also set up tech combos. However

Ammo power descriptions consist of:

* *Effect:* The core effect of the ammo power

* *Damages:* If the ammo power deals damage

* *Application:* What situations this ammo power is good for

**AMMO POWERS**
---

**ARMOUR PIERCING AMMO**

*Effect*: Provides a high amount of armour penetration and moderate cover penetration. Deals immediate bonus damage based on weapon damage.

*Damages:* Health

*Application*: Great ammo power for any rapid fire weapons or multi pellet weapons like shotguns because of how important AP is for those weapons. Using this ammo power can free up an extra weapon mod slot for other purposes. 

**CRYO AMMO**

*Effect:* Weakens armour DR

*Damages:* N/A

*Application:* This ammo can be good with AoE weapons like the Falcon or the Scorpion for massive application of the slowing effect and the setting up of cryo explosions. If armour weakening is being sought after

**DISRUPTOR AMMO**

*Effect:* Delays enemy shield regen by 8 seconds. Has a chance to stun lesser enemies and also set up tech bursts. Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage which has a 4x multiplier against barriers and shields.

*Damages:* Health

*Application:* This ammo is great for stripping shields with in certain cases can overcome shield gating for sniper rifles. The stun effect of the ammo is potent CC and the ammo has a good chance to set up tech bursts.

**INCENDIARY AMMO**

*Effect:* The core effect of this ammo is that each shot also applies a 3 burning DoT based on weapon damage, the DoT effects stack up on each other and do not actually tick until the gun stops being fired. This results in ridiculous burning damage on a target with rapid fire weapons. The ammo power also has an interaction with warp that leads to even crazier amounts of damage.

For a more in-depth look and an example

*Damages*: Health

*Applications*: Incendiary ammo can create some devastating combinations on the battlefield. The infamous incendiary ammo+Reegar carbine combo is one of the most potent setups in the game and can melt bosses in mere seconds. It is recommended that classes like incinerate and flamer not be used with this ammo power as their DoTs interfere with the ammo DoT.

**WARP AMMO**

*Effects:* Weakens armour. Deals significant bonus damage to targets based on weapon damage and deals even greater amount of damage (in addition to the base effect) if the target is primed for a biotic explosion. 

*Damages:* Health

*Applications:* Widely regarded as one of the best ammo powers, reave, or dark channel. The extra bonus against barriers also makes it a great choice when dealing with Collectors due to the commonality of barriers.

**PHASIC ROUNDS**

*Effect*: Delays shield enemy shield regen by 15 seconds. Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage and has massive multipliers against shields and barriers.

*Damages:* Health

*Applications:* Phasic rounds are one of the best choices for high burst

**DRILL ROUNDS**

*Effects:* Offers moderate armour penetration and high cover penetration. Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage.

*Damages:* Health

*Applications:* This ammo is commonly used in wall-hacking playstyles, and Recon mine) to hit enemies before they even come into line of sight. It is best used on weapons that have innate cover penetration as otherwise the weapon will suffer heavy cover penetration damage penalties.

**EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS**

*Effects:* Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage up to a cap in a delayed explosion. Explosion cannot occur until the weapon stops firing on the target.

*Damages:* All

*Applications:* Explosive are seen by many as difficult to make good use of. The damage is delayed and also not very strong meaning there are often better choices. However since the explosion has a strong chance to stagger enemies,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1363364145.0,,,t3_1acpku

1351129318.0,121iek,Asari Terrorist Martyr [Asari Valkyrie build],CatboyMac,43,3,24,"**BACKSTORY**

In 2179, staged what would come to be known as the deadliest terrorist attack ever perpetrated on Earth by a foreign sapient species. Using an odd combination of advanced combat armor and powerful biotics, she was able to detonate both herself and objects around her while remaining impervious to harm. Her infamous campaign across the city of Istanbul was finally put to a stop when local law enforcement managed to kill her before she could prime her armor to detonate over the steps of the Hagia Sophia. 17,274 lives were lost that day, sparking bitter debate in Citadel space on the effects of human culture on the galaxy at large, and the threat it represented to Asari cultural hegemony.

In her personal manifesto, and claimed to feel disillusioned by the accepting and culturally moderate nature of Earth's Muslim population. While social scientists and religious fundamentalists argued over what the lengthy manifesto says for religion and humanity as a whole, military engineers and PMCs across the galaxy combed over her notes in an attempt to recreate the potent and destructive power she had unleashed upon the world.

**Class:**

Asari Valkyrie

**Power Evolutions:**

* Tech Armor: Damage and Radius (4)

* Warp: Detonate (4)

* Annihilation Field: Damage (4)

* Asari Valkyrie: Damage and Capacity (4)

* Fitness: Durability (4)*

*(If you're feeling reckless

**Weapons:**

Try to keep cooldowns above 150% and stick to either high-DPS weapons like the Talon/Carnifex or utility weapons like the Acolyte/Scorpion. I personally switch between the acolyte and Talon

You can also use the Disciple Shotgun to stagger and stun enemies while waiting for Warp's cooldown to end

**Gear:**

You live and die by your cooldowns, as this is a reckless build with a steep learning curve, and many teammates are likely to die trying to rescue you.

**Strategy:**

At the beginning of every round, hit them with warp while the annihilation field is primed, finish them off with your weapon if they still alive, and find cover if there are more enemies nearby. For boss characters, run up to them so that they are primed with AF, use warp to trigger and explosion, dash away, and repeat. Once you get the hang of this you will spam explosions like spitfire. unlike the N7 Fury,,False
1350405525.0,11ks3x,Archangel: Turian Ghost Sniper,ginja_ninja,39,0,45,"By now most of you should know how dominant of a character the ghost is with assault rifles. My weapon of choice with him is a harrier and he absolutely tears any enemy apart on gold.

However

Here is the build I'm currently using that gives me the option to switch back and forth with an assault rifle loadout: [Ghost Mk. III](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#46LRDHQg7@0PE@@P4Q4@0@0)

Here is the build I would recommend for someone with no interest in using assault rifles that wanted to snipe 100% of the time: [Sniper Ghost Mk. I](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#46LJDNQg7@0PE@@P4Q4@0@0)

If you spec your overload correctly, and it was strong enough to take down all of cerberus' shields, but came up short against geth hunters and pyros. Switching to chain/neural/shield reduces the overall base damage of the power, but increases the damage it does against shields compared to the previous spec, making it powerful enough to fully eliminate the stronger geth shields.

The javelin feels perfect on this guy. It boasts the highest damage of any sniper rifle, I cloak &gt; overload &gt; fire &gt; reload cancel &gt; fire &gt; reload cancel with cloak &gt; overload &gt; fire &gt; etc.

Finally

So yeah, I always use the harrier against them, but I imagine there wouldn't be too many problems. This definitely is not the most powerful build for the class and I think assault rifles are a better all around choice for him, but this playstyle is an extremely fun and totally viable alternative for people looking to play a style closer to their disfigured mantis bro from single-player.

1346187087.0,yzcd1,The Biotic Throwdown 2: Acolytric Throwgaloo,ginja_ninja,41,5,42,"So many of you will probably remember my [double-stuf-wall-of-text human sentinel thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/t1k15/the_biotic_throwdown_indepth_human_sentinel/?sort=confidence) from a few months ago. You will remember sentinel has been my favorite class since owning husks at lightspeed on the derelict reaper in ME2. However

Human sentinel buff aside (I'm talking about the 30% power damage bonus tech armor has now, a lot of the recent metagame changes have come in the form of the new weapons classes being able to claim superiority over the powers classes when they deck themselves out in weapon amps, level IV ammo, etc. Up until literally yesterday, for the most part I agreed with it. Asari adept, drell adept, human sentinel and the like used to effortlessly rule over the infiltrators, and soldiers without even having to equip consumables 2 or 3 months ago. But today we live in the age of destroyers

It seemed as if the sun had set on my human sentinel. I would still take him out for a spin once every few days, and my favorite ability in the entire Mass Effect series, throw, was for the most part relegated to a biotic explosion detonator.

No more. **Do you hear me? NO. MORE.** The age of throwing is upon us, a weapon that I have seen receive very little recognition on this subreddit: the Acolyte.

You see

I'm going to say that again just to emphasize this for human sentinel players who didn't jump for joy out of their chairs the first time: **a single shot completely removes the shields of any enemy that isn't an atlas or a geth prime on gold.**

The new strategy for human sentinel: shoot with acolyte, hunters, nemeses, marauders, combat engineers? Remember when you had to go through all that bullshit to prime and detonate a biotic explosion on each one just to kill them? **SHOOT WITH ACOLYTE, THROW.** The enemy is now dead. Move on to the next one.

I used to think human sentinel wasn't viable for going up against gold cerberus because asari adept was so much better vs. phantoms because she had stasis. Yeah. Shoot with acolyte

Remember how it used to take forever to get through the shields of atlases and geth primes with your biotic explosions? Remember how shields used to be the hard counter to biotic classes? Yeah, be it asari adept, N7 fury, drell adept, whatever. An acolyte with extended barrel and extended mag (which to my knowledge are the only 2 mods that even do anything on this weapon) can take down the shields of an atlas or prime in a single clip without even having to stop to reload. So yeah, they can enjoy the 5 seconds or so they have shields before you shred their armor with warp/throw explosions.

In fact, acolyte shots stagger the target, guaranteeing they won't be able to dodge-roll your throw (as if it wasn't good enough already). I hope you've all taken the top 3 options for 4-6 on throw ladies and gents, because you want to have the highest chance that your throw is going to one-shot the poor sap you just hit with an acolyte so you can move onto the next victim as quickly as possible like I did in the 10 or so rounds I dominated with my new and improved beast-mode human sentinel on gold last night. Geth hunters and phantoms tend to take 2 throws to kill, but I was playing completely vanilla with only a commando package V for gear. If you brought a power amp III along with you I'm positive nothing would be able to withstand a single one of your throws.

I'm almost reluctant to share this with you all because I don't want Bioware to nerf either the weapon or the class, and banshees...well, run away and unleash your onslaught onto whatever marauders, brutes, or ravagers you come across until you hear them scream and can resume nuking them with explosions.

So anyway, including pics or didnt happen at Pulpit Rock)](http://imgur.com/a/4Svuv) who I actually happen to be visiting in Norway till tomorrow. 

Since my short hiatus from the game

Given Eric seems to be full of irrational decisions and flawed logic (I mean, both of which have no reason to be used over say, a Gethfiltrator with Piranha on the higher difficulties. Not to even mention the rise and fall of the Falcon Assault rifle. Snipers are a shadow of their former selves and a potent sniper on Platinum is a very rare thing to see. 

Smash

I often wonder why Eric decides that nerfing weapons and powers is a better idea than simply buffing the practically unusable weapons. It will always confuse me to why Geth Pulse Rifle/Plasma SMG/Disciple is in the same rarity tier as the Claymore/Geth Plasma Shotgun/Reegar Carbine/Piranha. Instead of nerfing the good weapons (And only a select few at that)

Who actually enjoys playing a game which is managed like this? On paper, but now I have taken a week out, I am not sure I really want to return with the knowledge that two of my favorite classes are not as potent as before. 

Sorry that I have pretty much given you the 2nd new testament to read

Have any of you given up on the multiplayer and why? On the flip side

&gt;
&gt;First, it can also be charged in a second to consume 3 rounds, each doing 3x damage, for a whopping 9x damage per shot - higher damage per shot than the Paladin. This allows one to stagger enemies getting too close, or to one-shot many mooks with a well placed headshot. It also has a higher magazine size and ammo reserve. One gets 6 fully charged shots versus the Paladin's 3. The charged shot also has an amazing chance to apply ammo powers, making a great fit for any tech class.
&gt;
&gt;This gun is also extremely accurate and possesses virtually no recoil when fired rapidly and an amount small enough to easily be re-aimed between charged shots. A fully charged shot with some form of piercing can easily take out a Guardian - and even without it can slay a Trooper, and potentially other enemies depending on gear and passives in a single shot. It can also quickly strip defences from Banshees/Atlases/Praetorians/etc.
&gt;
&gt;Finally
&gt;
&gt;So, accurate, and lightweight. It makes carrying a Pistol and SMG redundant as it fills both roles. It works as a great primary for any caster class and as a decent backup for anyone else. How can anyone have anything but love for such an amazing piece of work?

I have a solid foundation on Soldiers in both a singleplayer and multiplayer aspect. I'm confident in using each Soldier

Each kit will have it's own comment inside this one and will follow this format. Any relevant posts will be hyperlinked in.

**Kit [Name](build link) [Ammo]** - A brief list of how the kit is setup.

**Build Goals**- a short description of how the build operates

**Why Weapon X**- weapon choice is as important as kit choice and thus deserves its own section.

**Minor Alterations**- Sometimes you just need minor alterations to a build to make it better for certain users.

**Ease of Use**- A rough estimate on how much margin of error you have when using it. Easier to use kits will have more room for mistakes than those that kits that are harder to use.

**Platinum Strength**- Most kits do fine on Gold- difficulties, a low health/high DPS kit will be hard to use but have excellent Platinum strength.

**Alternative Builds**- Many kits will have other good builds to choose from and will be discussed here.

1364340296.0,1b2pcu,The Harry Callahan (N7 Destroyer Executioner Pistol),ImNotASWFanboy,50,12,20,"***'I know what you're thinking. ""Did he fire two shots or only one?"" Well to tell you the truth, do ya punk?'***

----------------------------------------------------

To the veterans of this game

As a single shot weapon, how to get around this problem? There is but one man, one incredible warrior who is capable of taking this pistol and pushing it beyond its natural limits to an entirely new level of destruction. It's that fan favourite, the N7 Destroyer. Turn your pocket Widow into a pocket Black Widow!

The long and short of this trick is to abuse two magazine boosting mechanics to turn a one-shot gun into a two-shot gun. Unlike the Mantis, you can equip a Magazine Upgrade on the Executioner. At V this mod gives you 80% extra magazine capacity. Normally this will only give your Executioner a sleek black finish, because 80% isn't enough to turn 1 into 2. But Devastator Mode also grants magazine size increases. The base is 15%, with an additional 5% at rank 2. This gives you the 20% necessary to achieve a 100% mag size increase while active, thus allowing you to have a two-shot Executioner.

What does this mean? With all the damage upgrades available each shot is hitting for over 2, it turns the Executioner into a viable primary weapon instead of a backup. And you look like a fucking badass while doing it.

--------------------------------

[Build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/NDestroyer/RAMNR/Executioner10AI5BK5/Striker10AC5AD5/PistolRailAmp3/StabilizationModule3/CombativesUpgrade5/)

-------------------------------

The build itself is pretty standard for the Destroyer. Unless you're packing a secondary that stands to really benefit from the additional 15% mag size bonus at rank 5, it's my go-to anti-Phantom gun on the Destroyer, it's crude but very effective and adds to the badassness (this is of utmost importance). I would definitely recommend, as always, some anti-Phantom countermeasure as trying to take them out with any single-shot gun is fiddly work. If you're not a fan of the Striker, you can always opt for the GPS, Falcon, if you're confident in your Multifrags

As for equipment, like the Harrier or Typhoon. I find Drill rounds are a good alternative for the less spammy weapons like the Saber. It also gives you 3 metres of penetration (Executioner has 50cm innate) so if you want to slap on the Geth Scanner you can blast shit through walls. It's a lot of fun with the Executioner. Obviously, for rail amps and gear go for pistol damage upgrades, you want to pump out as much damage as possible. I usually roll with Stabilisation Modules in my armour slot because it makes the gun much easier to handle, and again I have a sizable stack of them. Cyclonics are always a good option on the Destroyer though, to buff his tankiness through the roof, or Adrenaline Modules so you can circumvent the movement speed penalty from Devastator Mode.

----------------------------------

So, I urge you to do so. I fully acknowledge that for the Destroyer, it's not the best option. But it's definitely one of the best options for the Executioner, and it is a damn sight more fun than PPR spam. The Executioner is cool. It deserves a second chance.

Hey all
Sorry about the short notice but to answer some of the pings going around - No we're not able to get a challenge event up this weekend.

Nathan.

1357924643.0,16dyx5,ME CoOp College races 102 - turians,Simplywaffle,49,10,29,"Note - read RepShred's base humans 101 before this


Welcome to coop races 102 - the turians.  Strong, and all-around badass, there are five turians in CoOp.  Two are default, the sentinel and soldier, and three are from retaliation - the jet-packing jango fett turians, another soldier, an infiltrator and an engineer.


**Racials and Passives**

The turians are widely regarded as having some of the best passives in the game.  Both the regular and the armiger (jet packs!) have a standard weapon stability

Their fitness is also very good.  The standard soldier and sentinel with full fitness can reach well over 1000 shields with the armigers getting slightly less than the regular turians.

The armigers are considered so godly because they have a huge dodge and a great heavy melee - making them very agile and badass looking.  While the regulars don't have the dodge

**Turian Soldier**

The first one on the list is the basic soldier.  the TS can have up to 37.5% more weapon damage with the passives and has three powers that have good synergy - *Marksman, making him good for tech teams and weapons teams.  However, the TS cannot self-detonate.

* The first power is Marksman, so a tactic people use is just as the clip empties, the TS pops Marksman and more shooting is had.  
* The second power is Proximity mine, which increases damage to a target by 20% for 8 seconds.  Good for bosses, making them more vulnerable for the team.
* the third power is conc. shot

Most builds are weapons builds

**Turian Sentinel**

Widely considered a versatile sentinel and a very good team player in the hands of even an inexperienced player.  The sentinel has the same passives as the soldier, and Overload*.  With these powers, the Tsent can set up tech bursts and BE's, and detonate every kind of burst.  And excellent team player.

* Tech Amor makes the TSent into more of an unstoppable badass of badassery with 30% more power damage with the rank 5 evolution.

* Warp and Overload are the same as in RepShred's post.  

There are several variations on the TSent.  Some people drop warp, there's great variation. Usually if people drop a power, they equip the TSent with a heavier weapon.

DLC classes time!

**Turian Havoc Soldier**

One of the Retaliation classes, the Havoc is an undervalued but effective soldier.

* Havoc Strike is basically like charge, there's no cool down.  Cool.

* Stim packs - the saving grace of the soldier.  Giving a giant shield boost and raise, most players usually use it right after a havoc strike, to imitate a biotic charge.  There is some lag when using it, so be careful.

* Cryo blast - an excellent debuffer that primes a cryo blast and slows enemies down.  While some people look down on the power

Like most turians, the soldier is an underrated but formidable turian.  Not the best, but not the worst.

**Turian Ghost Infiltrator**

Here it is.  The ""Garrus"" class

* tac cloak - similar to the other infiltrators

* stim packs - the same as the havoc's.  Still badass and makes the turian very durable.

* Overload.  See first post linked to top.

There are few builds about the ghost that vary greatly.  Most efficient builds drop fitness altogether

**Turian Saboteur Engineer**

And here is the last turian, and homing grenades*, most people are disappointed with the saboteur.  However, the Saboteur has a lot of potential and power when used with team mates and friends.  Allons-y!

* Sentry turret - throw a turret and let it go to town.  An efficient decoy that can be upgraded with rockets or a flamethrower

* sabotage - make enemies' weapons backfire (wounding them) and take control of robots.  Good against all factions (especially geth and cerberus)

* homing grenade - a grenade that absolutely destroys armor.  Can deal a lot of damage to enemies

Great against geth (hack the pyros and hunters first

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, turians have a reputation of being hardy, efficient, and good team members capable of tanking, shooting and destroying as good as the Destroyer.  Next time - quarians.

1357447960.0,161nrp,Killer Hips - the FQI Melee Build,ChunkyD233,47,8,14,"The figure of the Female Quarian never ceases to amaze. Our subject today must focus on it's capacity for melee wreckage. She doesn't have the brute strength of a Krogan or the Biotic boost of a Vanguard

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Quarian/MMPAK/ATRaider10BG5BH5//StrengthEnhancer3/AdrenalineModule4/BerserkerPackage5/) is the build that I use.

Powers:
Sabotage - 6: Backfire/Explosive/Vulnerability - I list this power first because it is what makes the build unique. The Vulnerability Evolution affects the Omni-Blade heavy melee of the FQI (and other classes with the same type). This adds an additional boost to melee damage that other classes don't have access to. I choose Explosive because Sabotage will mostly be cast from Cloak

Tactical Cloak - 6: Duration/Melee/Bonus Power - Duration is excellent for objectives and allows you to take your time running in to make your move. Bonus Power allows you to use Sabotage to neutralize an enemy from a distance and then move in for the kill while remaining cloaked.

Sticky Grenade - 6: Damage/Armor Pierce/Damage - The beauty of the Melee build is that it makes this grenade easy to place. It should be used carefully

Quarian Defender - 0: The only build I use that doesn't use the passive tree.

Fitness - 6: Melee/Martial Artist/Power Synergy - The obvious melee build choices. I would have liked this class a little better if it had Weapon Synergy

Weapon of Choice: Raider with the Omni-Blade and High Velocity Barrel - The Raider fires fast enough to get both shots off with the Cloak bonus *after* the Melee attack, which gives you better range.

Equipment: Berserker Package; Strength Enhancer; Adrenaline Module really helps with getting in and out of the fray; Ammo - Incendiary. The gun is only used when the enemy survives the melee - the only things that survive have armor

Strategy: Cloak, repeat. The focus target damage capabilities are fantastic. You get a total of 4 temporary melee damage boosts, plus significant passive boosts, as well. Choose your targets carefully and you will rarely take damage. The heavy melee will lock on from a decent range, so take advantage of that. It's actually much easier to hit an enemy that is a few paces from you than one that is right next to you and manages to slip past you mid-animation. It acts as a gap-closer so that you can follow up with your shotgun. However, lean towards caution when deciding whether to keep blasting away or to retreat and live to slash another day.

Tip: If you Sabotage an enemy

Strengths: Single target burst damage; Low Ammo Consumption; CQC master; Survivability

Weaknesses: Hunters are very annoying because it is tricky to hit them with sabotage and your heavy melee won't lock on while they are cloaked; Open spaces; Long range

Give it a try - I'd love to see how you like it or how you'd improve it.",self,t5_2tkk1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/161nrp/killer_hips_the_fqi_melee_build/
1357338017.0,15z2nl,Finished Best of the Best Banner: Thoughts and Tips,sleepyelephant,47,9,33,"I've been working at this banner for a while, I'll try to keep things organized by going in the order of the challenges window

**General**

* Make a plan for each of the challenges. Most do not require each sub-challenge completed
* Try to complete multiple challenges at once. This is obvious, and a map/difficulty that needs some more waves will really help to chip away at these.
* Don't double dip. Finished your 200 waves with a TGI? Great. Move on to your Volus Engineer.
* Most importantly

**Squad Elite**

* This is a pretty straightforward one. Your basic trade-off is higher difficulty extractions vs. number of weekend events completed. If you're on this sub

**Spectre Mastery**

* My advice would be to avoid grinding this one. If you play lots of bronze

**Solo Mastery**

* Harder difficulties count for lower difficulties. This challenge can be completed by doing 2 solo gold
* Work your way up in difficulty.
* Easy solo gold builds include Kroguards, cyclonic modulator IV, and a map that you are really comfortable on. The most important thing is to be patient.
* Don't listen to haters. Kroguard/Glacier/Geth/Gold is still something most people can't do. Be proud of yourself.

**N7 Mastery**

* ALWAYS PROMOTE!
* If you consider how many classes need 200 waves
* Related to the above, and Valkyrie at high levels to get 200 waves for each, while leveling up my sentinel for promotion.
* Recruit packs are a viable grinding method if you must.

**Map Mastery**

* Shoot for 100 gold waves on all but your two least favorite maps.  For me
* Like solo mastery
* If you use the box of shame on platinum Rio

**Biotic/Tech Mastery**

* Do this after you've finished all of your character waves
* I also recommend skipping tech armor damage.

**Resurgence-Retaliation Mastery**

* Opt for the weapon/map extraction sub-challenges. Both can be combined with weapon mastery and map mastery challenges and go pretty quickly.
* Pick your favorite characters (the ones you'll do 200 waves with) for the 10 extraction sub-challenges.
* It is worth noting that the Earth (N7) characters are not eligible for any 200 wave challenges.

**Bloodpack-Outsider Mastery**

* Opt first for the ability and weapon sub-challenges. The ability ones can go very quickly.
* Basically, is to only play the minimum number of waves with the minimum number of characters to get these challenges.
* Get started on Commando Mastery early on. Even if you do all of the ability/weapon subs

**Weapon Mastery**

* Consider two things: What are my favorite weapons? Which weapons do I need for the Alien Mastery challenges?
* The scimitar is painful
* Always carry an SMG or pistol with ultralight materials, switch guns. The low weight won't really impact your cooldown, and you'll be more efficient this way.
* If you have trouble with a specific weapon or weapon type
* If working solely on an SMG challenge

**Cerberus-Collector Mastery**

* There were four types of units that took a while for me: Guardian, Praetorian. It may be different for you, but if you start to notice that one is lagging behind, make an extra effort to hunt them down.
* Praetorians were particularly bad for me, it was a much better way to get those last 50k points. Collectors irritate me, so I did grind the end of this one.
* There are really good links for ""farming"" Guardians and Husks somewhere in this subreddit recently. That said

**TL;DR**: I have lots to say about how I did the challenges, and not feeling like it's a grind.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,Xbox,

I don't think it should be full-on immunity like devastator mode; I'd make them resistant to projectile attacks coming from the front like geth prime blasts/rockets/shotguns/scion cannons

I think it would make choosing between old and new turians a more balanced choice that boils down more to how you want to play. The armigers can be more evasive and dodge attacks

1355935960.0,1545zn,Volus. Viable possibility. Impressive technical potential.,I_pity_the_fool,44,4,27,"I remember how I scoffed when reports showed that the volus might be playable races in mass effect multiplayer. I dismissed these leaks as troll-crafted fabrications. After all

The answer is shitloads. Literally unbelievable amounts of carnage. I'm going to cover the volus engineer in this post, tell you a few things you might not know about them, and discuss what weapons may suit these portly guardians of Irune's honour.

Also, let me have it.

My build is [here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Volus/IPPPD/Scorpion10BA5AJ5/CollectorSMG10BB5AV5/SMGRailAmp3/AdrenalineModule3/ExpertPackage5/). I have soloed gold with it (Geth/Giant

**RECON MINE**

A fairly large debuffing power

You can deploy the mine to walls

* the explosion isn't blocked by cover
* you do not need to be off cooldown to explode the mine. I have a six and a half second cooldown on my RM. I can deploy the mine
* The explosion hits for substantial force. In order to staggar a banshee (necessary if a teammate is about to be insta-killed), but it is often quite easy to predict when someone is about to be grabbed.*
* the slow part of the debuff evolution in rank 6 is deceptively useful. Frequently you can arrange for an entire spawn point to be slowed down while you help the rest of the team with the objectives. Taking 5 of the eight enemies out of circulation is very helpful. This is also quite useful for your teammates' AoE attacks (although on objective waves it would be even better if they just left the buggers alone and sat quietly in the hack circle). The slow evolution comes with a fantastic 25% debuff as well. 
* Debuffs in this game are added together on top of the something peddroelmz calls the headshot mod. So if I hit someone with incinerate for 900 damage, I do (900 * 1.45) 1305 damage. If someone hits that person with a headshot with their grall spike thrower for 2138 damage, they'll do (2138 * (3 + 0.45)) 7376 damage. The headshot mod is the headshot multiplier of the weapon (usually 2.5, but sometimes 3 or 1) if the damage was from a weapon headshot, or one otherwise.
* Recon mine + proxy mine does not exactly nuke spawns
* Recon mine debuffs from different players do not stack: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14108056#14108056

**PROXIMITY MINE**

* Fire a proxy mine and have it stay active on a surface for 30 seconds. Any enemy entering the radius sets off the mine and takes damage. Those whose staggar thresholds are below 300N (or 360N at rank 3) are staggared.
* I take 5 ranks - radius and damage taken. Radius helps me staggar enemies. If I find myself swarmed, melee attacks, and death-cycle clusterfucks (although I still advise using shield boost if you're close, or perhaps even a missile). The 20% extra damage makes proxy probably a better debuff than cryo blast (which has a max duration of 6s, I believe, and doesn't set off tech combos).
* Proxy mine will probably be what you're spamming both in good groups and if you're soloing. Good players tend not to need shield boost too much (although if you notice a competent player dying a lot
* Proxy mine also sets off tech explosions (and you can exploit this yourself if you're on your own and have disruptor/incendiary ammo). These do a fair amount of damage - a tech burst with rank 5 proxy and some disruptor ammo does 675 damage to enemy health and twice that to shields on gold
* Proxy mine bonuses from the *same* player do not stack. Proxy mine damage bonuses from different players *do* stack: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14108056#14108056

**SHIELD BOOST**

* Despite the volus engineer mainly being a debuffer, ""lost shields!"", ""I'm hit!"", ""PAAAIN!""
* shield boost and the volus heavy melee will together give you two seconds of damage immunity and around 90% DR. I've survived a meltdown in the hazard reactor using this - give it a try! Spoiler: the room goes a lovely pure white
* shield boost, or squadmates going through ravager puddles.
* Characters have a shorter shield recharge time if their shields have not been completely destroyed. Because shield boost restores a small amount of shields for 3 seconds after cast
* The description for evolution 6 of shield boost says that damage reduction is capped at 90%. According to tyhw on the BSN
* Evolution 5 is incomprehensibly bad. What would you rather have? 170 shields per second for 6 seconds or 170 shields per second for 3 seconds AND take 37.5% less damage from all sources? Easy choice
* There's a bug with shield boost. Having a volus near you activate it while you're reloading causes you to be locked out of powers and firing your gun. Volus affected by this bug are locked out of heavy melee as well. The cure is to heavy melee. Falling off a ledge also works.
* Finally damage reduction of 50% does not reduce all incoming damage by one half. The damage reduction percentage is itself reduced by a quarter. See here - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11481777
* The amount of shields delivered in a lump on activation is a little strange - unlike the extra shields over 3 seconds, and see if this is merely a glitch with the character screen, or whether it actually has some effect in game.

**MELEE**

* Information about the melee comes from corlist: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15123388#15123388. I've also looked through the settings in the coalesced file (Also [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/143jkv/volus_meleeshield_boost_mechanics/) is the reddit discussion about that article)
* regular/light melee gives you a 4 second cloak that isn't broken by reviving, in the blind hope that they'll catch you. You might also intercept bullets fired at your teammates. Rockets and warps fired at you before you cloaked continue to follow you (you should use heavy melee to tank those). And finally, geth rocket drones completely ignore all cloaks. This cloak is on a 6 second cooldown counted from the moment you trigger it. Unlike other cloaks, firing your gun, reviving and using powers won't break it. Also your shields will recharge while cloaked. 
* This ""ghetto cloak"" gives you one of your best tools for survival and for revives. Frequent and efficient use of it is basically the key to surviving as a volus on gold. As Alec Baldwin's character in Glengarry Glen Ross might have said
* Your heavy melee gives you 1 second immunity to all damage and regenerates 10% of your shields. It also gives you around 55% DR. Remember that regaining some of your shields means that you have a 3 second wait until your shields start regenerating rather than a 4 second wait
* The heavy melee puts out 600N of force. This is enough to staggar a dragoon (250N threshhold)
* Use heavy melee if you've been hit by a DoT effect and you don't want to use shield boost.
* volus cannot be grabbed by husks and abominations. And they can also use heavy melee to damage and repel them

**KIT LIMITATIONS AND ADVANTAGES**

* Volus are often in cover even while standing up. You can hide behind cover
* ""Right-hand advantage"" is standing so that your crosshairs are on the enemy but your body is in cover. Exploiting this is the second key to volus survivability. It's quite frequent that I can fire at, but it's really the way volus are meant to be played.

1351579010.0,12bsal,Platinum: Go Full Tech,ELNOOBSTER,39,2,13,"Hi Folks

Recently I've been playing Platinum difficulty with the usual team. Of the last 13 platinum matches I had 13 extractions

* 3 Engineers + 1 Infiltrator is a really good combination
* 1 Volus Engineer is *really* helpful
* Quarian Female Infiltrator helps a lot with the Sabotage Tech vulnerability
* Incendiary rounds are a good choice because they prime fire explosions
* Collectors wont show up if you don't choose them specifically. They have resistance to combos.

For engineers, Salarians, Humans all work well. Turian Sentinel is also a boss due to having both Overload (best exploder) and Warp (one of the best debuffs / exploders). Demolisher is very useful on some maps, like Condor, where the ammo boxes are very stingy. 

The idea is to have debuffs (Volus mines, even Warp if someone runs a Turian sentinel, Sabotage) and tech / fire combos spam going *and* also bring the most powerful guns you have: Talons, Harriers, Hurricanes, Acolytes (for shield strip).

The firepower is so ridiculous that a Platinum Atlas can be taken down in about one second after the shields are gone. 

Objectives rely on Infiltrator (activate 4) or group movement with volus shield recharge and

1350482311.0,11moae,Well here I come I'm poppin' Barriers on your ass bitch! - Krogan Shaman Adept build,ImNotASWFanboy,39,5,39,"*Preface: So this is a technique I've been using on my singleplayer Vanguards for quite a while now. It's obviously better in SP since Liara's Warp has instant transmission and doesn't run off your own cooldowns. With that said

*Note: Unless stated otherwise

One of the best things about the Adept class is its ability to not only dish out fucktons of damage with the biotic good stuff, for the Drell it's Cluster Grenades and Pull, for the humans it's Singularity. Being able to render enemies completely helpless, harmless and vulnerable to an easy BE finisher has always made the Adept shine when compared to other biotics on the field. So initially I was a little disappointed with the Krogan Shaman's moveset because while he has the uber-powerful Warp-Shockwave combo, he lacks any obvious CC move. But then I remembered that Barrier has a detonation, which I know from playing SP is amazing for CC. Allow me to elaborate:

* Barrier has an extremely short cooldown - at 200% recharge, you can spam it. Double tap Barrier (ie. activate, detonate) for an almost instant detonation. Only the detonation of Barrier initiates a cooldown, which is why double tapping is so useful.

* The detonation specced out right has a radius of 5.4m and literally sends unshielded mooks *flying*. Pop a barrier in a tight situation to instantly propel your attackers to the other side of the map. And unlike in singleplayer

* Suspending an enemy primes them for a biotic explosion. Self explanatory. Coupled with the detonate evolutions for Warp and Shockwave

* If it doesn't suspend an enemy, a Krogan Headbutt to the face will stun him out of it. Due to the AoE nature of the blast, you can stagger whole groups, which can keep them pinned down while you send your Warp or Shockwave out to catch the unlucky soul who got suspended. And since it's on a short cooldown, double tapping Barrier is as fast and more efficient than the Falcon. If something still has shields, you can detonate and stagger their protection away no problem. Acolyte's better for stripping that shit though.

So with this in mind

Since you're using Barrier as a primarily offensive tool

If you're on PC, as once they start to fall down, you've missed your chance. Unlike Barrier, which gives you more than enough time to hit them.

Warp evolutions are self explanatory and if you do it any other way

What I like most about this build is it combines both an offensive and defensive strategy, which makes it a hell of a lot of fun to play. You get to play him like a krogan, so you don't forsake your Tuchankan heritage, but you can also dish out powerful combos from a safe distance. So the basic strategy is: against mooks, strip any shields with the Acolyte, charge in, pop barrier and Warp or Shockwave suspended targets for easy BEs. Works great on Phantoms, sit in cover, double tap Barrier or headbutt to stagger and buy yourself a bit of time to get those primers and detonators off. Warp-headbutt-Shockwave is the GGNoRe 3-hit combo for Dragoons.

1349848943.0,118nfg,Item Drop Rates for PSPs - Preliminary Data,InterwebNinja,40,0,23,"First of all

I've organized this the information in a pie chart [here](http://imgur.com/kH9wW).  Rather than think of this in terms of percentages, for this chart, I scaled it to expected number of items per 100 PSPs.  This distribution assumes you have none of the item categories maxed.  Obviously, once that happens, the probabilities change (but in a fairly predictable way).

Now, so I had to calculate likelihoods for each item type individually.  Also, in some cases, people maxed out a category, which mucks up the percentages.  In any case, the results pass a basic sanity check.  Out of 100 PSPs, we expect to get 500 total items.  The items listed here add up to 502

But

* *Ultra-Rares appear to have an increased likelihood.*  In this set of data, as it accounts for about 35% of the URs unlocked here.  Even if you take the Volus out, 17.5% of the PSPs had an UR.  That's quite high, but we should note that the sample size means that the margin of error is pretty high on this.  Specifically, we can be 95% confident that the expected number of UR weapons in a PSP is between 0.12 to 0.23.  Even if it's as low as 0.12, I'm pretty sure that's better than it was in the past.  More data would help narrow down this range (I'm looking at you, RepublicanShredder

* *You can now expect a Rare Gear and Weapon Mod in about 2/5 PSPs.*  For gear, but that's a very high number.  I think they may have rebalanced the Gear likelihoods after they became nearly impossible to get.  For the Weapon Mods, take it with a grain of salt, as it seems those weren't released until the balance changes came out, so people who bought PSPs really early after the DLC didn't get them.  My sample on those was only 37 PSPs.

* *Rare weapons unlock at a higher rate than Rare characters.*  This may have been the case before


The Volus add a fair amount of uncertainty into the UR discussion.  It will be interesting to see what happens once people max them out.  I really doubt URs are going to unlock at a 30% rate once you do.  Purely speculation, using, say at 15% probability.  Then, if that fails, check for an UR character, say at 12% probability (this would match the pattern of Rare characters being less likely than Rare weapons).  Then, if that fails, if something like this is the case

Since many people here will soon be maxing their Rare characters and weapons

~~Finally, who knows how long it will take).~~  Ignore this paragraph, the issue has apparently been fixed.

Anyway, I'd like to eventually get some data on SPs, as I wasn't able to get a large enough sample to draw any meaningful conclusions here.

1332969236.0,ri5ix,PRO TIP: How to Reload Cancel (Reload Faster),TiLun,40,3,19,"I know a lot of people must know this

I have tested this technique in multiplayer with the only heavy weapons I have (M-99 Saber and Widow). However this technique seems to work on all of the weapons that I have in singleplayer.

**Definition:** A *reload cancel* is a technique used by many shooters that involves interrupting the reload animation in order to shoot faster.

**How To Do It:** As you reload your weapon (popping/ejecting the thermal clip) watch for the number of bullets currently in your HUD change then tap **SPACE**. Your character will then go from a reload state to the regular state (ready to fire).

This technique is used by almost all shooters that can cut down half the time of reload. Reload cancelling works for most weapons with long reloads such as:

* Heavy assault rifles (Renevant, etc.)
* Heavy shotguns (Claymore
* Bolt Action Snipers (Mantis

The reload on heavy assault rifles requires the character to insert a thermal clip under the rifle then hit the bolt-stop on the side. The bullet count changes once the thermal clip is inserted into the rifle

Heavy shotguns work very similarly to heavy assault rifles; your character will insert a thermal clip into the shotgun then pump it. A reload cancel stops the pump action and lets you shoot faster. This can greatly increase the fire rate of these shotguns.

Sniper rifles greatly benefit from reload cancelling. The pull-bolt snipers require your character to insert a thermal clip and pull on the bolt to chamber the round. However a reload cancel will let you shoot as soon as you insert a thermal clip into the sniper. This can almost double the rate of fire of the Widow.

How you use these techniques is up to you. 

**NOTE:**  
In pc ~~gaming master race~~ space is the default input for action/sprint/cover/everything. So just use the correct button for the consoles.

You can't be moving or behind cover while you reload cancel; this will result in you leaving cover,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,Alliance,t3_ri5ix

The vanguard can be a mobile tank b/c of the ability to replenish barrier instantly.

well, that there are super-stealthy infiltrators, not all classes are squishy, and most dramatically, the cobra missile (what does this thing do? WOW!!!). i discovered some new guns, learnt to run around a lot (being revived all the time is a little embarrassing!), punched a few people so hard they died. i still can't really aim

i learnt to hate banshees. i learnt to hate phantoms even more. now i hate with the most passion those annoying little bombers. but i loved playing against dragoons

i am notoriously chatty on the mic, Nar-Laien, Nate159WG, among many others) who thought i was worth helping along. good friends now, they all are. they carried me through many, many games. my first taste of platinum left me wide-eyed and in shock - my N7 17 character spent most of the game dying, being revived, taking a step

i spent a LOT of time watching mind-blowingly brilliant players from spectator mode

i fell in love with the krysae (sadly i never saw it pre-nerf), ""they're dead!"". i loved it when people would actually chat to each other instead of mindlessly zoning in to their own private little universe. the discovery of this reddit opened up a whole new world of joy to me.

my notorious south african lag could not dampen my fun. i got used to being banshee-grabbed from the other side of the map

**Levelling System and XP Cards**

*XP Rewards*

Here's a relevant BSN thread regarding how XP is gained (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15679903). It discusses how 
points are allocated based on how it is killed and who killed it. The most important thing I want to emphasize to grasp from this 
post is the point modifiers based on difficulty.

1.0x for Bronze

1.2x for Silver

1.6x for Gold

2.0x for Platinum

Given these modifiers
amount of time. However
in a pinch. If you don't think you're skilled enough

*Levels 1 to 20*

Here's an informative post on BSN regarding how much XP it takes to reach the next level (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/12430376#12432326). Note how the halfway point for XP is at level 17. Here are some interesting observations that I have made when leveling up regarding point distribution and suggestions to distribution.

* L. 1 (2 points; one pt. to cooldown skill

* L. 4 (11 points;  4 ranks + one point)

* L. 8 (24 points;  can max out one skill with 3 pt. to spare)
 
* L.13 (45 points; can max out two skills with 3 pt. to spare)

* L.17 (63 points; can max out three skills

*XP per game (rough estimates based on empirical evidence)*

Bronze (~100k XP)

Silver (200k to 300K XP)

Gold (300k XP to 500k XP

Platinum (400k to 600k XP

Assuming each Gold game takes 30 minutes (factors initial loading, etc.) and 
an avg. XP/game of 380k
roughly 3.5 hr to promote a class. At 60 promotions
with challenges under the Aliens tab (200 waves as Y kit) to prevent boredom. You can churn out roughly 420 waves if you 
constantly play new kits during your time with N7 Mastery.

*XP Cards*

XP cards can save some time. Basic cards (in Recruit and Veteran Packs) roughly split half and half between 62500 XP and 12500 XP 
(Recruit only) cards. Do note that once all the Common weapons and mods are maxed out Recruit packs guarantee a character card with each purchase. Packs with Rare items (SPs, APs) give out 250k XP cards. They don't guarantee one and unless you are missing cards, I advise against it as those characters take the Uncommon slot and are not guaranteed to drop when all the character cards are maxed (not 
even in Reserves Packs). 

Assuming a 50/50 split between 62500 XP and 12500 XP cards in Recruit Packs
saves approximately 3 minutes of game time assuming 380k XP/30 minute game. A 250k XP card saves approximately 20 minutes of game 
time assuming the 380k XP/30 minute game assumption is true. Given that Recruit Packs give 7.5 XP/Credit and Reserve Packs give 
2.52525 XP/Credit (assuming one character card in said pack)
for XP. However, so I advise buying packs when you don't have enough time for a full game, typically in the time span of 5 to 10 minutes.

Look in the comments for Part 2 regarding leveling strategies.

**ENEMY TYPES**

* **Troopers**: *Assault Troopers, Collector Trooper*. These are the baseline enemies, and usually the easiest to kill, as they lack any kind of shielding. They are only really dangerous in large numbers, or when backed up by other types of enemies. They also serve as grenadiers, with all but the Geth Trooper being able to throw grenades to flush you out of cover. Grenades can one-shot most classes if you're right on top of them, so pay attention when fighting these types of enemies and listen for the beep-beep-beep sound they make.

* **Captains**: *Centurions, Collector Captains*. These are units that are capable of supporting their faction with various abilities. Centurions can obscure your vision with clouds of smoke, letting their units shoot from relative safety. Marauders can buff Cannibals and Husks around them by putting armored plates on them that can block shots. Collector Captains can spawn power-blocking Seeker Swarms, while the possessed variety can spawn even more dangerous Seeker Plagues. Hunters are strange in that they don't buff their faction, but rather rely on their other troops to distract players while they sneak up cloaked right next to them and unload. Captain level units are also very adept at melee combat, with Marauders and Hunters being very dangerous up-close.

* **Suppressors**: *Nemeses, Ravagers, Scions*. These are units that are designed to keep you pinned down in cover while close-range units close in and rip you to shreds. They are all long-range units, and are therefore best taken out by snipers or power classes. Alternatively, Vanguards are able to close in very fast, negating their long-range advantage quickly. Cerberus is notable for having two different kinds of Suppressors: Nemeses fill the long-range role, with very damaging sniper rifles that thankfully come with a very noticeable second-long charge-up. If you hear the telltale whine, or get ready to lose your shields or health gate. Turrets, Engineers are often priority targets for snipers. When engaging a turret, which fire in very damaging three-round long-range volleys. They can hit you easily from the other side of the map

* **Cover Busters**: *Guardians, Geth Pyros, Geth Bombers, Brutes, Husks, Abominations, Possessed Scions*. Cover Busters are enemies that generally have very good close-range damage, like Dragoons, are able to close in very fast and knock you out of cover, Pyros

* **Big Bosses**: *Atlas, Praetorian*. These are the biggest and baddest enemies on a faction, with widely varying powers. They all have an insane amount of health, and all have both some kind of shielding and armoring. Atlases and Primes are both psuedo-Suppressors, with great long-range capabilities and staggers. Atlases can pop smoke like Centurions, and have the ability to fire homing rockets like Geth Rocket Troopers. Primes are not unlike Ravagers, firing long range, and spawning combat drones that also stagger, and become temporarily immune to tech or biotic explosions. Praetorians combine the worst of both worlds

* **Sync Killers**: *Phantoms, Brutes, Scions*. These enemies are notable for being able to perform short-range instant kills known as sync-kills, that will automatically kill their victim-- in other words, you can't revive them until the wave is over. The first three units sync kill much more often that the last three, but all should be treated with care, and ideally at long range.

1356034682.0,156nuv,Weapons Tier List: SMGs,Kallously,41,7,86,"To promote and foster some discussion as well as maybe push an idea I PMd RepShred (I'm still waiting for that to get off the ground &gt;.&gt;)

The idea here is to rate each weapon and how they stack up to each other and against other weapons in the game. I'll start off with SMGs since there aren't too many of them and I've used them all quite a bit.

I feel like I have a decent knowlege of the game and ok mechanical skill (I can solo gold up to 6-7ish fairly consistently) so I figured I could get the ball rolling for each set of dicussions with my personal evaluations of each gun.

However, justifications and process. At its core, I want this list to be developed by the community.

In regards to the weapon tiers themselves

**Damage:** How much hurt does this gun put out under perfect circumstances?

**Usability:** Directly related to damage, and overkill.

**Flexibility/Utility:** What classes can make good use of this gun? What sort of mods can be reasonably used on the gun to suit different situations or player playstyles? Does it have an unique effect that adds to the potency of the weapon?

Weapons will be judged as if they were at level X

The tiers themselves will go from bronze to platinum. However, the order of guns within a tier itself also reflect how good that gun is ie. the first gun in the platinum list is better than the 3 one might be, but all of them are better than guns in the gold tier and below.

Justifications for each gun will be provided in the comments along with some general usage tips. If you want to comment on a weapon's tier or discuss it in general

Main weapon comments and the top post will be updated as feedback and discussion opens up.

Now onto the list!

1347602903.0,zv5o1,Multiplayer Class Idea: The N7 Adamant,Argus1001,52,19,26,"[EDIT] Reddit won't let me change the title

Hey guys
I think BioWare's done a pretty good job of expanding our options for taking the fight to Multiplayer, the Sentinel was *the* definitive jack-of-all-trades class, with some nice support abilities. The jack-of-all-trades element is still there in Mass Effect 3, but none of the Sentinels really feel like support characters to me. So I sat down and thought of ways to both bring a new support character to the game while providing a unique gameplay experience we haven't seen yet.

After a couple of hours of brainstorming

Here's the overall concept for the Adamant:  The class uses both Biotic and Tech abilities, Twin Disciplines. This is a toggled skill that switches the Adamant between Biotic and Tech modes. Each of these modes also comes with offensive and defensive bonuses, respectively, as outlined below. There are also two skills which have dual functionalities depending on which mode the Adamant is in: Salvo, which acts like a damage / force missile in Biotic mode and a shield restoring projectile in Tech mode, and Force Field, which causes damage over time and sets enemies up for biotic explosions in Biotic mode

In a nutshell

For full details, but if you guys think it's a really good idea, maybe we can push it to BioWare and see it in a future DLC pack! 

Note that all values and percentages below are estimates; I didn't do much calculation on them, it's going to be. :P

Adamant

&lt;Race&gt; Sentinel

&lt;Insert racial description here&gt;

Adept annihilation wave is close combat ability, able to spec to increase movement speed.  Dark channel is good, like single player.  Think you have to recast for multiple explosions.

Engineers have the fire heavy melee that should work on targets already on fire or frozen to cause extra damage

Geth pulse and The new pheonix characters have electric heavy melees which look like they should cause tech bursts if someone around them has been hit with overload.

Do people agree. Would it mean that Krogan, and other non-applicable heavy melee would be essentially less powerful in comparison? Is it a balancing issue?

Or do you think that these wouldn't always happen and therefore would just be an added bonus to finding the right time to heavy melee.

Well friend

Here is InterwebNinjas [Pushing into Gold post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/).

And here is mrcle123s [How to solo](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17chzb/me_coop_college_503_how_to_solo/) post. 

And my post noting some little tips when [Soloing on console](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17i2jw/how_to_solo_on_console/).

So now you have your reading

Now you are done with your reading

[Mrcle123](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCit0rk2PNe_6TR-dXq-FGcQ) and [AaronEh](https://www.youtube.com/user/georgeaaustin/videos) both have videos that are excellent resources to refer to. I actually have based a lot of my own solo gameplay on Mrcle123s style of play and adapted it to my own. I have watched more videos of his than I would like to admit.

So now you can spend hours and hours practicing. Yes

Learning from your mistakes will be invaluable at learning your own style of success. Watch your own gameplay back if you are able to just to see what went wrong. 

So you can now solo. Now try it with the shittiest weapons in the game. Looking at you Viper/Shuriken/Incisor/GPR. You are literally going to need the patience of a Mongolian monk ninja. Or something. Because this solo will take you twice as long as it normally would. Ive completed solos with the Falcon (Which I actually think is amazing, Tempest and Mantis. None of those weapons are close to being top tier. But you can make them reasonably good via a winfiltrator, soldier or engineer (In the case of high capacity tickle guns.)

Now we have covered patience

Did I mention patience? Yeah you will need that. 

**Don't be afraid to just quit**. 

You will fail

I have now failed 3/3 of my GPR solo attempts. [The most recent, but there is a TLDR on the video for those who want to just skip ahead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raDlpqU7-oc&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUYfe_F1Q1MEcbUCn8pC_mFQ). I do however recommend watching through the game. I have cut it down to the last 2 waves so you don't have to be bored for the first 7. It was very systematic and generally boring to watch IMO. The last 2 waves I included because I think it perfectly displays that one mistake can cost you the match, which also displaying some key choices that I made, which kept me alive (I.e predicting oncoming brutes and warp balls as to dodge them most effectively, using soft cover to maximum advantage and just plain simple running away like a bitch.)

As always

Thanks for your time

Weapons
-

There is only one. Reegar. 

If you really don't want to use the reegar, use the reegar). 

They typical *ammo* choice is incendiary of course

For *armor equipment*, so I go with adrenaline mods instead. This allows you move back out of melee range after charging much more easily. 

Another option is shield power cells

For *gear* I usually go with stronghold pack on this class for the delicious shield recharge. But even outside of solos I'm still a fan of armored compartments on this class. The extra ammo is nice to have

Gameplay
---

**Videos**

I've got a [gold (18:24)](http://youtu.be/pq5HWXtjlnE) and a [platinum (40:42)](http://youtu.be/uqDTqj08TMI) video. 

Both of them are also my entries in the gold and platinum solo challenges of the mecoop tournament. So if anyone wanted to see the build for that

These videos show very well just how ridiculous the krogan vanguard is. The gold video shows his incredible tankiness. I'm not even using a cyclonic modulator and I still only die once

The platinum video shows the general power of this class. The incredible efficiency at taking out phantoms and dragoons is what makes a quick cerberus solo possible. 

Just for comparison sake

---

Tips
-

**About melee**

Using melee for damage is pointless in my opinion. If you had just kept shooting your reegar instead you would have done 3x more damage. 

The melee does have some uses though. 

My gameplay in the solos isn't quite indicative of this

If you heavy melee right after charging, you should actually be invincible). This can be useful when you accidentally charge into something you shouldn't have. 

**About rage**

If you can get rage up it's always nice (unless you are on hazard white)

On waves that have husks

You'll probably spend so much time trying to keep your rage going that you would have been better of if you had just blasted the enemies with the reegar. 

**About charge**

In my opinion there are four reasons to charge: 

* To refill shields when there is no quick way to get into cover
* To move around the map and close gaps to enemies quicker
* To stagger enemies (primarily phantoms)
* To get the 25% weapon damage bonus against bosses

If none of these reasons apply, it's a waste of time.

What also ties into this approach is my love for shield regeneration on this class. It allows me to use charge less

**Conclusion**

I hadn't played this kit for quite a while when I broke him out for the solo challenges in the tournament. I had honestly forgotten just how powerful this class is. 

For gold games I use a much more melee heavy build

On platinum

So this build will probably go into retirement again for me

If you want to break into platinum for the first time

**Racial Passives and Traits**

Krogan get two great racial passives. Krogan Berserker is alright for power damage and weapon damage

Krogan also get a great Fitness passive called Rage. When Rage is taken, allowing it to stagger bosses with sufficient upgrades. Although this is powerful, it is mitigated a little by the Krogan's inability to dodge.

**Krogan Shaman Adept**

A tanky Adept, and Shockwave*, the Shaman is an excellent Adept that acts as a solid tank that every Biotic team could use.

* Barrier acts like Tech Armor. Activating it gives damage reduction, but it can lift an enemy down to Health only in addition to dealing damage.

* Warp is a solid power and should never be neglected. Decent damage, and debuffing ability all help Warp's case as an excellent power. Warp can easily be snuck in after a heavy melee on a troublesome enemy, like a Phantom.

* Shockwave is also a power Biotic attack that can go through walls with a high BE modifier of 65% to hit multiple enemies. Although it has a limited range and wobbles the screen during use

With both solid powers and tanking ability

**Krogan Soldier**

Like all Krogan, where he is a warrior loaded for bear with Fire Explosions.

* Fortification is an active power that grants damage reduction when active and a stat boost at Rank 5. When purged

* Carnage is a nice power. It basically acts likes Incinerate

* Inferno Grenades are thrown at a low arc

So the Krogan Soldier can be either a melee tank or a Fire Exploding warrior. This is not for the faint of heart and great care should be taken when using the Krogan Soldier in a squad.

**Krogan Sentinel**

Sentinels are known for tanking, and clear loads of minions in a jiffy (*Lift Grenades*).

* Tech Armor will increase damage resistance with a stat boost at Rank 5

* Incinerate has its uses in terms of strong Armor damage, turning it from an alright to great power on the Krogan Sentinel.

* Lift Grenades are extraordinarily powerful and have a great radius as well. They can even lift an enemy with Health into the air after detonating. Unfortunately

This kit is one of the tank of tanks. In between high health, the Krogan Sentinel can go to any place with any enemy and be useful.

**Krogan Vanguard**

Vanguards are excellent at tanking enemy fire and the Krogan Vanguard is THE king of tanking. With *Biotic Charge and
Barrier*

* Biotic Charge for the Krogan hits harder than most Vanguards' Charges. Combine with the fact it can regen 100% of the Krogan Vanguard's Barriers (Rank 6)

* As seen with the Krogan Shaman

* Carnage does not see that much use on the Kroguard

Kroguards are great for lone wolf players

**Conclusion**

The Krogan really follow the rule of work hard and party hard. They are literally tanks of feet and should never be dismissed as weak in a lobby. While they do require some skill to use, Krogan are nearly unstoppable on the field of battle. It's no wonder they fought off the Rachni and almost conquered the entire galaxy right afterwords.

1356921008.0,15pb5q,welloktheniguess' Let's go big or lets go home Platinum Guide!,,44,8,49,"[WORK IN PROGRESS] I'm not sure which waves spawn which enemies (it's something I adapt to ingame; choosing Geth as the enemy is very much harder than choosing Cerberus or Reaper and I can't quite remember which causes which factions to spawn on which wave)

Platinum really isn't hard. This is why.

**Intro**

Once you can handle Gold, once you can't handle your spot call a friend over. If you consistently fail to hold your choke, you should probably go back to Gold/Silver or tune your class/build.

Once you learn about the way classes synergise and which weapons/skills are good Platinum becomes easy. All those things you've learnt about right hand advantage and class synergy are what will drive you into Platinum. The niggles of this game such as the spawns

**Tips**

**Objective Waves:**

Courier Mission - This is usually relatively easy. A fast (Drell, go as a team and steamroll your way through. You can 'pulse' dodge to alternately drop the package and dodge forward to increase carry speed but this really is not necessary and takes a bit of practice. 

Four Hack objective - This can be one of the hardest. There are some spots where it's just difficult. Key things here are to send a class suited to deal with it if it's out of the way, hit cloak and Shield Boost then start the hack. This gives you extra immunity. If you're a Ghost, hit a Stim and Cloak before doing it; you have extra HP for some seconds and the cloak.

Escort - This is pretty simple and relatively easy. You can't do much other than stack on and work your way through. It's usually over quickly and since you're moving you won't get overrun like on a hack objective.

Hack objective - This can be the worst. Some maps just have awful hack objective placements (Rio, Hunters, Dragoons etc are closing in) then missile them. You might need to use two per objective if you're in a bad spot.

Target Elimination - DING DING DING

**Enemies to deal with:**

 If there is an agile sync killer; deal with it. Phantoms or Banshees in your camping spot means everyone should kill the and quick. With a full team on it they shouldn't be alive very long. They can't sync kill you on stairs/slopes! Got two Banshees in your hair? Stick the tanked up Krogan/Destroyer/Volus/Ghost etc on the stairs to dance with them and tell your team to burn them down quick.

Primes are the bane of your life. They have insane damage, if you take a blast MOVE). Once they spawn turrets behind you and a Combat Drone flanks you they are seriously unpredictable. Unless you're completely out of sight, deal with it FAST.

Stuff like Hunters can be dealt with quick but if allowed to can ruin your day if you allow them to flank you. Same with Pyros

Atlases are slow moving and their damage is easily mitigated. Abusing right hand advantage means you should never get hit by a missile. Allowing yourself to get hit by a missile when surrounded by teammates affects you all since it's an AoE stagger and DoT.

**Team synergy and general tips**: 

Biotic teams are brilliant. There is no question. I'm sure most of you have played a biotic with a half decent other biotic and you've noticed how much easier things are. This said, and given a detonator it does even more. Soldiers stand alone as absolute powerhouses, although the ones with a detonator or Flamer (or similar) pay dividends.

Team synergy along with decent gear is most of the battle.

The next most important thing is strategy. I'm going to go through each map and provide a very simple strategy. If you fail

The utmost of importance is awareness and communication. See a Phantom closing in? Warn everyone. Call out targets. Want to burn down a problematic Atlas or Prime? Tell people. With the right firepower most bosses last less than ten seconds. Once that's over you get back to your job. If your posted choke is dead or empty, with practice, become easy to kite or kill yourself.

**Map Strategies** - 

These aren't the be all and end all. There are great points in the comments which you should definitely read too. With a solid team camping isn't necessary but it's always nice to have somewhere to fall back to.

**Firebase Dagger:** 

You can sit in the circular observatory building. You have three chokes. The one that leads towards extraction, so unless you're going out to clean up, stay close to the team and out of the open.

**Firebase Ghost:** 

I'll admit this is the map I find the hardest. With good teams it's a breeze, although it is still pretty open. The ammo boxes on this map are generous enough with a couple of grenades. A tank character can draw problematic enemies like Banshees by sitting on the stairs (things can't sync kill you on stairs). The boxes are fair here, two grenades each.

**Firebase Giant:** 

Firebase Giant/Cerberus is possibly the easiest Platinum matchup. Once you spawn, relative from where you spawn. The meat of your firepower should be directed towards this, but the area towards the ladder can sometimes be the spawn and allow things like Phantoms up. An easy tactic here is Flamer and behind wall detonator (Phoenix/Electric Slash/Shockwave). This wrecks and will make things simpler for those watching out for the flanks. With a good setup (Techsplosions, Justicar bubble with a detonator) you can wreck the meat of the spawn and what comes from the side is easily dealt with. This isn't a great grenadier map (it's perfectly doable but the boxes are 1 grenade a piece). The mid map hack objective can be insane on this map; use missiles liberally.

**Firebase Glacier:** 

This is the map where you can get the fastest Plat runs (I think my record is sub-19 minutes). The place to camp is the room that's the lowest point; to your right from the extraction. The long staircase allows you an easy way to avoid sync kills from Banshees although the meat of your fighting should be holding that room and treating it as two chokes; from the extraction and from the elevated room. There is an ammo box on the stairs; IIRC it's two grenades. Some of the Hack4 objectives can be hard on this map; if you get one be liberal with missiles.

**Firebase Reactor:** 

Once you spawn
**
Firebase White:** 

Holding the high ground directly adjacent to the spawn or holding the back of the map are both good ideas here. The high ground and the far parts of the map (behind where you used to FBW/G/G camp) both provide an ammo box and easy cover abuse (right hand advantage) and a pair of chokes. The objectives here usually prove fairly simple.

**Firebase Condor:** 

Unless you're playing with friends or a team you've just blasted through multiple Plats in 20 mins with don't bother

**Firebase Hydra:** 

There is the 'control room' adjacent to the extraction on this map. Camp there. There are two chokes

**Firebase Goddess:** 

Once you spawn hang a right and right again to get into the room with all the computers in it. You have an ammo box in this room

**Firebase Jade:** 

This is one I lack experience on and don't like that much. The long corridor left of your extraction as you spawn is probably the best place to hold. There is an ammo box and two chokes, so Ghosts/grenadiers rejoice. There are two chokes but each of them are corners the enemy come around with you down a corridor. This gives them advantage.

**Firebase London:** 

The side of the map adjacent from your extraction is where to camp. Ignore the high ground

**Firebase Rio:**

 Welcome to grenade heaven. Hold the side of the map with the shipping containers. If you camp in the shipping containers you're pretty safe but Satan will come and rape you for queueing for Plat and then doing that. This is actual truth, but played right there are two chokes proper you should watch. Getting hack objective in the middle of wave 10 is slaughter and you should happily use every consumable you have to get through that horror; be FUCKING liberal.

**Firebase Vancouver:** 

I haven't really realised great camping spots for this map. I don't find it hard on Plat with a good team

Notes: Collector Plat is just harder than each other matchup. It's fine with a solid team

I hope this helps! If you need me to clarify anything I've said,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1356962489.0,,,t3_15pb5q

1350289815.0,11i5ii,Why You Should Care For: The N7 Eagle,RepublicanShredder,49,17,65,"*Alternate Title: How I l Learned to Stop Whining and Love the Eagle.*

Like the Geth Pulse Rifle, but the Eagle was literally a piece of rubbish in comparison. Even by itself, the initial Eagle wasn't that great.

When I first tried it

____________________________________________________

*Why is the N7 Eagle reviled?*

**I never asked for this**- Despite being a heavy pistol, and somewhat low damage per shot (compared to other pistols) made it an odd one in the bunch of pistols. Few saw the need for such a pistol, especially when an SMG or Phalanx was present to satisfy their needs of a rapid fire weapon. 

**This gun flies right out of my hand**- The recoil on this gun

**I demanded a specialist

**I DEMAND SATISFACTION**- Compared to the Crusader, the Eagle was essentially the equivalent of getting coal for Christmas. Not only was the Eagle so-so, it meant that you could have gotten a better weapon. This made a lot of people angry.

There were some legitimate reasons why the Eagle deserves hate

____________________________________________________
*And why should I give the N7 Eagle a second shot?*

**This is a gun? I can't feel it.**- A nice attribute this gun possesses is that it hardly weighs anything

**Jack of all trades, the Eagle can be modified to suit anyone's needs, be it a melee and AP weapon for Slayer, a damage and capacity heavy SMG for snipers, or even a scope and ULM for those casters who need the low weight and scope to accurately place their powers. The gun can literally be purposed to fit into every build in some capacity.

____________________________________________________
*Miscellaneous*

**The gun is more fun once you stop whining about it**- Once you get over the fact you didn't get a Crusader/Valiant/Hurricane

**It also is a great gun with friends**- Even if your friends still believe that the Eagle is total rubbish

____________________________________________________

And that is why you should give the N7 Eagle a second go. It's versatility is both its greatest strength and weakness. Slap it onto a power based class to get the best results out of the Eagle.

1349983405.0,11bozf,Tactics for taking on the Collectors,dickcake,36,0,48,"So

**You can't camp the Collectors**

Best strategy so far seems to be to stay together

**Swarmers are high priority targets**

If you don't take out the swarms before they get to you

**Pop the sacks on the Scions**

Popping the Scions' sacks debuffs and staggers them.  They're mostly visible from behind but there is one on the left shoulder that you can target from in front of them.  Bring on the snipers!

**Stay away from Possessed Abominations**

In PUGs

Then again

**Medi-Gel Transmitter is a great crutch**

The Medi-Gel Transmitter is very helpful during these learning times.  In most of the PUGs I've played against Collectors, if you have them.

**Praetorians have a soft spot in front

I haven't confirmed this myself

Subject: Assigned tasks for the four-man fireteam

Men

**Male Quarian Infiltrator** *""Team!""*

You're the team leader. Identify a target with Tactical Scan

**Geth Infiltrator** *""Ready!""*

You are the designated scout. Be sure to utilize the Proximity Mine

**Asari Justicar** *""Fire!""*

When the enemies begin to pour in, in charge if the fireteam leader has to make a stealth rescue mission for a downed scout.

**Turian Sentinel** *""Assist!""*

Overload should be utilized to remove enemy shielding. Once shields are down, bring a powerful gun and keep firing. In addition, you should be the one gathering data for the ""retrieve"" objectives, given your higher durability.

By combining the exposing effect of scan, and warp, the defenses of enemy commander units should be practically non-existent. The scout and fireteam leader should ensure that the target is properly identified and weakened, then focus on crowd suppression. I want to see fireworks, people. Make me proud.

Hackett out.

There's surprising depth in this game - but the game requires you to know a lot of things to play effectively. This is just one of the many things that frustrates me:

**People always try to shoot the floating / glowing enemy first**

This isn't optimal because he's going to be the detonator for the combo explosion 2 seconds later. This leads me to believe that most people actually don't know how biotic combos work. When I started

I'm not hating on noobs, and has no idea what hack does.

&gt;This is not a weapon with a tactical purpose
&gt;
&gt;The highlight of this weapon is its powerful single shot capacity. It dishes out incredible damage at the expense of any resemblance of fire rate or accuracy. This makes the weapon almost exclusively manageable at extremely close distances, such as the N7 Fury or Krogan Shaman. This is a weapon you intend to only shoot once or twice a round between cool downs.
&gt;
&gt;The Executioner seeks out a particularly overly confident enemy we all plan for in every loadout, the Guardian is a slow and cocky enemy and will willingly allow a player to strut up against their shields, take careful aim, ask for spare change, and fire right through the pizza boxes they think will protect them from bullets. The first time you blow a Guardians face out the back of their heads you’ll never look at that cute little Blood Pack Skull on the side of this weapon the same again.
&gt;
&gt;And it doesn’t end there. This weapon will make you squeal with joy when you pop a one-off shot on an Atlas triggering it’s VI System to reevaluate itself as an overcooked Hot Pocket. The weapons weaknesses and nuances will make you appreciate every kill you earn with it. So put that pistol scope mod away and earn those bloody headshots. Just please, and they thought it was *awesome*.

[**THE BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/NSlayer/RMAOK/Wraith10BG5AM5//StrengthEnhancer3/PowerAmplifierModule4/HydraulicJoints5/)

The theory behind slayer builds is basically Biotic Slash, let's go ahead and slay biotic slash. The reason you don't want biotic slash on a slayer is that it's completely counterintuitive to an action-focused vanguard build. When I play a vanguard, the first thing I think of isn't, ""All right, time to stand behind a wall and spam a button as I slowly chip away at enemies,"" it's, ""Motherfucker I am about to get **IN THERE.**"" People tout biotic slash as a highly useful power that can detonate multiple biotic explosions and has above-average base damage. You know what other powers do pretty much the exact same thing? Smash and shockwave. You know what classes with smash and shockwave don't have? A space sword and a palm cannon of death. Yeah. I don't understand why anyone would waste all the potential coolness of this class when they could fulfill the same functional role as a BS-specced slayer on like 4 other classes. Finally, in-game perspective. The frame data on biotic slash is abysmal. It has almost a second of startup before the power actually comes out where the slayer is a complete sitting duck to get shot, etc. On gold

So with my new graphics card I can handle recording 720p video during gameplay now. Since this is a class that pretty much entirely eliminates the RPG aspect of Mass Effect to focus on action-oriented gameplay (it's practically Devil May Cry at this point)

As the video hopefully demonstrates, and melee work with each other is flowing and seamless, a trifecta of powers that possibly have the highest synergy with each other in the entire game. The way it works is basically this: phase disruptor drains your barriers, biotic charge restores them, and melee combos provide extremely high damage reduction during biotic charge's cooldown. The damage reduction is so insane that the only thing that can really kill you if you're melee comboing after a charge is getting staggered or grab-killed. You'll notice in the video that I can charge turrets, combo them, and only lose about 1/4 of my shields to their sustained fire over the entire duration. Even with omni-blade equipped, allowing you to charge again immediately after you lose the damage reduction. So really the simplest way to play this class is just to charge, and repeat over and over until everything's dead. It's also the safest way to reliably stay alive (unless enemies with grab kills are involved), do a melee combo to buy yourself some time and decrease your squishiness. The more advanced stuff that comes with time is knowing when you can get away with throwing phase disruptors and heavy melees in there

Before going in-depth I want to take a second to discuss **keybinds, although you won't be able to rotate the camera with the right thumbstick during your melee combo so you can search for a new target to charge the instant it ends, which puts you at a slight disadvantage. Still very doable though.

Now that we've got that out of the way, the whole reason to play slayer at all is looking cool. You want substance over style, I've got a nice fembot with a reegar carbine sitting here on the class selection screen for you. But if you want to be a slayer that slays, you should be killing with heavy melee whenever you can get away with it. The tricky part is knowing when you can get away with it, and that's what I'm here to help with. Basically if you still have enemies firing at you and you go for a HM kill, you're almost certainly not surviving those vulnerable recovery frames. You need to kill all the enemies in the visible area around you, then slay the last one. The benefit you get from successfully slaying is not simply being able to go, how fucking awesome am I?"" either. The martial artist perk sends you into hyper mode, and you can be killed or even sync-killed during the teleport animation as well. If you're just starting out playing the class, **WAIT** for a brief moment for them to start to recover from their stagger

Next we'll cover **phase disruptor**, and will end up being your primary way of fighting bosses like brutes, banshees, scions, praetorians, and atlases that have the danger of sync-killing you. Any time you're dealing with these enemies, as well as more than one phantom at a time, teleport backwards out of grab range, and atlases since they have to perform a melee attack before they can grab you. A lot of times your charge will bait out this melee attack. All you have to do is make sure *not* to charge them again after they do it until they start up a different attack; then you're safe to charge them again. It is *not* 100% safe against teleporting banshees. There is a very low chance that you will charge them and instantly be grabbed

With **phantoms**, but if you're going 1v1 against them or have other enemies shooting at you from a distance, the charge &gt; phase disruptor &gt; light melee combo is almost completely safe as well. They follow the rule of having to hit you with a regular melee before they can sync-kill, and since Your PDs and charge will stagger them, you'll usually get them down to health before they even have a chance to swing at you, which forces them to go invisible and be unable to attack. The really nice thing about the light melee combo is that as long as they're ""targeted (highlighted by the red box)"" when you start mashing your melee key, it will stay locked onto them and keep hitting them automatically even when they cloak and start flipping around. This is demonstrated several times in the video; phantoms almost never survive the light melee combo. For 2 or more phantoms at once though, which will stagger you, which also happens at least once. In another game

The real beauty of this class is that it's extremely possible to go the **entire game without firing a single shot from your gun, line up with their head, and *pop*. One-and-done. Technically I guess you could use it for priming fire/cryo/tech explosions on bosses, but I don't even bother. The damage ammo explosions do is rather inconsequential, and I'd rather just be spamming phase disruptor at maximum speed and charging to get shields back rather than alternating between weapons fire and PD. If you have tech teammates playing with you it will detonate their combos anyway, which will be more powerful than ammo explosions.

I used to be afraid to play this class against anyone but geth because of sync kills, whereas the more boss-heavy nature of reapers and collectors means that you'll spend more time using phase disruptor while dealing with brutes, banshees, scions, and praetorians, only using melee to deal with troopers and ravagers when no sync-killers are closing in on you. You've got to be real careful about doing melee combos against cannibals and marauders vs. reapers, as they keep you locked in place for a few seconds where you can have a brute charge you from the side or a banshee teleport up to you and sync-kill. Only melee combo when you know the bosses are far enough away that they won't be able to reach you before you finish.

One final thing: the amount of damage reduction your melee combo gives you can be deceptive about this class's survivability; without it, it's not to carry packages, it's to **slay everything you see.** Trying to revive teammates or do objectives often will only result in you getting yourself killed. It's a much better idea and overall contribution to the team to try and kill everything in the area around the objective or downed teammate, allowing tankier characters or infiltrators to have an easier time reviving or carrying the package. This is true for most vanguards, but perhaps most relevant on this class.

I think that should about cover everything, **host your own lobby** (absolutely required), gear up, and get to slaying.",[Build],False,self,1366397870.0,t3_1copc0

1361838444.0,198581,Crowdsourcing ME3 Store Drop Rates - Part Trois,InterwebNinja,39,6,56,"Hey folks - the new DLC is upon us and I'd like to collect some more data from folks that are willing to help out.  This time around

####USERS TAB

First of all, that's great.  What I need, though, is a disclosure of what you intend to keep track of.  There are two tabs - the first is 'Users'.  Here, record your reddit ID (no need to disclose platform unless you are playing more than one), and mark the state of your manifest.  This should be the state immediately before you buy your first pack.  Assuming you intend to start recording your purchases shortly after the DLC is released, you should no longer have a maxed UR / Rare weapon or character manifest.  In addition to recording that

Note

####DROP LOG TAB

The 'Drop Log' tab is where you can record your purchases.  You can either record your packs one by one, or several at the same time.  It should be fairly self-explanatory.  No need to put zeros in the things you don't get - just fill out the quantities for the goods that you have chosen to track.  Note, I'm not putting consumables on here because those mechanics are well understood.  If you max your consumables and start getting equipment in those slots, don't include that equipment in this spreadsheet.

The rightmost column of this spreadsheet is where you should record whenever you max a portion of your manifest.  For instance, just make a note like 'Rare Characters' in this column on the pack that maxed them out.  If you're doing a big dump of data in a single row, make a note like 'Rare Characters (25)'.  If you don't record this information, the drop rates are going to be understated for these goods.

Technically, or it can happen for 'Reset Powers'.  In particular, if you're keeping track of the 'Reset Powers', you'll have to keep meticulous track of when you max it out (i.e. get up to 3 of them), or when you unmax it (i.e. use one of them).  Just record this if you intend on tracking that good.

####WHAT TO BUY / TRACK

People have been asking what I'm interested in collecting, the question of UR drop rates is still difficult to nail down, especially with the Reserve and Arsenal packs.  There is some evidence that, even on non-DLC days, these packs have the best value.  So, it would be really helpful if people collect UR rates for these packs, and I'd be really appreciate if people continue to log these purchases well after the DLC has dropped.  I'm also interested in Uncommon Weapon Mods / Gear in all packs

As for recommendations on what to buy for the best values, if you care about URs, then it might be worth gambling on Arsenals / Reserves / PSPs.  Those packs have all seen a boost on day-of-DLC in the past, although there is no guarantee that they will again.  Personally, I'm going to be sticking with Reserve / Arsenal packs.

####MISCELLANEOUS / SUMMARY

One final thing is that I'd recommend keeping a local log of your purchasing.  There is some risk that this spreadsheet gets mucked up somehow, and then copy them directly into mine.

Thanks for anything you are willing to contribute!  If you have any questions

***Edit***:  In case this isn't obvious, should you choose to continue contributing.  If you go on a really good UR run, and then remember - oh hey, I should be recording this, that will introduce bias.  You should decide before spending money on packs whether you intend to record it or not.  So long as you follow that guideline, that particular source of bias should not be a problem.

***Edit 2***:  On the topic of logging when you max a portion of your manifest, it is important to know the order in which you bought the packs.  For this reason, I'd recommend recording your packs one by one, in the order that you buy them.  Otherwise, the numbers get mucked up.  You don't have to do this on the shared spreadsheet, but at least do so locally, if you can afford the time.  That way, you should be able to provide data that will clear up the issue.",t5_2tkk1,True

1359579039.0,17kzue,Your Friendly Neighborhood Phantom (N7 Slayer Build),spark2,40,3,30,"**INTRO**

Vanguards are an interesting bunch. Some are built around meleeing/tanking (Brawler, and some do better with weapons (Asari Vanguard). The N7 Slayer is usually built in one of two ways: [staggeriffic](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11hs40/staggermaster_n7_slayer/) or [pure melee](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11oql7/the_space_samurai_or_how_to_melee_build_slayer/). Those are great ways to build him, and I love them both to death. However, with the recent buffs to Phase Disruptor, I believe that another style is viable. Namely, using his impressive set of power buffs to amp his newly buffed PD through the roof. Here's how to do it.

[**BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/NSlayer/RMDIO/Acolyte1AG5AJ5/////)

* **Biotic Charge**: One of the best skills in the game on certain classes, and his heavy melee, he is *the* single most mobile kit in the game. Use this mobility to jump in and out of bad situations and stagger enemies around you. Take Radius to keep you safe and to damage more enemies, and power synergy to amp up further BC's and PD's. Barrier because of course.

* **Phase Disruptor**: The best part about this guy. They just buffed it to drain less shields per cast, is awesome. It's got impressive damage and can control a group of enemies while your BC recharges. You're generally going to want to shoot it at the ground near enemies to make sure you don't miss. Take damage, since you'll be spamming it enough that Radius will take care of itself. Take efficient blast, for more shots. It'll give you five shots before needing to recharge if you're not being shot at. Finally, take Armor Damage to help against bosses. This is your bread and butter, to use a cliche. Use it often, and Charge to recharge your shields and keep spamming.

* **Biotic Slash**: Meh. I go three points in just for style points and because I don't need the rank 6 evo on the class passive. Use it through walls only.

* **Passives**: Straight power damage on offensive passives (easy enough). Fitness is where things get fun. I recommend that you take Krogan spec: Durability, which is nothing to sneeze at at all. Only use it when safe though-- isolated enemies only, as it leaves you open for counterattack. Also note that his HM will whiff on anyone who is staggering backwards, so let them recover before you cut their heads off-- it's only sporting. His light melee is also fantastic, and also gets amped by his heavy melee. It gives you (i think) 50% DR while doing it, which combined with Charge's temporary DR lets you be surprisingly tanky. He's no Brawler, but it's pretty damn respectable.

* **Weapons**: You just need something to take care of shields. Acolyte or Talon are your best bet
If you want to support more and have teammates that can take care of shields for you, run PB/AP, otherwise go PB/Stunner.

* **Gear**: Take Martial Biotic if you feel comfortable with your level of tankiness, you can take BatGauntlets to boost your damage and give a much better animation, which will significantly improve his playability. Power Amps are nice, Strength boosters are also nice, and elemental ammo + Acolyte + PD = explosions galore.

**STRATEGY**

It's a pretty simple combo. Just BC a spawn (preferably one without sync killers, and PD them into oblivion while they can't move. Heavy melee when you can, to get the power buff.

This guy synergizes fantastically with just about any team-- he can detonate tech explosions with PD

If you want more info on his fantastically awesome dodge

The Friendly Phantom is awesome against Cerberus, so careful against them. Reapers aren't too bad for the most part, but Banshees will wreck your shit. Stay far away from them.

Lastly

This is just a brief guide on the sort of hybrid power/melee way that I play my Slayer. Try it out if it seems cool

1359476847.0,17i2jw,How to solo on console. ,Salsadips,50,16,54,"So cledio_ify1 posted the novel that is his soloing guide. If anyone is serious about soloing

For example

I have recently just gotten into soloing. With inspiration from cledio_ifys post. 

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go3fOtxTPdo) is my first attempt. It also showcases some pretty damn awesome music aswell as the appalling console loading screens.

You will see in that video how defensive I am with the novaguard. I actually cut a few bits out just because all I was doing was running away from stuff to isolate them before killing them. Anyone who has played any game with me will know that I am a crazy aggressive player

I cannot stress enough how important running away is. There is no field of view adjustment, no lightning fast response times. Awareness is not as easily increased as it is on PC.  As a player of both console and PC, the console really is shit tier in comparison in terms of how efficiently you can do things. 

So just to summarize, stay in cover and stay away from sync killing enemies as much as possible. Console is very... inconsistent in terms of amount of bullshit that happens. Phantoms and Banshees are lethal unless isolated. Even then they will most likely shit all over your attempts. Take a lot of time to solo on console. The loading screens alone will set you back a few days. 

Conclusion: If you want a well written walkthrough guide

I've left out uncommon gear as there was almost no data on them.  I'm assuming most people here have their Uncommon guns and characters maxed, sleepyelephant).

As you can see, which is not far off from what people have anecdotally claimed in the past for SPs.  So, how does this match up with the value for PSPs?

It's not even close, and we're now looking at a 95% chance that the expected number of URs per PSP is between 0.14 and ~~0.22~~ 0.21 (thanks to rhyshawkins for adding another huge volume of PSPs to the dataset).  And, keep in mind, the chance that it's 0.175 is *much, much* higher than the chance that it's 0.14.  We can also rule out the odds that the rate is lower than 0.12 as pretty much negligible.

So,000 spent on SPs yields 1 UR, and only 550,000 on PSPs does the same.  Even if we look at the more unlikely cases where we've observed anomalous data, the two don't even out on credits spent until you assume something like PSPs drop URs at a 15% rate and SPs drop them at a 10% rate (both scenarios that are looking increasingly unlikely).

**Krysae sniper rifle**

[One isn't using this gun. Guess which one. Just fyi

Krysae + Firebase white + geth = industrial level farming (As the picture clearly shows).

With regards to balancing, maybe even 1. Else, the damage just needs reducing.

**Combat drone**

The is literally no reason whatsoever to use this. Why is a power like this even available? Needs a serious buff. 

**Turian and Batarians**

In my opinion, but I am less drawn to it because of the movement penalty. The Krogan however, I can understand, for its sheer ability to absorb ammo.

**Assault rifles and SMGs [Excluding N7 weapons]**

Again, or at least introduce a damage drop off which makes it very effective close range, but more or less useless at medium to long range. Another idea I had would be the ability to ARs a mod which allows it to detonate biotic/tech combos. This would make it a very versatile weapon, as assault rifles should be. 

**Geth plasma shotgun**

Not a huge concern of mine, but I do think the clip size could be reduced to 3 instead of 5.

**Drell vanguard**

If you want cluster grenades

**One hit kill enemies**

Not really an issue as such, or just *something* to prevent the insta-deaths caused by a phantom sneaking up behind you or the banshee tractor beam.

***Weapons***

The Hurricane. You all know why you have this. Bosses. Onwards.

The motherfucking FALCON. A shadow of its former self for those who remember when this gun was brokenly OP. Bioware was subject to a mass outcry to people declaring the Falcon dead to never be used again. Which of course was stupid. The Falcon is still a god tier weapon for those who use it and id consider it one of the best ARs in the game. 

*'But Salsa

Lets continue.

[This is a Harrier](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YkFIvO1VfrY/TFj6BpCCuEI/AAAAAAAAT5I/73TMtwEhbPA/s1600/Montagu's-Harrier-melanisti.jpg).

[This is a Falcon](http://lsd.dula.tv/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Falcon-Kick.jpg). 

Whose side are you on now?    

The correct answer is the Falcons. 

**'But what about the Striker?! You can missile glitch better with that!'** ....*sigh*. 

Now back to gameplay. The Falcon has HUGE crowd control. The best in the game. Only pre-nerf Krysae rivalled it. Perhaps the best argument to why you should use this weapon is that it simple trivializes Phantoms and Dragoons

The other similarity the Falcon shares with the Krysae is its proximity based detonation. Therefore you don't even 'need' to aim. Just lob a ball in the enemies general direction and you will score a hit and a primed enemy

***Ammo Powers***

This is a no brainer. Disruptor or Incendiary. You could get away with Cryo aswell but you won't nearly be as effective IMO. If you are fighting Geth, I prefer Incendiary personally because it works better with the hurricane for Fatlases. Reapers - Incendiary is a must. Try to avoid reapers if you can. Too many large armoured targets. The same goes for collectors in the later waves. You will be using the Hurricane more if you happen to get either of these factions.

No reason to use any other ammo power as the Falcon ignores armour reduction anyway

___

***Overload***

Shields? What shields? VS shielded humanoids, I prefer the more spammable overload personally. 6th is optional too. Choose Chain overload for more asplosions. However, one shotting shields on stuff is often a more useful choice in general. 

___

***Hunter Mode*** 

A very run of the mill hunter mode. 4th evo is optional though for the gethgineer because it actually has a power on a cooldown. So thats your choice to make. I personally use accuracy because I use a lot of different weapons with my engi and I don't fancy respeccing every time I choose another weapon. Rate of fire so you can floop more floops. Speed and vision because you get a much more survivable unit
___

***Passives***

If you want to put three in here and 5 in turret buddy

___

***Fitness***

Another no brainer. Full health and shield bonuses.

___

***Equipment***

Cyclonic mod + AR amp are self explanatory. Shield power cells is also a good option. Barrage gear helps with Hurricanes lulwut recoil and also grants you some extra ammo for your Falcon

___

Here you go. You are now the [stagger master](http://i.imgur.com/QCZNEY7.jpg). Enjoy.

###Introduction

Bored of using guns? Want to reduce your enemies into goo? Do you like playing risky for the priiiiize? Then the *new and improved* Geth Glass Cannon may be right for you! Gold viable

[*Geth Glass Cannon? Do you mean this build?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15ayke/geth_infiltrator_the_real_glass_cannon/)

Nope. This is the original GGC

*But why should I play a melee infiltrator when I have a perfectly good Javelin X over here?*

Good question! Can Javelin X take out 3 Phantoms or Dragoons in less than a second? This guy can. While Javelin would be superior in single-target DPS

Before we go on

###[Build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Geth/MOKAK/Wraith4BG5BH5///AdrenalineModule3/HydraulicJoints5/)

Some parts of the [build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Geth/MOKAK/Wraith4BG5BH5///AdrenalineModule3/HydraulicJoints5/) are optional.

* *Tactical Cloak*: **Duration,* I hear you say, *surely that's madness!* Bonus Power is actually very useful for GGC. I'll explain that more in a bit.

* *Proximity Mine*: **Radius, since we'll be able to two-shot every enemy other than Atlases and Primes anyways. It's for staggering groups of enemies (so that you can safely run into and melee without them hitting you first) and debuffing Atlases and Primes when we engage them. Bonus Power of TC makes sure that we have time to position ourselves after the PM to deliver the burst melees in the most safe and efficient manner.

* *Hunter Mode*: **Power Recharge, and Power Damage is more useful in my opinion because you will be using Proximity Mine more than your gun. However, if you don't like them, change them as you see fit.

* *Networked AI*: Skip it. This might be one build in the entire universe that actually skips the race passive entirely. If you don't want the final evolution in PM

* *Fitness*: **Melee Damage

* *Weapon*: a light shotgun that can pierce through cover/Guardian shield. Shredder/High-Velocity Barrel is suggested. Omni-blade V is a must (Blade Attachment V is fine for Silver

* *Gear*: **Hydraulics V.** 20% extra damage is nothing to scoff at.

* *Consumables*: **Adrenaline Module**

###How to Play Part 1: Offense

**The basics** of GGC is very simple: Cloak, run away, repeat until enemies are dead. Your priority targets are groups of small boss units, such as Geth Pyro and Phantoms. Find one or a group of them, double heavy melee and they should be dead. However, **there are a few enemies that need special treatment:**

**Guardians**: Their shield will block your heavy melee. Either sneak up behind them and melee (running past him also works

**Atlas/Prime**: Your DPS is still great against both of these enemies

**Turrets**: High priority targets. With these around, then give them a big synthetic-to-synthetic hug. Upon their death, they cause an explosion that will stagger you. You can avoid it by keeping the Turret just at the edge of your AoE.

**Geth Bombers**: If they're flying toward you after a bombing run, burst melee.

**Geth Rocket Troopers**: If it has already ""targeted"" you or you have its attention

Also

*A special exception about Phantoms. Phantom's hand of denial/bubble shield protects them from your heavy melee. Sometimes

##Burst Melee

So I've been throwing this term around

~~I don't know if this is PC only feature

**So how do you do this?** You first sprint forward. When you want to melee, hit melee again, but this time WITHOUT holding the sprint key (you are still holding the forward key). This will trigger your heavy melee twice in one second.

This is a pretty confusing description. I'll upload a video of my hand movements if highly requested.

Please keep in mind that this **burst melee works best on-host**

###How to Play Part 2: Survival

This is much more difficult than offense and much more important.

You're the very definition of a glass cannon. You have a huge (especially burst) DPS, you will get hurt, and eventually you'll be running around with 1 bar of health left. You're gonna be running around with less than 300 health for the majority of the game? That's squisher than a Level 1 Drell Adept.

Your lack of shield and health means that you have to rely on other ways for your survival.

* Use **Hunter Mode** to see your surroundings and make sound decisions

* **Tactical Cloak and lightning fast Sprint** will be your lifeblood. A lot of people (including me) often forget that TC isn't just for damage boost. Use it to escape hairy situations. Don't worry about cooldowns; your cooldown is already very low

* Geth Hop. Learn to use it.

* Use cover as often as possible. Obvious tip

* **Play safe

* So you went down. Help isn't coming anytime soon, and a Phantom is surrounding you. **As you get up, heavy melee (hold the melee key) to stun or stagger the surrounding enemies**. It will give you just enough breathing room to dash away with a TC.

**Just keep in mind that as you learn this class

###How to Play Part 3: Teamwork

While teamwork or synergy is not very important for this class

##Teamwork

* Your speed and duration of TC makes you a great medic. Dart in, then dash away.

* Your Hunter Mode with Speed &amp; Vision, use it to keep your allies informed.

##Synergy

* GGC synergize best with tanks. Tanks, letting you make short work of them.

* GGC synergize well with snipers. Snipers can provide long range support and they wont get in your way while you frantically run amongst your enemies. Bonus points if they're infiltrators

* GGC does not conflict with biotic and tech classes. The heavy melee and PM do not prime (but the PM detonates tech explosions)

* GGC does not synergize well with Vorchas, it is very easy for you to accidentally ""kill steal"" from them. You will see me doing this several times to the ally Vorcha.

##Objectives

* 4-Point Objective is your forte. Duration in TC and high speed will let you hack without much hinderance.

* For the same reasons

* Assassination missions are okay. Targets get extra damage resistance

* Hack objectives are a hit or a miss. If you can find a good cover, Pyro, or a Dragoon to ruin your hack, since you can take them down the instant they enter the circle. On the other hand, you have very little medium and long-range offense other than the PM debuff.

* Drone Recovery missions are probably the worst. The drone forces you to lose the two abilities you depend on most: your speed and TC. The drone loses you when you enter cloak, play support and keep the area around the drone clear of enemies. If not, just cross your fingers and carry the drone.

And then I thought again and realized that Seeker Swarm is a slightly weaker version of tech armor.

It provides a 40% DR when fully spec'd out. 

Not only that, turians, juggernaut, and destroyer. 

So when fully put into swarm and fitness

That isn't the only thing about him. The other thing about him is that his signature power

What does this mean? You don't have to worry about weight. You are a weapon master

Why is this ability so nifty? Two words: Warp ammo.

Warp ammo is an ammo power that offers a significant bonus to enemies that have been primed by a power. That means that when you prime enemies with dark sphere

Now the Claymore has a few qualities to it. The first is that with a smart choke it is fairly accurate. Not incredibly

A headshot with a claymore will kill almost any mook on gold. The only things are armored enemies and phantoms. 

Your dark sphere+ warp ammo combo will do massive damage to anything else. Combine it with headshots for maximum sucess

You have durability

Really any weapon will work. I've even ran with -200% cooldown with success. The key thing is warp ammo and cyclonic mod helps a lot.

Powers:
Dark Sphere:
Essentially most of these evolutions don't do much for you. The final evolutions helps it so that way you can prime as many people as possible. This also helps any biotic teammates as you can mass prime things to be exploded. Combine it with a well timed shockwave and you can have a nice large explosion.

The explosion damage could be switched

The duration of the power is essentially your cooldown due to it not creating a cooldown as long as you don't detonate it. keep the duration as low as possible so you can spam it when it is needed.


EDIT: Take DoT over recharge. It lasts 10 seconds no matter what. 

Swarm:
Put this up right when the match starts. recharge will help you get to be able to cast dark sphere earlier on really high cooldown rates. Slow would work if you are willing to face a long cooldown when your reapply the swarms. 

Take DR as it is your tech armor and an extra orb is extra DR.

Dark channel: skip this. It is single target and your cooldown will suck. 

Passive: Full weapon damage and headshot damage. You get a lot of damage from this tree. If you like the PPR or collector weapons

Personally I don't do well with Collector weapons

Fitness: You need all the health and shields you can get.

---

A common technique for improving the odds of specific drops is to temporarily remove or uninstall any DLC that is not relevant. When purchasing store packs

Be aware that a player will temporarily lose access to a DLC's characters, until that DLC is reinstalled. This is important if players want to farm credits and spend at the same time, as they will be restricted in play options.

**XBox:** Go into the system settings &gt; storage screen and either delete the DLCs or move them to an external drive. If deleted they'll need to redownload them after spending credits. If moved to an external drive

**PS3:** The game is consolidated into a single file. The only way to remove DLC is to start fresh. Delete the game and re-install. If a digital copy was purchased through PSN, if the player ever needs to remove specific DLC. It will save time and bandwidth.

**WII-U:** This technique is not possible on this platform. Players can only purchase the WII-U Special Edition in hard copy format. The first 3 multiplayer DLCs (Resurgence, there are no settings or files that can be manipulated.

1360859695.0,18is0z,Mecoop College 605: Debuffs and Buffs,I_pity_the_fool,39,7,28,"##Introductory Questions

**How do debuffs work?** Debuffs in this game are added together on top of the something peddroelmz calls the headshot mod. So if I hit someone with incinerate for 900 damage, I do (900 * 1.45) 1305 damage. If someone hits that person with a headshot with their grall spike thrower for 2138 damage, they'll do (2138 * (3 + 0.45)) 7376 damage. The headshot mod is the headshot multiplier of the weapon (usually 2.5, but sometimes 3 or 1) if the damage was from a weapon headshot, or one otherwise (source: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13807232/1)

The extra damage taken will apply to all damage - power, melee etc. The exception to this is the rank 4 perk in tactical scan which provides bonuses only to power or weapon damage. 

**Do they stack from the same player?** No.

**Do they stack from different players?** Generally, but all others - as far as I'm aware - do. All the debuffs are added together and applied to the headshot mod.

**How do debuff powers like warp and cryo blast affect armor?** In the description it says that warp ""weakens enemy armor by 25%"" - what does this mean? When you fire at a target with armor, and all of these *armor weakening* powers debuff enemy armor for all players.

**How does this effect interact with armor piercing effects from AP ammo or piercing mods?** The interact multiplicatively. If I have a mod that reduces enemy armor by 65%

**Do debuffs to movement speed also slow attack speed?** Probably. I don't think it has been tested

**If a banshee uses the hand of denial or a phantom puts her bubble up, even if they can't actually be damaged by powers. We need a source for this claim though.

Discussion of shield boost and recon mine in the discussion below comes from my thread on the volus engineer.

##Various powers

Quite a lot of powers have debuff effects somewhere in their trees - warp, snap freeze, annihilation field, submission net, dark channel, stasis, and cryo and warp ammos. Most of them work fairly conventionally

The rank 6 debuff for biotic orbs, so if you smash three orbs onto a target the final one will do 30% extra damage.

The description for warp is fairly honest but confusing nonetheless. It tells you it increases weapon and power damage. It does exactly that - ammo equipment damage (say

There's a rumor that if you choose the debuffing option in rank 6 of stasis (the non-bubble one)

&gt; there's a bug with stasis. In-game verbatim: ""Increase all damage done to target by 50%. Deal 35% more damage to target before Stasis breaks."" Stasis actually only debuffs targets by 35%. It is assumed the numbers were mixed up.

I'd remind you also that warp and cryo ammo - being armor *weakening* effects - weaken armor for the entire team.

##Cryo Blast

The power freezes solid targets who are down to health and slows down others. The freezing effect will take a second or two to manifest. The power sets up cryo explosions only on targets that are frozen.

The power has 150N base force. [Here](http://pastebin.com/wXKyLYQJ) is what that will staggar. It inflicts no base damage, can't detonate tech explosions.

Even with the radius upgrade it won't affect more than 2 targets.

There's a variable ""speedreductiondurationmult"" in the coalesced file. I speculate that targets are slowed down for longer than they're completely frozen

Damage taken debuffs are in rank 5 and 6. Bioware could perhaps add an increase to damage taken to the base power - there's a variable called ""damagetakenbonus"" set to 0 in the coalesced file. We don't know if this capability was actually implemented though.

Why is the evolution ""cryo explosion"" called that when it actually has nothing to do with cryo explosions? I suspect that originally the rank 5 perk ""cryo explosion"" would make the enemy explode on death

If you use cryo blast on a target with shields

##Biotic Sphere

Casting the sphere does 100 damage and applies 1500N of force to any enemies in range. It also detonates biotic explosions. There used to be a bug where you had to look at the ground in order to cast a sphere if there was an opponent nearby - you couldn't cast if you were targeting an enemy. This was fixed in patch 1.04: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/324/index/14311106.

The sphere lasts for 30 seconds and has a 3m radius at base.

The warp effect applied by the evolution in rank 6 does 100 base damage, and - contrary to BSN rumours - counts as a rank 6 power for biotic explosions. An unlisted effect is that it weakens enemy armor by 25%.

Debuffs (and probably buffs) from more than one sphere do not stack

##Shield Boost

Shield boost restores a large initial lump of shields for all players in range

Spamming this power, ""I'm hit!"", and ""PAAAIN!""

* whatever choices you make on other ranks, you may want to read this article on how DR works - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15699700/. Summary: enemies do (base enemy damage * difficulty multiplier) * ((either 1 or 1.4 depending on whether you're in cover) - (the sum of your damage reduction. example: 0.4 tech armor + 0.5 shield boost))
* Shield boost and the volus heavy melee will together give you two seconds of damage immunity and around 95% real DR. I've survived a meltdown in the hazard reactor using this - give it a try! Spoiler: the room goes a lovely pure white
* Shield boost, or squadmates going through ravager puddles.
* Characters have a shorter shield recharge time if their shields have not been completely destroyed. Because shield boost restores a small amount of shields for 3 seconds after cast
* The description for evolution 6 of shield boost says that damage reduction is capped at 90%. According to tyhw on the BSN
* There's a bug with shield boost. Having a volus near you activate it while you're reloading causes you to be locked out of powers and firing your gun. Volus affected by this bug are locked out of heavy melee as well. The cure is to heavy melee. Falling off a ledge also works.
* The amount of shields delivered in a lump on activation is a little strange - unlike the extra shields over 3 seconds, and confirmed that it is not merely a glitch in the powers screen - you actually do get those shields.
* Using shield boost gives the volus immunity to damage for 1.5 seconds.

##Tac Scan

This power has one of the shortest cooldowns in the game. Only one tac scan can be applied to a target at the same time. It also has the largest single target debuff in the game (up to 32.5% for either weapon or power damage) and one of the longest durations. I'm inclined to count it therefore as the best single target debuff in the game.

The power has a rather nice synergy with marksman. Unlike proximity mine

The rank 5 headshots perk does not work (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13807232)

The rank 6 area scan perk will show up all enemies within 20m of the target for 3 seconds. If no enemy is targetted

The power damage bonus in rank 4 applies also to grenade damage. It's unknown if it applies to power combo damage (I would guess not). The main 10-15% damage bonus

A little readout on your character's wrist tells you how far away your enemy is in meters. It may come as a surprise to you that quarians use meters

The power has a fairly long animation that can get you into trouble. To get around this

##Recon Mine

A power which with the right evolution produces a fairly large debuff in a substantial AoE

You can deploy the mine to walls

* The explosion isn't blocked by cover, and put up another 3 and a half seconds after that.
* Recon Mine's debuff takes effect after the mine has armed (that is
* The explosion hits for a base force of 1500N 
* The slow part of the debuff evolution in rank 6 is deceptively useful. Frequently you can arrange for an entire spawn point to be slowed down while you help the rest of the team with the objectives. Taking 5 of the eight enemies out of circulation is very helpful. This is also quite useful for your teammates' AoE attacks (although on objective waves it would be even better if they just left the buggers alone and sat quietly in the hack circle). The slow evolution comes with a fantastic 25% debuff as well.
* Recon mine + proxy mine does not exactly nuke spawns
* Recon mine debuffs from different players do not stack: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14108056#14108056

##Sabotage's Rank 6 Evolution ""Tech Vulnerability""

The rank 6 perk in sabotage that increases tech damage by 50% applies to tech bursts as well (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13855086/4#14041115). Remember that sabotage only sets up a tech burst after 1.5 seconds - that is

It also affects the heavy melees of the turian saboteur engineer and the female quarian infiltrator (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13855086/5#14143827)

It does not affect:

* Homing Grenade damage
* Sentry turret attacks (apart from the shock attack - this is the only attack to get the benefit of this sabotage evolution)
* Turian saboteur engineer's light melee.
* Sticky grenade damage (these are combat powers)

**Geth Trooper**

The basic assault trooper.  A cousin to the assault trooper in terms of use and damage.  Cannot stun (Applause).  Equipped with a Geth Pulse Rifle, but watch out, they have insane DPS, especially at higher difficulties.

**Geth Rocket Trooper**

Upgrade to the Geth Trooper.  Has a shield and a rocket launcher

**Geth Hunter**

These guys are bastards.  Hunters have shields, go up behind you, stun you with a blast from their shotgun, de-cloak, and sit while you get destroyed by the Geth Rocket Troopers, Primes, Pyros and Troopers you forgot about.  And the best part?  THEY CAN SHOOT YOU IF YOU STAGGER THEM.  Be careful.

**Geth Pyro**

Easily identified due to the huge tank on its back and its yellow coloration.  Has shields and armor, primes, rocket troopers, and bombers get you out of cover, a pack of pyros will roast you to hell.  and then stomp you.  Because they can do that.  Fuckers.

**Geth Bomber**

Another staggering geth unit, and attacks with either a. a shock-like melee attack that stuns you or b. a bombing run that stuns you and can go through gates I believe.  Did I mention that it's tiny and can DODGE LoS ATTACKS?  High priority - if you can hit it.  Use guns.

**Geth Prime**

You didn't think I'd forget about him, his melee can STUN YOU OUT OF A BIOTIC CHARGE.  I shit you not.  It also hurts a lot.  His second is his cannon/shotgun which can SNIPE YOU ACROSS THE MAP, stunning you and dealing damage.  His third and fourth are his two pets, which can spawn either next to him or BEHIND YOU.  One is a geth turret.  This is not the friendly turret of the gethgineer.  It has an extremely high DPS rivaling a cerberus turret.  Cannot stun.  THe other is a geth drone.  A little floaty blue robot that looks like a standard engi's drone.  But this one fires a rocket that GOES AROUND CORNERS.  High priority (the prime, not the drone).  If you don't get stunned first by it and the three other units that can stun you.


**Conclusion**

There you have it.  The extremely broken geth faction.  Gone are the days of White/geth/gold.  No more over-cover grabs.  No more nice geth.  These are the days of the stagger-geth, the hunters will get you.  if you focus on the hunters, another will pop up, leaving you stunned for the pyros.  If you focus on the pyros, the bombers and primes get you.  If you focus on the primes...let's say all the other units will be stun-locking you into oblivion.

So remember - tech teams are the way to go.  Grenades with high forces (like multi-frags and cluster grenades) are helpful to stun the opposition.

1357938605.0,16eetd,"Frosty Burp-Gun Michael Caine, doo-dah, doo-dah [Human Infiltrator Build, oh the doo dah day]",yumpsuit,12, and you need a new toy. This build relies on what I believe to be the best assault rifle in the game: the ~~Cerberus Carrier~~ Scope and Stability Modded Hurricane. 

If you have despaired of ever getting your 100 SMG Medals achievement

[Build Link](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Human/FNMNF/Hurricane3AY5BC5/Scorpion10AI5AJ5/SMGRailAmp3/StabilizationModule3/GrenadeCapacity5/)

If you've specced him correctly he'll start to [look like this.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz3427cm4f1qzg4clo1_500.jpg)

This build has seen extensive action on Gold, handily outscoring both your humble narrator and a highly capable friend running a Turian Ghost with a Harrier X. In fact, I'd say that utterly wrecking Collectors is probably what this build does best, although you'll be demolishing the faces of every other faction too. Let's get right into the nitty-gritty.

-----------------------------------------

***POWERS***

**Tactical Cloak** goes to 4

**Sticky Grenades** can be spiced according to your taste. I went for straight damage since I've gotten comfortable using them that way, you've got gobs of straight damage flowing from the barrel of your gun all the time anyway, so feel free to mix in the other evolutions to your own preference if you find the grenades too fiddly. Maximal utility is never a bad way to go in ME3. 

The Hurricane doesn't have a huge damage per bullet


**Cryo Blast:** Our monster debuff and headshot setup -- staggers and chills mooks even if it doesn't freeze 'em. Duration is taken since the piffling Radius is only ever going to freeze two enemies, which is amazing against conga lines of mooks. No cryo detonation necessary!

**Alliance Training:** weppinz brah

**Fitness:** Taken to 4

-----------------------------------------------------------


***WEAPONRY***

*Hurricane. Yes, mister. She's not just your ULM/HVB anti-armor damage hose any more. She is sick and tired of sitting there unloved while you carouse around with your fancy shotguns and sleek Asari Acolytes until a big nasty Brute sends you crawling home to her with a bouquet of grocery-store roses. Can you open up your shuttered ape-like mind and let* ***her*** *be in control for once?!*

As you read earlier, but it's most at home here. However, once you learn to love it on the Human Infiltrator, I bet you'll want to experiment with the Scope/Stab Hurricane on some other classes too.

Secondaries are left to your personal preference and arsenal. The Scorpion is my secondary of choice because I love the Hurricane/Scorpion loadout the way Shredder loves hairless chimpanzees in space suits. Switching between a Pistol and SMG is super-fast, or when I hear a foe closing in, or to derail stomps, or for closing the door against pursuers, or when my sixth sense for shitty pubbies tells me that someone is about to do something brave and stupid. Lay down your mines, then switch to the Hurricane when it's maximum-dakka time. Worry about reloading once everything is dead -- 7 shots is a hell of a lot of Scorpion, boy-o. You can even be super cheesy and lay down some mines *before* you cloak

Do note that although the build link had High Caliber Barrel on it to show correct cooldowns

If my love letter to the Scorpion isn't your cup of tea, which will never cease to amuse me. 


--------------------------------------------------

***EQUIPMENT*** 

Highly modular

* Armor Piercing and Armor Weakening are two independent variables that feed into each other in some odd way that I'm sure will be clarified by the brain trust in the comments

* Cryo Ammo and Cryo Blast allegedly stack.

I tend to take AP regardless due to the massive damage boost and the fact that piercing cover is often handy if you freeze a foe in cover and they fall behind it. However

**Cheap and Cheerful**

Barrage Upgrade V and cruddy ammo like Warp II or Cryo III so that your Hurricane gets enough Armor Weakening from ammo and Cryo Blast that it nears its full damage output. and for christ's sake throw on that SMG Rail Amp I or Targeting VI I seriously when are you ever going to use those ok ready up gogogo

**Balls to the Wall**

AP IV, Grenade Capacity V

*Other Stuff I've Found Viable:*

Adrenaline Modules are great for the flow of gameplay and getting the most GTFO out of your 5.2 second Cloak. This is a build that wants to be dancing around in and out of cover at midrange

Shield Power Cells are good to ya since you want to be playing this build fast and loose

Targeting VI and his big multiplicative brother Vulnerability VI are also both great here.

Heck

----------------------------------------

So that's it! Thank you for reading -- I hope you will love this build as much as I do.

**Cloak**

With the buff there really is no reason not to take 6 points in cloak, not from cloak.

**Dark Channel**

Damage
Then Slow
Finally take the pierce evolution. Dark Channel is so bad against shields and health that an extra 40% damage won't change that. On the other hand

Dark Channel has a bit of a bad rep around here because of the way furies fuck over everyone else's biotic explosions.   
But with the huntress there is no need to spam dark channel

Against armor and barriers
For comparison

One cast of dark channel kills every enemy except banshees
For banshees

Some things worth noting about dark channel:

* If you cast DC while cloaked
* Is affected by warp's expose
* DC can jump to an unlimited amount of targets (swarmers...). Target has to be within 8m of the last target. 
* Eats through a phantom's barrier in like three seconds. 
* I played a game with a fury and I'm pretty sure the two dark channels stacked without issue. 
* DC is a bit wonky in that you can sometimes cast it around corners without line of sight

**Warp**

Typical specs; detonate
However the insane power damage bonus of the huntress adds another value to warp. It actually does pretty decent damage with this class (1500 against armor

You want to be spamming this with every cloak cycle

**Asari Huntress and Fitness**

This depends on how many points you need in fitness to play comfortably. Just do whatever is right for you there isn't really anything you can do wrong here. For me personally 5/3 is the right balance between damage and durability.

---

**Weapons**

Doesn't really matter. I usually take the harrier

The reegar is great too

I personally prefer warp ammo over incendiary with the huntress for three reasons. 

* It's really easy to get the bonus damage to lifted targets from warp with this class

* Incendiary ammo will prevent you from detonating dark channel and give you weak-ass fire combos instead of decent(ish) biotic explosions. 

* If you want to do the incendiary ammo + warp cheese

Depending on your team and enemy, the talon works too.

---

**Gameplay**

[VIDEO](http://youtu.be/1BxttyZIE1g)
---

It's so much easier to show gameplay that it is to describe
But the first 8 waves are probably the best gameplay I've recorded of myself (subtle brag) so I really don't want to throw that footage out because of one stupid mistake (I get swarmed by dragoons and just get staggered to death every time I pop medi-gel).

But despite the really frustrating ending

And as a side note, a banshee and unlimited dragoons (and centurions). It doesn't get much worse than that. At least there are no hunters.

Build for the solo was [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/AsariHuntress/PLQDJ/CerberusHarrier8BF5AD5/Acolyte10AJ5BA5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/ArmoredCompartments5/).    
Just a little more survivable than the build above

The acolyte is just for primes and atlases. In a normal game you shouldn't need it (except against geth).

---

**Notes/Tips/Loose Ends**

There are still a couple of things I want to mention that can't really be seen in the video. 

First of all, just spam warp to help the others out. 

If there are no other biotics
If you detonate dark channel

Then it's worth mentioning that the huntress is pretty goddamn awful against geth. All her powers are really bad against shields
If you know you are going up against geth

Collcetors are kind of the opposite

Cerberus is kind of the middle ground. The huntress is great against phantoms and dragoons but has problems with atlases and centurions. 

Against reapers

---

**About warp ammo**

It doesn't seem like this is very well known

This is why warp ammo is amazing with the huntress. She has two powers that both prime a target for a very long time.

So

Here is an example of what that means. Harrier VIII (HV barrel and mag upgrade)

     (124*0.6*2*2) = 297.6 ammo damage per shot 
     124*(1+0.05+0.3) = 167.4 weapon damage per shot
     for a total of 465

Against armor (or health

    (124*0.6*2) = 148.8 ammo damage per shot
    (124*(1+0.05+0.3))-50*(1-0.9)*(1-0.65) = 165.7 weapon damage per shot
     for a total of 314.5 

For comparison

against barriers:

    (124*0.6*2*(1+0.2))+(124*(1+0.2)*(1+0.075+0.05+0.075+0.1+0.3+0.8) = 535.65

against armor/health:

    (124*0.6*(1+0.2))+(124*(1+0.2)*(1+0.075+0.05+0.075+0.1+0.3+0.8)
    -50*(1-0.75)*(1-0.9)) = 445.15 

So against barriers the huntress does 86% of the ghost’s damage

*Of course this is only true as long as the target you are shooting at is actually primed.*

If we take the huntresses powers into account

Keep in mind though that the huntress has a glaring weakness against shields. Both warp and dark channel do half damage to shields and warp ammo doesn't work on them.  

---

**Final Words**

I hope you enjoyed my guide. And I also hope that some of you are gonna give her a whirl! 

I've played a lot of gold pugs since she was released

I also really wish that bioware will leave her like she is now. The cloak without weapon damage bonuses makes her a very unique character and I really hope they don't mess with that.

In case you haven't played it, where you fight through maps just like a Halo campaign mission, but with a team size of 1-4. Want to go in solo? do it. want to team up with a friend or a random person? go ahead. 

Another epic part of these missions is that these combine the Co-op scoring from Firefight and Matchmaking (get medals and more kills for more points), but its still FUN. You move from placement to placement, position to position, fighting through enemies to reach a goal, then you extract back the way you came (usually). Plus the fact you get FemShep (Jennifer Hale) telling you what to do makes it all that much more fun. Oh, and I also forgot to mention... its FREE! High quality voice acting and co-op missions for free. AWESOME!

I'm also very

Back to ME3's Multiplayer... its just a Hoard/Firefight mode. Fun, and these are cool for a few times. But in the end, its still just the same old ME3 multiplayer. Its good fun for wasting a bit of time, but ultimately is nothing special. 

Granted

I wish Bioware would have been able to implement such a remarkable gameplay mode with their Multiplayer from the start, I would love it to be free, but if the cost is low and the quality is high, I'd be all for paying for it.

Hopefully Bioware takes notes by watching and playing Halo 4 and can learn from Spartan Ops. I would hate for the last note of ME3's MP to be ""it was boring."" Bioware has the power to bring it back in force

tl;dr - Halo 4 has Spartan Ops. Bioware needs to implement a similar system in ME3 MP before we all get too bored with it and leave ME3 on the shelf for good.

While I am hiding from Cleetus (formerly Curtis the Imaginary Critic)

The plan of using this character is simple: take out the critical targets. Typically, Phantoms, Pyros, Hunters, Marauders, etc). While there are times to focus on the boss enemies when they threaten the team, note that killing bosses just makes bosses spawn again until the budget is depleted and inefficient at finishing the wave in a quick manner. 

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#40PAPNRd1c9@A@@Q4P4V4U4) is the build that I use that is quite useful on a variety of difficulties and against all three enemies.

The reason I put zero points into Cryo Blast is that the travel time of the projectile is generally incompatible with sniping and without it, I would greatly appreciate it. Plus, Sticky Grenades can get me out of a problem situation fast and can segment enemies away from each other, much like with a [Shotgun Infiltrator](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/y8gzg/the_cryo_claymore_commando_human_infiltrator/).

Now then

**Sidearms** - For people who are confident in sniping at any range (not me), Carnifex, Phalanx, Tempest, Hurricane, you name it. I would recommend those as they are good at a variety of ranges and they are relatively lightweight. Most of the time these sidearms will be useful moving from cover to cover and finishing off weakened enemies at the end of the wave.

**Sniper Rifle**- While there are a huge amount of sniper rifles

*Sniper Rifle*- Advantage, Disadvantage, etc. (short comment)

While on Bronze and Silver shield gating is hardly noticeable on single shot snipers

*Black Widow*- High damage/shot, weighty, slow ROF compared to other snipers, low clip capacity (My personal favorite sniper rifle as it can effectively deal with armor)

*Valiant*- Good damage/shot, decent ROF | Only available as an N7 Ultra Rare as a reward for weekend events (This does a better job against non-armored targets compared to the Black Widow, while the Black Widow does a better job against armored targets)

*Viper*- Uncommon, good ROF | On the lower end of damage/shot, only gets two shots in cloak (This is a good sniper rifle for the beginner sniper but as better sniper rifles become accessible, its power diminishes relative to others)

*Krysae*- High damage/shot especially vs armor, has 2 zoom levels | Low space ammo count, slow RoF, awkward to handle, projectile can lag, proximity fuse is difficult to accustom to (Despite the nerfs to it, it is still a decent weapon that now requires some dexterity to operate)

*Harpoon Gun*- Excellent damage/shot, can be fired when cloaked, can pierce armor plating on Guardians and Cannibals, fast reload speed | Suffers from projectile lag, cannot charge when cloaked, only one shot per cloak cycle, low powered scope (Unless you understand this weapon well

*Indra*- Excellent RoF, fast reload speed, lightweight | Ultra Rare, burns through ammo quickly, is less effective against armor, low powered scope, may have recoil issues, but it is pretty damn good overall)

**Ammo**- Ammo consumables enhance the lethality of a sniper rifle by a large margin. Personally, but effective if you are unsure what enemy type you will be facing. The second is Cryo Ammo, which with the help of the Tactical Cloak damage bonus will freeze any target you shoot at. Very good if you are not a good shot and want an easy follow up shot (like me). Finally, Disruptor Ammo is useful if you want to strip shields effectively and set up for Tech Bursts.

[**THE BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Human/OARNR/Lancer10AC5AD5//AssaultRifleRailAmp3//WarfighterPackage5/)

It's not the best gun or the most overpowered class or anything, or at least as close as you can get to it anyway. No more dubious thermal clip retcons as an excuse for EA to implement a conventional ammo system to make the game more familiar and easier to design. We're back in the future again.

**THE GUN**

I didn't actually know anything about the Lancer before I got a chance to use it. All I knew was that it was an ultra-rare Avenger reskin, at the very least since trying a melee slayer build.

Of course there were some significant downsides to the gun as well and I was determined to optimize it to make it as good as possible. Issue number one is the extremely low stability. Unless it's being fired from cover, stability and muzzle climb is the real problem-causer), and you'll be able to be getting consistent, sustained, headshot damage even at long range. Firing from cover with SD V will make it feel like a geth pulse rifle in terms of stability and accuracy.

Issue number two is that the flat damage the weapon does is somewhat mediocre on its own if you want it to be your primary damage source. Naturally the solution to this is using it on a class with a damage-boosting power. I originally was using it on human infiltrator in conjunction with cryo blast, obviously), then let it recharge during the short cooldown. IMO human soldier is the optimal class for getting the most out of the gun damage-wise. On infiltrators you won't quite be able to mow down those armored enemies or systematically take out an entire large group of soldiers in the ~3-second cloak bonus window, and then your damage gets reduced and it takes longer to finish them from there. With more than double the time to have access to the damage bonus, you'll end up being able to kill more things faster with no damage falloff. This is a great gun to use assault rifle amps on as well to get even more bang for your buck. If you have fewer assault rifle amps than you do fingers like most people that play this game and want to save them for plat, don't worry though; targeting VI III is a really great substitute. As long as you're aiming at the head you'll get almost the exact same effect as you would with AR amp III, and getting headshots with this and other full-auto weapons is generally a lot easier than having to line up and time single-shot weapons repeatedly. You won't be able to get the benefit vs. ravagers and atlases

Third is the issue inherent to most assault rifles: low damage per shot means armor piercing is a necessity. Since both stability damper and mag upgrade are non-negotiable if you want to get the most out of the Lancer

**THE SOLDIER**

So now your gun is optimized and ready for battle. Give it a girl's name if that's your thing. I don't care. I didn't. Fuck it

1. Take your gun

2. Pop America Rush

3. Shoot everything in the face for 6.8 seconds

4. Chill in cover while your ammo comes back

5. Repeat

Not the most intellectually-demanding strategy, when to use soft cover, and when to switch between them. Yes, unlike many of the most popular classes, there is a benefit to actually using the cover system the way the series originally intended with this guy. And of course, cover was a huge part of Mass Effect 1 as well so we get to get a little nostalgia rush while taking advantage of the other benefits.

The main use cover has is that it provides a stability and accuracy bonus. While the natural stability and accuracy ratings your Lancer has are good enough for this not to be required at midrange or closer, albeit at reduced damage. Sometimes at long enough range though, enemies won't even return fire at you. Also, this gun doesn't have a ramp-up bonus, so there's no reason you can't briefly duck back in cover for a split second to dodge an incoming projectile then pop back out and resume shooting.

When dealing with enemies at close to midrange, your accuracy is good enough that most or all of your bullets will hit where you're aiming and stability is almost a nonissue with your mod setup. Remember to **always zoom when aiming** as it will significantly increase your accuracy and by extension your headshot damage. The only time you should fire unzoomed is if you've got a dragoon/pyro/bomber right in your face at point-blank. At that range hipfiring is easier to adjust for their erratic movement and they'll be close enough that most of the shots will land even without zooming.

It's kind of a strange dynamic because overall the cover system works the opposite way from how it should; in general when using this gun, take advantage of this.

To quickly touch on the recharge mechanic of the gun, skip the overheat animation and immediately begin the recharge should you accidentally burn down your clip all the way and overheat it. The best strategy is to only fire the gun while A-rush is active (or for a little longer if you just need a little more damage to finish off that last enemy), then hop into the nearest cover for a few seconds to safely let it recharge to full during the cooldown. The recharge tends to last a little bit longer than the power cooldown (which is extremely short if you only bring a Lancer), so I recommend waiting the extra half-second or so to get completely filled up, *then* pop out and activate again.

&gt;
&gt;The Adas does double damage against shields which already gives this weapon a good use, I have to say the Acolyte does its job better than anything else. However this weapon does not try to replace the Acolyte, because this is not only what the weapon is for, it is merely a bonus. Along with 2x bonus, it ignores the shieldgate which is nice for its slow RoF. It also has a very nice magazine size, and since you don't need AP ammo on it (projectile weapon), the magazine upgrade is very viable and gives you a great magazine that you can kill a lot of enemies with without reloading.
&gt;
&gt;The Adas is really friggin' accurate. It has no recoil, you can even stagger some boss enemies with it.
&gt;
&gt;Now we're getting to the part where the Adas really excels; applying ammo powers. It will apply the ammo power to every single shot you fire. Using cryo ammo on this weapon is actually really awesome. You can freeze 1 enemy with 1 shot, then the rest. A weapon that can make use of cryo ammo is already good in my books. But it doesn't stop there. If you put Incediary ammo on this weapon and you have a detonator, for example proxy mine, you will have fire explosion everywhere.
&gt;
&gt;There is one part about the Adas I do not like
&gt;
&gt;The Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle is this weeks weapon of the week, but using it feels awesome. If you say that the Adas isn't awesome, take a look at [Quarksman the Geth Slayer](http://i.imgur.com/R5iYRJo.jpg) and try to tell me that it isn't awesome. It may not kill everything in half a second like the Piranha or lolreegar, but it isn't a bad weapon, it does good damage if you play it right, and IMO it's more fun to use this weapon than the formerly stated weapons.

(Max regen for tankiness and power damage for . . . y'know . . . more power damage.)

*FIRE!!!* (Flamer)

*Fire main way to kill things.  Fire make enemy stop because he's on fire.  Easy to kill him while he panics.*

*Most teammates not know how to use fire best.  They just keep spraying it all the time.  If they use little bit of fire at a time

(If you just pulse Flamer

*LAUNCH FIRE!!!* (Carnage)

*Sometimes enemy too far away for Fire.  This power good for shooting at far away enemy.*

*Launch Fire also makes burning enemy explode.  Very good for building up YAAAGH!*

(Carnage is your detonator power for Fire explosions.  True, but nothing too dramatic.  Fire Explosions have decent AoE, which makes for good crowd control and they have a small DoT effect which keeps shields and barriers from regenerating.)

(Another tip is to launch an Acolyte bolt and immediately follow it up with a Carnage shot.  The Acolyte strips shields so the Carnage does some damage and it also momentarily stuns your target so they won't flip or roll out of the way.  If you bring Disruptor Ammo and time your shots well

**WEAPONS &amp; EQUIPMENT**

*GUN!!!*

*Acolyte is good weapon for me.  It may look like Asari sex toy

I told him he could do this writeup as long as he behaved himself

Anywhoo

If you use the Heavy Barrel

Use Disruptor or Phasic seems like overkill at that point

The Power Magnifier is a must in the second mod slot.  Who doesn't like a burnier Flamer?

A nice thing about the Acolyte is that you can hold your charged shot and fire it off in the middle of a Flamer burst.  This comes in very handy if you are Flamering an enemy and suddenly a Phantom pops around a corner and gets in your face.  Your Flamethrower won't get her Barrier down before she wrecks your face and possibly impales you

The build specifies a CSMG

If you want to skip the SMG and just bring the Acolyte (or find yourself face-to-face with a Guardian and don't have time to swap weapons)

**Notes**

Like any other Vorcha build

I *have* playtested this build on a Plat solo and it is **solid**.  It can handle the enemies well when there's no one else around to get the kills.

The Regen and large health pool make this build somewhat tanky, Primes, Scions, Ravagers, and Praetorians *will* chew you up.  Your main counter to this is the great Vorcha dodge.

Use it often.

You have to stay ""deep in the red"" (2 - 3 stacks of Bloodlust) to keep your Regen at a high rate.  Watch out if you get downed and have to wait awhile for a teammate to rez you or after doing objectives

Also

You have a somewhat long grab kill animation.  You are also invulnerable for the duration of the animation, 3) kill an enemy and f) notch another elusive Grab Kill for grinding trophies.

Not the best build to use against Collectors.  If those damn bees get you

1357704903.0,1689ud,Tech Dream Team (Team Build),spark2,37,6,20,"So I saw RepShred's 2-person build today and I thought, with as much synergy between them as I could cram in. Here goes nothing.

**THE TEAM**

*The Primers*

* **Vorcha Sentinel**: Flamer is, this is where it's at. The cooldown is about one second long if you pulse it, and it blankets a gigantic area. The Vorcha Sentinel is the best class that has Flamer for this team, as it also has one of the best detonators in the game: Cluster Grenades. This means that if someone goes down, the Vorcha is the best candidate for going without a partner, as he can prime and detonate his own combos very fast and very effectively. His one weakness is that he is reliant on having access to an ammo box to resupply, but pairing him with someone who can detonate for him negates this. Spec him 5/6/6/5/4, but a couple of evos are necessary. First, it's up to you.

* **N7 Paladin**: You know it had to be here. No tech dream team is complete without this great Destroyer of Eardrums. He is the second primer on the team, but be sure to have 6 points in snap freeze, with reach for 4 and damage/weakness for 6, since the explosion evo is bugged.


*The Detonators*

* **Geth Engineer**: Again, for reasons I'll explain in the strategy section.

* **N7 Slayer**: Some of you are asking ""I thought this was supposed to be a tech team."" The rest of you are thinking ""Of course."" Phase Disruptor is, and can be replenished with a charge. Anyone who has ever played a game with a Slayer on a tech team will tell you of the wonders of PD. Take Radius, Efficient Blast, and Shield damage on PD, and Barrier on Charge. Go full Defense for Fitness, and Power damage on the offensive passives.


**THE PAIRINGS**

You'll want to put the Slayer with the Vorcha

First of all, it can sit in the back spamming Chain Overload while the extremely tanky Paladin takes the brunt of the punishment. In addition, Snap Freeze affects a maximum of 3 targets at a time, which is also the number of targets hit by Chain Overload. Overload also means that enemy shields get stripped very quickly, opening them up for maximum damage from Cryo Explosions. The last awesome thing that Overload does is stun organic enemies, taking some heat off of the Paladin so he can do some more chilling. Furthermore, Hunter Mode lets the Geth let the Paladin know where the enemies are through walls so he can Snap Freeze them (voice chat is your friend). The icing on the cake, is the Geth Turret

Now, and they can both take it. They both have fantastic dodges, and the shield stripping ability of PD lets the Fire Explosions from Flamer truly shine. The main problem with this pairing is that they are going to have no shields for most of the game. PD drains barriers on use, and Vorchas have shields made of paper. However, if the Gethgineer can keep a turret near you two, this problem is mitigated. Since the Slayer can recharge by charging (which also detonates another explosion), the Vorcha should get the brunt of this benefit, making you exponentially more survivable. The turret also gives you some situational awareness by letting you know where enemies are.


**NOTES/STRATEGY**

* **Vorcha**: What you want to do is pulse Flamer. This means turn it on for about 3-4 seconds (enough time for the Slayer to detonate and for you to lay some stacks on), turn it off, over and over again. Each ""cast"" of Flamer can only prime an enemy once, so leaving it on for the maximum duration doesn't add as much damage as pulsing does. The good thing for you is that you will get fuckloads of kills with your fire explosions and Flamer DOT, so Bloodlust should almost constantly be charged, meaning that your health will race up. Other than that, just remember to aim at the ground a bit in front of a group of enemies when throwing cluster grenades for the best coverage. Have fun orgasming over kills.

* **Paladin**: You're going to want to be as tanky as possible, your basic combo is Snap Freeze, then either duck into cover until the Gethgineer has detonated, or make your own damn cover, because you're a Paladin and don't give a shit. Only Incinerate (if you even spec into it) when the guy is already frozen/chilled, and only if you can't drain anyone. Also remember that even if you don't see the armor effect from ED (if you're off host), it's still on. Protecting the Gethgineer is your job, reviving him is your priority. Snap Freeze anyone around him to clear the crowd a bit, remember that Snap Freeze can detonate explosions too. This means that if you can get the guy that the Gethgineer started the chain at in the blast

* **Gethgineer**: Just keep Overloading, but that doesn't mean the easiest. You're extremely fragile, so stay in cover, and move like hell if you get ambushed. Also, stay in communication with the Paladin, and let him know when enemies are inbound on his position. You'll do well to take a light sniper rifle like the Indra, since you're far enough away from the action that the explosions won't mess you up

* **Slayer**: You're the least tanky of the frontline squad, less if you're taking fire. Each PD will only detonate one explosion, no matter how many primed enemies you hit, so don't be afraid to hit the same area multiple times. Also, remember that the ground is easier to hit than enemies-- aim at their feet. As fwooooooomp pointed out, the Scorpion is great on him, as staggers are your friend and will keep you both alive. Take ammo and ULM.

Test data can be found in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHZjbO-LxlyX7DBLuVP0dztRN2IayJVpdo-M-1fLiFE/edit) google doc.

Topic on BSN can be found here: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15123388

&gt;Summary

&gt;* The volus HM is hereafter known as a shell.
- The shell can be cancelled early by pressing the melee button.
- When the shell detonates
- If the shell is cancelled early
- You are not able to deploy the shell while cloaked (light melee).
- The **approximate** duration of invulnerability for the shell is 0.9-1 seconds upon deployment. Sustaining the shell will not grant further invulnerability even upon new triggers.
- As long as the shell is sustained
- Each trigger of the shell will regenerate 10% of the volus's max shields.
- Shield boost grants invulnerability for **approximately** 1.5s upon casting.
- The shell inflicts 100% (no bonus) damage to all defences except armour
- The DR provided by the shell and shield boost can be stacked. This includes external sources and can actually stack beyond the listed 90% in the shield boost

First off, I didn't see it when I checked the backlog.

Okay

The idea of this class is to emulate the bastard Geth Primes with their stunlock railguns. Everything is geared towards keeping those pesky Hunters and Phantoms stunned while you whittle away at their health.

Weapons loadout is Falcon (Extended Mags and Barrel) and GPS (Spare Ammo and Barrel). Yes I know, with Cryo Ammo, while GPS is for when you need to take out big boss mobs. Both weapons stun your basic enemies which allows you to fire off a Concussive Shot and floor them, or shatter them if they're frozen. And all the while they're too busy getting stunned to fight back. It's relatively slow, but very safe, for taking out enemies, especially Phantoms. Basic strategy is to pop in and out of cover with Falcon shots at the ground and when their protection drops, which is why the AoE CC from those mini-grenades is so important as a backup. And of course

Basic build is 6-5-6-6-3. Used to be 6-5-3-6-6 but I respecced because of how juicy Frags are

**Adrenaline Rush** - Hardening

This is basically your panic button when you need a free refill of your shields. Not much more to say

**Concussive Shot** - Radius

I question the usefulness of both the Level 6 evolutions so I don't bother going past 5. That really gives you all you need. It's also why Cryo Ammo is the best choice to always roll this class with. Obviously, so take the Impact Radius evolution instead. And cooldown's already short enough even with the weapon loadout so you don't need to take that. Concussive Shot is your ace in the hole, it gives you a third option for stunning enemies and allows you to deal with the mooks you froze with your Falcon really quickly. I believe with an Assault Rifle Rail Amp III it takes just two Falcon shots and then a Concussive Shot to kill your standard trooper unit, and all the while they won't be able to hit you back.

**Frag Grenade**

I'd say go all the way, honestly since shields are usually less strong than armor, I don't see the point of speccing into that. Plus, this makes your Frags more useful against Reapers (God forbid if you actually play this class against Gold Reapers).

**Alliance Training** - Damage and Capacity

Since your weapons are heavy as fuck, and I honestly always aim for the feet with the Falcon so I don't take advantage of that bonus. Best to give more power to your powers.

**Fitness**

You could arguably skip Fitness altogether and I wouldn't blame you for it. But since some of the other power evolutions are so worthless, who is very bad at staying in cover and hanging back. Call of Duty has ruined my playstyle, I'm just too aggressive for my own good.

So this is the Drell Assassin headshot build. No character can come close to the headshot damage this character can produce. The reason why

* Drell Passives
* Tactical Cloak
* M-11 Suppressor 

Now the build we'll be using is a 4/4/6/6/6 utilizing all weapon aspects of the Drell Passives. Now what makes the Drell passives so good? Extra headshot damage

**Weapons** The guns we'll be using are the M-11 Suppressor and the M-12 Locust. 

**M-11 Suppressor** This gun has the highest headshot multiplier out of all the guns in the game making it the perfect headshot machine. It also has a decent clip size

**M-12 Locust** To counter-act the low ammo supplies of the Suppressor

**Powers** Running a 4/4/6/6/6 build is what I personally like to run. It adds extra movement speed from fitness

**Tactical Cloak** I like to leave tactical cloak at 4 points

**Homing Grenades** I like to take 4 points into homing grenades just so if I run out of ammo on my Suppressor

**Recon Mine** This is your debuffer so you can knock out enemies even faster. Go for radius Rank 4 so more enemies are effected. Rank 5 go for damage since you'll be firing this from cloak and recharge speed would not affect the outcome. And finally go for invasive scan to make recon mine a debuffer.

**Drell Assassin** All weapon damage! Especially headshots since it's an extra 30%.

**Fitness** All shields. Pretty basic we won't be doing any melee unless its a last resort and that extra movement speed is great for getting from spawn to spawn.

**Equipment** Most of equipment is personal preference and what you have at what level. **Ammo type**, headshots, headshots. **Passive Amp** This one really does not matter. You could use Cyclonic but Drell barriers suck. Shield Power Cells, it's alright. Adrenaline Mod, I personally prefer this just to make objects easier as an objective. But again, it's up to personal preference. **Gear** I only recommend two things, Vulnerability VI or Pistol Amp. We're focusing on the Suppressor and these are the two aspects the gun is good at

1365547508.0,1c0ta0,Way of the Novaguard,Kallously,33,3,30,"**Introduction**

The novaguard is a high risk, AoE damage, and detonating power combos. The gameplay is extremely fast paced and very fun when done right.

Before continuing

Lastly

**The Build**

[Half-Blast Nova](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/Human/RAMPR/Talon4BK5AH5/Hurricane8AU5BB5/PistolRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/StrongholdPackage5/)

There are definitely other ways of playing the novaguard

* It has the highest throughput for combo detonations in the game. Period.

* The use of half-blast nova with good cooldowns is very forgiving. With the claymore nova build

* I find the super high pace to be extremely fun and rewarding. Since you have so much more leeway with so many low CD invulnerability frames

None of the abilities or evolutions are really that debatable.

**Weapons and Equipment**

The Talon is best possible choice. Its got high burst, a Carnifex, Paladin, Executioner, Hornet, Piranha, or Scorpion are possible candidates

Having a high level Hurricane with the AP mod and ULM is also a great way to cover some of the novaguard's weakness. For hack circles and dangerous bosses

The power mods for weapons are decent choices if the player is looking for a little more AoE damage at a cost of single target DPS. Overall, the 20% reduction in weight in Alliance training is a good option.

Disruptor rounds are recommended for solo runs and teams that have a limited ability to set up combos (so you don't overlap the better combos) since they have a larger AoE, use either AP or warp ammo and replace the AP gun mods with damage or capacity ones.

Cyclonic is a straightforward choice since the novaguard is in close quarters so often. Stronghold package is great for gear since the reduced shield recharge time is good for getting back shields without charging and the extra shields are never a bad thing. The commando package is also a good choice if you're looking for more damage


**Techniques**

*Nova Canceling*

Nova canceling is one of the core components to effective novaguard play. On cast, resulting in no damage dealt or barriers consumed, but still granting the full 1.5s of immunity.

The side roll is the best choice for canceling nova as it is fast and allows for a good displacement. Forward dodges aren't as great as they're slower

While nova canceling is incredibly potent, the player is unable to kill or CC enemies in an area after a charge/nova combo, or there is incoming damage like an Atlas rocket.

*Firing between Powers*

This is a very useful technique that can contribute a significant amount to the novaguard's DPS. If a player holds down the trigger after activating an ability, it can lead to rapidly chained combos with devastating effects.

*Reload Animation Hiding*

This technique refers to reloading a weapon during the animation of an ability, immediately use charge or nova and take no other action other than walking/running until the run has finished reloading (eg. nova canceling doesn't work).

*Moving During and After Powers*

This is more of a minor point, CC, or slight repositioning for better nova placements. As for biotic charge, a player can hold down a direction so that they immediately move after completing the charge. For dangerous enemies that can stagger you like Primes, this is a useful tip for moving/rolling away immediately.

**Sync Kills**

These are the bane of novaguards considering they have to put themselves in melee range constantly. The key thing is knowing when an enemy can sync kill or not and setting rules for when it is safe. In general

Banshees and Praetorians aren't safe to approach in general unless they're in the middle of their casting mode (warp/heavy melee for banshees

Ramps and inclines are the great equalizer against sync killing enemies. However

**Staggers**

*Staggers by enemies*

Getting staggered is the next worst thing to being sync killed as it means you become vulnerable to all sorts of things

Occasionally, leaving you with no charge or nova to survive. One of the most common enemies this can happen with is the Atlas when it fires its heavy rocket. Be sure to either stagger the atlas before it gets the shot off, avoid the missile before charging, or nova cancel tank it in place.

*Staggering against enemies*

During certain animations

**Gameplay**

**You must host the match when playing a novaguard if you want to play properly.**  There are absolutely no exceptions to this rule. Luckily

The core gameplay isn't too complicated. The standard combo is charge-&gt;shoot-&gt;nova-&gt;shoot-&gt;nova and repeat. Use nova canceling whenever you get into a situation that you aren't sure you'll survive; with experience, **A**lways **B**e **C**harging. Novaguards rely on constant movement to stay alive and deal damage. Regular rolls are also effective when nova is down.

Novaguards are best suited for taking out and drawing the attention of the regular mooks and letting their harder hitting team mates deal with bosses. Novaguards can engage up to groups four or five non-basic units effectively

When there's the presence of combo priming abilities, and Collector adepts are some of the best partners for the novaguard for the sheer throughput on explosions.

Novaguards are great on all difficulties except for platinum

**Factions**

*Cerberus* 

Consisting mostly of CCable humanoid targets

*Geth*

This is another great faction for novaguards due to the large number of humanoid targets. The key thing here is to stagger enemies before they can stagger you. Be careful when engaging primes as their melee will stagger you after a charge and their turrets can chain stun you to death. Engage enemies in more manageable groups and the geth are easy as they possess no sync kills.

*Reapers*

The Reapers are a step up from the previous two factions since there's a greater number of high resilience targets that are difficult to CC, and banshees. Brutes are a huge pain to deal with as any of their moves will stagger and they can sync kill. Banshees are the more obvious threat so it is important to only ever charge a banshee when she is casting heavy melee or warp.

*Collectors*

The hardest faction for novaguards. The collectors also have two tanky units to be dealt with like the Reapers. Praetorians should almost never be approached unless they are casting and scions are annoyingly beefy. Above all this

**Soloing**

Novaguards are competent soloists. There are a few key things to keep in mind:

* Try to only engage groups that you can CC or kill
* When in doubt
* Leave bosses for last unless lots of enemies are grouped around them. Setting off tech bursts around bosses is a good tactic
* Be extra cautious of staggers and synch kills. Learn the tells for these moves well.
* When doing the hack objective
* For the pizza delivery

Novaguards have an easy time soloing the first 3 waves of every faction up to gold so don't be afraid to start empty lobbies; other people usually join within these first few waves. At waves 6+, but it's entirely doable.

One of the nice things about soloing is there is a lot more control of the variables on the battlefield. Numbers of enemies can be better accounted for and there are no allies to prime an enemy's synch kill or bubble of denial.

**Video Demonstrations**

Novaguards are a difficult class to learn from just reading so I've included of my personal solos.

[FBWGG - 35:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWixKV-GGqE)

[FBGCG - 36:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siT6KkRlYSg)

There are a lot of sloppy points in these videos, the more difficult parts about novaguard are learning the small mechanical nuances. For team play, it's simply getting into the mindset that you need to support your team and the gameplay should naturally follow with practice. 

I highly recommend [achire2k's solos](http://www.youtube.com/user/Achire2k?feature=watch). Watching his videos was what pushed me into the next level of novaguard play and he's got many of the mechanics extremely refined. Also has a pretty nice set of music tracks.

**Conclusion**

The vanguards of a military force are those who are on the leading edge, detonating combo explosions, and just simply being badass.

See you on the battlefield

Operation Aegis:

This is General Corinthus to all troops deployed in the Trebia System. 

Men, are holding out, but aren't making strong headway against the Reapers. Our reinforcements are sparse, while the enemy is only getting stronger. 

Recently, but if that base falls, the defense of Menae is broken, and the moon is good as gone. And if Menae falls, the troops on Palaven lose even more support. To make matters worse, our Havoc, Ghost and Saboteur units are spread thin across the galaxy

Thankfully, I was recently contacted by a volus named Barla Von. Seems our little friends have been busy. Von has a organized a small battalion of volus troops, and managed to slip them right under the Reapers's noses on to Menae. They've already started digging in at Condor. They aren't the toughest in a firefight, but they're damn good support units. Needless to say, they can't do it without your help. So, I humbly command all turian forces in the immediate system to fall back to Menae. Our actions in this war will decide the fate of the turian people. Lets give the historians something good to write about.

I'll assume you've read the in-game descriptions of the powers and already know roughly what they all do.

If you're intending to use these powers to set off combos with ammo

##Adrenaline Rush

Like marksman, activating A-rush and firing again instantly. 

If you want to break a banshee sync kill and you have a heavy damage single-shot weapon like the claymore or javelin, firing again and using adrenaline rush and firing a third time lets you take three shots within the space of about a second - two with a 100% bonus and one with 170%.

Some people using this build report success not taking evolution 3 (""Duration"") and say that it allows them to instantly reload more frequently because the benefit of activating adrenaline rush (instant reloads) occurs more often.

Unlike tactical cloak

For the hardening evolution

Evolution 5 (""Shield Boost"") restores 100% of your *base shields* (so 500 points of shielding). If you invest fully in the fitness tree

##Ballistic Blades

The mechanics of this power are still a little bit of a mystery, so be warned.

The power shoots out a number of projectiles in a 90 degree cone

Each of these projectiles causes some amount of damage (possibly a fraction of the ballistic blades' 900+bonuses damage). More than one projectile can lodge into a target - we have a figure for maxprojectilesstuck in the settings file (set to three) and we can assume that the projectiles spread out from the batarian

The projectiles cause some proportion of their damage immediately and the remainder as damage over time. My Batso has blades that cause 1417.5 damage, or 15 seconds with evolution 5.

The impact of ballistic blades applies 800N of force

The explosion is an evolution much loved by skilled players. It applies 800N of force a second time

Much of the BSN believes that in rank 4 and 5, and that the power therefore does less damage, and that reach is a way of ensuring your power does more damage at longer ranges.

##Carnage

The power applies 300N of force and will affect a maximum of 2 targets

The incapacitate evolution ragdolls a maximum of one target. The rank 6 armor damage evolution multiplies *total damage*.

##Concussive Shot

The power applies 300N of force and will ragdoll a maximum of one target. The power does quadruple damage to barriers

The shredder evolution (evolution 6) does 200% of *total damage* to organic targets (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13855086/11#14968579). The DoT stacks. The shatter evolution (evolution 3) on frozen targets doubles base damage and doubles shredder's damage as well.

##Havoc Strike

Like submission net and cryo blast, which refills your shields). However unlike biotic charge, havoc strike now allows you to choose the radius option (in rank 6 of strike and rank 4 of charge) and weapon damage bonuses in your passive, and still breach the 1000N threshhold necessary to staggar a gold or platinum phantom.

Strike gives you invulnerability frames. Although these don't protect against sync kills

Havoc strike kills do give you tech medals. I'm still covering it here though

Like charge

With the area bonus in rank 6

There's an interesting bug/exploit related to havoc strike allowing you to perform it without triggering a cooldown - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14645008. Use it at your own risk.

 **Racial Passives and Traits**

Several of the N7 classes have Fitness and Passives perks that are unique to that particular character. The N7 Paladin Sentinel has Shield Mastery instead of fitness, gains a level 6 combo primer. The Shadow Infiltrator learns Sword Mastery, which makes her melee attack do devastatingly high amounts of damage, and while most classes can take power damage increases, the Demolisher Engineer's passive traits increase grenade capacity. All the rest are standard Fitness/Passive trees. 

In terms of traits, the Fury Adept and Slayer both have a unique teleport dodge that can actually allow you to jump through walls, which greatly helps evade or surprise enemies. The Demolisher and Paladin can do a standard combat role, the Devastator Soldier can do a sidestep (unless the Devastator has one of his powers activated, more on that later), and the Shadow can do an acrobatic dodge like the Drell

----

**N7 Destroyer Soldier**

This guy is pretty much a mech trooper. His TV-5 Battlesuit provides him with outrageous shield ([up to 3850 when specced right](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/?mobile#Soldier/NDestroyer/KAAAR////CyclonicModulator4/ShieldBooster5/)) and weapon damage bonuses, with his *Multi-Frag Grenades* able to clear out enemy clusters with ease. 

* Devastator Mode is the Devastator's signature power, rate of fire, shields, shield recharge, fire rate and magazine size. When the damage options are all chosen in this and his Passives, he receives a +50% weapon damage bonus. The only downside is it slows movement speed and prevents combat dodging. It is a sustained power, meaning that it stays on until you turn it off. 

* the Hawk Missile Launcher is his second sustained power. When combined with Devastator Mode

* Multi-Frag Grenades are different than usual grenades. Rather than throwing a grenade like everyone else
Damage and force is chosen for every option, as 5 grenades thrown at once makes taking out clustered groups of enemies a breeze. 

**N7 Fury Adept**

Nimble, *devastatingly* powerful. There's a reason she's known as a Biotic Explosion machine. Her 3 powers, *Annihilation Field, Dark Channel* and *Throw* combine together to bring about countless explosions all over the battlefield. 

* Annihilation Field is an extended-duration power that surrounds the Fury with biotic energy, potentially draining their health to replenish your shields, and if used again while still active, sends out a powerful biotic wave that will detonate BEs. 

* Dark Channel is a DoT power that primes targets for BEs, and DC jumps to a nearby target, priming that one. Kill that one, it jumps again. This makes clearing out groups very easy. 

* Throw is your standard biotic power. With a powerful BE boost evolution at level 5 and a very fast recharge time

**N7 Shadow Infiltrator**

Another nimble warrior, you can be in and out of enemy groups before they know what hit them, before you fall back onto your crowd control power, *Electric Slash*. 

* Tactical Cloak is the power common to all Infiltrators that grants invisibility for a short time (so they can infiltrate. Get it?)

* Electric Slash is a directional wave of electricity for taking out multiple enemies at once. It's a powerful attack that can go through walls and detonate Tech Combos; when combined with a Snap Freeze-happy Paladin

* Shadow Strike is, you teleport behind an enemy to slice through them with your sword. Because of this, it's counted as a melee attack, which is why it's so powerful; it benefits from both SS's evolutions *and* Sword Mastery, the Shadow's version of fitness. When melee damage is maxed on everything, the base damage for SS is 1,890 damage. When gear is applied and you use the power while cloaked,000 damage.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/?mobile#Infiltrator/NShadow/JAKIK/ATRaider1BG5AA1//StrengthEnhancer3//HydraulicJoints5/)

**N7 Paladin Sentinel**

I hope you like the sound of breaking glass. The Paladin is the combo-lover's wet dream come true. He carries three offensive powers, all of which prime for tech combos, and all of which detonate tech combos. His signature Omni-Shield can also be deployed for momentary cover, and used to shield bash. 

* Snap Freeze is a blast of super-cooled air that, slows and debuffs shielded/armoured enemies and primes for Cryo Explosions. Due to a bug, all CEs primed by SF do 2x as much damage as they should. They also have a decent blast radius, so if you've frozen a target and then set off the CE with another target nearby, that target will also cop the explosion. Snap Freeze can also penetrate walls, so a decent idea is to use it every time you go around a corner. If you see an ice cube lying on the floor, a quick dose of Incinerate will clear that mess right up. Note: the level 6 evolution, is bugged and doesn't work. Take Damage &amp; weakness instead. 

* Incinerate launches a flaming projectile that set enemies on fire and detonated most TCs. Powerful against armour

* Shield Drain is an instantaneous-effect attack that drains shields and damages synthetics to restore your own shields. Against most factions, and armoured targets are immune. Neither will recharge your shields. Against the Geth however, you're practically unstoppable. Every single enemy can be drained for shield recharge. It works much better if Incinerate or SF is used first, as not only will you get a shield boost, but you'll also get the TE. 

* Omni-Shield is the Paladin's melee weapon and portable cover device. When propped up to take enemy fire, and mooks will also close in without doing damage, allowing for you to use SF when they're not expecting it. When the level 6 evolution is reached, you have the option of turning your shield into a Cryo or Fire shield, which turns your heavy melee into a level 6 primer.  

**N7 Demolisher Engineer**

The Demolisher is the grenadiest grenadier that ever grenaded. If you take every grenade capacity evolution and equip the Grenade Capacity V gear

* Supply Pylon is a deployable ammo box and shield booster. When standing in the radius, which comes in very handy with the amount of grenades you're going to be throwing. 

* Arc Grenades are EMP grenades with a massive radius that shock enemies into momentary paralysis and are devastating against shields and barriers. They're also fast-acting

* Homing Grenades are large, allowing for Fire Explosions. Because they move slowly but do lots of damage, these are best used on stronger, armour-clad enemies.

1354682951.0,14b1ek,[GUIDE] How to change your FOV (PC only. Sorry console owners.),jongglr8,39,8,25,"For the lazy

***THIS INVOLVES EDITING COALESCED.BIN. DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

Hey everyone. As many of you know, this feels claustrophobic and causes motion sickness.

Fear not my friends

Proof for those who demand it: [SP Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQYxo3ec78c), and why would I make this guide and waste my time if it was impossible?

*While so far no one seems to have been banned from using this FOV adjustment

**Steps on how to change your FOV yourself:**

1. [Download this nifty program](http://wenchy.net/me3-coalesced-utility/). It will allow you to modify coalesced.bin.

2. Extract it anywhere you wish.

3. Navigate to your Mass Effect 3 directory

4. Make a back up of *coalesced.bin*. Just copy paste *coalesced.bin* with a different name.

5. Open *ME3Coalesced.exe*

6. Click File

7. Go to your CookedPCConsole folder and open *coalesced.bin*.

8. After it loads, then sfxgamemodebase. Click on bindings = (multiple).

9. Scroll down the right side of the program until you get to the very bottom with an open space with an asterisk (* &lt;- this guy) on the left side. [It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/KGig3.png)

10. Click on the open space
**( Name=""Shared_Aim""

11. Change the ""90"" in that line to the desired FOV. I use 100. Press enter. [Now it should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/uOCQf.png)

12. Click File

13. If the game stops behaving in a normal manner

**What to do when in game:** Right click (zoom) once. Now you're in a different FOV!

**FAQ**

1. **Will I get banned for using this?** *For the last time, but it's highly unlikely.*

2. **Will it affect multiplayer matchmaking?** *Nope. I have read comments that say that no one can enter the lobby when they're the host

3. **I messed up and now the game wont work.** *As I said before: restore your backup. If you don't have a backup

4. **Is there any way you can bring this to the consoles?** *People have managed to mod Mass Effect 2 in Xbox360, Playstation 3, or the Wii U.*",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14b1ek/guide_how_to_change_your_fov_pc_only_sorry/

* *Practice in single player.*  After I unlocked the BW I at N7 50 (I know, I put myself through boot camp by doing a completely fresh Infiltrator campaign on Insanity.  The first couple missions were agonizing, but damned if I didn't learn to stay in cover.

* *Transition with hybrid guns.*  If you're more comfortable with assault rifles, so the 2x on these guns will help you start to get a better feel for the zoom mechanic.  You can also throw a 2x scope on a pistol like the Carnifex to get a feel for a higher damage, lower rate of fire weapon.

* *Take your time.*  If you've been accustomed to spamming ARs and running around like a mad man, line up the shot, and take it.  Don't worry about headshots until you are reliably hitting enemies with a high degree of accuracy.  It may feel like you aren't killing people fast enough, but eventually you'll be surprised how efficiently you're killing.

* *Start with multi-shot snipers, but not everyone has these weapons.  Barring those guns, the Mantis is solid, as is the Widow if you have it.

* *Don't get tunnel vision.*  When you're frequently looking at one small region of the map through the scope

* *Learn to reload cancel.*  Most people on this board know how to do this, I'm putting it here again.  When you reload, as soon as the red ammo bar in the lower left fills, you've got it.  At this moment, you can cancel the rest of the character reload animation (maybe 30-40% of the total reload time?) by performing some other action, like cloak, run, medigel

Searching for sniper tips (specifically reload cancel) is what originally brought me to this site.  Hopefully these help a few of you.

With the other Soldiers, the Batarian can control mooks and bosses alike without relenting, and the Vanilla Turian is capable of magnifying the effectiveness of fully automatic weapons. How can the Vanilla Human Soldier compete with the likes of these?

The answer is simple: the Vanilla Human Soldier is flexible and well rounded. In between reasonable defenses, there isn't a challenge a Vanilla Human Soldier can't take. All three powers (Adrenaline Rush, Concussive Shot, Frag Grenades) are great and should never be skipped unless under the most dire of circumstances.

While not directly capable of having heavy shielding, Adrenaline Rush can allow the Human Soldier to do some limited tanking. Rank 4 Hardening gives 40% damage reduction while Rank 6 Shield Boost restores and adds 500 temporary Shield points in case of emergencies. Both of those give the Vanilla Human Soldier enough tools to deflect most hits.
Attack-wise, Javelin, Saber, and Paladin. That isn't to say that weapons with larger magazines like the Typhoon (which can be infinitely chained with Adrenaline Rush) and the Hurricane don't benefit from it as well. The ""second"" magazine also gets a damage boost, making such burst attacks even stronger than usual. Second, both Concussive Shot and Frag Grenades can detonate Tech Combos. This makes the Vanilla Human Soldier a great complement to Tech-heavy teams as there will always be a detonator ready when this kit is on the field. Of particular note, Concussive Shot is the fastest Tech Detonator in the game (that doesn't depend on Barriers, either by staggering them or forcing them into a new position. With the Shredder evolution, perfectly complementing Concussive Shot's anti-minion ability.

On the utility side, also mentioned previously, is perfect for lining up an enemy into the crosshairs of a powerful weapon. This makes said weapon much more powerful as headshots usually results in a dead enemy. The homing ability can even hit around corners, sending enemies flying out of cover. Frag Grenades have a small proximity fuse along with an excellent trajectory arc that makes it easy to hit enemies behind cover and around corners. With enough practice, no enemy can escape the wrath of a Vanilla Human Soldier.

So there you have it, the Vanilla Human Soldier should never be underestimated.",[Class Discussion],False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,Spectre,moderator

I haven't posted a build in a while

So what you are going to do is go and build [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/NShadow/MDKIL/Hurricane10AU5BB5/Wraith10AP5BG5/StrengthEnhancer3/PowerEfficiencyModule4/OmniCapacitors5/).

The Wraith is interchangeable depending on the enemy. Against Cerberus I like the Scorpion to deal with Phantoms and against Geth I like the Reegar. Reapers or Collectors I will take the Wraith though. You really just want a hard hitting weapon for times you are uncloaked (Which in this build

So the playstyle. Its pretty simple

Tactical cloak, but just make sure that enemy is isolated from a group. The wraith is there to make sure he is dead after striking him. Heavy melee also works. Tactical cloak is evolved so you don't de-cloak after your first strike, and also for duration so it leaves ample time to run away. Running away is something you will be doing a lot. You will also want to be cloaked for the majority of the time aswell. 

When you find a fatlas, or Warp ammo. Incendiary works well too. When the shields are gone, I like meleeing the crap out of them just because its satisfying. **Disclaimer, I am not responsible for your crushed skull when an atlas has enough of being stabbed*.

Electric Slash is my GTFO assistant. If I find myself surrounded by mooks

**Racial Passives and Traits**

The Geth are known for their strong shields over relatively poor health, (Soldier, Engineer and Infiltrator) carry the same Passives and Fitness. They're the same as the rest of most species', but all Geth have reduced AR and SR weight as a level 6 evolution in Passives, and they also come with a Geth weapon damage bonus, increasing the damage output of the Geth Plasma SMG, Geth Plasma Shotgun

The Geth heavy melee is unique; it is the fastest in the game and is able to be  either sustained or used repetitively very quickly, it drains them quite rapidly. Holding it will send out an electric shock to nearby enemies, with each pulse draining your shields a bit. 

Each Geth also comes with *Hunter Mode*. It is a sustained power that increases all forms of damage, and can be evolved to increase power damage, recharge speed, and rate of fire. It also grants you partial X-ray vision, allowing you to see through smoke and walls. The downside is that when active, it reduces your shields by half, and the screen becomes 'computerised'

**Geth Trooper Soldier**

The Geth Trooper is one of the most powerful close quarter combatants in the game. His two sustained powers, making him very deadly against hordes of enemies. 

* Flamer is a short-range flamethrower that is devastatingly powerful against health and armour. Not only does it kill enemies very quickly, allowing for others to detonate a Fire Explosion. With the right evolutions, combined with his other two powers, the Trooper's Flamer is the strongest in the game. 

* Fortification reduces damage taken, when purged, increases melee damage a significant amount. Taking power synergy at rank 5 is practically required, as it ramps up your Flamer damage output. 

**Geth Engineer**

Being that they're a race of machines, this platform greatly accentuates a team, helping to suppress, spot targets and strip shields. 

* Geth Turret is a small floating platform deployed by the Engineer that will lay down fire on any enemy in its line of sight

* Overload is a tech power that is best used against shields, able to do up to and over 3,000 damage against shields and barriers. 

**Geth Infiltrator**

This guy is the ultimate sniper. With the right evolutions and equipment, enemies will not survive long. 

* Tactical Cloak is the standard Infiltrator power, allowing you to damage boost many of your shots 

* Proximity Mine is a mine that will explode when an enemy comes within its radius. Quite powerful,,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1358150048.0,,True

1. Best new expansion class: Asari Huntress. The TGI is amazing but he's a little boring he's so good. Honorable mention to the N7 Paladin. Love that guy.

2. Worst new expansion class: Turian Saboteur. Poor guy has horrible power synergy and his defining ability had been nerfed WAY too hard.

3. Worst loadout you've seen in the lobby: Fury with a Typhoon I. WTF. I was intrigued for about 2 rounds and then I just settled on getting my revive medal.

4. Most inspiring loadout you've seen in the lobby: Batarian Soldier with a Talon. I'll never give it up. The first guy I saw play it was like Kurt Russell in Tombstone during the montage.

5. Most WTF? nerf: Vindicator nerf made NO sense. It was good but hardly overpowered.

6. Best buff: Acolyte charge removal was nuts. A great gun moved up to God Tier for a short period. Changed the game for a bunch of classes. Honorable mention: Singularity. HA is a new class.

7. Worst Nerf: Smash. It really took an awesome class down too many pegs. The Ex-Cerbs aren't unplayable

8. Favorite Hazard map: Glacier Hazard..it's the only one that feels...Hazardous.

9. Worst Hazard map: Giant. Ohs noes

10. Highest MP moments?: My first round with the Huntress was pretty epic...scored 120k, Cyclonic II, Shottie Amp. 

11. Lowest MP moments?: Too many to name. Every time I try to Drellguard is a tragedy. I rage missile Turrets, and other annoying things randomly. My first round against Geth on my Huntress. I didn't have an Acolyte and well..yeah..she was pretty ordinary.

12. Best Weapon discovery due to a post in this Reddit: CSR X. I ignored this thing after the first time out..man was I wrong about it. Burst firing this thing is just insane and it goes so well with a variety of builds. 

11. Favorite New build thanks to this Reddit: BF3 God of Hellfire. I like a lot of builds, because it really sped up my HS play.

1356360769.0,15dioc,Fixing biotic/tech dissonance,ginja_ninja,37,10,23,"Probably my least favorite thing about this game and something I'm sure anyone who enjoys playing biotics knows is that having tech-based teammates severely hampers your ability to be effective. If you join a pub as asari adept and have teammates playing N7 paladin

This has to do with tech powers almost always acting as primers and layering themselves over biotic primers. If you're trying to detonate a biotic explosion on an armored boss and there's also a paladin spamming snap freeze/energy drain on it or a teammate firing their disruptor-ammo-equipped weapon at it, you should be able to outright *kill* a boss's armor with *multiple* explosions in the time it takes a warp to expire. It's also frustrating because biotics do nothing to hinder tech players at all, and people who play tech classes exclusively may not even realize how much of a hindrance they are to biotics.

The way to fix this seems rather obvious: in cases where both a biotic and tech primer are layered on a target, they wouldn't really even feel a change. So for example, say a target gets primed with warp and then hit with snap freeze. If another teammate hits it with a prox mine next the cryo explosion would still go off, but if the biotic tosses a throw, the biotic explosion would go off. Biotics would still be able to detonate tech explosions with their detonator powers so long as the target wasn't already primed for a biotic explosion. This way you could do the warp &gt; throw &gt; throw technique and still set off your own explosion as well as helping your teammate set of theirs, but you wouldn't have to worry about the tech getting re-primed before you get a chance to detonate yours.

It seems like the way to actually implement this would be to categorize your biotic and tech detonators separately and set up a simple script to check and see if the target is primed for a biotic explosion when hit by a biotic detonator and instruct the game to ignore the latest tech primer and cause the biotic explosion to go off instead. If the target is not biotically primed

Basically I just want you guys to consider this and make sure I haven't made a misstep in logic somewhere. The way I see it, but it would be amazing if they could. If you guys agree, we should try to bring it to their attention by maybe posting a petition on BSN or sending them an email.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15dioc/fixing_biotictech_dissonance/

I've been buying PSPs and SPs and recording the Ultra Rare drop rates.

Now if my calculations are correct buying Spectre Packs give you almost double the ammount of URs for the same number of credits

Initially I bought 100 of each

100 PSPs gave 7URs - Drop rate of 7% - or 1 Ur per 14 PSPS / 1
100 SPs gave 7URs - Drop rate of 7% - or 1 Ur per 14SPs / 840

I thought it was interesting that both packs gave exactly the same drop rate.

I then carried on buying to compare 10 Million credits of each pack

10 Million Credits gave
101 PSPs (9,386,000 Credits each
167 SPs (10,000 Credits each

1352960690.0,1388bf,It Takes Two To Tango: Human Ingenuity,RepublicanShredder,31,1,14,"**Preface**

So, but time is precious. At least this week is full of time-intensive activities.

Remember those cool team guides we had a bit ago? Those were nice, these combos should be able to pick up the slack.

**Introduction**

So as you may know, especially with the new Fire and Cryo Explosion buffs"". 

So I thought about other classes that would be great primers and it hit me: Human Engineer would be perfect. With both Fire Explosions and Tech Bursts, so everyone can pull off this combo.

So I got fittyman to help me and he went Human Engineer while I went Human Soldier. The results were a fountain of tears of unfathomable sadness. From the enemies

So the combo revolves around the Human Engineer as a primer of Tech Combos and the Human Soldier as the detonator of said combos. Simple

**The Human Engineer**

*What does he do?*- This guy is the brains and primer of this combo. Depending on the defenses and number of enemies around, and cast powers non-stop.

*How do I go about building him?*- Fittyman uses something along [these lines](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Human/PPKOA/Indra6AS5AT5/Hurricane3AU5BB5///OmniCapacitors5/) for his Human Engineer.

What's important is a high cooldown (say 150% or above) and having 6 ranks in both Overload and Incinerate to increase Tech Combo damage. Having a Chain Overload is also nice

**The Human Soldier**

*What does he do?*- The Human Soldier is the brawn and detonator of this combo. Typically acting as a tank for the Human Engineer

*How should I go about building him?*- I typically run this kit along [these lines](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Human/ONEFR/Revenant10AD5AC5////WarfighterPackage5/).

What's important is having 6 points in Concussive Shot for stronger Tech Combos and having at least 3 points into Frag Grenades so that he can still detonate Tech Combos

**Tactics**

While this will require some co-ordination

Ideally

The Soldier may wish to use Adrenaline Rush to maximize damage on a boss enemy

Soldiers should also make sure to prevent too much heat going towards the Engineer

Engineers need to constantly prime targets and make sure the Soldier is not overwhelmed by enemies. Tech powers and Explosions are excellent at slowing down the enemy so the Soldier doesn't get killed from being swarmed.

So when should either Tech Bursts or Fire Explosions be used? 
This list is derived from experience

*Tech Burst (Overload)*- Synthetic enemies not on armor

Targets ready to be detonated for a Tech Burst have electric bolts running around their body.

*Fire Explosions (Incinerate)*- Organic enemies on Health

Targets ready to be detonated for a Fire Explosion have flames going around their bodies.


**Conclusion**

We learned that the Human Soldier and Human Engineer can make for a potent pair of characters. Constant Tech Bursts/Fire Explosions  will decimate enemies and makes each character much more effective in unison than running off on their own.

While I certainly think is an optimal combo to exploit fast Tech Combos

So

Just remember when trying this duo out,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,,t3_1388bf
1348790849.0,10lbwp,The Capacitor (Geth Engineer),RepublicanShredder,38,9,24,"So we all love having teammates that are team players. Justicars create good old Biotic Spheres for both defense and offence

While Infiltrators are good at reviving downed teammates, and stripping shields to stun enemies, no one can keep teammates alive better than the [Geth Engineer](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#23QKKIDf3@0DE@@R4Q4@0@0).

**Geth Turret**- Specced for shield recharge. Why skip the final evolution for restore frequency? In between the high power recharge because of the low weight and [this useful technqiue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_iBqqO-Oes)

Don't forget to send one down next to a teammate you are going to revive. It will either shield you when reviving or give the newly resurrected teammate plenty of shields. The flamethrower upgrade will ward off most attackers

**Hunter Mode**- Because I rely on Overload so much

I advise turning Hunter Mode off when personal safety is more important than dealing damage. Examples include hacking objectives (when enemies can easily be seen because no powers are being used then)

**Overload**- Gotta love crowd control. Recall that when an enemy initially loses its shields/barriers

**5 in Power Passives/3 in Fitness**- I chose to maximize power damage

1346119762.0,yxsu6,Max McTankerson:  Krogan Sentinel Build,InterwebNinja,30,0,26,"Way back in the day, and I left my poor Krogan friend behind

This past weekend, I really enjoyed this class.  [Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/Krogan/PALLR/Falcon10AE5AD5/Claymore10BH5AP5/ShotgunRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule3/GrenadeCapacity5/) is the build I am using.  This build has more or less been discussed on this forum before, but only in a limited capacity and many many months ago, by posters whose names I don't recognize.  That also reflects my in-game experience, as I rarely see a Krogan Sentinel anymore.

Anyway, this character has the highest effective shields of any character in the game.  Without any supporting gear / equipment, it comes out to roughly 2500 shields and 1900 health.  Unfortunately, because he lacks the shield recharge ability from biotic charge, he's a little more vulnerable than his Vanguard brethren.  Fortunately, this guy has one thing that the Vanguards don't have - the ability to ignore cooldown.  With no points in incinerate, he can carry whatever he damn well pleases.  I find this pleasing, all Krogans carry big guns

Since the sentinel isn't going to be a great weapons damage class and he's going to be taking a lot of fire, can be used to set off fire explosions.  ~~Fire explosions are generally tricky to pull off, but given how high the damage of the Lift Grenade is with this build (1750), it's a lot easier~~ (edit:  not as relevant with new mechanics for Tech Combos)  Note, Fire Explosions are still relatively tricky to pull of with Lift Grenades, despite the balance changes to tech combos.  I'm not entirely clear what they are capable of detonating at this point, so if anyone wants to clarify, a crowd control weapon (e.g. Falcon

While the Falcon and grenades are going to be great for your trash mobs, too.  I will be disappointed if you pick a pistol or an SMG, though.  Think big.

Finally

* Lift grenades have a 1.5x bonus against barriers

* Because lift grenades both set up and detonate biotic explosions

* Just keep an eye on your shields and always be close to cover.  This guy is strong

That's all I can think of.  It's not the best class

*1)* Buy recruit packs until you have maxed out all of the common weapons and mods.  This really should not take very long if you start doing Silver and Gold runs with a solid team.

*2)*  Buy all the veteran packs until you have maxed out all uncommon weapons

*3)* Finally

Why do I buy in this order?  Two basic reasons:  

*1)*  Buying lots of the cheapest packs first ensures you have decent weapons
*2)*  As you max out a particular weapon or mod

Cerberus is annoying, Concussion Shot and Submission Net.  The Atlas can be a pain, but being considered synthetic, they have some rather embarrassing weaknesses.

But *Reapers*?  They have 3 enemies immune to basic CC(Crowd control), without needing to take the cover.  

They can shield their allies with metal plates, standing around where they died results in you taking additional damage.  

Got hit by a ball of lightning by a Banshee? Better take cover and restore your shields.  *Nope*.  You're now taking damage over time. Better hope you're not low on health!

Not only that

You break out and take cover to recover your shields

That's when you notice that Banshee caught up and is standing right next to you.  Game over.


Nothing else compares to fighting Reapers.  I only wish Cerberus and Geth would put up half the fight that the Reapers do.

**Weapon Bugs, and Mechanics**

* The Cerberus Harrier's in-cover recoil is larger than it's out-of-cover recoil (/u/mrcle123)
* Weight-adding weapon mods
* The Striker can be ramped up and reap the benefits of Tactical Cloak bonuses without ever breaking Cloak. Simply ramp up
* Using weapons with infinite ammo (Particle Rifle, Collector SMG, etc.) on a Drell will cause a player's aim to drift downward while firing. (/u/RepublicanShredder)

**Map Bugs

* If you go down on maps with railings or areas open to off-stage areas (Rio, Dagger, and more), [you can ""fall off"" the map and be auto-resurrected at the Landing Zone](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1jd0cy/crowdsourcing_a_college_post_would_you_kindly/cbdgvcv), given that you are near these railings/areas.. (/u/dahngrest) 
* Unequal elevations grant ""sync-kill immunity"": boss enemies will not instantly kill you if they are not on the same elevation (/u/dahngrest, be sync-killed if the enemy is standing on the same stair/parallel to your elevation on a ramp.
* Large storage containers in Rio make use of the above mechanic
* Both Reactor and Hazard Reactor have rafters in which enemies can get stuck (most commonly Cerberus). This can't be prevented
* The doors or a door in Hazard Reactor may close permanently after turning on the reactor. No known fixes. (/u/ryanadc)
* The seeker swarm of Hazard Glacier can be expanded by shooting it. It does less damage in this form. (/u/mrcle123)

**Character-Specific Bugs

* Asari Huntress does not get weapon damage bonus from cloak; instead
* N7 Paladin's Snap Freeze only requires Reach (Evo 4B) for 2x Cryo Explosion damage. Evo 6B is bugged and should not be taken. The AIU's Snap Freeze works as intended.
* The Alliance Infiltration Unit (AIU) does not get evo 6B's shotgun damage bonus off-host. (/u/mrcle123)
* the N7 Shadow's Tech Combo evolution of Electric Slash

**Power-Specific Bugs

* Frag Grenade evolution 6A only gives +50% instead of +75% damage. (/u/mrcle123)
* Flamer lowers your movement speed while active. You can move at normal speed by using Flamer *while firing* the Reegar Carbine Shotgun
* Tactical Scan evo 5A
* Marksman and the heavy pistol's Cranial Trauma mod's headshot bonuses do not work on boss enemies. (/u/mrcle123)
* Sabotage evo 6B
* Sometimes Annihilation Field's animation will reverse (will not prime when animated

**In-Game Bugs

* [Warp stacks ridiculously with Incendiary Ammo](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18os9u/can_you_help_me_piece_together_how_incendiary/c8gn7pv), Flamer, N7 Paladin fire shield evo (/u/mrcle123).
* Incendiary Ammo's damage over time stacks with itself, Collector Sniper, etc.). [Details here](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14033200/1#14033200). (/u/AaronEh)
* Sometimes your powers and weapon will not respond to controls. This can be repaired by using a heavy melee attack. (/u/holku1984)
* If the above happens while you are a Volus
* Entering cover from strange angles may leave you ""stuck"" a few paces away from the actual cover. Rid the problem by releasing all movement keys. (/u/602).
* The reloading animation can be canceled on all platforms. [PC players can find a demonstration here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/191guy/me3_coop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_reload/).

* Sometimes using a shield-refilling ability (Shield Boost, by having the shields destroyed, or by getting downed and resurrected. (/u/TheChosenOne127, /u/HiddenIncome)
* Dying from enemy fire during a sync-kill animation will sometimes instantly revive you without using medi-gel. Conditions for revival unknown. (/u/mrcle123)
* A well-timed Ops Pack can prevent a sync-kill due to maximum damage reduction. [Details found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1jd0cy/crowdsourcing_a_college_post_would_you_kindly/cbdjfd3) (/u/mrcle123)
* Using hard cover (making your character lean against the wall) grants damage reduction that can even mitigate damage over time.

**Objective-Specific Bugs

* Cloaking during an Escort does not add movement speed to the drone. You must be both in the vicinity and visible to enemies.
* Dodging out of a hack-circle immediately after activating it will still count you as a hacking player (/u/mrcle123). If successful
* Package recoveries (Objects Recovered) can be expedited on PC

**Enemy-Specific Bugs

* A brute's charge attack covers more area than the animation suggests.(/u/zetversus)
* Banshees can turn invisible. They can be spotted by their brackets
* Many enemies bulky enemies
* With more than 2m penetration
* Geth Hunters can shoot through thin walls if their guns are phasing through the wall. (/u/mrcle123)
* Phantoms and Praetorians have bubbles that negate all power damage that usually lasts a few seconds. Sometimes they may become permanent
* If you are taken down by a Husk's or Abomination's grab animation

**Platform-Specific Bugs

* PC only: Shockwave's Radius evolution
* PC only: Players can ""run"" the 2-package objective. See demonstrations [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18vzrr/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_video/).

1373095457.0,1hqmmm,War Machine (N7 Destroyer),RepublicanShredder,35,7,51,"**Introdcution**

Now some of you here may be familiar with the N7 Destroyer. I put up a [generic Destroyer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14yh1u/the_marauder_n7_destroyer/) back in the day and it was a kit I most desired when the Earth DLC was launched (Was it the last card to max out my rare manifest? You bet.). Typically most Destroyers go with Devastator Mode and either Hawk Missiles or Multi-Frags. Now there's good reason for this as Devastator Mode can boost stats on weapons that most equipment cannot, there already is a [DM-less Destroyer on BBLoB](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/165g34/the_carpetbomber_n7_destroyer_build/). So why am I writing this? Well, the current build is written with the intent that skipping DM is a little gimmick. I personally see it as legitimate playstyle choice with plenty of nuance in it. I've also come to learn a lot from playing this style with a few tricks that may come an help you.

I should start off by stating why I even tried this style in the first place. It all started off with the advent of the Reckoning DLC. Two things occurred in that DLC. The first is the presence of the Geth Juggernaut, increased spare ammo, and team support ability made him better at the job. Second, the Venom was a new addition to the multiplayer arsenal. As I have said before, I've been ogling this gun for a long time and I do love my grenade launchers. Put two and two together along with some inspiration from /u/spark2's post and I went to work. I need to state that the choices I made on this kit did not come from a linear process and several choices melded together at once, with further refinement after the initial idea was set in place. The final product can be seen here in either [Kalence](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#28!1B06535!3C05525!23O533!.809G) or [Narida](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/NDestroyer/AKMLR/Venom10AO5AL5/CerberusHarrier10BF5AC5/ShotgunRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/GrenadeCapacity5/), using Incendiary Rounds as the ammo of choice. Keep in mind this build requires some advanced weaponry and a poor manifest will severely hinder you capabilities using this setup.

Before I get into gory detail, both have extensive military experience, both use pragmatic fighting styles (no fancy lasers shows, PPR being a potential exception) and finally both have their natural armor colors being black and grey. Plus, the name is BADASS.

^^^Honorary ^^^names ^^^can ^^^be ^^^Mr. ^^^Torgue ^^^and ^^^Michael ^^^Bay ^^^because ^^^explosions.

**Power Evolutions**

*Passives*- Considering our primary weapon will be the Venom

*Devastator Mode*- An effective power, and Banshees). On top of that, DM doesn't really boost any stat the Venom can benefit from.

*Hawk Missile Launcher*- An excellent crowd controlling power that automatically fires every 3 seconds or so. All the top evolutions were taken as they are the best imo. The shield penalty reduction makes it much easier to use armor modules that aren't Cyclonic Modulators (though I think those are still the best to use), Hydra missiles can stagger everything that isn't a boss, Pyro, or Dragoon. Given that Hydras can force a dodge on those two enemies and the Venom can stagger everything anyways, this leads to excellent crowd control possibilities against non-bosses. Note that Hydra missiles *cannot* detonate Power Combos.

*Multi-Frag Grenades*- Put all the points into getting the best burst possible. Damage/Damage/Grenade Count offers the best burst and with Grenade Capacity these bursts can be used quite often. This power will be used most often for instant stunning of enemies and detonating Power Combos either from Incendiary Rounds or teammates. And at 2000+ Newtons per grenade

**Weapon Choices**

So the power evolution chocies were pretty easy and can meld with most weapons. However, somewhat). With the lack of cover penetration present in explosives, I decided to carry one explosive weapon (given how that explosive weapon along with Multi-Frags and Hawk Missiles would give limitless crowd control as is) and one penetrating weapon to deal with enemies that is vulnerable to it like Ravagers, Atlases, Guardians, and cover-happy enemies at bad angles.

*Explosive Weapon* 

So there are 5 explosive weapons (that don't need Explosive Rounds to explode) in the game right now. They are the *Krysae*, *Scorpion*, and *Venom*, in the order of personal effectiveness. Here is my thought process on choosing the Venom, aside from personal love of it. Since all 5 of these weapons shoot projectiles, they can instantly prime for Fire Explosions upon impact. 

1. *Krysae*- While it does use the relatively abundant Sniper Rail Amp

2. *Striker*- A ramp-up weapon. While great with DM

3. *Falcon*- Now we're getting somewhere. It's an excellent stagger machine and can bounce off of walls

4. *Scorpion*- Now in the Ultra-Rare category, so getting around corners is the issue. Weapon of choice if you don't have a Venom or if you want to use a Shotgun as the penetrating weapon.

5. *Venom*- [I've already exalted this weapon before](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19zwly/fangs_of_fury_venom_shotgun_discussion/), double tapping lets me chew them up in record time. Given it's flexibility and power, it's my explosive weapon of choice. 

*Penetrating Weapon*

So there are plenty of weapons that can penetrate cover with the addition of a piercing mod. Assault Rifles seem to be the best option with the addition of the High Velocity Barrel that negates 90% of armor damage reduction and gives a good 1.35m of penetration along with it. Since weight isn't an issue, and Sniper Rifles need both piercing mods to get a similar effect (they are also ineffective at close range due to the no-scope penalty and most have a poor RoF, requiring impressive aim). So I put a table of the most common Assault Rifles I used and listed their benefits and drawbacks so you can come to your own conclusion on what is best.

|Assault Rifle|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Argus|Decent damage output, adequate accuracy from cover|Recoil and accuracy are issues out of cover, burst nature makes it hard to track moving enemies, small-ish magazine size|
|Collector Rifle|Good accuracy and excellent recoil control, good reload speed|Low damage output, small-ish magazine size|
|Harrier|Great reload speed, good punch per shot|Poor recoil/stability (bug worsens the issue), low ammo count, small magazine|
|Lancer|Good magazine size, decent punch per pellet, good accuracy|Recoil issue, overheating is a problem, insufficient mod slots to fix main issues|
|Typhoon|Good penetrative power, good magazine size|Ramp-up needed for best effect, low accuracy out of cover, can chew through ammo quickly|
|PPR|Good RoF, ineffective at sustained DPS|
|Saber|Great damage per shot, manageable recoil|Semi-automatic nature makes it difficult against moving targets, sustained firing wears down fingers, does not benefit as much from a HVB as other guns|
|Valkyrie|Good punch per shot, manageable recoil|Burst firing makes it difficult against moving targets and wears down fingers, headshot multiplier ineffective against bosses|

Personally, I take the Typhoon to chew through them at range. I had a good time with the Saber as it blends both, but the semi-automatic nature of the Saber put me off my game when I'm not prepared.

For the more advanced users around here, requiring Hawk Missiles and DoT to finish off most enemies. It offers great burst damage due to the single shot nature if you hit the target. On the flip side, you get about two-thirds the effective sustained damage output (21.64 seconds vs. 14.61 seconds against a Gold Geth Prime (no headshots) according to the weapons calculator on the sidebar) compared to an equally leveled Typhoon, with the need to be scoped in to deal full damage.

**Equipment**

*Ammo Power*- Incendiary Rounds were chosen because it is effective against Armor and can prime for Fire Explosions. Against the Geth, but I'd make an effort to put Incendiary Rounds on even if it is only Level 1.

*Weapon Amp*- Since the main source of DPS is the Venom

*Armor Module*- This is where you can get flexible with what you want to use. I find Cyclonic Modulators and Adrenaline Modules to be the most effective while Power Efficiency (minimal effect) and Power Amplifiers (does not affect force

*Gear*- Since Multi-Frag Grenades are really good

1363977745.0,1atbn0,Racially Charged: Weapon Restrictions,RepublicanShredder,40,11,60,"So some of us do enjoy a challenge by putting restrictions on ourselves. Sometimes it involves everyone playing as the same race/kit

In an attempt to create the weapon/race challenge, the Avenger was manufactured by the Elkoss Combine (Volus), but the gun is used by nearly every race. Hence, I called the user Mercenary (no restrictions). I tried my best to come up with the most appropriate users

That leads me to define some terms when it comes to the user list. 

* Mercenary means anyone can use the weapon in question. Geth, Human, etc. can all use Mercenary weapons

* Humans are divided into two subdivisions: Alliance and Cerberus. Cerberus are the two Ex-Cerberus kits (Adept and Vanguard) while every other Human belongs to the Alliance. I once considered subdividing the Alliance into N7 and not N7

* Blood Pack members include the Krogan and Vorcha.

* Council weapons are available for anyone who is a part of Council Space. This consists of Salarians, and Humans along with the Drell and Volus.

* Anything with an * means either that I am unsure about it's true user or the user may not fit what other people may think and thus will have a comment below the tables.

I hope that these tables will give people some fun ideas when playing with interesting restrictions (e.g. all Salarians, I always enjoy seeing good orange envelopes when I hit F5.

1363249844.0,1a9w90,The Boom Collector:  Collector Adept Build,InterwebNinja,34,7,19,"####OVERVIEW

""No!""

Well, and I'd like to share some of my thoughts on it.  It has one of the most unique powers in the game (Dark Sphere), and it's very difficult to find a build that feels right.  I've respecced six times now, and I think I've finally landed someplace that's worth sharing.

####BUILD

I'm going to split this into a couple different

[**HERE**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AwakenedCollector/NILIF/ArcPistol10BK5AI5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerEfficiencyModule3/CommandoPackage5/) is Build 2.  In the case that you don't have the CSMG (or it's a lower level than you'd like to use)


####POWERS

***Dark Sphere:***  While there are effective ways of playing this class without this power, really, it's a very good power if you've got the cooldown to use it frequently enough.

With these builds, not the DPS (note that narida's online class builder that we use on this subreddit still isn't right for the DoT).  At best, you can spec it to about 100 DPS, which, really, is peanuts compared to the damage you're going to be putting out through detonations or your weapon.  For the playstyle recommended in this guide, I think it makes more sense to take Recharge Speed over the extra DoT.  As is, though several heavier enemies like Pyros will take some of the DoT before their shields are dissipated.

Really, take Radius if you like - I find 7m is plenty, but 9m might feel even better - I haven't tried speccing it that way.

Note, and a DS detonation was enough to stagger a Gold Atlas ([*video here*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US-lqRCRn-c&amp;feature=youtu.be)).

***Seeker Swarm / Fitness:*** Seeker Swarms are used just for the damage protection.  Because of the way the damage protection formulas work

***Dark Channel:*** Fairly standard DC build, and this is why I put the full 6 points in the power.

***Passive:*** The two builds differ significantly in the choices here.  Build 1 is intended to max weapons damage from Prothean / Collector weapons.  Note the Ancient Weapon bonus is multiplicative and applies to both your weapon and ammo damage.

Build 2 is for other weapons

####WEAPONS

Build 1 is designed around using the CSMG.  The CSMG actually does a very respectable amount of damage on this build, having a higher ranked CSMG helps quite a bit.  Partially because of the weight and damage, but more so because of the clip capacity.  The first 10-11 shots you fire with the CSMG consume double ammo, so it eats through clips relatively quickly.  Regardless, even a CSMG *I* can do burst damage of 1600 DPS against Health / Shield / Barriers, and 2400 against Armor on this build.  Each clip of a CSMG *I* would hold about 5300 worth of potential damage against non-Armor defenses, and 8000 damage against armor.  Reload on the weapon initiates instantaneously if it doesn't overheat, so effectively a 3 second reload if you nearly empty the clip.

A CSR would work as well.  In fact, I'd personally go with the CSMG to keep that cooldown as low as possible.  I would stay away from the PPR on this build / playstyle - it doesn't really synergize well with the casting / detonating of DS, IMO.

In case you don't have the CSMG or the CSR at decent levels, too, but I'd keep an eye on your cooldown.  DS is very sensitive to this because of its long base cooldown (24 seconds).  A low ranked UR pistol like the Paladin might add a second to DS cooldown, which is really quite noticeable.  Ideally, with Build 2 you should be able cast / detonate DS every 6-7 seconds.  Anything much longer doesn't feel as effective, in my experience.

####EQUIPMENT

I see two choices for your Armor Module - either a Power Amp or a Power Efficiency Amp.  You can shave close to a second off your DS cooldown with an Efficiency Amp

Warp Ammo is a must for this class.  You are a priming machine with DS and DC.

####PLAYSTYLE

I play this as a Close / Mid range class because you generally don't want to have to wait for DS to travel long distances before detonating.  Fortunately, so use that to your advantage.

There are quite a few variations on how you can order your power and weapons use with this class, and the distance of the engagement.  The table below shows some of the ways I might deal with different encounters.

Range|Size of Group|Enemy|Action|Notes
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---
Close / Mid|1|lower-tier|DC -&gt; Weapon|maybe just weapon
Close / Mid|&gt;1|lower-tier|DS -&gt; DS Detonate -&gt; Weapon|May throw in a DC before detonation for stagger effect if too many enemies
Close / Mid|1|Phantom|DC -&gt; move out of LoS -&gt; Weapon or DS -&gt; DS detonate or both|DC will take down Barriers in 5-6 seconds
Close / Mid|&gt;1|Phantom|DC -&gt; run|no shame in retreat
Close / Mid|1|Boss|DS -&gt; DC -&gt; DS Detonate -&gt; Weapon|don't want to trigger DS cooldown before applying DC
Close / Mid|&gt;1|boss|""""|May missile in late wave
Long|boss|DC-&gt;weapon| |probably will try to close distance
Long|any|any barrier / armor enemy|DC|May as well keep DC productive if you don't need it at that exact moment

Most of these DS detonations should be happening fairly close to your position.  This isn't a class I'd hunker down and start launching them halfway across the map.  You're generally better off closing the distance and then launching / detonating quickly.  Most of the time, I find it's best to first launch the DS (which doesn't trigger cooldown), then DC, then detonate DS.

But often, as a single cast can kill a Gold Phantom in about 15 seconds without you having to do anything else.  So, if you see one across the map, throw out a Dark Channel and move on to business elsewhere.  DS can take care of most of your priming, provided your cooldown is quick enough.

As for Ascension Stance, IMO.  More importantly, given I play the class at Close / Mid range for the most part, I'd rather not have the penalty to my durability.

And finally, you're usually going to get more damage just from firing you weapon, since those explosions will be so weak (844 on Gold, had you put 6 points in both SS and DS).  Against a group of enemies, I could see it having some value, but I seem to have a hard time finding opportunities where it's going to do much for me.  And if you launch off one swarm, what next?  Do you take the time to launch out the other two and reset the power, and that has worked well for me.

####SUMMARY

This class is a lot of fun.  I do think that these particular builds are most useful up through Gold.  DS doesn't have as much value against boss enemies, IMO, that sort of defeats the fun of the class.  Dark Sphere is the heart and soul of this class, and I'd hate to be playing without it.

1362361589.0,19m011,Team Build: Holy Trinity,FecalSplatter,40,9,27,"**Introduction:**  This team build plays off the MMORPG idea of the ""Holy Trinity"".  The Holy Trinity (for those of you that don’t play MMORPGs) is the idea that you need three things for a successful group: a tank

**The Tank:**  Geth Juggernaut.  Without question this character is the best tank in the game.  His ability clog a choke point or stand tall in an open field surrounded by enemies is simply unmatched.  Not only do you have insane health/shields

* Hex Shield, and size.

* Siege Pulse.  Radius, which means you survive longer.  Your goal as the tank is to survive, not to hurt things.  

* Geth Turret

* Geth Juggernaut.  Weapon Damage

* Hardened Platform.  All durability.  You are a tank and you need those health/shield/drain boosts.  Melee damage is unimportant because you aren’t trying to hurt your enemies with your heavy melee

**The Healer:**  Volus Engineer.  [Basically you will follow this build](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1545zn/volus_viable_possibility_impressive_technical/) (Credit to I_pity_the_fool).  Your goal is not to hurt things (even though you will end up doing so).  Your goal is to enable your team to hurt things.  Your prox/recon mine will increase the damage done to the enemies who are swarming the tank.  Your Shield Regen will not only heal the tank, the tanks job becomes MUCH more difficult.

**Damage Dealers:** This is the flexible part of the build.  Your damage dealers need to be able to put out as much hurt on the enemy as they can.  This can be done several ways and largely depends on your friend's play styles.  Biotic Primer/Detonator combos(my favorite), or Infiltrators with Black Widows...  the choice is yours.  Whatever you go with you need to make sure they stay alive and keep putting bullets/powers into the enemy.  If you die, you cant make the enemy die.  

My favorite match was when we used the Asari Justicar and Krogan Shaman as damage dealers.  The Asari dropped AoE Reave on the groups that surrounded the tank and occasionally dropped an offensive evo'd Biotic Sphere on the tank to increase the damage taken by the enemy.  The Shaman just spammed Shockwave (evo'd for detonation strength) into the group to detonate all the Reaves.  It was by far the most ridiculously simple Gold match I've ever played.

**Concussive Arrows**

Now the fun starts.  Take grenade capacity, but the extra grenades help.  If you're okay with a lower capacity, go ahead and skip this and throw it into the trip mine, it's not like I have a gun to your head, I mean jeez.

**Armor-Piercing Arrows**

The highlight of this build.  Take damage, so get used to 'em!

**Passives and the like**

**Elite Mercenary**

Power Damage, or your teammates are also using grenade classes, or whatever, you don't have to worry!  Just chill for a second and he'll poop a few arrows out for ya!

**Omni-Bow Mastery**

Damage, take damage all the way across the board.  

**Weapons

I like to run this guy with the Saber and the Reegar.  ~~You don't have to worry about recharge time so you can honestly take whatever weapons you want~~. As Weetchex has pointed out, I use either the Warfighter Package or Grenade Capacity.  Equipment is usually cyclonic modulator, incendiary rounds, and a strength enhancer.  

**So.**

There you have it!  Mass Effect's very own master bowman.  Just remember to play it smart

* **Weapon: Reegar Carbine** with High Velocity Barrel and Spare Capacity. Arguably the best shotgun out there

* For gear, the better.

**Tactical Cloak (6): Damage

**Snap Freeze (6): Reach, spray it from cloak before unleashing the Reegar on anything and everything on your screen.

**Repair Matrix (6): Survivability, a 20% movement speed bonus, and restores a healthy 232.50 shields per second for 22.5 seconds. I like to have these things up as much as possible, as they make up for the complete lack of points in Fitness. Replenish these as you would Stim Packs as they will be saving you a lot of Medi-gels and Ops Packs.

**Unshackled AI (6): Weapon Damage, self explanatory. Pump out as much damage as you can.

**Fitness (0):** You really don't need it. 500/750 base health and shields is already above average and you get shield regen and even a free revive from Repair Matrix. Plus cloak. Be daring

1360293767.0,183ynz,MeCoOp college 603: powers: sustained powers/abilities,Simplywaffle,43,14,47,"Hey everyone!  It's Professor Dr. Knight Simplywaffle the Third, Barrier, or introduce some great additions.  Some of the powers have de-activation effects


So, Fortification, Bloodlust, Devastator Mode, Missile Launcher, Hunter Mode and Tech Armor.



**Barrier**

The first ability demonstrated is Barrier.  Available on the Krogan Shaman and the Kroguard, it blasts the ""aura"" out.  While activated, 

* it has a base damage reduction of 25%
* reduces power recharge speed by 50%

and has a very good de-activation ability

* can hit up to 4 targets
* has a base force of 500N
* Base damage is 500 against all enemies


The power evolutions are quite good as well.  For first rank, but slightly unnoticeable on gold and higher.  For the second rank, the 30% power damage buff is great, and the shield recharge is nice on some builds.  The last evolution is a toss up between caster and tank - one cuts down power recharge speed by 30% (making it only 20%) while the other gives 10% more DR.  Any way you mix it, Barrier is a solid power.


**Blade Armor**

The next ability is Blade Armor.  Available on the batarian soldier, but while activated it gives

* base 25% damage reduction
* base 15% melee damage bonus
* base 100% melee damage return bonus
* base power recharge speed reduction of 50%

For the Batgaurd and BatSent, it takes the damage receives, triples it, and returns the damage.  On gold and plat, it divides the damage by 3, and returns it.  Hmmmm.  However, it is still a great ability, melee buffs


**Fortification**

Available on the Krogan Soldier and the Geth Trooper

* base melee damage bonus of 50%

When activated

* base 25% damage reduction
* 50% power recharge speed reduction

A poor man's Blade Armor, and you can get a max of 100% melee damage bonus when deactivated - cool for a melee krogan soldier or geth trooper.  Very nice power, if only for the power buff and melee.



**Bloodlust**

Available on the Vorcha soldier, this interesting power has an awesome feature - with every kill, regardless of how the vorcha got it, increases the stack of Bloodlust, which intensifies the base effects.  Each stack lasts for 15 seconds, leading the Vorcha to be a fast kill machine.  The visual is a red glow around the vorcha.  Sometimes, when you get a kill, and is how the build maker shows it.  The attributes are:

* base 5% movement speed buff
* base 50 health regen
* base 10% melee damage bonus
* base 60% power recharge speed reduction

There is no de-activation ability.  But, the vorcha gets faster, deadlier, and more survivable.  The evolutions are either geared towards movement speed and melee buffs, or health regen buffs.  Health regen buffs are usually preferred.  The evolution 4 and 5 grant either a 5% power damage buff or a 5% weapon damage buff.  Either is good for the vorcha.  IS THIS POWER NOT AWESOME?!?!?!?!?!?



**Devastator Mode**

Devastator Mode, making you look badass.  Once turned on, it turns the Destroyer into an almighty tank.  The base values:

* Can't dodge
* reduces movement speed by 10%
* base 10% weapon damage bonus
* base 10% rate of fire bonus
* base 15% magazine size bonus
* Can't be staggered(!)

Now you see why this is awesome.  You get more ammo, YOU CAN'T BE STAGGERED, and you're a bit slower.  The evolutions range from shield recharge speed, weapon accuracy bonus, magazine size upgrades(!), ROF bonuses, more damage bonuses, bringing the destroyer's shields up another 400 points.  Wow.  This ability pairs nicely with the next ability



**Missile Launcher**


Another Destroyer exclusive

* base missile fire time of 4 seconds
* base 200 damage
* base 200N force
* base .5 meter radius
* base 50% of base shield reduction

now you see why Missile launcher wasn't liked.  low damage, it can give a base shield reduction of 10%, armor damage buff and the final evolutions give you an option of choosing between launching 3 missiles (with decreased force) or 1 super-dee-duper missile. Better, huh?  A good alternative to multi-frags, because it automatically fires, so you can keep firing away with your PPR/Typhoon without stopping.  Plus, you won't annoy your demolisher friends by taking all their 'nades.  Thanks to Zidijan to letting me know.


**Hunter Mode**

Available on the Geth Trooper, Hunter MOde is full of wall-haxxing and awesomeness boosting goodness.  The visual covers your screen with computer-y stuff (is hard to see icons though with it on) and turns the geth's ""eye"" into a disco light show flashing between red and blue.  With fantastic buffs and 1 downside, it is a great power.  DETAILS!!!!!!

* base 50% shield penalty on base shields
* base enhanced vision range of 15 m
* base 5% damage bonus
* base 10% accuracy bonus
* base 5% movement speed bonus

Wicked, and see through walls and cover.  Great for sniping.  The evolutions mostly vary between power buffs, either through recharge speed buffs or damage buffs, or weapon damage buffs, through accuracy or ROF buffs.  For the last evolutions, it's either enhanced vision buff (up to 24 meters!) and a movement speed buff, or an all around damage buff.  Any way you cut it, good for you.  have fun.


**Tech Armor**

You didn't think i'd forget about this, it has good activated buffs and a good de-activation power.  The visual is an orange hexagonal holographic armor.  For the de-activation:

* base damage of 400
* base force of 1000N
* base of 3 meters

For the activated parts

* base 35% DR
* base 50% power recharge speed reduction

While covering your character in a cool glowy armor (fashionable AND functional) this is the mother of all sustained abilities.  With the evolutions you can get up to 50% DR (wow), huh?  The detonation is quite helpful in staggering a pesky hunter/phantom, mopping up swarmers, and other stuff.  There's also a glitch/bug/thingy where if you're being sync-killed and you mash the Tech Armor button, it'll detonate the sync-killer and you'll be free. I haven't done it, but it has happened to my friends.  



A note about damage reduction: i talk about it a lot
Damage received = Base Damage * ((1 - Sum of Damage Reduction Bonuses) * 0.75 + 0.25)


So to take 0 damage, getting hit by 1000 points of damage, the damage received = 1000 * (1 - .50) * .75 +.25) = 625 pts of damage received.  Got it?  Good.  Thanks go to Interwebninja for explaining it to me. 


So there you have it.  The sustained powers of ME CoOp.  Hope you had fun.  TIME FOR A TEST!  just kidding.  


Any corrections/notes would be cool.


Thanks to RepShred for reminding me about the visuals.

**THE ROLES:**

**The Heavy Weapons Guy**: (*Krogan Sentinel, Turian Sentinel, any Batarian, etc.*)

""*Us against the unknown

-Wrex

This is the member of the team in charge of drawing fire away from the other members of the team so that they can do what they do best. You'll need to be tanky enough to take some fire, and abuse soft cover and gimmicks specific to your character to stay alive. The classes I've suggested all have their own form of DR, and great shield and health values, along with stagger resistance on most of them. This job is best complimented with (as the name and quote suggest) big, big guns, as CD tends not to be a huge deal with these kinds of classes, and you should take advantage of that. Shotguns work best, and the less time you spend out of cover shooting

**RECKONING UPDATE**: With the advent of the Geth Juggernaut


**The Sniper**: (*Gethfiltrator, etc.*)

""*Scoped and Dropped!*""

-Garrus

This member of the team is in charge of outputting huge DPS against single targets. HW guy should draw a good amount of fire, which he does great against. Gethfiltrator is best against Reapers or Cerberus, as their Suppressors have no shield gate, but are armored, giving him the advantage with his massive single-shot potential. The Infidrell is a good generalist, as his great weapon damage and Recon Mine is always useful, and has none of the weaknesses of the other two. Stay in the back, and eliminate threats to the rest of your team. Simple enough.

**RECKONING UPDATE**: A [Kishock Talon](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19ij2i/zaeeds_legacy_aka_how_to_make_the_talon/) is also a good choice for this slot.


**The Harrier**: (*Turian Ghost Infiltrator, Quarian Marksman, Batarian Soldier, Quarian Male Infiltrator, Shotgun Gethfiltrator, etc.*)

""*I WILL DESTROY YOU!*""

-Jack

No, and relatively light. The Harrier (gun) is a fantastic choice on this guy, as is the Valkyrie, Particle Rifle, or the Mattock or Phaeston if you don't have any of those. Other good guns include the Hurricane, Piranha, Wraith, Talon, Hunter Mode Gethfiltrators

**RECKONING UPDATE**: The AIU, shotgun damage, and general brokenness makes for a fantastic Harrier, until the nerfbat comes down hard, anyway. In addition, a Cabal Vanguard specced for weapon damage and Nightshade blades makes a good Harrier too.


**The Support**: (*Any Volus (Engy and Merc work best), Geth Engineer, etc.*)

""*Hold the line

-Kirrahe

You're in charge of keeping everyone else alive and kicking. Do that however your class of choice does best; heal and debuff if you're a Volus Engineer, so use CC and cloaks whenever necessary. CC is another job of this role; Scorpions and Falcons are the order of the day, with Arc Grenades also being great. Keep enemies at bay, and keep allies alive.


**CONCLUSION**

The regular tips still apply-- stay aware of where enemies are, since... y'know... aiming, but when pulled off right, it's just as deadly. Play to your personal strengths and the weaknesses of the factions you're up against, and you'll be fine. Have fun, and Happy Shooting.",,self,Spectre,
1358605605.0,16vjo2,Mecoop College - Equipment 407: Consumables,I_pity_the_fool,34,3,12,"I thought I'd put together some information about the various sorts of consumables (thermal clip packs

As you know

**COBRA MISSILES**.

* According to my interpretation of the variable names in coalesced.ini (found at bioweapon.ini\sfxgamempcontent\sfxweapon\heavy\consumable\rocketlauncher)
* The missiles also hit through walls.
* Since the weapon appears to have an actual damage value
* Allies, it's often a good idea to aim at the floor so that missiles don't sail off into the wild blue yonder.
* On non-objective waves
* On objective waves: with hacks on gold, say, a VIP atlas and a guardian, the next target will often be a guardian rather than an atlas.
* Remember that on objective waves, roughly the cost of a jumbo equipment pack and worth far more to you than one measly missile.
* It's a good idea to switch to your missile launcher as soon as the thought ""oh shit!"" has entered your head. Those times your team is stuck in a cycle of being killed and revived? That time your on wave 9 and pinned by two banshees? When you see three phantoms over the corpse of the guy you came to revive? All good times to use a nuke. Be careful of possessed abominations though - if you have an ability that grants a few moments of invulnerability (like stim packs or shield boost)

**OPS SURVIVAL**

* Often people use ops survival packs and complain that they were taken down moments later. While this is sometimes due to lag, atlas rocket, marauder bullet etc) which completely depletes your shields won't pass through and damage your health. After your shields blow, you get total immunity to damage for a short time - 0.5/0.25/0.1/0.01 seconds depending on your difficulty level. After this, even if your shields are restored, your shield-gate *won't* block large amounts of damage for 3 seconds. Note that froghorn is incorrect about the cooldown - it's 3 seconds, reduced from 4 in the November 14th balance changes).
* It's a good idea to remap the key for the ops pack to something you can reach in a panic (I've got mine on 'Q').
* In coalesced.ini

**MEDIGEL &amp; REVIVES**

* When you're revived
* Users on the PC often remap the medigel key to something convenient (like 'E') so that they can reload cancel - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11033675/1 - better.
* People seem to have fewer medigel than other consumables. IMO this is an indication that they (and I include myself here) should be using other consumables like ops survival packs and cobras more. It's pointless hoarding those - you're going to have to buy a jumbo equipment pack when you run out of medigel, that if you max out your weapon rail amps, ammo types and armor modules, that jumbo equipment packs start giving you nothing but ultra-rare weapons. Unless you have a desperate need for pistol rail amp Is, I suggest using your consumables. I guarantee you'll make more money that way.
* It's often fairly sensible to wait for a bit and tap the spacebar than revive instantly and hope that noone noticed your death. You don't want to run out of medigel and die just before deactivating the fourth device because you used a medigel of shame during wave 1.
* You can often cancel the 'getting up' animation with a heavy melee or a dodge. Useful if a praetorian is over your corpse.

**THERMAL CLIP PACKS**

* Thermal clip packs restore your ammo, and, according to BSN user peddroelmz's measurements, give you a 100% additive damage boost for a few seconds.
* As with other consumables

1354413275.0,144q64,Mr. Freeze (N7 Paladin),RepublicanShredder,36,7,52,"*Learn it well

**Preface**

I was thinking of call this kit The Shield ([A special cop in PAYDAY](http://payday.wikia.com/wiki/Shield)), and that's how this Paladin got its name.

**Introduction**- *Allow me to break the ice.*

So the N7 Paladin is unique in that it can create all three types of Tech Explosions all by himself. Tech Bursts are excellent against synthetics and Shields/Barriers

Instead of the usual power discussion

**Omni-Shield**- *Their bones will turn to ice! Their blood will freeze in my hands!*

Before talking about the Tech Explosions, or power (such as Energy Drain). The slowing effect of the Cryo Shield melee is very useful in my opinion, and can prime for Cryo Explosions if done right.

Which brings up an important note about the chilling effect of the Omni-Shield. If you do a light melee (just a shield bash), then shield bashing) the target will be primed for a Cryo Explosion. Cryo Shield will count as a Rank 6 primer so it will help create huge Cryo Explosions, especially with Snap Freeze.

*Edit*- Through further testing, but it's good to know. 


**Tech Burst (Energy Drain + Snap Freeze/Incinerate)**-*Let's kick some ice!* 

You will rarely make Tech Bursts all by yourself, synthetics). Also, Snap Freeze will have the Tech Burst detonate with the Paladin being the center of the Tech Burst, not the target itself.

Shields/Barriers in general shouldn't be an issue because in between a single Energy Drain and some weapons fire

**Fire Explosion (Incinerate + Energy Drain (Drain Effect)/Snap Freeze)**- *Mercy? I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy.* 

Fire Explosions will be your long range anti-Armor technique. This generally is self detonated (with Energy Drain) against the Geth, it's better to just Incinerate a target at long range and then close the distance than depend on Fire Explosions as a main source of damage. Why, you ask? Because synthetics (and sometimes organics) don't care that they are on fire, but freezing them forces them to chill out.

**Cryo Explosion (Snap Freeze + Energy Drain (Drain Effect)/Incinerate)**- *What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!*

The main attraction of the Paladin. In between Cryo Explosions' damage/radius, Cryo Explosions are the best Tech Explosion one can hope for. 

Snap Freeze has three useful properties for making mass Cryo Explosions.

The first is its ability to go through walls. Like Shockwave, Snap Freeze can damage and prime through walls. Very useful in keeping the Paladin alive by minimizing risk to himself. And at 15m, it can prime for Cryo Explosions at a distance farther than you would think. 

The second is Snap Freeze's ability to prime several targets by sweeping the freeze across the screen. This means that the Paladin can prime several targets

Finally, Armor). This makes it very easy to make Cryo Explosions any time you are within range. A lot of powers can detonate Snap Freeze, so spam it away to take advantage of massive Cryo Explosions.

On Geth, and should be the main source of damage against enemies. 

One of the great benefits of focusing on Cryo Explosions (and its chilling effects) is that enemies become much slower. If you remember from my discussion of the [Vorcha Engineer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/13bkbt/taser_taser_vorcha_hunter_engineer/)

**Weapons**- *No matter what anyone tells you

The Collector Sniper Rifle is pretty chill. It does have some weight behind it and can run out of ammo quickly

* **Extraordinary damage/ammo applicability output**- The CSR has amazing damage output and combined with rapid burst firing, another Redditor, is a big fan of the CSR and the person who showed me how amazing that gun is.

* **Unlimited ammo, you no longer depend on ammo boxes. I think that's pretty cool.

If you are in the market for something with much less weight

**Conclusion**- *You're not sending ME to the COOLER!*

Don't neglect the N7 Paladin. He is multifaceted and can mix with any team (even Biotics as Snap Freeze is very effective to slow enemies to be caught by a Biotic Explosion). You may want to skip the nice ice puns

And that is why you should play as an N7 Paladin. He is a true Sentinel in terms of both tankiness (Omni-Shield) and being multifaceted (all types of Tech powers and Explosions). Easily one of the best characters up there with the Turian Ghost

Holy crap.  This thing does incredible damage, and both the burst and sustained DPS are roughly equivalent to a Mattock X.  I don't know why this didn't occur to me earlier, as the two guns have exactly the same damage per level now (although the Harrier's fire rate is ~20% higher).  The semi-auto fire is probably annoying to some, but it also reduces the problem of overkill and wasted ammo.  I don't need to run to ammo boxes nearly as often with a Mattock.  With the human engineer with a Power Efficiency Module II/III, the timing on reloads syncs well with the magazine size of the Mattock.  When I'm firing at boss enemies, I can unload a full clip, start to reload, who don't have the benefit of the easier PC reload cancel).

I know this isn't exactly news to much of this subreddit, it's lightish, and it ranks among the top few weapons in the game for DPS.  Buy those Veteran Packs and max this thing out.

Also, and does about 25% more DPS at the expense of accuracy and recoil (assuming a smart choke / shredder for Piranha and extended barrel / piercing mod for Mattock)).

Finally, they continue to be my favorite class of gun.

We had 3 GI and 1 QI, 3 melee GI are enough to dissolve a prime in 1 to 2 seconds. 

And that's all you need to do: 

* set it to geth gold, glacier is the best imo, pick at least 3 melee build GI. 
* learn from aut0mati0n's [guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s7jir/the_glass_cannon_aka_pure_melee_geth_infiltrator/). Let me elaborate a bit here - proper step: turn on hunter mode, heavy melee, and enjoy 2-3 lines of melee kill updates
* DISSOLVE EVERYTHING. It's almost like a mobile missile tank. Go at the prime together and it'd would go down in seconds. 

Tips: 

- bring light weapons to max cool down

- better not do it on cerberus or reapers (could work but risky and takes longer time)

- kill them in groups

p.s. no shooting skill required

**Sniper Rifles**

1. If you're in Infiltrator, Rocket Troopers, etc) with the tac-cloak damage bonus. The Widow is generally superior against large high armor targets while the Mantis beats it out against infantry. The Black Widow is nice but loses a lot of potential damage because the third shot in the clip generally cannot be fired fast enough to get the damage bonus from Tac-cloak. The Valiant is a worthy alternative if you lack a high level Widow or Mantis because, unlike the Black Widow, you can get all three shots off within the span of your tactical cloak damage bonus.

2. Non Infiltrator classes that do not spam powers will prefer the Black Widow for its higher potential damage per clip and the ability to engage three enemies per thermal clip instead of one.

3. Power spamming classes would generally be better suited without a sniper

**Assault Rifles**

In my personal opinion all the options currently are rather lacking. The main issue with them is that although they may have high DPS, there are still several effective choices if you so desire.



1. The Mattock is a good choice in almost any situation because of its high damage per shot and good accuracy. However, consider the Mattock a heavier pistol.

2. The Avenger is generally the best traditional assault rifle. It's insanely lightweight

3. The Falcon, but rather area of effect suppression. Using the Falcon you can effectively lock down entire spawns or chokes, constantly staggering any enemies who try to move through. The slow rate of fire means that it's not as effective in this role as it once was (enemies have a brief moment of movement between shots now), but it's still leagues ahead of any other weapon in this regard. (Thanks to Runescrye for reminding me this had been rebuffed).

4. The Revenant, but they do minimize it. With the recent damage buffs this weapon actually outperforms the Avenger during Marksmanship.

**SMGs**

Much like assault rifles, pick up an Avenger (it's actually lighter than most SMGs). If you're looking for close range, pick up a shotgun. Still, there are several niches which SMGs fit in passably.

1. The Shuriken is effective at stripping shields at any range if you lack other options. While it is technically burstfire

2. The Hornet actually provides huge burst damage if you can deal with the recoil. While it might seem counter intuitive

**Shotguns**

1. The Graal Spike thrower is an amazing weapon. You can fire from the hip and use it as a traditional shotgun but the true strength of this weapon lies in the amazing accuracy it has while aiming. The spread of this gun is actually pinpoint when you aim down the sights

2. Similarly, treat it like a heavy pistol.

3. The Katana is probably the best traditional shotgun, a large clip, and is relatively low on weight.

**Heavy Pistols**

1. The Carnifex is simply a beast. It's probably got one of the best weight to damage ratios in the game, chances are you'll be best suited by a Carnifex X and nothing else. Just make sure to always aim for the head and keep in mind that the low thermal clip size combined with a low backup ammunition count means you're going to have to make frequent ammo runs.

2. The Phalanx is your best bet if you either don't have a Carnifex X (lower ranks don't give 200% cooldown reduction, and a good balance of medium damage per shot and high refire rate. It's an exceptional sidearm if you already have a main weapon with a high weight and don't want to add onto that with a Carnifex. ",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,True,PC,

1333121045.0,rl0hy,my Drell Adept build and some advice,fdelys,36,8,38,"Strength Punishes; Speed Kills.

Take this for what it's worth.  I play mostly Drell Adept

Spec Reave for damage reduction/ radius.  
Spec cluster grenades as you will
Definitely max out Fitness.  Shields/movement speed.
I put 5 points in Assassin

My whole theory with the Drell Adept is that the developers gave you crap shields and a speed boost to indicate that you have to play a certain way to be successful.  And that style is hit and run.  Hit and run.  Remember that.

Reave everything everywhere all. the. time.  Ideally, but don't neglect them- they are uber powerful and blow up Reave.  
Some example cluster grenade usages: use them in a small room; use them on a tough enemy; blanket a friend's corpse with them

Keep in mind that Reave knocks back all enemies except for the big baddies.  You probably want something accurate that gives you 200% cooldown.  Cast reave on an enemy or enemies, phalanx, or avenger (or something similar).  If it's dicey, you can reave an enemy in the face (which stuns them) and peace out of there at Mach Drell 5.  You can also use this speed to run all the way across a map for an objective.  You're like a poor man's infiltrator for objectives.  Not as good, but still quite adequate in most situations.

You can be a rocket assassin when it's eliminate the targets time.  If they're normal, rush out.  You'll kill lots of shit.  If they're tough, rush in and rocket the room.  

I can't imagine how Drell Adepts cope without the speed- use it and use it well.  I play on Gold all the time with this class.  Good luck!

Edit: Added the first line.

Edit: I forgot to mention that there are three good ways to deal with shielded enemies.  
First: set down Reave and have your sentinel/adept friend blow it up.  
Second: Hit them with Reave and then while they're stunned shoot their shield off- this actually works quite well.  Infiltrators who use energy drain and then get a head shot on the stunned enemy will be quite familiar with this tactic.

**Quarian (Class B)** *Rank: Red*

The second category of quarian hostiles carry an omni-tool with only two programs running on it, has been covered already. Fiery projectiles that have devastating effects if it's not expected. The second program is, in itself, one that does not directly damage enemy soldiers, but leaves them extremely vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

'Tactical Scan' has been written by quarian operatives to highlight certain targets on the field. When running, shield power, barrier reserves as well as allowing them to see the target through obstacles such as walls. Tactical Scan also sends out a small electrical charge combined with a minor hacking VI, which seizes up and decreases the effectiveness of Cerberus appointed armour systems, both standard-issue and reinforced Armour. If a quarian Class-B Engineer is spotted in combat, take note if suddenly all four hostiles focus fire on one target. Use this to either stay in cover or move in and flank depending on the situation.

These quarians are also trained in grenade use, unlike most grenades, which means that it detonates immediately when impacting the ground, giving Cerberus troops zero time to react to the bomb. Testing our prototype Mark-II Cerberus Fragmentation Grenades using this pressure-sensitive system have resulted in failure for unknown reasons. When the Arc Grenade detonates, miniscule conductive pellets are released at high speed from the explosion. These pellets are not enough to penetrate standard combat protective gear, however this is not the intention of the Arc Grenade. The central sphere inside is extremely ionized, and, arcs this electrical difference into the conductive pellets now imbedded into hostile's armour. The resulting discharge sends enough electricity into enemies within the detonation radius to short out shield generators

Like the quarian Class-A Engineer, whether they stop the conductive pellets or dissipate the electrical difference has not been determined, so be wary upon approach. A startled quarian Class-B Engineer has been known to drop an Arc Grenade at its feet and flee in the chaos.

**Human (Class-B)** *Rank: Red*

Another division of the Interplanetary Combatives Academy in Rio de Janeiro, the human Class-B Engineer is a walking destructive force on the battleground. An explosives expert, this Engineer is a one person demolition squad. Often times, Cerberus operatives bunkered down in local domiciles and constructions have been eliminated by the class-B human Engineer bringing the entire building down to the ground.

This Interplanetary Combatives Academy truly lives up to its name by accepting aliens as valid instructors and tacticians. Quarian technicians have relinquished the Arc Grenade schematic to the Academy, but time is on our side. Human Class-B Engineers have carried the Arc Grenades into battle alongside their quarian allies, and used them just as effectively.

Using the Fragmentation Grenade popularized by the various Human Soldiers, and is fired, from the omni-tool, and also relies on the information given by the Hostile Identification and Tracking System Implant to seek and destroy specific targets. Depending on each Engineer, these grenades can carry an incendiary payload, armour-penetrating shrapnel or the ability to split into two separate grenades to explode on two targets simultaneously.

As previous skirmishes and training drills have shown, wait until they're out, and then move in for the kill. Unfortunately, the Engineer can deploy a All-Terrain Expandable Fabrication Mechanism, shortened to 'Supply Pylon'. Seemingly diverged from the initial pylon design that our Cerberus Mass Accelerator Equipped Armoured Turret started from, the Supply Pylon gives the Engineer an apparently never-ending stock of grenades to throw. Exactly how many grenades can be manufactured is unknown, but it has been found to be more than enough to wipe out a platoon before packing up and moving. 

An additional leg of the Cerberus Advanced-Training Obstacle Course has been added to counteract this specialized demolition expert. In order to move and flank, but simply overwhelm them into submission.

**Volus** *Rank:Red*

Biotic-lacking volus tend to, however. They are a smaller target, can recharge their shield on a whim with Shield Boost, and are often underestimated by their opponents.

The volus Engineer seems to have taken a page from the human Class-B Engineer's book, are mechanically complex enough for omni-tools to manage only 1 of each on the field at a time. 

Proximity Mine is a basic mine, or to deteriorate the armour itself, rendering following attacks and gunfire more effective. Rookie Cerberus troopers are reminded to always be aware on the battlefield in order to avoid these deathtraps.

The Recon Mine has been deployed by the volus Engineers since before the Reaper Wars began, focuses less on sudden, unexpected detonations but instead is used as an extremely useful tool to monitor the battlefield from a safe location. A few seconds after deployment, the Recon Mine sends out a penetrating laser field that operates much like the quarian Class-B Engineer's Tactical Scan. Enemies in this field are painted red in the volus' and his allies' optics through obstacles. The laser itself can be tweaked to either affect protective combat gear enough to limit mobility as well as the protection it offers. This mine, instead of automatically being triggered, is manually set off by the volus Engineer's omni-tool and this explosion has a very large radius and can be directed to penetrate hardened Armour.

The volus Engineer relies on disabling his adversaries, never assume you can catch one unprepared, it has probably tracked you from the moment your boots touched the ground.

**Turian** *Rank: Red*

In turian society, among other things. These turians, now ready for frontline combat, have not had the time to develop their own devices or programs to introduce to the fight, but instead master their allies' tactics and compliment them with their rigid and extensive skills learned from the turian military. 

From the quarians, minor pulse cannon, armour-penetrating or possible cryo ammunition, and short-range electrical discharge. This distracting device allows the turian to focus on basic military precise gunfire to take down its enemies.

From the humans

Finally, the Sabotage program sneaks past most firewalls, ours included, and recalibrates the Friend Or Foe target detection system in our tech devices. Too many talented Combat Engineers have been killed with the very Turrets they have deployed. This also has an overloading effect on small, handheld weapons, and, if the Engineer changes the program a certain way

Turian Engineers are solid combatants that can take as much as they give. Even the slow and steady advance of a phalanx of Guardians is not enough to break a turian's concentration in the midst of a shootout. Their last shot is just as steady and deadly as their first. An old saying says that the only way to see a turian's back is if they're dead. We at Cerberus view it the other way around. The only way to kill a turian is to see its back. Flanking and suppressive fire

**Vorcha** *Rank: Red*

The vorcha have flown under Cerberus' radar for far too long. Them siding with the Alliance has shown how far Earth's military have fallen. The rats of Omega now fight with humans. Extremely aggressive and short-lived

Surprisingly, Incinerate, coinciding with the species' tendencies to use flame and fire on the battlefield.

Somehow, launched from the vorcha's omni-tool, snare and subdue targets in the electrically charged strands. It is a relatively slow projectile, easily dodged by a combat roll, but even if only grazed by the web can cause the entire Submission Net to wrap around the victim. Cerberus operatives are advised to be aware when a vorcha Engineer is present, as the Submission Net can also be placed on a wall or floor by itself, waiting to entrap the first person to trigger the threads. 

The vorcha, specifically tailored to a vorcha's biology, these cells' mitochondria have been granted a higher ability to process fuel into energy and have managed to increase the vorcha's speed of healing into seconds. If the vorcha breathes, it will come back and kill you. Give the vorcha no quarter, and put them down like vermin. Once brought low, use the neck-stomp execution taught in Cerberus Basic Training to end this manic monster once and for all.",[Story Time],self,Xbox,

1371455782.0,1gi63w,Phasic Ammo Discussion,InterwebNinja,32,3,31,"###Introduction

I'd like to talk about Phasic Rounds.  Everyone knows you use Phasic Rounds with single-shot snipers to deal with shield gate (see my post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/) for more info on shield gate).  What I don't think as many people realize is how good Phasic Ammo can be on many other setups.  This discussion is rather in-depth

For the sake of this discussion, Phasic Ammo III does 15% bonus damage, with 10x damage against shields / barriers.  So, against those defenses, it gets a 150% bonus.  This damage bonus is applied to the *base* damage of the weapon you are using, so all of the equipment / passives, etc. are not counted towards the ammo damage bonus.  Note, that the TC multiplicative bonus is still applied to ammo

###Thesis

The general principle of what makes Phasic Ammo so good (with the right builds) is this:  a high percentage of the defenses you apply weapons damage to during a match are either shields or barriers

That may sound obvious or dubious, hypothetically, you aren't using any powers in a match, and you're just firing your weapon.  Let's also assume that 50% of the defenses in the match are shields / barriers, and the remaining half is split 50/50 between health / armor.  In that scenario, you'd be getting a 150% bonus half of the time, and an effective 7.5% bonus the other half.  So total bonus is `150% * 0.5 + 7.5% * 0.5 = 80%`.  Compare that to Warp IV, and Phasic stacks up quite favorably.

Now, of course you aren't *just* firing your weapon in a match; lots of classes have powers that strip shields, and biotics are better off with Warp Ammo.'  That is all true, but I'm not talking about using this with shield-stripping or biotic classes.  I'm more focused on weapons-based classes like Soldiers and Infiltrators.  Given that's the case, let's just look at an example to suss out how big of a difference it actually makes.

I'm assuming in the example below that, as it makes the difference a little more obvious because it allows for one-hit kills on many more enemies.

##[Turian Havoc Example](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/TurianHavoc/RAPNR/GraalSpike10AO5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3///)

This is actually the first build I noticed in-game how much of a benefit Phasic Ammo can have (mostly because I was out of all my other Ammo at the time).  On this build, it does an additional `1.5 * 1320 = 1920` damage for a total of 4422.  Compare that to Warp IV, which does ~~0.6 * 1320 + 2442 = 3234 against shields~~ no extra damage against shields, and `1.2 * 1320 + 2442 = 4026` against barriers.  Against health, Phasic does an additional 198 damage and Warp IV does 792.

Thus, Engineers, Hunters, and Geth Bombers, whereas Warp IV can not.  Compared to Warp III, Phasic III will additionally be able to one-shot kill Nemeses, Marauders

Phasic does not get a damage bonus against armor, Phasic rounds come out quite well.  Against a boss like a Gold Atlas, Phasic III will take 14 shots to kill, and Warp III / IV will take 17.  Against a Gold Banshee, Phasic III takes 9 shots, Warp IV takes 8, and Warp III takes 9.

Against purely armored enemies like Brutes, it would take about 30% longer to kill a Brute With Phasic III than with Warp IV.  Compared to Warp III, it would only take about 18% longer to kill.

###Further Discussion

I am sure you are thinking that this hinges on quite a few assumptions, if you're playing with a shield-stripping power like Overload, using Phasic isn't going to do much for you.  And on a biotic class, Warp Ammo is usually the best choice.  In addition, you probably have teammates that are also firing at enemies, and they may have shield-stripping powers, or weapons like the Reegar or Talon which quickly eradicate shields.  So, then Phasic Ammo is going to have less relative value.

But... if you play somewhat independently or your teammates just aren't that powerful, Phasic III does roughly 30% more effective damage than Warp IV against shielded enemies, and roughly 50% more than Warp III.

###Other Observations

* Phasic is going to be most effective against Cerberus / Geth

* One nice feature of Phasic ammo is that it delays the recharge on enemies' shields / barriers.  That is particularly nice for dealing with enemies like Banshees

* Stripping the shields of most enemies will stagger them

* The more weapons damage bonuses your build has

* Phasic Ammo may not be feasible on a lot of builds that need to use an ammo with AP ability to maximize damage.  Weapons like the PPR come to mind.

* Phasic is less likely to be helfpul at lower difficulties where a lower proportion of enemies have shields / barriers.  But then again

* For the average Gold+ lower-tier enemy with shields, Phasic will do better when they have more than 50% barriers remaining.  This somewhat mitigates the problem of teams applying damage to enemies before you can take advantage of your Phasic ammo.

###Conclusion

I'm not arguing you should put Phasic Ammo on all (or even most) of your classes, and for the most part, Phasic Ammo has come out favorably.  Phasic isn't the right ammo all the time, but given the right circumstances, it can be a comparable, or an even superior alternative.  And, if you're short on your other III-IV Warp, or AP and have built up a stockpile of Phasic III

This isn't theorycrafting.  Through gameplay, but those are often the best times to use it - you don't need any AP benefit from AP or Warp ammo, and Phasic isn't just about bypassing shield gate.  It simply does more effective damage against many lower-tier enemies.

Give it a try against Geth with the Havoc or the Human Infiltrator

Anyway, etc. builds, and I think it has a lot more utility than that.

**ALRIGHT, CREATING A ASS-KICKING-DOMINO EFFECT.**

The Krogan Warlord plays like no other class. You've got limited mobility, you can't take cover. You also can't dodge or slide over cover as a result (but you can sprint), which makes some maps tricky to navigate due to large amounts of cover. If you're going to use any armor equipment, *use an Adrenaline Module*. 

On the bright side, and the Krogan Warlord is a sponge **(MY SKILL WITH METAPHORS IS UNMATCHED).** 

When you kill an enemy with a melee attack, you're going to be very difficult to kill.

**THE WARLORD IS BUILT EXCLUSIVELY FOR A MELEE-FOCUSED PLAYSTYLE

Now that we've clarified that you should have the primal urge to smash things into Cerberus/Geth/Reaper/Collector-sized bits, you'll be taking very little damage while using melee. Another unique thing about the Krogan Warlord is his selection of possible melee attacks- 4, to be exact:

* Standing still, embrace, attack, comfort, and put-down, it only makes sense that your most basic attack is this Krogan sign of (dis)approval. With this attack, you can kill most mooks in one to two hits. If that didn't do the job, the final swing from your hammer should put them down for good

**EDIT:** A fun sidenote: the third swing detonates your current charge, ""HOME RUN!""

* Standing still, quickly slam it into the ground (it's about as long as your average heavy melee), and put it back where it was beforehand. If you're using a charge (see below), you're going to expend one of those charges. Oh right, and it's incredibly powerful, able to tear *chunks* of armor off of bosses. You can still be grabbed or insta-killed by bosses, so watch out. You should have no issue tearing a Geth Prime or Atlas Mech to shreds

* Moving, and you can still do the three-hit combo with it.

* Storming, most enemies will die instantly, while you may want to follow up with a couple shots from your gun, or a light melee.

**A TRUE WARLORD'S SIDEARM IS HIS PRIMARY WEAPON.**

If you want to try a gun-focused Sentinel, or pose a threat in numbers. Bosses can be taken down with melee, but you're going to want something meaty to tear chunks out of enemies. Because your skills allow you to reduce a shotgun's weight by a large margin, a weapon like the Venom (the charged shot drops 3 grenades, which are very handy for getting behind a Guardian) or the Claymore (for punching through armor from a distance) are very good choices. 

Even if you don't want a shotgun, and no matter what gun you're using, *always use the blade attachment*. That extra melee damage will go miles towards helping you deal with enemies.

**YOUR SKILLS SHOULD REFLECT BEING ABLE TO CRUSH

This means Tech Armor is a must, as your Tech Armor can be detonated to set enemies up for a Tech Explosion. The Electric Hammer wraps it up nicely.

You should already know how to spec Tech Armor for the Warlord (whatever you can use to get maximum melee damage), take your pick). Keep Tech Armor up at all times, unless you're dealing with someone who is giving you enough trouble that you just want to hit them with the hardest hammer slam you can.

~~*Only choose one hammer type*~~. Using both hammers is a viable strategy. It's recommended that you forgo the Krogan Warlord tree if you do. If you want to take down armored foes, with a long cooldown awaiting you. As a result, you should always use this power when you're not in battle, so you can charge it again in cover during a firefight. 

**EDIT:** You can cancel the animation for charging your hammer if you immediately perform a Heavy Melee attack after the ""charge circles"" appear on the weapon. Another thing to note is that you can recharge at any time

**ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE ON HAMMER CHARGES:** When using a charge, of course, but it's nice to have a little power damage boost. You can make an incredible Electric Hammer with high power damage.

The Electric hammer can focus on a large amount of enemies, and you're going to want to deal the maximum amount of damage. As odd as it sounds, you're not going to want the Electric/Cryo Hammer, as you're not going to be able to melee each enemy quickly, and your gun isn't the focus here. Electric/Fire should deal enough damage to finish enemies, and a simple headbutt should keep them down for the count.

Speccing in Krogan Warlord is easy: you have no powers to benefit using a gun, and shotguns.

Warlord Rage is the tree that lets you decide: do you want to deal even more damage than usual, or deal crazy amounts of hammer damage. *Either way, you should spec into Martial arts, as your regenerating health makes your shields an afterthought.*

**CLOSING WORDS ARE FOR WEAKLINGS.**

I'm still going to use them

**Tech Armor:** Damage, power), Durability.

**Electric Hammer:** Shields, but you should always load charges when your powers are ready).

**Krogan Warlord:** Capacity

**Warlord Rage:** Melee, Martial Artist, and Pure Rage also works nicely).

**EDIT: IMPORTANT SIDENOTE!**

After some testing, a 6/6/6/0/6 tree, or even 3 points in Krogan Warlord and 5 in another are a very good strategy. The Disciple is also very useful.

**EDIT: [BUILD ON CHARACTER CREATOR!](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/KroganWarlord/RMKAP/Disciple10AN5AO5//StrengthEnhancer3/AdrenalineModule4/JuggernautShield5/)** 

Note: Suggested build in the character creator contains very high level equipment even I do not have (or use). Adrenaline Module at II or III is just fine

The Warlord is a complex class that is very versatile. You can go melee or tank, detonate your enemy's faces (that's a joke relative to the force of your hamm- ah, forget it), or a combination of both.

1361907074.0,199xts,The Turian Cabal: Invictus' Queen Cobra,fwhooooooomp,32,6,43,"**Historical Background**

The Turian Colony Invictus has always lived true to it's Latin nomenclature; it's tropical belt has been unconquered by the planets foreign inhabitants and rife with virulence and chaos. Of course, it only makes sense that the Hierarchy would find a brutal new fighting force to strike back against the Reapers on this very Planet.

From within the Lush Jungle which claimed so many colonists and has been avoided for generations now sprang forth a group of Turians unlike any that had been seen prior. A remnant of the Unification war over two thousand years ago, fled the Hierarchy and landed on then uncharted Invictus. They nearly died on that planet like many Colonists later would, but instead of fleeing or avoiding the jungle, they embraced it and adapted. Of the some 5000 Turian refugees that landed there, only 1000 lived into the next generation, but surprisingly, a rare genetic marker in the survivors left 900 of those being females. This caused a truly remarkable shift in the new Turian Culture that formed on Invictus. Females, began safeguarding them for reproduction and became the most agile and adept at fighting for survival in the wilderness. These females became masters of the local toxicology employed by local predators and the best amplified their biotics by selectively breeding with only other Turian biotics in the group.

*Poison Strike*: SKIP IT!

That's right no charge on this Vanguard

1.  It doesn't refill your barriers like charge so the risk reward isn't equal like charge. 

2. The power doesn't lock on

I love the idea of it

*Nightshade Blades*: ALL the way 

1. Rank 4A Damage over Capacity. With Grenade Gear you'll definitely want that extra 30% damage on top of it's already crazy base damage. That also increases the DoT which has helped me take down phantoms so far. If the capacity was an increase by two

2. Rank 5B Poison Duration over Range. This was the toughest choice for me as range, this is a grenade based power which I can fire off quickly if I need more damage. The duration will help paralyze organics longer so they die from DoT and don't shoot you. 

3. Rank 6A Enhanced Blades over Exploding blades. The Enhanced Blades combined with the passive combination I'm going to take later brings the upfront damage to nearly 3000, does less over all damage and I wont need the stagger as the Venom will take care of that.

*Biotic Focus*: All the way for the panic button 

1. Rank 4A Damage Taken over Movement Speed. The total decrease in damage taken in Biotic Focus will be -25%. That's significant and will allow you take take a hit better than most soldiers when combined with fitness. Also

2. Rank 5A Duration over Melee Damage. If something gets close to you, and it will be dead or crying. With this Weapons platform style you wont need to be using melee very often unless you're finishing someone off with style (it is very stylish). Duration on the other hand lets you stay in your enhanced state longer so you aren't fussing with it instead of shooting or blading. 

3. Rank 6A Biotic Shield over Heighten focus. This was a tough decision as this is a very balanced Rank 6 Choice. I ultimately went with the Shield for that invulnerability which can allow you to tank Atlas rockets and Banshee warp balls while instantly starting some barrier regeneration. Also the bottom evolution would be better for a melee build

**Passives and Fitness**

The Cabal was blessed with the Base Turian passives which make for the crux of this build. She can wield the unwieldy. 

1. I went 4A Damage and Stability to boost your Hurricane and  

2. Next I chose Rank 5B headshots. It is definitely useful for the Blood Pack Punisher as nothing feels more satisfying than an armor piercing slug to the head.... if you're firing it. 

3. To make landing those headshots easier and to add that extra punch I went Damage and stability as weight isn't much of a factor since I'm not poison striking and Blades are grenade based with her.

*Fitness*: This ain't no melee build! Health and shields all the way! You want to tank for crappy bugs all day right?

**Weapons and Gear**

1. To stick with the theme

2. Along with that you should bring the Hurricane for single target DPS which She can fully take advantage of with her passives. The power amplifier

3. Shock Trooper or grenade Gear will allow you to use the Blades with impunity. You aren't fragile and are considerably mobile so you don't need any other gear but Adrenaline modules,[Build],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1362192987.0,,True
1361696531.0,194k9r,ME3 Co-Op College 604: Grenades,RepublicanShredder,36,6,33,"In this installment of the ME3 Co-Op College, grenades are a powerful and disposable tool in any operative's arsenal. While in ME1 they were discs that can be upgraded to include different effects, some are great in 
dislodging enemies from cover

Grenades are powers and as such benefit from power damage upgrades in the passive upgrades. Grenades also don't depend on power cooldown and instead depend on grenade capacity to be used. This means that you can use grenades in Tactical Cloak without breaking it

All grenades (sans Inferno Grenades) can detonate Power Combos of some form. The center of these detonations (such as an Arc Grenade detonating a Fire Explosion) is centered around the location of the grenade detonation

On the downside grenade explosions also cause screen shake

Which brings up the topic of grenade capacity. Grenade capacity determines how many grenades you can carry through battle. 
Speccing one point (Rank 1) into a grenade will grant 1 grenade, Stim, Arc) or two (Frag, Multi-Frag, Sticky, Inferno, Cluster
addition, and Shock Trooper Upgrade gear can also add extra grenade capacity. Finally, the N7 Demolisher (a grenade specialist) has her passive granting her additional grenade capacity. 

There are two ways to ""recharge"" grenades. The first is grabbing grenades (small grey/black cans) in an ammo box or Supply Pylon. Most ammo boxes should give two grenades per box but a few of the older maps (Dagger, Reactor | Hazard variants should grant two grenades per box) still only grant one grenade per box. On Bronze, each grenade in a box/Pylon counts as two towards your grenade capacity instead of the normal one grenade in box to one grenade to capacity on the other difficulties. The second method is using a Thermal Clip Pack consumable to restore up to 10 grenades. Using a Thermal Clip Pack will not restore beyond the 10 grenade limit (only an issue on a Demolisher maxing out grenade capacity).

When it comes to upgrades

**Grenade Type (Users) (Type of power)**

Description of the grenade and how it works

Interesting Evolutions of note

My note on how the grenade works
_________________________________________


**Frag Grenades (Human Soldier/BF3 Soldier) (Combat)**

Frag Grenade sends a high explosive fragmentation grenade that bounces around before detonating. This power also detonates upon contact of enemy. It possesses a flat long arc and thus easy to aim. Frag Grenades have a base force of 1500N. Frag Grenades set the operating precedent for many other grenades

Frag Grenades can be evolved to deal bleed damage to organics (a la Shredder evolution for Concussive Shot) at Rank 5 and can be given a Shield/Armor damage modifier at Rank 6. Unfortunately the rank 6 evos are bugged to deal 1.5x damage

Overall a balanced grenade and has no particular weakness. In particular
radius. Bouncing off of walls is an excellent technique to send the grenade beyond LoS and can save your squad in times of need. 

________________________________________

**Multi-Frag Grenades (N7 Destroyer Soldier) (Combat)**

Multi-Frag Grenades send three miniature frag grenades out of the hand. They start out clustered together and split apart as they go farther they travel. Unlike Frag Grenades

Half of the evolutions add damage/force to each miniature frag grenade. At Rank 6
added per use. It should be noted that on the power screen the damage/radius/force is for each miniature grenade.

Mutli-Frag Grenades can easily stagger bosses
they are the best source of instant CC on the N7 Destroyer. 
_______________________________________

**Inferno Grenades (Krogan Solider/Batarian Soldier) (Combat)**

Inferno Grenades send a heavy arcing

Inferno Grenades can be specced for either crowd control with radius upgrades or nuking with higher DoT output. At Rank 6 Inferno Grenades can launch an additional fragment to set more enemies on fire or be evolved to deal additional damage to armor.

Inferno Grenades can either be geared towards hitting a swath of enemies with a large radius (9m) or geared towards Armor nuking that can waste bosses and spawns alike (~1044 damage/second vs Armor with a properly specced and equipped Krogan Soldier).

______________________________

**Sticky Grenades (Human Infiltrator/Quarian Female Infiltrator) (Combat)**

Sticky Grenades are a high explosive grenade that sticks upon landing. it detonates shortly after sticking to something  Has high 
base damage and a small radius with a base force of 1500N. [Sticky Grenades can take on ammo properties that self-explode
self-explosion damage based on weapon damage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146wbn/unnecessarily_long_guide_sticky_fiery_boomboom_qfi/)

Has a 1.5x Armor damage modifier evolution at Rank 5 that can rival Inferno Grenades in the Armor damage department (5197 vs Armor per grenade with appropriate equipment and evolutions on a QFI). It also has a unique Proximity Mine evolution at Rank 6

Like Inferno Grenades
cutting off routes with Proximity Mine Sticky Grenades. 

________________________________

**Arc Grenades (Quarian Male Engineer/Quarian Male Infiltrator/N7 Demolisher Engineer) (Tech)**

Arc Grenades are essentially Overload in a grenade. It sends out a large electrical burst upon impact, while the N7 Demolisher has 6m. Possesses a base force of 1000N.

Arc Grenades can be evolved to deal bleed damage at Rank 5 vs all targets and can evolve a 1.75x shields/armor modifier at Rank 6. 

Arc Grenades are an excellent form crowd control with large radius. Arc Grenades are also great for Bronze killstreaks by 
themselves on spawns and shield stripping with shield modifier evo. Combining Arc and Inferno Grenades on a spawn can result in 
some killstreaks with proper placement. 

_____________

**Homing Grenade (N7 Demolisher Engineer/Turian Sabotuer Engineer/Drell Infiltrator) (Tech)**

Using a Homing Grenade launches a homing projectile out of the omnitool. This projectile is launched at an angle while only curving when locked on and detonates upon impact. Like 
Sticky Grenades

Homing Grenades can be evolved to add a fire DoT effect ~~that can prime for Fire Explosions at Rank 5~~ (it does NOT prime for Fire Explosions unfortunately). They can also be given an 
Armor damage modifier at Rank 6
powers/ammo. Also at Rank 6 is the ability to evolve Homing Grenades to split into two smaller grenade that do 60% damage of the original grenade each . The Split Grenades attack in a similar manner to Double Throw from the single-player


Homing Grenades are a decent grenade for single target use when specced for pure damage and alright at dealing with mooks when evolved into Split Grenades. They require some finesse before getting best results as the arc can cause the grenade to hit the ceiling when indoors. Despite being a Tech power
Vulnerability from Sabotage. 

_________________

**Cluster Grenades (Drell Adept/Drell Vanguard/Vorcha Sentinel/Batarian Slasher Adept) (Biotic)**

Using Cluster Grenades will throw 2 biotically charged fragments that carry decent damage and significant force behind them. 
Cluster Grenades can detonate any Power Combo if the target is primed for one (FE, CE) and have a 1.5x modifier against 
Barriers. Cluster Grenades in cover tend to start out clumped together while out of cover they start out more apart. The damage 
and force on the power screen is for each fragment.

Cluster Grenades can be evolved for additional damage and force (can break 2000N per fragment). They can also gain the ability to deal extra additive damage on top of biotically primed (e.g. targets affect by Reave) targets a la Warp Ammo at Rank 5. Finally

Cluster Grenades are a strong grenade and a great suppressor in times of need. The ability to send a large amount of damage 
through grenades and Power Combos in an area at once makes it a solid grenade in any situation. They can really screw aiming 
more-so than other grenades due to number of fragments and force.

_______________________

**Lift Grenades (Asari Vanguard/Krogan Sentinel) (Biotic)**

Using a Lift Grenade will throw a single biotically infused grenade that unleashes a shockwave upon detonating. The shockwave will lift one Health-only target

Lift Grenades can be evolved to increase lift time at Rank 5 and slam targets after lifting takes place at Rank 6. The Slam 
evolution stuns the target on the ground for three seconds after the lift time takes place. This slam can also cause crazy physics.

The lifting aspect of this grenade rarely comes into play given how many enemies die when hit by a lift grenade when at health. 
Given how Slam sends targets down with force
similar manner to how targets bounce off of walls when hit by Throw. Lift Grenades can also can explode power combos on Health-
only enemies but given the power of the grenade it usually is redundant to make the target explode. My advice is to use this 
grenade as a biotic version of Frag Grenades

___________________________________

**Stimulant Packs (Turian Ghost Infiltrator/Turian Havoc Soldier) (Combat)**

Using a Stim Pack will recharge and boost max shields like a Survival Ops Kit and gives a damage boost upon use that lasts 6 
seconds. Like throwing grenades
for the time it is in use. Using Stim Packs blurs the edge of the screen when in use.

Stim Packs can be evolved to add additional shields or more damage when active. They can also be evolved to increase the time in 
max shields mode instead of extra capacity at Rank 5. 

Stim Packs are useful for surviving as they rapidly restore shields
the boost. This leaves you with no immediate shields and one less Stim Pack. Use Stim Packs preemptively before a big engagement to get the best benefits and to avoid said issue.

1360249000.0,182ehk,Mecoop College 609: Powers: Drones and Turrets and Decoys,I_pity_the_fool,31,2,29,"I've decided that we should probably look at all the pet powers together. They share one or two things in common and it's worth having their details all in one place for comparison. I'll assume you're aware of the very basics of each power

##Power Combinations

I think one of the reasons that pets aren't seen as very useful on gold and platinum is that their damage doesn't scale well. While the damage of biotic explosions scales with difficulty - and therefore with enemy health - the straight damage of powers doesn't

The sentry turret and geth turret's flamethrowers *set up* fire explosions. Detonating them is tricky for the quarian engineer and turian saboteur. You need, and sabotage, afaict, either doesn't detonate tech combos or does it when the enemy's guns backfire - that is, 1.5 seconds after they're hit with the power. This does not make for reliable fire explosions.

The geth engineer on the other hand has no such trouble. He has the best detonating power in the game - overload. It travels instantly

The exploding decoy and exploding drone both set *off* tech combos. Notably

Remember that if you put 6 ranks into your drone, detonation) is at an earlier rank (say, rank 4).

##Sentry Turret

If you *really* want to know how the sentry turret operates

Key points:

* The turret chooses between shock
* All the turret's attacks get boosts from power damage bonuses
* The gun can score headshots occasionally
* If you choose the AP perk on the gun

It appears that each of the turret's attacks has a cooldown

The coalesced file has some interesting details about each of the attacks the sentry turret uses. I've updated these with what we know from the balance changes.

**The Gun**

Base damage = 75

Rate of fire: 540

(roundsperburst = 1

ai_burstfirecount = 3

ai_burstfiredelay = 2

ai_aimdelay = 1 (presumably the turret has a little difficulty switching to a new target)

Assume that it fires a three round burst every 2 seconds with a 540rpm rate of fire. That's 9 rounds per second, or (161.25 * 3) 483.75 damage if we spec fully into damage. That's a DPS of 217.68. By comparison, the *base* DPS of the shuriken is 371.52. So we're not doing a whole lot of damage with our turret.

**Cryo Ammo**

Not strictly an attack, it freezes only unshielded enemies.

**The Rockets**
 
rocketcooldown = 3 seconds (was 4)

rocketdamage = 300 (was 150)

rocketforce = 300N

rocketradius = 2.5m (was 1.5m)

minimumrange = 5m (was 10m)

maximumrange = 60m

The gun has higher damage versus single targets

**The shock**

shockcooldown = 2s (was 5s)

shockdamage = 100

shockforce = 1000N (was 450N)

shockradius = 5m (was 2.5m)

maximumrange = 1.9m

The shock attack has fairly substantial force. Enough to staggar a gold dragoon

**The flamethrower**

Base DPS is 65. There's a value ""flamethrowerdamageduration"" set to 1.0 in the coalesced file. I'm not really sure what it does.

##Geth Turret

Popular opinion has it that this turret's gun deals more damage than that of the quarian turret. As far as I can tell

The turret uses its ""gun"" every 3 seconds. If we spec fully into damage for this gun (power damage, it'll do 393.75 damage per shot. 393.75 damage per shot every 3 seconds is underwhelming, even when compared to the quarian/turian sentry turret, which itself is underpowered compared to the shuriken. We're not sure whether it's affected by armour damage reduction. But even if it is, it's going to lose less of its damage to armour DR than the quarian turret.

However

**Healing** 

A feature unique among pets

**The flamethrower**

On higher difficulties, he'll detonate the tech combo. Remember that fire explosions cannot be detonated on enemies with shields or barriers.

Unlike the geth turret's gun

##Combat Drone

We'll assume that combat drone acts the same way as the sentry turret and that each of its attacks shares a cooldown (certainly, the explosion, the shock and the rockets

If you choose the shields and damage options in ranks 4 and 5

The health of the drone is indictated by the colour of the aura surrounding it. At mid-level health it's orange. When it's about to die

**The Zap**

Does:

40 damage

on a 3 second cooldown

with 175N of force

with a 10m range

For chain lightning, that there is a max jump distance of 10m and a 0.5 second jump delay

**The explosion**

Naturally

400 damage

800N force

In a 5m radius

The explosion is blocked by cover

It's worth noting that the explosion will set off tech combos.

**The shock**

3 second cooldown

100 damage

1000N of force

in a 5m radius

maximum targets is 2

With a 1.9m max range

To repeat

**The rockets**

3 second cooldown

300 damage

300N of force

2.5m radius

4m minimum range. 

If you equip your drone with rockets

Rockets provide high single-target damage and higher damage for targets closely grouped together than the chain lightning evolution. The chain lightning evolution is better against spread out bunches of mooks. Volus sentinels might want to think about whether they are able to get enemies grouped around their decoys in tight bunches. If they are

Taken together, or enemies that are close together for some reason (some enemies like abominations hunt in packs, others may be clustered together because of a decoy). A drone built this way will have 1100 shields. If we look at [enemy damage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArNVjEsDluBFdFhvQkRHR2VBNFBRUnNERzlIeHhRUXc&amp;output=html) and combine it with what we know from Cyonan's damage thread here - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15699700/ - , we can see that a rocket drone will survive around 11 bullets from a marauder on gold. The staggar from the rockets ensures a bit more survivability fortunately. And naturally not all the enemies bullets connect. So it's a wee bit more durable than the statistics would imply. Rocket drones also tend to stay closer to you, so likely enemies aiming at them won't be shooting at you or your teammates, which is a great bonus. You may want to consider whether to take a heavier weapon if you're building your drone to be less frequently deployed.

Lately however, and the chain lightning gives the drone something to do while moving from one group of enemies to another.

1359145149.0,179vze,Class 401: Introduction to Weapons,Kallously,32,4,21,"This series of guides will go over the various weapon classes in ME:3. An evaluation of each weapon's strengths

Before going into the weapons themselves

**Hit Scan vs Projectile Weapons**

These are the two different ways weapons are implemented in ME:3 (and most other games). 

For hitscan weapons

Projectile weapons actually fire an object that flies through the air and can usually be seen by the player (this is most easily seen on the Geth Plasma Shotgun or the Falcon). These weapons tend to be more difficult to use in high latency matches as the projectiles usually have noticeable travel time. Projectile weapons have a high chance to apply ammo powers compared to their hitscan counterparts.

**Shield Gate**

From the Bioware Gameplay Mechanics thread (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/347/index/9822648):

&gt; Whenever an enemy shield/barrier is destroyed (last point taken off)

&gt; * 50% on Bronze

&gt; * 75% on Silver and up

&gt; This means that if an enemy has a single sliver of shields on Insanity/Gold, keep in mind that most fire multiple pellets, so even if some of the damage gets cut off on one of the pellets, the remaining pellets should pass through to the health/armor. 

Typically

High burst single shot weapons suffer much more from the gate due to how they deal their damage. To combat shield gate

Certain weapons also completely ignore shield gates (mostly projectile weapons).
For more information

**Armour** 

Enemies that have armour (opposed to health) will reduce all incoming packets of damage by a fixed amount. For rapid fire weapons or shotguns armour penetration is extremely important

Armour on a target can either be penetrated (the damage reduction is lowered for only the player) or weakened (the damage reduction is lowered for everyone in the squad).

To deal with armour, cryo, or warp ammunition, or armour penetration weapon mods. Certain powers may also weaken armour (such as cryo blast and warp).

Armour penetration stacks additively with itself (65% penetration + 25% penetration = 90% penetration

Certain weapons may also innately ignore the damage reduction (usually projectile weapons).

**Cover Penetration**

The cover that enemies attempt to hide behind can be shot through given the right weapon or modification (albeit usually with significantly lowered damage). This includes thin physical barriers

In general

Certain weapons also possess some innate cover penetration. All sources of cover penetration stack additively. If a weapon does not have innate cover penetration

**Cooldown

Certain weapons do not use ammo in the same way as other weapons. Similar to how ME1 weapons functioned, they need to go through a long cooldown animation that must be fully completed. Magazine size increases are highly valuable on these sort of weapons.

For other weapons

Lastly, and/or ammo consumption up to cap. 

Getting staggered or entering active cover will reset a charge or revved up state.

**Reload Cancelling**

Reload cancelling is an incredibly important skill players should know and leads to significantly reduced reload times (around 60% faster on the Claymore!).

When reloading a weapon

Keep an eye on the clip indicator. As soon as it refills, or casting a power will do the cancel. Some PC players might find it convenient to bind medigel to an accessible key like control and use that to perform the cancel.

For a video demonstration

**The Right-Hand Advantage**

The Right-Hand Advantage (or RHA) is a very useful tactic that players can use to significantly reduce damage while still being able to shoot.

Since all characters are right-handed and this game is 3rd person

[See this image for an example](http://imgur.com/0J1xXLu)

Note that the RHA is not the same as active cover. While the player is completely obscured from fire

To help maximize the effectiveness of the RHA

For a video demonstration

**Weapon Modifications**

All weapons allow for two modifications at any given time.

Most of the mods are straightforward in description (for exact formulas

It is worth noting a few things:

* Projectile weapons do not benefit much

* If a gun has innate cover penetration

* Melee mods increase melee damage multiplicatively whereas power mods only work additively. Both kinds only take effect when the weapon they are attached to is the currently active weapon.

1354705072.0,14bg0n,Quarksman,spark2,31,5,49,"So the new build this week is the Quarian Marksman


[**BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/QuarianMarksman/QNANR/CerberusHarrier10AF5AD5//AssaultRifleRailAmp3/StabilizationModule4/BarrageUpgrade5/)


**Marksman**: The core of this build. For 4, you're going to want to go Headshots and Acc/ROF for the other two. Basically, this build is around turning our masked friend into the headshotter from hell, so the fourth evo should go accuracy if you're using an inaccurate AR to make that headshotting more consistent, or ROF if your AR is good enough to consistently get headshots.

**Tac Scan**: This is the other half of your power combo. The way to use it is simple: just tac scan and start firing: the cooldown should wear off at some point while you're still firing (it's short, which refills your clip, and go to town. Take Weapon damage (obviously), ~~Headshots (see where I'm going with the headshots?)~~ and your preference for 6. I like Area scan just for the utility and extra awareness, but it's up to you.

*Apparently

**Sabotage**: Skip it. The only way to not make the CD terrible with a decent AR is to take more points than I'm willing out of something else. I can see going for a support build for a tech team with tech vulnerability on this plus power damage on tac scan

**Offensive Passives**: Straight weapon damage and headshots. You don't have any damage dealing powers

**Fitness**: At least until Bioware makes his defense not terrible, but wait for the fix next week, and this guy'll actually be able to take some hits.


**WEAPONS**

Basically any accurate assault rifle that you can reliably get headshots with. I use the Harrier (because of course), or even the Collector Rifle. Just aim for the squishy bits, and you're golden. If you're using something with a lot of recoil, you may want to throw on a stability upgrade. Otherwise, you definitely want some piercing on this guy, since he is a hell of a boss killer. Scopes help you headshot, and damage is always nice if nothing else fits. I go stability and piercing.

**GEAR**


It really depends on what you're using for a weapon. Since I go Harrier, or straight up AR amp if you're not. For consumables, anything to boost damage is nice. Again, Stability if you need it (**remember, you're not a Turian!**), headshots and AR if you don't. AP ammo or Drill ammo is nice because it eliminates the need for an AP mod, freeing up a slot.

**STRATEGY**


~~Pretty simple: just point and shoot. Like I said before, then marksman when your clip is almost empty to really go medieval on their asses (or heads). Headshot as much as possible, and they will drop like flies. This guy tears up Collectors better than most classes because of their gigantic freakin' heads, which practically beg for you to hit them. And remember, Tac Scan boosts other people's damage too, so teaming up with other weapons classes (snipers especially) works wonders.~~

Okay, and tac scan doesn't allow him to be the headshot monster I thought he'd be. Long story short, he's weird. You have to play him almost like an infiltrator rather than a soldier. Your low defenses coupled with the complete lack of AOE/panic button means that you have to stay constantly on the move to find the safest spot you can shoot people from without letting anyone sneak up behind you. 

I've also found that my Quarksman is a surprisingly good pair with a Demolisher, and I'm really sad that no one can see that), along with ammo aplenty, and you just go goddamn nuts at mid- to long-range. Try it out-- I had fun. It's best if they have some kind of shotgun or something to deal with close range threats, as you can take care of anything else.

**Build** [**N**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Quarian/FNPPF/Claymore10BH5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3//GrenadeCapacity5/) - [**K**](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#54!3806555!!34O533!5AE95)


**Tactical cloak:**

This build doesn't involve a sniper rifle

**Sticky Grenades:**

It sometimes seems as if these things have disappeared into the abyss

Which is very surprising, those classes don't have cloak.

Take damage on the first choice

I recommend taking grenade gear with this class

Lastly, but also provides a lot of utility.  

It’s much more forgiving if you miss a grenade, chances are something's gonna walk into it anyway. Also it's great against phantoms, because they don't raise their bubble if they walk into one. 

**Sabotage:**

Sabotage might not be the godly power of doom and destruction it once was, sets up tech-bursts and makes synthetic enemies do retarded shit. 

First take backfire damage

Now next, but one is even worse than the other. Recharge speed is completely useless because of cloak and explosive hack only really does anything against geth. Against geth, the extra damage and staggers are nice to have though. 

Finally
While it doesn't affect sticky grenades (those are a combat power)

First of all

All tech explosions are also affected by tech vulnerability. As far as I know this is the only power that increases tech combo damage that actually works

Tech vulnerability is of course even more awesome if there are any heavy tech characters on your team. Vorchas, quarian engineer, human engineer... Tech vulnerability will make these classes godlike. 

**Quarian Defender:**

The first two choices here can really go either way and it really doesn't make much of a difference. If you have damage cloak

The second one really depends on what weapon you are using and how good you are at getting headshots. 

Finally

**Fitness:**

Durability.

---

**Weapons:**

First of all

Sticky grenades tend to be easier to use from close to your target

For maximum boom-boom effect

As far as I know reload-cancelling on console is a bit of bitch though

The wraith is the next option, so that might be the way to go for console users. 

Other than that the typical high dps weapons (reegar, talon, saber) will of course work as well, but if you want to make the most out of the weird sticky grenade + ammo effect behaviour (explained below), you want to maximize damage per single shot.  

---

**Da Videos:**

Gameplay is much easier to show than to descripe

[Female Quarian Infiltrator gold solo](http://youtu.be/IiZSQGkjIh8)
---

For some reason my gameplay really went down the drain somewhere around wave 7 in this game

There are time-links for the waves and my death/ops-packs in the description as well as some comments. 

Because this is an infiltrator I originally wanted to platinum for the video

Still
If nothing else

The exact build I used for the videos is [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Quarian/ENFLR/Claymore10BH5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/GrenadeCapacity5/).

**About sticky grenade weirdness:**

I added this section after the large amount of confusion about sticky grenades and ammo damage and tech vulnerability in MasterVash's thread. I hope I can clear everything up.

First of all

There is a reason though why the stickies seem to do more damage than they should. 

There is a bug (or a really weird mechanic) that makes sticky grenade apply ammo effects to a target (when they are stuck to it). They do additional damage based on the ammo and weapon you are using. They also apply any other ammo effects (armor weakening

Now as for the reason why incendiary ammo is so ridiculously awesome on this class:

Because ammo effects are applied before the grenade explosion

So the already insane damage of the sticky grenades gets boosted even further. With a claymore X

    (1648*0.5)=824   incendiary ammo damage over 3 seconds
    (1100*(1+0.2+0.3+0.1+0.1+0.15+0.4)*1.5)=3712.5    sticky grenade damage (with cloak
    100*(1+((1+6)-2)*0.15)*3.375*2*1.5=1771.875  fire explosion damage (against armor

    824+3712.5+1771.875=6308.375  total damage

With damage cloak and full damage on stickies it could go up to:
   
    (1100*(1+0.2+0.3+0.1+0.1+0.15+0.4+0.8)*1.5)=5032.5  sticky grenade damage (with cloak

     824+5032.5+1771.875=7628.375   total damage (just short of killing a ravager

Keep in mind though that for a fire explosion

This only really works with incendiary ammo. Cryo ammo can only be detonated when the target is completely frozen (which is only possible on health) and I'm not completely sure if it would work with disruptor ammo on armored targets

Here is an example of why this is so good. Assuming you 1. cloak; 2. sticky grenade; 3. sabotage; 4. claymore:

    4536.5    sticky grenade damage (including incendiary dot over 3 seconds)
    1771.9    fire explosion damage (this may or may not mess with the incendiary dot)
    4268.4    claymore damage (including incendiary dot over 3 seconds
    1057.5    sabotage backfire damage against armor
    
    4536.5+1771.9+4268.4+1057.5=11624.4    total damage against armor

Basically

*(edit: Made a mistake. Should be about 700 less. Too lazy to redo.)*

I'm pretty happy about getting this into one post this time. I even have a couple characters to spare!

She is also great to have on any tech team

**Preface**

There was a Harrier circle-jerk thread last week where people claimed that the ""The Harrier is the best assault rifle by miles"" (better yes, I decided to try and mix the two. The results were better than expected

**Introduction**

The critical weakness of the Harrier is its lack of spare ammo. Fortunately there's this pretty cool gear called Thermal Clip Storage

Also, I don't want any part of that. By the grace of BioWare, the Havoc has the benefit of possessing Cryo Blast. Cryo Blast is a debuffing power affecting speed and armor reduction, and is capable of doing so in a radius and can increase the damage an enemy takes. 

Considering the Harrier gets hit pretty hard by armor damage reduction

**Cryo Blast**

This power gets you farther than you think. Slowing down enemies and weakening armor by default

Because the Harrier has has such little spare ammo, the area evolution was taken to deal with that. 

Before shooting a burst form the Harrier

**Stim Packs**

Maxing out shielding is useful

I prefer pack numbers instead of duration because at such a low number of Stim Packs

Use these as preemptive Survival Ops Packs

**Passives**

Considering that Cryo Blast deals no damage and has a quick recharge

*Fun Fact*- Combining the stability bonuses with a stability mod on the Harrier completely eliminates the recoil on the Harrier.

Considering that I rarely melee as well

**Weapons and Gear**

Easily the most important part here, and hits pretty hard for its rate of fire. Naturally, we want to find other weapons that can fit these criteria as well. Those weapons include the likes of the Collector Assault Rifle, Phaeston, Vindicator, Piranha, and Scimitar. 

Now once you have your weapon of choice, I would recommend just weapon damage gear like the Shotgun Amp and Warfighter Package.

I like the Harrier here because I have to go back to ammo boxes every now and then (don't have to camp with Thermal Clip Storage V) for Stim Packs anyways

**Conclusion**

So if you want to try out a rapid fire weapon, yet quite effective and is even capable of being a strong team player by debuffing and tanking enemies.

The Players:

2 Krogan Sentinels

1 Volus Engineer. - Spec'd for shield spamming as fast as possible. Carry an Acolyte X to help take down boss's shields

The Game Play:

We picked a party lead (in our case the vorcha) and everyone made sure to stay with the vorcha. The vorcha controlled where the group went

Because we were all staying with Senior Vorcha

The result:
---------------------------------------------

An orgy of fire explosions and melee death. The Krogan's tasks were to annihilate bosses with weapon fire and grenades, we backed onto a ramp and let Krogans go to town melee style while the vorcha used flamer. 

We pushed through Gold Reapers using almost no consumables in about 26 minutes. Almost no one went down and it was a hell of a lot more fun then sitting behind a desk.

1350237286.0,11gvfy,Post Retaliation: Rank the Factions,PostCool,31,4,76,"I played a ton this weekend and I've got to say that I'm getting over my sheer terror of the Collectors. It does feel like they have a little more health on average than equal units of other factions

1. Cerberus: Still pretty predictable. Aside from Phantoms they don't really have a unit that makes you stop with the Rambo. The new Dragoons stagger pretty easily and while that Hornet hurts from range they go down easy enough IMO. My reaction time is a lil better than Kip's, even with the new missile DoT. His weak spots are huge and easy to hit.

2. Reapers: I think familiarity really helps with Reapers. They're the only faction that hasn't changed much as of late. The Banshee is the only scary unit and she's manageable when the barrier is down. Her buggy sync kill, but awareness and a team that can prioritize targets properly reduces their impact. The lack of a cloaked or very undersized unit makes playing against these guys pretty straight forward. 

3. Collectors: They're new so tactics are still developing but these guys can be beat if the team stays cool and keeps on the move. Praetorians are scary looking but focus fire on the skull box on their chest, but they are slow and their bubbles aren't impossible to hit. They seem to be priority targets even in pugs. Swarms suck for power users, but that's why you have a gun. Keep up the pew pew until your powers are back online. The Captains and basic units have HUGE heads. I've gotten more headshots against Collectors than any other faction. Possesion and aggression lift these guys above Reapers by a fair bit. Ihate them most on Hazard because they're pretty quiet overall.

4. Geth: Every unit aside from the basic Trooper is broken in some form. Hunter range is insane and stagger is just a mirage. Pyros have range beyond the flame graphic and dodge too often for a shield/armor unit. At least it's very slow. Bombers don't have a stagger that I've seen and are WAY too mobile for an armored/shielded unit. Giving them a stun feels like a middle finger. Rocket Troopers should make youtube videos on reload cancelling and they bend missiles better than I bend biotic powers. Primes would be the second easiest boss if they didn't spam tiny turrets with the DPS of a marauder

TL;DR: Cerberus easiest, Geth hardest.

My favorite build at the moment would be the [Geth Infiltrator](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#43PIRNA@0@0) with a Javelin. 

Tact - Damage - Recharge -Sniper (The second is really personal preference

Hunter Mode - Bottom 3

Network AI - Weapon Damage Headshots and Weapon Damage
 
After this it's personal preference - I upped Prox Min to damage taken so you can do even more damage

With this build without equipment you can easily take off half a prime's health with one headshot while cloaked. Throw in the Sniper Rail and Armor Piercing equipment and you can one shot almost anything on Gold. 


Here are some other builds I found very useful on gold

[Salarian Infiltrator](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s0pza/the_salarian_shotgunner/)

[Drell Adept](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rl0hy/my_drell_adept_build_and_some_advice/) I prefer the Justicar but if you are getting bored with Asari 

[Krogan Murdertrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s73o9/all_aboard_the_murdertrain_or_how_to_krogan/) This may be the same as this -

[Geth Engineer ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/sba9c/this_platform_will_now_efficiently_eliminate_all/c4cmxj7)

[Human Vanguard](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s09sa/how_to_human_vanguard/)
 This does work

[Batarian](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/sk2o3/batarian_brute_2_bladed_boogaloo/) Mizzon has a couple Batarian Builds that I can't vouch for as I don't really like the Batarians.

It's very feasible from a developer perspective. Art assets are already there, hack objectives make a lot of sense when you are trying to get through a locked door and enemies barrel down on you. It would give ME3 a whole ""fight through the instance to kill the final boss."" feel.

**Powers**

**Geth Turret** - With the changes to AI behaviour with respect to pets Turrets
But
restore you shields on occasion.  While holding ground and shooting I like to park it near to me.  It's also good to cast to cancel DoT effects 
and during escorts or package retrieval.

**Hunter Mode** - Increased accuracy, run speed and wallhax.  All this for 375 shields.  An easy choice from my point of view.  
Accuracy and fire rate can't be improved through any equipment or gear so I always choose them.  In addition I find the Saber benefits greatly from both of these.
I prefer Speed and Vision for the final evolution for the increase to awareness and survivability it offers.

**Overload** - Unlike my [Turian Sentinel](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/184uma/turian_sentinel/) build I don't feel maxing single target damage is required for this character.  
The Geth Engineer has good mobility
opportunity to detonate self or team-mates Tech Combos.  Because of the way Neural Shock and Shield Damage work they are too good to pass up.  This set up still allows 2516 damage to organic shields and barriers - 
1887 to robots.

**Network AI** - Our main source of damage is our weapon all choices are geared to increase base and headshot damage.

**Advance Hardware** - Since Hunter Mode takes 375 shields payment I gear all options to increasing shields / fitness.

-----
**Weapons**

**M-99 Saber** - This gun is awesome on any class with a boost to accuracy and fire rate.  Depending on the ammo consumable there are two ways to run it.  The one constant is the Extended Barrel.  
It's because of headshots.  With Overload to stun and strip shields and the Hunter Mode bonuses landing headshots becomes much more frequent.  The extended barrel means consistently more damage and 14% more headshot damage for the linked build.
The second slot can be filled with the vanilla piercing mod if using Disruptor

Other weapon options that work well are the Indra, Harrier, Wraith, M-98 Widow (Legion style points added), Geth Plasma Shotgun, Viper and Mantis.

1376422837.0,1karia,/R/MeCoOp: The Drinking Game- PvP || Results,RepublicanShredder,31,2,57,"So last night, and smakl all attempt the drinking game I wrote. Before I start

______________________________________________

**How to start PvP**: You must be in a lobby full of redditors (4 redditors) who are verbally communicating. Drinks must be readily on hand.

**What you must have on hand**: Your favorite drink ready to go. This is a competitive game. Additional cups are advised.

**Goal of the game**: Winner takes all. First place gets one point

**Rules**

To keep things simple, and 10) and in the lobby of a game. 

*Lobby*

Before the first game starts, with the difficulty level staying constant (I personally recommend Gold). After the first game, placement will allow specific actions to occur and they will be described in the *Score Screen* section.

*General gameplay (Any wave)*

* If a player gets sync killed

* If a player gets a revive medal

* If a killstreak medal is rewarded, no one takes a drink. If the dispute is illegitimate, then you are a filthy liar and RepublicanShredder hates your guts.

* If a waves survived medal is rewarded

* If, then no one made it to the extraction zone and everyone must finish their drink.

*Objective Waves*

* During *Devices* (1-2-3-4 Objective)

* During *Hack* or *Escort*

* During *Assassination* (targets), the player must take 3 drinks.

* Also during *Retrieval*

*Score Screen*


Players go from highest to lowest score instituting these next effects.

1. The top scorer can institute a new drinking rule of his/her choosing. This rule can be rejected by a unanimous veto. This drinking rule will last one game and cannot be a finisher.

2. The second top scorer will choose the kit the top scorer must use in the next game.

3. The third scorer will choose the map the next game will be played on. 'Unknown' is a valid option here.

4. The player in last place will choose the enemy that will be played in the next game. 'Unknown' is a valid option here.


Finally, 210k, 130k, and 60k, the top player must take (0 for second place + 2 for third place +3 for fourth place) 5 drinks. If further clarification is needed, then send me a score screen and I will explain in further detail.

If a player gets first more than once in a row, and finally it includes weapons.

___________________________________________________

So

* I have not tested PvE. Maybe in the future I will try and there may be some tougher changes there. I feel in PvE I would either die after the second match because of puns or become a cheap Ahnold quoter. Or both

* I was the sober one of the party

* I tweaked a few rules right before playing as I realized some were selfish/complicated. There was a rule where doing my favorite chant would result in drink immunity

* Some people (Warden) are so good at this game that drinking enough alcohol to down a Krogan does not stop him from staying in first place. I think additional punishment (non-alcohol related ideally- I think Warden drank the most out of all of us) should be in place to prevent the overly-skilled from winning. The only way we stopped his winning streak was making him play a Volus Sentinel, Strength Enhancer, Power Amplifier, and Medigel Transmitter against on-host Cerberus. And none of us outscored him by 50k to take a drink.

* Missing extraction can be brutal on some player's livers. I think something like 5 drinks were finished last night because of it. RIP everyone except me in the lobby (sorry smakl

* Because Warden was the best at hosting (lada's connection isn't great, we only got Escorts and Retrieval as objectives. It's good, as those are the two toughest objectives to drink for but we did not get the fun that could have been Assassination. The Drink Sergeant for Retrieval was interesting, as I think that was the only time I saw redditors *not* sprint with the device. Props to InterwebNinja for suggesting it.

* Some of the winner rules were quite interesting. Warden instituted using only Liquid Thunder (a great time was had by all, drink everytime lada gets a Batarian Gauntlet punch interrupted, and I forced everyone to use Uncommon/Common weapons. Loads of fun were had by these rules. I bet other people could come with someone equally clever.

* In general, it's perfectly fine to hold your drink until the end of the wave as long as you remember how many you had to take. Thankfully, everyone was honest in this regard.

* Surprisingly, probably because after the first game Warden had to take 9 drinks because he's a scorewhore.

* A great bonding opportunity was had by all at the end of the session (which Warden won by a long shot). I feel celibate when /r/LadyBoners is discussed in detail

* This was a fun opportunity and I highly encourage everyone who can to try it. None of us failed,[Story Time],False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,True

Equipment
---

* **Weapons** 

For this build

Alternatives are the piranha

If you really want you can also substitute the acolyte with a talon

For mods, though on gold it isn't really necessary to cross any damage thresholds. On platinum it's invaluable however. 

* **Gear and consumables**

As gear, so it's not the end of the world. In that case I would take an adaptive war amp. 

For armor equipment, or adrenaline mods for faster grenade acquisition and even better mobility. 

On platinum I highly recommend a power amp IV

As ammo you definitely want incendiary. It allows you to detonate fire explosions everywhere and also gives you good damage against boss armor. 

Finally, otherwise you wont be able to one shot phantom barriers. 

---

Gameplay:
-

You have three very powerful attacks that combine together really well: 

* **Acolyte** 

Shots will prime any enemy they hit for a fire explosion and strip any shield from every single ground enemy on gold (and on platinum if you take pistol rail amp III). 

Always keep the acolyte charged up

If you have the acolyte ready to fire and then charge

* **Charge** 

Will detonate any fire explosions primed by the acolyte

On gold every ground enemy will die to one acolyte shot and charge (except dragoons and pyros). 

* **Lift grenades**

With all the power buffs, including phantoms, pyros and possessed captains. 

Ravagers die to three grenades. Brutes take five

Lift grenades also have a large radius

The grenades also can actually detonate combos on health enemies

**About bosses**

None of this is particularly awesome against bosses

But hey

Naturally, and he takes out the biggies. 

**Factions**

Reapers and collectors are the harder factions with this class
For the boss armor
Additionally, just dodge back immediately after charge hits. 

And while the asari is awesome against reapers and collectors
Against geth

I didn't do platinum for this one because a) [I've done way too many plat solos lately](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1a50vi/field_report_doing_lodestar_the_hard_way/) and b) playing this class in a platinum solo would look quite different from how I actually play her in a normal game (much less charging

So in this case I feel doing a gold would paint a better picture of how to play this class. 

I think this is one of the best games of mecoop that I've ever played and I'm extremely proud of it.   
10 waves survived with a squishy vanguard is sweet (and lucky!). Less than 25 minutes is great. 

Both combined in one game is beyond amazing for me. 

I also think that this video does a great job of showing just how *ridiculous* this class is. 

*Note: I'm using a cyclonic modulator in the video

---

Alternate builds
---

Part of the reason I love the asari vanguard so much is that there are so many viable ways to build her. The build I showed here is a very ""try-hard"" way to play her and while this is probably the most powerful build for her

Here are some other awesome builds that you can check out:

* [Check here if you want to play a stasis sniper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/112yl2/the_asari_commando_asari_vanguard_sniper/) I would recommend the kishock or the black widow over the viper though. Shredder went a little too far with the crazy there. 

* [Look here for aaron's take on a very versatile stasis-headshot-shotgun build.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11xz2c/council_operative_vanguard/) I personally don't feel that 6 ranks in stasis do you all that much good

* [Check multidisciplinary's post here

* xcalizorz/the3nd also did [a video with a similar build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myO0P2YSijI&amp;feature=share&amp;list=SPE61EC5FF7149FF45) a while ago

---

Random tips
---

* **Host the game**

Seriously, because the combo priming doesn't work instantly like on host. If you really want to play the asari vanguard without hosting, I would recommend aaron's build. Not with the graal though. 

* **Thermal packs!**

Use them! They are awesome. 

* **Phantoms (and dragoons)**

If you are playing cerberus (or platinum) make killing phantoms your first priority. Acolyte + charge

* **Banshees**

If you have to kill a banshee by yourself

At this point she also starts doing her hand of denial thing, and after she does her screamo aoe attack. 

This works out perfectly, you can do two or three grenades. 

* **Praetorians**

You want to avoid bringing up their power-block-bubble. If they are floating

So have another!

BUILD: http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Human/PLLID/Paladin4BP5AI5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule3/ShieldBooster5/

POWERS:

Combat drone - it's Mr. Splodey.  You want your drone to be as close to your enemies as possible, and it can stagger enemies pretty well.

Incinerate - nothing new here.  Standard (IMHO) build for a human engineer.  Damage, BURN THEM!

Overload - This is great for crowd control

Weapon - Paladin.  I used to run a Carnifex, and i got my first 25 pistol kill medal.  For someone with my set of skills (not many), i find that impressive on a power based class.  Power magnifier is nice for MOAR DAMAGE, the small mag size demands the extended mag.  If you can reliably hit headshots, switch the extended mag for the headshot mod.

GEAR/EQUIPMENT:

Pistol amp is obvious.  Power amp is good.  I also like shield booster, but RNG doesn't want me to have cyc mods.  


TACTICS:

Remember the drone.  Each time you see a big boss, but YMMV.

For shielded enemies

Yup.

I have done very well with this build

1362873856.0,19zwcb,Mr. Instakill (Drell Vanguard),MrPaulBalls,34,5,21,"So today, after a respec card or two


[Build Link](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/Drell/OMAPR/NPiranha10BH5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3/AdrenalineModule3/GethScanner5/)


Alright. Let's get started with the walkthrough.

**BIOTiC CHARGE**
The first three ranks are nothing special, and 6. 

* **Rank 4**: Fairly standard

* **Rank 5**: We're gonna roll with weapon damage on this one. Since this build has no points into cluster grenades

* **Rank 6**: While most builds will take the full barrier evolution over the 50% cool down chance, if not the best, evolutions for a power in the entire game, right up there with Shield Drain on Annihilation Field and Shield Penetration on Lash. 
This evolution says it gives you a fifty percent chance of not having Biotic Charge trigger a cool down, higher. While playing, I could sometimes manage 6 charges in a row, with 5 being a little less rare and 4 happening on a fairly consistent basis. The evo allows you to stun-lock enemies like crazy, also giving you the option to dash out of a sticky situation when it does work. Being able to charge twice in a row also practically gives you the Full Barrier Restore, while giving you double the damage. In tandem with the multiple target evolution in rank 4, you can often keep 3-4 enemies under control with relative ease.


**PULL**
Pull is a somewhat situational power, even with a smart choke attached. Pull renders those who do survive useless, and also sets them up for a very powerful biotic explosion, which kills mostly all the other mooks around for the explosion.

* **Rank 4**: Duration is gonna be taken here allowing us to leave lesser enemies disabled so we can focus on the bigger ones. Simple, and thus isn't gonna often see multiple enemies within a 2.5 meter radius.

* **Rank 5**: This evolution is one I'm not so sure about, both evos in Rank 5 aren't very good to me so if you want the DOT evolution instead you could also take that.


* **Rank 6** We're gonna go with the Biotic Explosion evo so when we need to


**PASSIVES**
These are pretty simple choices

* **Drell Assassin**:
Take all the Power Damage evos and then the Weapon Damage evo in rank six so our piranha can spit out even more death. 

* **Fitness**:
Take all Durability


**WEAPONS**

For my weapon choice on this guy, and will tear apart anything within close range. Since this is a Vanguard, he's going to be in close range most of the time anyways, making the gun a perfect fit. It can see some decent distance with the smart choke, but you will definitely have a hard time hitting the smaller targets, so try to keep it as a close range weapon. (this isn't a TSol with a claymore, alright?)



After using this guy for a bit, I topped the scoreboard with more than 150k points in each match. Collectors became a joke from how fast I killed things. Atlas mechs? Dropping in under 15 seconds easily.
It is also wise to use Incendiary Ammo for fire explosions



**SIDENOTE** /u/SimplyWaffle can attest to me killing things crazy fast and topping the scoreboards every game. Seriously

*This is the exact build I use in the video

* **Rank 6 shockwave**

In my opinion the hilarious moments lifting shockwave produces are enough reason to take it. But logically

* **Rank 6 barrier vs. ranks 1

Taking recharge speed on barrier gives you slightly quicker cooldowns than the capacity from rank 1 in the passives

Keep in mind that neither shockwave nor warp profits very much from power damage and the incendiary ammo damage is not affected by weapon damage bonuses.

In my video I have 3 points in berserker

* **Rank 6 warp**

This depends on what ammo you plan on using. If you go with incendiary (my recommendation)

But if you intend to use warp ammo

---

**Weapons**
-

Yeah.... Reegar. It's the best suited gun to abuse the warp/incendiary bug

If you don't want to use the reegar, harrier or piranha are good choices. 

If you don't want to use the reegar and you don't want to abuse the bug, hurricane, graal or any other high dps weapon, all with warp ammo.

If you are okay with the reegar, this can get almost as ridiculous as with incendiary ammo. 

For gear

For armor equipment, take shield power cells. And if you want more mobility, take adrenaline mods. 

---

**Gameplay**
-

The general idea is to hit enemies with warp

This leads to a krogan vanguard-ish playstyle

My love for shield-recharge on this kit ties into this. In normal games

A couple of quick questions/comments:

* Cyonan's enemy spawn spreadsheet is wrong for platinum collectors (especially wave 5

* God damn

* Other than that collectors were much easier than I expected. The lack of phantoms

**How to incendiary/warp bug**
-

*I know that not everyone is a fan of abusing this and some people even think that this is cheating. In my opinion there are two reasons why this is fair game:* 

*a) If bioware thought this was a game breaking issue that shouldn't be used then they should at least* attempt *to fix it

*b) The incendiary stacking bug is basically unavoidable in normal gameplay

*You don't have to agree with me on this, so if you don't want to use the bug, I recommend doing that.* 

Now

Let's start with how incendiary ammo is supposed to work. Every shot should do the amount stated (30%/50%) in the ammo description

So for a weapon with a base damage of 1000 and incendiary III, or 100 damage per second.

As long as you only shoot a target once

Imagine you fire two shots with the 1000 base damage weapon. After the first shot the incendiary does two normal ticks of 50 damage. Then you shoot again.
What should happen now

In reality, there damage is combined. So after the second shot, the incendiary effect does 6 ticks of 100 damage, instead of 4 ticks with 50 from the first shot and 6 ticks with 50 from the second shot, for a total of 700 incendiary damage instead of the intended 600. 

(In real reality, but it doesn't really matter).

You can imagine that this leads to ludicrous damage if you shoot a target multiple times very quickly. With rapid fire weapons you can expect incendiary ammo to to about 2 or 3 times as much damage as stated.

Now enter warp and things get really weird. Warp has a small dot component that works for 10 seconds after warp is applied (the damage of this is usually insignificant).

Now

Well, because the incendiary ammo being applied as ""warp"" means that the incendiary ammo gets warp's multipliers against defenses (3.25 against barriers, 2.5 against armor, 1 against health and 0.5 against shields).

This means that in combination with warp

This is were the majority of the increased damage for the warp/incendiary comes from (expect about 4 or 5 times the stated damage). (Again

Additionally

Here are a couple of example of how this looks in gameplay:

[12:40 - Possessed scion with one warp](http://youtu.be/uLfDhND3Mjc?t=12m40s)   
[15:20 - Banshee (incendiary damage on barrier)](http://youtu.be/uLfDhND3Mjc?t=15m20s)

If you don't feel like reading through the entire fanfiction that is mostly lore-friendly (with a few references here and there), Rares, and Ultra-Rares).

Concussive Shot is geared towards knocking down lone targets, starting bleed damage on organics, detonating Tech Combos, and eviscerating Barriers. Frag Grenades are designed to stun a group of enemies and detonating Tech Combos while in Adrenaline Rush. Fitness is geared towards defenses while the investment into Alliance Training is dwarfed by the advantages gain in taking higher ranks into powers and Fitness.

______________________________________________
**New Operatives**

I can hardly remember what day it is today. Life has been sent upside down ever since the Reapers hit Earth. This program logs the date anyways

Ever since the Reapers landed, not all of them are even humans. I've got Krogan, Turians, Asari, and Salarians under my command. Even those who I would never expect to have a commanding position over such as the Vorcha, Volus, and Geth fall under my scope of operations. All these aliens work comparatively or even better than the few N7 graduates in my disposal. Even then, a few have a distinct mastery with biotics (they scare me

Now don't get me wrong, this behavior cannot be sustained. What's even worse is that [it's](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s84mf/comprehensive_rmecoop_thread/c4eh8i9?context=3) [a](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xeyll/the_onetwo_punch_human_soldier_build/) [popular](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/12lxdz/i_am_heavy_weapons_guy_and_this_is_my_weapon/) [mentality](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11ujau/doubledouble_barrels_at12_raider_human_soldier/) too. It seems to me that the issue is that the suit cannot provide power to both an adrenal dispenser and a concussive amplifier without shortchanging grenade capacity, so most opt for the more versatile adrenal dispenser and supplement the concussive amplifier with fragmentation grenades. I've seen some [experienced](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/vo9s2/the_human_paladin_soldier_crusader_build/) [operatives](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14gv3x/the_grenadier_human_soldier/) under my command that performed adequately in using all the tools given to them and I am inspired to find a way for new recruits to bring them straight up to speed on what I think are the best tactics.

I'll give those guys a lecture about teamwork tomorrow morning, it doesn't give him an excuse to act like this on my ship. He's not like most of the biotics as he does have some combat training, which may help in the future.

________________________________________________________________
**Tinkering Around**

Boy that lecture went over *swell*. The new recruits rotating under my command didn't take my speech about teamwork and survival very well. Johnson his sarcastic demeanor afterwords won't earn him any favors. He's going to get extra KP duty tonight for that. Baker too is going to be stuck cleaning the kitchen for encouraging Johnson to act like that. They'll probably talk about football or something like that

I've noticed that these new operatives are only equipped with basic Devlon and Rosenkov Materials armor. I guess the Alliance really is grabbing everything they can to outfit us with *something* to fight. Even their weapons are basic, Mattock, Tempest, and Eviscerator. Not bad, but they don't hit with enough force to fight the toughest battles. 

While I'll certainly requisition the Alliance for better weapons

_______________________________________________________________
**New Equipment**

It's been a few weeks since I sent those bricks to my pal at Hahne-Kedar and a requisition to the Alliance for better weapons. It seems the valor of my squads on Arvuna, and even Earth has earned enough recognition for the Alliance to send plenty of armaments and equipment my way. Looks like it pays to do the shit jobs no one else wants to do. I've also noticed that some officers have been clumsy with their hard drives in combat, but I'm just glad that it isn't *my* guys losing them.

I am literally swimming in equipment here. And I mean literally. The rest of the crew doesn't like it trying to find the equipment they need by pushing crates left and right before finding the right one. I have more than enough Thermal Clip Packs on hand that I encourage operatives to use grenades as a force multiplier if they are ever outnumbered and outgunned. It also seems that I got the cream of the crop as I see Cerberus Harriers, AT-12 Raiders, ""standard issue"" Valkyries (supposed to be available for everyone but someone screwed that one up), N7 Hurricanes, and many other weapons appearing in these crates from the Alliance. Also I seem to be loaded with temporary cyclonic modulators, stabilization modules, weapon amps, and more packages than I know what to do with. I'm so loaded with equipment sometimes I wonder how this ship can carry this much equipment and still be nimble. Probably something-something mass effect fields.

What I find even more exciting is that I got a couple of packages from my pal at H-K. Inside were a series of modified N7 Defender armor with those power bricks I sent them. It appears that H-K and Ariake worked together quickly to make a simple yet powerful armor that can be worn by those those with minimal combat training and built at nearly any colony with a factory planetside. Looks like Udina's words of putting every colony to work is finally having an effect. The armor seems to have extra room for plenty of fragmentation grenades

I'm even more surprised that the armor seems to have both a Binary Helix adrenaline dispenser AND an H-K concussive launcher power cell right next to each other. It seems that it is possible to have soldiers go into both an Adrenaline Rush and shoot Concussive Shots [without switching armor pieces](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Human/ONIDR/NValkyrie2AE5AD5////WarfighterPackage5/).
____________________________________________________________________
**Lose Some

Today was a tough day. I was observing Johnson's cam as I wanted to see how he handled the new suit from H-K and I was quite pleased. It took him some time to adjust being able to use both the adrenal dispenser, but he finally got the hang of it. I even learned that an concussive blast powered by the suit can destabilize explosive plasma on targets in addition to power surges caused by omnitools. I forgot that the techs made those upgrades and I will definitely try to [pair these recruits with the combat engineers](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1388bf/it_takes_two_to_tango_human_ingenuity/) in the future.

Unfortunately the cost of learning it was high. Baker was deployed with Johnson, Baker decided that the best way to get out of the situation was to biotically energize himself and charge straight into the Atlas. Normally this is an excellent tactic provided that Baker could escape. However a sneaky Cerberus Phantom was behind the Atlas and slashed Baker as soon as he landed in front of the Atlas, stunning him in the process. This gave the Atlas a window to pick up Baker with its left arm. Kat sent a  plasma bolt to try and finish off the Atlas while Johnson launched a Concussive Shot as he tried to get into range with his Revenant. The Atlas crushed Baker's body with its hand, but not soon after the plasma bolt and Concussive Shot landed right after one another, causing the mech to violently explode and killing both the Phantom and Atlas mech in one go. The rest of the squad extracted successfully, but Baker remained dead. I could see Johnson's pain after the mission, but I think he just needs some time to recover from the loss of his best friend. He can't dwell on the past given the galactic situation at hand.

After mourning Baker's death, those who took his words of encouragement to heart come back from ops alive and in record time. If I ever get promoted, I hope he gets to take my place.

A fine infiltrator kit, check out mrcle123's comparison in the comments). Still offers more survivability.

* Tac Cloak: Standard infiltrator variant. 
* Energy Drain: A very useful power. Restores shields
* Proximity Mine: Covered elsewhere

The basic variants are your sniper and shotgun infiltratror. ED lends the SI a degree of survivability that few other infiltrators can boast. My go-to guy for sniping with most SRs, for whom recovering shields can be an issue. SI can skip that via ED.). Shines against all factions but probably strongest against Geth.

**Salarian Engineer**

Once the farmer's dream, hit him hard. Still, in the right hands, a kit that can still be played effectively

* Decoy: Once his signature power (now available to the Volus Sentinel as well), partially. Then it got nerfed hard, especially as melee enemies ignored them. Now use it situationally i.e. place it in doorways. Never let the enemy see you place it, it will not draw their attention. The best way to get a feel for it is to simply practice with it. Also note you can't place it too far away from your current position when initially casting it.
* Energy Drain: As above
* Incinerate: Strong anti-armour power

A kit that is still strong against the Geth in particular, as do the middle-tier SRs (Valiant etc). Despite having two of the same powers as the Paladin, a comparison between the two falls short due to the massive differences in playstyle thanks to SF/Omnishield and Decoy.  

**Conclusion**

The SI continues to remain one of the best kits in the game, I highly recommend him. The SE needs something, hopefully a buff of some description is forthcoming, but he is by no means unusable. And right at the top of my wishlist for future DLC is more Salarian kits in general...

[***Fire! I'll take you to burn...doo doo doo...***](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4ExW1Fx0-k)

Remember when the patch came out all those weeks ago? There was something in there about Carnage priming Fire Explosions. And my immediate thought was ""wow that'll be pretty cool for BF3 soldier, and I've found something I really like. No longer will the BF3 soldier be just another AR soldier, variety is the name of the game and we're going to make full use of his powers to turn him into a really unique class.

[Build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#13AQMPR%5B9%400PEI%40L4N4%400%400)

Yes, the Reegar is freakishly strong already and really doesn't need the extra damage.

The Battlefield 3 soldier is unique in that he's the only class with Carnage that can actually reliably use it as a primer for fire explosions instead of a detonator. The Vorcha and Krogan Soldiers rely on priming FEs with Flamer and Inferno Grenades, meaning you can get through the short window of opportunity and set off big explosions on targets. Most people have only seen Incendiary ammo FEs so they aren't aware of just how devastating a max level combo is to armour. A Carnage-Frag combo will deal in total around 6000 damage. This is damn near half of a Gold Brute's HP and more than kills a Dragoon outright. It wipes a couple armour bars off an Atlas with each hit, and unlike incendiary ammo it's not bugged so you can do multiple combos in quick succession. You can then throw a second Frag Grenade while waiting for Carnage to come off cooldown to do another 2500+ damage before launching into your next combo. Pretty devastating. And this doesn't even factor in the additional DoT that's supposed to happen with a Fire Explosion, but supposedly that's bugged.

So that's for bosses. For low-level enemies, you probably don't even need to bother with combos on mooks, the Reegar melts everything that's not armoured anyway. The Reegar also provides your shield stripping abilities, which is why Frags are spec'd for armour damage instead. The attachments I used in the build generator are not definitive; if you don't like the Reegar's low spare ammo count you can swap out the barrel for the extra capacity mod, but seeing as you're a grenade class, I would argue spare ammo isn't a necessity if you're going to be frequenting the boxes anyway. Shredder Mod is a must though. I would recommend taking weapon damage in the last rank of class passive over more cooldown increases for Carnage just so you don't have to reload to strip everything's shields.


Because frags are pretty central to your boss killing ability, and any DoT effect is worth getting.

1351127440.0,121gdm,Flip McNeely:  Drell Vanguard Melee Build,InterwebNinja,28,2,11,"Before you get your pitchforks and torches, I think if played well

## ***ABSTRACT***

The Drell Vanguard has long been a symbol of weakness among players in the ME3 community.  This guide posits that it is not the Drell who is weak; on the contrary, one must play as the Drell and endure the humiliation of kick votes and deserted lobbies.  One must mildy annoy his teammates by performing space-ballet between waves.  One must space-kick a Brute in his cornhole.

## ***BUILD***

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#51QQFFKp9F9PE%40DF4H4E4D4) it is.

*~~Note: Ignore the melee numbers on the character builder because they are not calculated correctly.  The bonus from melee weapon mods is multiplicative, but you will probably need it if you intend on playing Gold.  I will get to that in the Equipment section.~~*

**Biotic Charge**

For the level 5 evolution, and most of the time when I'm using my secondary weapon, I'm not doing a lot of Biotic Charging.  But, if you're feeling frisky and like charging bosses and unloading from close range, you could take the Weapon Synergy.  This build won't require the bonuses you get from Power Synergy to be effective.

For the level 6 evolution, you are only going to get an additional ~170 shields back.  On the other hand, if you opt for Bonus Power, you may be able to get yourself out of some scrapes when you otherwise wouldn't.  Sure, it's unpredictable, but I guarantee it will eventually save your life.

**Pull**

This is pretty straightforward.  The most important thing is the level 6 evolution for the 75% combo damage.

**Cluster Grenades**

In this build, you might be questioning the strength of a biotic explosion using only a rank 4 power, but worry not.  On Gold, the strength of a biotic explosion on a lifted target (which, by definition will always have health and no shields) detonated by rank 4 Cluster Grenades is 1299.  Add in the 750 (minimum, depending on equipment) damage from the grenade itself, and you have 2049 damage.  Add in another 100 from the application of Pull for 2149, except for Possessed Collectors.  Remember

**Drell Assassin**

You need to get to that Capacity upgrade.  You're going to be carrying two weapons

**Fitness**

Maxed for melee.  If you went all for shields and health, and the equipment I describe below, your heavy melee does 1875 damage, which is enough to take out the health of several enemies by itself, and when paired with a Charge or Cluster Grenade, most of the other lower-tier enemies in the game.

## ***WEAPONS***

For what I think are obvious reasons

The secondary weapon is for dealing with heavier armored enemies.  Preferably, as it affords a very respectable DPS while keeping the CD at 180%.  I also used this build with the Kishock Harpoon Gun, but I found the one shot to be a little too unforgiving when dealing with some enemies (damn you Dragoons).  Other options are the Hurricane, Graal Spike Thrower, and GPS.  The cooldown on the latter two, as well as the Kishock, drops to 140%

## ***EQUIPMENT***

For Gear

For the Weapon Amp

For the Armor Module

For ammo, and Explosive).  If you feel like setting up tech combos, then Incendiary, Cryo, or Disruptor are all good.  I've been using Cryo for the extra security of keeping targets immobilized, and because it pairs perfectly with the Acolyte, as one shot = frozen enemy.  You could also go with AP or Warp if you feel like bumping the damage on your secondary weapon for bosses.  Or you could use nothing at all.

## ***GAMEPLAY***

I'm sure this will come as a shock, as all three of your powers stagger / immobilize your enemies.

Let's focus on the non-boss enemies

Scenario|Strategy / Combo|Enemies Killed|Notes
:---|:--:|:--:|:---
Lone unshielded enemy with health|Biotic Charge -&gt; Heavy Melee|All except Possessed Collectors|If Martial Artist is active
Lone shielded enemy|Acolyte shot -&gt; Biotic Charge -&gt; Heavy Melee|All except Pyros
Group of mixed (shielded / unshielded) enemies|Lift (unshielded target) -&gt; Cluster Grenade or Biotic Charge|All primary targets with health dead except Possessed Collectors, you can pull off a Charge
Group of shielded enemies|Acolyte Shot -&gt; Lift -&gt; Cluster Grenade or Biotic Charge|""""|""""
Possessed Collector Trooper|Acolyte Shot -&gt; Lift or Cluster Grenade -&gt; Biotic Charge -&gt; Heavy Melee|n/a|Alternatively could switch to backup weapon after stripping barriers
Possessed Collector Captain|Acolyte Shot -&gt; Lift -&gt; Biotic Charge -&gt; Heavy Melee|n/a|""""
Group of Dragoons|Switch to backup and keep your distance|n/a|Probably the biggest single weakness of this build
Scions / Brutes / Ravagers|Switch to backup|n/a|Consider finishing them off with a Biotic Charge and Heavy Melee for style points

That's a lot of information, and given that teammates may also be doing damage to these targets, some of these combinations may be overkill.

In terms of staying alive

## ***SUMMARY***

In case it's not obvious

Smash: This is your key power

Lash: 6 here as well

Passives: 4 here

Fitness: 6 here. Why not passives you ask? You're going to be up in the face of some of the nastiest enemies there are

Weapon: Acolyte. Because duh. Strip the shields of bosses so you can use smash to it's fullest potential. Extended mags and high-cal barrel. Also because duh.

Equipment: Shield Booster or Power Cells. The 825 barrier of this class won't cut it when you're getting up close and personal with baddies. For ammo I'm unsure as I don't know what works with the acolyte. Pistol Rail Amp for weapon bonus if you feel you need it.

There are also non-bug related conventions that many don't know about (the uselessness of AP mods on projectile weapons for one).



Some bugs that come to mind:

- Broken Rage power on Krogan Vanguard

- Paladin tech bursts centered on player

- SMG ULM still not working (caveat: unless player also equips a pistol with ULM)

- Energy Drain rank 6 armor boost evolution only works if player is hosting



Some general game mechanics and netcode issues people should know about:

- AP mods not applicable to projectile weapons (GPS

- Vanguard non-host glitch (most people know about this by now)

- Falcon/Striker non-host firing issue



Proposal:

Assuming there isn't already a resource like this out there already (I've been searching for a while but couldn't find anything current) I'd like to propose we set up a public Google doc listing any of the bugs and issues


The hope is that it will inform people of what power evolutions aren't working and therefore pointless to choose and other persistent bugs. I still cringe seeing a powers-based classes with an SMG using ULM join the lobby or someone using a GPS with an AP mod. And we could also test and confirm certain issues. For example, but it eventually came to light that it worked fine. Things like this could be addressed more quickly (hopefully) and used as a reference for anyone still wondering if something is working or not.


This is, so I thought this might be helpful for everyone (myself included).

I'll try to put together a Google doc in the next day or so with everything I know of and everything listed below, etc list them below and I'll add accordingly.

After a couple games messing around with the vanguard's powers, and two, that I really, really, hated smash. I don't care how good the perks you get from using smash are, the frame data on that move made it unusable for me. It has massive startup time, massive recovery time, no invincibility, if it's so slow that you can't safely or reliably hit someone with it without it whiffing or getting punished

So I started looking at his heavy melee move, fun playstyles I've used in this game so far. [Check it.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#54PAPOK[9@0)

The class I ended up with didn't miss smash at all. In fact, I knew I had a keeper. With a reegar X with blade attachment and shredder and the alliance training weight perks, you're sitting at 185% cooldown bonus. I played a bunch of games with it on silver and really, really liked how playing it felt; the playstyle felt much more unique than pretty much any other class I had played, being equally dependent on biotics, melee, and weapons instead of just specializing in one. After a while

So now, then charge to make your own biotic detonation, or lash to pull them close and finish off with a heavy melee to activate your fitness perks and go into hyper mode. Generally it's a good idea to detonate shielded enemies since you likely won't be able to pull them into melee range and try to yank unshielded enemies directly at you and heavy melee them as they're flying by. Once you start getting into the thick of battle, you won't use lash much since you need to keep your shields up, but it's a great round starter and also good for hack missions.

Now for the big 3: **Your charge is your force jump. Your dual whips from heavy melee are your lightsabers. Your reegar is your force lightning.** The bulk of your time spent in rounds will be up close and personal with the enemy. Charge, that way you'll already have boosted melee damage when you charge into a group and it will be easier to continue to rack up the melee kills and refresh your bonus. Enemies on gold won't all die in one melee or anything, but that's not the point. This is a sustainable cycle. Your area charge staggers, your heavy melee is so fast that it's finished almost exactly as the stagger ends, and your reegar can often re-stagger in the 1-2 seconds it takes your charge to finish cooling down. The reegar does massive damage as well and can actually be finishing off one or two enemies in the group on the first cycle.

So yeah, force lightning over and over, even on gold. The class is also an excellent phantom-slayer, but you have to be a little more careful about it. You can still charge them and stagger, but do not melee after. You'll open yourself up for an instakill. Instead, charge, roll backwards, swing their sword at you, charge them again

**Proxy Mine:** Used to stagger opponents and to apply damage buff.
Points go into 50% Impact Radius

**Hunter Mode:** This is why you're a glass cannon. While losing half your shields is not ideal

**Networked AI:** Skip it. Damage modifiers don't apply an additional buff to the cloak bonus.

**Advanced Hardware:** Fairly self explanatory. Grab all the melee damage modifiers. No point in getting shield upgrades if you're losing half of them to Hunter Mode.

**Weapons:** I recently went back to the Geth Plasma Shotgun for a couple reasons. You can get a full charge on the shotgun and then cloak with a full charge ready. Also you can still drop a proxy mine while staying cloaked and keeping the charge. Also while holding charge every time yuou use heavy melee the gun fires as the animation for melee begins

    -

**So how does it work?**

Luckily the concept behind the build is really simple. Engage hunter mode, cloak, drop a proxy mine at their feet and smash heavy melee till they're dead. Which for an unshielded enemy will be one hit, two for most things with shields and three for anything with armor (minus bosses). Though once you've killed something with heavy melee the bonus 75% melee damage and 30% power damage kick in, so you should be effectively one and two shorting anything on the map. And for bosses (I've mostly dealt with Geth Primes) you should be stripping away three bars of shields and two to three bars of armor per melee hit.

    -

**Tactics:**

Now this is the tricky part. Because of hunter mode you're already half down on shields. Also the Geth melee attack drains shields so it leaves you even more exposed. The idea is to get in and get out as fast as possible doing as much damage as possible. This takes a lot of practice to master. As stated above you're going to die a lot. It's ok. This is a high risk/high reward build.

The first thing you'll want to do is get inside. Being in wide open areas is dangerous as crossfire will kill you almost instantly. You want to make sure that you know where all the enemies currently active are at all times. Hunter mode helps greatly by letting you see through walls. This way you know where safe cover is at all times and where you next target is.

Choose your targets carefully. You don't want overly-large groups (more than 5) if at all possible. Single targets are, but because the Geth heavy melee is and area of effect attack and pulses this is not the most efficient way of killing everything in front of you. One is ok, three is ideal, and at most engage five.

For engaging you'll want to select a target and try to engage it in a way which allows you to get into cover quickly. At most you'll get two, run to your target and drop a Proxy mine. This will stagger them for a brief moment which will allow you to get a good angle of attack. Once you're in a good position hold start using heavy melee. This should stagger the enemies back farther and do massive damage to them. After two pulses they'll likely be dead.

Now you dodge back to cover, but it's a simple rotation. Cloak, proxy mine, 2 melee pulses, dodge to cover. Once you get back to cover the cooldown for cloak should be up, so just cloak again, rinse repeat.

    -

**Why play a melee based Infiltrator?**

Cause it's ridiculously fun. It's sort of like playing a Human Vanguard. You get right in the middle of the action and blow everything up, a very high risk build. Also I haven't had much experience on gold versus Reaper or Cerberus, though I'm going to be trying those out this weekend, so I'll let you guy know how it works out (cause it's a breeze vs Geth, you just have to watch out for Turrets and learn how to engage pyros correctly).

1334268054.0,s6w0k,PSA To all new Geth: Avenger vs. Geth Pulse Rifle vs. Armored targets,Craquehead,32,5,48,"**EDIT: April 17th - Today's multiplayer balance changes give the GPR around a 10% per-shot damage increase

TL;DR - The damage bonus you get for using Geth weapons on Geth characters does not make the Geth Pulse Rifle a good weapon for Silver or Gold matches.

Since Resurgence

Unfortunately, at least on Silver and above.

Let's look at the numbers

* Avenger X Burst DPS: 402
* GPR X Burst DPS: 411
* GPR X Burst DPS w/ Geth Bonus: 452

It looks like a no brainer, the picture changes quite a bit when you go up in difficulty and throw armor into the mix.

If you didn't know

* Bronze: 15 points
* Silver: 30 points
* Gold: 50 points

Adjusted for powers and mods like before

* Bronze: 35
* Silver: 20
* Gold: 5 (there is a minimum damage per shot of 5)

Because the GPR is low damage per shot

When comparing Burst DPS, even when factoring in the 10% geth damage boost. Values will be Avenger/GPR

* Bronze: 568/525
* Silver: 443/300
* Gold: 276/75

If you add an AP mod to your rifle

* Bronze: 649/671
* Silver: 605/593
* Gold: 547/488

I haven't factored in ammo powers, anyhow.

&gt;What's great about Dark Channel is how it affects the enemy: no matter what defenses they have (health, barriers), it'll drain that meter quickly and painfully. It also primes biotic explosions, which which makes it very dangerous for whoever's coated in that wonderful, purple cloud of t-shirt-into-gift-box pain. There's no impact damage, but it'll deal a consistent amount of damage over the course of 30 seconds (initially). Plus, if the targeted enemy dies, however).

&gt;Thing about the ""infectious"" properties of DC: it only works if an enemy is within 8 meters of the most recent victim of the attack. If nobody's close, you've probably had enough time to recharge since you last cast it.

&gt;
&gt;Those are two extreme cases, it's still only about 60% as effective as reported, and for a rough 'worst case' scenario, it's only 30% as effective. Even if you can squeeze out an effective 10% bonus from a damage gear, is that small boost worth more than all the benefits of the Geth Scanner?
&gt;
&gt;That said, some shield-stripping powers may need a little extra boost to make sure you can strip, for instance, a Phantom's shield in a single try. But, overall, I see very little benefit overall to using these gears compared to the benefits afforded by the Geth Scanner.
&gt;
&gt;At this point, Stronghold Package, and Armored Compartments. There are cases where I'll use others, but those four now make up more than 90% of my Gear usage.
&gt;
&gt;I will acknowledge that at low levels the Geth Scanner is less useful. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's a good option, especially if your other Gear isn't high level either.

There are multiple ways to reload cancel. The following ones are mostly well-known

- Sprinting or evading whike the reload animation plays.
- Using a power when the reload animation plays.
- using melee when the reload animation plays

There are some much better ways to reload cancel though:

- When your powers are cooling down and you can see the cooldown icon
- If the class you are playing as cannot evade
- After using a power like marksman

Now this won't be as long as the Venom Discussion

Basically a pocket Widow, that's a problem. However if there is a way to do a second attack after a shot, either by another Executioner shot or power, this weakness is mostly negated.

**Stats**

In the [weapons spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdHIwa081S0FBVS1ZZzdWeXRnbGRDYnc#gid=8)

*Similarities to the Carnifex*- The Executioner and Carnifex share the same weight

*Damage*- At X

*Single shot*- Because it is a single shot gun, Scorpion, or AP Talon instead.

*Penetration*- Like the Widow and Crusader

**Mods and Ammo**

*Magazine Capacity*- Unless you are using an N7 Destroyer with DM

*High-Caliber Barrel, but it's understandable if you can't get them because of its accuracy out of cover.

*Melee Stunner, but not the gun itself per se.

*Pistol ULM

*Scope*- I'm not a fan of Pistol Scopes but if you feel that the scope makes you a better shot

*Ammo*- A matter of personal opinion, and the ability to prime for a Tech Burst. Alternatives include Incendiary Ammo for the DoT and Fire Explosion, Phasic Ammo for pure anti-shield ability, and Warp for being just a high damaging ammo type.

**Tips and Tricks**

*Aim true*- Given that it is a single shot weapon, so there's no reason to make sure you hit. On that note, keep in mind that Executioner goes from mildly accurate to laser accurate when going into cover.

*One-two punch*- Since it can't one-shot enemies at higher difficulty, you can fire two shots quite rapidly. The only issue is that you have to have decent recoil control to get the second shot off in a decent time frame. The other method I suggest is combining a shot with a power. For example, consider shooting a Disruptor Ammo shot at a mook and following it up with a Throw. You'll get rid of the shields with the shot and the Throw will both ragdoll the mook and detonate a Tech Burst. Other good powers to combine with the Executioner include Warp (with Incendiary Ammo), Ballistic Blades, and Concussive Shot.

*SNARL*- More fun than anything else

**Conclusion**

This isn't a 'one shot, one kill' weapon. Not the strongest pistol in a player's armory, but the Executioner fills its role nicely as a high-risk, high reward hand cannon.

You ever tank before?  Nah.  You haven't.  At least you haven't tanked until you tank as a Geth Juggernaut.  You haven't felt the aggro till you've aggro'd as a Geth Juggernaut.  Your job is to lumber your fine ass in there, shoot at some more stuff, and then heavy melee everything in sight again.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat. Juggy here can solo Silver like it ain't nothing.  It turns it into a class A joke.  Gold soloing I can't evaluate but when you are in a team, Mr. Juggy here fits right in.  This is Gold.  On easy mode. Come on, bros. Fight me.

1358081721.0,16hmyk,ME3 Co-op College Races 107: Volus,smellycatjazz,28,3,16,"**Overview**

The addition and application of the Volus race has been quite controversial. They have largely been written off as pure support classes

Base Health and Shields: 150/500

**Abilities**

*Volus Training*

All Volus have 30% Shield Boost in Evolution 4 of their passive instead of the 20% headshot bonus. This deters many from trying to turn a Volus into a pure weapon platform

*Melee*

The Volus melee had two very useful features.

*The light melee acts as a tactical cloak of the sort. Although it lacks the bonuses of the Infiltrator Cloak

*The heavy melee acts as a shell

*Biotic Orbs*

&gt;Summon 3 orbs to float around you. Use it again to launch an orb at a target. Each orb increases your recharge speed by 10%. Highly effective against armor and barriers.

Biotic Orbs act as a workaround to the Volus poor weight capacity. The bonus applies as such

base value of a power

/

1 + cooldown bonus + recharge bonuses + Biotic Orbs

Evolution 4 in orbs offer an option to increase recharge by an additional 5% per Orb

Evolution 5 expose evolution is what makes Biotic Orbs a great team asset. If the Volus is willing and capable

*Recon Mine*

&gt;Launch a mine that sticks to the first surface out touches and arms after a brief delay [3s]. The mine scans the area for enemies to provide a tactical overlay

Recon Mines is easily one of the most useful powers in the game. Not only does it work as a ""team-Tactical Scan"" with it's wall-hacking nature, capping at 25%.

*Shield Booster*

&gt;Repair your shields and nearby allies

This power and the lack of blatant offensive moves suggest the Volus is made for purely support. Shield Booster is a extremely useful power. It obviously replenishes shields, and finally a second of invincibility when it's cast. Having this ability helps with overall survivability of not only you, but the whole team.

*Other Powers*

*Proximity Mine (exceptional debuffer and detonator)

*Stasis (trap any non-armored target in it's place. Targets will only be released if excessive.force is done to health or it times out)

*Decoy+

*Combat Drone+

*Biotic Charge+

+ - should already be acquainted with this powers by now

**Kits and ways to make then offensive**

Here's where we straddle the line of disagreement. Several will opt for pure support

*Adept*

Stasis

Stasis is actually the most useful power into transforming the Volus Adept into an offensive character. The simplest way would to a Stasis-headshot build

The only way to work around this and maintain a respectable cooldown is to use the Paladin or Graal Spike Thower. The Paladin poses issues since it gets trapped in shield gate and can't one shot most shielded targets, so something has to be sacrificed. Stacking bonuses which, if not planned correctly, will cause enemies to fall from Stasis and live. Ammo powers like Warp are prefect. You can one shot shields, and the warp bonus kicks in vs health (also on Phantom's barriers), but math is still necessary for the optimal setup.

If math isn't your thing then use a Spike Thrower and capitalize on the 3x headshot multiplier or go single target damage with Vulnerability in Rank 6. 

Skipping Stasis entirely and focusing on tanking your character

Take debuffing Orbs for boss slaying.

*Engineer*

Recon Mine

This is a debuffing superstar. Just like classes with Biotic Orbs

*Sentinel*

Decoy

The lack of a power with a lengthy cooldown opens up this guy for heavier weapons. The most successful Sentinels I've seen concentrate in misdirection. Using the Combat Drone and Decoy to sucker enemies in

*Vanguard*

Biotic Orbs

Biotic Orbs are actually the what sets this apart from other Vanguards. He has the quick Charge, this sets up the next Charge to hit even harder. Just keep in mind the debuff is only 6s.

**Build** [**N**]( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AsariJusticar/RPQFF/Acolyte10BA5AJ5/CerberusHarrier8AE5AF5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/AssaultRifleAmp5/) - [**K**](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#15!1B05515!2301595!242513!GEF55)

*Biotic Bubble*

* Radius - This makes it much easier to get bosses inside the bubble.
* Enemy weakness - This is what makes the justicar good.
* Warp Effect - This allows combos between the bubble and reave. This is what makes the justicar awesome.

*Reave*

* Radius - Duh. This is what turns this ability from awful to awesome
* Damage Reduction  - This one is very debatable and mostly depends on what level your harrier is.
* Damage&amp;Duration - The utility of this one is just too good to pass up on for a little more damage. 

*Pull*

* Radius - This one is pretty obvious too. Duration does nothing
* Expose -  Lift damage is useless
* Duration&amp;combos - Obviously.

Now so far

*Asari Justicar*

* Duration&amp;Capacity. You need the extra carry weight to use the harrier.

*Fitness*

* Durability.

I also considered  6/6/6/5/3. 

The reason I decided against this is that, but according to peddroelmz's thread on the bsn it’s still broken (might just be out of date though). 

Second reason: Even if it works

I think the extra shields are more useful than that. 

*(For continuity's sake

---  
  
**Weapons**

Well I kind of made it obvious already. Harrier and acolyte.   
The sweet

Sadly this kind of requires a level V+ Harrier to get the most out of the build. I actually debated if it was even worth to make a post on this build because well

Alas

And there are several options to compensate for a lower level harrier. Pull and bubble have really short cooldowns, you can take the recharge evolution. Missing out on 10% damage reduction isn't that big of a deal. 

If you don't have a harrier

Firstly, the mattock. On paper this is basically the same gun as the harrier.   
Problem is that no human being can actually click 450 times per minute consistently.  If you can come close without breaking your finger

The other option is the hurricane. It's light-weight, the inaccuracy and the recoil isn't that big of a deal. 

Another great weapon you can use is the wraith. It's lighter than the harrier and offers similar damage output. Also
This also applies for the hurricane.

As for weapon mods

On the harrier and mattock take any combination of extended barrel

For the hurricane I take the high velocity barrel (or extended barrel with ap ammo) and recoil system. Heat sink is fine too.

---

**Gameplay**

Because I didn't want to create the mother of all walls of texts (see how that worked out...)

[VIDEO](http://youtu.be/wUOQbGWcmDQ)

*I’m sorry about the quality

*There are time-links in the description so you can skip around easily and don't have to watch the entire thing.* 

The Acolyte + pull + reave combo is incredibly good and I would go so far as to say that it is the best biotic option to take out mooks. Well

Thanks to the aoe nature of all three parts of the combo

A couple words about reave: The dps stat may seem pretty minuscule

    130*9=1170 against health
    130*1
    130*2*9=2340 against barriers
    130*0

Now imagine you hit a spawn with two banshees and two brutes. You just did 8200 fucking damage with a single spell. Provided nobody kills anything before reave runs out of course. 

Now for the thing that turns the justicar from any class with the harrier to an awesome class with the harrier. The bubble.

The debuff from the bubble is completely multiplicative with weapon damage

A *cloaked* fully decked out 4/6/6/6/4 geth infiltrator (+gear, math for this is in the math post somewhere below). 

Getting the boss you want to kill actually in the bubble is probably the hardest part about playing the justicar with this build though.

As you can see in the video, or ahead of the bosses so they walk into it.  

Maps aren’t all born equal for this either. On maps like giant, Vancouver, rio or condor (fuck condor) are much harder because there are so many places the enemies can come from. 

Sadly the bubble has some kind of cooldown before it primes a target for detonation again. In my experience
(Especially on gold it happens quite often that two bosses are following each other closely. You can use this to your advantage here.)

For console users it might be interesting that

---

Now

**Cerberus**

This is probably the faction the justicar is best against outside of a solo environment. 

Atlases are the easiest boss to keep in the bubble. Phantoms are pretty easy to deal with thanks to the acolyte and pull. 

A dragoon can be killed with one acolyte shot and a bubble + reave detonation.  Will usually mostly kill the other dragoons standing next to him as well.

Cerberus really doesn't have anything the justicar doesn't have an answer to. 

**Reaper**

Banshees are a bit of a pain to keep in the bubble. But thanks to the acolyte you can get rid of the barriers really quickly and hopefully you’ll be able to kill her before she starts teleporting again. 

Brutes can mess you up as well

Ravagers pretty much hit the one weakness of the justicar. Armored targets that don't come close to you and that you can’t engage safely at close range. Just use the harrier for them.

**Collectors**

Probably the worst faction for the justicar. But hell

As far as I can tell though, I wouldn't really recommend playing any biotic against them. 

On the plus side

Apart from that

---

**Class Synergy**

There isn't really much to say about this.  
Incredible mook killing skills, a sweet aoe debuff and very solid dps against bosses. The justicar is good at everything and will do fine on any team.

There are two class combos that I want to give a special shout-out though: 

First is the Justicar with a phoenix class.   
They just work amazingly well together. A target in the bubble will take absolutely ridiculous damage from smash and the phoenix doesn't have to worry about setting up his own biotic explosions. 

Second is the Justicar and the valkyrie.  
Debuffs over debuffs. 25% damage increase from the bubble
Plus all the dot effects from reave

1351392449.0,127b5q,The Elemental (Krogan Sentinel),RepublicanShredder,32,6,15,"**Preface**

Midterm season is now in full effect, I typically panic.

**Introduction**

If you are familiar with Battletech fiction (you probably know it from the *MechWarrior* series of games), they wipe the floor like a diligent janitor at a well-funded hospital.

The Krogan Sentinel is not that far off from the description. The Krogan are a race whose main occupation is combat. Nearly everything they have is tailored with that in mind. On top of that, high damaging Lift Grenades, and large encumbrance capacity allow the [Krogan Sentinel to literally be a tank on foot.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#32PDLIRI5%400FE%40%40D4C4%400%400)

Do note that build style is very similar to Interweb Ninja's [Max McTankerson](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/yxsu6/max_mctankerson_krogan_sentinel_build/)

**Passives**

Gotta have them Shields and Power Damage

**Tech Armor**

Since everyone loves Damage Reduction and Power Damage

As far as usage is concerned, as its passive bonuses are quite useful.

**Incinerate**

So it looks like someone just threw a scrambled note at me. Oh good grief

Ok, as it is not competing with Tech Armor for cooldowns most of the time.

The second main use for this power is to use it while running towards a target. Incinerate shoots a fire and forget plasma bolt

Finally, Incendiary), then you can make your own Tech Explosions. Lift Grenades have a real problem with detonating, and are often overkill when they can detonate.

Incinerate is also pretty good vs armor

**Lift Grenades**

Probably my favorite (and most important

The main issue with Lift Grenades is that they don't detonate very well. The only time I have seen them detonate is when the target is biotically primed and has only Health remaining. In addition to being very specific

Still

**Weaponry**

Dang

So, if need be. So don't equip a Javelin and Typhoon haphazardly. Try to keep the cooldown above 50% or so as a rule of thumb.

Instead, Saber, Valkyrie (a new favorite, I might add), Graal Spike Thrower, Paladin, Crusader, but do take into account their weight so that you aren't put into an awkward spot where you really need that Tech Armor explosion but then get shish kabbobed by a sneaky Phantom.

This kit is one of those kits I rarely see, multifaceted, massive (as smakl LOVES pointing out), and mighty, the Krogan Sentinel is a great team tank.

1339184955.0,us29p,ME3 stats: How many packs/credits/hours does it take to collect all the rare weapons up to level 10,lanzer,31,5,39,"Just did some simple math to answer the question:

Just how many packs do I need to buy in order to get level 10 on all the rare weapons?

Summary:

- It takes about 170 premium spectre packs to complete all rare weapons

- which equates to 16.8 million credits

- which is about 240 gold matches

- or 120 hours of gameplay at 30 minutes per game

Assumption:

With 16 weapons and 18 characters available as rare items in the spectre packs, you can potentially boost your tries down to 320 tries or less.  340 sounds like I just multiplied 34 by 10, but that number actually came from the assumption that character cards never max out, and the available cards drop by 1 when you maxes out a weapon.  Just to confirm, I even wrote a program to simulate opening of PSP until everything's level 10.



Of course, number of mission failures, equipment pack purchases and luck, and the number of rares exist before the expansion packs.  But it kind of give an overall feel of how much effort you need to reach the point of those N7 500+ players that seem to have the Krysae rifle at level 10.

Other unknowns are whether different weapons have different rarity rates.  I don't think so

As a side note: on average the chance of getting a specific character or weapon that you want is 1/34, you either need to play 24 games of gold, or pay EA $35 bucks for 17 premium packs. (assuming you haven't maxed out all weapons)

-I think it would be cool if on waves when you need to hack the console(camp around it) one person could actually use the console to increase the hacking speed. The person would have to be standing up at the console so they would be a big target and they obviously would not be able to help hold off enemies.

-On the waves where you need to kill certain targets the enemies could basically defend the targe. It would make waves where one of the big units like a banshee or a prime really hard


**Added:**

-Retrieval: Adding optional objectives could be awesome too. Maybe during any objective wave some resources could spawn in the area. A player can then run and pick them up and carry them back to the landing zone for bonus credits or xp. The trick would come in that once carrying the item the player could no longer defend themselves and the enemies would try to get to the resources first to destroy them so you have to hurry to get them first. (This would also be very cool as a bonus to the extraction wave.)

-Squad: I was thinking of what would be a cool new objective wave and decided it would be cool if elite squads could show up. Basically what would happen is instead of random enemies spawning a squad of 5-10 enemies would spawn. When I say squad I mean they would have better AI and would help each other. So they would use cover better than the normal enemies

-Bomb: Another new objective wave could be planting a bomb(or something similair) where the players need to pick a bomb up at the LZ and carry it to an are where they have to plant and arm the bomb. This has 2 ways it could be implemented

-Civilians: In these waves players would need to either find and escort civilians to the LZ or the players would need to revive civilians and escort them to the LZ. This objective would also work as either a bonus wave or instead of getting a time bonus you would get a bonus for rescuing more civilians than neccesary. (Again this would work well with an extracion wave. Giving you a time limit at the same time.)

-Bonus Wave: These waves would just be bonus waves. Players would have a huge advantage in these waves (something like increased health/damage or they all get heavy weapons from SP)

-Surprise Attack: I've talked about this one being an option for a game mode but I think it would work as a surprise objective. In this one a race other than the current type would surprise you and fight you and the enemies. So for example you would be fighting the geth and cerberus troops would begin dropping in and fighting you and the geth. In this situation each enemy would spawn less than normal units for the wave (for example each would spawn 75% of a normal wave) this is to keep from having to fight an absurd number of enemies as they would also be killing each other.

-Assasination: This would be the opposite of the targeted enemy waves. In these waves one player would be chosen and all the enemies would be trying to kill that player. They would not ignore the other players but they would focus on trying to kill the marked target.

I mic up and tell the quarians to stop wasting time reviving the vanguard and he drops. Wave 8 goes more smoothly, but I have to run back and revive both of them as a rocket trooper flanked. Wave 10 we run for comm relays, losing one of the infiltrators to connection issues. I end up getting all 4 relays with the help of a medigel. Wave 11, where the ladder comes up.

I had heard that there was a number of others who had completed this daring mission

But I could do this. 

""5 minutes to dropoff."" The pilot's words echoed in my head

I did one last rundown of my gear, my mags were loaded up. I was as prepared as I could be. 

I could do this. 

As the pilot took of with the shuttle, it was here that I got my first start. I know this map better than anyone.

Not 20 seconds after touching down, so I shut him up by ripping him apart. Unfortunately, the entire compound heard the explosion. 

The game was on. 

Troves of Cerberus fell before me as I was well versed in their tactics. It took me awhile to take down the last Atlus before my comms started picking up a transmission from command. Apparently

As I make my way through another wave of Cerberus cronies

After snaking my way through, it was almost down. A quick shockwave to detonate what I had already set up and on to the next target. 

The rest of the targets went down quickly enough, slamming my fist on the reactor vent activators. I smiled as I heard the hiss of the closing doors, but the the troves of enemies in front of me quickly dashed those away. 

This would be a long fight.

The Reapers finally had shown up. Right as I'm having to hack into a goddamn mainframe or some bullshit, making contact, smashing me into a wall. The area's getting crowded, but I only have a few more seconds to finish. 

Not enough it seems, knowing I only have a few minutes before that data is lost and my entire mission will be for naught.

I get to the other side of the reactor and hunker down. I don't have to make a stand, making sure they go down quickly as possible. I have about 15 seconds of hacking left and about a minute to do it in. I haul ass back to the terminal and finish up. As it's being uploaded, three banshees are on me. Where the hell did they come from?! I dodge their sweeping grabs and make a beeline for a spot of cover. I fire of everything I have in their direction, not taking my focus off them for a second. Suddenly, a missle hits me in the back. Fuck! I hadn't paid attention to the eight billion other things. I had one medpack left. I couldn't waste it. I scampered out of cover taking out mooks as I hurried the hell out of that corridor. 

""Get to the LZ, and took out the approaching wave of baddies. It seemed like an eternity, but the second that shuttle was in reach, I jumped in. I threw out the last of what I had, and immediately passed out.

So I chose to divide this into 3 sections. The first is **Pregame Knowledge**, mental preparation, and social aspects (protip: bring friends). The second section is **Lobby Knowledge**, which will cover map and enemy compositions along with team power interactions. In particular, I plan to spend some time discussing how kits can mesh together to play effectively as a team with regards to powersets. The final section will be **In-Game Knowledge**, regarding how to play once at a firebase. InterwebNinja already covered a good portion of it with his Transition to Gold, but there are a few tips that are much more important on Platinum than on Gold. In each of these sections, but video recording tends to hate me. On the plus side

So now for a more detailed summary. Keep in mind that this is a rough outline and not the final product yet. I hope to have a final product by Sunday

___________________________________________________________

**Pregame Knowledge**

So you think you're ready for Platinum? Before you hop into a lobby you should check some things off:

* Is Platinum right for you? If it's just for the credits you can just roll with 3 friends for Glacier Cobra farming.

* There's a small gear check you need to pass. Even a Level 20 Geth Infiltrator will have problems without good equipment backing him up. Don't skimp out on consumable equipment when playing Platinum

* In addition to a basic gear check

* Is your build up to snuff? Consider how effective it is against [different enemy types](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/zwxzi/the_definitively_not_definitive_guide_to_guides/) and ask what is its role. The [Big Bad List of Builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/wiki/bigbadlistofbuilds) can help with that. Ask yourself why your build is effective on Platinum.

* Related to the above point

* A special mention to the three ""crutch"" kits: AIU

* Are you willing to risk playing with Platinum PUGs? Most of the time they go well but co-ordinating with teammates generally yields better results. Consider using meetup threads and userlists to find other players to play with you.

________________________________________

**Lobby Knowledge**

* Are you ready to face every enemy? Do you have a good idea on what enemy spawns in which wave? Are you prepared for Geth on Wave 6 of a Cerberus Platinum game? Can you handle the onslaught of Dragoons and Geth Hunters during Cerberus Extraction?

* Do you understand how the wave budget system works? Knowing how it works lets one plow through a game in record time.

* Can you handle the map present? Some maps are good for grenade kits given their massive grenade supplies while others are practically dry for grenades. In particular

* Now with that out of the way

* Speaking of Power Combos

__________________________________________

**In Game Knowledge**

* Now the rubber hits the floor. How much are you willing to risk to get the job done? Sometimes it's fine to take your sweet time but during objective waves time is of the essence. No need to burn equipment outside of objective waves unless the circumstances demand it.

* Don't die and kill stuff. Captain Obvious had to say that.

* Do you notice something that can help/hinder your team? For example

* Look at how your teammates play. Reasonably predicting how a teammate plays can help you formulate a plan to keep him/her alive.

* Perhaps you notice something a teammate is doing that's really cool

* DPS is the most important aspect in Platinum. Sure staying alive helps with the DPS

The powers are the same as /u/spark2 's [build](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19rgd6/this_chick_is_caballin_cabal_vanguard_build/)

***

The key to sniping is killing stuff at range before it gets too close for your ridiculously large gun to target.  Obvious, and they all serve a different purpose.  

* The first is **Poison Strike**.  This is not Biotic Charge, however, the most mobile power in the game.  You can hop up to sniper perches, teleport through walls, play matador with a Brute's charge, and escape from pretty much any hairy situation.  As such, the range evolution is as far as I go.

* The second panic button is **Nightshade Blades**.  One reason I end up on the floor when I typically play snipers is drawing a sidearm is too damn slow.  By the time my hurricane is ready to fire, then headshot (or bravely run away).  Since this is a grenade power, you can teleport away if you're feeling fancy.  The 6th evolution for exploding blades gives you a second stagger if you need it, but feel free to take damage if you're using offense as a defense.

* This brings us to the third panic button, banshee cancer, swarmer stings, and ravager puddles.  It restores your barriers, gives damage resistance, and higher move speed, all for 20 seconds on a &lt;4s cooldown.  You should pretty much use this whenever you get shot.  This power will let you keep firing, and firing.

Which brings us to the butter of this build's bread.  **The N7 Valiant**.  I've been blessed by the RNG, it has a forgiving 3-shot clip, and with the Turian passives it has *almost zero recoil*.  The reload animation is very fast, so you don't need to reload cancel if that's not your thing.  And with Biotic Focus, you can stay out of cover longer to lay down the hurt.  This gun chews through mooks and bosses alike, and has almost no downside.

One nice aspect of this build is it is not reliant on any particular consumable.  AP ammo is probably the best for random teams, you really don't need it) benefits her to some degree.  For gear, I'd use grenade capacity if I had it, otherwise just use a Sniper amp.

**Conclusion**

This build is gold-viable and a very well balanced sniper kit for those of us who can't manage the l33t javelol wallhax.  If you've always wanted to play a sniper but always seem to die in a panic

**Biotic Charge** - We're stopping at Rank 4 for the Radius evolution. In this build

**Stasis** - Level this power all the way to Rank 6 for skull-blasting goodness. At Rank 4 you want Duration, pick Recharge Speed over Bonus Power. We're playing as a weapons class, and I prefer consistency to the stress of gambling with the RNG. At Rank 6, Bubble is your best friend.

**Asari Adept** - All 6 levels of the racial ability, but 5 and 6 are not optional.

**Fitness** - Take it to Rank 4 Durability. If interested

**Kishock Harpoon Gun** This is your money-maker. The talent calculator is telling me the damage is 1, and Mods. You can (should) charge up your shots to boost that damage further, assuming it's not already factored into the calculator. Aim for the head, because you get a gorgeous 3x headshot multiplier. It's a projectile weapon so it ignores shield gates and armor reduction. You can hip-fire with zero sniper rifle damage penalty. The first 2/3s of the damage are immediate, and the rest is applied as a damage-over-time (very short duration) which helps delay enemy shield/barrier recharge.

For the negatives, [Console](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19s44r/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_reload/)). Since it is a projectile weapon, anything that is not stasis'd might be difficult to hit due to travel time of the shot, especially if you are playing off-host. There is a slight downward arc to each shot that can be reduced by charging up the weapon. 

**Weapon Mods** Extended Barrel (+damage) and Enhanced Scope (see through smoke) is my preferred loadout. Centurions and Atlases love to thwart your line-of-sight to Stasis Bubble with smoke grenades. If smoke doesn't bother you or you know the enemy faction ahead of time

**Hurricane** Optional but highly recommended if you are playing against random enemies. Unless you are incredibly clutch at hitting fast movers

---

**Gear and Equipment**

For the permanent gear slot

For equipment

Top choices for ammo are Incendiary, Warp, Cryo, and Disruptor will allow you to prime bosses for power combos, and apply secondary debuffs. Phasic is excellent for blasting through boss shields and barriers (10x damage multiplier!), but if any teammates are using Acolyte pistols you'll get more mileage from a priming ammo type. Avoid Explosive, because it can break the Stasis of other enemies caught in your bubble. If you're desperate, but you won't benefit from the cover penetration and armor piercing properties.

---

**Strategy**

Find a safe, recharge your shields, avoid boss attacks, and stagger/knock down enemies that get too close. Note that you can charge up your Kishock before a Biotic Charge, release the trigger mid-flight, and the gun will fire directly into center-of-mass. Useful for guaranteeing a mook's demise if you're unsure Biotic Charge can get the job done. When dealing with bosses, you should try for headshots if you can manage

Summary of mechanics  
- If host characters hit the bubble with a hitscan weapon (piercing is unnecessary)
- If off-host characters hit the bubble with a hitscan weapon
- In all cases
- Approximately 2m worth of penetration is required to double hit the phantom reliably with a headshot. One shot can hit the bubble along with the phantom’s body.  
- For double hit consistency
- Ammo damage applies twice on double hits.  
- Ammo damage applies normally (as though the phantom's body was hit) when the bubble is hit. This is the same for both hosts and off-host shooters.

vs Banshees  
Banshees can also be double-hit if they are in their power blocking effect.
The mechanics are similar to the phantom except that host shots on the bubble will not inflict direct armour damage.

In the process of reviewing a lot of builds in the BBLoBs, but I thought it would be helpful to make a post dedicated to them.  This has been one of my favorite classes since the game was released and I still play it regularly.  I recommend you give it another shot if you haven't played it recently.

####BUILD

Build 1, this is somewhat similar to [RepublicanShredder's Lord of Tech Bursts build](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/ygcwa/lord_of_the_tech_bursts_human_engineer/), with the exception of some extra points in Fitness and some more playstyle considerations that I'll cover below.  Probably a more common alternative to this 'classic' would be a 6/6/6/4/4, but they're both pretty similar.

Alternatively

####POWERS

***Overload:***  This is a fairly standard Overload spec.  By taking Neural Shock in Evolution 5 and Shield Damage in Evolution 6, while still hitting two targets (applies to shields / barriers).  These are must-have evolutions on this class, IMO.  With the specific loadouts I've linked, Overload will do enough damage to take out the Shields / Barriers of every enemy in the game on Gold except for Phantoms, Hunters, and Pyros.

***Incinerate:***  This is maxed for armor damage.  I see little reason to take Radius on this power, it does 75% of its damage upfront, and then another 25% as a 3 second DoT.  If you take Armor Damage, as I've done here, you will add another 50% multiplicative damage bonus that is an 8 second DoT.   With the loadouts I've linked, that means you will do about 1600 damage against armor within the first 3 seconds, and about 2000 total damage after the full eight seconds.  

One other thing to note is that if you want to dedicate one of your two Human Engineer classes to using Cryo Ammo

***Passive:*** This is just to max the Power Damage of Overload and Incinerate.  You could take the Weapon Damage in Evolution 6

***Combat Drone:*** This is where the two builds diverge.  Build 1 is your classic crowd control drone build.  Excellent for staggering groups of lower-tier enemies.  Build 2 is meant as more of a distraction for heavy enemies like Primes or Atlases.  Note, and Husks now ignore the Combat Drone.

***Fitness:*** Build 2 just invests in extra durability over the Combat Drone.  As a result, where lower-tier crowd control isn't as helpful.

####PLAYSTYLE

With Build 1, so you should be able to follow up with a quick Overload to strip shields, and then finish off with weapons fire / mixed powers as necessary.  Note, it's generally not worth detonating a Tech Burst using Incinerate.  A 6+6 Tech Burst actually does less shield / barrier damage than a single cast of Overload.  The Tech Burst will yield a slightly higher damage against Health, so situationally, it might offer a small benefit.  I just never bother.

With Build 2, if being approached from the flank, I may quickly cast it to distract an enemy while addressing other ones that are a more imminent threat.  This strategy is valid with Build 1 as well.

With either build, out of habit, I often launch it regardless).  Against a shielded enemy, I Overload / weapons fire until shields are stripped.  Then when the enemy is down to armor, I alternate, in order, Incinerate and Overload for Fire Explosions, you'll be doing close to 4000 of anti-armor damage damage per cycle

####WEAPONS

I like something with medium burst damage for this class.  Too much burst damage on a class with Overload is wasted, I prefer pistols on this class.  Paladin is great at decent ranges, and Talon is another alternative, though its shield-stripping bonuses are somewhat wasted when you have a power like Overload.  Paladin is probably my #1 choice, and it's what I have included in the build links.  I'd also consider the Carnifex, Mattock, or even Indra.

####EQUIPMENT

The base human classes are a little flimsy, I think the main choice comes down to whether you want to use a Power Amplifier or a Cyclonic Modulator.  Using a Power Amp IV can get you over that Gold Phantom barrier threshold.  And, Incinerate will do noticeably more damage against armor.  So, your choice... survivability, or damage?  I tend to favor the former.

As for ammo types, I'd probably just keep it simple with AP Ammo.  Especially with the Paladin, where I think you have to use the Heavy Barrel and Extended Mag.  Trying to slot Guardians without any AP ability can be tedious.

Give the Human Engineers another shot.  I never see anyone using them,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1372236778.0,,PS3,t3_1a7efg

*Weapon Availability*: Available on all weapons. Pistols have a stronger version that adds weight and has the same conflicts.

*Conflicts*:  Some versions of Piercing

*Applications*: Increased damage is one of the most standard modifications for guns. Nearly every gun will benefit greatly from simply dealing more damage. When in doubt

**PIERCING**

*Effect*: Ignores armour DR by a percentage

*Weapon Availability*: Available on all weapons. ARs have a stronger variant that adds weight and conflicts with Damage Increase.

*Conflicts*: SMG version conflicts with Damage Increase

*Applications*: After damage, and ARs for maximum damage. Cover penetration is also useful, especially on maps with lots of thin cover and Cerberus or with weapons that come with innate cover piercing. However, this mod has no use whatsoever on projectile weapons.

**DAMAGE/PIERCING HYBRID**

*Effect*: Combines the effects of the Damage Increase and Piercing mods

*Weapon Availability*: Shotguns

*Conflicts*: Damage increase

*Applications*: Being able to have both Damage and Piercing at the same time often offers a significant increase in overall damage output

**WEIGHT REDUCTION**

*Effect*: Reduces the weapon's weight by a percentage

*Weapon Availability*: Available on all weapons.

*Conflicts*: SMG version conflicts with Stability

*Applications:* Reducing the weight of a weapon can make it more suitable on certain classes that need high CDR bonus. It may even allow for feasible carrying of two weapons without heavily impacting cooldowns. However

**MAGAZINE SIZE INCREASE**

*Effect*: Increases the capacity of a weapon's magazine by a percentage.

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs

*Conflicts*: AR version conflicts with weight reduction. 

*Applications:* This mod is good on weapons that either have a significant reload times, or some combination of all three. For some weapons it can make a large impact in overall usability of the weapon whereas for others it comes down to user preference. Keep in mind that each magazine will consume a larger portion of reserve ammunition. For ""cooldown"" weapons like the Lancer and ramp up weapons like the Typhoon, this mod is extremely powerful.

**SPARE AMMUNITION**

*Effect*: Increases the reserve ammunition capacity for a weapon by a percentage.

*Weapon Availability*: SRs

*Conflicts*: No conflicts

*Applications*: This mod generally comes down to user preference. Only a few select weapons actually have reserve ammunition issues and ammo crates are usually easy for players to find. It is important to note that this mod does not work on any ""cooldown"" weapons like the Lancer.

**MELEE DAMAGE INCREASE**

*Effect*: While the weapon is out

*Weapon Availability*: Pistols, but adds weight.

*Conflicts*: Melee mods cannot be stacked on the same weapon

*Applications*: Use of this mod should be fairly straightforward. Equip on weapons for melee-centric builds. Due to the multiplicative nature of the bonus

**SCOPE**

*Effect*: Changes the zoom fire of a gun to use a magnifying scope. In addition, but will not change magnification.

*Weapon Availability*: Pistols

*Conflicts*: Power Damage Increase

*Applications*: Having a scope on non-scoped weapons is often user preference. The increased accuracy and ability to engage targets from further away is a trade off for other possibilities. For pistols

**STABILIZER**

*Effect*: Reduces the recoil (distance that a player's reticule jumps each shot) for a weapon by a percentage

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs

*Conflicts*: Reduced Weight on SMGs

*Applications*: Some SMGs and ARs have a significant RoF

**POWER DAMAGE INCREASE**

*Effect*: While the weapon is out

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs

*Conflicts*: Scopes

*Applications*: Players who rely more on powers than weapons for doling out damage will favour this mod. However

---

*The last three mods will be referred to by their names since they are unique and are better recognized when called as such*

**HEAT SINK**

*Effect*: Each shot fired has a chance to not consume ammunition

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs only

*Conflicts*: None

*Applications*: In all cases except the Collector SMG, users will be able to keep up the fire for an impressive amount of time. 

As mentioned earlier

**SMART CHOKE**

*Effect*: Increases accuracy by a significant percentage

*Weapon Availability*: Shotguns only

*Conflicts*: Reduced Weight

*Applications*: The smart choke is one of the most potent shotgun mods. One of the main issues with many shotguns is they are extremely inaccurate and spread their  shots over a fairly wide area, making some shotguns usable from more comfortable distances while allowing others to essentially snipe targets at medium long ranges.

It is worth noting that the projectile shotguns gain very little benefit

**CRANIAL TRAUMA SYSTEM**

*Effect*: Increases damage dealt headshots by a large amount. Additive bonus

*Weapon Availability*: Pistols only

*Conflicts*: Damage

*Applications*: This is a nifty mod that essentially acts as the heavy damage increase mod

Everything works.

Use a shotgun omniblade.

Thanks to peddro for the help. No thanks to Origin.

--------------------------------------------------

***Formula:***

**Melee damage (including hammer)**

base_melee * defence_multiplier * (1 + sum_melee) * melee_weapon_mod

**biotic/electrical hammer**

base_damage * defence_multiplier * multiplier bonus * (1 + sum_power) * melee_weapon_mod

**base damages**

* light melee: 360
* last 3-combo hit: 720
* krogan heavy melee/hammer: 675
* electrical hammer: 250
* biotic hammer: 750

**defence multipliers**

* light melee/ hammer: 100% to all
* last 3-combo hit/ krogan heavy melee: 75% to armour
* last 3-combo hit (enchanted): 100% to all
* electrical hammer: 300% to shields &amp; barriers
* biotic hammer: 150% armour &amp; barriers

**multiplier bonuses:**

* biotic hammer: 50% bonus to armour evo (5B) gives 1.75x
* electrical hammer: 75% bonus to shields and barriers (4A) gives 1.75x

--------------------------------------------------

***sample calculations:***

**sample warlord**

* tech armour: DR/ power bonus (30%)
* biotic hammer: damage/ armour
* electrical hammer: S&amp;B damage/ chill/ radius &amp; combo
* rage: all melee
* strength enhancer III
* power amplifier IV
* shotgun omniblade V
* juggernaut shield V

----------

***tech armour on

**eletrical hammer + hammer HM vs gold phantom (3075 shields

* total melee bonus: 20 + 25 + 30 + 30 = 105%
* amp melee bonus: 30%
* gear melee bonus: 12%
* martial artist: 75%
* rage melee bonus: 80%
* power damage bonus: 50% (amp IV) + 30% (TA) = 80%

**hammer HM damage:**

675 * (1 + 1.05 + 0.3 + 0.12 + 0.75 + 0.8) * 1.5 = 4

**e. hammer damage (vs health after hammer HM removes barriers):** 

250 * (1 + 0.8) * 1.5 = 675

* 4070.25 - 3075 = 995.25
* 1687.5 - 995.25 = 692.25 (health left)
* 692.25 - 675 = 17.25 //Gold phantom is left with 17.25 health.

----------

***biotic hammer + 3-hit combo on gold scion (16875 armour)***

**first 2 hits:**

360 * (1 + 1.05 + 0.3 + 0.12 + 0.75 + 0.8) * 1.5 = 2

**last hit of 3-hit combo (enchanted):**

720 * (1 + 1.05 + 0.3 + 0.12 + 0.75 + 0.8) * 1.5 = 4

**b. hammer damage:**

750 * 1.5 * 1.75 * (1 + 0.5 + 0.8) * 1.5 = 6

**Total damage:**

2,792.1875 = 15,475.3875

16875 - 15,399.6125 (popping the sac will kill it from here)

--------------------------------------------------

**extra notes:**

* Biotic/Electrical hammer damage applies after melee damage.
* Tech combo works for TB/FE and CEs.
* Enchant damage multipliers do not apply to normal melee.
* Melee damage on secondary targets do not receive omniblade mod bonus.
* (Hammer) power damage on secondary targets still receive omniblade mod bonus.
* When priming with fire/chill effect of electrical hammer
* When detonating with the hammers
* The ""biotic explosion"" occuring at the end of a biotic hammer smash is not an actual BE.

--------------------------------------------------

* **Power bonus: Better vs bosses**
