Anasazi, The Blessing Way and Paper Clip were the first episode trilogy IIRC - up to then, there were only two-parters and MoTWs. It was a little like an early X-Files movie. I was lucky enough to watch it on my early stages of fandom.


The year was 1998 or 1997. I started watching XF around S2, I wanted to challenge myself and watch grown up TV. I had my blanket on, and whenever a gory scene came up, I buried my head under it. It was good TV, but the Anasazi trilogy - which surprisingly lacked any bloody or scary motifs - turned me into a fan. The local network that aired XF was proud for purchasing the 3rd season fast enough after the US airing, so we didn't have to wait for the cliff hanger resolution.


**WHY ANASAZI WAS AWESOME:**


What was so amazing about Anasazi
I really can't remember, the creator of The Wire, who once explained why he refuses to over-simplify the drug lingo on his show: his viewers, said Simon, are not stupid and rather think for themselves than have everything dumbed down for them. The XF mytharc was too quite convoluted, and required a lot of self-thinking. Some would even argue that in later stages, that idea was taken to the extreme and beyond all coherent plot. But at that time, intriguing


Yep, not cartoonish. No one's disbelief would be suspended. 


Maybe the story conveyed on these three episodes wasn't really fictional, according to sources - who committed ""suicide"" under very suspicious circumstances shortly after. Maybe truth is stranger than fiction. It's true that some of the creatures XF depicted were propesterous or plain silly sometimes, but the story of that trilogy could be real.



**Feminism



Other reasons for liking those episodes, independent, logical, not a sexual object and generally very positive female character like Dr. Scully - but some criticized the fact that she was dragging herself after Mulder, playing second violin to his demented quest for his lost sister. 

Anasazi was the turning point: after Mulder is shot

&gt; SCULLY: There's something else. My name is in those files. It appears in the latest entries with Duane Barry's.

&gt; MULDER: In what context?

&gt; SCULLY: It's not clear


This is, a truth they both had to seek from now on. After the return from her abduction, Scully was reluctant to discuss what happened to her, claiming she has no recollection of those events. Maybe she wanted to forget, knowing somewhere in the back of her head how traumatic the experience was. But after reviewing this file, she cannot turn a blind eye anymore. She is a part of it, this is her life now. Scully becomes more of a Mulder herself


Furthermore, because her sister was hurt, like his. Eventually, when Melissa dies, she truly becomes his equal: they both lost their sisters because of this search for some greater truth. Scully's character gained a lot more depth than the formerly slightly-nagging skeptic shorty.


Another interesting turning point was the well-manicured man's presentation as a congenial

I really don't think The X-Files has a damsel in distress problem, after Mulder was put out of action in ""Teliko"".

I understand that the film most likely cannot be made to fit the timeline given at the end of the series finale, Gilligan, Bowman and anyone else on The X-Files team to make this storyline work.  I can envision the 2012 invasion date coming and going, Dana Scully feeling relief but Fox Mulder growing increasingly skeptical and paranoid. Let's include John Doggett and even Monica Reyes.  Despite any mixed reception the last season received, these two characters became a major part of the final chapter in the television series and sacrificed a lot for the sake of Mulder and Scully.  Even if it's a small part, they should be brought aboard in some capacity.  Where's William? he'd be 11 or 12 years old at this point.

The first five seasons

I think my catchphrase watching season 6 and 7 was (pardon the language) 'Fucking Krycek.' Whenever something was going down with 'The Syndicate' he was there.

Recently I seen some comments around here saying '8 and 9 weren't as good' and others saying 'I enjoyed them' So I decided to watch 8 again to make my own decision. 

I have come to the conclusion that these episodes are just as good and memorable. Watching the opening scenes (or shortly after the opening titles) it all came back to me and are still fun to watch.

I mentioned this in a comment recently and someone asked about the process. For those that are also unfamiliar

There doesn't seem to be any official announcement of it anywhere. Which is why it's cool to find out someone is working on it. From what I understand, so everything was scanned and edited in SD. So shows that were originally shot on film (they did this with Seinfeld, for instance) can now be re-scanned (using the old film negatives) and re-edited for HD using today's awesome technology. It's obviously a long and arduous process to re-edit hundreds of episodes AND re-doing all the effects (so that they meet today's HD standards) so it will take a while.

Originally I had read that they didn't think the series had enough commercial value to merit all the hours that would go into re-scanning and re-editing all the old film negatives. Which is why it's really exciting to hear that they actually are going through with it. I'm hoping enough people buy the blu-rays so that they realize there IS a demand for the show and that they should go ahead and green light a third move.

1348063960.0,104wrq,So I have seven episodes left of the X-Files after rewatching them for the first time since they aired...,drewgarske,18,3,7,"Let me begin by saying that there is just way too much that goes on in the X-Files for any single post could do justice. Just thinking about how much you'd have to talk about to really discuss the show is kind of overwhelming. 201 episodes and 2 movies. That's a lot of entertainment.

Things I've enjoyed that I didn't fully understand the first time:

-The overall scope of the government trying to cover up The Truth.
Throughout the whole show are multiple story arcs, corruption within the FBI and the Cigarette Smoking Man's role in everything, Scully's abduction and pregnancy. I could go on and on.
-The show is more about Scully than it is Mulder. Sure, all the while), Scully is the more dynamic of the two. (Not that I don't love Mulder's long, arduous journey to his truth, but I prefer Scully's).
-The show has tons of awesome guest stars throughout. Bryan Cranston , Burt Reynolds, Jodie Foster, Bradley Whitford are some that come to mind right away. But that's not even scratching the surface. We also see lots of actors/actresses before they became huge stars (Shia LaBeouf, Ryan Reynolds, Aaron Paul).
-Mulder is a dirty bird. Lots of hilarious innuendos that I never understood being a four-year-old when the show started.
-John Doggett is actually pretty badass. I remember disliking him during the originally airing just because ""That's not Mulder!"". In reality
-While the writers did their best, sexual tension for so many seasons, the believer and the skeptic (while the show tries again with Doggett and Reyes, it feels forced to keep the feeling of 'Mulder and Scully' rolling along, as opposed to a natural partnership and dynamic like it was as it developed with Mulder and Scully from the get-go.
-Skinner is also a badass. We don't get many episodes that really focus on him, in the Dead Prostitute arc [for lack of having anything better to call it] we meet his Ex-Wife and see a bit of the personal side of him). 
-The show might have been better off not having a 9th season. Let's face it, and season 9 doesn't really bring anything great to the table. We learn more about Doggett and Reyes, but it doesn't feel right for Scully to be more of a consultant to the X-Files than actually working the X-Files. As I mentioned before, I feel like the show is more about Scully's experiences with the X-Files and path from skeptic to believer; While I love seeing Scully as a mother and her life post-X-Files case work, with Scully being off the X-Files, the show just feels forced.

I like how some of the mythology and questions from the show go unanswered. I like how much of it still remains a mystery and unexplained. The show is about the inexplicable; for some of the mythology of the show to go unexplained is perfectly acceptable and in my opinion

3)  What the hell is the difference between an alien replicant

5)  Krycek?  I don't understand his motivations at all.  What was he after?  When I google, I have no idea.  

6)  CSM.  In the final episode, but after the rebels wiped out the syndicate, I couldn't follow his motivations any more.  

7)  Supersoldiers.  WTF?

8)  Scully's baby.  WTF?   It was either supposed to usher in alien armageddon or prevent it.  I still have no idea which

9)  This one just annoyed me:  FBI somehow tries Mulder without giving him a real trial (ok, and gives him the death penalty.  He escapes, and then they just ""forgive"" him later for helping solve a case.  Uh, what changed exactly?  Presumably, the super soldiers are still in government and still fear exposure from Mulder.  The last movie sucked ridiculously hard.   They seemed to ignore years of plot and characterization.  The whole thing with Scully wanting to drag Mulder back in then wanting him to drop it, then threatening to leave him..  so unbelievable given everything that went before.

Anyway, but in the last couple seasons, it seemed even Gillian was just phoning it in.  I almost wish I'd stopped watching after the syndicate was killed off.   Without the scully/mulder dynamic and the syndicate, I think the show really suffered.  Or maybe I just didn't understand it.

Did the quality of the writing or acting decline?

Did that sappy

As a shipper, it was kind of disappointing. Anyone else agree?

Did the direction the mythology took confuse the crap out of anyone else? I still don't understand what a super-soldier is...

What about Scully's pregnancy? Why write that in only to take away their kid?

1344917266.0,y6og7,Enough is enough is enough (xpost r/GillianAnderson),ozziesoftballs,14,4,4,"Earlier this year, and intelligent man genuinely interested in the life experiences of another human being. Fortunately

I chose during that interview to discuss the fact that, and I chose to do so for two reasons. One was that a woman whom I was in relationship with had died a few months beforehand and I felt, in the context of our conversation, it was safe and appropriate to bring it up. Many years beforehand, and well beyond our time together, this woman had called me out of the blue at the height of my television fame to say that she had been offered $60,000 by a tabloid to provide a picture of us together. At the time, not including shame

The context of our discussion within the interview was 'choice', I could not speak from experience to the fear and shame that sometimes accompanies that realization, because I have always been clear that I am not. During the interview, I do not believe that I had revealed the fact that she had recently died, but in a subsequent interview with another magazine, when asked why I had suddenly chosen to discuss this area of my personal life, I gave that as the predominant reason why but was keen to move on because I really did not want this to become the new topic of conversation about my life. It’s enough that a good proportion of reporters choose to mention the unfathomably boring fact that I was voted most likely to be arrested in high school or the worryingly inaccurate detail that my ex-partner Mark made his fortune in wheel clamping. But for some reason, decided that instead of reporting this legitimate and honest reason to reveal an aspect of my past

So imagine my dismay/horror/disgust to discover that after an interview with the London Sunday Times, as motivation to turn the entire article into a lesbian impregnated specimen of veritable tabloid journalism. I don’t think I’ve ever used the word ""fluid"" in my life to describe my sexuality, nor would I be so stupid or selfish to count my four days with female friends over seven weeks of family holiday as my favorite part. Do I even need to mention that over my dead body would I refer to myself as a ""property wheeler dealer""? I could go on and on. It boggles my mind that this cutting and pasting schlock can be considered legitimate journalism, and by not just an associate editor but someone who fancies herself a champion of women, or should that be the other way round. This article is a perfect example of why publicists do ask for copy approval - not to cover their own lies but to extract the lies and insinuations whipped up by the journalist. I’m not sure if I’ve ever read such a mean spirited interview ""about"" me, although it fortunately and fabulously revealed more about the spitefulness of #3 than anything at all about its apparent subject. But I digress. A bit. Imagine as well, if you will, if she would consider finding a way to work into the article that Mark and I had been separated for some time. Fortunately in retrospect, I was justifiably thrown. Had I said something that implied this? Had I said it out loud even without realizing it? Had my publicist said something? #3 so cleverly picked up on all this confusion and I have to say those pauses and ellipses may be the only verbatim detail of the entire article. Bravo. 

But this post was not intended to reveal my opinions about horrible people in pseudo-powerful positions but to shed light on an intention to share once

This is essentially a chain mail art project. It will be a sketchbook mailed from Phile to Phile, hopefully by February 23rd to celebrate Scully’s birthday. There is no artistic talent required for this. The sketchbook can be used in any way. You can write a short story, a poem, draw, write about the ways Gillian or the X-Files has inspired you... anything. 
Everyone who wants to participate should message me with your address. I will not use it for anything except this project. I will be the only one that sees all of the addresses, and then I’ll message you the next address on the list. (I’ll message whoever is going to be getting the sketchbook next with the address they need to mail it to). Depending on how many people respond, each person won’t be able to have the sketchbook very long if we want to get it to Gillian in February. Please let me know in your message if you are not willing to mail the sketchbook outside the continental US or if you have any other questions. 
If you are wary about giving me your address
I can only assure you that I am a normal, I do completely understand if you don’t want to participate.  

If you don’t want to participate, such as PayPal. If you donate, and still want to participate in the project, feel free to send me a message with some kind of proof and I will write your name in the back of the sketchbook when I get it at the end so you’re still included in the project (and Gillian will see your name!). If you cannot donate I completely understand, but at least you’re reading this and now you are aware of Gillian’s foundation so if you are able to in the future, you’ll be able to donate.  

(South African Youth Education for Sustainability (SA-YES) was founded in the UK in 2008. SA-YES provides guidance and support for marginalized young people making the transition from living in residential care homes to living responsibly and independently in South Africa. 
Young people in South Africa face a number of challenges, many young people end up living on the streets. Ill-equipped to live by legitimate means, too often they end up in prison having fallen into a downward spiral of drug use and crime. 
SA-YES has developed a programme to fill the gap between care and independent living. Each young person in the programme is matched carefully with a trained mentor who offers advice and assistance with housing, personal development and support with family and community reintegration.  
Our aim at SA-YES is to prevent young people leaving care from ending up on the streets by getting them into further education and training, contributing members of their communities). 

Let’s have an adventure!

X-Files CCG was Clue without the board.  Three years into the TV show and a market full of successes like Magic: the Gathering, Middle Earth, etc... X-Files seemed like the perfect fit of sci-fi/fantasy based card games.  Sadly their was only a Premier set with both limited and unlimted (The Truth is Out There relaunch core set) cards and one expansion that was difficult to track down.  It was easy to pick up with the Basic Rules but become more difficult with the Advanced Rules.  Basic Rules was really fun to play and you could do multiple games a session as the rounds were quick.  Draw up your hand, deploy your agents, ask questions and figure out your X-File.  The Advanced Rules introduced far more micromanagement of your resources with a set limit. 

You pick your [X-File](http://i.imgur.com/D6pFz.jpg) for your opponent to figure out.  Each X-File was made up of the 'Affiliation' of the perp,' and the 'End Result.'  [And you had a sheet to click off what your guess is for the X-File](http://i.imgur.com/4Ozqe.jpg).Much like the who, what room, and what weapon in Clue.  Even with knowing one of the identifiers of your X-File it would still be hard to figure out what your X-File was.  Your agents going from site to site would use witnesses and equipment cards to get to the truth, fighting adversaries, events, and bluffs with combat cards.  The only downside, was with enough playing you would run out of your X-File cards to use.  My friends and I rectified our lack of individual X-File cards by pooling all the X-File cards so that all were an option to solve.

The downfall of X-Files was each season would have only offered a few cards and very little change to the game.  They had 3 seasons to build the first set, they were that good.  But, the relaunch of the Premier set as the ""Truth is Out There"" set changed the rarity of the premier set making the game less collectible.

In today's market this type of game would almost be suited into the market of the Call of Cthulhu, were all have a small themed expansion that can be mixed or played solo.  I wonder if the X-Files took their core concept and went from a collectible game of starters and boosters into more of purchasing a set expansion deck game, if X-Files could have succeeded?  

X-Files is a fun game using Basic rules

I am still short of all 479 cards

Both of these incidents are very subtle and completely irrelevant, but I guess a back alley behind a bar isn't the ideal placement for a theatrical poster for a movie. ID4 is after all a movie about an alien invasion (colonisation is strongly hinted), and the nod to X-Files in that movie makes sense.
