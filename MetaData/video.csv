I realize that my bookmarking site could solve this problem.  I developed a video backup feature that copies the video from the host and stores it on myVidster (Amazon S3).  As a test I wrote a script that creates a backup copy (when possible) of popular Reddit videos.  Check out the video collection @ [http://www.myvidster.com/reddit](http://www.myvidster.com/reddit).  Imgur help solved the problem of dead image links and I would like to see my site help Reddit when it comes to viewing video and like Imgur my site is free to use :)
