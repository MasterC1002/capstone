My life long dream has been to pet or even interact with an otter. River otter's more particularly. I'm willing to travel any distance or pay any fee. 

I am curious if anyone knows any  opportunities that would provide this life changing moment. I promise that my reaction would be way more entertaining/humorous then Kristen Bell when she got to interact with a sloth.

Una de las cosas en la que no estoy totalmente de acuerdo es que solo en fechas tales como el 31 de diciembre, se hacen en los días que rodean dichas fiestas promesas que se olvidan y que solo en fechas marcadas por calendario se recuerdan y se “intentan” retomar así como llevar a cabo su cumplimiento.
 
En conclusión el hombre es un animal de costumbres que piensa que por arrepentirse en los últimos minutos del año podrá renovarse por completo.
