What I have come to realize is that King of the Hill is one of the most brilliant animated shows out there... and the reason being is this... It has the best characterizations of each character. It's the only animated show that I feel like I know each character like a family member... and this is also why King of the Hill is one of the funniest shows i've ever seen: Every action Bill or Dale does is hilarious because the action is parallel to their character... Think of when Dale uses POCKET SAND as a weapon... OF COURSE DALE WOULD HAVE POCKET SAND.... or when Peggy always says ""In my opinion..."" whenever she's about to say something that is actually a fact. Or how Bill's feet are covered in fungus... It's BILL.... no other animated show has done this (although Bob's Burgers is well on their way)... each episode gets funnier and funnier because you better understand each character.

 I don't push the subject. It's just that King of the Hill is easily the best cartoons of all time and I can rewatch episodes all the time without getting bored. I just crack up the entire time. 

Glad a lot of you guys are the same and can appreciate this great show. I'm a huge Simpsons and Futurama fan and I'll always pick King of the Hill as the best because of its longevity. Simpsons turned to shit around 2002ish. Maybe earlier.

I want to know how you guys feel about her as a character

&gt;""I don't get this. So many people say that they don't like Peggy, which is why she over-compensates for nearly every aspect of her life. However, she's a very strong female lead, and I find her ""know-it-all"" attitude endearing, and the show wouldn't be the same without it.

&gt;What if she was just some passive housewife? ""Oh Hank... I have no opinion about this because I'm a 1950's housewife and mother. I bake, she'd just be another characterless depiction of a wife, like so many other shows present.

&gt;Look at Family Guy for instance. Very few times have we seen Lois stand up for herself. Mostly, she had much more character and personality. However, now-a-day's, she's just a prop used to play off of Homers shenanigans. Neither of these two women have any personality other than being married to their husbands.
Peggy Hill on the other hand is hard-headed, she stands up for what she thinks is right, even if it's clearly wrong. That's what makes her so funny and unique: her blind and unwavering ignorance to all things that she doesn't understand, but tries to.

&gt;I really can't see how so many people can consider her annoying, and Hank would never be tested - nor would he ever change as a character. And that's who Peggy Hill is - an old fashioned woman trying to fit into the new, modern version of a wife. Yet, she often finds out that these ""new"" and modern variations of a house-wife aren't the right fit for her and her family. I think that is what really brings KoTH, and the Hill family down to earth.
