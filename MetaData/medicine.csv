1370150206.0,1fi7mr,My Primary Care Experience,SacInternist,438,48,71,"This is an interesting thread but one that seems to have few actual voices from practicing primary care doctors.  I wanted to add something about my experience to the discussion. 

I am a 43 yo general internist and have been in practice for 15 years in a large multispecialty group practice. I work and live in a metropolitan area with a population of half a million

For the first 10 years of my career I worked on call to the ER a few nights a month and rounded in the hospital a week every 6-8 weeks in addition to running a clinic practice.  I gave this call schedule up voluntarily 5 years ago when I got married and we started to plan kids

My salary, and I do not pay my own malpractice out of this (just taxes, which is enough).  I take every Wed afternoon off (and take a 10% pay cut to do so, this is reflected in my salary above already), but to be honest I spend half of that time catching up on work.  My typical work day is between 10-11 hours, and I do not take lunch.  I also work a few hours every weekend from home to keep caught up. 

Because I work in a large group practice, just not that particularly irritating kind.  The BS I do put up with includes all sort of Dilbert-esque level large corporate nonsense, but none that has interfered with what I do inside the exam room. 

My visits with patients are typically 20 minutes.  I carry a panel of about 1900 patients
As this is a diverse area, Nigerian, and Brittish expats) and use language line phone translation not infrequently during exams. 

In addition to visits, establishing followup plans from hospitalizations, etc.  I also serve on our quality assurance committee (I highly suggest getting involved in this if you can; it is an education in and of itself). 

Since I work in a large group practice where there are no barriers to communication with specialists

I manage my own heart failure, COPD, etc.  I treat a lot of common ailments, but also spend a lot of time working up new complaints. Because my nurses are great, we can handle some things that might go to the ED otherwise (put fluid into the potentially septic patient while waiting on their lactic acid level, for example, or get same day cat scans done with stat labs on a RLQ abdominal pain). 

When word got out my wife was expecting, inquiries about my family's well being, and other small gifts are common occurrences (and things I greatly appreciate).  The vast majority of my patient interactions are pleasant or downright fun. 

Because I get up early every morning (well, sorry!), I am home in time every night to eat dinner with my family, do bath time and story time with my daughter, and spend time with my wife before going to sleep.  If you do not have a family now, believe me, this will be VERY important to you later. 

My undergraduate degree was from an ivy-league school in molecular biology, but my patients as well!

Personally, and also have repeated the information about colorectal cancer screening so many times it is a loop tape in my head now that I probably mutter in my sleep.  But last week in clinic I also had a new spontaneous pneumothorax (my diagnosis, pulmonary clinic put in the catheter), a new dx of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain in a 42 yo (missed by the ER two days previously, due to her near complete lack of focal neurological findings despite her significant midline shift, a real tragedy for her family), and a follow up appointment with my gent with a thoracic stromal cell tumor (good news, we await final immunohistology to find out).  And also saw the patient who has lost 80 lbs in two years without gastric bypass because she listened to me that she needed to get more exercise and stop eating so damn much.  :)

I have no idea how typical or not my personal experience is among primary care doctors nationwide.  Personally I am quite happy to be practicing as a general internist and have no regrets about my decision to not pursue a subspecialty.  

To the medical students and residents reading this forum - I wish you all the best of luck making this choice.  Finding out you picked the wrong specialty after the fact is a hard pill to swallow,False,,t5_2qhff,False,,,t3_1fi7mr

A recent article in the journal for Dutch doctors describes the current protocol for medical abstinence in neonates (premature or not) who will either die shortly or will live a life with extreme handicaps. At the time of this procedure, do not think we in the Netherlands kill babies with just Down syndrome or learning disabilities, these really are the very very ill babies who stand no chance in hell to ever live or to ever live without suffering immensely.

It describes how these neonates will be taken off the ventilator and will be left to die

To my knowledge

I ask thee

The, you are only abstaining from using medical tools (the ventilator), while in the second you are actively ending the life of that baby a bit quicker by giving certain medication before taking the baby off the ventilator. But the end result is completely the same, but without minutes to hours of suffering by that baby. 

Don't tell me a baby can't suffer. I think these babies suffer more than the average animal being slaughtered.

I'm mad at this; and I want to write a letter to the magazine about this, in the Netherlands, are more liberal towards euthanasia than other countries, so I wonder how neonates who are unable to survive are treated in other countries? ",,False,,1371545350.0,t3_1gkov5

Later culture shows no UTI. Patient has itching of the extremities which proceeds into an entire body rash (hot, itchy). Patient then becomes jaundiced. Blood test shows very high bilirubin count, gets admitted to ER. Patient has ultrasound of the liver, no blockage of bile duct detected. Patient does not engage in high risk activities, however she spent 3 years living in Japan (came home August). 

The tests are still ongoing with her. Blood tests don't indicate an allergic reaction occurring. Both the liver cell levels and liver duct levels are high

-Hep tests are coming back today

-Conjugated bilirubin is high 

-urine is dark yellow and foams bright yellow when shaken

-Abdo exam came up with no pain or enlargement of liver

-The rash originally resembled petechiae

-PT was born with a poorly functioning kidney causing intense pains that were onset at puberty. 70% of kidney was surgically removed in 2003

Some typical experiences. I have...

-been over my duty hours at least 50% of the time,

-stayed awake for six straight days on coffee and 5-hour energy drink because as a night float intern some attendings want you to be present for rounds after your night shift

-had three separate co-interns endorse suicidal ideation in a single day and had at least one of those be serious (they lived)

-Coded three people in a single early morning,

-saw a co-intern work with hourly vomiting/diarrhea (because the penalty for missing a day is to be placed first on the sick call list and this generally means missing 1-2 weeks of elective time)

-been called to sub for a sick intern on my first day off in two weeks (it was a night shift)

-observed a co-intern who had 10 days off in a 4 month stretch of back to back floor months (post night days off count as days off)

-had a nurse not call me for a patient with active GI bleed until the tech noticed that their breath was shallow (Hgb 4.0)

-had a patient yell at me and call me some not-so-nice names for not giving him enough morphine after I recognized a silent NSTEMI on his telemetry and he had to undergo emergent cath

Some funny things did happen as well. I...

-had a knife drawn on me by a patient in their room

-had a patient leave the building to shoot heroin through their IV and then come back high

-had a patient smoke crack in their room

-had a patient's family member attempt to strangle another family member at the patient's bedside

-had a constipated guy pass a poop as big as his head (he was a young man).

I am a Wikipedian I am here to try to disprove some ideas about Wikipedia for you and hopefully convince a few of you guys to help with the project.

**Why should I help?**

Wikipedia medical content is viewed by many people every day and accounts for .35% of daily internet usage (again, and expand upon its content to make it even better. 

Editing also makes you better at helping you with your daily work or school. When I was in EMT class I was able to help expand articles and I realized that if I was able to write it I was able to remember it. Just remember to leave a citation.

**Who can help?**

Anyone! I started editing before I became an EMT and was able to help improve many medical articles. If you have an interest than you can write about it (just cite where you get your information from!).

**How exactly can I help?**

Find an article that you have some interest in and know a bit about. If you cannot choose an article look over [here](http://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=Top-Class&amp;quality=C-Class). It is a list of highly important articles that are not as well written as they should be.  Look over it

We also are looking for translators to help us convert good and featured articles into different languages which do not have such good content. The idea is that we want there to be free and open medical information regardless of where you live. 


**Links**

I am in a US MD program, had zero honors during my first 2 years (yeah...i know), little substantial research experience/volunteering, and a handful of honors/high passes during my 3rd year.  I have no financial support from my family and have been funding my own education. Despite being one of the lucky few to get a nice scholarship, I will be leaving here with around $100k in debt.

Throughout my training, I felt like anesthesia, IM, and emergency seemed like the best options for me (though my exposure to anesthesiology was for only 1 week), but I am going into my 4th year rotation-selection with very little conviction about my would-be career.  Part of me is not convinced that I want the life that a career as a practicing physician seems to offer.   

I am worried because the reasons that I decided to go into this field have been overshadowed by more negative experiences.  The aspects that I enjoy (getting to know patients, the pressures around documentation/CYA, the highlighted systemic shortcomings, and the social exhaustion I feel from working from the bottom of the totem pole in a rigid hierarchical system.  

I watch the residents cope with their indentured servitude and see them struggle to pay for child-care that can accommodate their extreme hours. One intern guiltily remarked that he hadn't seen his kids in the last month because he is always gone before they awake and home after they are asleep.  I've watched marriages crumble, having no children (or even a willing incubator, for that matter), and practicing ""diet-doctoring,"" with significantly fewer patients/paperwork/responsibility. To top it off, I am rarely even reaching 80 hour/week duty hours.  

So... I am likening myself to a guy who is complaining of blisters during the first mile of an ultra-marathon.  Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?  Or is my training designed to increase my comfort in knowing that I am not in a tunnel

So, ED docs willing to talk about their careers, and the factors they weighed most heavily in deciding on specialty to select?  Are there any medical people who have had cold feet during their training?  Anybody out there who took the debt from getting an MD degree but didn't pursue a residency or clinical practice?

Longtime lurker

From a young age I have always had a fascination with programming/web design and startups. I taught myself some web design and was hoping to pursue those fields as careers. Due to familial pressures and my lack of a spine at the time

Through pre-med and now the beginning of the 4th year of medical school, really force myself to find the beauty in medicine. I *love* the problem-solving aspect of it, but that's about it. I cannot stand patient interaction, dealing with nurses and staff, etc. It isn't for me. And medicine just does not offer the creative outlet I'm looking for. Because of that, I've managed to do web design on the side for the past few years.

So here I am with 1 year to go. I'm planning to apply for residency because why not, or create my own health startup. I have very basic programming skills, and am proficient in front-end development and visual/ux design, but I have no other marketable credentials, and my other skills are hardly what you'd call at an expert level. I don't want to spend 12+hrs a day in the hospital doing something I'm not enjoying, yet at times it feels as if I don't do residency, it'll be the end of the world

What options are there for MDs that want to jump ship after medical school? Are any of you out there who found yourselves in similar situations? Anyone out there forgo residency to pursue a deeper interest?

Thanks in advance.

The Dr. suggested that when a pregnant woman is undernourished, when the child is born, it is fed copious amounts of food so that he (especially he, in this case) will grow strong, etc. The male grows 'too large for his pancreas', effectively, and eventually the pancreas gives out in young adulthood even though he is not overweight.

**Tests** – After a year and a half, but it’s still discouraging. Moreover, it feels like I’m preparing to simply regurgitate facts. I find myself missing the days of orgo/math/econ where you had 2-3 hours to solve 5-10 questions. You really needed to think your way through problems. Now it feels like you just recognize buzzwords as fast as possible.

Don’t get me wrong, leading to HTN in the upper extremities and hypotension in the lower extremities. But I can also tell you that while S aureus is the leading cause of osteomyelitis, Salmonella should be suspected in sickle cell patients. However, I couldn’t tell you WHY this is. It’s just a disparate fact without explanation. Any reasonably intelligent person could have memorized this. For whatever reason, this feels unsatisfying. And most of what we learn seems to fall in the latter camp. 

**Work Ethic** – As ridiculous as it may sound, worked during breaks, and led a more active social life. Now, I have literally 0 extracurricular responsibilities and I’m putting in less time and effort at school. It’s not like I’m going out with friends or drinking or doing fun things. I just dick around on reddit or play videogames. I feel guilty, but I can’t be bothered to put in a consistent effort. 

**Clinical Skill** – As far as I can tell, I’m finding out that I’m a pretty shitty historian. I never seem to be able to answer an attending’s follow-up questions, either because I didn’t elicit the information or I don’t understand his/her line of thinking. Furthermore, many of my HPIs and complete histories have been torn apart. It’s never been humiliating, but there’s definitely a sentiment of “You’ve got a ways to go, kid.” It’s one thing that the science isn’t clicking, especially when I know I could be working harder. But when you can’t get the art side down either

**Social Life** – I’ve never been Mr. Popularity, I’m still a little bit nervous about having enough to say to people. I’m not comfortable just jumping into a circle of conversation. It’s like reverting back to highschool where you aren’t sure where you fit in and feel self-conscious about all your actions. 

I know this became super long and I don’t really expect anyone to read it. These are just some things that seem to be getting the best of me lately.

It's a very interesting case because of it's rich semiology. It is a not so unusual disease under quite unusual circunstances. It may not chalenge more experienced doctors so much

I know I was impressed. This case is not in my usual scope.

I won't give our conduct or the diagnosis until before I go to sleep

--------------------

55 year old man, retired due to his condition.

Reason for the consult: ""I've been having some joint pain for a while""

Recent history: Presents with severe joint pain in several joint, that never gets better. all symptons are worst at night, and he often wakes up in pain, because the weight of his sheets are hurting him.

Has been using oral diclofenac for pain relief

Diagnostic hypothesis: gout.

Past history:

Patient had a total of 9 kidney stones. None of them would show on the x-ray, compared to the old ones. He denies back pain, but says one of his kidneys no longer works.

He's been hypertense for as long as he can remember

Likewise

Has had ostheosporosis for 30 years

The chronic kidney failure has been diagnosed about 20 years ago

Also had a ischemic stroke 5 years ago

Ever since the stroke he has been experiencing arrithmias and chest pain. He claims his last physician told him his hearth was enlarged (SIC)

Denies diabetes (one is out!).

Family history: nothing relevant that he can remember. His father died of a stroke (SIC).

Social history: Evangelical. Denies smoking and drinking
Presents no relevant risk factors for any disease that might matter to this case.
Claims he eats little and healthy.

On physical examination:

General state:
Male, 69 cm on abdomen.
Lucid, Glasgow 15/15.
No cyanosis or jaundice. Edema on lower limbs.
Pale mucous membranes 3/4+.

Vitals:
BP: 190x140
pulse: 89 bpm
Temp: 37
Breathings: 22 bpm

Movement:
Got in the room marching with short steps.
Dificulty moving his left arm in any direction.
Had trouble sitting dow and standing.

Cardiovascular:
Regular Cardiac Rythim, no murmurs. Metalic click on mithral focus. Ictus devieted to the Left.

Pulmonary:
Present Pulmonary Sounds

Urinary:
Nothing to report. Giordano sign was not tested.

Complementary examinations (only the altered results):

Slightly elevated neutrophiles.
Slightly elevated plaquets.
Slightly decreased albulmin.

Uric acid extremely elevated.

Every part of his lipidic profile was slightly elevated.

Creatinin 1, creatinin filtering rate 23 (very low).

He also bought exams to support each claim he made about his past conditions

-----------------------------

We started treatment for his new found gout

A guy at our team noticed there was a couple exams we should still make. Biochemic and imaging. We did then

I will come back later to give you people the name of the exams and the name of the disease! I could also add a smalll discusion about how my friend figured out this diagnosis

**EDIT: Time has come...**

Let's think about it backwards, simplified way.

He had acid uric kidney stones since he was 16. Those destroyed his kidneys, because Vit. D is activated in the kidneys. So his bones started decaying. They decayed so much he had trouble walking. He also had anemia, most of the time. This probably got worse with the kidney dying, and must have had a role in his stroke and hearth failure. Now his acid uric levels are scaling even more - you can tell because the crystals are no longer being deposited in his kidneys, but are going thru his blood and forming in his joints. To make things worse, he started taking an NSAID that is terrible for the kidneys and is a powerful antiuricosuric.

So, so I had an idea: calcium was leaving his bones, too.

Turns out no one ever tested his blood for parathormone. It's standard in kidney failure, an endocrinologist, was not.

He told me that my diagnose still had a flaw: his phosphate levels were low. At secondary HPT

**Our patient, but nobody ever thought of it. If he had surgery to remove his parathyroids 40 years ago, he would be mostly healthy today!**

I saw two guys who stated either primary or secondary HPT. Congratulations for both! You couldn't really define which one it was without the info I gave now.

I have to admit, but the people evaluating me disagreed and it's just a serious blow to my confidence. I used to be able to rationalize my sea of P's with the knowledge that in other clerkships, test scores make the grade, and I know I don't take tests particularly well.  What kills me is that this rotation's grade is based almost entirely on evaluations, which have historically been a strong point for me, and I still only passed.   I'm concerned about being found deficient by people in the specialty I've chosen.  At this point, it's not even about whether or not I'll match.

I should be able to pay this off without to much heartache, but really I hate being in this much debt. I graduated college without any debt whatsoever. This is solely educational debt that I incurred throughout residency and medical school. I have no other consumer debt (I do have a mortgage though).

You've all probably seen it, nurses, and the health care system.  
What I have come to understand through my education is a very important point that seems to be lost on the general public - medicine is NOT a perfect science.  It would appear that the majority of people have a completely skewed and romanticized vision of the health care system where they see it as a body that exists to cater to their every whim and diagnose, as long as they understand that medicine and physicians have their limits and that's just the nature of medicine. Further, it seems that public opinion seems to have shifted in a way that physicians are viewed as servants and that positive medical outcomes are a patient's god given right.  When in reality, we are purveyors of expert advice and that we do not operate in a field of 100% success.  

Edit 1:  I should specify that when I say 'servant' I mean that sometimes the expectation is that a patient will know their condition and what they need for it

Edit 2:  The issue that I have brought up is something that I experience outside of the hospital/clinic setting.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with patients on my clinical rounds.  They are typically very receptive, as I have had great patient/dr. relationships with the majority of my patients.  This is an issue of the negativity that I have experience outside the clinical setting.

Does anyone else believe that the discrepancy between patient's expectations and reality has created a very negative public opinion of physicians and health care?  Has anyone thought like this in the past but had their opinion changed by something?  Do more experienced physicians see this issue differently? How do you deal with this issue on a personal and professional level?  Thanks meddit!

I decided this in high school, 250s on step 1, etc) but during the clinical years, I struggled a bit. Turns out, my ability to understand intricate things isn't quite as important as having an ability to decipher what patients are saying, figure out their (usually mundane) problem, and then decide on a course of action.

Being truly shy, seeing patients in clinic, and talking with nurses, therapists and consultants is basically my whole job.

Anyway, the additional stress, and to be honest, some degree of not enough self-confidence. I ended up getting into a family medicine residency, which I started last July.

I guess it's OK. I do really believe that primary care is a valuable thing

But now that I'm actually ""doing"" some real medicine, and I don't like clinic (too quick, too much paperwork, too many drug seekers).

I keep telling myself that, get past intern year, that it will be better, and I'll start liking my job, getting better at it, and I'll love medicine.

But I'm not so sure. I have a hard time thinking that I'll instantly change my personality to be compatible with doing medicine well. Its hard to believe that the nature of the work changes substantially after intern year. I worry that I've wasted so much time and energy and years of my life learning something, far away from.

I don't know what to do. Part of me knows that I can stick it out, I want a career that matches up with my interests, and let's me feel like I'm doing something important for the world. I've thought a lot about the possibility of getting into more of a bench research type of career (though more schooling would probably be needed for that).

1358893961.0,17309m,AOA ,rah10,48,12,50,"Hello fellow redditors. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest.
 
Many DO students (myself included) feel the AOA (American Osteopathic Association) is more of a detriment than anything else. Their extreme obstiancy in terms of making positive changes for the field is really keeping progress in arrested development. Our education is over 90% Allopathic and only 10% Osteopathic yet they want to highlight this difference with lightsabers and continue to delude themselves that they are very different from their MD counterparts.  I don’t mind  the  difference  in approach  however

 What the ACGME did last year was a wakeup call for the AOA when they decided to bar AOA residents from ACGME fellowships.  I felt it was only fair since the AOA fellowships do not allow ACGME residents into their programs. Bringing  the AOA under the ACGME umbrella is the first good step in making the medical field more cohesive for physicians. I do feel many AOA residency/fellowship programs are lacking in standards and I am glad the ACGME will be monitoring them. I also find it quite sad that many DOs are barred from positions at DO schools because they underwent ACGME residencies and fellowships. 
Overall I feel the AOA is going a different direction than the rising tide of DO graduates and younger physicians. If they keep focusing at the past (AT Still) we will overlook the present and damage our future.  MDs and DOs need to unite and I feel many times it’s the DO’s in charge who are grandstanding and refuse any progress.

Currently, due to these problems, I’ve missed quite a number of days. I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to get some letters of recommendation, but I’ve squandered it. 

So not only do I feel like I have screwed myself over even as far as applications go

I’ve talked with student affairs in the past; they seem mostly interested in confirming that I am not suicidal (I’m not) and then refer me to a psychiatrist. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 years now, this may be the worst possible time to take a leave of absence. Additionally, I’m not sure what taking time off would accomplish.

I guess my questions are: Is it impossible for me to be or even become a doctor? Have I kissed my chances at having an acceptable application goodbye? Has anyone else dealt with major depression or sleep disorders through medical school? How did they challenge you

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their advice and concern, and the clerkship director is keeping these issues between us. I have to say, everything has worked out better than I thought it would. I was surprised at the understanding that everyone showed. Still, I have to focus on getting better--I've agreed to meet with a therapist on a regular basis (something I'd not been doing before) and I have a new appointment with a psychiatrist to adjust my meds.

-THIS IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE

-We check your visual acuity. ""Read the letters on the wall"" Gives us a base level.

-We then OBJECTIVELY check your RX (retinoscopy or autorefractor) and if it jives with your acuity, old or new, or amblyopia.  The objective measurement gives us only a baseline.  Autorefractors can only provide decent data; the best in evaluating the axis of astigmatism.

-Then we ask you which is better, even 'I don't know' tells us something.

-First we change the sphere, then backtrack - axis of cylinder, then back to sphere so that we didn't ""OVER-MINUS"" you. See below for further explanation of this one. Finally we balance the stimulus to accommodation between the two eyes; even work loads for the ciliary muscles.

-Next we objectively / subjectively evaluate the vergence posture (alignment of the eyes) for tropias and phorias. Where the eyes position themselves in relation to each other. If someone has 'the googly eye', but their muscles are strong enough to counteract the issue: phoria. You'll see it manifest when they are tired or have been drinking. We see it when we cover one eye and then the other.  They'll complain of seeing double. Sometimes phorias can turn to tropias as you age.  Just like all other muscles, they get weaker.

-The eyes have a triad: accommodation, when you focus on something up close (accommodation), your eyes come toward your nose (convergence) and your pupil constricts (miosis). All this happens at the same time automatically. 

-When you stimulate accommodation by over-minusing/under-plussing

-Over-minusing / Under-plussing is when the lens causes a stimulation of accommodation when looking in the distance. Not harmful

-Most people have enough muscle power to account for small misalignments of their eyes. Some people are on the borderline (either at distance or at near). When you over-minus / over-plus a person that is borderline, there is a prism diopter change in vergence.

-There is no perfect answer, based on history, needs, and goals.  Some people need precision; for some that'd be sensory overload.

-Some of our more 'experienced' patients require help for seeing up close. This takes an extra level of expertise. Basically, and Rx.

-We also evaluate the health of the eye (as a primary eye healthcare provider). If your Rx was -0.50D in both eyes, the middle (lens and vitreous), and the back (retina, nerve, and choroid) for reasons for the loss. Pupil constrictions and eye movements help identify neurological causes for vision loss and diplopia.

-The eye is a very complicated part of your body, Optic Tract, Optic Chiasm, swollen pituitary gland, high CSF pressure, etc. etc.), then things go south pretty quickly.

-Lastly, but children are another. In the US, we give free exams to ALL young children through the InfantSee program.  Most doctors recommend a first eye exam around 2-3 years old, no later than 4.

-Lastly, those $9 frames aren't typically made by adult American / Japanese / European workers in factories with good labor laws...  Typical markup is 100%, the same or worse than many other retail products.

-This post was originally just a comment elsewhere.  It did well so I thought I'd put it here.  I'll be busy for a while and won't be able to answer too many questions

This happens every day behind closed doors and is never publicized. This may sound like a conspiracy theory

Have any researchers experienced funding issues for a potentially safe and effective medical treatment which is 'unpatentable'

I realised the fundamental problem is not a lack of research, a drug will never get the (approximately US$1 billion) funding it needs to get regulatory approval.

A simple solution is to change the law so that major regulatory agencies (e.g. FDA/EMA) can grant 12 years market exclusivity for new drugs (they currently grant only 5 years, which can be used to incentivise development of 'unprofitable' medical treatments for third world diseases.

We need to fix the broken system

Hopefully we can get some industry insiders to start talking about this issue, and there are existing market exclusivity mechanisms already in place. All that is required is raising awareness and get political will to support this simple legislative amendment. 

I don't have a lot of faith in Reddit to help publicise or be sympathetic to this issue

**TL;DR: Unpatentable drugs never get funding for clinical trials. Thousands of drugs are abandoned because of patent issues and the public never finds out. Granting 12 years market exclusivity for new drugs will allow researchers to raise the funding to conduct clinical trials

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes! 

Just to give some more details

A method to accomplish this could be a special clinical trial registration system for otherwise 'public domain' drugs/treatments. The registration of a clinical trial using a treatment protocol (which is published at the same time) would create a ‘priority date’ for that company, the sponsor of the original clinical trial has a time limit to achieve regulatory approval (e.g. 8 years), otherwise priority is lost. At the same time, the company could file new patents on any 'surprising' innovations discovered during clinical trials. This system would allow a researcher to register their clinical trial and have a chance of getting private funding, even without a patent. ",,False,t5_2qhff,True

1318197907.0,l6dww,Fuck you antipsychiatry!!,drolltroll,40,12,96,"Hey Redditors docs

Just wanted to share my thoughts about Psychiatry and my journey towards it...

Anyway, just stating the facts) so am able to choose between various specialties such as Internal Medicine, Psychiatry, Family Medicine. I came into medical school wanting to do Psychiatry because I particularly enjoyed working closely with patients and people, and personally feel that Mental Illness can be far more devastating than other types of illness. During my undergrad years, I got the opportunity to do research and witness clinical psychology. I could see how Mental Illness could tear families up, how patients also have to deal with stigma and how Mental Illnesses can often become the biggest priority. Sure some patients may also have heart disease and diabetes

Anyway

Yet somehow, people in the street, family members....all these people give me negative reactions when I say I wanna be a Psychiatrist. (Its like telling somebody you're gay...there's so much goddamn stigma)

I came really close to not picking Psychiatry. I'm smart

Anyhow, scientologists, disgruntled patients, random armchair scientists (e.g. Joe Blow who took a psychology course and now is an expert on the latest scientific research. Josh Fuckwit who has a friend for whom drug treatment didn't apparently work so he knows for sure shrinks are quacks)....and so on. And I got more and more angry with them all as a whole. I was ready to write off Psychiatry as a career. 

But then again every now and then, not all medical treatment results in instant effective cures. Even if we stent patients or replace valves, patients still die in around 6-10 years from cardiac pathology. We aren't God (yet). There is no effective ""cure"" for CHF or Diabetes. We can do a Whipples procedure but patients will still most prolly die if they have Pancreatic cancer. Similarly in Psychiatry, we can help with symptom management and ease lives, but we may not be able to effectively wipe out the disease. But we can drastically improve lives.

Anyway

Anyway

And another thing: All these behavioural psychologists and psychodynamic theorists who demonize drug treatment may have a vested interest in promoting psychotherapy over drug therapy. They can't prescribe... just consider that folks before citing psychology research studies that say that drugs don't work. There's a place for drug treatment and there's a place for psychotherapy. Usually there's a place for both. When a patient shows up floridly psychotic in the emergency department

Anyway, but I will do my bit to help mentally ill patients. And I'm not doing it for the money. I could have just done gastroenterology or something and made far more money. 

Anyway, family doctors, surgeons, nurses, paramedics.... take the time and trouble to destigmatize mental illness when you have the chance. If you hear some fucktard on the street put down the study and treatment of mental illness, call them out for acting like a dumb ass. Ask the antipsychiatrists what they offer patients who feel suicidal. Education is key to combating mental illness.

I'm just about to finish my second year as an undergraduate premedical student and I've recently begun to think about pursuing a temporary career in nursing. The plan is to leave, I don't THINK that's why I'm doing it. I’ve worked as an EMT and I understand the profoundly important role that everyone plays at each step of the medical system, and further how each person SIGNIFICANTLY contributes to the efficacy and efficiency of the whole system, and it’s for this reason that I’m considering entering the field of nursing. 

I've spent a lot of the last year studying the basic philosophy behind medicine and historical developments that have led up to modern medical practice (and the problems inherent in it) – with all of the changes that will (hopefully) be coming to medical practice in the next decade or so

Downvote me to hell if you think this is disrespectful, I feel like taking this time to acquaint myself with the interior workings of homeostatic medical care is the best option for me. Learning how to treat patients at the level of a nurse will inform how I care for them as a doctor, and I believe that it will do so in a beneficial regard. I mainly question the choice to become a doctor right now because the mentality and approach to medical care at that level is currently in a state of flux. This isn't a concern about job security or being able to ""handle"" the changes - I feel like being able to examine how it is changing from an outside-in perspective would help me shape the most appropriate response once I'm integrated into the system.

I’m aware this sounds disrespectful

I am very interested in continuing to learn about the philosophical theory of medicine

So Meddit

Edit: I understand that looking up disease processes that are relevant for my patients is going to occupy the bulk of my time. I by no means plan on using primary sources. Talking to higher ups, Epocrates, Diagnosaurus, etc. for the day-to-day grind.

I obviously had the gunner comments coming (my douchy user name certainly isn't helping things). It's one thing to be up on your shit and be ready for pimping (and knowing what's going on with your patient). That's not what I was trying to get at. I truly am fascinated with current trends in medicine, not a PubMed level. I like reading about the crazy new robot that runs like a human, or how NASA has made biocapsules that might make unmanaged diabetes a thing of the past in a decade. I like knowing about what's going on with ObamaCare and how it's going to affect the way I practice, without the frivolous details of legislature. What I was looking for was a blog type deal that was similar to Lifehacker or Gizmodo, but for medicine. Big picture stuff, that probably doesn't have anything to do with the way I treat patients (protocols, double blinds, and I certainly didn't intend to give the impression that I was straight gunning. That's not really my style,,

For a few months now, it would wake me from sleep, I just couldn't find any position that provided relief. I again assumed that it was a bad strain, and my refusal to baby it like I should have resulted in me aggravating it, so I took 5 days of Robaxin, did some stretching, and bought a heated neck wrap. No relief.

I finally caved and made an appointment with my internist. We sat down, the standard OPQRST mnemonic, etc. I also explained that I'd checked for Phalen's signs to R/O carpal tunnel causing the radiation, noted a positive Sulcus sign, couldn't palpate any trigger points or AC separation, and did the various range of motion checks you'd do with a patient who presented with a shoulder injury.

His solution: work backwards. Coming from the ED, so I worked up achy 4th finger to my sore trapezius. Coming from primary care, his first instinct was to instead look for something chronic, not traumatic but medical. He checked the range of motion in my neck and noted what was most painful, then palpated each cervical vertebrae. There it was. My perceived musculoskelatal issue was neurological, and the Sulcus sign was just incidental. He pressed on a spinous process, and along with a pop came searing pain in my shoulder that radiated to my last two fingers, and a trip to radiology.

**Lessons learned**:

* When we discharge a patient from the ED and tell them to follow up with a specialist/PCP

* Correlation is not causation. A busy shift with lots of lifting patients resulting in increased pain does not mean the source of the pain is the use of the shoulder.

* They're head to toe exams

* The ER is not staffed by orthopods, derms, rads or any other specialty outside of EM and FM. Ortho, gastro, cardiology, dermatology, and radiology are not our specialties and we'll often miss something if we pretend it is.

* When in doubt

* When certain

* You still can't convince me to take oral steroids ever again. I'd probably wind up with less heartburn after drinking the contents of a car battery.",,t5_2qhff,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/13i00z/scenes_from_the_emergency_departmentmy_personal/

He wears contacts to correct an astigmatism.

Meds: 10 mg Zolpidem.

He mentioned to me once that he thinks he has infrequent heart palpitations

No family hx of sudden cardiac death.  His father and two uncles have both had surgery to correct detached retina.

Your ""math"" is pretty inaccurate and misinformed. Below is an
explanation of my reasoning followed by a suggestion for ""Doctor-Attack
Methods"" that you might find helpful in future arguments. 

Direct patient contact in most US medical schools begins in your first year now
and is continued throughout the second as medical students prepare for their
Step 1 Board Examinations. 

Medical students then undergo 2 years of clinical rotations through primary
care

Upon finishing their 4 years of medical school
to 5-year medical residency as a physician. 

Upon completing their residency they may wish to complete a fellowship (such as Pain Management or Pediatric Emergency Medicine) and will continue their
training for 2-3 years.

Many DNP programs do not require experience as a RN but rather a Bachelor’s in Nursing (a degree rather than experience). 

http://fpb.case.edu/dnp/entry.shtm

http://www.mghihp.edu/academics/nursing/degree-options/rn-to-doctor-of-nursing-practice/default.aspx

Some DNP programs are actually online

http://www.waldenu.edu/doctoral/doctor-of-nursing-practice

http://www.umass.edu/nursing/academics/doctor-nursing-practice-dnp-online

Clinical Education for NP programs is estimated to on average 2

Clinical Education for DO/MD programs is estimated to be on average
20

In conclusion
simply smile

Now to help you with this argument I propose the following statements which I
believe:

1. NPs are just as smart as Physicians

2. Physicians are not automatically better than NPs

Now what I think you should focus on is not the amount of training that NPs receive (it is entirely a poor attack) but rather the performance of Mid-Level
providers and patient outcomes. If you take a look at many studies
treating.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247958

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23243110

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23238621

Therefore, why do we even do that?""

I will say this though. NPs pushing for greater autonomy and responsibility have overlooked I believe is the saddest aspect of medicine: NPs have become simple pawns. 

Don't worry though

Insurance companies and hospitals do not support DNPs or PAs because you provide better care or are more compassionate; they support you because you are cheap. 

You are paid roughly 20-30% less than what physicians are paid

However

But then you will realize that you wish to be paid more because ""wow

At that point

Also, but remember that once you change the game and become independent, you will face the same struggles that have demonized physicians. 

Don't buy that BMW

I don't normally post with this account, personable guy that's straight-up ""on the bubble"", and on *probation* as of now onto the right track. I've given him 2 weeks ""off"" so he can study and not given him shit so far. If y'all wouldn't mind hearing me out, I'd appreciate the perspective.

I think the problems are twofold and the first is easier:

1. He's completely ""gun shy"" now. I feel like the attention and probation has created a mental block. When pimped (by others) he shuts down and starts saying ""I don't know"" to things like ""Why was this patient admitted?"" even though I know damn well he knows why. He's lost confidence and just goes deer-in-the-headlights to pressure. He gives up easily now. I need to be non-threatening and nonjudgmental. I'm going to have to get inside to make change by being much more Jiminey Cricket/Tinkerbell than Mike DeBakey/Red Foreman.

2. This guy is missing basic, and idly passed along until he left, and I'm frankly pissed that this has gone on for over half a year more. He seems lazy, but I think that's just because he has no sense of ""this is YOUR job"" and ""YOU are in charge of this item"". He feels like a 4th year post-match med student that's still kind of ""checked out"" instead of someone sliding toward their 3rd year of residency. He forgets basic things like lab orders and consults even when I remind him, and when he does call a consult he seems to have fabricated no picture of where we're going with the patient, *why* we're calling this consult, what we want to know, and seems to be constantly waiting for orders or criticism instead of using his brain to solve his patient's problems and propose new ideas to me.**

He's not the brightest med student

That last comment was snide, do all the work, and let him get kicked from the program. I'm too fresh for this to be ""not my problem"". My timestamp of experience is going on his brain, and he is given to me as a resident, so that means he should get more from me than I get from him. He does my busy work, and I take the time to give him my all and make him a better doctor the best way I know how.

Share experiences, and I can't for the life of me remember what turned me around. At any rate I don't think what transitioned me into ""physician"" back then will work this late in the game for him.

**TL;DR: Bad resident. Doesn't get it. Gun shy from criticism and that's making him worse. Fundamentally lacking

Appreciate the consideration. Thanks.

**EDIT: I have an idea!** So, this first week, *he* is the attending and *I* am the resident. Check it: His problem is not knowing what questions to ask to formulate a linear and multidisciplinary plan. *He* is now in charge of asking *me* the right questions and getting the pertinent data from me. Nothing is off limits. The rules are simple:

1. You must first check the copy-pasted assessment and plan and ALL of the relevant notes to see if you can figure out why we're doing/not doing something. He must find the deficiencies and things left undone. He gets to pimp me about why I'm calling/not calling certain consults. They are now his patients

2. Nothing is off limits. The only stupid question is the one he didn't ask that fucks something up. No judgement

Obviously, and orders. This will put him in a vacuum of direct cause-effect of his patients for the first time. I'm just here for support and guidance!
