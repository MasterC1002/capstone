Hey @OnionSports

Ok

**WARNING. THE FOLLOWING IS SATIRE. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE INTERNET

A day after being cut by the Minnesota Vikings

""How dare you snot-felching turkeyshits ignore my desperate cries for attention, if my name isn't somewhere in the media or on the front page of Reddit in three fucking seconds, I'm going to light your mother's nipple hairs on fire with her own explosive flatulence."" 

Kluwe then went on another four page rant about the dangers of poorly maintained water heaters,"" interspersed with punting stats that not one single person gives a solitary fuck about, and frankly, wishes didn't exist. 

When asked for comment, ""What the fuck is a punter?"" Kluwe's mother reached out to the Onion and told them her son had died of dysentery twenty five years ago, and whoever claiming to be him now was undoubtedly ""some turdgobbling famewhore.""

",urbanchatter,121,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/1abohy/on_ponder_and_the_cassel_signing/, but he has also bulked up a bit since then.  Twice at the end of the season, and shows what Ponder is capable of down field.  He also had a bomb to Wright against Detroit. Throwing off his front foot on the run (threw off his front foot

     

Not only has he shown that he can drop a long ball occasionally, then I think we will truly be able to judge Ponders ability.  Don't misunderstand me, Jennings is a great, great receiver, but too similar to what we have, and a role I sincerely believe Wright can fulfill.  Alas, I digress. 

     

He has thrown some nice balls, and a more diverse receiving corp.  



I'm certainly not saying that if you give him time, and the chance to prove he deserves them no matter what.  



I love the Cassel signing, he has been wholly underwhelming.  It will certainly put more pressure on Ponder, but not nearly as much as true competition for starting.  In fact, I think it puts just the right amount of pressure.  He now knows that his backup is a guy who could conceivably take his job if he has a string of bad performances.  But, he also knows that the Vikings are going to give him the chance to prove himself.  Signing Cassel only adds to the likelihood of him improving, as he now has a seasoned quarterback, who has a similar skill set



Hopefully, good) quarterback in the NFL,  but only time will tell if he does not. Given the very limited supply of quality quarterbacks in this years draft and free agency, giving Ponder another year to develop really makes the most sense.  No quarterback the Vikings could have gotten this year would come in and perform heads and tails above Ponder.  And, if in fact Ponder does not pan out, then it won't have made much of a difference if the Vikings give him next year to play.  


tldr;
Cut the guy some slack.  You'll be putting up with him for at least the next season

Ole and Sven die in a snowmobiling accident

The Devil observes that they are really enjoying themselves. He says to them 'Doesn't the heat and smoke bother you? Ole replies, ve're from nordern Minnesooota, da land of snow an ice, an ve're yust happy fer a chance ta varm up a little bit, ya know.'

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat even more.

When he returns to the room of the two guys from Minnesota 

The devil is astonished and exclaims

Sven replies, ve don't git too much varm veather up dere at da Falls, so ve've yust got ta haff a fish fry vhen da veather's dis nice.'

The devil is absolutely furious. He can hardly see straight Finally he comes up with the answer.

The two guys love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. The devil decides to turn all the heat off in Hell. The next morning, and people are shivering so bad that they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth.

The devil smiles and heads for the room with Ole and Sven. He gets there and finds them back in their parkas, cheering, yelling and screaming like mad men.

The devil is dumbfounded

They both look at the devil in surprise and say 'Vell, dat must mean da Vikings von da Super Bow!'﻿

I grew up in MN and all my family resides there.  I live and work in Wisconsin and everyone I work with loved the Cassel signing because they can't wait to watch ""the drama"" unfold at the QB position in Minny.

""We've got Rodgers and we're so great - Ponder sucks and we're doomed. Good luck with Ponder

2012 was Ponder's first full season at starting QB and he led the team to a playoff berth! What more could a team want from their quarterback in his first full year starting?

Aaron Rodgers and Christian Ponder have nearly identical completion percentages in both of their first full years at the starting position.  Christian had way less depth at WR last year than AR ever did in 2008.

I know you catch my drift

Now that he's got Jennings - we'll be making defenses think twice about how many guys they put in the box.   Adrian or force Ponder to throw it to one of the best receivers in the league? 

Pick your poison baby.  It's going to be a fun year to be a Vikings fan!

Seriously...I have a lot of trust in Spielman...but let's not screw this up.  This is a HUGELY important draft for us

It's funny watching this predraft stuff...because they're not good at predicting...at all.  I could do as good of a job as Kiper

**WOOOOOOOO**

Official prediction of this moderator.............Teo with 23 and trade down to top of rd 2 with 25

hnnnngggggg HURRY UP

You guys are awfully quiet

I can't get my windows adjusted properly...this is annoying

**1st Pick - KC - Eric Fisher**

Whoa...ok...not Joekel...interesting.  Kalil is way better

**2nd Pick - JAX - Luke Joeckel**

Kalil is still better...safe pick for Jax

**3rd pick - MIA (traded from OAK swap 1st rds and added 2nd rd 41) - Dion Jordan**

Whoa whoa whoa...damn surprising.  I also surprised myself just now by eating way way way too much pizza and wings.  Holy crap.  If I stop updating it means I died from cheese and chicken clogging my heart shut

**4th pick - PHIL - Lane Johnson**

Mike Vick might not get murdered quite as much this year.  Make no mistake

First mention here of it...but the Cowboys hopefully will pick a WR or Kenny Vaccaro

Will DET take Milliner?????????  I think so

**5th pick - DET - Ezekiel Ansah**

Oh boy....dude has bust written all over him...their line could be scary if he was good.  Should have taken Milliner or the dude from FSU.  Silly risky pick

**6th pick - CLE -  Barkevious Mingo**

SERIOUSLY WTF CLEVELAND???  DO YOU WANT TO BE GOOD OR NOT?  YOU SURE AREN'T ACTING LIKE YOU DO

**7th pick - ARI - Jonathan Cooper**

Makes sense and makes sense...he's better than our guards

**8th pick - STL (traded from BUF a bunch of picks holy crap Buffalo made out like a bandit and got to screw over the Jets in the process) Tavon Austin**

Good pick for them...they need it and a RB....and an OLine....and a DLine...and a coach who isn't praised for going 8-8 every year

**9th pick - NYJ (they're crying right now...true story) - Dee Milliner**

Needed...they're going to be awful next year...awful.

**10th pick - TEN - Chance Warmack**

Great pick...I'd love to have him.  He's badass and probably the best player drafted so far.  Yeah

**11th pick - SD - DJ Fluker**

Needed pick...but ahahahahahahahahahahahaha he's not that good.  Reminds Mayock of Loadholdt...so lots of offsides and holdings to be called on SD next year

**12th pick - OAK - DJ Hayden**

What the fuck...how did they not pick Floyd?????????????  Well...ok...I wonder how much it will cost to go get him...because the Vikes NEED to think about it

Do the Jets grab a QB?  I can only hope

**13th pick - NYJ - Sheldon Richardson**

Good pick

**14th pick - CAR - Star Lotulelei**

Stud that

**15th pick - NO - Kenny Vaccaro**

I was sooooooo hoping the Cowboys would take him.  Whatever

**16th pick - BUF - EJ MANUEL**

HOLY CRAP WTF NO WAY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA....Ponder's back-up/replacement....as someone who watches FSU all the time

**17th pick - PITT - Jarvis Jones**

Is it our pick yet?  Can we get Floyd now?  Please

**18th pick - SF (trade from DAL) - Eric Reid**

what

not kidding

what

well

wat

maybe

what

**19th pick - NYG - Justin Pugh**

NOW...do the Bears DARE to take the TEO???!?!?!?!  I say no...we'll see

**20th pick - CHI - Kyle Long**

WHEW WHEW WHEW...they needed that...we need the TEO

**21st pick - CIN - Tyler Eifert**

is Floyd seriously going to fall to us?  Totally crazy...especially if the falcons pick Rhodes like they should

**22nd pick - ATL - Desmond Trufant**

Holy crap

**23rd pick - MIN - SHARIF FLOYD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

WOOHOOO OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**O**

**M**

**G**

and we have no MLB...can we get back into the 1st round?  Do we have to?  THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS!!!!!

6 more picks

**26th pick - GB - ~~a bag of poop~~ Datone Jones**

Didn't want to run the ball anyway

**27th pick - HOU - DeAndre Hopkins**

Still can't believe we had those picks...and trying to figure out how we're going to get back into the first **OMG WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE FIRST ROUND HOLY CRAP**

**28th pick - DEN -Sylvester Williams**

ARE WE GETTING BACK INTO THE FIRST?????????????????????????

**ARE WE GETTING BACK INTO THE FIRST??!?!?!?!?!?!?**

WE DID WE DID AND HOLY SHIT WE PAID FOR IT...highway robbery holy shit.  GOTTA BE TEO

**29th pick - MIN - Cordarrelle Patterson!!**

WOW NO TEO WOW WOW WOW I HOPE HE CAN CATCH!

Jesus

This also means no ROBERT WOODS...which makes me super super sad.  Dammit.  And no MLB which is a HUGE PROBLEM. 

WAIT ONE DAMN SECOND

No?  we can't?  Well

**30th pick - STL - Alec Ogletree**

This has been an absolutely INSANE draft...glad the Rams are committed to being 8-8 forever

If the cowboys pick a WR or RB my night will be made...for sure no doubt...because Jerry Jones is Al davis

**31st pick - DAL - Travis Frederick**

DAMMIT

**32nd pick - BAL Matt Elam**

Not Teo....THERE IS STILL HOPE THAT WE CAN GET HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Is there anyone dumb enough at the top of rd 2 to trade their pick for Toby?

So, 3rd, and 4th place teams.  The funny thing about that, when applied to the Vikings?  Well, so far:

You're 1-0 against 1st place teams (49ers)

You're 3-0 against 2nd place teams (Lions

You're 1-1 against 3rd place teams (Jaguars &amp; Seahawks)

You're 0-3 against 4th place teams (Bucs

Now, if we assume your percentages hold up within each tier, you'll sweep the Packers, Texans, and Lions, split the games with the Bears, and lose to the Rams, which probably makes the playoffs (you'd hold the tiebreaker against everyone in the NFC North

Dan Wiederer of the Star Tribune provided an in-depth look at the situation in a post this week. One of the reasons why Winfield would return to Minnesota is that he'd be continuing to play in a familiar city, money is not the sole determining factor in this situation, and it may not be the most important one, either; according to Wiederer, Winfield is more interested in an acquiring team's chances at contending for a title. That may actually help the Redskins and harm the Vikings, but it's a matter of opinion which of those two teams is more suited for success in 2013.

A few weeks ago I posted [this infographic](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1cy1kc/i_created_a_visual_history_of_the_green_bay/) I made for the Packers.

there will be a lot of cursing tonight

I don't know if you all have noticed, because they've been downvoting the crap out of some stuff

One hour to kickoff....uff da this will be FUN! 

Regardless of who our QB is **LET'S GET IT ON!!!!!!!!  GAME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  Good luck all

If we win we should get to chop off Clay Matthews' goldie locks

--------------------------

I'll take that return

Peterson pounds

**JOE FUCKING WEBB**

I bet we can win this game without attempting a pass.  How incredible would that be.  Unfreakingstoppable

Call a sweep over Matthews now!  DO IT

Settle down back there

OMG THAT WAS TOO CLOSE DON'T MESS WITH ME LIKE THAT BLAIR!

Put Rodgers on his ass.  A lot.  I'll be even happy with an early roughing the passer

**TACKLE GOD DAMMIT**

Nice super quick 3 and out

**THAT** was a good playcall!

Good pass and catch

MY HEART STOPPED DON'T DO THAT, DON'T GET TOO SMART

I miss Pat Williams...so very very very much

Please no more penalties like that....please.

So close for Allen

**WRAP UP YOUR TACKLES AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG**

We're getting screen passed to death....I WONDER IF THAT WOULD WORK IF YOU HAVE AN ALL-WORLD RUNNING BACK??!?!

Good lord

**Pat**

**Williams**

Uggggg

WE need to dial it back and play more towards our strengths...ground and pound baby OR SCREEN PASS LEFT!!

One more quick thought on that defensive drive...if we're not going to cover the middle (which obviously we're not) why don't we blitz Brinkley up the gut and collapse the pocket a bit

POUND POUND POUND

Bleh **STOP DOING THAT JOE STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!!  DON'T LET HIM BACK ON THE FIELD UNTIL HE PROMISES NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE**

Need a big stop now

The soft middle is KILLING us

Awesome!!!  **SEE

Stopped...everyone breathe...

Peterson in so close to breaking one.

Sigh...that was a GREAT punt at least

How about a STOP...let's see what Crosby has tonight...or not...Jesus.  HOLD HOLD HOLD

At least Finley's hands are consistent.......

That was HUGE!  BIG HUGE STUFF!  Welp

Joe has a cannon

This is awful offense

Defense too

UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.  That looked easy.

Should we put in the call for MBT?  Because why the hell not

Screw it

---------------

Bad half is over

------------------

We're only 2 scores down ATM

So close....so very close

It wasn't close that time

There is a LOT of time left

I still &lt;3 Harrison

You.  Have.  To.  Be.  Kidding.  Me.

Ouch...that one hurt bad.  

One more series for Webb, no reason not to.

A first down would be nice

It's the little things now...KEEP GOING THIS DOESN'T SUCK KEEP GOING!  More easy passes.  I said **EASY** passes

Wright doesn't suck...at all.  He and Jenkins can stay

WE HAVE to go for it.  Welp....it's kind of like it was just an incomplete pass.  SILVER LINING FOLKS...SILVER LINING!

Oh no................OH NO!  GET UP HARRISON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  **GET UP!!!!!!**  He got up...whew

**WE GOT A STOP!!!!!!!!**

Can we put in MBT now

OH GOD.......................................just stop with Webb.  I'm starting to feel bad for him.  Damn damn damn.  He's not even close to ready for this

You have got to be shitting me.  Wow.

OOOOOOOO JOSH!!!!!!!  He's pretty good too!  

Look, read, heard, whatever, is a really good dude, but GET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF THE GAME.  I feel so bad for him right now.  Our whole team is being completely DOMINATED, let's not get anyone hurt who matters and play some deep bench guys so they can tell their kinds they played in a playoff game.  Dammit

We lost this game because we were completely outclassed in every aspect of it.  Screw the Packers

AD is still a MF'ing beast

Look, this roster is getting full of young talented players.

**TOUCHDOWN 2 SCORE GAME!**

Still sucks...anyway.  We have a bright future and really good things to look forward to...so keep your heads up

Wide receivers have been open downfield all game long

Should we try to have a consensus team that this subreddit roots for?  I'd nominate the Seahawks

Jenkins still doesn't suck.

Greg Jennings Diversifies Vikings

The former Packer helps the passing game

by KC Joyner

A case can be made that very few playoff teams in NFL history had a more one-sided offense than the 2012 Minnesota Vikings. The Purple and Gold had the presence of possibly the best power running back since Earl Campbell (Adrian Peterson)

What was already a deficiency took another hit when Percy Harvin was traded to the Seattle Seahawks for a collection of three draft picks earlier this week.

Those elements were likely a huge reason the Vikings signed free-agent wide receiver Greg Jennings to a five-year deal on Friday.

Jennings, will obviously upgrade Minnesota's passing game, but by how much? Is he enough to get this aerial attack to the point where it can keep defenses from keying on stopping Peterson, thus give All Day an even better chance at breaking the single-season rushing yardage record?

To find this out

Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder had abysmal showings in the vertical yards per attempt (9.2) and stretch vertical YPA (10.2) categories in 2012. (Note: vertical passes are those attempts thrown 11 or more yards downfield; stretch verticals are thrown 20 or more yards.)

His performance on downfield passes also got worse as the season progressed -- from Weeks 12-17, in the final third of the season the Vikings had no field-stretching pass game to speak of (although, to be fair, some of that had to do with being able to lean on Peterson so heavily).

Those numbers start to look even worse when Harvin's targets are subtracted from the equation

Now that the current state of matters has been determined

His 2012 season doesn't tell us much because a torn groin muscle and the associated rust that goes with missing practice time reduced Jennings to weak marks in overall YPA (6.5) and vertical YPA (5.5).

But since Jennings should enter this season fully healthy, ranked 10th; 16.3 stretch vertical YPA, ranked 20th), so it can be assumed that those numbers were not anomalies.

The issue with using those totals as his potential impact point is that even though his metrics look great from an overall perspective

For example, 35 stretch vertical), but that doesn't explain the 2011 season.

In that year

All of this leads to the conclusion that, let's count on him being more of a midrange target in the passing game, which would be somewhere around a 12-yard vertical YPA mark.

With that figure in mind

To do this

If Jennings racks up a 12.0 vertical YPA on 50 of those throws and the other 50 throws end up posting an 8.8 vertical YPA (which assumes no other improvements among the receivers)

History says that type of performance will place a quarterback right around or just below the middle of the league in that very important metric. It might not sound exciting

This is not to say the move is a slam-dunk to work, if the past is any indicator, Jennings should be able to make defenses pay the price for devoting too much attention to stopping Peterson and thus give Minnesota a strong chance to make back-to-back playoff appearances for only the second time since the 2000 season.",,False,,t5_2qocl,,http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/1aj2t7/espn_insider_article_greg_jennings_diversifies/

http://www.patriots.com/media-center/videos/2012-Draft-Prospects---Trevor-Guyton-DE/a153d871-e81d-4ee6-a736-919b7496cc36

My takes:

**Kalil** - The logical pick. Couldn't have missed between Claiborne and Kalil, LG, QB). Also, they picked up 3 extra picks at the expense of the Browns and still got their guy, so this may be the best selection of the draft.

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/matt-kalil?id=2533131

**Smith** - A great fit in the cover 2

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/harrison-smith?id=2532948

**Robinson** - Vikings channel al Davis and take the fastest guy in the draft. Been clocked sub 4.3 in the 40 time. Also had a great 20 yard shuttle vertical and broad jump. He will likely compete to be a starting corner

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/josh-robinson?id=2533542

**Wright** - A burner at WR

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/jarius-wright?id=2532978

**Ellison** - When ESPN listed him as a FB I was scratching my head. But he'll likely play an H-Back role. Blocking TE part of the time

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/rhett-ellison?id=2532835

**Childs** - An Arkansas pipeline is starting to materialize in Minnesota. Vikings get a possession receiver to compliment the downfield threats they've added this offseason in Simpson and Wright. Should compete to be a #4 this season.

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/greg-childs?id=2533334

**Blanton** - A corner at ND, Smith and Blanton). If Blanton impresses he's going to have a shot at starting. The Vikings are incredibly weak at safety and any new blood will be good for the position. I hope this pick does not mean Abdullah is not re-signed. Despite his concussions I think he has a chance to be a starter 

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/robert-blanton?id=2532794

**Walsh** - A head scratcher of a pick.  I did not expect a kicker.  He's hit some long ones at UGA

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/blair-walsh?id=2533011

**Cole** - Fills a need.  Should add some depth at ILB with Jasper Brinkley being the only rostered ILB that I can name come up with.  

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/audie-cole?id=2532814

**Guyton** - Another depth move.  Hard to really praise or admonish a 7th round pick.  Didn't play much at Cal which is why he dropped this far.  I'll take it.

Testing this out. Usually Swamp handles the game threads, he gave me the go. In honor of Swamp's incredible generosity, I will try to replicate his extreme enthusiasms while updating this thread! Let this also be a prototype game thread. Hopefully, in the future, we will try to make them even more professional looking!

\#SKOL VIKINGS!

The first half is over and I must say - PATTERSON IS LOOKING DAMN GOOD. Not great, so that wasn't fun. Burton is looking to make the roster, and so is Zack Line - each had long catches, and Line wouldn't have had the TD without Burton's blocking. Sharrif is out for the game, but I'm sure he will be fine. Nothing major at all. He played disruptively when he was in. Cassel is looking like Cassel. There isn't much velocity on the ball and he got sacked fairly easily (albeit, our second string line was terrible). Don't expect Cassel to ever start over a healthy Ponder.

Jon -

After reading your column titled,"" within which I certainly agree regarding Chris' positive effect on the Minnesota community, I question your assumptions about other Vikings players' community involvement. In your piece you indicate the majority of players only participate in charitable causes by letting an organization ""use the player's name or agreeing to the occasional photo op."" You also note, ""Rare is the pro athlete who commits real time, or heaven forbid money, to the charity or issue."" As it relates to the Vikings, neither of those comments has any merit. In fact, including numerous players

In case you aren't aware

1) Player Participation - In six of the seven years

2) Personal Foundations/Causes - Various players have their own personal foundations or causes, Adrian Peterson (All-Day Foundation), Erin Henderson (Erin Henderson's Foundation 50), John Sullivan (University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital) and many more. General Manager Rick Spielman and VP of Football Operations Rob Brzezinski also host an annual Adoption Family Fun Fest for families from the African American Adoption Agency and Children's Home Society, while Coach Frazier is heavily involved in Fellowship of Christian Athletes and All-Pro Dad.

3) Vikings Children's Fund - Since 1978, the VCF has averaged annual contributions of approximately $465,000 (over $3.8 million). In the 27 years prior to the Wilf ownership, the team's contributions averaged approximately $245,000 annually.

4) Annual Playground Build - The Vikings Playground Build has become an annual tradition for the team,000 students, and will complete its eighth at the end of this month.

5) Summer Lunch Program - The Vikings partner with Second Harvest Heartland to help feed underserved children during the summer months when they are not able to receive free or reduced-price lunches through the school. Over the last three summers,000 meals to underserved children.

6) Vikings Fitness Playbook - Last year the team partnered with the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital to kick off a campaign to research childhood obesity. That partnership aligns with the team's other ""Play 60"" initiatives

7) Vikings Youth Football Program - The team provides free youth football clinics every year,000 to replace or repair four area football fields.

8) Saturday Special Guests - The Vikings invite individuals facing a challenging time in their life to a private Saturday practice followed by a meet and greet with the team. Last season's visits included children from the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital

1367328081.0,1depvw,What if Christian Ponder DOES NOT have a breakout season this year?,ragnarockette,60,11,163,"I really hope Christian Ponder has an amazing season. We've certainly worked hard to get him the tools he needs to do so.

...However...what if he doesn't? Most of us feel that three years is a long-enough time to evaluate a quarterback, I think most Vikings fans agree, it will be time to re-evaluate. 

What will the post-Ponder plan be? 

Who are the top QB prospects for next year's draft at this point? I think our team is too good to get a high pick - we'd probably have to trade a lot to get a potential franchise-guy. Is that worth it?

Are there any key free agents that will be available? 

Do we try and make a go of it with Matt Cassel? Do we expect him to take many snaps this season? 

Why is there a construction worker outside my window wearing a Steelers sleeveless jersey?

These are questions that need answers. It may be early, have had my Ponder doubts from day one. If this draft pans out like last year, we will be a scarily complete team. QB is a make-or-break position. I want to know what our worst case scenario plan is.

Now

It's been a convenient relationship, stuff like that matters.

I've stuck with the Bears for a while now -- and I still do like the Bears -- but there's nothing I really *love* about them besides Urlacher, and they will likely be in playoff contention for some time -- that spark just isn't there anymore.

And then there's Minnesota. I've tried to deny it but I don't think I can hide my true feelings any longer.. I think I'm starting to fall in love with the Vikings, Kluwe, Walsh, Jared Allen, Harvin -- plus how *oddly nice/polite* your entire fanbase seems..

When Minnesota lost to us in GB for the Playoff game I could tell it hurt bad for them to lose that game.

* 2: You're assuming all three picks, and an early 4th round pick will all be GREAT picks. Not just all starters but one being an impact player. What are the chances? or even 2/3 panning out? or even one of them turning into a very good starter in the NFL? Check the histories of players picked at those spots the last few years.

* 3: Wait a second, KAllen or Woods? Brown, Teo, or Minter? ALL most likely gone. Great value at CB there but we already took Rhodes. Also probably still good value at DT too, but. So who then? We'd have to go WR, then I guess MLB in the 3rd. So we wouldn't have ended up with one of the top WR everyone wanted so very bad, nor MLB.

* 4: But CP is a bust, and can't even run routes. All 1st WR are boom or bust basically. Late in the 1st is the perfect spot to take a risk, especially one someone with so much potential. Repeat his potential is sick, CP's potential &gt; Austin's (pure slot WR) potential. Leslie will be a great role model/father figure, Jennings will be the perfect mentor/big brother figure, and we have a great WR coach. Not only is that a great group for him to be around to learn/grow from, he'll be playing with Purple Jesus

* 5: WR's usually don't break out until year 3. Yes, screens, short passes/quick slants, reverses/end arounds, line up in the back field, and of course just go deep. Don't really need to know how to run routes/read D's on all those plays. We shouldn't have a prob getting him enough touches to make an impact. With the ball in his hands he is electric. 

* 6: Even if CP is a major bust, a 2nd rounder, and two 4th rounders to move up and take Julio Jones. And by all accounts he has that potential to be an explosive playmaker. 

* 7: 1st round picks get 5 year deals instead of 4 for 2nd rounders. Late first means his salary is very very low for a WR for 5 years. Especially if he pans out.




***Bonus: I still don't think this is necessarily the ideal way it coulda went, not at all, considering CP's potential and how bad we needed to get a young stud WR.


tl;dr: Instead of maybe finding 1 pretty good starter and hopefully 2 other decent players...WE FUCKING SWUNG FOR THE FENCES.

Are we going to play prevent defense the rest of the game?  I know we're not

Crappy penalty

I hate these long drives when it's not the Vikings doing it.  MORE AD DAMMIT...I DEMAND MORE AD

And Mason Crosby just missed his 29th field goal attempt of the game 

Just to be clear

Booo Rams BOOOOOO

The things that Peterson is doing are absolutely unreal.  We're going to be spoiled for a long long time because of him.  It's astounding

Alright alright alright...enough bad prevent d

sigh

HOLY CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

S'ok...Walsh has GOT this

We are witnissing such greatness....Peterson would have 2500 yards if he had gotten the ball more in games 4-8

Finally decided to play defense...nice

Couple more carries for Peterson

And game over!

First

1) Sharrif Floyd looks pretty good

2) Ponder looks iffy so far.  There's a mix of solid throws and poor decisions.  He definitely hasn't regressed but he doesn't look he's made any serious strides.  Time will tell

3) Jennings is the clear cut number one receiving option.  He looks great, but if he gets space, he's dangerous.  The receiving options will definitely be there for Ponder, so if the passing game struggles this year, it's on him.

4) Regarding Joe Webb as a defensive back, plus he hasn't had too much trouble creating space.  He could become a legitimate contributor.

5) I think Erin Henderson has looked tremendous so far.  During the draft I was skeptical on them passing up early chances to take a MLB

Harrison Smith also looks great

6) I think the linebackers will be alright.  As I said

7)  There are a couple rookies working in with the linemen

8) The players all seem really high on Harrison Smith

9) The London game hasn't really been brought up yet

10) Special teams coordinator Mike Priefer and defensive line coach Brendan Daly both have really stood out from a coaching standpoint.  I think Jeff Locke will more than fill in Kluwe's shoes as both a punter and a holder for Walsh

Daly just brings an energy that commands your attention.  The defensive line all really respect him and pay attention to what he's saying.  His passion is exciting.



For /u/Stonedude22, while also taking some shots downfield.  He can get involved in a lot of different ways.  He's also the number one option at kick return as of right now.

For /u/SurlyMike, but I think AD and their defense should get them to right around where they were last year.  If I had to make a prediction I'd say wildcard playoff birth or the first team to miss the cut.

For /u/whatsthasitch
-Not sure what Peterson eats for breakfast
-I think Patterson or Wright will hold the #2 receiver spot.  Probably more clear cut Patterson as the year progresses
-Samantha Steele has made a few appearances
-DC Alan Williams seemed doubtful of a Floyd/Williams pairing but you never know.  I think if Floyd shows a lot of improvement during the season anything can happen.  The first preseason game will show a lot.

It's all contingent on Ponder

The icing on the cake for this season is that the expectations for this club around the league is LOW. Nobody talks about this team ever. And that's perfect. It can make the rebuilding years go a lot more smoothly in the coming years.

*  top-5 in most major passing categories,705) completion percentage (69.7) and yards per attempt (8.2). 
 *  He and Matt Ryan are the only quarterbacks who are in the top-5 in all four categories. 
* has 16 plays of 30 or more yards
*  throwing a touchdown pass every 15.7 attempts
*  posting a 3.5 touchdown to interception ratio

&gt;**Peterson**

&gt;* 112.8 yards rushing per game

* averaged 2.8 yards per rush AFTER first contact.
* 6.3 yards per carry when defenders put at least eight men in the box
* has faced eight or more defenders in the box on a league-high 57 rushes this season
* has gained 20-plus yards on 13 runs this season
 * almost twice as many as the next rusher

**My Thoughts**

Personally I think its close. Both players came back from debilitating injuries

Peterson on the other hand is having his way with defenses who are crowding the box to stop him (as per the usual). He is leading a team that only managed to win 3 games last season

Berrian is out

1. **I FUCKING LOVE YOU CHRIS PONDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

2. OMG I LOVE YOU HAVE MY MAN BABIES!!

3. AND WE HAVE THROWBACKS ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I SENSE AN ALL CAPSLOCK POST FROM ME TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Dammit that it wasn't a TD.  Lets smash it in

5. Just awesome...just fucking awesome!

6. Now let's see if the D can hold up

7. I hate our pass defense against tight ends.

8. Need lots and lots and lots of JA and BROBB.  I hate Ryan Grant.  Ugg.  And still pissed at Cook...I can't really express how pleased I had been with his play the last couple weeks.  This sucks.

9. Need line pressure or we'll get slaughtered

10. If we can hold them to a FG we should all rejoice

11. The key to limiting them is tackling after the catch.  That's going to be the true test

12. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.  Allen had him.  0.5 more seconds.  Ufff.

13. I think that we need our D-Line to hit Rodgers hard and often.  He can be rattled.

14. More Ponder = more happiness.  Let's go O!

15. Clay Aiken needs to cut his hair

16. **HOLY SHIT A QB WHO DIDN'T THROW IT AT THE RECEIVER'S  FEET!!!!!!**

17. That usually does well.....

18. Arrggg Booker

19. Kluwe time.  Have you seen him getting on Peter King on twitter??  Good stuff

20. Jesus.....

21. Good tackle JA

22. **AND A HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE SACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  We need that.  A lot of that

23. WTF Penalty.  No more please

24. That was a risky pass....lucky too

25. Percy up the middle!  That's new....not bad either

26. I don't like those throws at all.  Too soft and not enough separation by the receiver

27. WOOOHOOO WE GET IT BACK!!!!!!!!!  OK...let's see some AD pounding and *good* play action stuff

28. That was sweet.  Wow that was a good run and decent blocking off the line.

29. Nice little run.  3rd down conversions killed us during the McNabb era...let do better.  YAY!

30. THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!  ACCURACY IS FUCKING FANTASTIC!

31. TD.  Guion as an upback is fun

32. what.  the.  fuck.  :(

33. How about Rodgers throwing an incompletion soon 

34. Nice stop BRobb.  He needs a haircut too.

35. Vomit vomit vomit.  I don't even know if you can do anything about this.  I hate the dude

36. That ball was uncatchable btw.  Damn

37. Double Finley plaese.  Again

38. Jared Allen is a man amongst men.  

39. Perfect time for your first incompletion!  Watch for the fake.  

40. Ok guys...calm down and quit kicking the fat Packers dude in the balls BRobb.  Not needed at this point

41. Just off on that throw.  Should have been caught but Aromoshadu should have been ready

42. Another 3rd down conversion.  This is simply amazing

43. And that was against a couple blitzes.  McNabb would have held the ball and blah blah blah...know what

44. First down again!!!!!  This shit did not happen before.  And on target passes are so awesome.  I'm trying to move on

45. THERE YOU GO AD!!!!!  I like the space between the first and second levels

46. OOoooOoOooOOoooo caught from behind.   Don't let it happen again Chris

47. Passing to Aromashadu seems a little scary at this point.  Go Ryan.  And it's good!  That was a great great nice long time consuming drive.  When have we had one of those recently?  

48. Should it bother me that Webb and Ponder are the only Qbs meeting with the coaches in those camera shots?  

49. Need more pressure up the middle

50. Bad time for that LeTroy.  :(  Plus with the penalty they didn't have to use a time out.  Come on guys.  Keep your focus

51. We need one

52. Great great great first half Purple!  Keep it focused and keep it up.

HALFTIME

1. Let's keep up the pressure on Rodgers

2. Oh dammit dammit dammit...............ugg.  How does that happen?  

3. We need new safties.  Here's the order of need for drafting.  O-Line &gt; Safeties &gt; O-Line &gt; CB &gt; O-Line &gt;D-Line

4. Damn not quite.  3 and outs aren't good.  Let's get some bigtime D.  Could have used some bigtime special teams...........................

5. Ohhh shit almost had him

6. **YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE THOSE TACKLES**

7. ..............................................

8. Refocus and march down the field.  We don't need to score all at once or right away.  We just need some big long drives and some patience.

9. AD should not get tackled like that.  And that was strange by Ponder

10. I'm pretty sure we need to never throw it to Aromashadu ever again.  He had one good game.  And most of that was luck.  Ex-Bears WRs need to go

11. Bad decision Ponder.  You're a rookie so we'll forgive you.  But that was a bad bad decision and not a great throw.    

12. Maybe the D can do something.  Maybe

13. BULLSHIT.  That is not catchable....BULL SHIT 

14. nice stop...nice stop

15. Again

16. He seems more nervous now than when the game started

17. NEED TO THROW THE BALL HARDER!!!!I think McNabb is telling Ponder that it's impossible to throw ints if you ""corrctly"" throw the ball at your receiver's feet 

18. Nice sack Griffen

19.  Wow....just wow.  OK ok ok ok.  

20. The rest of the game is just experience for Ponder.  Let's see it.  GO

21. There is **NO QUIT** in AD.  So good

22. How does Clay Aiken not get blocked?

23. I don't understand what they are doing.....

24. I wonder if the D can get a stop.  It would be pretty cool if they did

25. I'm happy about that stop.  I wonder if Ponder knows

26. Really don't want that penalty.  Was it on Asher?  I hate our CBs

27. Big big conversion.  Risky throw

28. Another one.  Keep it going!

29. And a shitty penalty :(

30. Nice throw and catch.  I like Camrillo.  Need more of him.  And a penalty on **THEM**  woohoo!

31. **WWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!**  That was **AWESOME!!!!!!!**

32. When he has the chance to play loose he's pretty good.  Need some HUGE defense

33. Alright....COME ON

34. **GET A STOP RIGHT HERE**

35. GOOD GOOD GOOD!

36. Holy shit that wasn't good.  At all.  Long way to go

37. Please don't pass it to Aromashadu ever again....Shaincoe is fine.  First Down!

38. Smart throwing it away.  AD isn't right.  TobyG please

39. CAMIRRILO AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHERE HAS HE BEEN AL FUCKING YEAR???!!?!? BENCHED FOR THAT IDIOT BERRIAN IS WHERE

40. DAMMIT!!!!!  

41.  Let's go D.  I don't like that call AT ALL

42. Uggg....uggg....ugggg.....ugggg

43. That was a helpful penalty.  I hope we get at least one chance on offense

44. Fuck

45.  Good game though...really it was.  I like what Ponder did for the most part.  With more practice and more experience we might have something here.  Today was the most fun I have had since game 1.  Even moreso than the win against the Cards.  It seems like there is now something to look forward to

Let me say something...if you are dependent on other teams' cast-offs you wade around in mediocrity. Look at the Redskins before this year, or Whoever....  

Look at the Super Bowl winners over the last decade...name the bigtime free agents on the Giants, Colts, etc. the Saints had a few but that's it. In this age of free agency you're screwed if you're building your team with players that aren't deemed worthy enough by their original team to keep around. 

So all these trouble cases and has-beens aren't going to fix what's wrong here. We're in this mess because our previous coach refused to address the long-term qb situation through the draft once everyone and their mother realized TJax sucked. It is of paramount importance to develop your own talent through the draft and undrafted free agents

So being the asshole that I am, I thought I might go dig up some statistics detailing some very key TEAM achievements since the NFL merger (a fair sample size in my opinion). I figured the merger should be where most statistics really start to count because I feel that prior to that, football was truly in its primitive form. Another reason to go from the merger is that the Vikings are a younger team when compared to Green Bay and Chicago, so it was a good base point where all franchises were up and running at the same time. This is not to say that it hasn't grown leaps and bounds since then, but here goes anyways:

**Since the NFL merger:**

*the Packers have won ~363 games and lost ~324*

*the Bears have won ~345 games and lost ~341*

*the Lions have won ~269 games and lost ~402*

*the Vikings have won ~386 games and lost ~305*

*these include postseason games

**Number of Winning seasons:**

Packers: *21*

Bears: *18*

Lions: *12*

Vikings: *26*

**Playoff Appearances:**

Packers: *17*

Bears: *14*

Lions: *10*

Vikings: *25*

**Playoff Wins:**

Packers: *16*

Bears: *10*

Lions: *1*

Vikings: *17*

**Superbowl Appearances/Wins:**

Packers: *3/2*

Bears: *2/1*

Lions: *0/0*

Vikings: *3/0*

Some of these statistics may be off a little

I encourage you to correct my stats if you know they are wrong

1366682790.0,1cwozs,Woe is the Vikings if they select Te'o - Alternative LB options.,,44,6,72,"Let's start with Te'o:

I really do not believe he will be a productive NFL player. He had a statistically productive senior campaign but the most impressive part of his season - his seven interceptions - is really unreliable. Interceptions are highly variable and a lot of the picks he had this season were the result of tipped balls at the line of scrimmage. He's also not a thumper; he's not one of those guys who will stick a running back and stop him in his tracks. He's a grab-and-drag tackler and that doesn't work as well at the next level. He's got second round value but most definitely should not be taken with either the 23rd or 25th picks.

So

Alec Ogletree: An obvious choice - widely considered the best ILB prospect in the draft

Arthur Brown: Again

Kevin Minter: I'm torn on Minter. The guy can hit

If we happen to miss on these guys another Linebacker I love that should be available at the end of the second round is Sio Moore out of UConn. Moore is awesomely athletic, showcasing his versatility and ability to grasp the responsibilities of multiple positions at a time - a trait that's hugely important for a middle linebacker. He's far from a perfect prospect and sometimes looks uncomfortable operating in space, but I think he'd be an interesting option if we were to miss out on Ogletree, Brown and Minter.

How about we calm down and stop taking bad penalties

Lucky lucky lucky so far.  LUCKY

Please give me more AD please please please Mr Bill...more more more.  RUN THE BALL ALL DAY!!!  And that's what Simpson brings

WOOOOOOHOOOOO EARLY LEAD!!!  I &lt;3 AD

I guess we forgot how to tackle when we forgot how to play penalty free football...Harrison Smith is awesome and announcer dude guy

Greenway in man coverage makes me sad

GOOD GOD WE NEED ANOTHER PAT WILLIAMS

WOOTS FUMBLE WOOT!

Oh LORD...Look

So, run the ball a bit, and don't pass so much

Here's the thing, so why the hell do we get away from our strengths???!?!

THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS

Harvin saves the day!  The man is amazing...and that drive was pretty nice.

And a nice defensive sequence.  I really miss Pat Williams.  Enough penalties...en - nough

I wonder if we'll try to score or just kill the clock.  All in all not an awful first half.  Except for that.  WTF PONDER

We are so f-ing lucky.  It's not even funny.  Someone might need to slap Ponder a few times at halftime.  So lucky

**I LOVE YOU HARRISON I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!**  ^^^nohomo  It's been a while since we've seen that.  Seems like forever

Ok D, by my unofficial count, the Vikings have a bazillion penalties for approximately 76 gigafazillion yards...good christ

That #26 guy is pretty damn good

Didn't douchebag color guy say he liked the idea of going for it when they were

Hey hey hey Ponder threw it away

**I'VE GOT AN IDEA!!!!  PETERSON IS SHREDDING THE DEFENSE SO LET'S TAKE HIM OUT OF THE GAME!!!  SO WE CAN GET KLUWE ON THE FIELD OBVIOUSLY.**  I know we're winning

""Jarred Allen with his fifth sack of the season and his fifth game in a row with ***at least*** a sack"" - Best quote of the day

I'm not even sure what I just watched on that last sequence

I want nachos...badly

We are doing just about everything we can to let the Cards make this game more interesting.  Thanks goodness the D is playing well 75% of the time

Did we inactivate Simpson at halftime???????????????????

Ponder has something wrong with his brain right now...this is the worst game he's played all year.  I hope he shakes it off because I have the feeling we're going to need him still

Anyone else just let out a HUGE sigh of relief?  Because

BTW

The Cards have a really good defense

Oh boy...oh boy

I'm nervous and anxious...way to start the game offense :(

Hey

Michael Jenkins continues to not suck...that was a really pretty pass and catch

RUDOLPH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was an amazing and incredible drive.  I'm not sure what to think

PONDER'S ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AND REMEDIED...HE NEEDED TO GET LAID WITHOUT RELIGIOUS GUILT

FYI: The Texans are like us

Wright does well with that

Not enough AD

Whoa Griffin

AJ AJ AJ YES!!!

Michael Jenkins doesn't suck

I now wish that Ponder had married sex before the season started

In Walsh we trust

Smith almost had that...the D looks incredible so far today

**PLAYOFF SCORE ALERT:  THE SAINTS NEED TO QUIT SCREWING US AND TAKE CARE OF THE COWBOYS...14-7 COWBOYS....ALSO

IDGAF Keep feeding AD please

Simpson needs to catch that

I love it when Ponder runs....he can and should do it more

blech...yuck...blag

This game is going by incredibly quickly  **AND WHERE IS COREYF??**  If he shows up make him go away again

Great return sets us up nicely

I'm not kidding at all...Ponder needed to get married 8 months ago.  This is night and day

And Everson is playing really well...like

**SAINTS TIE IT UP**

AD will go for 160 in the second half

Keep feeding AD and teach Simpson how to block

Nice drive again

Seriously

I hate Cobb.  LET'S RUIN RODGERS' BIRTHDAY

I DO like Josh Robinson

I'm going to say this one more time and that's it....WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN IF WE PLAY STUPIDLY

Pretty good coverage by Jefferson

No need to panic, no matter what the scoreboard says

FEED THE BEAST

Wright was WIDE open....sigh.  I hate how fast those 3 and outs seem.  Maybe we need to screw around more or something

So close...so freaking close

Big stop time!!!!!  Are we going to jump offside on EVERY SINGLE 3rd DOWN???  GOOD GOD.  Oh hey

Good stop.  Now Crosby can miss and we'll be ok.  FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

Keep doing this stuff...what we're doing now.  Please.

Nice little play there.  I liked that.  Simpson needs to block downfield better x 2

Good drive.  **BOOM BOOM BOOM**  Nice work!!!!!!!!!

Need some good defense here.  AND A STOP!  please punt it.  Ok whew

A) umm flag??? B) Aromashadu???  3) Ugg.  

Brinkley is the President of the Can't Tackle For Shit club.  ENOUGH OFFSIDES  ENOUGH ENOUGH ENOUGH.  Whew wow whew and Allen COME ON MAN!

OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**

ALLEN WITH THE PICK!!!  And crap.....  That was a TERRIBLE call.  Holy shit that was awful.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL WHAT THE HELL

Give me a GOD DAMN break.  Horseshit bullshit garbage.  Sorry for the cursing but holy crap that was awful.  A score before the half would be huge.  That call

Bad pass no time

Nice return Cobb

Hold them.  Boooooo.  Got to get to Rodgers better.  We're 6 inches and a quarter of a second away.  Frustrating 

Oh boy.  I hate this offsides day.  No good and GOOD HALF!!!!  Keep pounding them and punching them in the face.  Don't let up  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take care of the ball

Mason Crosby is having a very bad day

**AD AD AD!**  Someone buy that man a steak and let him sleep in

Dammit Christian.   Too easy and awful.  BAD BAD QB BAD

Defense please bail us out

So freaking close every stinking time.  Nice tackle

For the love of all that's good

Crosby time??  Or not.  They hate him.  STOP EM

The crappy Fox robot has a twitter account???  Hysterical.

Oh hey

Please stop throwing to Simpson x 2...Jesus.  Why no passes towards Wright?  Who, where are the designed throws to him?  I'm starting to have some bad feelings about this

INTERCEPTION BY SMITH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I feel some relief.  Crap.  Needed to convert there.  We can not keep letting them hang around.  A WR screen to Wright here and there would be freaking awesome.  Or a little flair to him.  Or how about a screen pass.  Anything

And seriously **I MISS PAT WILLIAMS**

I guess these previously horrible GB running backs are suddenly Emmit Smith.  This game is RIDICULOUS

Offsides.  Do we need a little luck?  We might

That was a good playcall and a not great pass.  Someone else might have caught it

All Day

Another lucky call.  I'll take it.  These refs are something else.  Ponder needs to be better.  This is getting inexcusable.  And there you go.  Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.  This is

Time to take Ponder out and sit him down.  That's it.  He NEEDS to be done for the week.  Period.  If you want to win THIS WEEK he should sit.  I know that Ponder has an incredibly long leash

So bad...so so bad.  We should be crushing them

What the hell

Well....I'm pretty speechless

What you got?

Why

Lucky that wasn't picked.  Are we going to get Ocho this week?  

**OH LOOK

Kick the FG

Miss...and there goes the game.  Not that there was much chance anyway

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK

A good wr will help us, them he isn't the QB I hoped he would be.  

I've been a huge supporter of his since we drafted him.  But he has gotten worse and worse and worse.  He's had one good game since week 5.  ONE.  And I know that we're rebuilding this year and so far we have exceeded expectations

My brain is about to explode.  I'll...umm....ufff.  This is by far without a doubt the WORST run defense we've had in 10+ years.  And they played really good run D for the first 4 games.  I don't understand one bit

They needed that pick.  Damn

THAT IS A NICE START!!!!  ALL DAY LEADING THE COMEBACK!

Now...defense needs to tackle the running back guy and we'll get the ball back quickly.  LOTS OF TIME

Just keep shooting yourself in the foot.  So gross",,t5_2qocl,1351222103.0,,vikingalienflair,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/123cyn/game_thread_vikings_vs_buccaneers_102512/
1351171532.0,122bhv,Are the surprising Vikings for real? (ESPN Insider),frownifdown,38,8,45,"[Here is the article](http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8547347/nfl-surprising-minnesota-vikings-real-contenders)

When I watched film of the Minnesota Vikings in the offseason, at least to this point of the season, the Vikings have surprised a lot of people with a 5-2 record. Now we are all asking ourselves if they are for real or just a nice little early-season story that will fade into the sunset. Let's examine six areas of this team to see if it can sustain its early success as the season moves forward.

1. Pass offense

This is a passing game with limited weapons. The Vikings have a young quarterback who was good early but has come back to reality in recent weeks. They may have the most conservative play calling of any pass offense in the NFL. No coaching staff asks less of its quarterback


In all fairness, he is pretty much the extent of the passing game's threats. Harvin is operating at wide receiver, out of the slot and even at running back, but almost all of his receptions are on safe/short passes designed to make it easy on Ponder and give Harvin a lot of yards after contact (YAC) opportunities. Tight end Kyle Rudolph is the next best option and has been great in the middle of the field, but he is starting to draw a lot of attention from defenses in recent weeks. After that, the passing threats are sketchy, although they hoped wide receiver Jerome Simpson could give them some vertical plays.

With an offense that is hard pressed to score a lot of points, and they need to get the ball into Harvin's hands near the goal line. What is troublesome is that Ponder is seeing great single matchups on the edges as defenses crowd the box to stop running back Adrian Peterson, and the quarterback is not making them pay. If those defenses can take Harvin out of the game, this pass offense is in big trouble.

2. Run offense

One of the biggest surprises in the NFL in the first seven weeks of the season is the positive production of Peterson after his devastating knee injury a year ago. He remains a violent runner

It is clear that the philosophy of this team is to try to get an early lead and then give the ball to Peterson to control the clock and close out the game. The Vikings will use more multi-TE sets to improve the run game

Toby Gerhart is a good change-of-pace power back

3. Pass defense

[+] Enlarge
Tom Dahlin/Getty Images
Antoine Winfield is solid in pass protection
This remains a Cover 2 defensive scheme by nature, their goal is to pin their ears back with a four-man rush that will play some games with twists and stunts on the way to the QB.

We see a lot of two-deep safeties, and if they do blitz they love to bring a defensive back, especially cornerback Antoine Winfield, off the edge or off the slot. They will also show some press looks with their corners in an effort to reroute receivers because they know they have safety help behind them.

They have two solid pass-defenders in the secondary in Winfield and safety Harrison Smith, this defense can keep the Vikings in a lot of games.

4. Run defense

A lot of people thought this defense would take its biggest hit in 2012 versus the run, they don't leave a lot of big lanes to fill. The defensive tackles inside stack well to allow the linebackers to flow to the ball, and the defensive ends on the edge, as well as Winfield, are excellent at coming down inside and tackling ball carriers before they get to the line of scrimmage.

What is really impressive is how well this unit tackles, led by inside linebacker Chad Greenway. You would expect this defense to continue to play well against the run, but good offenses may adjust to their pass-rush mentality when they are playing with a lead and gouge them up front with trap plays, whams, etc.

5. Special teams

The kicking game gives the Vikings a chance to actually stay in some games against superior opponents. With an offense that is challenged to produce a lot of scoring

The blocking for the return game a year ago was not consistent enough with a lot of young players, giving a lift to a struggling offense.

6. The future schedule

The good news for the Vikings is they have unexpected wins over San Francisco and Detroit that helped get them to their surprising 5-2 record. The bad news is the rest of their schedule is brutal

The winnable games look like Tampa Bay (home) this weekend, and it's unlikely we will see three teams from the NFC North make it to the postseason.

Do the Chiefs have a good TE?  I don't know this.  I bet I'll know his name by the end of the game.  *sigh*

Tim Brewster is the sideline reporter??!?!?!?  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Game on

1. I don't know if I can be less excited to see McNabb today

2. Way to lose a yard on a swing pass.

3. **HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT PLAY WAS CALLED??!?!?**  Oh God this might be a long afternoon

4. All in all the special teams have been good.  They get a pass

5. SACK and a facemask....penalties will kill us

6. Nice sackish kind of thing except when we let them get a first down the next play

7. It's not the second half.  WTF is going on?

8. OOOOOO  OOOO   OOOOOOOOOOOOO  DAMN.  Aww

9. This Prius commercial is creepy as fuck

10. Did anyone watch Land of the Lost last week?  I have it on my DVR.  Is it worth 2 hours of my life?

11. Nice to see Peterson's here today

12. We love running that sweep

13. And a penalty

14.  Perfect!!!  Berrian's final reception before the bye week is called back!!

15. Good good run.  Do you think Peterson ever wants to punch McNabb in the face?  I think he does...often

16. FIRST DOWN!!!!  it's the little things

17.  **TOUCHDOWN BY ONE OF THE EX-BEAR WIDE RECEIVERS BOTH OF WHOM NOTORIOUSLY DROP THE BALL ALL TIME TIME!!!**  That play was amazing on many different levels.  Nice score.  Now McNabb's job is safe for another week because *look what amazing things he is capable of*

18. D looks decent today

19. I've said it before

20. Nice stop D

21. Peterson *could* have a huge game today...*could*

22. OH NO!  We DO NOT need an o-line injury...at all

23. KYLE RUDOLPH IS GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

24. That was terrible.  Look, but sheesh.

25. oh no...not a fumble...oh no

26.  Subreddit is quiet today

27. NOT A FUMBLE!  Get the review right! Whew

28. OMG OMG OMG.  Someone is retarded...it's McNabb or Peterson.  OMG

29. OHOLY SHIT!!!  OH FFS!!!!!!!!!!  Nice tackle by McNabb

30. ......

31. I'm just....something....stop them

32. nice pressure.  nice pressure

33. WTF was that?  I'll take it

34. It's never good when your QB and coach yell at each other on the sideline

35. Nice catch Harvin.  McNabb might have figured out that Percy isn't 6'6"" this week.  Good to learn things

36. Here's a question I have...what are McNabb's hot reads?  It seems like he is totally lost when there is blitz pressure.

37. Let's shut em down before half!

38. Another dumbass penalty

39. B-ROB AND JA!!!!!!!!!!  Nice nice nice!

40. Good tackle by Winfield

41. SHUT DOWN!!!

42. AND WE'RE DOWN AT HALF FOR THE FIRST TIME ALL YEAR!!!!!  This ***has*** to be a good thing....right?  right??

43. As bad a KC has looked

I don't feel good.  Bad turnover and bad bad penalties

1. Run D has been awesome

2. Close...good stop

3. WHERE'S THE FLAG!??!?!!!!!  Oh...there it is

4. Gotta keep feeding Peterson the ball.  Especially if he keeps getting 4 yards per

5.  I keep getting so nervous everytime McNabb throws the ball...I have zero trust in him

6. lkfjdsal;kfjdslak;fjdka;lsjfdkls;ajfdkljnmckxnzmclk cknajkfdkdskan  I hate him

7. Maybe if we hadn't seen Farve meltdown so badly last year I would have more patience.  But Donovan keeps missing what should be routine throws.  Completely missing them.  It is so very disheartening as a fan to see shit like this.  What more does he have to do to get benched.  It's like he has one good play per game and then stinks it up the rest of the time and the coaching staff gives him a pass.  It's depressing.  Look, but it's like, how bad does he need to be to get benched.  This falls on the coaching staff fully and solely.  Perhaps Ponder isn't ready, then put Webb in.  He can't do any worse and at least his excellent mobility can make up for some of how bad the o-line is.  I have 100% had it

8. Uggg.....DAMMIT.  UUUUUGGGGG

9. GET UP GREENWAY!!!!!!!!!  He walked off on his own

10. Where is the block in the back there?  Where's the call??

11. **WATCH FOR THE FAKE!**  And omg he made it?  Now we have to score.  This is terrible

12. **ANOTHER FUCKING PENALTY EVERY DAMN GAME THIS STUFF KILLS US**

13. Berrian is no where near the ball...terrible pass.  I'm depressed officially now and a crappy 3rd down pass.

14. Is Kluwe the only one on the punt team that can tackle now?  Amazing

15. Should be and is offensive pass interference.  That's a huge helper

16. It doesn't matter.  At all.  Huge first down by KC.

17. Time to come up big D.  Good work.  Will they go for it?  Watch for the fake

18. Big stand defense.  Now let's march down the field and score a TD....AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...no I'm serious...AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH :(

19. WWOOOOHOOOOO PERCY! And nevermind..........incomplete

20. Yep...he could have run for it.  **GET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF THERE NOW.  THIS TEAM HAS NO LIFE WITH HIM IN THERE.  NONE.  THEY HAVE THE ENERGY LEVEL OF A SLEEPY SLOTH.  GET HIM OUT**

21. OMG  Flag?  Nevermind.  I have no idea what is going on.  Griffen just stumbled.  *sighsighsigh*.  The D is tired.  That should not have happened

22. **HOW CAN YOU PUT MCNABB IN????  HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW???**

23. Nice run Percy...very nice

24. What?  Wha.....  :(:(:(:(:(

25. HOLY SHIT BERRIAN!  

26. Ok ok ok.  This isn't terrible

27. Look at that

28. Sooo close.  Try again!

29. I don't care at this point.  Do it again

30. Thank God

31. OK D...time for a bigtime stand.  You can do it

32. Got them pushed back...let's see what the D can do

33. Whew...need more pressure

34. OKOKOKOKOK...ONE MORE STOP!  AND THEY CALL A TIMEOUT!!!!!!  THANKS A LOT!

35. STOPPED!!!!!!!!!

36. Need some o.  Let's see what we can do.  And

37. We have a long long way to go.  But we have a lot of time.  

38. Keep going...keep going

39. **PERCY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

40. Come on let's f'ing go!

41. Eww...more better passes we need

42. WTF DEFLECTIONS!!!!!!

43. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

44. Don't throw it to him again.  He caught his biweekly pass already

45. I.....I....... :(

46. That sequence sums up

47. Game over................................................................................

Frazier will be fired unless things turn around.  He has to see this.  I don't care that McNabb had one good drive and one other good pass.  It is simply not enough.

We are now playing for draft picks and next year.  It's that simple.  We need to play our young guys and see what we have.

1353887399.0,13s78e,I can't even blame Ponder for this one...,bagmagick,31,5,35,"
* I can’t put the blame on Ponder for this one. No, and he didn’t have nearly the kind of time you’d like to see someone have. “But Kaepernick lit up the same defense!” There were two things that Kaep had that Ponder doesn’t, which ties to my next two points:

* Receivers? Pardon the upcoming French, but if you factor in drops, Ponder’s accuracy would have been closer to 65%, which is respectable. Listen, Jerome Simpson, you are supposed to be a #2 receiver on this team. You can’t drop passes that hit you dead square in the chest. You can’t. That’s how you lose your job. I’d be okay with cutting you tomorrow, for how little you produce for the offense. John Carlson? Terrible. He’ll be gone from this team by next year. Stephen Burton, has dropped his only targets two games in a row. That’s not how you make a team as a receiver. At least we know now that Jarius Wright definitely has the goods. Kyle Rudolph is an above-average pass-catching tight end. But he’s hurt now. Great. This was a team that desperately missed a reliable chain-moving

* The Playcalling? Bill Musgrave needs to go. Many fans are upset about the series in which the Vikes went out in a shotgun formation and failed to produce on 3rd and 2 and 4th and 2. We have Adrian Peterson. It shouldn’t even be a difficult call. Listen

Those two factors account for the offensive struggles. Had we been running more often and had receivers been catching the passes they were targeted on

* But where was the pass rush? What’s wrong with this unit? They produced so much more effectively in the past. The personnel is the same

I think these are the factors that led to today’s outcome. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

TL;DR: Ponder looked *okay, and what the heck is wrong with the defensive line?",,False,,t5_2qocl,False,jersey28,

[Mine has got to be Jared Allen vs Donald Penn during the Tampa Bay game.](http://www.vikings.com/media-vault/videos/Allen-Gets-Bloodied-vs-Tampa-Bay/f321fb02-36b8-49bb-8723-2700dc2d8e30)

Jared Allen and Donald Penn got in a scuffle. Penn started throwing hands and Jared responded in kind. Jared's helmet ended up on the ground and his nose was bloodied. I've never seen Jared Allen so pissed.

The home crowd was going insane after the refs sorted things out. 3rd and 10. We're down by 13 near the end of the 3rd quarter. 

Tampa Bay has to call a timeout because of the noise. The crowd gets even louder. When the Bucs gets back on the field

Alan Williams made a unique decision and put *both* Jared Allen and Everson Griffen on the right side. They both fire off the line

Other than AP's final run against Green Bay for the record, and then I was defiantly ecstatic when Jared blew past Penn for the sack. I know it doesn't look special in the video, but this was a 5-6 minute ordeal in real time. And considering the preceding events, Jared was running off pure anger and adrenaline, and *it was awesome.*",,False,t5_2qocl,True
