1375721348.0,1jqz5b,I've had it.,SiriusC,273,137,303,"I want to put this sentiment at the top: **The goal here isn't to *just* bitch. If I could get anything out of this

First of all

A lot has been talked about concerning the comparison of EU Plus to NA Plus. I was actually feeling great about my subscription until a user posted an image [comparing EU to NA since the IGC started](http://i.imgur.com/9L97fKm.jpg). Our highest rated PS3 game (Metacritic score of 90 &amp; above) in the last year has been **PACMAN**. EU had 6 titles above 90, God of War, Okami HD, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus HD, &amp; Mass Effect 3**. We did beat them in one category though: we had twice the amount of games that were rated at 80 or *below*. 6 of which weren’t even rated (Fuseball, anyone?).

[The newest NA offering](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/08/05/ps-plus-august-preview-hitman-absolution-free-for-members-tomorrow/) has a AAA title that EU received in the past, a second go-round with Machinarium but this time on the Vita, &amp; another Pinball game. I don't even own a Vita, but I find myself being outraged that they're getting what seems like the 20th fighting game. As far as PS3 goes:

For the month of August

* Hitman: Absolution
* Zen Pinball 2: Star Wars (3 DLC boards for Zen Pinball 2)
* Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien

EU is getting:

* Need for Speed: Most Wanted
* Mafia 2
* Spec Ops: The Line

Those are 3 AAA/retail games EU is getting while we have 1 AAA/retail title along with a couple side games at best. I hear Runner2 is good, but there's such a large gap in terms of quality. The Vita thing alone is ridiculous. 

Morgan Haro insists he passes on the word of what we think about Plus &amp; what we would like to see from it, intelligently, &amp; reasonably express our views. I haven't really thought about the logistics yet &amp; would love to hear some suggestions, but it'll be well thought out. Maybe a ""we the undersigned"" letter/email or... something. This is about the only thing that I can think of that might have a more direct effect than posting on the blog.

**TL

Sorry to bitch

---

Edit 1: I'm aware that we got Spec Ops. That isn't the point. The exact title is irrelevant. It's the caliber of game I'm pointing out.

Edit 2: The greater goal here is to get out of the realm of online bitching &amp; in to something where we really are heard &amp; we get a real response. I would still love to hear ideas of effective ways to do this. In the meantime

Edit 3: I'm not *exactly* saying, &amp; repeats on different formats while our EU sibling is getting the cream at the top. And there is a heavy load of bullshit concerning the odd amount of PSP fighting games. At this point it seems like an ongoing practical joke.

If I could get anything out of this

Edit 4: Some formatting &amp; cleaning up

Edit 5: It was pointed out to me that the Pinball game isn't so much of a game on it's own as it is just 3 boards for the F2P Zen Pinball 2. So we're basically getting DLC instead of a full game on its own.

Edit 6 (huff! puff!): Stop telling me &amp; us that we should not buy it &amp;/or switch to EU like it's a real solution. I thought it was basic knowledge that they won't allow you to cancel. Every PSN purchase is final. Many of us are long term customers &amp; we stack the time when a sale comes about. I'm currently signed up through July 2014 &amp; I bought all this time around Feb 2013. We do this because we have faith &amp; love in the service. But then this happens &amp; we're left feeling underwhelmed

Edit 7: I find it interesting that Morgan hasn't responded to any backlash on the blog. There are currently 5 replies up there between 2 different people &amp; none of them are in response to the anger over getting another fighting game. There's quite a bit of that if you go through the pages. Maybe he's *busy* but it should really be acknowledged.",,t5_2u8bb,1375795661.0,,psplus,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1jqz5b/ive_had_it/

### [Sleeping Dogs](http://i.imgur.com/MwBCO42.jpg)

***

&gt; Inspired by classic Hollywood and Asian cinema style action thrillers, through its neon-lit side streets and sprawling street markets, an incredible story unfolds of loyalty and betrayal where Wei begins to question his own motives as he is sucked in deeper than he could ever imagine.

&gt; Offering players an island packed with action, harbor dock or city skyscraper can become an opportunity for intense shoot-outs, adrenaline-fueled street races and intense, brutal martial arts combat. Featuring one of the most intuitive and imaginative combat systems, Sleeping Dogs empowers players to perform an extensive set of martial arts moves, singlehandedly taking on numerous opponents. Players perform bone-crunching kicks and combos, vicious counters and a cinematic set of environmental takedowns making use of countless real-world items from circular saws to phone booths

Sleeping Dogs was first made available to North American PS+ subscribers in May 2013 and European subscribers in February 2013.

* On the PS3

* Register the new account to an UK address. I just googled a hotel in London and used that address. For my email address I just used my gmail account with ""+UK"" before the @ symbol. (More info on this [here.)](http://lifehacker.com/144397/instant-disposable-gmail-addresses)

* Login to the [Sony Store](http://sonyentertainmentnetwork.com) with your new login ID.

* Go to Wallet &gt; Add funds. From here you can choose to use Paypal. I just added £50.00 to my wallet.

* Sign into the store via your PS3 and purchase Plus.

I'm downloading a few things now. I hope it goes well.

**Edit:** As Yonnzl [points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17q5vq/na_thinking_of_getting_an_eu_account_heres_how_i/c87yxml) this is a breach of the Terms of Service and technically you could get in trouble with Sony. Sign up for an EU account at your own risk.

**Edit 2:** A few redditers are having some problems getting this to work. I'm not exactly sure what the problem is. As of 2/17/13 I am still able to add funds and use the UK service normally.

**Edit 3:** It seems as of 03/15/13 the method described above no longer works for adding funds to your Wallet. The work around seems to be this.

Follow the first two steps as outlined above. 

Next go to ~~[game.co.uk]~~ [pcgamesupply.com](http://www.pcgamesupply.com/buygames/sony-playstation-network-cards/) and purchase **downloadable** codes. They seem to be out of actual ps+ membership codes but you can buy ""Wallet Top Ups"" for different amounts. I used my debit card to pay ~~game.co.uk~~ pcgamesupply as I got an error from paypal saying something about paypal not allowing me to ship to the UK. I'm not sure what it meant by that but

The download code page should appear after the payment is processed(you'll also receive it in an email ).

### [Spec Ops: The Line](http://i.imgur.com/M1Pvy1w.jpg)

***

&gt; Spec Ops: The Line is a provocative and gripping third-person modern military shooter that challenges players' morality by putting them in the middle of unspeakable situations where unimaginable choices affecting human life must be made.

&gt; Spec Ops: The Line unfolds within the destroyed opulence of Dubai. Once the playground for the world's wealthiest elite

&gt; While most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the sandstorms swept through, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to infiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home. Players will experience ""The Line"", that razor's edge known only to men who deal in war. It is the line they cross when death and duty become one and the same. It is the end -- of self and sanity -- when their duty is done and only they remain. 

Spec Ops: The Line was first made available to North American PS+ users in March 2013.

download the game and attach it to your character at your leisure.

1368672660.0,1efeof,How to Upgrade the PS3 HDD to Larger Size,volpes,32,4,18,"Since it is really easy to fill up your hard drive with the PS+ service

Steps for upgrading your PS3 harddrive:

1.  Select a hard drive.  The hard drive needs to be a standard laptop/notebook drive that is 2.5” wide and 9.5mm thick.  Pay attention to the thickness, the connection needs to be SATA, which is pretty standard.  The last consideration is speed.  The drive that comes with the PS3 only runs at 5400 RPM.  A 7200 RPM hard drive will have faster read/write, but will produce more heat.  Since my PS3 already doubles as a George Foreman grill, I chose to keep the slower speed.  This led me to the 750GB WD Blue notebook drive (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136546).

2.  If you want the old data and patches from your old PS3 drive, you are ready to switch drives.  It is worth noting at this point that there is a list of things that won’t backup--namely trophies and DRM content (see the full list here https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/798/~/ps3-backup-utility).  Trophies should first be synced to the PSN, and DRM content (like downloaded movies) will need to be re-downloaded after you complete the switch.  Skip to step 4.

3.  Reformatting to FAT32.  New versions of Windows will format drives automatically to NTFS.  This file system has some nice security features and large file storage options, you should backup your external drive somewhere else (Yes, I realize I’m asking you to backup a drive so you can use it to backup another drive).  Windows comes with a reformatting tool you can access by cmd prompt, but it can’t handle large drives.  So you’ll need to download a 3rd party utility to do the conversion.  You can find any number of free tools online, but I used this one (http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=304&amp;sid=34) and vouch that it worked fine on my WD external drive.  Run the tool, reformat the external hard drive, then go back to reading step 2.

4.  Physically switching the drive.  First, then finish them with a screwdriver or your fingers.  Remove the hard drive tray, remove the old hard drive from the tray, insert the new drive, and reinsert the tray into the PS3.  You might take this opportunity to vacuum out the dust if you haven’t done it in awhile.

5.  Formatting the PS3 drive.  I didn’t have to do this

6.  Restoring the PS3 backup data.  Now this is getting easy.  Go back through the steps you took to backup the PS3

7.  You are ready to play!  If you want to

When I first joined I was very skeptical at the time. Games given out were small titles and minis. Lots and lots of minis. A trend was appearing when PS1 classics came about; then IGC. The service has saved me some money on titles I would have bought. A great service by Sony indeed.

Building upon PAC-MAN Championship Edition’s original six courses, the new game features more than 100 varied and mind-boggling mazes to navigate. Several new modes will also be available to test a player's pellet-munching aptitude. In Time Attack Mode, players will vie for the quickest clear time. Fulfill a series of objectives in Mission Mode or compete to devour the most number of ghosts gobbled in Ghost Mode.

&gt; With brand new visual variations and music

Pac-Man Championship Edition DX was first made available to North American PS+ users in July 2012.  It is currently the highest Metacritic-rated PSN title given out on PS+ even earning a rare perfect 10/10 from IGN.

&gt;  LittleBigPlanet 2 empowers users to create their own levels by utilizing a variety of developer tools as well as various games like top-down racing games, RPGs and more. The game begins with a unique story mode that provides a beautifully reshaped world for Sackboy to explore and play. Each story level is influenced by cultural high points in history.

&gt; Players can reset the controller buttons for any object and change the rules to any level through an ability called Direct Control and multiplayer abilities advance the types of games possible for a social/competitive experience. Users are able to link levels together to provide longer gameplay experiences without the breakup of going back to the Pod and can see what LittleBigPlanet 2 levels/games their friends are playing via activity steams. 

LittleBigPlanet 2 was first made available to North American and European PS+ users in June 2012 with the launch of the Instant Game Collection.

Sorry for asking this kind of questions

So I want to get PS+ but I'm curious about how it works.

When I select ""Free Games"", inFamous 2 and some other games.

But If I browse the store

Are those some kind of left overs from past months? Will I be able to play them if they're not in the current ""Free"" list?

How long they will be there? I've read what PS+ is getting new games as early as 6th of March. Or there is some games which are always free for PS+?

Also I've heard what I can download the free game and it will be available for me as long as I'm subscribed to PS+

My main one is the EU account and this is where I subscribed to PS+. 

The other day i logged on to my US account and 'discovered' 23USD which i must have left from an old PSN card purchase or something.

So now the question - do i just keep the money there? do i buy stuff on the PSN store to that amount or should I top it to 50USD and get another PS+? 

The value of PS+ seems to be much higher than whatever i could get for 23 or even 50 usd and there is enough difference between the offering on both to make it an interesting option...

I reorganized the data from their [official PS+ listing page](http://www.jp.playstation.com/psn/plus/list/) mainly to get a quick look at what's available and what's expiring when. I included some info about each game like the filesize and the listed price to be able to guess which 'class' the game belongs to and what kind of game it's likely to be replaced with. For example, and it is the only full-size Platinum-trophy-packing PS3 game in the list, all of which gives me the impression that when it expires in a week a similar 'class' game will replace it (though nothing is certain).

Some extra things - the CERO ratings are like Japan's ESRB. A is for all ages, which is right between ESRB's *T* and *M*. And D is 17+, which is equivalent to an *M*. 

The columns on the right show which dates you can still obtain the game freely as a PS+ member. The Japanese PS+ is updated once a month in the middle of the month. The current period ends on June 18, giving you almost a month to enjoy two months worth of content.

Bonus information: according to the Japanese PS+ site

I think it's worth mentioning that if you're not in Japan, but even those require hiragana/katakana understanding so if that's missing take this as a fair warning heads up - getting lost in menus and indecipherable text would not be what I'd call a fun time.

As for funding your account if you happen to be outside of Japan

For example. Let's say the new Cod:Ghosts was finished a month before the release date. Sony could release the game in a locked state on PSN a week before to let people download it and when the release date arrives the game automatically unlocks itself. I think that this would be a nice feature to have considering that some games can be up to 20gb and that it would be more convenient for those with slow download speeds to download the game before hand and play it at launch without spending time to download and install it.


This has happened with Tales of Xillia which was in the psn store for a little while because of an error and Sony quickly fixed this by locking the game.

### [Uncharted: Golden Abyss](http://i.imgur.com/Ujve12Y.jpg)

***

&gt; Uncover the dark secret behind the 400-year-old massacre of a Spanish expedition as Nathan Drake follows the murderous trail of an ancient and secret Spanish sect in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. Caught in the middle of a rivalry between Jason Dante -- his old friend -- and Marisa Chase -- the granddaughter of an archaeologist who has mysteriously vanished without a trace -- Nathan Drake races into the treacherous river basins

&gt; Developed by award-winning Sony Bend Studio, highly-detailed environments, and special effects that truly captures the look and feel of the Uncharted universe. 

Uncharted: Golden Abyss is currently the best-selling game of all-time for the Vita and one of just three to retail over for more than $40 at release.  It was first made available in November 2012 to PS+ users in North America and Europe with the launch of the Instant Game Collection for Vita.

Anyways, before disappearing and a different bunch of games becomes available for a month. Am I right so far?

I also heard that as long as I download a little bit of an instant game collection game, stop the download, then in a years time resume the download and install the game? Hoping this is right because it sounds awesome if it's true. I'll probably even download a little bit of loads of Vita games, in case I ever buy a Vita.

And, I can't even attempt to download Uncharted 3 for example as I don't have 12GB free space. However after attempting to download Uncharted, underneath the download link, where it would say ""~~£39.99~~ +Free"" it now says ""Purchased"". Am I right in thinking that because it says it's purchased I can download the game entirely in a couple months time when I get my new HDD? Bear in mind I haven't even started downloading it as it wouldn't let me. If it's mine forever just by clicking to download it I'm just going to get everything then download them all when I get my new Hard Drive.

I know that some of these deals are over, I hope that I can help you decide if a game is worth your time. This list is only for the Vita, if people are interested in one for the ps3 games I'd be glad to do that too.


If you are not interested in reading about what I feel are the good parts and bad parts of a bunch of fighting games

Before I talk about the games themselves


So far for the Vita the following fighting games have been free:

Tekken 6

Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny

BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend




1. Tekken 6

I have been a fan of the Tekken series for a long time. The first that I played was T2, but not really 4. I happened to be in Japan when T6 came out in arcades, played it and loved it. Bought it as soon as it came out for ps3. Got a character card and played at arcades a lot. I was a little hesitant about the PSP/Vita version at first, but it was free so I figured hey, what the heck. 


***The Good Things***

1. Tekken 6 has some really nice controls. If you haven't played Tekken games before

2. Increased the character roster. There are a lot of unique characters

3. Simple but deep. Tekken uses only 4 buttons, but incredibly deep once you start to really get into it

4. Character customization. There is so much stuff you can buy to make your character look how you want. There is funny stuff, etc, and they items can be unlocked by playing the game so you don't need to spend real money

5. Load times. Load times are far shorter than the PS3 version. 

***The Not as Good Things***

1. Graphics not as good as the ps3

2. No online play. This was the biggest disappointment for me. I know Tekken 6 is an older PSP game

3. Saving up money can be tedious. Everything in the shop

4. Less modes and less costumes. A few modes were taken away from the ps3 version

**Verdict:**

If you like Tekken 6 a lot, if you are like me, and the only person in your friend group who plays fighting game, I'd recommend the PS3 version over this. It's cheap, offers a lot more, and if you install it's not too bad on the load time.

. 2. Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny

Similar to Tekken, but with a more fantasy element. Instead of different fighting styles, characters have different weapons which gives each character a unique style. 


***The Good Things***

1. Easy to get into. Similar to Tekken, kick, and block). Whether you're a button masher or a pro, you can enjoy SC. 

2. Lots of customization from the get go. In SC you can make your own character, you can choose from a multitude of options right from the start

3. Full fledged tutorial teaching you how to play. Everything from the most basic to advanced techniques can be learned by playing the games gauntlet challenge mode. 


***The Not as Good Things***
1. No online. Ug. 

2. Fewer characters than console games. 

3. Custom characters kind of ugly. 

**Verdict**
If you are new to the SC series you should definitely pick it up to see if you like the fighting style

. 3. BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend

I. Love. BlazBlue. I played the first game SO MUCH. I played a lot of guilty gear and was so excited when BB came out, but very different from SF/KoF and other 2d fighters. BB uses A,B,C and D, to attack, and each character has special ""drive techniques"" that make them very unique. It you have played Gulty Gear, you will find some characters to be similar to characters of that franchise. 

***The Good Things***

1. Character selection. BB: CSE features all of the characters from the first game(calamity trigger) and all of the DLC characters you had to buy for the PS3 version of CS

2. Variety. Every character is different. Each characters drive and special moves are different

3. Game play modes. Arcade mode

4. Online play! Excellent net code makes for great online matches.

5. Amazing music

***The Not as Good Things***

1. Character customization. You can do palette swaps

2. Steep learning curve on some characters. Having a general knowledge of fighting game types will help you

3. Controls(only for a few characters) The game was designed for the arcade

**Verdict**

BB is in my opinion the strongest fighting game offered so far. It's fun, and the only game to have online play. If you don't like a humorous story and anime style graphics you might not like it. 

Well that's all! I hope that this wasn't a huge waste of your time. Let me know what you think,NA,False,,t5_2u8bb,False,,True
