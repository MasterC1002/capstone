**The Hammock**

*Types of Hammocks*

There are three main types of hammocks:

* The gathered-end, cost, and weight. It is possible to lie flat in these, but does take tweaking. For this, most users sleep on a diagonal. 
* The bridge hammock
* The spreader-bar hammock is what you typically find in folks' backyard. because this type of hammock attempts to allow you to lie-flat with a high center of gravity, and stake them into the ground.
 
Other types of hammocks exist (like the [Bat Hammock](http://www.mosquitohammock.com/bathammock.html) used in mountain climbing) but are much less prevalent

_

A lot of folks on here are partial to the [Eagle Nest Outfitters (ENO) Doublenest](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLENEST.html), and have slept in it before, even with another person. Wasn't too bad. Woke up a little stiff, but it was ok. 

There are plenty of other brands out there

So maybe you've had a hammock for a year or two and want to make your own

Here's a [great little DIY from Knotty](https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php?t=15205) at HF. This is for a gathered-end hammock, but after ripping a few bedsheets, I think I'll sew some nylon now. 

For this, but will hold heavier loads. For the ends, you'll want some paracord. 

Then

For the more advanced

_

**Suspension**

Once you have your hammock, and attach to your hammock. Being that they're wider than rope, they will do less damage to the tree. *Note: Apparently Slapstraps have a reputation for stretching. I will say that this has not happened with my Slapstrap Pros, but know that the hazzard is there.*

Another option to to get tree straps and [Whoopieslings](http://whoopieslings.com/images/p1010492_dk13.jpg).^(image credit: Whoopieslings.com) This is a light-weight, get yourself some Amsteel Blue. about 13' yields 6' slings. 

Whoopieslings can either attach to your tree straps by carabiner

Are you in a rockier region? Do you want to set up over a creek or stream

_

**Bugnet**

You can have either a detatched bug net, and possibly fall. All preference. 

Again

_

**Tarp**

Tarps are good because

These come in many, and fabrics. This all leads to different weights and so forth. Shug does a great deal of explaining how to set these up in his videos, which I will link below. There's just too much variability to get in-depth here. 

Some Basics

* Asymmetrical tarps are like rectangles. These are hung over a line and the corners don't line up on opposite sides of your hammock. Light-weight
* Symmetrical tarps tend to be diamond-shaped and line up. A little more protection
*Rectangular  tarps tent to be draped over a line “hotdog” style

If you're car-camping, cheap fly for your first outing, you can easily modify a roofing tarp for this purpose. Videos of this exist on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqaSYONkTFQ), but you might as well just make (or buy) a good tarp your first time through. 

_

**Ridgelines**

There are two times of ridgelines: structural and non-structural. 

* Structural ridgelines tent to be tied just inside the hammock suspension, allowing you to lie flat. Often you can hang a mini-hammock or cargo pouch from this line for easy access. 
* Non-structural ridgelines tend to be tied to the tree lower than your suspension lines, since you must hang your hammock high for a good hang. (Picture below)

_

*Tarps: under or over the ridgeline?*

This now opens the debate of how you hang your tarp: under the ridgeline or over. Either way works. Some folks like over the line

There is a third option, but gives you one more piece of rope to leave behind in camp when moving on. 

_

To avoid rain
 	
Set your tarp out past your hammock's ends by about a foot (see photos and Shug). 
Add drip lines. These are simple pieces of cord that hang down off of your suspension and tarp ridgeline. As water falls down the line

_

**Bedding**

Keeping warm in a hammock below 60 degrees F is a bit tough. Since your but hangs out, since by sleeping in the bag, you compress the fill, losing a lot of the heat retention properties. 

One solution is a foam or inflatable sleeping pad. You've probably used these while ground camping. Slip one of these (no too inflated

Some folks add a sleeve to the underside of their hammock for their pad. I think that gives you less control over your pad

In colder weather, letting your hammock keep the pressure off the insulation, while keeping you snug and warm. You can get these in full length, ¾, or ½ length. This is a personal preference issue, with weight and cost being factors. I've honestly, in a pinch, so that it reached from neck to thighs

Another method is to modify their sleeping bags to fit around their hammocks. This is great

For the top half of your body, just use a sheet and skip the bottom layers (though a pad can help you to lie flat). In colder months, a sleeping bag works, but the weight-conscious tend to prefer a topquilt. This is a one-sided sleeping bag that may or may not have a foot box, and is used to keep your heat in. It can be filled with down or synthetic materials, and designs on this vary about as much as anything else in the hammocking world. 

_

**Your Gear**

You've got your hammock set up, but you may want some stuff a little more accessible. If you're backpacking, you are going to need to do something with your pack. 

For small items, sometimes tapered stuff-sack that hangs in the top of your hammock, by the gathered end, and allows you easy access to clothes, light, book, water bottle, and this sack

As for your pack, and in easy reach. [Just Jeff](http://www.tothewoods.net/HomemadeGearPackCoverGearHammock.html) has a DIY on how to make a pack cover that doubles as a gear hammock! 

If you don't want to add weight to your rig and more chord to the mix

The third possibility (and least preferable to most) is to string your gear up with your bear bag. Just hope you don't forget anything! 


_

**Storage**

How do you store your gear

Well, especially the all-in-one kits come with larger sacks for everything. A design marketed by Hennesy is the [Snake Skin](http://hennessyhammock.com/catalog/products/snakeskins-xl/). These are a pair of nylon tubes that encompass your hammock and allow you to tie it to your supports without letting it touch the ground. Once you tie the hammock up, you pull back the skins, and out drops your hammock! There are plans out there for wider skins to hold your hammock, tarp, bugnet, and quilts

A similar concept, or simply the Bishop Bag. This is a stuff sack with a hole burned, cut, stitched, grommeted, or created in some other way in the bottom of the sack. This allows your cord(s) to stick out of the bottom of the bag to allow you to tie up your first end, and then simply open the sack, this is arguably easier to make

These two options allow you to set your sleep site up in under three minutes

_

**Misc**

Here are some final thoughts on hammock set-ups. Some of these may seems like no-brainers

* In campsites that say nothing can be hung from trees
* Follow-up, and just take down you actual hammock and tarp, etc. 
* Look out for widow-makers! When setting up your camp, and will lead to a less-than-fun camping experience. 
* Don't set up near the fire. Nylon is flammable. 
* There are some people who like to carry a small floor mat to place next to their hammock. This allows them to stand on something other than dirt/ grass when their shoes are off so that they don't track anything into the hammock. 
* If using 'biners in your rig
* Like tent camping, when you get out of bed, you don't need to put your boots on right away. This also allows your feet to air out, warding off potential foot funk. The bonus with hammock camping is that you can clip your shoes off the ground, so if it rains, they're not getting wet. 
* Try to observe Leave No Trace principles when backpacking. That's just a given. ",self,t5_2s7lm,1363367234.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hammocks/comments/1a7zz8/onestop_intro_to_hammocks_post/

the 6 mods all quit because the owner stopped sharing what he did with all of the ""donations"".  a few hours later and all that's left is a 404.  
Here is the original message from moderator JustJeff:


Dear HammockForums.net members

In October 2006, originality and respectful discourse, Hammock Forums grew into a unique community that many members proudly say is the best forum on the internet.

Integrity has always been the foundation of our operations here, and the moderator staff being as transparent as possible in the site's operations.

One key aspect of the site's operations that deserves special scrutiny is the donation procedures. The mod staff historically has proudly proclaimed that we moderate Hammock Forums on a strictly volunteer basis

This is because several months ago, and given an ultimatum that without access - not even spending authority, but only access to view - we can no longer moderate this website with the integrity we require. We offered several opportunities to remedy this situation but were rebuffed each time.

Therefore, NCPatrick, Cannibal, headchange4u, and John Sawyer - are resigning as Hammock Forums' moderators. We stand in agreement that if we cannot keep our word to the members, we will no longer represent their website. Furthermore, if the owner will not keep his word to us, integrity is more important than participation in any website.

We're sure Hammock Forums will continue without us and we wish you all the best in the future.
