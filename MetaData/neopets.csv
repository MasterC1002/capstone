As the title states I used to hack Neopets accounts

I've made over ~35billion neopoints in 2 years (on my own accounts), basically everything Neopets has ever offered.

I quit about 2 years or so ago. And I'm here mainly to answer questions you have about securing your neopets account and the most common ways hackers get access to your account. But I'll answer any questions you have.

I hope this helps some of you.

I'm currently sitting waiting for LoL World All-Stars stream to start (and will be watching it for the next ~6hrs) so I'll be able to answer your questions fairly quickly.

Cheers. :)

Back in 2002, with my wishlist saying: ""can't wait to find out what I'll get on the 25th."" 

Soon, and felt that the prize would be much better than 10k. Other people hoarded theirs also, sharing my sentiments. 

For the rest of the month, nothing appeared in anyone's inventory. People on the boards were furious.. I imagine that on that Christmas day, angry messages were sent to the staff complaining that they received nothing.

 A few days later

No one remembered that I was the one who started this little theory. People were dumping their empty pillow cases into the money tree or trying to sell them for 1 np in the shops. 

I remember the horror I felt; I was responsible for this debacle. I also remember being rather proud that I was responsible for an item's description being changed. I still have 54 empty pillow cases in my safety deposit box as a somber reminder of what I did. 

**TL;DR Ten years ago I started a rumor that cost people a ton of NP and forced TNT to edit an item's description.**

* If you have any extra items to offer up

* If you have a collection you could always use contributions to - big or small - post it! Rainbow dung? post it! Plushies? post it! Random gallery collection? post it!

* If you have a more specific wish

**Some things to remember:**

* It's not always recommended to post your username on here, please feel free to delete or edit the post afterwards! Some are comfortable with their username being posted, some are not. Please use private messaging on reddit to exchange if you are not! :)

* It is recommended that everyone send a couple of neomails back and forth if you're going to gift something big. (even something small!) Random mass gifting or trading can sometimes send TNT a red flag

* If someone pays you a kindness, or you can't do it quite yet, keep the kindness someone has paid you in mind and show someone else the same kindness in the future. :)

* **UPVOTE THIS FOR VISIBILITY!** I get no karma

* If anyone would like to add me, etc to.


**EDIT**: Aw guys this is going really well. :) Keep searching through the posts to see if someone needs what you have, keyquest items, etc. for the next one! Also... add each other! If someone has a plushie gallery and you come across a plushie you don't want, you can gift it to them. It doesn't have to be contained in this thread. :)

I thought I’d put together a mini-guide that introduces the most common ways of making NP, such as this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/yn19y/onestop_reddit_neo_portal/). Also, I’m aware a lot of this is subjective or based on empirical evidence from myself, so if you see something that looks off or have something to add, please share and I'll update the OP!

**Habitarium**

* Profit: 7-8k per hour. No active playing required. Just leave your browser on.
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Requires about 5-10 minutes of maintenance every 6-8 hours to collect gems, etc. You can optimize your profits even more if you have time to check every hour to collect eggs.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Medium learning curve - may take an hour or so to understand how the game works and how to get an optimal set up. Then it’ll take about 2-3 weeks to get your habitarium to level 50. You’ll still make close to 500k during that period leveling up to 50.

**Battledome**

* Profit: ~40k per day via mostly codestones and faeries as prizes. Varies greatly - if you have a pet that can defeat a difficulty 63 challenger (Koi Warrior) and can fight in the Dome of the Deep, your average profits may be a bit lower. You can also get lucky fighting in Pango Palladium (ex. Ghost Lupe) and win PBs worth millions.
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Overall it shouldn’t take anyone more than 15 minutes a day to reach the daily limit of 15 items
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Battling itself is straightforward and takes 5 minutes to learn the basics. In terms of your pet

**KeyQuest**

* Profit: ~20k-100k per day via mostly codestones and neggs as prizes. You play 2 player games where the winner gets a gold key that’ll give you about ~10k in prizes
* Difficulty/Effort: Hard, which will take you about an hour to an hour and a half a day for about ~60k in prizes depending on how good you are.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: It only takes 5 minutes to learn the basics, so it’ll take awhile before you start winning more and more gold keys versus silver keys. Also, you do need a decent machine and connection to succeed in the mini-games. Having a laggy computer or connection will put you at a major disadvantage in winning KQ games.

**Stock Market**

* Profit: ~15k-50k+ a day, and sell when they get higher. If you decide to sell at 30 NP for 15k profit you might be waiting a few weeks, if you decide to sell at 60 NP for 45k profit you might be waiting a few months, etc.
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Takes under a minute each day to find and buy a stock at 15 NP
* Requirements/Learning Curve: There is no strategy at all to the stock market, since you’ll be putting in 15k a day and won’t make any returns probably for a few weeks. 

**Food Club**

* Profit: ~30 times the age of your account in days
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Takes under 5 minutes a day to set up your bets if you follow someone else’s guide (and these are widely available).
* Requirements/Learning Curve: None

**Restocking**

* Profit: Varies. There is no limit to how much you can make by restocking
* Difficulty/Effort: Hard. Restocking takes patience and a lot of constant refreshes
* Requirements/Learning Curve: As mentioned earlier

**Dailies**

* Profit: A few thousand a day on average
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. It should only take you a few minutes a day to run through all your dailies, let me know!
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Varies

**Games**

* Profit: Varies. Each different game is 3k max a day
* Difficulty/Effort: Medium-Hard. Some games like Kass Basher can get you the 3k limit in under a minute
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Varies.",self,t5_2r64t,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/19d9f6/intro_to_popular_ways_of_earning_neopoints/

&gt;You are correct that these words are not filtered because of any bias or discrimination! It makes us sad that anyone would think that
&gt;
&gt;In addition to the dating rules already mentioned, to give you some examples. Unfortunately, we still also have to put sexual orientation and gender identity on this list. Some people are capable of having these discussions in a mature fashion, but there are always people who resort to serious harassment and threats -- two things we definitely do not tolerate and actively attempt to prevent before they start -- and so items on the ""hot topics"" list are not allowed. 
&gt;
&gt;We've had many discussions on this over the years and we revisit the ""hot topics"" often in the hopes that we can remove some of the terms from the list. While that's not possible for the majority of these words right now, explain the reasoning and spirit of the rules to everyone, and ease up on some outdated rules -- is a ways off.** We've been working on it for a while and still have a ways to go. We'll give more info when we're ready!) 
&gt;

&gt;

A bit of background information: I joined Neopets when I was five or six, I never once took a hiatus. 

During those eleven years I never accomplished much. In the beginning

It was pretty much like this up until the conversion came along. (Which I have to say is

One thing I managed to do up until 2011 or so, or freezes of any kind, and I frequented the boards quite often. However, a lot of issues started to occur when TNT introduced the silencing system. 

I'm going to be honest here

Just in my last year and a half of playing I received a total of 12 silences throughout all of my accounts.

There first four I have to say were justifiable, so I kept my nose out of troll boards and posts. Yet one day I made I post on a board telling a knock-knock joke. The joke was hardly inappropriate and in fact, it was this:

""Knock knock. 
Who's there? 
Honey bee. 
Honey bee who? 
Honey bee a dear and get me a soda!""

I received a six day silence for that post. At first I though it was maybe a mistake on the moderators part, ""none of my business, and is completely justified under the Terms and Conditions"".

I was **furious** by this statement. (Now that I think about it, which is probably where I went wrong. 

I literally received two-three day silences for posts such as, similar to a presidential election. (The reason was for discussing politics.)

I decided to quit after this

I'm not saying that TNT was targeting me

Neopets was, I'm happy to hear that there's a new war-based plot out. 

I'm not quite sure why I made this post

On Neopets: 2 of my last 3 KQ keys have had a map piece- one a 60k treasure map, especially since I was just gone for 6 days and couldn't do Food Club. 170k isn't much to most people, especially here, but I just spent all of my money on Nerks and didn't get much, so I now have a bit.

IRL: I got a paid internship that starts next week. I have another job at a small, and still trying to get our names out there. I am moving into a new place for the summer before school starts in the fall, and I'm really excited about the fact that I'll be able to pay for it. I just got back from an AMAZING experience at Bonnaroo (a music festival in TN) with my best friend, her boyfriend and my boyfriend. And my boyfriend and I were kind of rocky since school ended, because he graduated and has a real job he hates, plus band practice twice a week, and he lives about an hour away. So it was nice to not fight and just be together and listen to music. I ALSO have an audition/perhaps a photo shoot tomorrow for a commercial print thing tomorrow. They are trying to get it done pretty soon, so even if I don't get it

This is all coming after a few really bad weeks and months. I have undiagnosed depression (i've had it diagnosed before, and even though these are just some small things, it seems that things are looking up for at least a little. Again, sorry if this isn't okay to post on here, but I have very few friends IRL to talk to.

You should spin it as often as you can (every 40 minutes). You don't want to lose NP? It costs just 100 NP to spin. What if you lose money? You won't. Not in the long run. You want stats to back that up? I have some for you.

In 100 spins, but I have more stats for you. In my 100 spins, do you know how much I made? Take a guess...I made nearly 40,000 NPs if I sold all the items I won. Let that sink in for a minute. 40,000 NPs from spinning a wheel 100 times. That's not luck. That's consistent. That's an average of 400 NPs a spin. This wheel would still be worth spinning if I made *half* of that.

I send this reminder out to guild members sometimes

It's pretty useful to keep a notepad file of your account information, email compromised, etc, and need to prove that your account is actually yours. Most people never take the time to write anything down about their account, and then can't remember when they actually need to know it.

I keep the following for my main

Date I made the list

Account name

Pet names, petpets they have, equipped battledome items, wearables they currently have on.

Bank account type

A sample of items from my SDB. I might list 10-20, or if I have special items, like the Canada only burger king promo items.)

A sample of items in my closet. I collect a lot of NC, Blooming garden, etc. 

If you keep a gallery

I also keep track of the last date I purchased NC, NC trades, the amount of posts you have in your guild, etc.

For Firefox users

Maybe this will get downvoted, but a few of my guild friends have needed theirs. :P",,False,self,t5_2r64t,1366846315.0,maraqua,

A great way to keep people posting is to upvote things that are awesome to the front page, hey, maybe people don't like when I post this. And if people dislike people having pet/item giveaways and such in /r/neopets, that's a great idea for another subreddit if it has enough interest, or another subreddit for advice, if people really dislike having all that stuff here.
