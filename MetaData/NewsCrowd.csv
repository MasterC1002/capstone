&gt;Syria’s access to the Internet was cut on Tuesday. The most likely culprit

&gt;Syrian Internet traffic came to a halt just before 3 p.m. Eastern time. Google reported a drop in Internet traffic around that time

&gt;Four physical cables connect Syria to the Internet — three under the sea, they would have had to physically cut all four cables simultaneously.

&gt;That does not appear to have happened in this case, or B.G.P., routes into Syria in such a way that any information trying to enter the country was not able to find its way.

&gt;“It’s akin to someone removing all the street signs into Syria, an Internet security firm that distributes large volumes of traffic across the Internet. The firm put together a video illustrating Syria’s outage.

&gt;The same technique was used to shut down the Internet and mobile phone service last November. Syrian government officials said terrorists, but evidence pointed to government involvement.

News Conference by Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi

(My own transcription; a bit rough. The translator was a bit tough to follow)

&gt;The Israeli aggressive attack on Syria

&gt;The Syrian government affirmed this link a long time ago. The link between the takfiri ideology and Zionism. The Syrian government has presented evidence about this. This latest attack is more evidence, by all means. Long live Syria... [Indiscernible] 

&gt;We are all in a state of anger. It is not just a single attack. It is practiced daily by the terrorist groups on the ground. When we talk about the connection between Israel and these terrorist groups on the ground

Takfiri is an Islamic term meaning one who has turned against one's own people and religion

&gt;The Lebanese army website listed 16 flights by Israeli warplanes penetrating Lebanon's airspace from Thursday evening through Friday afternoon local time.

&gt;Reuters is reporting that the Syrian National Coalition umbrella opposition group has agreed to admit a liberal bloc in order to broaden its Islamist-dominated ranks.

&gt;Yesterday’s statement from four opposition factions – the Syrian Revolution General Commission, and the Supreme Council for the Leadership of the Syrian Revolution – complained that “the recent attempt to expand membership in the SC is no more than a feeble attempt to add persons and groups that have no real impact on the revolution, and we reject this attempt”. The statement described itself as a “final warning” – presumably of the groups’ intent to leave the umbrella of the SNC. I have contacted the LCCS to ask them if it was liberal groups they objected to and will post their reply when I get it.

&gt;Lebanese Islamic Jihad representative Abu Imad Rifai also stressed to the paper that Hamas remains in Lebanon and that no changes have been made.

&gt;Hamas has denied any support for the Syrian rebels

&gt;Hamas is a Sunni Muslim organization

&gt;Even so, however, Mashaal relocated to Qatar, citing the ongoing conflict in Syria, which is now entering its third year. But the London-based Arabic language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat said at the time that the move was due to Hamas' support for the Syrian opposition. There were also reports at the time that all senior Hamas operatives in Syria had quietly relocated to various other Arab states, including Egypt and Jordan.

&gt;Syria-Lebanon: According to a Beirut newspaper, has distributed a statement announcing that it will commence military operations in Lebanon.

&gt;The statement said, we will harshly respond in the different Lebanese territories, particularly in the border areas, Al-Biqa, and Beirut's Southern Suburb, where the rejectionist members of Hizballah are spreading. We will target markets, schools, and parks.""

&gt;Comment: The term rejectionist is a derogatory description of the Shiites, which is close to the northeastern Lebanon border. Hizballah is fighting in support of the Syrian army forces.

&gt;The significance of the statement is that it means al Qaida could have a franchise operating in Lebanon by next week. The Al-Nusrah Front has the capability to carry out this threat and spread the Syrian fighting deeper into Lebanon.

&gt;BEIRUT — Huge explosions were reported in Damascus early Sunday

&gt;Syrian state media also blamed Israel for Sunday's predawn onslaught

The site targeted was a military research facility in Jamraya, when Israel launched its first known airstrike into Syria since the onset of that nation's civil war.

&gt;Unverified video released early Sunday showed balls of fire soaring into the night sky. Witness accounts from Damascus indicated there was a thunderous explosion about 2 a.m.

&gt;There were no immediate reports of casualties from the reported blasts

&gt;Iran has condemned what it calls a Syrian rebel attack on a shrine where remains of a 7th-century figure revered by Shias were dug up and taken away.

&gt;Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi's comments, posted with photographs on Facebook in late April, highlighted how Syria's civil war was inflaming sectarian anger.

&gt;The report could not be verified but it prompted the Shia leadership in Tehran to urge respect for holy sites in a conflict where the rebels include Sunni Islamists hostile to Iran.

&gt;Salehi urged international organisations to safeguard sacred Islamic and Christian places in Syria

&gt;This is the moment two terrorists who butchered soldier Lee Rigby also tried to kill a hero woman cop who was first on the scene of the carnage.           

&gt;Shocking footage obtained by the Daily Mirror shows how the calculating pair lured officers to the scene by dragging the body into the middle of the road and brazenly waiting for armed police to arrive.

&gt;When the first police car arrived the pair split up in a pre-planned manoeuvre with knife-wielding Michael Adebolajo charging them head-on

&gt;The film of the 10 seconds of terror show how Adebolajo got within TWO FEET of the terrified female cop who was driving the armed response vehicle.

&gt;She was armed with just a Taser as she sat in the driver’s seat of the BMW X5 and was only saved when a male colleague sitting in the back made a split-second decision to fire his machine-gun from point blank range through the window.

&gt;As he is sent sprawling to the ground by the force of the two shots and the two cops jump out to cover him they appear to fail to spot the other suspect aiming his hand gun at them.

&gt;Luckily a third SO19 marksman running round from the far side of the specialist Trojan unit spots him and he is brought to the ground as a further volley of six shots ring out in the suburban street in Woolwich

&gt;Syrian government forces have surrounded the rebel stronghold of Qusair and are storming it from several directions

&gt;Fighting has gone on around the town

&gt;Syrian opposition activists said government air strikes and heavy shelling had killed at least 16 people in the town so far.

&gt;Opposition groups say militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement are fighting alongside government forces.

&gt;There are also reports that hundreds of Lebanese Sunni militants have joined the fight on the rebels' side

&gt;Both sides in the conflict describe fierce hostilities around Qusair

&gt;Activists have reported heavy bombardment since the early morning.

&gt;Our correspondent says the town is of strategic importance for both sides.

&gt;It would give the government command over routes between the capital Damascus and the coast, our correspondent says.

&gt;An Arab League committee on Syria will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday ahead of an international peace conference on ending the country’s civil war

&gt;The foreign ministers of Algeria, Oman, Qatar and Sudan would discuss a U.S.-Russian push for a conference aimed at finding a political solution to the Syria conflict, Ahmed Ben-Hilli told reporters.

&gt;Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would also join the meeting “to follow up on developments in Syria in light of the U.S.-Russian understanding

&gt;The conference is meant to include both rebels and members of the regime -- a difficulty considering some opposition members’ refusal to recognize President Bashar Al-Assad as a negotiating partner.

&gt;Moscow is also calling for the inclusion on this occasion of its trading partner Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia as a counterweight.

&gt;Iraqi forces mounted a massive operation on Saturday to better secure the country’s western desert amid concerns it is being used by Sunnis heading to fight in neighboring Syria.

&gt;Some 20, and looked to secure a key road leading to Syria, top officers said.

&gt;Troops were also moved to the 600-kilometre (375-mile) border with Syria.

&gt;“The operation is large and backed by the air force, told AFP. “It has resulted in the arrest of several Al-Qaeda members and the destruction of some of their strongholds.”

&gt;“The target of the operation is also to clean the desert of the terrorist elements that exist there.”

&gt;Two senior commanders in Al-Qaeda’s local front group

&gt;Majeed did not say how many troops had been sent to the border.

&gt;The operation is being carried out in parts of border provinces Anbar and Nineveh

&gt;Among the mostly-Sunni rebels fighting Assad’s regime are groups allied to Al-Qaeda. That has fuelled fears in Baghdad of a spillover from neighboring Syria increasing tensions and violence in Iraq.

&gt;Warwickshire Police have closed the M6 in both directions between junction two near Coventry and junction four near Coleshill.

&gt;There are huge tailbacks and drivers have been advised to avoid the area and plan alternative routes.

&gt;The Highways Agency said they were made aware of the incident by the police at 3.30pm.

&gt;A spokesman said he understood the vehicle was parked in the car park of the northbound side of Corley services.

&gt;John McDevitt - who saw police clearing people from the area - says the van is parked 50 yards away from a petrol station.

&gt;He described a ""massive police presence and traffic chaos"" as a remote-controlled police vehicle made its way towards the suspicious van.

&gt;In a statement Warwickshire Police said: ""Police are dealing with an incident on the M6 motorway near Corley services.

&gt;Syrian rebels including the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front have counter-attacked east of Damascus to retake a town that served as a conduit for arms from Jordan into the capital before it was seized by government forces last month

&gt;The rebels' struggle to end four decades of Assad family rule has been complicated in part by internal divisions along ideological and political lines

&gt;But in a rare move, have united under one command to wrest back the town of Otaiba, two miles (3 km) northeast of Damascus international airport.

&gt;""This is a huge target no brigade can deliver on its own,"" said a commander whose brigade is one of the 23 taking part in the battle.

&gt;""With God's will this will be a decisive battle in rural Damascus that will stop the advance of the regime army and reopen the supply route.""

&gt;Brigades from the Western-backed rebel General Command and Islamist units joined forces over the weekend and pledged to share weapons and fighters. They took as their flag a white banner with the Muslim declaration of faith: ""There is no god but God; Mohammad is God's prophet""

&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday firmly rejected a Syrian proposal to hold a joint probe over a twin car bomb attack that killed 51 people.

&gt;“The administration in power in Damascus is illegal ... how can we recognize a structure that isn’t even recognized by its own citizens
Syria said earlier Tuesday it was willing to carry out a joint investigation with Turkey into the deadly attacks in the border town of Reyhanli that Ankara has accused Damascus of masterminding.

&gt;“If the government of [Prime Minister Recep Tayyip] Erdogan calls for a joint, in order to find the truth,” Information Minister Omran al-Zohbi had said.

&gt;“The truth must be announced to the Syrian and Turkish people

&gt;Saturday’s twin car bombings also wounded dozens.

&gt;Turkish police have arrested 13 suspects.

&gt;Hizbullah fighters have been advancing swiftly into southern Syria and have reached the flashpoint southern town of Daraa near the border with Jordan

&gt;A source close to Hizbullah told the Kuwaiti al-Qabas newspaper that Hizbullah fighters played a significant role in helping the regime troops to take full power of the strategic town of Kherbet Ghazleh near the highway linking the capital Damascus with Jordan.

&gt;The source pointed out that Hizbullah fighters are not just groups backing the army regime but comprehensive fighting units that includes a full logistic team.

&gt;It said that Hizbullah's military leadership is organizing the transfer of the units and providing them with weapons.

&gt;Britain and France have delayed a Syrian request for Islamist al-Nusra Front to be designated by the United Nations as a terrorist group because they want the militants to instead be listed as an alias of al-Qaida

&gt;The UN Security Council's al Qaida sanctions committee is due to discuss the counter-proposal by Britain and France for listing Nusra later this week

&gt;The issue is procedural as either way Nusra would still be listed on the al Qaida sanctions list and be subject to the same arms embargo

**[AP]**

&gt;A Syrian group that tracks the country's civil war says 23 fighters from the militant group Hezbollah have been killed in fierce clashes in a strategic town near the Lebanese border.

&gt;The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the fighters died in the fighting Sunday around the rebel-held town of Qusair. More than 100 have been wounded.

&gt;Observatory director Rami Abdul-Rahman cited ""sources close to the militant group"" but declined to reveal their identity. The Observatory relies on a wide network of activists in the ground in Syria.

&gt;At least 40 Hezbollah fighters have been reportedly killed in the Syrian town of Qusayr late on Sunday

&gt;Sources also told Al Arabiya that tens of Hezbollah members were wounded during the fight and had been taken to hospitals in Beirut

&gt;The assault on Qusayr appeared to be part of a campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's forces to consolidate their grip on Damascus and secure links between the capital and the government strongholds on the coast via the contested central city of Homs.

&gt;State news agency SANA said the army had ""restored security and stability to most Qusayr neighborhoods"" and was ""chasing the remnants of the terrorists in the northern district"".

&gt;Turkey has shut its side of the last border crossing with Syria still controlled by Syrian President Bashar Assad's government

&gt;Fifty-one people were killed when twin car bombs ripped through the Turkish border town of Reyhanli in the southern province of Hatay on May 11

&gt;Turkey has accused Syria of involvement in the attacks. Damascus has denied any role.

&gt;Customs Minister Hayat Yazici said the Yayladagi gate, during which only Turkish citizens arriving from Syria or non-Syrians transiting through Turkey would be allowed to cross.

&gt;Nobody would be allowed to cross from Turkey into Syria.

&gt;Lebanese supporters of rival factions in Syria's civil war battled overnight in the city of Tripoli in the worst such bout of spillover violence since the conflict started two years ago.

&gt;One person was killed and many were wounded as Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim gunmen fired mortar bombs and rocket-propelled grenades at each other in a fifth day of clashes in the coastal city

&gt;Syrian activists said the fighting in Tripoli was triggered by an assault on the Syrian border town of Qusair

&gt;At least 33 people have been killed and more than 120 wounded in Tripoli since it started

&gt;Tripoli has suffered sporadic sectarian violence since the Suuni-led uprising against President Bashar Assad broke out in February 2012

[CBS] from last night:

&gt;BELCHERTOWN (CBS) – Shortly after midnight Tuesday

&gt;State Police say the five men and two women are from Pakistan, and “cited their education and career interests” for being in the area. The men told police they were chemical engineers and recent college graduates.

The Quabbin

&gt;State Police say there were no warrants or advisories on any of the individuals and “there was no evidence that the seven were committing any crime beyond the trespassing.”

&gt;All seven were allowed to leave and will be summonsed to court for trespassing. The FBI is investigating and routine checks of public water supplies have been increased following the incident.

&gt;The seven individuals currently live in Amherst, Northampton and New York City. Police have not released their names because a court date has not been set.

**From the Worcester Telegram:**

&gt;The FBI and state police are investigating seven people — from Pakistan

&gt;Trooper Adam LeBlanc was on patrol at 12:30 a.m. when he noticed two vehicles parked on Route 9 near the middle entrance to the Quabbin and stopped to investigate. He saw five men and two women, emerging from the woods headed to the vehicles. 

&gt;State police spokesman David Procopio said the “young adults” told police they had stopped to look at the reservoir because it was of interest to them. The men told police they are chemical engineers and had graduated from the nearby University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 

&gt;All seven will be summoned to Eastern Hampshire District Court in Belchertown

&gt;They had addresses in Amherst, Northampton and New York City, police said, adding that their citizenship status was unknown. 

&gt;Because area water supplies are a potential target for terrorism, it holds 412 billion gallons of water. The reservoir comprises 39 square miles and is surrounded by hundreds of acres of forest land. 

&gt;Quabbin Park was closed for some time after the Sept. 11, the park was again closed but reopened the following day. 

&gt;After finding the alleged trespassers

&gt;“There were no red flags, “Police did not find any evidence to suspect terrorism or a crime beyond trespassing, but the late hour, the curious explanation for their interest in the reservoir, and the fact that they were inside a restricted area marked as such clearly warrants a closer look and further investigation.” 

&gt;The FBI was alerted

&gt;State police said the investigation is ongoing.

**From Boston.com:**

&gt;State Police and FBI agents are investigating seven college-aged individuals from foreign countries who were allegedly trespassing at the Quabbin Reservoir in Ware just after midnight Tuesday morning, told authorities that they were recent graduates from the University of Massachusetts and Smith College and were at the reservoir for education and career interests, State Police said. The men said they were chemical engineers. A preliminary investigation found the individuals are from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore, but State Police said there are no warrants out for them. All seven were charged with trespassing.

****

* **The Mirror** 

&gt;The FBI was last night hunting a 12-strong terrorist “sleeper cell” linked to the Boston marathon bomb brothers.

&gt;Police believe Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were specially trained to carry out the devastating attack.

&gt;More than 1

&gt;A source close to the investigation said: “We have no doubt the brothers were not acting alone. The devices used to detonate the two bombs were highly sophisticated and not the kind of thing people learn from Google.

&gt;“They were too advanced. Someone gave the brothers the skills and it is now our job to find out just who they were. Agents think the sleeper cell has up to a dozen members and has been waiting several years for their day to come.”

&gt;A specialist team of CIA and FBI interrogators was yesterday flown to a Boston hospital to grill wounded Dzhokhar

**[Al-Arabiya]**

&gt;Lebanese supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar Assad fired heavy machine guns and lobbed mortar shells at each other Thursday in some of the worst fighting in the port city of Tripoli in years.

&gt;The battles raised the five-day death toll to 16 and fed fears of the Syrian civil war spreading to Lebanon and other neighboring countries.

&gt;Lebanon has been on edge since the uprising in Syria began in March 2011. The country

&gt;Deadly sectarian street fighting has erupted on several occasions

&gt;Tripoli is overwhelmingly Sunni but has a tiny community of Alawites

&gt;Residents reported more than six hours of fighting that began late Wednesday and continued through Thursday morning. Mortar shells were used for the first time. Ambulances rushed back and forth

&gt;Five people were killed, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations.

**[Al-Arabiya]**

&gt;Turkey is constructing2.5-km-long (1.5 mile) twin walls at a border crossing with Syria to increase security at the frontier following three deadly bombings this year.

&gt;The concrete walls will be built on either side of the road leading from the Turkish side of the crossing at Cilvegozu tothe Syrian border gate and will be topped with barbed wire

&gt;Cilvegozu was the scene of a bombing in February which killed 14 people and this month 51 people died when twin car bombs ripped through the nearby town of Reyhanli.

&gt;Since July

&gt;Approved Turkish vehicles are currently allowed into the unoccupied buffer area between the Turkish and Syrian gates to unload goods before turning back.

&gt;The Bab al-Hawa gate on the Syrian side fell under the control of rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year. February's bomb struck inside the buffer area very close to the Turkish gate.

&gt;Vehicle screening equipment and x-ray machines as well as wire fencing and extra lighting and security cameras will also be installed

&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan will visit Reyhanli on Saturday

**[France 24]**

&gt;The regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad has agreed ""in principle"" to attend international talks on the crisis planned for June in Geneva

&gt;Syria's most powerful ally Russia said Friday that the Damascus regime had agreed ""in principle"" to attend an international peace conference on the crisis that world powers hope will take place in Geneva in June.

&gt;But Moscow also criticised Syria's various opposition groups for presenting tough demands that in some cases included the exclusion of President Bashar al-Assad's representatives from the negotiations.

&gt;Russian foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Russia had received the Damascus government's agreement to take part in the Geneva conference during a visit to Moscow by Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Muqdad.

&gt;""We note with satisfaction that we have received an agreement in principle from Damascus to attend the international conference in the interest of the Syrians themselves finding a political path to resolve the conflict

The head of the Associated Press’s news-gathering operations said Tuesday that she was “distressed” by the Justice Department snooping on the phone records of 100 journalists and added that in decades in the business she’s never seen anything like it.

Between the Live Update threads in the new,  something amazing and unprecedented was happening. Revolutionary even. Reddit way way ahead on the story in Watertown.

We want to reach out to the community and get your input.

1. **What did reddit do right?**

2. We should try and identify 'best practices'. 

3. If we were to begin to compile an open database of news sources

4. Can we be prepared to cover major news evens even faster than last time? What can we do to prepare for the next big story?





5. **What did reddit do wrong?**

6. Obviously posting the details of officer movements needs to be kept to a minimum during some situations. What else can we do to ensure that we are not damaging active investigations

7. I think we are all aware of the situation with the fellow who I will not name here out of respect. We definitely want to avoid trying to tie online profiles to FBI pictures in full public view. If you see something, we should definitely consider our options. 

9. How interested are users here in a news subreddit that delivers **all of the information**, and a lot of critical thinking from reddit. I saw something glorious. Do you think we can do this again?

10. Do you have any other thoughts to share about crowd-sourcing news coverage? I wish I had more thoughtful and insightful comments to make. I guess I will just reiterate how much amazed I was by some of the incredible reporting I was seeing by redditors. Crowd-sourced news is the future. But that's just like,,False,,t5_2x02z,False,,True

3. Keep all discussions civilized. 

4. Personal attacks will not be tolerated. Unnecessarily vulgar language is strongly discouraged, pop-culture references, and jokes are not permitted.

&gt;At Wednesday's daily briefing

&gt;""I would say that one of the options is reappointing a senior official at the State Department to renew our focus on repatriating or transferring those detainees
""We're in the process of working on that now; we're looking at candidates"" who could lead the process of helping close Guantanamo

&gt;""The president has indicated that it's too expensive, and so we're going to make a renewed effort to close Guantanamo.""

&gt;But with more than half the facility's inmates engaging in various forms of hunger strike

&gt;There are 86 inmates at Guantanamo who have been cleared for transfer

**[15:20 EST]**

**[Reuters]**

&gt;Obama was to say that the United States will only use drone strikes when a threat is imminent

&gt;Under a new presidential guidance signed recently

&gt;And any drone strike will only be launched when a terrorism suspect cannot be captured. The United States will respect state sovereignty and will limit strikes to al Qaeda or associated targets

&gt;""Importantly before any strike is taken

&gt;The use by the United States of armed drone aircraft to attack extremists has increased tensions with countries such as Pakistan and drawn criticism from human rights activists. He said earlier this year he wanted to be more open about the issue.

**[15:24 GMT/UTC]**

&gt;Spokane Police are in Browne's Addition Saturday morning conducting operations in conjunction with the investigation into two letters that preliminarily tested positive for Ricin found at the Spokane Post Office earlier this week.

&gt;The law enforcement action is happening at 1st and Oak in Browne's Addition

&gt;Two letters arrived at the post office earlier this week that tested positive for Ricin

&gt;The FBI confirmed earlier this week it was assisting in the investigation; its not known yet if it was participating in the law enforcement action in Browne's Addition.

&gt;A Washington National Guard unit, was deployed to Spokane after the discovery of the letters to also aid in identifying whether or not Ricin was found in those letters.

&gt;A news release posted to the American Postal Workers Union website earlier this week said two letters addressed to the Spokane Post Office and a federal judge were postmarked May 13 and arrived at the post office on May 14. Both preliminarily tested positive for Ricin.

&gt;The APWU website report stated ""they have no reason to believe that any employees are at risk from handling the suspect letters as they passed through the mailstream in Spokane.""
