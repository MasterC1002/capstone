It stuck me so much that I had to transcribe it and share.

*Context: they are discussing a religious pamphlet that was distributed with this line:*

&gt;""Carl Sagan would want you to read this."" As if he's our prophet - that's how they think.  That's why when they go after evolution they're going after Darwin, they do it quote by quote, not study by study or evidence by evidence but quote by quote. That's how they think, that's how they build their case: it's all quotes and authority from the Bible and based upon the authority and rightiousness of whatever from their prophets. It's funny that they reveal how they think when they engage with us, they use their own tactics, as if that's going to be pursuasive to us. and then when we counter that, it's like we're talking past each other

&gt;     It shouldn't be any simpler than this. If they want it for us
&gt;   HR 615
&gt;   On Tuesday
&gt;
&gt;   Congressman John Fleming has proposed an amendment that would require Congressmen and Senators to take the same health care plan that they would force on us. (Under proposed legislation  are exempt.)
&gt;   Congressman Fleming is encouraging people to go to his Website and sign his petition.  The process is very simple
&gt;
&gt;Senator Coburn and Congressman Fleming are both physicians.  Regardless of your political beliefs
&gt;
&gt;Please urge as many people as you can to do the same!

my reply:
&gt;The public option is just that
&gt;
&gt;Please cease disseminating false information.
&gt;
&gt;Regards

&gt;Please send an apology to me and copy all my friends and sign it
&gt; 
&gt;You can request no emails sent to you from me. You do not have the right to tell me what to do
&gt; 
&gt;You do not know everything contrary to what you seem to think. The public option will likely put other plans out of business.  You would do well to demonstrate an ounce of respect for your elders. Respect is a basic and will take you far. Disrespect will take you down a very sad road.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;Aunt Victoria

I have not replied to

here is an email i received from a distant relative regarding my reply:
&gt;Richard
&gt;My mom forwarded your response to me.
&gt;Thank you for your efforts to educate people
&gt;
&gt;See you on the 19th at the family Christmas party
&gt;Greg XXXXX

It would seem that my reply has been circulating around my extended family

I felt his thank you warranted a thank you in return.
&gt;Greg
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your reply, correcting them in front of their peers. The vitriol i received after sending that message was intense to say the least. However what concerned me more than anything was the demand for an apology; one to be sent not only the sender but to each recipient of my reply as well.
&gt;
&gt;An apology infers that a morally reprehensible act has taken place, the implications of this demand are, in fact, what should be deemed morally reprehensible.
&gt;
&gt;It is my opinion that facts matter more than feelings; that discovering, when necessary, perhaps make others uncomfortable in order to convey the importance of truth.
&gt;
&gt;Truth is derived from reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality.""  I shiver when I attempt to understand the thought process behind the sort of cognitive dissonance required for the act of observing what is true, yet convincing yourself of something else. I am certain that people who intently and unabashedly spread, or encourage the spread of untruth are the most culpable when the consequences of evading reality eventually come to bear. I am also certain that utilizing deception to advance an agenda is contemptible. The more systematic and purposeful the deception, the more contemptible are the perpetrators.
&gt;
&gt;Truth and the reality it stems from are the axioms of my existence and will not pause when it becomes necessary to correct someone attempting to spread information that contradicts these; moreover I remain unapologetic for doing so.
&gt;
&gt;See you on the 19th indeed.
&gt;
&gt;Richard Wright

It feels good to know that there are others in my family willing to take a stand for honesty and truth. Until now i thought i was the only one who was willing to confront/debate members of my family who spew nonsensical opinions or present lies as truth. 

Hopefully this will result in a change in the family dynamic and open the door for more discussion and debate leading to critical thinking.


**TL;DR my aunt is nuts and has apparently never been confronted for her nonsense publicly. I embarrassed her in front of her target audience and she was SUPER PISSED. Then members of my family secretly thanked me.**

I'm framing this in what is probably a false dichotomy, sometimes hourly. Is there a benefit from experiencing life from both extreme angles, or should somebody like me really try to focus on one or the other? (Cut the losses and choose to be either a nice, empathetic person who risks getting royally f'd over, or adopt a 'balls-to-the-walls' attitude that works his ass off and takes no prisoners.)

I'm guessing the answer is ""Depends on what you want to accomplish"" or ""It's better to manipulate yourself into optimism than become depressed and kill yourself"".

1333038221.0,rjetr,Thoughts on gender ,blueseashell3,113,33,125,"edit: tl;dr and final edit at bottom should sum it up nicely for you.

So after a lot of thinking and reading lately on sexism in the US (and a little while of beginning to feel a little like all men are misogynistic; thanks to republican candidates and response articles), without realizing how sexist it is until I stop and think.

I'm a female going into engineering and often sit in a classroom with at most 5 other women. Many would say that is because women just aren't as interested in engineering/science/math. But this is not necessarily true. We are encouraged as kids to go into a different set of professions then men. By everyone. So for many

I am so glad that the men in my life (and women) encourage me to do well in a career usually thought of as masculine

There are studies everywhere that show both genders think and problem solve very differently, that's a woman's/man's job, a man/woman won't on average do as well in it."" Not true. Just what we've been programmed to think. 

We see each other as walking people, our interests and skills are blurred across those areas that supposedly should have dividing lines of gender. hmmm.... 

But I definitely feel better now because I know the men in my life don't look down on me like it was beginning to feel they might.

One man in my life said straight up men are innately better at math and science than women



Tl;dr I was starting to think all guys were sexist pigs and started to hate them a bit. Did some thinking and research and realized guys aren't sexist. We all are because we grow up being taught sexist norms and so think that they must be true. Like men again now.

Edit: some grammar.

Edit2: someone pointed out it sounded like I am saying this is the republicans' fault. Totally not what I meant. I meant that the current remarks and initiatives of many republicans sparked this current train of thought.

Edit 3: Thanks so much for all this discussion. So many good points brought up. And thanks to all the guys who say that girls that they know are just as good in their technical courses. It helps bolster my belief that the sexism (or gaps between men and women) is
One thing that makes me sad is all these arguments about how women *are* not as good as men at stuff. It feels to me that some people are saying, I was hopeful that the cultural habit of gender stereotyping would go away. Now I worry it won't. 
I think it would be much better if we didn't decide an individual's worth based on the studies and statistics. I want to be able to scrap the whole gender discussion and just go



FINAL EDIT: All of the discussion has really helped me refine my thoughts on this and where I stand in gender issues. Thanks to WillToHave and the studies they showed me I see that there are differences although not (apparently) in the way many people claim. But seeing these things made me feel that while there are these differences people should be allowed and encouraged as individuals to do whatever they want, without outside people forcing them into any direction or role. The numbers seem to be a lot of people's excuse to maintain the status quo, but that limits everyone. So conclusion: that studies are interesting side notes but shouldn't make an impact on how you judge an individual.

1346011322.0,yv6r7,Just wanted to extend a friendly invite to everyone here welcoming you to join us over at the new Recovering From Religion subreddit!,OuRR_World,107,36,13,"Hi everyone!

Jerry and I did an AMA a few months ago, as well as exploring the impact of religion in your life. Where it differs from similar other ""former religion"" subreddits is that this is an overarching ""recovering"" type concept, as opposed to a more denominational/specific focus. The trends and processes of leaving religion are similar across the board, so while there's no doubt a specific focus is helpful as well in finding a common ground of people leaving a specific religion, it's also tremendously valuable to connect with people all over the spectrum who are going through similar challenges personally, and with family and friends.

We do know it's Reddit and there are entire colonies of delightfully argumentative /r/'s to go play in, and decorum in ours...we know it can be done! Also, take a few minutes to check out our website (www.recoveringfromreligion.org), our Facebook fb/recoveringfromreligion, and our Twitter (@Ourr_World) to find a local group near you, learn more about us, what we do, and where we are headed from here. For even more information

Thanks for taking the time to read about us, so bear with us as we figure it all out together. Hope to see you over there, and feel free to ask if you have questions or need more information.

All the best!
~Sarah
