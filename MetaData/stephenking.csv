It was my impression reading this the first time in high school that they had been chosen by God to survive the plague

But now it seems completely clear. All of the characters we see begin by relating (internally) that they had always had a lot of dreams from a young age. We know of course that Abagail Freemantle and Nick Andros are especially gifted with what Abagail calls ""the shining lamp of God"". But at one point Larry notes that the people in Boulder all seem to stop and stare off into space from time to time

So, and is what allows Abagail Freemantle and Randall Flagg (both incredibly strong in the shining/touch) to act as ""beacons"" to draw the survivors to them.",,False,,t5_2rce8,False,,

*Offended, he knew that, and they had accepted him as one of them, but they would still laugh. All the same, there were things that were not supposed to be. They offended any sane person’s sense of order, they offended the central idea that God had given the earth a final tilt on its axis so that twilight would only last about twelve minutes at the equator and linger for an hour or more up where the Eskimos built their ice-cube houses, that He had done that and He then had said, if you can figure out the tilt, the lights in the sky are stars, Stan would have said if he could. Maybe not forever

It ended up being more like a ""Inside the actor's studio"" setup where there was a small stage with 2 chairs set up. The head of the  English Department (who happened to be a friend  of King's) was the one interviewing him and thus the audience was able to witness an in-person interview with Stephen King. 

Questions asked during the formal interview included a lot of typical stuff revolving around his book ""On Writing"" referencing how he got started and where his ideas come from (the standard stuff). He then went on to tell some anecdotes which I am sure some of you already know about where the idea for Cujo came about and how he came up with the idea for The Stand. These were awesome to hear in person

Next King read a previously unpublished

Lastly

Unfortunately


There were some good ones

*Women:* ""I have already been to a couple of your Q&amp;A's before and I remember you saying that you don't like cellphones because you think they are evil-

*Stephen King:* ""I didn't say that""

*Women:* ""well that you don't like them. You also said that you don't carry one for that reason...so...I guess I'd like to ask

*Stephen King:* ""Yes.""


That was it. That was the final question. She cut people off and sneaked into line in order to ask a question to which she already knew the answer to. A question which held no purpose or relevance to anything mind you. Who gives a shit if the man owns a cellphone?! Who cares? Do you think he would give you his number?

It seems to me the series, and King is the gunslinger.

In the first book, but ultimately dropping most of them and keeping them as a distant memory. This violent process of creating and killing is signified by him killing all of Tull after developing some characters (namely Allie). Also, he is chased out of the town by a witch who essentially makes the whole town turn on him, just as the story would turn on him if he spent more time on these minute characters in this small town. In other words, he knows he needs to think bigger, and he can't expand the story in the tiny town of Tull. I guess in this case Allie's warning to never say Nort's trigger word could be a sort of warning to keep the end of the story in the back of his mind, but to not solidify it at the expense of the story. Like death, but our mortality (the end of the story for King) should always be kept in the backs of our minds. 

Next, and to the story- he propels it forward and injects heart into it. Roland/King knows from the beginning that in order to propel the story into a larger concept; a touching story of the cold-hearted Roland thawing because of a young, naive boy isn't enough. This is emphasized right before Jake dies and says ""there are other worlds than these;"" meaning you can't just focus on me. Furthermore, the man in black signifies his driving force, even if at times he is hesitant to do what is right for the story, as it seems cruel or radical, King still listens to the driving force.

Then King moves on to his second phase in the Drawing of the Three, but he comes to terms with it and is able to embody them and steer them as he needs, oftentimes using their back-story  and the knowledge the character has as a way to stay true to the character. 

Ultimately, he feels like an addict, always only thinking about writing instead of living in the moment. It can be torture feeling so consumed by his craft, but when he gets his fix, or in other words makes great progress or has a realization for the story, it is equivalent to Eddie shooting up and feeling euphoric. O/detta's kleptomania represents his desire to steal ideas from other authors, even though they would end up looking cheap and vulgar in his own writing. She also represents the challenge of not turning characters into caricatures. Detta is a racist caricature of an African-American woman, and King knows that if the two can look at each other, Jack Mort represents how King may vicariously live through his characters to fulfill some deep desires he would never act on. King feels that acting on these desires is sick in a way

King sees the whole process of writing as not only self-indulgent

Finally, being a writer requires endless observation of society and looking at the world objectively. Such a lifestyle can cause disillusionment with the world, and a sense of futility regarding human nature.  

Roland and King are one

Anyway, who is on the 7th book, says it makes a lot of sense. Thoughts??

TL;DR the Dark Tower series is a metaphor for King's writing process/struggles. Also Roland = King

I've always imagined *IT* as a pretty straight forward horror tale for whatever reason, crazy, gory deaths of children with an almost filthy atmosphere and while that's in there(I'm looking at you preteen gangbang in the sewers) -it's overshadowed by such a sweet nostalgia of love and friendship. I'd be hesitant to say the novel is even about a murderous clown.

So, where exactly does Dandelo fit in? Is he/she just another version of It, but for that universe/dimension? This is where I'm kind of lost. It gets pretty psychadelic.

I've noticed that some of his more recent books have been piling on a sense of dread and depression in them that makes me squirm while reading them.  Under the Dome as an example did a good job of slowing putting the town under the control of Remy while Dale's small team of heros is put under more and more pressure to save the town from itself and the dome. 

I'm reading 11/22/63 right now and it has the same feeling of impending doom for George/Jake in that the obdurate past is going to come crashing down on him.  He keeps placing these bets and I know he is going to get in trouble for them eventually with the mob.  I am reading this knowing that he is going to be ruined by his actions and he isn't doing anything to stop it.  I feel like King has been reading and building off of how Cormac McCarthy writes and I mean that in a good way.

Tommyknockers is another depressing one that is a little tougher to read but still really good.

All of the Richard Bachman stuff has this giant sense of doom and dread over everything. 

Are there any other good King books that are just depressing and feeling like everything is leading towards inevitable doom that I could be missing?

I tend to get the feeling From a Buick 8 is generally a ""meh"" for SK readers. I just would like to attempt to vouch for the story, the strange comfort of what you can't ever understand? Why must I be the one to suffer? The character development is phenomenal, there is a lot of reading in between the lines you should try your hardest to do (always read between the lines!). Think of Hearts in Atlantis, which I found similar in overall feeling. It's not overtly action packed, so if that's going to be a big problem, try another story; but I'd also like you to question yourself as a reader if that's your top priority.

I don't know Stephen King. Obviously. If I did

Putting aside the obvious thing (that King's body of work gradually forms itself into one epic, hundreds of characters and stories into one single epic), King manages to put so much of himself into them as to make it into a crazy autobiography. Not just through the stories themselves, made up of major parts of King's life (the ongoing motifs of writers, Maine, battles with addiction/alcoholism, and the ultimate triumph of love, but through the innumerable Introductions and Author's Notes

On Writing, but you still come away from it with a deeper sense of who King is than you do with many genuine autobiographies, perhaps mainly due to his emotion and frustation at the accident that had such an impact on him. This too is entwined with his work, crippling/fatal accidents and crashes playing a major part in the works following his accident (Dreamcatcher, From A Buick 8).

Then... fuck. Then, all of his characters and all of his stories: 'to a greater or lesser degree, every story I have ever written has been about this story'. For a brief moment, it seems like things are going to get a bit meta-wanky; Roland and Eddie seek out an author named Stephen King, wondering if he is their God.

But... but *fuck*. At the end of the book, it lays out his entire writing career, covering the myriad real-life inspirations for the books we've read, detailing his battle with addiction and alcoholism, his desperation to win, the ultimate victory of the love of his family and the success of his children.

And then he kills himself in the goddamn fucking crash.

And you don't know Stephen King, and what ultimately makes him who he is.

And then he *fucking kills himself in the crash*. And that's him, and all that he is. To the point that, despite not appearing as a character until Song of Susannah, his fate is so well-established through his previous work as to make it the most meaningful and tragic thing that could possibly have happened.

Christ, because I need to put it *somewhere*, and then I'm going to go away forever and comfort eat.",,False,,t5_2rce8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/1dyxjl/song_of_susannah_and_reading_king_in_order_or_why/

[SPOILERS FOR DREAMCATCHER BELOW]






The first half was actually pretty good, which I feel was one of the most interesting parts of the story. 



There was not nearly enough character development, the faces he made, his ability to transform into an ""adult byrum"", and the completely got rid of the idea of him slowly becoming more human. 



The worst of all was the ending




All in all they completely ruined what was actually a pretty decent book. There has been other movies that were no where near as good as the book

**The Good**

Gary Sinise as Stu Redman.  Period.  If Sinise wasn't so good as Stu, and he pulls together a lot of weak points (the crew of doctors in the various hospitals during the flu were not particularly talented).

The cameos and bit players.  Ed Harris as Starkey.  Kathy Bates as Ray Flowers.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Ken Jenkins as Frannie's dad.  I'll even go so far as to say Ossie Davis as The Judge (although his death scene wasn't the best).  Whenever one of these guys popped up

Other good casting:  Roy Walston, Bill Fagerbakke and Matt Frewer.

The crucifixion scenes looked as real as I would like to see.  Also

""Baby Can You Dig Your Man""

Tasteful omissions:  I never really liked The Kid's story line

**The Bad**

Casting-wise:  Jamey Sheridan was OK, but I don't know if a better actress would have pulled off that debacle.  I already mentioned the doctors, also the people from Arnette.  

Frannie should have told her dad she was pregnant

Ugh, so maybe this isn't a complete negative.

Nick's reaction to finding the bomb in the closet.  Dear God.  Rob Lowe was not particularly well suited to this role.

The delayed reaction shots when Stu kills Dietz.

Glen Bateman getting quite heavy-handed with the religion on Lloyd after he gets shot.

**The Ugly**

The Hand of God.  If you watch the DVD commentary

The Rat Man.

Stu's fall when he broke his leg.

The Hand of God.  It deserves to be mentioned at least twice.

And as much as I love his characters, I've not been a huge fan of his longer novels

Anyway, some of which are bigger than the book itself. I do love the book, because it's a great story, a nice exciting one, which is also pretty tragic. Has some of King's best characters so far, in Ralph and Lois and McGovern, which also leads to there being a lot of really nice stuff about getting old, and his getting involved in the major events going on just to do what was right

But also it's amazing as part of the ongoing writing of King, plus the endless references to different books, and characters bumping into main characters from previous books, but *Insomnia* is the first one that's pulled it all together and made it feel like a huge universe, using the Dark Tower to gather everything together.

I know i know. Sadie went on to do great things. Jake was happy she didn't die. But the fact that we experienced her life, so technically that string wasn't a complete waste. That it did have somewhat of an impact on them. But goddamnit, it was just so depressing to me.

The other girls would pelt her with sanitary napkins when she got her period. The period would release the right hormones and she would rain down destruction on them… I did the shower scene, but I hated it and threw it away.

Of course, not to mention the whole thing about the universe destroying itself. BUT perhaps Jake would have reset time regardless of the future in order to save Sadie. In a forced way, making Sadie the cause of Kennedy not being saved, and therefore being killed.

Jack seeks the Talisman as a way to heal his mother's cancer and, which sounds EXACTLY like the Tower. It IS the Tower. Reading Jack's trip across the US/The Territories is like reading a mini version of Roland's journey.

Questions: Are the Tower and the Talisman one and the same

Can we see Jack's success as a conclusion to the cyclic nature of Roland's quest? I feel like I get some closure that The Dark Tower doesn't really provide. 

Also, I don't get a sense of how much he and his writing style contributes to the text. There's a VERY VERY VERY clear and constant sense of King, though. (I was especially struck by the series of events when Jack actually gets the Talisman, basically retribution and righteousness for marginal characters, that is so much like the end of IT.)

He walked straight down to the BPW garage and punched his clock and went down to Wally's Spa and started drinking. It killed him two years later. Frankie said he tried to talk to him about it and George said something one time, and that was when he was pretty well blotto. Turned around on his stool, George did, an' asked Frankie Haldeman if he'd ever seen a spider as big as a good-sized dog setting in a web full of kitties an' such all wrapped up in silk thread.

Now, but I know now that I should have started with something more well-known and exciting. With that said, I still caught the Stephen King bug. I made my way to my downtown bookstore and stumbled across a hardcover copy of IT. After a little research, I think I own a first edition, first print copy of this book. I can't wait to get started. I have seven days before classes start, which gives my a two-hundred-pages-per-day pace. This is completely doable.

Is there any value to a first edition copy of IT? I paid $9.98 for it at the bookstore and some websites value this book at $99 others say it's only worth $15.00. What gives? Should I keep this book safely tucked away on my bookshelf and pick up a paperback copy just to be safe? Any thoughts?

Having only skipped Roadwork and The Talisman (both of which I will come back to), I'm up to Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes, and well... meh. I've not been the biggest fan of his short stories, his short stories feel like he's trying to stuff the same amount of story into a much smaller space. It's not been so bad with his other collections, it's starting to niggle that all of the stories in here feel like the horror is just *completely* buried by normality and normal life (which is how I feel about a lot of his books

So far my favourite stories fro this book have been Popsy (guy kidnaps a child who has a friend looking for him) and You Know They Got A Hell Of A Band (couple end up lost in a town with people who look like rockstars), and is really mysterious and intriuging, ending on a creepy note that just makes you realize what's going on. You Know They Got A Hell Of A Band, after a really overlong start which sets up a load of stuff which is irrelevant to the rest of the story (I feel like, as strong as his character stuff is, it way undermines the horror stuff - this story could be much more effective without the marriage stuff, and it has no real relevance to the story so it's not really needed), over-explaining something that's already fairly clear but could have been more memorable if left on an earlier line - without the waitress explaining it all and then the main character reinforcing it in her head. Most of the other stories in the book so far I think put in so much characterization and backstory that the horror aspect, The Finger creeped the shit out of me

For me? Well


My project would be a video game adaptation of The Stand

1. ""THE JOURNEY"" The first part would have the player taking control of one of the groups traveling to Hartford Home/Boulder early on in the story. This would play out a bit like The Oregon Trail

2. ""THE RECONSTRUCTION OF BOULDER"" The game would switch to a more Sim City-ish type of gameplay. In it, The Player would also have to arrange spy missions to Las Vegas and attempt to establish contact with other civilizations.

3. ""MISSION TO VEGAS"" In this mode

4. ""THE HAND OF GOD""  the game would switch over to gameplay like that of a Adventure Game. [This would mainly just be pissing Flagg off in jail and stalling until the Trashcan Man arrives with the bomb.] (/spoiler) Perhaps the player could manage a jailbreak and flee before the bomb goes off?

5. ""BOULDER FOREVER"" -- This would be a mode unlocked upon beating the game: The player would continue to either keep tending to Boulder or start a new civilization. In boulder

I'd like the ability for the player to have the ability to change certain plot events (such as the ability to talk down Harold from going berserk by making the right actions/dialogue choices),,False,,t5_2rce8,False,,True

1374726237.0,1j0a1p,Opinions on a reboot of The Stand [The Stand spoilers],thefrenchhornguy,7,1,6,"Those of us familiar with The Stand no doubt know of the TV miniseries adaptation that aired in 1994. Personally

By most account the miniseries was decent. Gary Sinise as Stu Redman, as is the case with many a TV or film adaptation, much was left out. I'm not the type of person to complain about that sort of thing. The endless ranting and raving of Harry Potter fans about film omissions and people who still just can't get over the fact that Tom Bombadil wasn't in The Lord of the Rings movies bore me to tears. I understand that cuts must be made, certain things don't translate easily or well from the page to the screen, budgets, time constraints, all that. TV and movies are not books. I say that so that my next statement won't come across as that of one more fan whining about what was left out of the original Stand miniseries. 

As a Stephen King fan, I think a reboot of The Stand as an HBO miniseries would be excellent, quite frankly, a lot of fun. There are a couple of things I think HBO could bring to a reboot that would adapt The Stand as it deserves:

- A bigger budget. Sure, but it is also an epic that involves dozens of characters traipsing across these United States in the wake of a plague that nearly wipes out humanity. A budget to support the scale of the narrative and truly show events as we imagine them unfolding would go a long way to telling the story well. HBO could deliver on that.
- No content filter. *The Stand* is dirty, it's part of the story. HBO has license to push envelope here where other networks do not since it is a cable network.
- More airtime. A season of HBO runs about 10 episodes. The original miniseries was six hours. If you adapted *The Stand* in one season on HBO you'd get four more hours to develop story

Those are my three main points. There are dozens of subpoints and little things that I think would make an HBO reboot of *The Stand* a great thing. But I want to know how you feel, or not at all? Who would you like to see cast as who if they aired it next year? If you've seen the original miniseries, what did they leave out that you would've really liked to see?

But after awhile, without any real payoff or meaning. 


It was like King couldn't/didn't want to create suspense from the idea of changing history, then write ""The past is obdurate"" and that would explain it.


I was fine with this through most of the book

And again: **SPOILERS!**

With that out of the way, but only finished yesterday.

My main problem was that **I don't like the structure of this book**. A tale inside of a flashback? I liked DT4, it glued my eyes to the pages - and there was another factor: the main story progressed just enough (Blaine the Mono, how could I forget thee?) and so brilliantly that I did not mind the flashback at all.

In TWTTK however, I desperately wanted ""out"", wanted to get one narrative layer up, wanted the skin-man story to progress. Reading the skin-man story, I wanted the main story to progress. And oh, another important fact: **there is no main story to speak of.**

You could argue the same about DT4 (Blaine aside), a narrative frame, an excuse, if you will to tell a flashback - whereas in DT4, the Blaine thing was a natural progression of the story, and the stuff at the end of the book was also fitting. It was not much, but what was, the main storyline does not add much to the saga

Which brings me to the skin-man story. It had interesting elements, the book is a decent read. But this is the problem: decent. Not interesting, not intriguing, just... decent. For this reason, I struggled for months finishing it, because nothing pulled me back to it.

The overall conclusion of Roland's story is a worthy addition to the saga

**Parts I liked:**

- Tim in the swamp
- Tim and the Tyger
- The conclusion of Tim's story
- The way the second half of the skin-man story was written
- The overall conclusion of the book

**Parts I did not like:**

- The beginning of each story. The exposition parts were really boring. Even though I like such stuff in other DT (and King) books
- The ""identity"" of the skin-man. The solution was too starightforward with the white scar and all
- Not enough new information is provided in the book in general. The book was too verbose and content was scarce.
- It is not well written enough! DT4 blows this out of the water

BUT. Is it possible that Cogan, and it also seems that he is somehow aware that he will be left without ID, hence the cigarettes. 

I checked out The Colorado Kid's Wikipedia site

&gt;The review of The Colorado Kid in today’s issue of today's USA Today mentions that there was no Starbucks in Denver in 1980. Don’t assume that’s a mistake on my part. The constant readers of the Dark Tower series may realize that is not necessarily a continuity error

Any thoughts on this? It's a little mindblowing in its possibilities...

Prior to this point in the story, would be shown to be more alone in the world. Perhaps when Al dies, our protagonist Jake looks up at Al’s bedroom walls and notices that Al has no recent pictures of himself with any close friends or partners. Al reached out to Jake (somewhat of a stranger), because he had no one else to reach out to. 

*  *  *  *
As Jake and Sadie begin to climb the stairs of the Texas Book Depository, ya’ll ain’t allowed in ‘ere!” 



Sadie urges Jake onward, working her womanly charms to persuade him to give up his chase. 
Jake arrives on the 6th floor, and Kennedy is alive” Jake thinks to himself, as the gravity of the situation settles in. Never before in the course of human history – anyone’s history, has that statement been true. 



Moments later, gun in hand. 


Behind them


The uniform men turn, confused and in a futile attempt to save Sadie, Jake lifts his gun and opens fire on the two officers, hitting one in the head and striking the other in the arm. The officer with the arm wound steps back into the elevator and quickly closes the door. 

Jake runs to Sadie, feeling as though he’s achieved his greatest goal and sacrificed his only love, Jake holds Sadie’s body and promises that he will bring her back. Jake looks over at the dead police officer and without hesitating, strips the man of his uniform, dresses himself in the pants and shirt, and begins to head towards the stairs. 

Looking down the staircase, shoots himself across the skin of his forearm, causing significant bleeding, but what he hopes is only a minor wound. 

Jake begins to descend the stairs, hiding behind the boxes. The officers run by him, guns drawn. 
It seems the past is no longer so obdurate. 

In the confusion on the main floor, fully understanding the ignorance and incompetence that let Oswald escape in that past that no longer existed.

Rounding the corner of a nearby building



It’s a harrowing journey, and the spot where the yellow card man had met his end. As he begins to walk across the field, he hears a voice before he sees anything. Faintly, Jake can make out something that sounds like “eat’n glack… just eat’n glack”. 

Jake looks around for the source of the sound, he sees it: It’s another yellow card man, standing there, seeming to flicker in and out of existence. His back is to Jake, and his message is clearer now: “Just get the meat and go back, just get the meat and go back…” over and over.  Jake stands there staring at this apparition, unable to piece together what’s going on, the card man flickers away

Displaying extreme calmness, Jimla, you don’t know what you’ve done. You have to go back now.”
“Why
“Jake
“Well who are you?! What’s going on?!”
“Jake
“So you’ve been protecting me?”
“No, like the one here, twigs from that bundle begin to break, and if enough twigs break, the whole bundle can fall apart. It’s our job to keep the bundle together, to harmonize the timelines, to tie up the broken branches.”
“So every time I felt the past harmonizing…”
“There was one of us nearby.” 
Jake stares at the card man
“Jake
And with that, and begins to enter the rabbit hole. 


Emerging through the rabbit hole, nothing seems terribly out of place. Jake takes a deep breath and heads to the front of the diner. As he rounds a corner, he bumps into Al, who is clearly startled as he drops a tray of food and throws his hands to his chest. “Dear lord, Jake, you scared the lights out of me!” 

“I, you’re alright! Oh my God!” Jake finally gets out his intended phrasing, as the two both seem shocked to see one another. 

As Al composes himself, what… what are you doing back here?” 

Jake looks at Al, and he never needed to pass his lifelong mission onto Jake. Jake isn’t supposed to know about the rabbit hole, in fact, he wonders to himself: “Does Al even know about the rabbit hole?”

Al snaps Jake out of his deep chain of thoughts – “uhh Jake, see anything out of the ordinary back there, did you?”
Jake takes a second to collect his thoughts
“Yes, finally cracking a bit of a smile. 

Convincing someone that they exist in an “alternate universe” is never an easy task, a middle-aged women walks into the dinner with a smile on her face and car keys in hand.  

“Well, looks like my ride is here,” says Al. “Jake, this is my wife, Brenda. Brenda, this is a friend of mine Jake, don’t think you two have met.”

Jake and Brenda exchange pleasantries and Jake casts a glance towards Al
“Oh, knows all about the little portal back there. You won’t weird her out with any tales.” 
And so Jake decides to carry on. “Well

“You see Al, a president was shot and killed, and it changed the course of history. You were determined that if you could stop that assassination from happening, the world would be better off.” 

Al’s face is struck with a look of bewilderment

“Oh my God. Are you the fourth man? Jake
“What do you mean?”
“Jake
Jake stares hard at Al


Jake, and being constantly interrupted by Jake’s desire to look up aspects of his former world and see how they’ve changed. He seems relieved to find that most things are exactly the same, or slightly improved. Vietnam still happened, but Martin Luther King Jr. is alive and the world seems to have turned out okay. It looks like Jake meddled with the past just enough to not break the bundle of twigs. 
As the evening comes to a close

On the ride home, he’s struck with feelings of loneliness, and longing for Sadie. He looks at Al, thinking about how amazing it is that Al is alive and healthy. Not just alive and healthy, but happy too! 

Going back to save Sadie would mean risking Al’s life and his relationship with Brenda. Is it his place to put that on the line to try and save Sadie? If the mission was to save Kennedy – then hadn’t he succeeded? Hadn’t everything turned out nearly as perfect as it could? Could he really go back and jeopardize so much just to put an end to his own feelings of loneliness? 

With these thoughts weighing heavy on his mind, gives a smile and walks up the front steps. He lifts the welcome mat at the front door and gives a little smile as he pulls out the key and unlocks the front door. 

“Finally home

Sighing heavily, that he also hears the breathing – that breath in the room that belongs to him, but isn’t coming from his lungs. Somewhere in the back of Jake Epping’s mind a  bundle of twigs makes a crisp snapping noise, and as he glances backwards onto the bed, he turns just in time to see another Jake Epping roll over and open his eyes.

I've read ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and ""The Stand"" when I was in High School. Years later (about a decade), with the most relatable characters, great original stories, and most of all, the best dialog. 

So I began my own ""journey"" to the dark tower.

In the prelude to the gunslinger, and continued to the 2nd book. And the 3rd. And the 4th.

My questions are the following:

Am I too old for this? Why do I not like these books - **at all**? And most importantly (and the reason for the rant

Here are my bones:

* 1) Oy. I hate him. But I also hated the stupid talking raven in the Game of Thrones books. (Overall

* 2) The Wizard of Oz scene. Really. It wouldn't be so bad if he actually *justified* it somehow. Why was it there? What place did it have in the books? I don't know if he justifies it later

* 3) Book 1 failed to establish Roland as any kind of a true badass, Oy agreed. - yeah, we've heard that already too.)

* 4) Love story is weak. I'm sorry.

* 5) Evil Characters are not evil enough or competent enough. With the exception of Gasher. He was well done.
 
* 6) [MACHINE GUNS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQg8JKo_3ZQ) (referring to Alain's use of the ""machine gun"" (which I assume is actually an assault rifle))

* 7) Every time there was a fight scene. Ambiguous details

* 8) Dues Ex Machina so thick you couldn't get through it with a power saw. Whatever

* 9) I knew most of the riddles he used from other sources

* 10) My biggest complaint: The Author Told Us Exactly What Would Happen in Book 4 Before It Happened. **It's NOT foreshadowing if there are no bloody shadows!!**.  And still the book was long. And I had to read the whole dang thing without any kind of surprises at all. He keeps ending chapters or sections with ""And that was the last time he saw her"" or ""Years
