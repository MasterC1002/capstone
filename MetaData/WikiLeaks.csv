Wikileaks began publishing the US embassy Cables on the 28th of November, such as Washington running a secret intelligence campaign targeted at the leadership of the United Nations. The leaked documents show that Saudi Arabia put pressure on the US to attack Iran. Other Arab allies also secretly agitated for military action against Tehran. The cables also revealed Washington's confidential opinions on Gordon Brown's potential successors. David Miliband was deemed ""too brainy"", Alan Johnson had a ""lack of killer instinct"" and Harriet Harman was a ""policy lightweight but an adept interparty operator"". Many of the 250,000 documents are proof of the United States breaking international laws and engaging in secret negotiations, especially in the Middle East region.

 The subduing of Wikileaks recently has been possibly one of the largest perversions of democracy and freedom of speech in modern history. After releasing the first wave of US government documents
 But after the denial of service attacks WikiLeaks moved their IP address to Europe, Amazon gave in to international government pressure and dropped Wikileaks from their servers. Many supporters mirrored the site to keep it on the internet. 
Shorty afterwards, effectively stealing money contributed by donators to the Wikileaks Organization. The main allegation is that the site yielded to US government pressure. In retaliation, a large group of Wikileaks supporters launched Denial of Service attacks against the main PayPal site.

The following day,000 Euro's of Assange's personal assets. The internet group, Anonymous began mass DDoS attacks on the PostFinance, which as of the writing of this article remains offline.
The media is very good at diverting people's attention from the actual issue, it is irrelevant to Wikileaks whether Assange committed any crimes. Secondly, Assange is not wanted for rape, he's wanted for questioning for something called 'sex by surprise' ($750 max fine). After the investigation opened, chief prosecutor Eva Finné overruled the prosecutor on the night the report was filed, withdrawing the warrant to arrest Assange and saying ""I don't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape."" The current charges are not 'rape', but a dispute over consensual but unprotected sex. Prominent US figures have called for Mr Assange's death since WikiLeaks began releasing hundreds of US diplomatic cables.

There is currently no organised public community that I am aware of that is analysing the contents of the leaks.

So

While I'm a decent coder, I'd like to get a few volunteers who will contribute to the development of the wiki and the analysis of the leaks.

Please upvote this so we can make it happen. If anyone has experience running a wiki

I have the domain registered and am setting up MediaWiki as we speak. I aim to have this up and running in the next 2 days.
---------------------------

**Update 1:** I'm looking for some input on effectively structuring the site. I was thinking:

0. Have a glossary page as a reference for all the acronyms in the cables.
1. Title pages by their cable id (e.g. 04NEWDELHI6983)
2. Categorise cables by date
3. Post list of daily cables on the main page of the wiki. That way links to any unanalysed cables will show up in red.


**Update 2:** I'm waiting to get a mailing list approved by freelists

======

Until the site is up

* Writing some guidelines for analysing the cables
* Throwing together a quick logo (135x135) for the site

**Update 3:** Currently writing scripts to get the daily leaks

**Update 4:** Need to sleep so won't be doing any more with it tonight

**Update 5:** Mornin'. I'm going to be coding some of the suggestions made in this thread. I'm contacting those

If the U.S. government considers whistle-blowers terrorists now, which some have likened to Guantanamo Bay.

The Obama Administration showed that it was passively willing to accept the military’s treatment of Bradley when President Obama responded to a question about Bradley’s treatment in March by saying he had been assured by the Pentagon that it was “appropriate.” A few months ago

We want to make it clear that it is unacceptable to treat WikiLeaks, who is accused of revealing war crimes.

**Please make a phone call for Bradley:**

* Call the **Obama/Biden campaign office**: 312-698-3670

When you call

**After calling

* E-mail [Vice-President Biden](http://www.whitehouse.gov/contact-vp)
* E-mail the [Obama/Biden campaign](http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/o2012-about-the-campaign)

I'm sick and tired of people who haven't watched the Collateral Murder

Keeping this post short and getting straight to the point:

 I want a dvd duplicator

Purpose:

To burn the Collateral Murder video to dvd and make mass copies to send to Americans around the Nation. And also burn the Assange interviews/documentaries (once I get written permission) to dvd and send those too.

Why:

Because Fox News

If I have enough supporters I'm changing my entire website for this cause.

In the meantime I started a blackberry group Wikileakors. Here's the barcode to scan to join the group:

Forteller had a good point

Second

Lastly, you can gather signatures, you can create mission statements, you can help educate the public.  Everyone on your facebook page should be with you, everybody that follows you on twitter should be there, all politicians and celebrities that do AMA's should be asked to join.  This is a time for action.  We can do something with this.

I will continue to work on these subreddits throughout the next few weeks.  I need help with CSS and I need help with moderation.  Reddit is the perfect place to start something like this.  We believe in human rights, we fight for marijuana reform and we fight for freedom of speech.  

We all have family and friends who know nothing about what is going on in the world.  That is our fault.  They vote.  Those votes hurt us.  This is our fault.  We must do something.

**Edit regarding insurance files**

[Yes I guess it was claimed that this information was specifically destroyed](http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2011/08/wikileaks-bank-of-america-data-has-been-destroyed). It is surprising that this didn't make it into the insurance file however. I assume:

 * Assange has everything in the file (that he has the key)
 * That the file was real instead of empty.

I suppose a lot of this was discussed back when the Domscheit split occurred.

It drastically changed what I thought of my dad. Why was it so hard for him to see that he was on the ""bad guy"" side? 

Other than changing my opinion of my dad, information was limited by the inability to share it, so it was common for people to not know what was going on in government or across the world. I wonder if past generations have grown comfortable with this lack of openness and information.

I am also a /r/WikiLeaks subscriber. Being a citizen of a European Union member-country I am deeply concerned about this and can only wonder who else will give up my private information.

-----

So here are some questions that I hope the reddit administration could answer officially:

Did any US agency or any other entity (courts

Would the reddit administration inform its users about such requests

What exact information would be given if reddit had to comply?

Would reddit fight legally to counter gag orders

Does reddit comply to such information orders only to the US government or also other countries governments?

If anyone else here has other important questions or has any corrections for mine - please post them.
