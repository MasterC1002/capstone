1358698054.0,16xloy,The Big Cider Making Post,Beer_Is_Food,510,72,155,"Hello everyone. 

I have seen a lot of “How can I make Cider” or “How to xyz my cider” or “my cider tastes like butthole” posts lately and I've been planning on doing one big post as a frame of reference and to try to finally get some concise answers or at least vague advice for people who make cider or are planning to. 


The term ""cider"" is very ambiguous. I see arguments sparking here often of what a “cider” actually is. However


I will attempt to divide this into more simple and concise categories and discuss techniques and strategies for each. First I will make notes on things that are important for any recipe.

These notes are made on research, **I will try to highlight the most important points for those of you (i.e. everyone) skimming**.  


Please give me a few minutes to double-check formatting

- - - - - - - - - - -
Firstly:

There are some things that go for every type of cider you can make:

1) **Do not boil your ingredients**. Do don't unless some particular ingredient that is not fruit requires boiling for extraction. If you boil your juice/fruit/must you will get something that tastes so bad your garbage disposal will spit it back up. 

2) There are three things that are absolutely and completely an ingredient in every recipe.  **Good Juice, do. It will completely make the difference between a typical cider and an incredible drink. However, I make great cider all of the time without spending out the ass on fresh-apple juice. 

-If you are using cheap mott's type juice

3) In these recipes, but frozen works great too. Freezing ruptures the cell walls and helps make it easier for more sugars to be processed by the yeast. What about bacteria? See pasteurization method below. 

- - - - - - - -
Another note on fruit additions

**Primary**

**If you add a few pounds of fruit in primary

However

 I always add fruit at both primary in secondary (if I add fruit).

**Secondary**

**If you want to maintain the color and flavor of your chosen fruit

- - - - - - - - - -

Pasteurization:

There are a few methods of pasteurization. Frozen fruit is usually pasteurized before it's frozen, quicker fermentation and more flavor if you blend and ""mash"" the fruit.  This also applies to frozen fruit.  I have had *wonderful* results with the method shown below. This method was given to me by user Biobrewer, so please send karma or puppies his way:

*I literally mash up the fruit really well (usually a few pulses in the blender is good), then pasteurize for 4-5 minutes at around 170 F. Lastly, I cool by submersion of the pot in an ice bath, sanitize the outside, and funnel the fruit mush into the fermentor and rack the beer on top.* 

- - - - - - - - - -


Okay




1)** Apfelwein / Apple Wine **

*This category is strictly regarding wines that are fermented with a strain of yeast typical to wines such as Montrachet, really good apfelwein is arguably much more complex, generally drier and usually a higher %ABV beverage than other ciders.* 

Strategies In Making your Wine:


-**Do not use Montrachet or Red Wine yeast.** I commonly see Red Star Montrachet yeast suggested as I believe it is in Edwort's Apfelwein recipe. I also commonly see people who use this yeast say their cider tastes like, Montrachet is a great yeast, but it is a Red Wine yeast. Your cider typically should not resemble the thickness, spicyness or richness of a red wine.  Note: Yes, you *can* use Montrachet, but more often than not you are looking at a minimum of 9 months from pitch to glass before it tastes decent and usually it still doesn't. (although we all have preferences that are different). White wine, champagne

-Firstly, it really comes down to how sweet, green or dry you want your wine. **My favorite is 1116(K1V).  A white/champagne hybrid that requires little to no-sweetening for a refreshing flavor in even a young wine (5 months pitch to glass minimum).  If you are on the fence about your apfelwein yeast, use 1116** A little tart, a little sweet, a little dry. 

-Following in favorite would be 1122. To me

-D47 is fine

-**I often steer people away from Champagne yeast because if you're just grabbing regular ol' juice off the store shelf and pitch Red Star Champagne or Lalvin 1118 (Champagne) you're going to end up with something that tastes like fizzy soda water.** Not much flavor and very, very possible to create a good cider like this but if you do, and you want it to pop but still have lots of flavor, use fresh juice, and lots of fruit matter to your primary (i.e. apples,  blueberries, blackberries..whatever).




2)**  Malted Cider **

*This type of cider is typically known as a Graff it is a partially malted and usually lightly hopped cider.  As someone who eats beer for three meals a day

Making your Graff

First Off


-**If you will search “Graff Recipe” you will find a HBT talk thread that will create a dry

-On that note

-**Yeast will contribute nearly the entire character of your cider.** This isn't news for most of you.  Think it through, do a little research or simply start with typical yeasts. WLP001,002,013 are always good places to start. I have done a graff with Saison yeast and it was like nothing I've ever had. Almost more cirtus-ey than apple-ey. But it was a hit on New Years.  I would, however, avoid yeasts that are notorious for generating lots of isoamyl acetate. To me, those banana flavors just clash with the apple. You may have a different opinion. 

-**The guidelines posted in the typical Graff Recipe call for a specific amount of hops and say “if you want to change the hops, I will stick to this advice.** If you just want a typical dry cider, the suggested .5oz Cascade boiled for 30 minutes with your malt is perfect. For those of you mildly experienced, you'll probably realize this hop addition is essentially to lightly enhance existing bitterness without creating an overt, or arguably existent at all, aroma. This is correct. I'm never to positive because I'm always adding fruit which makes measuring OG a bit more of a pain, but I think you're aiming for about 7-14 IBU's in five gallons. So if you want to experiment, but this is really about IBU's


3) ** Typical Ciders **

*This is just a typical cider made with no malt and ale yeast. My favorite commercial example would be Harpoon. I believe their cider is probably the best commercial top-fermented cider. I love looking at the back of the bottle... Ingredients: Fermented Apple Juice. There are no secrets with this drink except that they're actually getting fresh juice from an orchard a few miles away from their production

-There isn't too much to say here because the process is pretty straightforward. Get your juice or make your must

- - - - - - - - - 

Some questions you may have:

**Do I need to make a starter?**

-*Sigh*. Listen, you can get away with pitching just a vial or smack pack. Your cider will turn out fine. Making starters is just a good habit to be in.

-Disregard this if you are using dry yeast

**Does temperature matter?**

-Of course it does. If temperatures are an issue for you


**What if I want to add something to my cider?**

-Then do it, etc. Don't get ambitious. You can always add more, you can't really add less.  


**How long until I can drink it?** 

-How patient are you? For wine yeasts, especially if you're going to just drop it in a keg and drink it in a week.

-You have to remember that fruit is fairly lazily fermenting

-For ales, 1 month secondary. Why do I secondary? Because I do. Don't argue with me about it. If you don't like it, don't do it. I also am usually adding extra juice or fruit to secondary so it's nicer to siphon-on than dump-in.  


**I want to have a sweet, what do I do?**

It depends on whether you bottle or keg


**If you keg. It's easy. You can kill your yeast and add whatever you want.** I usually drink a few glasses back and then add a half gallon of juice to the 4ish gallons remaining. Do you need to add sorbate? I get away with not doing it by keeping everything cold enough

-Original Sin is a very unique cider created by fermenting with champagne yeast

**If you bottle

-When using wine yeast. Primary in one jug. Let it ferment out. Then split it in half between two secondary fermenters half-filled with fresh

-When using ale-yeast

No. If you sanitized as you're supposed to, or brewer's yeast, colony and active fermentation. It could look like any of these:

[exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/HsGwS)  
[exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/Bddje)

or after it's fallen some

[exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/alloH)



All of this is normal. Your krausen could be darker or lighter depending on your beer. Your krausen will fall back into the beer more or less depending on the strain you're using

the following are infections:

[lactobacillius](http://i.imgur.com/XZoWA.jpg)  
[brettomyces

that last one is an *intentional* infection for a Flanders Red. But it still goes to show how completely different an infection looks compared to a healthy krausen. 

now go forth, and have a home brew! If you sanitized and pitched your yeast, you're not going to be seeing any infections 99% of the time, since a healthy yeast colony will block out anything else that's trying to eat your beer. Every fermentation is different, of course, but by and large, fluffy foamy scummy thing is good!

Last night my dog helped me brew(OrangeWit!) and snuck the spent hops out of the garbage. Between finding a bunch of info both credible and not so credible and also talking with the vet I wanted to give you guys a rundown of what I found out about hop-doggycide.


* ingesting hops can trigger malignant hyperthermia in some breeds

* the two main timeframes to be aware of if your dog eats hops: under 10 minutes you can induce vomiting with hydrogen peroxide but dogs are quick digesters so after 10 minutes it's in there. 3-6 hours after eating is the critical time to watch for signs of hyperthermia. If after 8-10 hours nothing is wrong the dog is most likely safe.  

* symptoms of hyperthermia: sets in very quick once it starts! excessive panting; temperature increase of 104+ going up by a degree or two every five minutes: over 108 is a death sentence; hyperactivity combined with muscle stiffness.  

* most of the info on the interwebs about hopsecuting your dog comes from a limited study done 15 years ago - fact is there just isn't a lot of empirical evidence yet but enough people have lost their pets to hops that it's worth being careful.  

* there's a lot of conflicting info out there so be careful. ie: some say pellets are fine but leaf is bad(my vet called bs on this); spent brewed hops are not as harmful as raw(vet said could be true but most dogs leave raw alone and go after wort soaked for the flavor).  

* if you compost your hops

* if you have this happen and want to dig up info on the net

It's been 12 hours now since 'the incident' and my beer is bubbling and my dog seems fine.

After coming home from a relentlessly shitty day at work I decide to have a few quiets just to relax a bit. Because I've not yet got my kegerator parts sorted I'm using my temp controlled freezer as both a home for my kegs and a fermentation chamber for lagering.

I pop open the freezer, what I am faced with is a freezer about three inches deep in dark wheat beer. Somehow the gas line has blown off and every last drop of beer has found it's way out of the keg (I had it on a serious lean to fit everything in there)

I'm gutted and start to take carboys out so I can start cleaning when SLIP! My Vienna lager

I'm pretty much in tears by now, scrubbing with a bottle brush and sanitizing. Pour one glass - black bits floating in what is (probably only for another week or two) the best beer I've ever made.

My brewing heart is officially broken.


**UPDATE**

What an awesome response!

Last night was a low point in my brewing career. I can't adequately explain the soul destroying anguish I went through opening up my freezer to find 19 litres of sweet banana/clove smelling wheat beer looking up at me

Suffice to say

So instead of just throwing everything in the bin and wiping my hands of this whole thing

I'll be churning out three of my favourites - beers that I've loved and have been winners with everyone I've given them to: Fresh Squeezed IPA

I will improve my sparging when I finally have more than one pot and I can circulate my wort. I will probably even get a false bottom in my mash device of choice. 

But right now, and I'll have four batches worth of California lager yeast available for future batches (stout and marzen plus whatever my buddy wants to make). I have almost all the pieces to keep three beers on tap at all time and enough kegs to have one on deck at all times. I have dedicated brewing buddies, a fun online forum where I even had the top post one time. 

I don't plan on competing any time soon (might try and become a certified beer judge though) and I don't pretend like I'm the king of beer or the best thing that ever happened to home brewing.

My fiancé is painfully recovering from full thickness burns stretching across his chest, but he was just so excited.  

He was checking temp on the hot liquor tank but since he was just using a small step-stool, but unfortunately not fast enough to prevent him from injury.

If you set up your brewery right and follow a few simple steps each time you brew, it’s worth reviewing them.

* **Wear proper attire when brewing**

I plan to purchase a flame-retardant apron for my betrothed before he's able to brew again.  For under $30
You should wear rubber boots if you brew in large-enough volumes that a spill could get deeper than the soles of your shoes. For 5-gallon batches of beer
Further

* **Take care when lighting the burners**

Make sure your fire-starter works when lighting propane burners. Don’t wait until the gas is on to find out the lighter is stubborn. If you don’t get the burner to go within 5 seconds or so, and try again.

* **Avoid tripping hazards**

Set up your brewery so you won’t have to step over or duck under anything connected to a heat source or a container of hot liquid. Typically

* **If you can stand it

I know a lot of brewers enjoy doing so alone, it would likely have been much worse.  Which leads me to...

* **Always have a clear path to a cold water source**

If you do get burned, keep it clear of dirty brewing equipment so you can quickly douse a flame or cool a burned area.  Stop, drop and roll didn't work for my better half (but that shouldn't stop you from trying this method) and it wasn't until after what seemed like forever that I put two and two together and rushed to the hose.  

* **Whenever possible

Carrying large volumes of hot water or wort is dangerous. You should never carry any container of hot water that is too heavy to easily manage. If possible

* **Use common sense**

Pay attention to what you're doing.  
Have a fire extinguisher handy.  
Only use propane in well-ventilated areas.  
Install a carbon monoxide detector.  
Don't put hot liquid into glass carboys.  
Make sure your hands aren't wet when moving those carboys.  
Don't brew naked.  
Limit your alcohol consumption until after the brew is finished.  
Keep a first aid kit handy.

I was going to hijack that other AMA because the OP never showed but I think this avoids confusion.

I still do my own homebrewing in a way. We have a 10 gallon small batch system that we invite local homebrewers to brew on and we put the beer  on tap in the tap room. We provide all of the ingredients while they provide the ideas. I also brew on the system all the time.

We also host Big Brew every year. This year we're shooting for 200 gallons!

Additionally our brewery has a barrel aging program and we convinced the owner of the brewery to buy an extra chardonnay barrel for the homebrew club to fill with whatever we want! 10 of us are each going to brew 5 gallons of the same Tripel recipe and age it!

These are just the things I'm doing that are specific to homebrewing

We'll also be entering Pro-Am at GABF this year with a beer I collaborated on with a fellow homebrewer.

TL:DR: Beer aging is complex. The chemicals in beers change based on many factors including; oxygen present in the headspace, aging lowers bitterness and increases *perceived* sweetness, but it's different for all beers.

**Part 1 - Start a business**

The context of the application (Brewer's Notice) is that you already have an existing business.

1. Register as an LLC or Corporation.  My brewery registered as an LLC

2. Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN).  I believe this is done through the IRS

3. Write up a set of bylaws and an operating agreement.  These are very similar and we rolled them into one document.  If you do it that way, how voting is done, how ownership is transferred, and plenty more.  You can download boilerplate documents online, but should spend a good amount of time making them specific to your business.  In my case we have five co-owners and this was the hardest part of the process.  We had to figure out how to divide ownership and what a given type of contribution is worth in that regard.

4. Hold a meeting, secretary and treasurer).

4. Open a business checking account.  Not much to say here

5. Obtain a space.  In theory

6. Get an insurance policy.  This is a good idea in general since you will have valuable equipment and potential liability.  In addition though

Okay

**Part 2 - Build your application package**

1. Visit [TTB.gov](http://www.ttb.gov) to read up on what you want to do

2. The main form to be filled out is the Brewer's Notice.  This is the actual application.  There is plenty more to do, you already need to have the place obtained!), what type of business you are, the amount of beer you expect to produce (there are a few wide ranges) and a list of company officials.

3. Fill out ""Personnel Questionnaires"".  These are a basic background check on all members of your company.  You'll be asked about contact information, parent's names, if you've ever been arrested, citizenship, past addresses, past employers, references and a bank reference for each member of the company.

4. Fill out the Environmental Information form.  Here you make your best guesses as to how much of any chemical you'll use, but wasn't really asked about it in the phone interview.

5. Fill out the Water Quality Considerations form.  Again

6. Fill out the Signing Authority form... this is the members who will be allowed to sign documents on behalf of the company.  This form (and possibly others) requires either a corporate seal or the minutes from a meeting that show the election of officers (remember that from part 1?)

7. In addition to all of those forms, a diagram of your brewery, photo ID (photocopy) of the person filing, minutes of the meeting to elect officers, brewer's bond in duplicate (provided by insurance agent), bank statements from the business account, lease agreement (needs to specifically state that brewing is allowed on premises), legal description of the property (available at city hall).

8. You'll need to create a security statement.  This details entries and exits, hours of operation, etc.  They don't require a high level of security, but just want to know what you have.  They said it was in case they need to raid... not sure if that was a joke!

9. Create a Trade Name Statement.  This can be one sentence stating the name you'll be selling beer under.  It's probably the same as your business name

10. If you have your bylaws and operating agreement rolled into one document

11. Create a statement with the names of the banks members have used to contribute any funds to the company.

Once you have all of this stuff, call in and schedule a phone interview.  They are actually very helpful and totally on your side.  In my interview, they simply went through a few corrections, all of which I was able to do verbally over the phone.  I received a call less than a week later letting me know that it was approved and an email was to be sent out immediately, followed by original copies of the documentation in the mail.

A few tips:

 - To get things moving more quickly, and others were required for the bond application(s).  Get licensed, then do the paperwork to add people in as owners/members.

 - Include people who know something about business and business law.  I am fortunate to have a friend who manages a restaurant chain and one who is a corporate accountant.  They helped me make much more informed decisions throughout the process. 

 - Take your time on the bylaws/operating agreement.  We really had to do some creative thinking to work out a way to allocate ownership and to allow that to change as time went on.  When we wrote it up, the finished document has held up and already provided guidance for changes that have been made.

--musashiXXX

**EDIT #1** The contest will feature the following style categories:

* BJCP 10A. American Pale Ale
* BJCP 16C. Saison
* BJCP 7B. California Common
* BJCP 19. Barleywine
* BJCP 5. Bock

**If you plan on participating in the APA (BJCP 10A. American Pale Ale) category...**

This is the first year we're having an ""international"" competition: the APA category (BJCP 10A. American Pale Ale) is going to be judged by our Canadian judge: [KFBass](http://reddit.com/user/KFBass). This means that you shouldn't enter unless you:

* live in Canada
* do not live in Canada but you are able/willing to ship to Canada

The rest of the categories will be judged in the U.S. so you shouldn't enter these categories unless you:

* live in the U.S.
* do not live in the U.S. but are able/willing to ship to the U.S.

**Remember:** It is illegal to ship alcoholic beverages in many countries via the postal service. You will have to use a private carrier such as (but not limited to) FedEx


**EDIT #2** Tentatively

**EDIT #3** Submissions must be in the form of two (2) bottles

**EDIT #4** Three judges have been confirmed:

* [mjap52](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mjap52) - Saison
* Denny Conn - Bock
* [KFBass](http://www.reddit.com/user/KFBass) - APA (Canada)

**EDIT #5** Final list of judges:

* [mjap52](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mjap52) - Saison
* Denny Conn - Bock
* [KFBass](http://www.reddit.com/user/KFBass) - APA (Canada)

It appears that most of us here at r/homebrewing have been brewing for quite some time and are pretty serious about it. I see a lot of passion and pride in each posting of a new brew. Perhaps we can come together to bring our BEST recipes to the table for a Reddit Homebrew Book. I realize there is a recipe section/thread but I would bet that if we take a few weeks and really work together on this we could come up with an amazing resource.

Here are some initial thoughts on how this might go:

* take some time to discuss and come to a consensus on the process.
* set a time frame for submitting your favorite ""best-of-the-best"" recipe
* structure the book so as to cater to both beginner and advanced skill level. Perhaps we break it up into two sections: All Grain &amp; Extract/Partial Mash
* Set a limit for each beer style
* Create a standardized template for each recipe to ensure consistency (and to make it pretty). I know there are many templates out there for homebrew recipes.
* Once all submissions have been made a panel of ""editors"" (perhaps the Mods) Will analyze the recipes for accuracy/correctness and the book will be published. We can publish a nice PDF

Thoughts?

**Update** This is exciting to see so much interest. It appears we need a consensus for the recipe format. BeerXML is popular but there is still a question of how to display it on a page in the book (layout). [This](http://www.brew-monkey.com/recipes/html/caplager.htm) kind of layout may work

It looks like it may be best method of submission may be via an external website. I have the means to get a simple site up and running to get us started.

I don't see the 2011 winners having a recipe posted. Its possible that not everyone will be willing to share their recipe. We may just need to ping the winners of the last contest to see if they would be willing to share.

**Update 2** There is quite a bit of interest to expand this beyond a simple PDF. Perhaps we can start with compiling some great recipes for a Vol. 1 book and morph that into a website as needed.

So I tried to answer the age-old question: How long does it take to sanitize my stuff? This quick experiment has some serious limitations, what I did.

I grew up some *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (a common bacterium found just about everywhere) overnight in LB. LB is a standard growth medium for bacteria; it comes in liquid (broth) and solid (agar) forms. I took some of this culutre and contaminated some things:

First

I also took some plastic culture tubes and filled them with 2 mL clean LB broth each and put 200uL of the overnight culture into each (1:10 dilution). I put these in the warm room to grow for 6 hours. At the end

I then treated each slide or tube. For the slides

1 - just dunked in 0.5% phosphoric acid

2 - submerged for 1 minute in 0.5% phosphoric acid

3 - submerged for 5 minutes in 0.5% phosphoric acid

4 - submerged for 10 minutes in 0.5% phosphoric acid

5 - just dunked in 5% bleach

6 - submerged for 1 minute in 5% bleach

7 - submerged for 10 minutes in 5% bleach

8 - nothing

I then took all 8 coverslips and rinsed them with 10mL of tap water. I placed each one on an LB-agar plate

Then I treated the tubes. First

1 - just fill

2 - Fill with 0.5% phosphoric acid

3 - Fill with 0.5% phosphoric acid

4 - Fill with 0.5% phosphoric acid

5 - just fill

6 - Fill with 5% bleach

7 - Fill with 5% bleach

8 - rinse with 5x volumes of tap water

The phosphoric acid tubes got no further treatment. Bleach tubes were each rinsed with 5 volumes of tap water. This was actually very interesting...the phosphoric acid was so dilute I didn't expect it to do much

I then put 2mL of sterile media in each tube and put them in the warm room overnight to grow.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/bVXyW.jpg) is a bit of an idea of what we're talking about here.

The results were not as exciting as I had hoped. The only [plate](http://i.imgur.com/2eIMD.jpg) that grew anything was #8; the one that just got rinsed off with water. The rest were just as blank as the right side of that plate, but it works.

[Tubes](http://i.imgur.com/XPspM.jpg) were a little better. Two grew stuff. As expected, remnants of StarSan left in a tube will not inibit growth. Second, one minute is enough to kill common bacteria.

Now....the limitations. First, but in this study what they lack in quality they make up in quantity. These tubes would have had ~200,000,000+ bacteria in each of them. *Pseudomonas* is a pretty good model for your general bugs you'll find around the home. It's relatively hardy (even the lab strain is relatively hardy), it's damn near everywhere, and it's kind of the jack-of-all-trades bug. But this is not testing for activity against molds. Other stuff, too

Second, you can be damn sure the real stuff does.

So

That's it. I'm sure there are other caveats, but hey...it's fun to screw around.

I've since written an email back and suggested they start a website and/or program to offer them up to homebrewers and any other interested parties who are willing to cover whatever handling costs there are. They could even chop them up into chips to make for easy shipping and additions to fermenters

Anyway

5 gal Indian Summer Apple Cider
1.67 lbs White Sage Honey
1.67 lbs Crystal Light Brown Sugar
5 tsp. Yeast Nutrient
2.5 tsp. Yeast Energizer
White Labs 775 English Cider Yeast
OG: 13.5 brix/1.054 sg

The trick with store bought apple juice is that it has to be unpreserved in order to ferment. As long as the ingredient list doesn't say Sodium Benzoate or Potassium Sorbate (or some other preservative) you're good to go. 

I made a simple syrup out of the sugar and honey by boiling it in a small amount of water for about 5 minutes to sterilize it. Other than that

* Sanitizing everything is very important
* It takes a lot to actually ruin a beer. Chances are yours will turn out fine. Maybe even great.

An older couple answered the door and led us to the basement.  The person I had emailed (a female) was not home.  She was the older couple's daughter-in-law.  Well after we loaded up a few boxes of bottles, kettles, wine making stuff, and a ton of stuff I had never seen before.  Anyway, on the way out of the house on our trips to the car, we noticed the funeral flowers all over the house...

So I get home and I'm unloading/organizing the bottles and I come across three full bottles.  It says something ""----- ale"" on top

I'm kind of curious to try the beer

I can post pictures of the bottles later if there is any interest.

UPDATE: Thanks for all of the comments!  I just took all of your advice and emailed his wife and offered to send his wife and parents a bottle if they would like it.  I'll keep you updated.  I hope it will cheer her up.  I'll also post a picture when I get home.  I think I'm going to stick the other bottle in the fridge when I get home and try it tonight.

UPDATE 2: Leaving work now (1615 EST)... Will post a picture of the bottles when I get home and put one in the fridge!

Here we go. First a glossary. *HLT* is Hot liquor Tank. *CLT* is cold liquor tank. *MLT* is mash/lauter tun. *WP* is whirlpool. *HE* heat exchanger. *AV* aging vessel, Celsius, and KGs.

*ME!* I'm 24, chemistry, biology, or engineering in college. In fact I studied Jazz Bass performance so you can imagine how useful that is. My brewmaster must've seen something special in me or took pity, either way I'll take it.

The brewery does 20HL batches 2x a day. It's a team of 4 people plus the brewmaster not counting forktruck drivers or warehouse people. Sometimes we can push out 3 brews a day if we have one guy start early and one guy stay later. Another thing

The day breaks down to two types of people. Assistants

I'll start with Assistants. Get into work

before starting the filter confirm it was sanitized, we pressurize a tank to 15psi, punch out the yeast at the bottom. Sometimes we collect said yeast in a bucket for future use, sometimes not depends on the brew and generation. once all that is done and hooked up to the filter you dose DE powder inline with the incomming beer which helps disperse it through the filter bed. Downstream whatever DE is leftover in the now brite beer is caught in a 5 micron trap filter (which by observing the pressure differential you can determine if the trap needs changing). usually by the time the filter run has started it is time for the first digout. 

Digging out the mashtun is dome semi manually. We turn on the mash rakes

After break, now is a really good time to clean up the powder area, and clean out my buckets or maybe assist the other guy in sanitizing some tanks/perform some maintenance. 

Once the filter run is done (usually a HL every 1-2min x40HL = before lunch) you throw it into a loop, caustic is added and looped through the tank for x amount of minutes. it's then rinsed, rinsed again by hand and disconnected from the pump to setup for the next tank. Usually during this time the second digout will have happened.

Then the filter needs cleaning, you can start refilling the filter and sanitizing it.

During this whole time a second guy is running aorund performing various maintenence tasks (like detail cleaning the bottling line

I almost forgot to mention getting inside the mash tun. Once a day

near the end of the day, then put into a bucket of sanitizer. All parts are put away, hoses are walked out, then wrapped and hung back up. Basically our tankhouse looks the same when we start every day. We have one of the cleanest breweries ive ever seen, and it is through very frequent communication that we accomplish everything and wrap it all back up nicely by the end of the day.

*Brewer*

The brewer has a completely different day then the tankhouse people. They get in, the mash in begins. As stated usually the tankhouse guys will dump the specialty grains. Our grain mill is located directly one floor above the mash tun. 2row is delivered from a silo via auger to the mill, and the tankhouse guys mix specialty grains (down to the kilo) buy hand into the mill. 

We mash for 15mins (I know...15 mins seems redic). After that it's sparge time. we fly sparge for 70mins (also redic). During the 1st bit of the sparge we use graivty, the whirlpool is being sanitized, hops are being weighed out, salt additions are weighed out, brewbrite finings are hydrated etc..

Once the liquid in the kettle reaches the volume needed we bring it to a boil and we all know about that I hope. While this boil is started, and you are ready to begin all over again! Somebody dumps specialty grains, the silo and auger do their thing and away we go.

since we have a 3 vessel brewery (MLT, you spray out the Kettle, then begin the sparge of the 2nd mash.

we WP for 20mins, while still allowing for the now hot water coming out of the HE to be at an appropriate temp to sparge with (every drop counts). this is a fun time of the day involving alot of attention to pump speeds and temps. Always stressful.

after that it's a pretty easy day. lather rinse repeat on the brewing. ONce all the liquids are transfered and cooled out its just cleanup. spray out and Caustic the kettle

I left out alot of details because every brewhouse is different. Also the spelling and grammatical errors can go suck it. I'm just trying to convey a sense of what a day is like for a brewer. Our brewhouse is very manual

Im sure this is going to start a storm

A simple definition of brewing is the infusion, sanitization and isomerization of alpha acids.  Lets look at each of these objectives in turn.


**Color and Flavor**

Boiling your wort produces flavor and color compounds through the maillard reaction.  The maillard reaction is the same chemical reaction responsible for the browning of toast and is similar to caramelization.  Caramelization is the reaction that takes place when sugars are exposed to temperatures in excess of 350°F.  The temperature in the boil will not rise much above 212° and as such caramelization can not occur.  What does occur is the maillard reaction that occurs between sugars and amino acids and it can occur at  temperatures achievable in boiling wort.  Maillard compounds can produce a range of flavors


**Reduction of Proteins**

Temperatures reached during boiling cause proteins found in the wort  to denature and then coagulate into larger clumps that can then settle out of the wort.  This makes boiling an effective way to remove proteins that could ultimately cause chill haze in the beer.   You can visually observe this process as the wort first comes to a boil and foam begins to build on top of the wort.  If the pot is too small


**Sanitization**

 From my prior article on working with extracts, which is the reduction of all microorganisms, but a 15 minute minute boil will give you a sufficient level of sanitization so that your choice of yeast is not out competed by wild yeast and bacteria.


**Isomerization of Alpha Acids**

While not the only contributor, and in order to extract the bitterness in a form that will dissolve into your beer it is necessary to boil them.  But there is a trade off, as the more volatile compounds responsible for flavor and aroma  will be driven off while boiling. Boiling causes the alpha acids to undergo isomerization, a change in chemical structure producing iso-apha acids that are soluble in water.  The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness that will be extracted  from the hops.  This is why bittering hops are traditionally added at the beginning of the boil.

Go read John Palmer's [Crash Course In Brewing](http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter1.html). It's 5 short pages that walks you through the entire homebrewing process. Also read through the [Glossary](http://www.howtobrew.com/glossary.html) to get a feel for some common terms.

**Sounds good. What equipment do I need?**

Here's what I would recommend:  

 - [6.5 gallon fermenting bucket w/lid](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/6-5-gallon-fermenting-bucket.html) or [6 gallon better bottle](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/better-bottle-plain-6-gallon.html) or [6 gallon carboy](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/6-gallon-glass-carboy.html)  
 - [Thermometer](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/large-dial-thermometer-9-probe.html)  
 - [6.5 gallon bottling bucket](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/fermenting-equipment/6-5-gallon-bottling-bucket.html) (read jnish's comment below on how to ferment and bottle in the same carboy/bucket) w/ [spigot](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/bottling-spigot-for-bottling-bucket.html)  
 - [Airlock](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/three-piece-airlock.html)  
 - [Hydrometer](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/thermohydrometer.html)  
 - [Tubing](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/3-8-clear-hi-temp-tubing.html)  
 - [Bottling wand](http://www.homebrewit.com/aisle/p/4861)  
 - [Capper](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/red-baron-emily-capper.html)  
 - [Wine Thief](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/3-piece-thief-plastic.html)
 - About 50 Bottles and [60 caps](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/plain-gold-caps-144-ct.html)
 - Sanitizing solution ([StarSan](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/star-san.html)
 - Large Pot (called a kettle) - 8-10 gallon stainless would be ideal for full boils. I wouldn't pay money for anything smaller than a 20 qt (5-gallon) for partial boils. Aluminum or enamel-coated will work as well. 
 - [Extract recipe kit](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/irish-red-ale.html) including extract, yeast and priming sugar.  

**That's a lot of stuff. Where should I get it?**

The cheapest way to get everything but the wine thief

**What about a Mr. Beer kit?**

I wouldn't pay money for one

**Any tips to simplify my first beer?**

 - I'd recommend an ale for your first beer as they're typically less work.  
 - Oktoberfest is a delicious beer
 - Before you start *anything*
 - 1 gallon of diluted StarSan is plenty to sanitize everything. If you use distilled water
 - TAKE AN INITIAL HYDROMETER READING.  
 - I'd use dry yeast for your first beer. Dry yeast is idiot proof: take it out of the fridge (an hour before you need it), aerated wort.  
 - Skip secondary fermentation. It's not necessary for a basic ale and skipping it will not affect the quality of your beer in any way. Instead
 - Cut a short piece of hose and connect your bottling wand directly to the spigot for one-handed bottling. [Like this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/gallery/data/1/best954.jpg).

The quickest way to determine what kind of plastic something is made of is by looking at its [recycle code](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Plastic-recyc-01.svg) if it has one.  The breakdown is below:

**RC 1 - polyethylene terepthalate (PET)**

Most commonly seen as plastic coke bottles, though, is that at high temperatures or sunlight exposure, it can degrade and release potential harmful products like phthalates and heavy metal catalysts.

*tl;dr:  Good properties for homebrewing


**RC 2 and 4 - high and low density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE)**

Extremely common plastic.  High density (RC 2) is what is used in plastic bottle caps and hardhats.  Low density (RC 4) is what milk jugs are made of.  From a chemical point of view

*tl;dr:  Excellent from a health point of view


**RC 3 - polyvinyl chloride (PVC)**

This is most commonly seen as PVC pipe, the safer it is for homebrewing.  In order to make them more flexible, chemicals are added which can leach into your beer and potentially cause problems.  There is still a large amount of debate about the safety of PVC.

*tl;dr: While a useful plastic


**RC 5 - Polypropylene (PP)**

Very similar in structure to polyethylene


*tl;dr:  Safe and useful.  Slightly higher melting point than polyethylene.  Keep out of sunlight.*

**RC 6 - Polystyrene (PS)**

Polystyrene is used in a wide variety of places.  It is used to make styrofoam as well as in take-away food containers and plastic flower pots.  It is relatively brittle at room temperature , I would be uncomfortable heating polystyrene, but you can take whatever risks you would like.

*tl;dr: Brittle at room temperature


**RC - 7 Other (most commonly polycarbonate)**

RC-7 is the catch-all for other plastics and tells pretty much nothing about the chemical structure.  The most common plastic seen with RC-7 is polycarbonate (hard nalgene bottles/baby bottles).  This was the plastic that caused the whole BPA scare.  It's generally fine for room temperature liquids

*tl;dr:  This code tells you little.  Generally best to avoid the unknown.*

Ever since my first batch a couple of years ago, and being in control. I enrolled in the Siebel Institute this past winter and when I felt my business plan was ready enough started a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ovalbrewing/the-oval-brewing-company-the-best-damn-beer-in-the). 

The campaign is going great so far

http://vimeo.com/37571657

[This page](http://ovalbrewing.com/kickstarter-reddit-rewards/) goes into more detail

One of the cool things about Kickstarter is it can track where backers originate from… and we thought it would be a great idea to keep track of and thank Reddit backers in a special way. If the total pledges originating from Reddit are $10, but you will get the opportunity to help crowd-source one of our first beers. You will get to vote on the label design, style, strength, and name! And regardless of your pledge level, your Reddit username will be displayed on the can*!




* Our Kickstarter Campaign: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ovalbrewing/the-oval-brewing-company-the-best-damn-beer-in-the
* Our Website: http://ovalbrewing.com/
* Kickstarter Reddit Rewards: http://ovalbrewing.com/kickstarter-reddit-rewards/

Cheers!

Redbenn

AMA anything about my experience so far... Siebel, real estate, etc

*There are some rules around what we can and can't put on a label

I did some digging and found [this little bugger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide) that is present in our homebrews.

Notice that it is present in green veggies (surprise) as well as maltodextrins or cellodextrins

Feel free to PM me or visit my beginner's sub at /r/schoolofhomebrew with any questions about getting started homebrewing. If you're just starting out I've posted [Beginner's Brew Day Instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1dfkbj/written_instructions_beginners_first_brew_day/).

Call the **/r/schoolofhomebrew Q&amp;A line at 404-860-BEER** Leave a comment with your questions or give your feedback. 

When you get started most recipes kits make 5 gallons of beer. **The DIY buckets can only accommodate 4 gallon batches.** But to simplify your first batch of homebrew (and every other batch for that matter) I recommend making two fermenters and putting 4 gallons in one fermenter as the recipe instructs and experimenting with the remaining wort (wort is unfermented beer) in the second fermenter. 

One nice part of getting into Homebrew DIY is you can start with a small investment and can make purchases over the several weeks you your first batch is fermenting.:


**DIY HOMEBREW FERMENTER &amp; SANITIZER INSTRUCTIONS** 

What you will need (LHBS=Local Homebrew Shop):

1.	Power Drill
2.	½” Spade Bit
3.	Permanent Marker
4.	1 Food Grade Plastic Bucket (Available at Lowe’s)
5.	1 Food Grade Plastic Lid (Available at Lowe’s)
6.	1 x Rubber Grommet - 1 x 5/8”OD x 5/16”ID
7.	2.5 feet - clear vinyl tubing (3/8” OD x 1/4""ID) or an airlock (@LHBS)
10.	Thermometer (@LHBS)
11.	Hydrometer (@LHBS

Fermenter Assembly Instructions

1.	Remove lid’s safety band.
2.	Place lid on bucket.
3.	Using 1/2” Spade Bit Drill near the center of the lid.
4.	Insert 5/8”OD x 5/16”ID Rubber Grommet into hole.
5.	Fill and Mark Bucket at 1 Gallon Increments (1 gallon = 16 cups) with your permanent marker.
6.	Insert either 3/8” OD x 1/4""ID clear vinyl tubing blow off tube or airlock into lid’s grommet.
7. Make Sanitizing Solution

**MAKE A SANITIZING SOLUTION**

The first step to making good beer is to have proper sanitizing habits. Before your beer is fully fermented it is susceptible to bacteria that can impact the flavor of your beer or even ruin your batch. Mix a Sanitizing Solution in the spray bottle and it keep handy for anything that will touch your wort or beer.  

What you will need (LHBS=Local Homebrew Shop):

1. 32 oz Spray Bottle
2.	Sanitizer (LHBS)

Sanitizer Instructions

1.	Fill Spray Bottle with 32 oz 
2.	Fill Spray Bottle with ¼ oz Sanitizer and shake
3.	Done!  

Once your fermenter and sanitizer is complete you can use it to make beer. **Do not fill your 5 gallon buckets past the four gallon mark**. You will need to leave about 1 gallon of room during fermentation [(Read Your Palmer)](http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter8-2-2.html). 
Do not overfill your fermenter (the result may be an explosive mess). As I recommended earlier

Assuming you have access to a 5 gallon pot or kettle

**DIY BOTTLING BUCKET INSTRUCTIONS**

What you will need (LHBS=Local Homebrew Shop):

1.	Electric Drill
2.	5/8” Spade Bit
3. 1 x 5 gallon Food Grade Plastic Buckets (Available at Lowe’s)
4. 1 x Rubber Grommet - 1x 13/16 OD X 1/2”ID
5. 1 x Lead Free Brass Hose Barb - 3/8 ID x 1/4MIP
6. 1 x Lead Free Brass Pipe Bushing - 3/8MIP x 1/4FIP
7. 2 #4 Hose Clamps
3.	50 x Bottle Caps (LHBS)
4.	1 x Bottle Capper (LHBS)
5.	PBW or OxyClean Free (LHBS or Dollar Store)
6. 1 x bottling wand (LHBS)
6.	3/4 cup Corn Sugar (LHBS or Grocery Store)
7.	40 x Bottles (LHBS or collect)

Bottling Bucket Assembly Instructions

1.	If you are concerned about lead in the brass fittings – treat them. [Read Your Palmer](http://www.howtobrew.com/appendices/appendixB.html)
2.	Measure and Mark 1 inch from bottom of bucket
3.	Using 5/8” spade bit drill hole centered at 1 inch mark
4.	Insert  13/16 OD X 1/2”ID rubber grommet into hole
5.	Screw the Brass Hose Barb into the hole from the outside 
6.	Screw the Brass Pipe Bushing onto the Barb from inside the bucket (optional but recommended)
7.	Make sure seal is tight (Add water and check for leaks)
8.	Connect one end of on-toxic pvc tubing to the barb
9.	Use a hose clamp to secure the tighten tubing on the barb (optional but recommended) 
10.	Connect other end of hose to bottling wand.
11.	Use a hose clamp to secure the tighten tubing on the barb (optional but recommended)


**Transfer from Fermenter to Bottling Bucket**

What you will need:

1. 4 feet food grade 3/8"" tubing (LHBS)
2. Fermenter
3. Bottling Bucket

Racking Instructions

1. Sanitize everything that will touch the wort
2. Place Fermenter on elevated surface to the Bottling Bucket (I put the fermenter on the counter and have the bottling bucket on the floor.
3. Using tube

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

*Cleaner – This is serious stuff so wear gloves while working with it. Use it to clean your kettle, and takes a lot of rinsing or it will leave spots –if you can afford it buy PBW. 
 
*Hydrometer – You’ll use the hydrometer to measure the OG, or Final Gravity.
