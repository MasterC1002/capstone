Why do you do the shit you do? Cause what choice you'd make in a given scene be central to who and what YOU are. And what YOU are is your memories and hardwiring. If you do what you do cause shits all random

What the fuck a choice anyway? A jellyfish ain't got no choice. They do all that jelly shit they do cause they got preprogrammed responses to external stimuli.

I feel the phenomology of animals is more similar to ours than we usually admit. When you see an animal in distress, so why make the distinction? 

So I think chickens have objects. What I mean is, so she was looking all around for the food. Then she walks forward to where she was looking, kicks all the hay away, walks back and looks again, finds the food, and eats it. This takes a concept of space (I would think) very similar to ours, and also an object 'food' that she would want say maybe with hunger or that nameless craving you get when it's 2am and your drunk and there's still that shitty burrito place open that you love and you're not hungry but why the fuck not. Not all our experiences can or are put into language, I feel like we can get a better idea of how a chicken would feel

But a chicken doesn't have words for food, shit's my jam"", so what do they feel, or how can we talk about what they feel if it cannot be talked about by the person feeling that feel. We can definitely look at how they act and make analogy to how we feel when we act like that, but we also have language, so when we feel sadness, we conceptualize that feeling as sadness as we are feeling it. Would a chicken feel sad if it can't know it's feeling sad?

""Sure you can!"" Says smug asshat

Hey shit-for-brains, sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up!

Oh really? And how is that any different from a guess? Are guesses and hunches now knowlegde? That shit's nothing but an inference based on facts. Sometimes that shit comes out true, how can some fucker know something before experiencing that knowledge? The fuck does it even mean to know some shit before you experience learning that shit? 

""Okay bro, I don't know!""

Before I answer, nature is the same thing as reality. The fuck is being *above* reality? Why even say something exists above nature and then stop there and not explain why they're different? Fuck whoever thought of that idea. Fuck dat shit. Fuck. Dat. Shit.

Now with that out of the way, otherwise you're just pulling shit out of your ass like some fuckhead. And if that shit does effect our shit, it's open to scientific inquiry. All of it. So fuck you!

renderin' fractals is basically iterating the same fuckin' mathematical function over and over again forever recursively. fuckin recursion is when the product of an algorithm is also a parameter, and they seem to act on the universe recursively. gnome sayin? the universe kinda looks like one giant mothafuggin fractal, showin all the classic self-similarities 'n shit. as above so below, BITCH.

so shit, i can't dispute empirical evidence. so we got all this language that's another layer on top of these reactions, and sure we can give big ups to our postmodern existential indeterminacies 'n shit, but that's just like puttin' a pseudorandom number generator to make sure the fractals we render ain't boring as fuck. (shit works)

my main man, and all wholes are parts of larger wholes. in fuckin' fractal talk, each and every part contains self-similarity to a whole. ain't sayin it has the whole in it, but just some similar representation, dawg. ain't sayin' its atman, but it's atman.

so what we all be spittin' about when we say meaning? if we got a fuckin' tree, sayin it's relative, and all the things that ain't trees are what makes 'trees' trees. i wanna say, ain't each word entailing our entire existential meaning? at the same time, that's whack. aint no way brains can compare each word to every other word we ever fuckin known every time we spit. or is there? can a word contain the negation of (or relation to) every other word a nigga done ever learned? if so, does every nigga contain a negation, or relation to, i must be trippin.",t5_2s8w2,True

Check it.

Anyone who spends any fucking time on the internet probably runs across some amount of social progressive shit, anti-racist shit, pro-gay shit, and all kinds of shit like that. And to me it makes fucking sense. And I don't even mean the obvious shit, like equal rights and whatnot. I mean advanced goddamn concepts, like the existence of rape culture, intersectionality, all that shit. Not to mention categories of oppression that no one fucking thinks of, et fucking al. To straight white male me

Okay, gay marriage, Obamacare, new pronouns, better sex ed, trans rights, worker's rights

And there's one other thing they say, makes total fucking sense:

&gt; The personal is political.

Meaning, no shit, because politics is about people after all, not about planets or ducks or whatever the fuck else. Again, 10 fucking 4.

**But here's the punchline, doing your job right and being professional and shit are actually kind of goddamn important. If your ass gotta be at work at 8am, and your lived experience is that you don't like getting up in the morning, well fuck you, cause your next lived experience is you're gonna be fired if you don't get your ass moving. Nobody gives a fuck how you feel, it just matters what you do. But it balances out, cuz maybe trying to be actually fucking useful to other homies makes you a better homie, but it's the truth. And maybe I'm missing something, cuz in reality

There's all kinds of other shit like that, and zie can't go cryin' to somebody else every time zie doesn't get what zie wants. Not to mention, as much as we all hate the shit out of tradition, guess what, the world is a lot older than you, and people in the past probably figured out some shit that you need to know now. Ignore at your peril, mofo.

And to do all this it's tremendously fucking helpful to have the idea that it's your *job* to be that way, entitled, miserable asshole, and I don't think even the feminist bloggers want to be bros with a mofo like that. And how exactly is that mofo helping the fucking cause anyway? Beats the shit otta me.

I'll try and wrap this fucking tome of a post up. Basically

1. Social progressivism is trying to put a stop to some real fucked up shit

2. Progressivism includes the idea (""The personal is political"") that being a progressive is not just a set of ideas about shit far away

3. But to live life effectively, delay gratification, learn from tradition, and generally right-wing it up all over this bitch.

1340082672.0,v9hc8,"What makes words like ""fucking"" and ""bitch"" offensive? How would Derrida deconstruct this shit? ",PimpinTheLibrary,32,5,14,"so this is my first post and i've been thinking about my boi Derridawg

So when we use language we divide the meaning into two parts, the difference between the information received in the first and second versions seems almost more important than the literal meaning, and this difference is style. The literal meaning is everything that represents the conditions of satisfaction (for all my speech act theorist bitches). Swear words place a lot of emphasis on the style aspect.
This is where my nigga Derridawg comes in. We understand swear words in their relations with their non-offensive synonyms. ""Shit"" is linked with ""excrement""
Language-using bros like us also try to hook up the signifier with the fucking signified. But swear words, the signifier is in fact a presence that stands in for the absent piece of excrement. However, the offensive nature is fully present: the offensiveness is there simply by using the word: there is no absent thing being referred to. The presence-absence opposition thus does not function in this case. 
But that's not all, but when swear words are used for their offensive nature alone, they aren’t communicating any information (any propositional content) that would give any reason to suppose that the person is devalued, noamsayin?. Thus we have an uncertainty with regards to whether it is truly possible for swear words to be offensive.  The ""offensiveness"" of words like ""fuck"" and ""bitch"" exists, it's just unstable as fuck.


Anyway, sorry guys), is dis shit legit? or is there another way fucking swear words work, (or don't)?

I'm talking about that kind of ""nothing"" (I'm keeping with the quotes motherfucker). So I gots to thinking and here's a little 'proof' or some shit about why ""nothing"" ain't no thing. 

So let's say ""nothing"" means ""having no properties"" because shit, it'd be fucking something. So lets call the set of all properties P. [as I'm writing this I think I've begged the question but hold up] So then ""nothing"" is the statement (for every p in P)(~p(x)) for some fucking x. So, x is nothing because it has no properties, right, and so this statement is always true. Now we got my bro p'(a), which is the statement ""(for every p in P)(~p(a)) for some fucking a"". Obviously p'(a) is a property, so substitute that shit in and you get ~(~p(x)) for some fucking x, and so ""nothing"" ain't no thing.

So the video is of Mark Cuban throwing away energy bracelets shaming the NBA for selling them.  For those that don't know energy bracelets basically work via the placebo affect.  An advertiser sells a regular plastic bracelet and says

Two scenarios:
1)
A conventional idiot that actually does not know about the placebo affect wears the bracelet

2)
What fucks me up with this

I guess at the end of the day if you just have something reminding you  to do something and you do it you are more likely to be doing it.  So is the bracelet just a microcosm of planning out an aspect of your life?

To me that's behaviorlism, cos I have to watch myself do things. Be cognizant of my doing things, and then act on it. So of course Behavioralism's all like, shit man when you act on that, you've fuckin realized it of course. But i'm all nah man, you can't explain my experience, and my possible transmission of an analog of that expeierence though language, a me to see all that shit that i could theoretically disect and categorize and conceptualize.

This particular debate has the same logical abandon that only makes sense when I explain the context.

I often find myself feeling in the mood for high-brow conversation when drunk. It is not that I don't feel that way when sober but I seem to be under the delusional feeling that people will care when drunk and that my beliefs will have some philosophical relevance

My question to reddit (and quite frankly everyone) Is this an aspect of humanity? the need for intellectual debate or is this a particular quirk of mine? If so do any others feel my imperative?

I don't say this for any kudos or credit I simply ask: Does alcohol make you question life and existence more or am I pre-disposed to think of such thing and alcohol just enhances the inevitable?

p.s to call myself inebriated right now would be a polite understatement. If it was not for spell check this entire diatribe would be illegible...",self,t5_2s8w2,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckingphilosophy/comments/yd5cp/an_introspective_diatribe_on_alcohol_when_drunk/

Background
The first thing I would like to say is that I am not trying to convert anyone. Everything that follows is simply my view on the topic. I consider myself a person who ponders the meaning and existence of life quite a bit. I would say more than others

I had the wonderful opportunity to grow up in a family that had very loose religious ties. My parents never forced me into a particular religion besides requiring me to go to a Christian elementary school and a Mennonite middle school. Besides school I was never required to go to church or participate in other religious activities if I did not want to. When high school came around my parents moved me to a public school. At first I was very nervous

Logically, Agnostic, Atheist, and Unitarian alongside my Christian friends. My only solution was to research everything, but the more I researched the more I realized that each belief was presented as fact. I scratched my head wondering how these contradictions were possible. It just didn’t add up! Unable to determine anything useful from the slew of ideologies I finally settled on Agnosticism. There seemed to be as many ideas as people so to me that meant that no one knew what was going on, and for awhile I was content. 

I spent the next few years with a smug look on my face feeling like I had everything figured out which was ironic because being Agnostic means admitting that you have nothing figured out. It was quite nice not having that over arching feeling of eternal damnation looming over my head every time I did something deemed wrong in the Bible. I was still very much a good person who was nice to others and still got good grades in school. My code of conduct at the time (and still to this day) is to follow the golden rule and it’s worked great so far. 

Around high school graduation I started trending towards Atheism. I had taken a lot of science classes and suddenly the whole world started to make sense. Sure there was a lot we didn’t know, it did not favor one idea over another it simply accepted the one with the most evidence behind it. The whole universe was an ever changing machine with near infinite complexity (complexity is simply ordered chaos and is only seen as complex through human eyes). I saw no heavenly hands tweaking or modifying this machine and further more I saw no reason why those hands were necessary. If the universe needed a creator then why did the creator not need one? I eventually settled on atheism knowing full well that there was no way I could prove my beliefs, but that’s exactly what they were: beliefs.

Until recently my belief in God has not changed

Objects vs. Ideas
Now let me get this out here now: I see no reason why God needs to exist in order for the universe (humanity included) to function properly. Another thing I would like to clear up is the difference between an object and an idea. Most people would agree that God is not an object and would say he lies in another realm or dimension outside our own. There are many objects in existence though: trees, etc… 

I like to think of an idea as a human unit of knowledge. Every single thing you have heard from someone, even an idea of an idea. The whole basis of human language is founded on the ability to spread ideas effectively. 

Now objects themselves do exist

The idea of God definitely exists; this we can all agree on. Is the idea alone enough to justify existence though? Whether God exists or not the idea of God has already changed countless people’s lives. One could go as far as to say that the idea of God has been more effective then God himself.  I believe ideas do exist; the human brain is essentially a container for all our ideas. Our multitude of finely tuned human senses provide the parameters that describe

We can all also agree that no two people (who have existed, some may be extremely similar, but there are always differences as well. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that each person has their own idea of what God is and since ideas do exist within our own minds

The man apparently dumb-founded wanted to know the third wish. . .And so our dinner ended and the man's assistant came out of hiding and asked me is I wanted the Magical Lamp that he spoke of. I responded with my final wish, and still have enough raw Trees for a million Canvas Sails.""

And so the Genii Granted my first wish. . .I then asked the Man

Then the Genii did not know and and so he proceeded to light up a perfectly rolled fatty.

Looking back knowing that the Man was in need I decided to ask him what it is he wanted. The Genii responded, ""I could use some pussy from now and then."" And so the Genii granted my second wish.

Relizing now that this Genii is no man

And so I wished for the Man's Genii to be free.

Realizing that I had let the Man's Genii trick the Man into setting him free I asked him for one quick favor before we go. He responded

Fuck all you assholes that are getting your circle-jerking PHD(g00d)eed off in this subreddit. . .I mean if you are using my experiences to make more munny


The Moral of the Story is that if you want to be a Genii you better learn to start rubbing one off. Rubbing an oil lamp off that is LOL \o/
