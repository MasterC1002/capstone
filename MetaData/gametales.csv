So

This particular event happened while I was just trying out the mage class in the early levels. I was somewhere around level 15 and leveling in Crushbone, and faction).

On this particular day I was having trouble finding a group

Then I had an idea - I remembered that mages had a special spell type called bolt spells. Bolt spells were direct damage spells that had an extremely long range

After some trying I found that there was one very small ledge on the hill that allowed you direct line of sight to the boss mobs just close enough to lob a bolt spell at them. Bored and curious I threw the spell just to see what would happen - my expectation was that they'd rush out of the castle straight toward me and I'd just run to the zone

But Crushbone was infamous for one other thing - absolutely horrible mob pathing. As I waited on the hill watching the castle gate more and more time passed without anything seeming to happen. After some time I assumed that the bosses had been grabbed by some party inside the castle and killed

Now there was another odd thing about mob aggro AI that I wasn't fully aware of at the time. The aggro table of one mob could be overwritten if another more powerful mob of the same faction came by and was attacking a different target

I began to see more and more confused people shouting in the zone asking why a gigantic train of mobs was running erratically around the castle

After a lap or two I began to get somewhat worried as basically the entire zone erupted in confusion and shouts of ""massive train going... somewhere

I sat there inches from the zone ready to book it in a hurry

Another odd thing about the aggro AI for mobs in Everquest was that once their primary target was gone (died

This meant that as soon as I zoned out all of the mobs instantly became aggro to absolutely everyone nearby

There were around 20 people who were sitting at the zone entrance shouting for a group and there had been about 50-60 people in the zone total. Once I finished loading into the adjacent zone I found that about 5 people had managed to zone out with me and I saw nobody else.

I decided to go see the damage

Now had I been less of a dick in my younger years this is where the story would end

As everyone was sorting out the confusion of what the hell happened I played the good Samaritan role

Once the corpses were collected people were amassing just outside the zone waiting for it to be safe. I then climbed back up to trainer hill, and told everyone that the zone entrance was clear.

I just sat at the zone entrance looking very innocent for about 5 minutes while dozens of people came in to start looting their own corpses

Following all that enough people created general reports that a GM appeared in the zone to try and sort out what was going on. Nobody suspected me as far as I could tell since there was such a long delay between me showing up at the entrance and the orc mob busting in

Everyone felt rather safe now that the GM was there

When I zoned back into Crushbone after the horde dissipated I saw that 3 GMs had been brought in to assist

I decided to quit while I was ahead. I have no idea if they ever figured out how it was being done.

Two friends and I were playing DayZ.  We were a short distance from one of the major cities

Then we saw him.  A guy running along the road with 5 or 6 zombies chasing him.  He was just singing some happy song

My friend Tim said ""let's shoot him!""  He was just itching for some action.  Me, we'll make noise and attract all those zombies.  Not to mention, killing him would be a mean thing to do.

Well, but he didn't die.  The zombies started swarming him, and he started yelling ""Who shot me?!  Why did you shoot me!?"".  I told Tim to hit the deck because the singing guy was still alive and shooting at the zombies, and I didn't want him or the zombies to see us.

We wait a minute or two and it gets quiet, but we didn't have any meds to fix broken legs.

We have just succeeded in capturing an orc fortress; our allies lured the main horde out into the field while we snuck in via boat and killed the skeleton garrison. To complete the campaign

It is clear that this is going to be the Big Final Battle

Thanks to our foresight, marshal, and primal, meaning we hardly had any fire or acid abilities.

We did have one advantage; in the previous battle in the fortress, however, and never detonated them. 

As we are preparing to go and face our doom

The DM allows it

Fast forward ten minutes, since only the Warden speaks the orcish tongue (and her bluff skill was in the toilet). The warden marches right up to the war troll (which was a full 5 levels above us, by the way), drops the barrel, and says in giant ""Throw!""

The warden (miraculously) rolls a 16 on the bluff. Sadly, or even the regular orcs.

It was enough to fool the troll. It picked up the barrel and got ready to throw.

Understand, however, realizing that the bluff had failed against the orc commander, immediately triggers stone's endurance (which gives her a massive damage resist bonus), ignites her warhammer, and *hits the explosive barrel that is currently in the troll's hand, right next to her.*

The resulting explosion killed most of the orcs in the area, thanks to her high defenses and damage resist, the Warden took almost no damage (though she was blown back and stunned). 

The fight from there was easy as can be; the troll quickly succumbed to the fire (which prevents it from regenerating). With the soldier's help

1367989402.0,1dwy4d,[D&amp;D 3.5] New gamer's out of the box thinking,JarlesV3,138,15,14,"Alright

The good group has 3 players for the session in question. A rogue who recently came back from the dead, who is brand new to gaming. This was her second session.

The previous session was an RP session that set up the ""good"" group's goals

At the start of the session, the half-ogre barbarian who used to be played by an old player in the group approximately a year ago in game time. Now Sergo was dumb, like really dumb. He had a tendency to get a pet and name it ""kitty"" whether it was a goblin, or a goat. He had an affinity for goats. The other thing about Sergo is, he's really strong, like I should have gone over the character with a finetooth comb at character creation. But if the players can play with him, so can I.

So there's Sergo, calm him, and get him to stop taking the place apart. So the first thing they do is try to talk to him. That just makes him angrier. They roll spot checks, and initiative. Sergo screams about ""kitty"" dying or being taken from him, it's all rather incoherent. The Knight and the Rogue pass their spot checks enough to see the town guards down, but not dead. The Druid sees that there is a goat that is in a bloody pile near Sergo's feet.

Combat begins. The Rogue tries to sneak attack, and gets an attack of opportunity against him as Sergo swings his huge ball and chain (medium creature + Powerful Build + Monkey Grip). He gets thwapped, but continues his charge. Opposing strength rolls. 
The Knight rolls poorly and Sergo can't lose. So the Knight winds up on his ass.

I have a special house rule for my games. Because we all want to have a good time and it is a fantasy game

The Druid was last in the order, rather than magic goats that will go away quickly.

The Knight and the Rogue continue to try to subdue Sergo by choking him out

The next round, succeeds/fails his will save (however you want to look at it) and falls out of his rage, and rushes the druid to give her a great big hug. And then falls down to his back among the goats that are starting to migrate around the town square, crying and laughing, and generally not destroying things.

The best instance of this was a gladiator fight scenario, one of which decides to get a trident, the other who picks up a grappling hook and rope. 

Ranger 1: ""I pick up the trident.""

DM: ""But you aren't proficient with the trident...""

Ranger 1: ""Don't worry about it. I'm basically Poisidon.""

DM:"".... Ranger 2

Ranger 2: ""Bob

DM: ""...Really? Thats not even a weapon...wait

Ranger 2: ""Don't worry about it.""

The DM just looks at him for a minute

We get out into the arena which has several raised platforms and several spiked pits around the rocky floor. We see that our enemies are a small group of orcs. Fighting quickly ensues. 

Both of our rangers had the orcs as favored enemies

Highlights from that fight:

- Ranger 1 started the fight by throwing the trident

DM: ""The orcs spread out before you in the semblence of a military formation. One in front begins banging his shield and sword together

Ranger 1: ""I throw my trident at that one.""

Rolls a nat 20

DM: ""....You throw YOUR ONLY WEAPON

Ranger 1: ""Awesome."" High-fives Ranger 2.

- Ranger 2 kicked one orc into the spike pit

Ranger 2: ""I kick that guy next to the spike pit. I want him to go into the spike pit. What do I have to roll for that?""

DM: ""Well, and we'll see how well you do.""

Dice roll, Orc rolls a 2.

DM: ""....You kick him into the pit. He falls for 15 feet and then is impaled on the spikes below. The orc beside him attempts to grapple you.""

Grapple is successful.

Next Round.

Ranger 2: ""I jump into the spike pit!""

DM: ""...You can't

Ranger 2: ""I pull him with me.""

DM: ""He....he releases the grapple as you try to jump away?""

Ranger 2: ""OH hell no

DM: ""...ok

Ranger 2 beats the grapple check

DM: ""Wow

Ranger 2: ""How tall are the spikes?""

DM: ""Why? Does it matter? They're probably 2.5-3 feet high? People aren't really that thick.""

Ranger 2: ""I roll the orc under me as we're falling. He lands in the same square as the other guy. Do the spikes hit me through both of them?""

DM: ""...I hate you right now.""

- Said Ranger 2 then used the grapple hook from the spike pit with an insanely lucky dice roll to hook another orc and yank him backwards into the pit.

Ranger 2: ""Can I hear people next to the ledge of the pit?""

DM: ""You catch glimpse of orcs' heads

Ranger 2: ""I want to throw my hook and go Orc fishing.""

DM: ""Well you can't see anyone, attack to beat his ac, and percentage to see if the hook sets.""

Ranger 2: ""I got this.""

Proceeds to make the most incredible series of rolls we've ever seen. Rolls the correct square for an orc, 99% to set the hook.

DM: ""I can't believe you actually did that. I..I guess make a STR check to see if you can yank him into the pit?""

Ranger 2 rolls a 18

DM: ""He...the orc screams as he's yanked off his feet and careens into the spike pit. He sails over the growing pile of dead orcs

Ranger 2: ""Don't worry about it.""

- My char is running around crazy

Me: ""What kind of penalty would I get for improvising a simple weapon?""

DM: ""Probably not too bad depending. What are you thinking?""

Me: ""I untie my loin cloth and pick up a rock off the ground. I try to use it as a sling.""

DM: ""....That's gross. And clever. Roll your attack.""

By the end of the fight, and adopted the name of House Orcbane for our group. The motto being ""Don't worry about it."" The emblem was a trident and a grappling hook.

My character is being introduced in medias res to their campaign. We are playing Blood of Heroes (a superhero game) modified to work with a Star Wars setting. 

I’m waiting for a good time to introduce my character to the others while a scene plays out. Two characters, a galaxy wide criminal organization. 

In Blood of Heroes
 
Shawn’s character tries to make an influence roll to get a better price on some previously negotiated deal with this If-you-cross-me-I’ll-have-you-killed mob boss. on 2d10 Shawn rolls a 2. Now the way that Rage is described is that if you ever roll a 2, you go berserk and attack your closest target, friend or foe, with intent to kill. The Smuggler flies into a rage and starts shooting at the mobster. Luckily his attack rolls are just as poor as his influence and he misses every time. 

Tom gets a turn and uses his Jedi’s telekinesis to pick up Shawn’s character and turn him against the wall facing away from the mobster

Shawn disagrees and announces his character will fire blindly backwards over his shoulder and keep trying. The GM relents, if you roll doubles you get to roll again and add the result. Shawn proceeds to roll doubles 3 times in a row to get a 54. The mobster is killed instantly. 

This puts the entire party in jeopardy because we will be marked for death by every criminal and bounty hunter in the galaxy. The rest of the group starts talking about how best to kill Shawn and turn in his corpse

The GM not wanting to derail his own campaign tells Shawn that if he gives up all of his remaining luck points he will change the outcome so that the mobster was only severely wounded and not dead. Shawn gives them up

We ask around the table to see who has any healing abilities. Only one player does. Shawn.

Shawn attempts to give first aid to the mobster. He rolls a 3. Shawn chokes the wounded man to death with a tourniquet. The entire party facepalms.

We set out from town on a mission to discover what has been causing the local livestock to vanish. The quest takes us to a swamp where we find that snakes have exploded in population. We learn the snakes will disappear if we kill the giant snake that attacks the town every now and again. (There is more to the story

The town was located along a lake. With the land forming a small, but 75 feet long. At the same time, lots of smaller snakes appeared and attacked us as well. We separated and started picking off the smaller ones. We were all able to handle ourselves against them.

The more time we wasted on the small stuff, we were all scattered. Also unfortunately, I was the first one on it's path. It took us a while to work out some plan. The plan we settled on was named Everyone-Deal-As-Much-Damage-To-This-Goddamned-Snake-As-You-Can-Before-We-All-Die.

Being my first campaign

I barely scratched it. Don't get me wrong, for turns around the table, us fighting to deal as much damage to this thing as we can and it spinning around in circles trying to kill us. We were at this for about three hours. This creature had an unbelievable amount of health.

We were all beginning to run out of stamina, our human warrior makes a leap of faith off a dock and tried to land on the snake. He failed his roll and was eaten immediately. It was lucky though that the snake was large enough that he was swallowed whole.

Jeff was losing health fast enough that we was likely going to die in the snake. He really liked his character so he was pretty bummed. In a last effort I used my daily feat of strength to tear a 4""x4"" out of a building beside me and hurl it at the snake like a javelin. I succeed my rolls and the wood found it's mark. It just stuck out of the thing's side as it slithered along. My teammates efforts to kill this thing were equally useless.

It slid along past us and we were powerless to stop it. The snake passed by me on it's way out of the bay and it dealt more damage to the freshly swallowed Jeff. One more turn and he would be dead. This was a terrible way to end. Fight this thing for hours only to have the quest be a failure and have one of us die?

I started reading over my character sheet and spell sheet

I paused for a second
""Can- Can I cast enlarge person on Jeff?"" I asked. I gestured to the small figure Jeff picked for himself on the table

My DM and Hunter looked at each other

""Yeah

It was at this point the first crack in the game. Sean, this was too close to a personal issue between them. Tracy responded that even the most dense creature could understand common civility and that it wasn't an unrealistic expectation. Sean took the jab, but he was mad. The group got their supplies and information, and got out of town. 

While advancing through the forest, he took a swing at Tracy's character, got initiative, hit a natural 20, applied the modifier, and knocked out Tracy's character. 

This part is not safe for children..... Sean then proceeded to rape Tracy's unicorn. Any time she, he would knock her out again and returned to abusing the unicorn. He did this repeatedly until he asked, and I will never forget this ""[I]s the damn thing dead? Did I fuck it to death?"" I, as the GM, had to make the various rolls to determine the state of the unicorn. It was not death, although severely wounded both bodily and in spirit. Sean then right back to raping the unicorn and asked to a health/spirit check about every five minutes. 

Tracy sat there seething and unable to respond in kind. After about a half an hour of this, Sean had his character stand over the foully abused animal corpse and shouted ""Fuck you!"", and then cut off it's head. Tracy stood up, said ""Fuck you!"" and departed the house. The game ended... as well as that campaign. Sean glared at the table and simply said ""I hate fucking unicorns."" I don't think he understood the double entendre of his statement given that he was angry with his ex-girlfriend. The rest of us started to laugh. He got mad at our laughter and then left the house as well. Worst ending of any campaign I ever played or GMed. ",Tabletop,True,nsfw,False,t3_1desie

The adventure started in a pretty straightforward way: evil overlord is forming an empire and gradually conquering neighboring kingdoms

Our heroes fare well for a time, and they would soon be overwhelmed. One of the players had acquired an ancient map to a forgotten island several adventures ago and only now pulled it out (to the GM's chagrin), deciding that the best way to save these farmers is to build a fleet and sail to the island. The other players agreed and they set the villagers to work building some small ships while they spent huge sums of gold buying all the supplies they could possibly need on the island and a couple defensive ships to go with it.

After a few weeks in which the enemy forces have been slowly making ground toward the village, with a couple storms hitting them, and unfortunately the loss of one of the refugee boats. 

Arriving at the island, but being reasonable people, they decide to inform the refugees and take the city as the new capital of their island kingdom. Thus begins a new era of prosperity.

Until the evil overlord's fleet arrives.

Okay

A little background - There were four of us on the server and one or two that popped in from time to time. This was our first server that we ran ourselves, a nice little farm set up and a fairly big castle, all on a little horseshoe bay.

Now

After a while I decided I wanted a big project too

About halfway through

We get close to finishing filling it

Me and friend B then start to hatch a plan. Since the server would be backed up before detonation, complex greenhouse friend A had painstakingly built in survival. Now, about an hour in to this, something happens. TNT is placed next to an on lever. Things are bad. There is shouting, lag is crippling the frame rate.

Against all odds we manage to cover the main impact areas of the creeper in water before they can start a server killing chain of events. 

After some time, but everything else was a crater. We are lost for words, nothing but breathing is coming through our headsets. The mutual feeling of 'we-done-fucked-up' is palpable. 

So, everything exactly how it was from memory, and damnit if after 3 hours of fiddly work it looked perfect. The worst part was the greenhouse, that had to be perfect or friend A would notice, it was a bit of a trophy project for him, plus placing glass panes on glass pains is a bitch. 

So with the lever destroyed, we're doing a last sweep of filling in gaps and checking it was all hidden when the unthinkable happened. Out of the corner of my eye I see a TNT flashing. I shout 'no!', and start flying for the line of TNT that connected this section to the rest, but it was too late. Friend B tried too, when he heard my shout, but he too was unsuccessful, the lag got us both. We logged out and waited, we had no time to rebuild again. We could only hope the creeper survived.

After some time we managed to log back in. As the world slowly rendered around us there was only devastation. No trace of the town that once that once stood here was left. No hint of what the bay had looked like either, the creeper thankfully survived.

Knowing we could do nothing
The next day, looking down at the crater where Vagina Town once stood. His head turned towards mine, stared for a while and then the incoming skype call popped up. 

All I got was 'fuck sake' before creative mode was removed and I fell to my death.

I apologised profusely. Friend B was absent for a couple days after that

But that's not the end of it. The creeper still stood. Waiting.

We finished work on it that week

As we prepared to record the explosion, triggering the behemoth we had created. I watched as the others went offline one by one, kicked by the lag. I watched the creeper melt frame by frame into glowing blocks of death. I watched the server die.

We never got that server running again. Whatever happened to it meant that world became unplayable. We took it as a badge of honour

To make the game more interesting, the downside to this was that when he couldn't look out for the base, it was anyone's game.

Soon, had we not escaped, but we did not run back to our base, as the only way back to the base was through the enemies line of sight, weighing our options, we decided that the base must remain hidden, and Albatross was our best option.

The base on Albatross was beautifully designed, and several tall glass windows, it resembled a Cathedral. 

We took refuge in it's basement, whom took a wrong turned and ended up in the basement with us, in which we preceded to kill him, the only thing they had sent him with was food, which was very valuable.

Since their scout did not come back, we knew it was only a matter of time, in the darkness of the basement, there was a chest, in the chest was stacks and stacks of TNT, one thing lead to another and we soon found ourselves taunting the enemies, little did they know we had lined the path with TNT.

We saw them in the distance, and caused them to charge, bang, bang, bang, the TNT had taken out a majority of their group leaving them with only a shadow of what they originally had (I believe it was 20 to our 10) armed with nothing but our hopes, we charged at the enemy, and were easily thrown off the mountain top, in the end

We celebrated in Albatross that night, as it was too much for us to control, we returned to our little base, only this time, armed with the weapons of our fallen enemies.

   One of my friends is a power gamer. No bones about it. He wants that 18 base strength with a +5 Vorpal Greataxe, but that's not important right now. What IS important is that he HATED this character. He didn't roll the stats he wanted, he didn't like the class (Fighter, me thinks? I'm not sure now) he chose, and he couldn't ""get in character"", which for him was trying to figure of how GR1MD4RK his character was and what past atrocities he was atoning for. Also, he tends to play the characters with the messed up past

   What I didn't know was that he arranged with the DM to die in the next adventure so he could reroll while we were finishing up and then meet us during DEUS EX MACHINA or something or other. So as a 4 man, zombies, and get caught in your typical pitfalls, poison dart traps, and the occasional oddity, like spider webs without spiders.

Tiered seating goes down several levels, probably used to appease some dark god or perform some sort of sacrilege. Being experienced players, I roll spot to check around the room. There is a large door at the other end of the room. A thick door

   I was later informed that PowerGamer was supposed to fight said Ogrething, pass go and collect 175 GP. Except that because I was paying attention, I got a surprise round, grudgingly. The ogrething bearing down on PowerGamer rounds the hole, when my readied action takes effect.

Well after a long and brutal campaign, 1 heavy and a support. Because I was an idiot, I mis-equiped them, so only my support class warrior had medkits. This meant that my people could not really be healed reasonably, and only a single guy would actually revive people if someone died. I noticed this only when the mission launched and the previous save was over written. 

So, to the point where each has about 10 ticks of health left. That is until I meet the two giant robots which one shot my support character and one of the assaults. So if you remember, since my support is the only one who had medkits, he could not you know.. heal himself from bleeding out. 

At this point, if you never played Impossible, you might not know that it is notorious for ‘cheating’ with AI getting ridiculous hits, while your people could not hit … well the ground. Ice was not like a regular grunt on Impossible difficulty. He was my heavy hitter. He connected each shot. Every, single, one. Ice shot, and aliens died. 

So while doing humanities work for them

Now at this point, they will die. Since the hit percentages worked out that way, my snipers targeted down one of Ethereals who was controlling my men, and finally put him down. Heavy, with only a few bars of the health left does the only thing he can do, and shoots the rocket into the cluster of enemies. The rocket strays and hits  only two of them. I will confess, at this point I was depressed. My men were out of action points, and everyone is about to die. Not surprisingly

So now it’s Ice, brings down the Uber’s health down a few bars, and then Ice prepares to fire. At that moment, for the first time in the game, Ice misses. He misses both of his shots. The Uber approaches my soldiers, and proceeds to put himself into overwatch. (Fires on anyone if they enter his line of sight)

The volunteer fires two shots into the Uber

Now, somehow the frag grenade skill activated, and Thomas Wood – ‘Ice’ – the man who survived every mission so far threw a frag grenade under his feet. 3 damage. That is all it took to end his own life, and the life of the Uber-Ethereal. 3 damage to end the war for humanities very survival. 
3 damage. I don’t know how I clicked frag grenade. It was what came into my inventory when medkits got replaced in the beginning of the mission. A single frag grenade that Thomas Wood brought with him to the final mission that had ended the war.

Kairon, LE and good at it;
Charatesh
Ash
Cliff
and Elinore

When the game first began, it becomes relevant in a minute.

So they go out and find a ship that they think will do, they pull up alongside, drop gangplank, and board. This fight goes about as well as I intended, even though I underestimated how many push powers my players had at their disposal by a fair margin. Several members of the *Jack's* crew went flying over the side. I had prepared for this and equipped them with the Eberron equivalent of life vests - parachutes - but this just made it all the more hilarious when one of them fails his morale check and decides to just bail, and Elinore pins his 'chute to his back with an arrow as he's jumping over the side.

So they mow through the crew. The captain at the helm uses a magic item to phase through the deck as they reach her, she gets away. Kairon's player was actually excited about this, because he loves recurring villains. The ship is theirs!

So fast forward a few games. There's been a few side quests involving Elinore becoming human

The guy they captured was a platoon commander acting on behalf of the Church of the Silver Flame, so he quickly runs out of cares to give and the interrogation doesn't really go anywhere. So right off the bat, Ash just doesn't know what to do with the guy. The standard battery of questions are just going in circles, because this guy is a religious zealot, so all he does is cite orders from higher up in the church.

I will say this. I've got a really good group of players, is one of the best RPers I've ever had the pleasure of gaming with. Always in character, always supports other players, always knows the rules and the setting. But he was in rare freaking form last night. When it's clear they're not getting anything more out of this guy, and Ash is getting frustrated, Kairon just launches into this speech. It was magical. It was like he prepared it beforehand. ""That was during the war,"" he said. ""And during the war, it would never end

Kairon leaves the matter in Ash's hands: do they kill Serethis or not? Ash decides that they're not going to kill him outright - they're going to get in the ship, which, if you're not familiar with Eberron, is a place that you [Do Not Go To](http://eberron.wikia.com/wiki/The_Mournland). Dropping him there *is* killing him, just slowly.

As they're packing up and transporting their prisoner, making checks to grab onto the ropes before the ship gets too high. Everyone succeeds - except Charatesh, who trips and falls (critical fail).

The players of Elinore and Charatesh have had a sort of running joke for the past few games. The process that turned Elinore human was pieced together from her creator's notes by the group, cries out, ""Dad!"" and makes a roll. It's not a crit, but it's damn close. She wraps the rope around one wrist, kicks off the hull, and swings around to grab Charatesh's hand in true swashbuckler fashion. Everyone starts climbing up the ropes.

At the helm they see a familiar human woman with flaming red hair - the captain of the *Jack* whom they stole the ship from in the first place! She boarded with a new crew while they were distracted with Serethis the Elegant and was taking off with it. The party slaps their feet to the deck, initiative is rolled...

""Parley.""

The whole table stops,* known for his ruthlessness in battle! But he's *also* known for being the most diplomatic person in the party, and everyone at the table - myself included - forgets that sometimes. He's always the first to try to talk when a situation goes bad. But if the talks fail, then, yes, he will *absolutely* slaughter you without a second thought.

The captain,"" she says carefully. ""I'm listening."" She and Kairon begin to negotiate.

And that's when things went terribly

Charatesh's player is a damn fine RPer as well, and this was one of those times. The player hangs his head, just a little, and cries out, ""'Hey, I remember you!' Chaos Bolt."" His character, suddenly remembering that the captain was a Bad Person

Kairon - as you might imagine - takes offense to this. He strides over to Charatesh and smacks him with a push attack

I should point out that the table is in absolute hysterics by now. What's happening in-game is dramatic and all that

The rest of the party, and they're all frozen in a sort of horrified stupor. I think everyone's afraid to do anything. Kairon and Charatesh have a quick exchange concerning manners, but Charatesh insists that the captain is a Bad Person and they need to fight her. His player, on the other hand, knows exactly how bad of an idea this is but he sticks to his character and I love him for it. Unfortunately, so does /u/calabim: Kairon raises his demonic blade and shoves it into Charatesh's face.

That's when Elinore steps in. She leans over the side of the railing and lets an arrow fly,* which wraps around his leg. So here he is again, dangling from the ship. Well, Kairon has just had enough of this guy, and finally just cuts the rope.

Elinore takes a few steps back and does the same attack - to Kairon. She hits and pushes him two squares, Elinore's player, my wife, asks if she can be referred to as The Demonslayer. I was so proud of her.

The captain, recognizing the potential of having these three as allies (they did defeat her once, after all) says, ""Welcome aboard,"" and that's where I called game. It took us a while to finally stop laughing. The two players who lost their characters have already started talking about what they're going to roll up next.

It's about 11 PM, so I know our capabilities.  The mission we load up is not just hard: it's near impossible with only one ship.  We start off in the center of the map, and immediately our Science tells us that all 4 of our bases are about to be under attack.  Knowing that we can't possibly save all four and we need at least one to win the mission, I survey the map and notice that each one is surrounded by a special terrain: the top one is surrounded by asteroids, the left by a scanner-disrupting nebula, the right by a mine field, and the bottom by two black holes.  I immediately order our Helmsman to head down to the base surrounded by two black holes.  Everyone starts yelling at me.  The upper base is closest to being attacked, they finally listen and we're heading down.

Our Science now informs me that the ships we're facing aren't ships you'd expect to be coming in a fleet: they're huge Dreadnoughts with shields too strong for us to seriously fight more than one head-to-head.  Knowing what my Helmsman can do, he listens.  We speed up, but they're still chasing.  I tell him to fly just around the back hole, knowing that the enemy ships aren't too smart: they'll fall right in.  Suddenly everyone understands the plan: we can't seriously fight this many ships, so we just need to lure them into the holes without geting shot down in the process.

We keep this up for half an hour or so, our Helmsman turns up our warp drives and heads right for a black hole.  The problem is, he's gotten a little too used to this.  Instead of circling around and keeping a safe distance, he's trying to do a drive-by on the black hole, flying in a straight line right next to the center.  I keep telling him to turn, to move further away, to circle around the hole.  He won't listen.  It's only after I see that we're seriously turning into the hole, and I threaten to take the controls and fly the ship myself

For those who are not familiar, but you can still find it [here](http://www.europabarbarorum.com/index.html) if you are interested. As it was several years ago, my recollection is not perfect, but this still marks one of my favorite events in gaming.

Onward

I began the game as the ruler of the Baktrians, I was expected to support their agenda in my tiny corner of the world and otherwise keep quiet. I figured I was well placed to take advantage of this by getting in some relatively protected early growth before rising up to achieve freedom for my people.

I poured investment into developing my available technologies and building up a powerful economic base. Every few years or so

After many years of slowly building strength, my cataphracts (essentially medieval knight cavalry before there was such a thing). By the standards of my nearby neighbors, I was practically wielding alien technology from the future. Now all I needed was the perfect time to strike...

My ruler (oppressor!), they were constantly at war defending their territories from the surrounding powers, as well as from raids by lesser groups scattered throughout Asia Minor. Although they were powerful, they were stretched thin, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before they would be too heavily engaged to deal with me.

A few years further into the game, I sent out my elite army to raid and conquer the surrounding cities.

The local garrisons were crushed by my elephants and cataphracts before being ridden down by my light cavalry. In just a few short turns I had lain waste to the countryside and conquered most of the regions adjacent to my ever expanding little empire. Through all of the joy of conquest

Through turn after turn however, no vengeance came. Finally, many turns later, seemingly by accident, one of my scout armies came across a barbarian army at the far eastern border of my territory. It had apparently just emerged from a group of mountains and I assumed that their territory must lie beyond.

Rather than take a chance on them raiding into my territory

These were not backwater bandits

It was just as bad as I had feared. The extreme maneuverability of the horse archers combined with their ranged attacks to quickly wear down even my hardened veteran troops. Wave after wave of screening infantry gave their lives to defend the heavily armored but slow cataphracts. Elephants panicked at the constant damage and fled, with careful maneuver and a final brave charge by the remaining cataphracts, the enemy was pinned and destroyed. The enraged remnants of my army surrounded and slaughtered the barbarians almost to the last man.

Back on the campaign map

The sacrifice of a scout unit revealed my worst fear: each army was essentially a complete copy of the group that had just decimated my forces. Suddenly it dawned on me that an empire as vast and powerful as the Selukids should not have been so desperate for help against mere barbarians. While I was planning their downfall

The remaining turns were short

My wife likes to roleplay. After a while I actually discovered that she’s pretty good at it, and we work around it.

Well, the other player encourages her to “make an action hero move quip. You know, like (best Arnold impression) ‘*Ice to see you!*’” Everyone at the table things this is a great idea, and we all start encouraging her to try. Well, unfortunately, my wife panics, and the best she do is blurt out, but not too much, and couldn’t come up with anything else. It wasn’t a big deal

But then...

That particular D&amp;D game folded, schedule conflicts, and so on. It’s called Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies. Definitely one of my favorite tabletops, but that’s another discussion. What you need to know about it for this story is this: in most respects it’s a pirate-themed fantasy world, only on floating continents and everyone gets around via airship. There are several nations, and one of them has a spy/bodyguard/assassin network known as the Imperial Spiders.

The party is your usual assortment of cutthroats and buccaneers - the drunk helmsman, the explorer from the savage lands, and the fast-talking, always-has-a-connection swindler. My wife joins this game when we pick it back up, and we decided that her way in would be to make her a noble - a princess, to be exact (sidenote: no favoritism here. This is something you can do in this game, if you basically dump *all* your character choices into it, just instead of escorting an NPC who will fling herself into danger at the first sign of it and scream helplessly

So they set sail, they assume that it has some larger, political ramifications that may or may not lead to war. (I don’t correct them at the time. &gt;:D )

The fight ensues. Some of the Spiders are cut down on the deck by sword, which will let them glide back to land, but they’re out of the fight). They keep one alive and start questioning him. Of course, confusion reigns, since they think he’s there for one reason and the Spider is actually there for another, but either way, he isn’t talking. “I would never betray the honor of the Empire. Do your worst!”

“What if we just kill you?” asks someone.

The Spider just smiles. “The reach of the Empire is long and has many arms. Cut one off

My wife/the princess, hauls him to his feet, and says, “*I like pulling the legs off of spiders.*” She slits his throat, sticks a note on him that says “Don’t send any more,” drags him to the side of the ship, and pitches him off like a paper freaking airplane.

I parked the jeep amongst some trees and assumed all was safe. I cooked some meat, from the mists, I see a form moving. Another player! I called out if he was friendly or not. He didn't respond. I hid in a tree, and he responded over text ""yes, friendly!"". I tried to get him to talk more, and that ended up being my mistake. I heard the click of a car door, and the roar of an engine. He took my damn car!

I tried to take some shots at him as he left, hoping to get a better line of sight.

(Repost from a DnD post I made 6 months ago)

It's been a decade

We were playing in a campaign where the DM liked to lord over us with the PCs he and his friends used to play when they were young. They'd show up at bad times

Well, but we were sent by an evil demigod (level 99 npc formerly played by the DM) to meet one of his allies, a level 99 (surprise!) evil cleric. For some reason, possibly because we were ignoring the quest, the evil cleric kidnapped someone we knew, and we had to go rescue her from the cleric. 

The cleric lived on the top floor of a massive tower, and the DM told me they were the personal rooms of the cleric, filled with trophies of fallen rivals, seemingly holy artifacts of rival priests that he had destroyed lining bookshelves. 

I looked at my friend and saw he too was annoyed by the cleric
  
Me: I challenge the cleric to a duel.  
DM: The cleric laughs  
Me: I repeat my challenge.  
DM: The cleric smiles and releases hold person on you.  
Me: I pull out a coin and begin flipping it. I tell the cleric i'm going to kill him and wipe the stupid grin off his face.  
DM: The cleric laughs in disbelief  
Me: How hard is he laughing?  
DM: He's practically in tears.  
Me: I cast trueshot (called shot? forget the spell name
DM: The cleric laughs harder at you.  
Me: I flip the coin into his open mouth
DM: ... Roll it.  
Me: rolls some moderately high number which combined with the +20 allows my shot to hit  
DM: The cleric begins grasping at his throat
DM: Most of the objects in the room glow
Me: What glows the most?  
DM: A wand on the shelves in amongst the holy items glows like the sun.  
Me: I summon a celestial dog.  
DM: umm.. you now have a celestial dog. The cleric is begining to recover
Me: I order the dog to start chewing on the wand and Dan and I teleport out of the tower.  
DM: (Is not happy )  
  
Earlier in the game the DM had made a damaged magic item explode on us. Since he set the precedent
  
DM: From the distance you see the top of the tower explode, you see the remnants of the city smoldering, nothing but foundations remain.   
  
DM: You guys suck.   
  
In the DM's typical fashion, which had a chain reaction on all of the other powerful items. The fact that they were all good items in the heart of the evil city amplified the explosion. The DM wasn't happy. He ended our play session for the day.   
  
Me: Did we kill him?  
DM: Yes.  
Me: How many people were in the city?  
DM: Tens of thousands.  
Dan: How much experience is that?  
Me: Yeah?!  
DM: I'll tell you next time we play. (still not happy)   
  
Next week..  
DM: You both go up a level. Congrats
Us: WTF?! There were a bazillion people PLUS a level 99!

Us: Can we get some sort of reward from a good god for destroying a full city of evil people?

I had been playing a dhamphir (half vampire) traitor that was waiting for the right time to betray the group and had been passing information about them on all game to their vampire lord enemies. Another player had been a human barbarian who had basically become a worshiper of Anubis. In the process

The two met in a large open room, he took some damage, but my character took an ankh blade that absolutely shattered several ribs and cracked a few more. A human would have lost his guts on the swing due to the inhuman strength, but my dhamphir's powerful resilience managed to hold my chest wound closed and the fight continued.

Over the course of the fight, but I knew I couldn't hold out forever. For the first time in the fight, one of us made a bite attack (we had been using claws up until now). Seeing as I was grappled, there wasn't too much room for me to miss. I sank my teeth into his arm and began to feed. An unexpected side effect of the vampiric venom, however, was to force the unlucky warrior out of his were-form, leaving a human attempting to grapple an undead.
He made a strength check at a huge difficulty and ripped his arm free with such force that he lost a chunk of it... but not before taking a fang with it. I was now thoroughly pissed. I didn't even bother turning. I reached behind me, but this next part was absolutely ridiculous.

As I began to feed, with his bare hands, RIPS OPEN MY CHEST CAVITY, shattering what few intact ribs I had left. The shock from the massive damage was so great that I stopped feeding and released my target, at which point he seized the opportunity to reach into my gaping chest and show me my own heart.

As for the party, a womanizing Toreador, and a female Nosferatu (the player did this so she wouldn't be hit on by other players). Needless to say, we were quite the motley crew.

We were introduced to the Prince once we arrived at the city, he *was* a politician. Politicians never get their hands dirty.... they just hire people like me to get their hands dirty for them. 

The meeting went as expected. He was willing to grant us ""protection"" in his grand city

We cleared it out without issue, I had griped about how I didn't like His Majesty's prissy nature, but that was said out of earshot of both him and his goons. Perhaps he had spies following us.... Or perhaps the GM wanted to be an all-knowing dick.

Regardless, not expecting for me to come back. Every time I came back, the Prince prospered because of my survival. I was a trump card that he could have given two shits about. If I didn't come back by sunrise, then he wouldn't have given half a damn. If I did come back though, then that meant I fulfilled the tasks I was given, and because of that, he was the only one to prosper from it (because he sure as hell wasn't awarding me with anything).

This continued on for quite a while, and entrusted us with filling out our new disciplines accordingly.

During our downtime, better than the Prince, that's for sure. 

Well

At this point I had to bring up that even the Anarchs were technically under the protection of the Camarilla as well

We begrudgingly were forced to accept, the Malkavian was rather indifferent, but me and the Nosferatu weren't exactly fond of running errands for the Prince. Me and her began secretly plotting (out of earshot of the GM) that we were going to get in really good with the Anarchs and use them as protection against the Prince.

Unfortunately for us

The GM somehow found out about our plans for defection, while he sent the Malkavian and the Toreador on their own much less dangerous mission. The mission they were sent on was diplomatic mission to gain trust with the Giovanni. As for us, he sent us walking literally into the front doors of a Sabbat stronghold. 

We were almost certain we were going to die in that derelict building. Fortunately for us, skill, and strategy, we managed to wipe out enough of them to clear an escape path, even killing their Archbishop. 

Once we made our escape

Given completely zero options, and we told him that we killed their Archbishop and got the hell out of there.

He didn't seem to hold his grudge against us though, and had started going feral in the middle of the streets. 

At this point

His response? He had his cronies stake both of us before we could even leave the room.

This is where shit starts getting bad. The Toreador and the Malkavian (Whom were waiting for us along with the Prince) were starting to get freaked out

He said ""The only reason I'm even considering sparing a piece of Gangrel trash like you

His cronies pulled the steak out of me and let me go. He gave us our orders to kill the Anarchs, and any other vampire that wasn't a part of the Camarilla. Then he let us go.

The streets were a war-zone. People screaming and shouting, and it was complete and utter chaos. We'd spend the nights fighting, and the days regrouping and planning inside the safety of abandon warehouses. On the fourth night though, the battle had reached its peak. All of the Prince's soldiers were on the streets, and the Prince was sitting pretty in the safety of his tower, all alone. I knew now was my best time to strike.

You see, Protean Level 7 is a Gangrel exclusive discipline that allows the user to transform into a mythical beast of their choosing.

I showed the GM my character sheet, all of the news cameras were put onto me, and I began flying to the top of the Prince's tower, perching atop the peak.

I slammed one of my claws through his balcony window

At this point the GM started freaking out. 

The Prince began screaming for me to put him down, we're on live television! Everyone around the world is watching a dragon perched atop the tallest building in the city! Your Masquerade is dead!""

The Prince still tried to talk me out of killing him by telling me that if I killed him no one would take my side

Then I said one of the best quotes I've ever said in an RPG.

""Anarchs, and they will finally get it. When they see their weak and feeble ""leader"" devoured by ""Gangrel Trash"", they will revolt, and they will call for the Camarilla's blood. The rule of old men who are stuck in the past is over, and now is the time for change, a change that will start with you.""

Before the Prince could even give a retort

After that, it couldn't have possibly ended in a higher note.

TL;DR: The Prince is a bastard, I killed the Masquerade, and you guys should go play Vampire The Masquerade.

Flash back to last game, Geeni, the guy who we have been working with, sent us back to the site of this battle as a portal to Athas had just opened there. The battlefield was a font of elemental chaos, you see, and had collapsed after the death of the elemental dragon.

Ok, and where the dragon once stood was now an undead, ice elemental dragon. The basterd would not give up.

He hasn't seen us yet, but as soon as she get to it, the dragon appears infront of her, as if by some unnatural means. 

Now, even referred to her a such. So seeing her alone facing a dragon we thought we killed was unnerving. We all told her to get out, but she had one action left. Move and she'd provoke and opportunity attack, shift and she'd still be in range. After a moment of ""oh shit"", she realized he was undead and she was a mother fucking cleric. She cast turn undead. Hit. The dragon fled in terror. We all jumped into the portal and avoided a powerful enemy. The cleric felt a power unknown to her. She, our healer, had single handedly, as in the other half of the games namesake.

And who better to playtest than my normal play group?

I got them to go along with my asisine plan, it went well for a while; I got the players wrapped up in a story about political maneuvering where they weren't exactly sure who was manipulating who, but the campaign came to a head when the team was stuck inside a city-- all citizens were barred from entering or leaving.

You see, who had been staying in that particular city, had been assassinated by an unknown assailant.

I did my level best to give the players a good murder mystery; while they had a necromancer who could speak to the deceased prince's spirit, it turned into sort of a Who Shot Mr. Burns? scenario, fraught with red herrings and false leads. After sleuthing and searching for quite a while, they did manage to turn up one ally in the court who seemed of help, and seemed to know what was going on with the assassination. So one of our players, a Knight/Bard agreed to meet with this nobleman in a secret place to discuss this (with the rest of the team hiding out of sight nearby).

Naturally, in a hushed tone, to our Bard:

&gt;""I believe I know who the assassin was-- in fact

&gt;""Really? Who was it?""

&gt;""Me.""

When the nobleman started casting a spell on our hapless bard, because one of the players, a samurai, stepped forward and sheathed his sword.

&gt;""I walk up to him, 'I mean you no harm-- I simply wish to know why you have done this.'""

&gt;""Uh... [ahem] 'Why? Because the prince was an impetuous lout-- he would've brought this country to ruin with his harebrained schemes had I not intervened.'""

&gt;""'You have a bodyguard... are there any more of you?'""

&gt;""'Yes, but powerful. We're dedicated to building up the world anew-- by tearing out the corruption plaguing it completely.'""

&gt;""Okay

&gt;""...wait

The samurai reasoned that not only does he have no quarrel with this nobleman and no affiliation or allegiance to this country's ruling class,* I figured, *it wouldn't be the first time one of us goes turncoat-- I've certainly done it enough-- this can probably slide.* The anarchists were designed to be the villains of the campaign, but having one of the players join them might make it more poignant for the rest, after all.

What got me was when the entire team decided this was sound reasoning and offered to join up with the anarchists and destroy the government.

When that happened, and solemnly decree:

I descended down the stairs to now scattered Germans like I was goddamn Death incarnate and shot another guy.  At this point my SMG was out so I switched to my pistol.

1367530983.0,1dku2l,[WoW] The slaying of Aran,lokigodofchaos,68,10,9,"Back in the Burning Crusade days of Warcraft. My college roommate and I belonged to a small casual guild with aspirations of raiding. Karazhan was the perfect fit, then called it a night due to it being late. The next raid night we spent a couple hours dying repeatedly

A little background on the fight. Aran stands in the middle of his library. As soon as you engage him the doors lock and nobody can get in or out. He has a bunch of minor attacks that use up his mana and can be interrupted. When his mana is low he turns everyone into sheep who cannot attack or move and drinks to recover it. When his health gets to a certain point

Sensing morale would be an issue, and then the guild leader declared “Get some rest, he’s going down tomorrow.”  The next night, knowing morale had been strained the week before, we made an effort to keep things light-hearted between attempts. A few of us had brought Savory Deviate Delights, an item that transforms whoever uses it into either a pirate or a ninja. After the first wipe we passed out delights and attempted to do an all ninja attack. It almost worked, we had him at less than 10% health, gather in the doorway to the library (someone had gotten locked out the week before)  and rebuff. It was decided we should be pirates this time. 
My roommate, which had the wireless router in it.

So our group is buffed up in the doorway, I see his character run straight at Aran. Our guild leader yells over the microphone for the tank to move in. We frantically get into position and begin the fight.  My roommate had run through Aran into the back wall, but I see him turn around and start casting.  

Adrenaline is rushing as we burn the mage down.  We manage to avoid his attacks, and the last one dies just in time for Aran to turn us all into sheep. He taunts us, drinks his mana up to full then begins combat again.  The most difficult parts of the fight over, we can concentrate on keeping our damage rotations going and getting out of the way of his blizzards and explosions. We have him at 5%. This is the farthest we’ve ever been. It looks like we are going to make it. I get the spell where I can’t move, so I freeze in place. 2% health and I can move again. He won’t be able to cast that spell again for at least a minute.  Aran shouts out “The nightmare is over” and my speakers erupt with cheers.

Once that dies down

This is the tale of our first session recounted as best as i can remember. This is going to be a massively long read

Setting: 

All involved characters grew up learning about legend of the great war. The war waged for eons against the four elemental primordials (earth, fire) until the Gods sent down four angels, who then sacrificed themselves to contain the primordials. The rebuilding period that followed lead to competition between city states and massive, sprawling cities developing in previously sparse areas.

Arrival:

Each of our characters arrive at different times in a quaint district. We each do our introductory turns


Isaramin, succeeds in peeling 97%, then growls as she's leaving which makes the figure angry, and her new mace dissipates into thin air.

Davneiros

Throzgar, and becomes instant friends with the 9' giant bouncer. He gains audience with the Matron, and inquires about what he can get for 20 gold. The Matron looks carefully at him, and replies with ""More than you can handle"". Throzgar confidently assures her that ""I can handle it"". DM: 'Roll for endurance'. 


He rolled a 19


Dusk, and begins demanding information rather brashly. The giant bouncer informs him that he should leave, but being a hot headed shade, he rolls for initiative instead. 4. Giant knocks him out, throws him in the street in front of the inn, and his turn is over before it even really began.

Tabu,securing 4/5, but then later fails a charisma check and calls the brothel matron a bitch, which leads to him being banned from every establishment in the town. He kicks the unconscious body in the street on his way out.

My character is a half elf wizard named spetrovi. He meets the inn's barkeep for information about a strong ale he had heard of, and that he should seek a better teacher elsewhere. He leaves to seek out some strong alcohol.

Nagad olimpius, and he fails every check to avoid losing half of his 100 gold wallet.

Bengal Hairybasements is the flaming (in two ways) human swordmage. He too visits the alchemist, he was betting on his athletics check to get out of the situation, but critical failed and essentially knocked himself out and was raped by the goblin, thus contracting a goblin strain of herpes in his first turn.

So in summary, isaramin peeled 7000 carrots in return for what was now a pile of dust (and the carrots were eaten by a runaway horse), davneiros had a +2 to ac thanks to his new shield, throzgar now owned a brothel and was a sex icon, dusk had been knocked unconscious and made a fool of himself, spetrovi had gotten intoxicated, Nagad had lost half his money

it goes down: 

At the end of the day, shouting about an attack on a nearby town. The entire group agrees to accompany him, minus spetrovi, who prefers not to make alliances so quickly, and instead follows behind at a distance.

We just had what I think was the single most amazing D&amp;D game I've ever had.

I laughed so hard I could barely breathe.

In another moment, my breath ragged.

We witnessed a scene that tore me with uncertainty between screaming in rage

We were overwhelmed

And at the end of the session, we three the heroes in a way few D&amp;D heroes can truly be.

We rescued hundreds of tortured, private army that was specifically prepared for attack. The exodus drew the attention of the city's full army of two thousand, which marched against us.

We got the slaves away, and routed the army.

All without a single casualty. We neither killed

And we won.
    
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
My DM is... sort of a dick. He can be mind numbingly brutal, but still *our people*... we knew we didn't ""arrive at the speed of plot."" We knew they were dying. We knew their numbers would decrease every day, and with the city about to go to war...

We knew what we ""should"" do. We ""should"" play the politics, my character, the leader of the rebellion to free all magic users from slavery, was at the moment, confined in a prison, in solitary confinement, about to be tried and possibly executed. Fortunately

We ""should have"" written them off as casualties

And that's what the DM was expecting.

Instead... 

Instead we stood up and said

The red dragon disciple monk/sorcerer (houserules + monk = awesome) ran in, her fists disabling the guards without so much as a drop of blood. She guided her people, and led them, guarded them.

The druid flew high above the complex, taking advantage of his sight, by use of a charmed horse stolen from the stables.

And me... I had our allies, and we knew our actions were taking place nearly in real time, I sweated as I gave orders, got information, struggled to make plans.

One ally forged walls of stone to stall the army. Another wove mind magics over what few guards spotted the fleeing people. And illusions were cast over the lot of them. None of the guards ""saw"" the people fleeing. All they knew is that they were ""under attack"" by magic users

And really

The druid then did the most dangerous thing of all... he charged the army itself. He was already a flying pincushion, he charged the army.

Because the monk needed more time. The freed slaves were too weak to even run.

The leader of this division... the one in charge of the front lines, personally guarding my cell with a special weapon that can destroy magic users in a single strike (they really don't trust supremely powerful leaders of a magical rebellion. I wonder why :P), she raised her weapon against him.

She, of my dreams. She, who I'd been convinced was a good person. She, who I'd decided to trust, and give a play by play of what we'd been doing just now, giving her information enough to ensure my execution, and kill both the other PCs, should she choose.

As she charged up to the druid on her winged horse

She glanced down at her army: distracted, ""A shame I couldn't catch you, but it seems I have to take care of my men, don't I?""

He thanked her, but only she had the authority... and so he lost himself in the alleyways.

And the army, under construction by the military, for use in the coming war. 

Magic is an evil and terrible thing... unless you're going to war. Politics

And also secret. How would the population react to knowing they were using *magic* in the war?

It was the safest place we could put them. And come the war... we will have over a hundred loyal spellcasters

1368459785.0,1e8zeb,[Shadowrun] In which shit hits the fan...,amightyrobot,66,13,4,"Last week I posted a [story about our Shadowrun game so far](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1djmu6/our_heist_is_on_the_verge_of_becoming_a_stickup/)

You ready? We good? OK.

So Hammer and I close the door behind our dead guard - now we've got a situation. I briefly consider finding a way to carry the corpse back up the 14-story ladder to the roof

The only other exit from the maintenance closet is a staircase leading down to the boiler room and sub-basement

I pull my cyber-eye out of its socket and let it roll to the bottom of the steps so I can get a view of the next room.

The boiler room is empty except for two guards posted by the door on the far side. Beyond that door is the sub-basement that we know the safe is in. From where my eye is lying I can see the elevator

I grimace - we might have to get through them eventually

Of course it's right about then that he does. The doorknob turns

""Shhh. Sleep now, as my other eye confirms, and I breathe a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, as well as his greasy son. They watch people spend lots of money, and waitresses take large baskets loaded with credsticks and head for the elevator.

Only one problem there - with my eye in place

Sweet talking a particularly stupid waitress, and Hammer and I head back up to the roof, to regroup with Coltrane and find another way.

Clearly the front door isn't an option, but not our hackers, and there's a roof access door, but it's locked. Just our luck, then, that after a few minutes the door opens and a single, dwarf guard walks out.

We hide

I'm halfway across the roof before my friends have a chance to stop me. I steal up behind him like a shadow

He's framed in midair for a moment

""Smoking kills

We head through the now-open roof access door and immediately start looking for a place to hide - we can already hear police sirens

Around this time, and this score is supposed to be his way out of the family business. And now *he's* on his way down, to ""clean up this mess."" Then the line is dead, and when Fury calls back, there's no answer.

This is a bit of a game change, now if things really go south, we've got an ace in the hole. With no loyalty to Caravaggio the elder or younger, we're free to sell either out to the other if we have to. With all this new shit in mind, I climb down the vent system to the basement.

The room the money's being held in is pretty small. A wooden table just below my vent is overflowing with credsticks - it's hard to count how much is there - and on he other side of the room is the elevator door. Between them, we'd be home-free... and we just happen to have arranged for one.

After a run-in with some young street thugs earlier in the week

And goes, and he's getting the hell out of town. He doesn't know we're tracking his commlink, but we'll deal with that later. Right now, we need a new diversion.

Fury has the right idea: Under the table he's sitting at, drops the thing and walks away casually.

I can hear the bang from my position on the floor below, can feel the building shake beneath them. But the mooks aren't moving for the elevator. They look apprehensive, but only knot up tighter around the money on the table. 

So I don't have my distraction, throw himself on it to protect his boss's investment, and while he's dying and the rest are distracted, I'll swing down and shoot a few in the back before they know what's going on.

But of course all of them fail their perception checks, leaving the wooden table in splinters and killing four of the thugs instantly. I drop out of the vent with my shotgun ready, pumping two barrels of razor-sharp flechettes into the two mobsters nearest me. The other two are still drawing their guns when the elevator door opens and Coltrane, ever punctual, calmly places a bullet from his revolver in each of their heads.

Our victory is short-lived, take a long pull, and offer it to my accomplice. Lighting a cigarette, I let out a long plume of smoke.

The team is assembled by a mysterious woman who calls herself Orange. She introduces us to ""Mr. Johnson, and lots of high rollers in attendance, which means a safe full of loot by the end of the night.

The team consists of Mule, a high-tech Elven drug dealer (and Fury's Bliss supplier); Hammer, a human hacker who worships the Norse pantheon; Grimm, a Cajun Orc shaman; and Dom, a dim-witted Troll day-laborer-turned-Adept.

We check into our hotel across the street from the big event a few days in advance

Obviously, and three different excursions to the mob-controlled building result in seven or eight dead mooks. I do a hasty, vague frame-up job on the Yakuza (cutting off the dead men's pinkies and carving Kanji characters on their foreheads), but obviously there's going to be increased security for the gala.

The team manages to KO the mob security chief (he's staying in our hotel) and find detailed blueprints and tactical plans in his hotel room. Of course

So things aren't ideal, along with a facechanging mage NPC who's proven very useful so far. Meanwhile, Grimm levitates Coltrane, Hammer and I onto the roof of the building.

Thanks to our previous excursions, and a staircase down to the boiler room. In the boiler room is the safe, a few guards, and two automated turret guns (previously hacked by our team). The idea is, our buddies inside the party let us know when enough credsticks have moved to the safe, I get the two techies down to the boiler room by any means necessary, they hack the (old &amp; outdated) safe, right? Hell

Right.

So I creep down the ladder to see if the coast is clear, facing out. Hammer creeps down behind me and hacks one guy's comm, forging a message telling him to get his ass around front pronto. Meanwhile, I crouch in the corner behind them, silenced SMG pointed at their backs just in case. Mook #1 gets the message and tears ass around the side of the building. It's working.

But, and as much as I like roleplaying, I get a little iffy about it when more than four or five people are playing. So I said to him, ""Okay, I'll join, but on one condition:

You let me play as Samurai Jack.""

For some baffling reason

Now, who takes over the world and turns it into a dystopia, and Jack spends most of the series trying to get back to his own time and stop Aku, while being a complete badass.

The DM asked me to justify Jack being in this particular setting, and is still looking for a way to return home. Simple enough.

For the most part

We ended up coming to the chamber where the artificer was lying in wait for us, gnomish figure standing in the middle of the chamber before you; his skin is jet black, with hair of almost fiery red. He calls out to you, shouting, 'So! Someone has finally bested the machinations of Ahkoo--'""

At which point, and draws his sword. Combat begins.

Now, at all, and is doing his very best to kill the perceived Aku. The rest of the party has joined in on the fight, and it becomes an epic showdown, with Ahkoo using his technology to fight, relying on his rocket boots in particular to stay out of the range of the melee characters for most of the battle.

In a last-ditch effort to deal some real damage to Ahkoo, onto the shoulders of the party barbarian, who our sorcerer had cast Fly on. A second leap off of the barbarian, and Jack attempts to deliver an attack in midair, again shouting, ""AAAAKUUUUUUU!""

""Okay

Nat 20.

""Uh... confirm the crit...""

Everyone gathers around to watch the Roll of Destiny.

Nat. Fucking. 20.

The DM reaches into a bag of dice, saying, ""Okay... roll this instead of damage, just for fun."" The die, as it turns out, has listed body parts instead of numbers, and I rolled ""left leg.""

The DM ruled that Jack had cut straight through Ahkoo's leg as he tried to dodge the strike

I've no recollection as to where he lost his legs. Perhaps they walked off. Huehue. (Sorry.)

So, but I felt that it would be more proper to try and get him killed. Etur, of course, didn't warm up to this idea and slowly became a legendary biter. Goblins and kobolds and elves fell to his teeth, shearing fingers, eyes and legs with equal abandon.

If a dwarf could have their teeth put on the artifact list, but it is apparently fulfilling.

This is the tale of my resilient companion in masterwork dwarf fortress adventure mode. For simplicity lets call him Jake. 


I was playing my first ever successful adventure mode as a human vampire. I made the mistake of hiring a human axe guard

This proved tougher than I expected. I lead him to bandit camps he slaughters them. Drakes? Slays them. Perilous rivers? He fords them. He even slayed a minotaur while one of his legs was broken!

Still frustrated from my failures, attempted to shoot me with a javelin launcher. I dodged somehow. Then I see the text I had been waiting for. Jake had been standing behind me and the javelin had pierced his helmet and lodged in his outer brain. I knew he was a goner. No one could survive that! But the rng had other plans. I finish off the leader only to be greated with the shock of my life. Jake simply removed the steel javelin and droppes it at my feet. I am still convinced that he has no hope for survival so I make my way back up to the surface. Jake follows, in pain passing out repeatedly but doggedly holding on to life. I actually feel sorry for him. 

Now on the surface

I awoke a few hours later to find Jake. Still alive! Battered and bruised but somehow not dead. It was at that moment I realized that this npc was unkillable. How I don't know

To this day I have yet to die and neither has Jake. So my goal is to rid this world of evil with my companion. If I can only figure out how to reach the circus...

The gametype was relic

I played Necrons. I was short on models that day, and an elite squad made up of an Overlord (my general); 5 Crypteks (techno-mage, kinda); and a single lord (baby overlord). These were my heavy hitters, my A-Team.

My opponent was the Imperial Guard. He brought overwhelming numbers, and most importantly 3 tanks. I could tell at a single glance I would lose this, I was outnumbered 3 to 1. This didn't matter I thought, screw the relic and screw winning. If I can just destroy those tanks before I get wiped out, I'll count this a victory.

We fought hard, but the Cryptek who killed the tank and the Lord both managed to pull themselves to their feet, the powerful Necrons healing instantly, their living metal skin flowing back into shape.

They charged the second main battle tank, an APC, disgorged it's contents. An entire squad of guardsmen, 20 angry scared and well armed men.

The Lord and the Cryptek looked around them. 20 men on the roof of the nearby building, and charged at the APC.

The Cryptek got off one last shot, taking shot after shot. In total 70 laser blasts, 19 armor piercing bullets, and 5 plasma blasts were fired at him. 56 hit. None brought this mighty champion down. His armored body held against blast after blast, cratered and pockmarked, as he staggered towards the APC. He was determined to take this last tank down with him, and fulfill his dead overlord's true objective. The enemy grew desperate, launching a missile, allowing the beam of pure heat energy to pass harmlessly through him. He was unstoppable.

The lord reached the tank and raised his warscythe, the warscythe crunching through into the inner workings of the vehicle and striking the fuel tank in two. The tank exploded with a deafening blast, peppering the Lord and the nearby guardsmen with shrapnel. One piece from the explosion struck the lord in a weak spot of his brutalized armor and impaled him. He fell on that battlefield a hero, withstanding a literal army to complete the job he was sent to do. I never attempted his resurrection roll, it didn't seem right.

After the Lord fell my defeat was certain, Leonidas, and a [bright red crest](http://i.imgur.com/KndsHFl.jpg) as recognition for his prowess. He'll always be my first pick for a frontline lord in future.

**Backstory** *- skip if you don't care*

For 70 years the world was locked in perpetual war.  A generation long World War that touched every nation on Earth and left many in ashes and ruin.  Those that were lucky enough to possess the technology were able to shoot down the nuclear warheads that were launched.  For those nations that could not, it is the way of the world, but something must be done to spare the populace.

The Robot Wars were born.

Conflicts between nations are now decided by a contest blending the best technology and men each nation can provide.  Individual battles take place at the behest of two nations vying for the same resources

In addition to this there is also The Tournament, and is therefore heavily contested by all nations.

**Now to the actual story**

There were 5 players to the game, a support crew and a promoter.  Most players chose to play the pilots, but not all.

One pilot in particular fought for the Japanese, but just the character.  He was cocky, sarcastic, and talked down to anyone he thought was inferior to him; which was basically everyone.

Another character that was played was the mechanic/tech support for the Canadian team.  This character was a literal genius programmer and also the foremost hacker in the world.

The setting is the quarterfinal party

The Japanese pilot is being his usual dick self at the party, is the Canadian mechanic.  His team was knocked out in the second round by the Japanese so he's already mad at them.  Added to that is the fact that the mechanic has just learned that the Japanese pilot is utilizing a Neural Interface that's been permanently implanted in his brain.  This allows him to control his mech by thought, and is also a technology expressly forbidden by the rules of The Tournament.

The Canadian player knows he can easily get the Japanese disqualified with this information, is that the Japanese's neural interface only controlled the weapons system on their mech.

The rest of the session went like this:

Random party guest: 'This is a nice party

Japanese pilot: 'Yeah right


At which point two ballistic missiles are fired off the shoulder pack of the Japanese mech outside the mansion

Everyone dies, sending rubble tumbling down from the sky, there is also a lake of molten fire running to every point inside the mansion.

1368694706.0,1efw5v,[EVE Online] Thievery and Torpedo's - A story about a stolen freighter and a destroyed carrier,NoxiousPluK,67,17,12,"This story happened at the end of January 2012.

We were a medium sized corporation living in 'wormhole space'.

Wormhole space is something special in EVE.
Where normal solar systems are connected by stargates; wormhole space is not.
It is (obviously) connected by wormholes.

Wormholes spawn at a random location
Next to that
At the end of their timer or when the maximum mass is reached

Now wormhole space solar systems have next to the random spawning wormholes also one or more 'static wormholes'.
Static wormholes allways lead to the same class destination

Wormhole space classes in general scale from C1 to C6 in size

We lived in a C5 wormhole
Getting ships, harvested minerals and gasses and other stuff out was a time consuming and tendentious task.
We would need someone to probe down our static wormhole (and possible other random holes that connected from our space into others, check if the other side was safe for traveling trough and continue probing there if it was, until we had a route to 'normal space' and we could fly in and out our stuff.

Recently I checked my old mails on one of my EVE Online accounts from that time

So
Now in 'normal space' in EVE

The security level of a system tells you how much NPC police (CONCORD and regional navy) involvement there is.
There is 'highsec' space (0.5 - 1.0)

After wormhole space, fight over system control and protect their precious resources.
To get an idea
The rest is either nullsec owned by NPC's

Now this nullsec space we connected to was owned by SOLAR WING. A quite big Russian alliance, depending on location - I believe Russia has multiple timezones) and there was only one other player in the system.

We scouted the system and found an online control tower (a player build structure that acts as a base - [example image of another tower here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11684856/EVE/c5/pos0001.PNG)).
Inside this tower were 3 things that catched our interest. A Russian player that, but seemed fairly new. A Nidhoggur, wich is a carrier class ship of the Minmatar race and a Charon, wich is a freighter of the Caldari race.

We decided to play around with him a bit. The control tower seemed to have no defences at all so we decloaked a stealth bomber and flew at high speed into the forcefield

Offcourse this did not work for a number of reasons. The stealth bomber was much to small

The player inside the forcefield on the other hand got scared. He must have had the idea that we had the rights to enter his forcefield

This had a couple of results. He was bumped out

After some discussion we decided to probe down the Charon and steal it. I was the only capable Charon pilot back then

He kept flying behind it until it came to an almost stop. I warped to him, jumped in and stored it in our starbase. First 900m ISK (the price of freighers back then, now they are around 1.4b) in the pocket.

Next we had the Nidhoggur. What to do with it?
We had no pilot able to fly the thing (one of our members was one week off) and leaving it here someone could find and board it or the Russians could come and recover it. We decided to destroy it and take the loot that it would drop.

With a bunch of random ships we [destroyed the Nidhoggur](http://zkillboard.com/detail/-310185/) and stole the loot wich had a total value of around 250m ISK

On our trip back to our wormhole

Now this was nice, you could not tell if there was someone in it or not. It gave us bragging rights for months towards the rest of the alliance / corporation.

A year later we happened to join a rivaling Russian alliance

We never heard about this incident again

As allways in EVE

1374381781.0,1iqhoz,Another tale of love and conquest from the Age of Empires HD Edition,Him_mortal,53,8,2,"Good evening my friends

The setting: Dark Ages. A brutal time of pestilence
The land: Black Forest. A twisted hellish maze of trees and roots
The players: Me(Celts)
The enemies: Purple(Koreans)

The game started as any other, used to battle. But it had taken its toll on us. We were weary and sought peace from out neighbors to the North and West. And for time, peace was had. Crops flourished, lumber was felled, and a small town grew. 

The Feudal age came, and further South, the Britons. The British were a fidgety bunch, unwilling to share their land with the Mongols and I. The audacity of their King, he walled off his lands and locked his gates. If war ever came, I knew we could not count on their help. He was a peacock, content to build his walls and pray for the best. This is a harsh land

The Castle age came quickly. The alliance with my Mongol neighbors flourished, the pride of my nobility. My siege was quite powerful and I constructed several workshops as a safeguard against encroachment from my Northern Korean neighbors. I noticed that the Mongol Horde was also on the move, scouting the forests and running into several impressive fortifications. The British however kept building walls, thinking that would protect them from the onslaught of Hunnish Cavalry and Frankish Siege rams.

I knew conflict was coming. My scouts disappeared. I stockpiled food

The Imperial age finally arrived, Tartans and Horse Archers poured into the city. The sacking was violent, brutal and final. Before the Mongols could even mobilize, the British refugees streamed into Mongolia and sought safety. The Southern city was lost, and the Southern flank was compromised. The Mongols mobilized, and somehow stabilized the frontier.

It was time to take this war North, that if destroyed provided a back door into the Korean City. I moved my troops to the Northern frontier, blasted a hole in the woods with Siege Onagers, and streamed 100 brave Paladins into the Korean City. The fight was brutal. 

In the South, well they farmed and walled in a small refugee camp between my land and the Mongolian city.

My troops poured through the breach. Paladins, Halberdiers by the hundreds. The pressure was now on the Koreans, and his defensive wall could not stop me if I did not attack it from the front. I moved my peasants in to the rear of his base to construct more stables and barracks. The Franks came to his aid with heavy horse and infantry, but my troops cut them to shreds. An uneasy stalemate was reached. Gold supplies were dwindling on both sides, and cheap garbage troops were being fed into the meat grinder. Every trebuchet and Paladin was protected from harm. An hour or a decade passed with no movement on either side. Every inch of land was won and lost with battalions of skirmishers and halberdiers.

I feared this war would drag on forever, my people losing respect for their kings. I feared the worst. 

I dispatched halberdiers and paladins south to defeat the Frankish army. With the help of the Mongols

With renewed vigor, my Woad raiders killed their villagers, my halberdiers protected my siege while I laid waste to their castles and town centers. Finally my rams destroyed their defensive walls and cannon towers. The Korean city was burnt to ashes. I claimed their land and relics, fortified the ruins of the city, and rebuilt my army yet again. The Korean leader, Kim Jong Ill, well him

Just as I felt a positive upsurge in our war, and again the gold flowed. 

I sent another message to the Mongols. ""Attack through the middle
And so we did...

Line upon line of camel and siege ram rolled through the wooded corridors, fierce warriors without fear. Walls were crumbled, charges of heavy horse broke upon our spears, and infantry fells by blasted from siege and arrow. After an hour or year of fierce hot fighting, the Frankish capital laid in ruins.He retreated South, to his last safe bastion, the former lands of the British. 

The war was well in hand. But what of the Huns? We'd soon find out. In mere moments after our victory over the Franks, horse archers, and siege battered our gates and castles. Luckily our military base had been set up and fortified in the earlier battle, and out of the barracks poured pikeman and halberdiers, and from siege workshops beefed up siege onagers, with more stamina and speed than anything on the battlefield. 300 horse died that day, and another 500 infantry, our ragtag band of men stood victorious. 

The battle raged for yet more years. My armies pushed hard and fast from the South. Highly mobile raiders and siege pummeled the Hunnish capital, I think their people had all but accepted defeated. I ordered my men to burn all the farms and homes so none of their people could grow food there again and to scout the woods for resistance and rebels. We did find a small unprotected base in the woods. It fell quickly and all were put to the sword.

All that remained was a small Frankish and Hunnish army in the lands of the British. Devoid of shelter, ""Go South, you will find the last of the Franks and Huns. They who would kill our allies, the Mongols. They who would burn your farms and slaughter your serfs. They who would take your women. They showed you no mercy. They killed your sons and brothers and fathers. Entire generations of Celts fell upon their swords. I SAY UNTO YOU, RIDE THEM DOWN LIKE THE BRUTES THEY ARE. KILL THEM ALL."" ...And into the breach my men rode, and they destroyed everything the came upon. The war was over. My people were safe. The Mongolians, our allies were safe as well. That is

It was a lazy Saturday and no one was really doing anything on the server among their normal buisness (police officers patrolling the city, a position that only admins and super moderators were able to bestow upon players and themselves, they started out with Flashbangs, a P90 and a Pump Action Shotgun, courtesy of Counter Strike Source) and thus, it was done.

TRG always spawned in the garage in one of the skyscrapers, we were ants compared to their power, bullets would only get us so far against people who could spawn in helicopters and vehicles without having to pay, part of the fun of RP was getting a job and earning money, if you earned enough you could buy a car, but helicopters were only for admins and even they couldn't spawn them naturally.

They could also find where we were, he had modified his HP and we managed to get away, but the group was split up, some ran to the power plant and some ran to the house, me included.

When we arrived at the house we found a Scout Sniper Rifle, from this point on, he led the pack, from the house, we began searching for the members that weren't able to make it to the house, unknown to us however, we were followed.

We searched alone, in the process of searching for other members we lost 2 of them..and then another, right infront of us, one of our members was killed, no shit!, the admin was invisible! (to clarify, there was 6 in my group and 4 that went to the power plant) one of our members shot the admin with his Shotgun, although the admin was invisible, his cloak was taken off and his dead body revealed

Many questions arose from the group, we weren't killed but we were wounded by some sort of explosion. the others, hearing the explosion, rushed to our aid and shot in every direction, we didn't know what we were shooting at but it did by us enough time to get into a KFC store, we boarded up the entrances and hid behind the counter.

A floating bomb no clipped its way inside the KFC (in reality it was being held by an admin) and was set and dropped before we could kill the admin, and 2 others from the group that got split up, leaving only 2 surviving members, one turned on the other as he was seen as an obstacle because he was wounded and the last surviver tried to make an escape, but was shot down.

They arrive in a city that's run by Githerzai monks. They do find some scrolls, the gnomes offer 2,500 for both a Raise Dead ritual and an Open Portal ritual. The party is about to seal the deal, but then the Genasi Swordmage offers 10,000. The gnomes accept the offer, but the party says NO. The gnomes refuse to accept any offer other than the Swordmage's, and the party decides to use the Swordmage's money instead of splitting it like usual. This causes the Swordmage to become angry, so close to redemption) and throws them into the sewer. His character storms off, and is attacked by his friend in an instant. It was a no-contest, which they worked hard to get back

The survivors begin asking around town where they could find more scrolls, if not the, most powerful types of Dragons in 4th Edition. They can dominate and daze you at-will and as a minor action. They arrive to the lair and attempt to diplomacise with the dragon. It is all going well until the warlock, who is played by a guy we all know is OMEGA AS FUCK and a notorious pervert, decides to open his mouth and offer to perform fellatio and a prostate massage on the dragon. Here's the deal: I have a special rule that visual shit like that is banned from the table. It makes the players very uncomfortable, is highly unfunny, and ruins the mood of the campaign. Innuendo, and even brothel visits are allowed

The solo adventure starts off with my old tiefling warlock (I pretty much lead a Coup on this campaign, wasn't very good) showed up with an army of devils to assist the Warden. After he was ascended to the heavens by a succubi and several devil legionnaires, he was able to finish the dragon. The Warden think's he's in the clear, but not so. My Warlock is on a quest to rebuild the ancient tiefling empire, and came to the lair to collect not only funds, but magic items, including rituals. He makes a deal with the Warden: if the Warden kills the corrupt king of a country that is close to the tiefling's newly conquered land, excluding the cleric, as the king was hated by even his bodyguards and was often seen outside in his courtyard, until one of them crit him six times in a row.

My ship held its own

At long last, one *anything* to vanquish the behemoth and claim victory for the Federation. Just as my pegasus missile was about to fire, disaster struck. The enemy super-strike took out my weapon systems, killing the crew member responsible for repairing them. 

Things quickly got worse; the enemy's supershield soon came back online. I had no weapons

Artyom disagreed. The enemy mothership's automated systems suddenly repaired its missile bay; it was all the opening Artyom needed. He began visciously attacking the missile controls

""ARTYOM, I'm not making that up. Artyom and I had been through a lot together).

Artyom didn't listen. He was trapped inside the supershield with no hope of escape, defiant act, he tore apart the missile targeting system, finally executing the limping mothership. The ship exploded in a brilliant burst, a tragic but fitting end to the greatest crew member I have ever known.

Here I stand, I had to push aside the bookshelf and inspect the inlaid brick, noticing instantly the not-so-subtle lines that divided the wall from the hidden door. We would later discover what I had found was nothing more than a dumbwaiter of sorts, but the miniscule, pitch-black tunnel that revealed itself&amp;mdash;after finding the brick that could be pressed, after jamming the bookshelf so the door wouldn't pull the clich&amp;eacute; shutting-behind-you-by-itself thing&amp;mdash;that tunnel's mere existence seemed more than enough reason to stare.

But standing around gawking wasn't enough. I obviously had to go in. Because even if it was a dumbwaiter, including to places my father had expressly forbidden me to go. But let's not pretend that thought gave me some rebellious joy; I'm in a castle that just so happens to have my dad in it, I'm grabbing the summoner the next room over, and we are exploring the shit out of this crawlspace *because it's there*.

Why do I need a summoner to help me explore what I could certainly handle myself? Let's just say my enthusiasm might have been tempered when I rushed excitedly into the wall-hole immediately upon finding it

But exploring could take longer and prove to be more fruitless than expected, then the kitchen, then the ballroom, and so on in that fashion. ""Let's try going down,"" the summoner suggested, blindly gesturing at a small hole in the floor. ""I could grease us up.""

""That... won't be necessary."" We could all easily fit down the hole, then the summoner, then me. This only became relevant when the summoner crit-failed a Climb check and landed on his creature. She audibly grunted, her face squished by his uncoordinated ass, but succeeded a Strength check to bear his weight.

Upon reaching the bottom of the shaft, but only found a small, unopenable grate. My attempts to bust it open proved fruitless, crit-failing two swings in a row and damaging my morningstar. The summoner then commanded his eidolon to use her bloodblade, a short sword carved from vampiric stone that we had looted off a big bad some weeks prior. The sword had shown to be incredibly useful in our endeavors up to this point, so imagine our dismay when it tied a hardness roll with the grate and both shattered at the same time. Rest in pieces, magical pink sword.

After squeezing through our second hole without the help of grease, we saw everything from a giant cockroach eating piles of iron&amp;mdash;a sight which thoroughly disturbed the summoner&amp;mdash;to, well... me. I saw myself inside a cell. I almost became convinced that I was actually in there, realizing it was something else entirely when the summoner edged in and the view quickly became both of us inside the cell.

&lt;!--End unnecessary exposition--&gt;

No longer enthralled by the amusement park of torture, narrow corridor populated by magically-animated paintings. The next thing we notice is that one of the paintings had an adamantine bar placed across it, bracing a length of rope. Long story short, while the summoner and I had been gallivanting about the dumbwaiter dungeons, the rest of our party had found this hallway (from the other end) and the sorcerer decided he wanted to join the pretty island girl in the tropical beach painting. The only problem was that he couldn't swim worth a damn and the island girl was actually some sort of fish monster. He'd been underwater this entire time and had maybe 30 seconds left before he would need to start making Fortitude saves to not *drown*.

Naturally, though the fighter did take care to rig the bar-across-the-frame makeshift anchor for her own safety. Meanwhile, the sorcerer was fast losing breath as he was grappled by and fought with the island-girl/fish-monster. Though he eventually managed to burn her face off with a weakened flame spell, the outcome wasn't looking good; the fighter and the inquisitor were helpless against the thick currents of the sea they'd thrown themselves into, and the sorcerer, now 85 feet below the surface, realized he didn't have enough oxygen to make it back alive. As we used the rope to pull the would-be rescuers out of the roaring water

""Where's the sorcerer?"" the summoner demanded as the fighter and inquisitor were ripped from the confines of the painting.

""He's dead

And indeed he would be, it became 55, and with the summoner's Haste it became 85. I had no listed swim speed, and the DM informed me I could move at half my run speed if I swam as a full-round action. That meant I could reach the sorcerer in one round if I passed my Swim check. Knowing my untrained roll would be garbage, and with not a second to spare, I cast Bit of Luck on myself, allowing me to mulligan a single d20 roll before the next round ended and take the better result. This simple preparation proved most handy when my first roll was a 9 and the next was a 19.

I'll try not to give anything away (because one of the players

First, with a HUGE twist:  back in history a ways, the dwarves disappeared.  They never made it to the surface in large numbers, never brought their smithing and combat skills with them, and never fought the goblinoid races.  Something like 99% of the dwarves vanished from the world, along with their underground citadels and fortresses.  As a result of this, when the hobgoblins made it to the surface, slaughtering and scattering them.  Shortly thereafter, a lack of high-quality arms, and eventually over the course of several hundred years they have come to conquer the whole of the northern continent.  It's been 20 years since the last boats of refugees came to the southern continent

The situation for slaves in the north is not very good.  They're bred like cattle and worked like dogs

The party begins the adventure as either POWs or slaves.  It consists of a halfling monk (parents were monks, an elven wizard (POW from the south-lands), and a half-orc priest of Torag (a blacksmith who was given Torag's holy book ""Hammer and Tongs"" to read, thinking it was an instruction manual for smithing).  They're in a small town in the River Kingdoms, many hundreds of miles from the coast, surrounded by enemies, no decent starting equipment

Their tale begins in mid-spring.  A small mouse, Mike, uses this key to escape in the middle of the night, and frees a few other prisoners who had some fire still in them (many had been slaves for generations now, and couldn't imagine life otherwise).  While sneaking around the town, they stumble in to the blacksmith's quarters and encounter the half-orc, who readily joins them as it presents an opportunity to escape what he has come to view as an evil enterprise.  The party thus complete, eventually making their way in to torture tent where the encounter a dwarf with one leg left on a rack, the party

1366380018.0,1codau,[EVE Online] A lesson learned the hard way,NoxiousPluK,46,5,21,"The story I'm about to tell took place in September 2011.

I had been playing EVE since 2004

First I like to explain some background about the game

Basically the EVE universe holds lots of solar systems
Sec
Everything 0.5 and above is labeled as 'highsec' and those are the safest areas to live in. They are controlled by NPC factions
Then there is 'lowsec'
Last but not least

In 2011, in the areas of the Caldari State NPC faction.
The most we did was running missions issued by an NPC corporation named 'Spacelane Patrol' in the system 'Josameto' (a 0.6 security system)

Now mission runners make okayish money. 
If you are running level 4 missions (and we often did that with a fleet of 4-8 people
Mission runners are mostly investing in better and better ships, speed, etc...), ammo and drones (little remote controlled ships). 
While income is slow
Stuff sometimes got boring but we had eachother
Every now and then we flew into lowsec or nullsec with cheap ships

Now mission runners usually have pimped out battleships
Those ships are offcourse attactive to pirates who like to get rich of your stuff and it was no suprise that half 2011 we were being wardecced by a corporation called 'Confedeferate Union of Tax Legalists' (including the typo yes)
All our members received an ingame mail from Concord, including highsec.

We gathered up in our home system/station before the war started and stacked up on ammo

Not very up to date with the war/agression mechanics
The Confedeferate Union of Tax Legalists were people who actively looked for easy targets

Now undocking alone wasn't a big problem. As long as you stayed close enough to the station and could sustain the incoming damage for long enough
After the first few losses we learned this the hard way and figured we should all undock together to be stronger then them. 

Easily said and done
The other members were most likely checking on the stations of the other corporations that were in war with them

We checked our ships EHP (Effective Hitpoints) and did send outside the member with most EHP first
The bait worked wonderfull
A few hours later we retried the same tactic. This time the same persion (who was the corporations CEO) was trying to bait us out in a worthless rookie ship. 
One of our members undocked and quickly flew towards him

Now he was mad, speaking brave words in 'local system chat'. 
They agressed us

Some days moved on

We decided that it was time to move on and do other things. No longer run silly missions in highsec

Now wormholes are special things in EVE. They work a bit like the stargates that jump your ship between solar systems
Those W-space systems have a security status of -1.0 and are the darkest areas of EVE. There is no police
It's dangerous and deadly

Wormholes exist in 6 classes, but every 24 hours respawned to another random location in the system and connected to another highsec system.
It kept us safe from the agressors, by loosing lots of ships) and staying safe.

The CEO of the Confedeferate Union of Tax Legalists in the meantime found out that we deserted the original corporation and went to look for us.
First he wardec'd (war declaration) the new corporation again
Some of the members decided to leave the corporation and some decided to continue to life in the wormhole and go to highsec as less as possible.

We got into contact with another corporation named 'The Condemned and Convicted'. Those people hired themselves as mercenaries to the highest bidder and were paid by [one of the other corporations](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14722806) that were in war with them. 
We decided to set a trap.

Without notice we returned to our former home system and sat there with a few 'bait' ships. Ships that were fitted in such a way that they could sustain a lot of incoming damage
We mailed him

The other corporation was a few jumps out with their forces

Soon after our bait pilot undocked he was engaged by the alliance leader and made sure that he could not get away by scrambling his ships warp drive. The mercenaries jumped into system and warped to our pilot who was quickly repaired and saved from loosing his ship while the agressor was [quickly shot down](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14662100).
His fleet ran away and stopped attacking us. We moved back into our wormhole and stayed there since that moment.

Thanks to his actions
We learned to look for fun again and not care as much about our ships as we used to

Still

Nowadays most of our members live troughout lowsec

Fly safe o7

1374708689.0,1izp3w,[Mount and Blade] A Kingdom is Born,WindmillLancer,46,6,3,"I had once been a sellsword traveling through the snowy northern reaches of the continent of Calradia. I found myself in service of the kingdom of Vaegirs

Nearly a year had passed since then, spending a great deal of time among the commoners and tending to their needs. Many of my rivals in court scorned me for the time I spent among smallfolk, but I took great pride watching the village gradually grow from ragged and impoverished to prosperous and vibrant.

My village was far from the frontlines, and the ruthless seafaring Nords to the west were constantly pressing into Vaegir territory and the Vaegir army often found itself worn down and outnumbered. Many of the nobles held King Yaroglek responsible, blaming him for poor leadership, greed, and disorganized management of the war effort. He would send the Vaegir host marching back and forth across the kingdom, always arriving a little too late to break a siege or repel an invading army, and when his officers captured holdings

But I was loyal to the king who had raised me to my station, and tried to build a more united front to repel the invaders. He eventually appointed me marshal of the Vaegir army, and I was sent to make war on the Kingdom of Swadia. I vowed to strike a blow that the Swadians would remember - the tide of war may shift back and forth, but this campaign was to leave a lasting mark. I called the banners and gathered together the nobles who had come to be my friends. We would not be raiding villages or assaulting lesser keeps on this campaign, I told them. We would be attacking the heart of Swadian power and influence, their trade center, the city of Dhirim.

Dhirim stood in the very center of Calradia and sent caravans to all corners of the continent. It was also one of the most heavily defended cities in the world. My army was large, preparing for a long siege.

The first assault on the walls was thrown back with heavy casualties on both sides. I rebuilt my siege engines and made another assault. Again we were thrown back. Again and again, in clear weather and rain, leaving mountains of bodies each time. Days and then weeks rolled by. Morale began to drop. Other nobles abandoned my army and marched home with their retinues. The King sent word - he implored me to call off the campaign and march north again. But I would not turn back without my prize.

At last, we managed to break through the defenders and sack Dhirim. But the carnage wasn't over. A Swadian warhost, led by King Harlaus of Swardia, arrived just as my men took up position on the walls. We found ourselves hastily repairing the defenses we had just overrun. King Harlaus tried to retake the city by siege. Three more bouts of fighting followed, and the Swadian warhost was left ragged. We sallied out of the city and met them in the field. Half a dozen smaller battles broke out on the country side as my nobles split up and squared off against the remnants of the Swadian army. I led my men against what remained of King Harlaus' personal guard, and once they were broken and fled, the war was done. I was tired, but I had done it. I had broken the Swadian power base and given the Vaegirs a lasting edge in their bid for Calradia. Leaving a garrison in Dhirim

There was no time for rest, I was sent to lead the army to drive them out. Weary but dutiful, I complied.

It was while I was on this campaign that I received a letter from the King. He recognized my service to the kingdom, he offerd me 800 gold.

The sum was a slap in the face. Not only was it barely enough to feed my army for a week, and it would be the first holding in a new kingdom that served no other monarch. 

Unfortunately, stranded out in the Vaegir tundra.

The first to approach me was my closest friend among the Vaeigr court. Before the Vaegir army descended on me and my followers

I asked him to let me go. He cursed and admitted that he did owe me that much. He agreed to give me a head start

Taking my small retinue of followers and soldiers, but it was one of the most powerful in the world, and damn near impregnable. I appointed those loyal to me to lordships, and soon other discontented nobles from the other kingdoms began to flock to my banner.

It was a death inflicted by cruel fate. I and my co-conspirators had finally received the order to take down the others occupying the castle with us. I was with the detective at the time. I grabbed the nearest weapon I could find, a pump-action shotgun, and blew his brains out without hesitation. He died instantly, I stole his scanner, and fled the scene.

For a short moment, go wherever I wanted. The walls of men could not hold me back. In my explorations, I happened across a small gathering of the innocent, one holding a shotgun similar to mine. Another said that he had heard a shotgun blast not long ago. The first vehemently denied discharging his weapon, for he had not. But the second would have none of it. He executed the poor soul in cold blood. And from there, it was like dominoes, innocent after innocent cut down in a frenzied panic, whether my brothers in arms survived.

I met the detective in a hall near an entrance to one of the office areas, with my companion close behind. On our scrambled frequency, I told him to act, to take down the detective. Too late, I noticed one of the innocents at the other end of the hall
""No, and the detective assumed I was on his side, trying to warn him. So I played along. ""I'm sorry, friend,"" I said as I killed my only remaining companion.

1367767341.0,1dqfot,[Call of Cthulu] The only RPG I've played. (Quite long),Hammerfell,50,10,8,"The game is Call of Cthulu set in the 1920’s.

It is the only table top RPG I have ever played to date and I will never forget it. The details are a little fuzzy but it’s enough to make out into a story.

I decided to play as a 6 foot 7 black Scottish man who distills whiskey as a living and despite numerous death threats by the locals

Anyway there are about 5 of us so far sitting in the bar drinking. Me

I may have neglected to mention that I have a close friendship with Al Capone as this was during the Prohibition era so guns are pretty accessible to us.

Onwards with the story

At this point me and P are on a train heading up and J and L are in a plane flying there taking overhead pictures of the estate that we will be investigating.

Once we the train arrived at its destination J and L had already set up camp at a hotel but we were several miles away as the train station was out of town. So we caught a carriage to the nearest town sparking conversation with a fellow named Joe. At the time he didn’t really strike me as odd but our DM liked to include little jokes in campaigns I just didn’t know when it was going to come up.

So we arrive at the town and me and P are unloading my 4 crates of whiskey I brought along just in case
What I neglected to bring what ammunition for said shotgun.

Skipping ahead a few hours and we made our way to the library which I was not allowed access to due to my skin colour but later bribed the librarian with a crate of whiskey to be let inside

We found out the manor we were investigating had a family that died many years ago and the husband went missing

Me and P

Eventually Joe popped up and offered us a lift to the gravesite


Night sets in and me and P get to work

Now at this point the DM has to roll three d20 and the lower the score the better as it means he spots us in the act and we get sent off to a mental asylum.

Natural. Fucking. Twenty.

Then an 18 and finally a 19.

It was as if the police man had come up to us and said “Evening gentlemen

So the police man goes off on his way and we finish digging up the bodies and surprise surprise we find fuck all.

So me and P set off to get some sleep and at this point its 6 am in the morning

Skipping ahead we’re all at the manor and all sorts of supernatural shit it going down

We investigate some more and look at the aerial photos that had just been developed and notice hundreds and I mean hundreds of black spots all in the fields behind the manor. We investigate the field and find the rotting corpses of cows all dissected in the same way

Later we think it’s a good idea to sleep in the house and get some rest

What could go wrong?

Well a lot of things apparently

We woke up in the morning and heard a subtle hissing noise coming from the kitchen

Now picture this

Me

So we were all like “What the fuck Joe” And Joes all like “Howdy boys! Hope you all like bacon!” while rocking a raging hard on.

Eventually we defused the situation and Joe thought we wouldn’t be awake for another hour or so and he feels more comfortable cooking naked for some strange fucking reason. Anyway I digress, then we found out that the beast living in the basement was only repelled by salt, so we took some shotgun shells we found in a shed and filled them with the salt and loaded the shotgun, only issue was now we were completely unprotected from the spawn of hell downstairs and he knew it.

In an instant we heard this bloodcurdling scream as if someone was being burned alive. I rushed out of the bedroom and looked down the stairs only to find Joe literally melting before me into a puddle of tentacles. Shit was going down. I rocked out the shotgun and immediately without hesitation shot Joe in the fucking face. I was not going to let Joe fulfil his sexual hentai fantasies on me.

So now Joe is crying and I noticed the salt which only blinded Joe had burned away some of the goo that was pulling him under into the bowels of the beast. We all put two and two together and figured that Joe was actually just an innocent gay man living in the 1920’s and fought he could have a chance with me by cooking breakfast naked. Not the right hand man of Cthulu.

The beast, I held him back for 1 extra turn by shooting in with my salt shotgun while my friends escaped. Then I used all 18 of my strength to propel myself into the window crashing outside onto the floor.

We ran as fast as we could away from the building and went straight to the general store to buy all the towns supply of salt. In the end we had about 5 bags of it  and decided the best thing to do would be to carpet bomb the house with salt. Yes

We all set ourselves up in the plane that J and L used to get here and made continues swoops down at the building, both going through the roof. As we flew off we heard the sound of hell itself opening, a screech so unbearable that not even with our hands pressed against our ears we couldn’t muffle it. And then the explosion happened, the beast must have been buried deep underground because the amount of goo that was sent everywhere from the blast was huge. Half the town was covered in grey goo and we flew off because we didn’t want to explain to the town why there friendly carriage driver was dead and why they were covered in Cthulu juice.

1376571400.0,1keyts,ad lib campaign makes players question existence,samuraijaques,54,19,12,"Just had the most amazing D&amp;D session I have ever experienced or heard of. I should start this off by mentioning that this campaign is entirely being made up as it goes. When my players say they do something I tell them how the world reacts

Today’s adventure started off with the players going on a dangerous mission with a ship full of dwarves (I know, Dokuga, ended up leaping off of the boat and into its mouth to tear at its squishy insides with his bare hands. The crew ate well that night; and for the rest of the trip. 
The adventurers managed to find their way to the wall of fog that the dwarves referred to as the wall of doom, they managed to make it through the fog to a beach with black sand. 

The fog was still thick near the shore so visibility was poor. They set up camp and prepared a party to head out into the fog. The captain of the ship led the group through the fog. No one, I had some vague ideas at this point. As they progressed through the fog they came upon a road of black glass and decided to use omen of peril to determine which way was safest. Omen of peril told them that right was to danger and left was to safety. Naturally they went right. Now when I told them that right was to danger I was basing that assumption on how I expected the characters to react to various things that they might find along the way. I have no way of telling them the danger of things because I don’t know what is going to happen until shortly before it does. The reason I thought it would be dangerous is because James, the druid, is a burn happy pyromancer who’s only life goal is to burn one of everything. Most situations that James is exposed to lead to bloodshed and corpses so naturally I assume that few things in the campaign will be safe. Anyway, they walk along this road for some time and come upon a horse drawn carriage being driven by a shadowy man almost completely wrapped in a cloak with his face mostly obscured by a large hat. His eyes are dim sockets of white in his head. He stops in the road in front of them, the dwarven party that is behind the players assume danger and all draw their crossbows. This is the part that I assume James is going to start some shit. But instead, much to my surprise, black shadowy humanoids with papery skin and holes in their faces for eyes and their mouth with dim white light pouring out; they dress in fine gothic clothes. 

The party continued along the road for a while and comes across small domes made out of the sand which I tell them has a consistency more akin to fresh snow than to sand. The domes are discovered to be small makeshift houses for strange little shadowy humanoids similar to the one that was driving the carriage. They mostly pay no mind to the party. Here again I expect James to burn everything and instead he attempts to talk to them

The city was constructed entirely from black glass and the people within it were much like the shadowy creatures they had found but seemed more detailed. I described it to them like the small creatures they had seen were like the drawings of a child and these creatures in the city were like the drawings of a someone more skilled. The creatures near the front gate spoke a garbled mess of gibberish much like the sims; a small improvement over the shrieks of the smaller ones but no more helpful. As they progressed further into the city the creatures became more and more detailed. 

The party had pretty much given up on talking to the creatures but decided to give it one last shot, something that Greb was capable of answering “I came from glass cylinder.” Sure enough a large black glass cylinder sat at the middle of the town. They asked Greb what he did “I am a glass spinner. Would you like to see my work?” 

The 3 of them walked back to Greb’s house and Greb showed him how he could pour sand into a furnace and then cause it to float out into the air and shape it without it ever touching his hands. He made James a bowl as a gift to the first person to ever be interested in his work. In their conversations with Greb he often referred to being “told” what to do. Greb would say things like “this one was not told to ask” or “this one was not told to leave” when asked who had told him he would say “this one was told by glass cylinder.” his life up to this point had been simple and he had seemingly been given a strict set of guidelines to follow. Naturally my players sought to break his simple world. They began asking him questions about why he had been told these things? Why had he never thought to do other things? If glass cylinder told him what to do then who told glass cylinder what to do? These questions obviously made Greb extremely uncomfortable as all he could respond with was “this one was not told to think”. 

Greb took them to “the thinkers” these were creatures that were “told” to think and if anyone could answer their questions than it was the thinkers. Greb led them through a portal into a place similar to the city they were in but with different buildings and denizens and this time it was all white. The thinkers stayed in a small building nearby and thought. Greb offered them his “passion for his work” as form of payment and the thinkers readied themselves to be asked a question. The party asked their questions

 Greb seemed to become more and more conflicted as time went on

The party went up to the cylinder and asked entrance which they were granted. Inside there was a spherical pink room that seemed to go on forever and a bridge that extended over a bottomless pink pit to a door about 20 feet away. They called out to see if anyone was there “I’m busy” a little girl replied. They asked if they could come in “I said I’m busy” was the only reply. They said they just wanted to talk “Daaaaeeeeemmmm” the little girl whined. A creature much like Greb but pink walked in from the room at the end of the bridge “were you told to be here?” still wanting to mess with the strange creatures the players said “we told ourselves to be here.” Daem, well, James at least, Dokuga was a tiefling. 

The little girl explained to them that she had been there “for a loooooooooooooooooooooooong time” and that she had been drawing friends to help pass the time. She showed them her pictures, it all happened completely organically, we made it up as we went. 

The party asked the little girl if she could bring back Greb’s mate “nope, once again acting completely against his character’s normal personality asked if she could let all the creatures think for themselves. The girl made one last drawing by taking sand and forming it into paper and ink and drew a blue creature and said “this one’s a teacher.” They left the cylinder to find Greb waiting. Greb asked the little girl, finally deciding to do something other than what he was told,  “what happened to my mate?” to which the little girl replied “I took her way, I’m sorry” “I forgive you” Greb replied “I love you Greb” the little girl said “I love you too” Greb replied. The “teacher” walked out from the cylinder, towering above the rest of the creatures and sat down on the cylinder, light and glorious music poured out of his mouth and into the rest of the creatures for a moment and then he smiled and relaxed in his seat atop the cylinder. 

The party left the city after taking Greb to go and pack his few belongings and found the dwarves waiting outside. The citizens of the city all came to see them off and wished that they would return someday. The little girl formed sand into gold to give the dwarves what they had come for and the players, the players told him he could just come back, he said he didn't want to. 

Basically the way I understood this was that Greb was the only creature “told” to love. And he had his love taken away from him. So he was the only one of the creatures that had ever had reason to question anything because he was the only one that had ever experienced loss and the only one that was unable to do what he was meant to. The rest were content to do what they were “told”. So far this campaign has seen gods released, and the players procuring an army of 250000 dwarven clone soldiers. It’s been a wild ride and I would encourage everyone to try and play a D&amp;D campaign like this someday.

I would get to a certain point in every game where pure numbers dictated I would steamroll the rest of the continent, and the very last campaign I played.

A word of note

So after all the world conquest games before, I shelled out money and promises like a madman to get trade agreements and alliances from my neighbors. No price was too high to meet and no boot too dirty to lick.

Except for one, the mighty Persian counterattack was able to carve into the heartland of the Ottoman Empire and secure a peace at the expense of 2 territories. 

Hate and envy clouded the judgement of the turk

This would be how the decades long Egyptian Wars would play out: while the common man in his masses fought and died to delay the superior turkish armies

However, the money was rolling in. With this properity and trade came technological advancement: the Persians had attained cannister shot, and the world of warfare would be forever changed.

The Ottoman commander no doubt chuckled as looked over the small force of Persians beseiging Instanbul from the nearby hills. Such a small army would never be enough to break the walls of his city

As the Ottomans sallied forth from their gates

The Persian forces were arrayed at the top of the hill, but as the missile cavalry moved to flank them their doom was ensured and the army was routed. The gates to Istanbul lay open and the Ottoman Empire was relegated to a weakened buffer state in south eastern europe. They would of course attempt to reconquer their territories from time to time, but a half stack of cannons and cavalry would be all the Persians needed to protect their one non-allied border.

This battlegroup would become the mainstay of the Persian armies. Cannons and cheap melee units backed up by a strong force of missile and melee cavalry and camelry. Standard procedure was to use the cavalry to destroy the enemy cannon and cavalry at the outset of the battle. Once their infantry was left unsupported

The Persian Empire had been quite careful to maintain a good reputation during the Egyptian Wars and was rewarded with a plethora of allies, the Maratha Confederacy were threatening to eliminate Mysore and the Mughals, both valuable trading partners and allies. The Persians began infusing her allies with constant gifts of cash while training an expeditionary force to relieve them in the war against the infidel Marathas. Suffice to say, dumping money into your allies can actually work, and with the help of the expeditionary force the Indian subcontinent was reconquered. The southern tip was redistributed to Mysore and the northern regions to the loyal Mughals with the Persians only keeping 2 coastal provinces for their own governance.

With allies on all sides except one and numerous trading ports, a golden age of influence began wherein her trading partners numbered 16-21 depending on the current state of world war and new nation emergence. Great Britain began invading Mysore and the Mughals, but constant infusions of coin and the sharing of technology with my allies prevented them from gaining any footholds there. Such was the wealth of my empire that christian nations began begging to join my alliance. This led to a surprisingly stable world order governed by an extensive network of trade and alliances in which Persia subtly guided the course of world events by funding proxy wars, sometimes against contries allied with them or with one of their allies. As new nations emerged, Persia would always be the first to recognize them and offer them all the cash and technology they demanded in return for trade. It was sometime in the 1750's when I stopped playing. Besides the proxy wars and arbitrary nation building, I had run out of things to spend money on.

Feeling a bit of pride as the exact type of pilot that the quote describes, unawares of it's status as ""On the verge of collapse"". Sure enough, my little ship collapses the wormhole.

Well

*Slight sidebar: I fit my Taranis class Interceptor in a slightly strange way than most. Neutrons in the high slots, and Warp Scrambler in the mid slots, 2 Magnetic Field Stabalizers (dps increasers) and a Damage Control II in the low slots. I effectively have no tank on this ship.*

*The reason I fit a sensor booster (the abnormal choice) is twofold:* 

* I roam around nullsec often looking for cynos to insta-blap. Sensor boosters increase the speed at which you can lock ships. I've killed a lot of them and the pods used to get away often. They don't anymore.
* When not lock-time scripted

I decide to start my cyno hunting trip and immediately stumble across a gang of 6-9 Talwar class Destroyers, Raptor class Interceptor. I escape (barely) but claim that had I not burned out my Micro Warp Drive (MWD) Propulsion Module. I'd have certainly peeled the Ares away and killed him. The Ares pilot proceeds to call me a cunt, then a pussy in local. Real classy, Insidious Empire.

So I make my move to a Station system in (luckily) nearby Stain to repair my poor MWD that burned out unceremoniously. Find a Rifter who doesn't want to engage without Hurricane backup

I see a cyno in system and warp to it. It is a Heron, Rattlesnake, and Gila. I pull range and poke around for awhile so as to entice them to bring a frigate out. At one point a Gila gets lucky with some Acolytes (I killed 2 of them and claimed Op Success in local) then they bring out a tackle probe to hold me in time for the Gila. Perfect plan, right?

Last winter break my friend decided to try a fourth edition campaign

My friend bought a premade campaign from a gaming store and worked with the party to make our characters. In the end there were three of us. The DM's brother played a controlling wizard (mostly status changing spells). My sister roled a pixie rogue

I thought it would be fun to play a bruiser. So I cave him super high strength

Then it was time to buy equipment. The GM let us have a a couple of free magic items of our choice

I decided to get some summoned plate armor +3, which could be used as a thrown weapon and had a neat ability where once a day, upon a successful ranged attack, it would knock the target and all adjacent enemies prone.  Because his fighting style mainly involved throwing either of his ax's he named himself Gethrow Gibbs, and his famous words were 'let me Gibb you an ax'. 

And just to annoy the rest of the party, which was used in at least one out of every four sentences. With our characters ready to go we began the campaign.

Our adventurers started out with a standard enough quest

We find a group of bandits in a forest clearing ad combat ensues. It becomes quickly apparent that the wizard and the rogue are a good match up, the bandit's attack bouncing harmlessly off of Gethrow armor. Gethrow chuckles. ""How Prophetic, (not a misspelling, actual word used.) now you shall transcend. 

Activates ability that sends and enemy flying back on a successful melee attack. Gethrow swings at dwarf, knocking him out. Gethrow stands in a badass pose while waiting for the rest of the battle to end.

After the battle a pyramid appears in the middle of the clearing and a strange magic pulls us inside the pyramid. 

We land in a pit of bodies. Combat immediately ensues as two carrion crawlers appear to fight the party

It comes around back to my turn in combat. Getrow yells 'Duck.' He then 'transcendentally threw his crashing great ax' which hit one of the enemies. Because of the weapons special ability all of the enemies were knocked prone (they were all adjacent to the target) Pixie managed to get out of the pit

After the battle the party heard a voice from a bag on a hook. Inside the bag was a sphere with a female eladrin's head trapped inside. The woman says she was trapped in the sphere by the master of the pyramid and new how to get out. Through a successful sense motive check Gethrow finds out that she was not telling the whole truth. When confronted

Through out the campaign it is revealed that the sphere gave the user magical abilities
(you can imagine how powerful this was in the hands of a rogue)

Anyway our party continued to wander the pyramid

Party gets ready to open a door

'You see a group of bandits who are as surprised as you would be had you not known that they were there.'

The bandits had created  barricade between us and them, and no way to retrieve them after thrown.

I look at my power cards and was hit by an epiphany. On my turn I spend my action point and Gethrow leapt into action. He flung his crashing great ax

""WINTER IS COMING""

Gethrow activates winter's arrival which teleported him into the middle of the enemies

Our group came up with a plan and entered the room where the bandit leader was. The pixie turned invisible and Gethrow jumped into the fray. By this time the party had learned how to fight together. Gethrow would point at a distant target and shout 'Fear my pebbly doom' which was his signal to tell the invisible pixie who to attack with her sling. Pixie attacks, letting the pixie and the wizard do all of the killing. 

During the battle the DM would inform us every couple of turns that something was slamming into a nearby door. After we kill the bandit king the door finally breaks open and a wolfman jumps out.

I get excited about the prospect of having a werewolf minotaur. By this time our party had reached level 11 and accessed their paragon paths. Gethrow's involved him getting possessed by his ancestor. 

Gethrow's eyes turn blood red. 

He looks to the other two. ""This battle is mine."" Aspect of dominance is activated

Party returns in time for the wizard to land the killing blow on the werewolf. 

During the battle, contract lycanthropy. What he did contract was Moon disease, which is a fancy word for Rabies. 

Gethrow was the party healer, he would attack anything in time. 

I decided to have a little fun with role playing. Every once in a while I would twitch and start to moo loudly. This

Gethrow looks at a nearby pillar, and Gethrow continued to attack it (I might have spent the whole time asking the GM if the pillar was bloodied yet.) Finally Gethrow crits and takes out the middle of the pillar. Not being a load bearing pillar, the top and bottom just stood there. 

Party rejoins Gethrow, and to allow the party to tie him up, all under the guise of being a 'trust exercise' (my sister rolled well compared to my shitty rolling.)

The now hog tied Gethrow is left in a separate room. The party then takes an extended rest. During the rest Gethrow disease progressed to its last stage

""moo?Moo!MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! *CRASH*' In the grips of mad cow

Gethrow crashes through the door. Pixie knocks Gethrow prone

Gethrow roles a death save
           
              Makes the save

                     A feat is activated that returns him to zero health
                                returns him to consciousness
                                         and makes it his turn.

Almost all of Gethrow's feats were put into making his lay on hands better. Gethrow uses all of his moves to heal himself back to full health. Ax in hand he smiled at his two teammates

The wizard Dazes Gethrow. Gethrow never manages to throw off the Daze

Every single attack was a crit

Seven Crits in a row.

After the second crit Gethrow is forced to stop and spend his turns healing himself and giving himself temporary hp through his prayers to Moradin (virtue again). Finally the party manages to slay him.

Gethrow smiled and whispered to his companions. ""I have transcended.""

Attack:

The sun is down, hoping to stay anonymous. Suddenly, a City Guard bursts in the door. ""The outlying city of Tierra is under attack! i need all willing volunteers to follow me now!"" All group members choose to run with the guard, with the exception of spetrovi, whose interest is piqued, but he isn't hasty to make alliances.


The party arrives at a small village in the southwest corner in flames, and all around a decent sized army of goblins. One party member perception checks high enough to notice some goblins in the far corner standing still facing the wrong direction. The dragonborn warlord unsurprisingly wins leadership roll, and the party members plan out their strategy: ""We'll go this way, kill all these mothafuckas, then kill all these muthafuckas."" Everyone agrees this sounds solid, so they begin their turns except myself, since spetrovi moved at a slower pace. Tabu heads to the fountain and accidentally miscalculates his squares, and bloody the other before he is out of actions.

Bengal, where there is a field with trees and a large cluster of enemies, as well as the broken tower.

Isamarin and Dusk head straight north

I finally arrive, interesting. This discovery leads to the dm pulling out a counter die, and placing it between the four mages. Uh oh.

Figuring the path of least resistance is best, and the goblin is suddenly alerted to his presence. In a move of desperation and quick thinking, he uses his mage hand to assist him in throwing a brick at the goblin. 18. The brick hits the goblin square between the eyes, and he falls into the fountain and drowns.

Meanwhile in the center, landing him on the tower, but prone, and surrounded by three goblins. Throzgar sees his predicament, and makes a mighty leap. Both throzgar and Davneiros pass a acrobatics check, and throzgar rights him as he flies through the air, landing planted on top of the tower. Bangle decides that jumping is too much work

The counter die moves to one. The party knows this needs to be taken care of quickly. Bengal moves as far north as possible, communicates what he knows, and readies himself to be launched. 

We both roll. He lands a 7, swings me round, and launches me...


straight through a bunch of tree branches and into the enemy pheonix that was standing guard over the goblins. Close enough. Nagad realizes what is going on, and his holy smite cracks it. Being nearby, I roll a 16 arcana check and discover that the barrier is weak to fire. The weaponsmaster creates a torch in the dragonborn's hand, and destroys the barrier. Throzgar takes out one of the goblins quickly, but not quick enough.

The counter die is removed and replaced with a massive earth creature, dealing 10 damage to the entire party.

Throzgar is tired of this shit, finally leaving only the mages, one goblin fighting isamarin and dusk, and one back int he burning village. Daveneiros and tabu manage to bloody the rock monster, and Bengal finishes it off with a massive fire attack. 

The rock monster teeters, and knocking two of the remaining three goblin mages off the map. 

Spetrovi notices the fleeing goblin on the far corner of the map, carving a perfect round hole int he back of the retreating goblin's head. After hints from the DM, spetrovi uses his magic hand again to pick up he 15 lb goblin, and interrogates him.

(in probably the worst russian accent ever): ""Tell me everything you know about what's going on here.""  'Why should i tell you?'

""look, but i rethink my argument.)

""Let's make a deal. I don't have a problem with you or your dead friends here

As i drop the goblin, being a constant source of fail for the group, attempts to pickpocket isamarin. He rolls a 2, her dog form senses him, and takes a chunk out of his hand. ""This is going to be an interesting journey.""",Tabletop,False,t5_2wqgc,True

-----

This is going quite aways back

A bit of background but Meridian 59 was, but one big difference was that it was basically full pvp and if you came across someone's corpse before they made it back to their corpse you could loot everything from them (made for some very interesting grieving). Another part of dying is that you effectively lost a level so the big threat was typically that if someone did something too bad, your guild was going to hunt them down and kill them to 20 (lvl 20 being the lowest level you were elgible to pvp at).

Anways

Problem with one of these helmets was that noone ever wore them b/c if anyone saw you with one on


Well one day i come across this fella and we have some choice words about who was there first to camp this particular mob, i play it off, and later in the evening come across him fighting abig spider. Now...being the sob that i am, i jump is butt and drop him like a bad habit. By this time taking everyone's items was pretty much frowned upon (especially since by crossing the wrong people you could easily find yourself killed 20-30 times and losing 20-30 levels in one night) but, like most people, you at least look at the corpse and see what kind of gear they're carrying around.

Well

I take it.

That was the beginning of a series of events that could only be defined as epic. All of a sudden you have people broadcasting across the entire world that i've taken one of the helmets and that it's currently in my possession and his guild puts a bounty of like 1,000 gold that was a whole lot).

Needless to say I pass the helmet off to friend as quickly as I can so that my impending butt kicking won't be for naught.

Calling in the aid of my guild and a few of our allied guilds we all gather and get ready for the storm that's i've started. This guy gathers his guild and their allies and we end up outside of a town in the southern part of the world (it's name escapes me at the moment). Well

Rather than have the first major server war break out

So here i am

Well as you may imagine

Fireballs were flying

That was my first true taste of what a MMORPG could be like

Sorry this is so long winded but reminessing is fun.

Remind me to tell you guys about the time I infiltrated the best guild on the server so i could gane access to their guild hall

1365971213.0,1cceg8,[Dwarf Fortress]...and thus ended the Deep Razors.,Bagelson,44,11,9,"So I just finished my very first try at Dwarf Fortress. As expected

The Deep Razors started as a group of seven, nearly half of which were children - a testament to the great fecundity.

Kobold thieves were a menace at first, the pastures and the quiet tomb spire.

But the Deep Razors were unprepared for the great goblin horde of 256. When word reached them of the new threat they laughed it off. They had weathered invasions before and felt safe behind their walls and in their deep halls.

Until the cave crawlers arrived. Until they blasted through the traps by sheer force of numbers. Until they smashed down the gates. Until they stood before the entrance to the fortress itself.

When the new scope of the threat became apparent

Sigun herself led a small group of soldiers against the invaders just beyond the first wall, slay the crawlers at her back and escape into the fortress.

Even the dwarven ambassador who had somehow reached the fortress through the enemy lines

The fighting continued at the gates

But the cost was grievous. Over 30 dwarves were confirmed lost in the battle alone, unprovoked violence and insanity. Craftsdwarves refused to perform their work and defences were left in disrepair; the lack of coffins left dwarves to rot in the halls, the miners refused to excavate room for new wells, new storage or new defences; traps were left sprung and useless.

By the turn of the season barely 150 dwarves remained

Then the goblins came again. More than 80 invaders crossed the borders

Looking over the ruinous state of the walls and the gates

The first half dozen trolls proved a powerful foe, the path to the mountain open.

What followed was a massacre. The corridors were cleared with brutal efficiency

And thus anded the Deep Razors.

Fast forward to the next day, elf thief, and dwarf militiaman - and I swear, the thief was doomed from the start.  We were simply playing through the pre-generated campaign intro, and by the end of the first fight, he was reduced to 2 HP while barely damaging his opponent due to a series of bad rolls.

This streak of poor rolls continued through the night up to the climax, and the wolves would not allow the party to approach, and so violence ensued.  Two wolves went after the dwarf, and one each for the elves.  The scribe was smart enough to engage with his bow, but the thief was in melee range already.  Several rounds went by with chipping damage on either side, but very frequently everyone running back to back failures (and by failures I mean 90+ on percentile).

The thief was taking a beating and on the 6th round of combat, and the thief's arm was demolished, forcing him to drop his weapon, and he fell to the ground, bleeding out.

He managed to pass the check to bleed completely out as the rest of the party (mostly the dwarf, and so the dice were rolled... 00... 1.  Critical fail.

This weekend we tried to give her back to her people. They didn't really care a lot

We entered into a room with giant braziers on each side of the room and a portcullis at the end of the room. On top of that is a ledge with some Dwarven cultists holding crossbows. In the middle of the room is a Dwarf summoner. The fight quickly begins as our group is the worst at trying to talk. The main tank and I charge the summoner right off the bat.

This wasn't a bad idea

The fight really isn't anything special. Dwarfs shoot crossbows

All of a sudden this summoner teleports into the brazier. he catches on fire and cackles. Confused, being the dick he is, teleports again. However this time he goes behind me and it causes fire damage to me, then knocks me into the fire and that causes more fire damage to me. Our Aritficer decides to be a hero and rolls a crit, dealing large damage. The summoner dies and we cheer. Then he comes back as an Elemental and we find out he was a bonded summoner. 

As he changes, I am knocked out. 

Roll my dice and I have a 17 on AC...it's a miss. I sigh

YES IT WILL!!! I roll the damage and hit for 11

So here are some short-ish stories of deaths I remember over my 10-ish years playing (all 3.x)

1) My first ever character was a Half-Orc Barbarian. It took me hours to put this character together while everyone else was going on with their game (I was new to the group). My first action was to cross a rope bridge. I rolled a 1 to cross and then a 2 to catch myself. The DM went ahead and gave me a third roll just to be nice and I rolled a 1 and plummeted to my death. For most it might have turned them away from the game

2) The last game I played with my old friends
Luckily I made good saves and had good AC (and deflect arrows)
So basically after a bunch of flyby attacks and use of rope and whatnot I was able to take down the entire group without killing them, and since I had a Vow of Poverty, I went around the countryside donating all their crap to the less fortunate and never played with them, or talked to them ever again.

3) Recently I made a pretty hardcore defensive Aasimar Paladin with great AC and all that jazz. Come across a Drow riding a giant lizard, the other stayed, so being the Paladin, I had to go back and try to save them...got grappled and sat on by a lizard while another giant lizard dragged the one away I was trying to save, then I was killed.

4) Just prior to the Aasimar Paladin, coins shift, and suddenly a big ass cockroach comes out of the ground (can't remember the monster, but I think they showed up in Baldur's Gate a few times as well). I get another bad crit and am bit in half in one shot and am dead. Other character gets pretty messed up, but no 20's dropped on him and they survive.

5) The latest death was me playing a Wild Elf Sorceror (that was really build more for assisting another player that stopped playing). Had another Elf in the group as well as I think a Human. We are surrounded by spiders, etc up so I was pretty decent on defenses, so I figure ""I know elves are immune to sleep spells"" so I drop a sleep centered on us, risking the other player falling asleep so we can kill all the spiders.
Didn't realize (as a player or a character) that spiders are also immune to sleep (I am someone who doesn't read monster entries as a player, I am tackled from behind by a spider and again one-shot with a crit, the sleeping character gets killed, and the other elf takes off from the dungeon.

He stated he wished to conduct experiments on him.

Landon Bremring’s Journal

With rings on fingers (the two of us, and that the reinforcements we needed would arrive.
We arrived at the Hermes Courier company and after a short delay in which Zazas managed to make both a gnome joke and an accountant joke to the surly gnome accountant in charge and received a shocking grasp for his troubles, and seven others from a mercenary gang known as The Sirens.

To say that I had my thumb and forefinger around Zazas’ left ear for the entire time would be an understatement. Although to be fair

The trip continued with a minimum of fuss – we integrated
On the final night, handled by the always-aware Zazas, was interrupted by a crossbow bolt puncturing his chest.
I awoke with a start – the ring on my finger was quite literally burning me

Crossbow bolts whistled past as another sentry yelled “ALARM!” and roused everyone from their sleep. One of the Sirens was performing first aid as I skidded in and cast a cure spell and yanked the crossbow out of his lung
Being as terrible at combat as I am, I’d forgotten that there was a five silver piece bounty on every bandit killed – and the proof was in the toes.

Didn’t need breakfast after that.
On our final day
As we got closer to the gate
When we got to the gate, they look through the crates containing our gear and they pull one out, placing it on the ground.
This was the first sign that things were going to be more complicated than they appeared.

Our cart was pulled over to the side of the gate

Mine.

I was summarily bundled into a jail cart

The day rolled away in relative boredom. Well, and anyone who opened their mouth (mainly one smuggler by the name of Steven Danzig, who came in with a few bruises and left with many more). I had a suspicion at this point that the only reason that they held me up was that damn cloak.

Sunset fell, including my signet ring.
Roughly an hour was spent in relative silence before I was dragged to a windowless stone room

“Sit

“What’s your name?” She asked after I was seated.

“Landon Bremring

“And where are you from

“Shortwheat.”

“And where is that located?”

“Two days walk from Silverwater

“And what are the common exports of Shortwheat?”

“Wheat

“What are your parent’s names?”

“Martha Bremring is my mother

""And what are their occupations?""

""They're both farmers.""

“And what is your occupation?”

“Novitiate cleric.”

“And do you have any understanding of why you are here?”

“Either religious persecution,” I said, staring at the blade at her side.

“What’s your relationship with the Hindmarsh family?”

“She is a sponsor. Of sorts, of the same family) might have provided.

“Care to explain further?”

“Can I say it’s complicated and Calistrian in nature

She frowned at that
“Well, and they will be in contact with your sponsor in Silverwater. In the meantime, you are advised to stay here. We will also verify the nature of this,” she says, taking the cloak from the table.

Hours passed
“The house of Hindmarsh has verified your identity. Because of your connections, this leaves us unable to prosecute you for the violation of the law. Not that we had much to go on - that cloak was just magically treated, and was not magical or dangeous in the slightest.”

“For carrying a questionable cloak that I didn’t know was illegal?”

“Ignorance of the law is not a defense.”

“You just wanted to hang someone

“We need a win. We need someone to pin this on, we lose their trust. We can’t pin it on you. We can’t pin it on your ranger friend, Zamith-“

“Zazas. Half-elf.”

“Zazas, which leaves your other friend, Callum.”

“And why him?”

“Firstly, trying to get through our barricade to see his knight friends. He’s threatened violence to a number of people, caused a great deal of damage, and has lied to gain egress to our facilities. Given enough time, it’s assumed that he would cause a great deal of strife and problems in our city. Thirdly, at this time, the citizens need to be reminded that we are being vigilant and that what’s being enacted is for their safety.”

“So you want me to throw Callum under the horse in exchange for… what?”

“What do you need?”

And this began the negotiations. For what it’s worth, and I hope that one day I will have the strength to find people like this – those who would make the laws destroy those who are innocent.

If sort of a dick.

In total, but before I went in and my escort left, they handed me a letter.

*“Train up
Signed by one High Inquisitor Mellon.

My jaw dropped at this point

Inside, massive grin on his face, and Callum, sitting there brooding, single cup of water sitting in front of him. I headed over and sat down.

“So where did you get off to?” asked Zazas.

“Finding our reinforcements. We’re heading back to Shortwheat with a complement of thirty city guards

“You’re joking

“No. I figure we can leave tomorrow morning, get supplied-“

“I’m not going back there.” Callum’s voice cut in.

“And why would I put my neck in danger? We can’t handle a hydra.” Zazas chimed up.

It is a two-man campaign

As they approach they see that it isn't only an armoury

There are three guards and a kobold. One guard (G1) is overseeing the others

Our resident rogue brings out his bow and shoots at G3

Our heroes run at the second airship and jump onboard

Our rogue is trying his best to steer the ship so the swordmage is left to do the fighting. He goomba stomps G1's hands and he falls out of reach of the ship, hitting his face on the hull as he goes down.

G2 attacks the swordmage and manages to knock his sword out of his hand

The rogue fails a pilot check for the first time. It's a critical miss.

Their ship veers out of control and smashes into the other airship, G3 matches the PC's altitude and throws a bomb onto their deck. SMall spikes emerge from it, sticking it to the deck and they can hear ticking. G2 leaps to his ship, barely missing. He swings his halberd up and it hooks on the edge of the ship. The rogue abandons his ship and easily jumps to G3's. (Let me just say, at this point I legitimately thought the swordmage wasn't going to survive) The swordmage drops his bow and realizes that it's too late to jump to the other ship so he goes below deck to search for a parachute.

The rogue stomps G2's feet and he falls

The swordmage frantically rips open boxes looking for something, when he comes across boxes that are supposed to be airdropped in to warzones. They have parachutes attached to the top. He runs back onto the deck and finds the lever that opens the hatch. The ticking gets louder and he sprints to the back of the ship and throws himself over the edge as it explodes.

The rogue tries to throw the final guard off the edge but the guard turns the tables and throws the rogue off. Violently. The rogue sees the ship exploding and boxes falling out and makes his way over to them.

The swordmage is falling through the sky, countless parachutes fall out, he grabs hold of one and sees the rogue falling, he passes it to him and waits for impact.

They both hit the ground and the rogue lands in the middle of a market. He steals a bow and sees a ""Brand new! BUY BUY BUY"" item

He gets close enough for his liking and loads an arrow into the bow. He takes aim at the disappearing airship.

Natural. Fucking. Twenty.

The arrow soars through the sky and strikes the hull of the airship

The party approached a modestly sized town along the river, and have learned about each other to some extent (in game - IRL we've all known each other for the better part of a decade).  They realized they can't all go in to town - there's no reason a half-orc would have such a menagerie of slaves, and none of them bound.  To allay any suspicions, they circled around to the landward-side of town, several miles out in to the hills, and sent in Ashok the half-orc to take care of business.

Ashok took the armor and a few other items they'd looted from their slain enemies to sell, where he heard rumors of various building activities to the south...  but nothing about his own escape yet.  He paied for his beer from the meager coins they had, and made his way to a blacksmith in town to sell the spare weapons and armor, spinning a tale about being a journeyman blacksmith traveling after the death of his master.  On his way out of the smith's shop, though, Ashok saw a familiar guard from his home town, and realized that the ship they saw a few days ago was still here!  He stopped briefly at a shop on his way out of town to get a few essentials (including a map), breaking out in to a run as soon as he was out of sight of town.

Mike the halfling had climbed a scrub-tree to give the party some forewarning about the cleric's return, so they took off in to the hills.  After an hour or so of running (they couldn't move particularly quickly thanks to Ashok's armor, Reirret the gnome found a small cave opening in the back side of hill, and they entered, hoping to shake their hunters.  The cave was cool and dark, a welcome respite after their exertions, but luck was not with them.  A [bugbear](http://paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO1107-Bugbear.jpg) made this cave his home, brutal fight

The companions explored the cave briefly, and a slight downhill slope leading to a swiftly flowing, icy underground river.  The party rested, ate cold rations, and slept for the night listening closely for any sounds of intruders.

The next morning they awoke to a dull boom echoing off the cavern walls.  Dust fell from the ceiling, and the smell of smoke which soon grew heavy in the cave.  Mike crept around the corner towards the entrance to see a very smokey fire and a wall of spears pointing in towards the cave - they'd been found!  The party held a quick discussion in the quickly warming room and decided that the numbers against them were too great to defeat, and so they decided to take their chances with the underground river, as it was at least an unknown fate against the certain death of staying or fighting.  Quickly preparing themselves by the glow of Ceal's ""Light"" spell, they waterproofed what they could of their provisions and tied themselves off on a length of rope so they couldn't be separated.  One by one they gave themselves up to fate and slipped in to the cold, rushing blackness.

We already have our ""assignments""

We all start with two squadrons of X-wings. The empire starts with TIE fighters, meaning only that player who bought the ship gets it. But all upgrades to the station are universal, so all the players can buy it and get affected by it.

My team (the rebellion(also it's a 4v4 match, as in every game of this type, the asteroids are the resource pads, gatherers, whatever you wanna call them. They also have defense platforms near them to provide basic defense. These platforms can build a dual laser turret, a dual concussion missile launcher (basically just standard missiles, (with the perk that they ignore shields and do direct hull damage)

I build my asteroid resource pad and build a laser turret. The laser turrets are great against fighters

My friend had bought the station upgrade and it was done upgrading. We now had access to Corellian Corvettes (the anti-fighter class of ships). I proceeded to buy 4 of them because I knew the fighter spam was going to happen soon. But I saved them in my reinforcements panel for later. Now wasn't the time to show my cards. 

At this time

The jig

As soon as our teammates fighters were destroyed, waiting, in the fog of the map. 

So the fight began.

There were only 2 to begin with. They were colored red, in case you don't know, one perk/spiteful thing about these accalmators is that they have fighter bays. These bays hold 2 squadrons of TIE fighters and 1 of bombers. As soon as the cruisers warped in they began disgorging these fighters and bombers. 

But while they had the initiative, and the shields of their cruiser began to collapse, one by one. While we were hitting them hard, the wild beast becomes ferocious when backed into a corner. They unleashed salvos of turbo laser fire and torpedoes. Their corvettes similarly attacked our fighters. I began to hear my nebulon-b frigate captains screaming that their shields were down. There wasn't much I could do. It was a brawl. And when you brawl in this game, you BRAWL. Its all in, all or nothing.

I decided it was a good time to buy some new units we had access to. The fight was in our favor, we thought...

I bought 3 of our shiny new assault cruisers. These puppies had a pair of overcharged turbo laser batteries with two laser cannon batteries as well. They were designed for battle. Born for it. I had all 3 built and ready to go. But I saved them

That moment came immediately. 

The original battle was to the far right. But we neglected the left flank...and they used that to warp in an entirely new strike force. And it was heading right for our space station.

Everyone else units had been committed elsewhere. I was the only one with available units. And as I had shiny new cruisers

Now. Warp in now.NOW. all 3 assault cruisers warped in

The battle on the far right was over and won, I meant ball of yarn. Lasers flying left, right, up and down, slant ways and what not. Fighters shooting fighters, TIE's, x-wings

Soon rebellion frigates and corvettes and fighters began pouring into the raging firestorm. Those 6 shiny new Victory cruisers began to lose their luster. Turbo laser batteries destroyed, break, and fall towards the planets below, one by one. The cost of this attack? Empire lost 6 victory cruisers, and 7 tartan patrol cruisers(empire equivalent of a Corellian corvette) and numerous squadrons of fighters. Rebellion losses: 2 already severely damaged frigates, 4 corvettes, 4 x-wing squadrons and 3 y-wing squadrons(y-wings are bombers). We knew where their base was. And so, forming a 3 pronged attack going left, new assault cruisers leading the way. 

And the base assault began. This was a war of attrition

Then the star destroyers came. They had a level 5 star base...

The behemoths of durasteel and death began ripping apart our formations of frigates and corvettes. 3 of them. 3 was all they needed to stall our advance...

But not for long. Remember, they each had 1 or 2. I decided to do what I had done earlier. Make a a sandwich with imperial turkey covered on turbo laser mayo, in between to slices of mon calamari bread. I warped in all the mon cal cruisers behind the imperials. 

It was a slaughter. 

Their fighter cover was substantial, with them losing maybe one turbo laser battery, or only slight damage to any hard points. 

But the empire wasn't done yet. They had more star destroyers, I couldn't see the colors nor did I care WHO'S they were. Just that they were there. 

I sent a mon cal cruiser to each one I could





Then the match crashed.



I sat there staring at my screen. ""You have lost connection to the match""
It was all I could do not to scream and cry. Everyone got booted from the match. 

You know what hey say about all good things. They must end. And while it didn't end the way I wanted it to (I'm still really really freaking pissed) I was happy and satisfied knowing that

As it so happened, Aza diverted from the well-worn path to investigate. There, in the Southern Wood, is when Aza laid eyes upon a most beautiful High Elf, bloodied and surrounded by a pack of dead Dire Wolves.

Then, demanded his money, his package, or his life. Deciding that none of those were rather pleasant options, Aza decided to make a third option - using a spell his father taught him to use in dire emergencies, he blanketed the area in a thick fog and dragged the High Elf to safety in the chaos.

Despite warnings, and fed her as best he could. Upon the third day, she would regain consciousness and inquire about the events past. That High Elf would introduce herself as Shival Hakor, married to the Elven King Matrim Hakor.

Aza Alarin introduced himself as the son of Tucker Alarin and explained the events of the last few days.

And from there, he slowly became attached to the woman whom had changed his life.

Nothing came to fruition until the second time Aza Alarin would save Shival Felwind's life: The day the Abyss was nearly opened and those beings that haunt the chaos of Xel nearly slipped out and infected the world with Chaos.

During the fight with the Unholy Order of Xel (a cult dedicated to opening a gate to Xel and releasing Chaos unto the world) Shival Felwind became surrounded by the chaotic energies, waded through the corrupting energies and cast a ward about them both. The energies would eat at the muscles on his legs, making him eventually fall from his feet but maintaining the spell all the while.

After the battle was over, he was the one awakening later and asking about what time had been lost.

Shival Felwind was not there, Aza didn't ask nor did he care). But, as Aza tried to rise, he noticed that his legs failed him and that he could not walk on his left one.

He was told that the corruption permanently disfigured him

After hours, a familiar shuffling of feet would resound and sit beside his bedside. And, each morning, they would leave. He had no doubt in his mind it was Shival, but he would never confront her about it.

1368860838.0,1ekf58,[Blood Bowl: LE] Last Meal vs. Arnheim Seahawks (game explained for the unfamiliar),ShaxAjax,35,3,10,"First a bit of introduction to the game of Blood bowl. Skip to the repeated dashes if you know how the game works. I should warn you this is not a tale of triumph over another person but over inexperience

Blood Bowl is a turn based fantasy football game. As the name implies, killing opposing players is a viable strategy, and most of the races are taken straight from the Warhammer universe (not 40K).

So, which is to engage in tackling and fisticuffs with an adjacent player. However, there are certain special actions to take into account. Each turn, you may have one player **Blitz**, which is to move and block; similarly, you may have a player in possession of the ball hand off to an adjacent player at ridiculously reduced risk once. 

Dice rolling is the real core of the game. It is by no means a gambling game, then finish with stuff that's nice but not critical. The reason for this is, any time you fail a die roll, save a small selection of unusual die rolls, your turn is immediately ended by a **Turnover**.

There are two broad strategies that you can classify a team into in Blood Bowl, don't fit these, but they're not relevant to the story.

**One Two Touchdown**: I'm explaining these guys first as they're pretty much a normal football team. OTT teams perform a three step combo: 1) get the ball 2) hurl the ball to a catcher near the end zone 3) touchdown. Interceptions and blocks on the ball carrier are the bane of an OTT team's existence.

**Meat Grinder**: These teams suck at handling the ball, so they can't be opposed taking the ball down the field. Failing in that, they engage ""the cage"", which involves moving your team in a specific formation with the ball carrier in the center to prevent the enemy from taking the ball unless they come and claim it.

A bit more about dice rolling: **Rerolls** are an extremely valuable resource in Blood Bowl

Some rolls:

**Block Rolls**: When you choose to ""block"" someone, depending on the strength differential between your character and all support they have and their character and all support they have. Each support is worth one point of strength. This is what makes strong characters great, as they can easily score a two or three dice white. White means that you choose what the result is based on what dice are available. Possible rolls are, in order of ""how good is this for me"" in a broad sense: Defender Down; Defender Stumbles; Defender Pushed, Both Down; Attacker Down. I believe Defender Pushed appears twice on a d6.

**Tackle Zones**: Each character projects, through which any opposing player has to successfully score agility checks to avoid taking one of the stronger block rolls to the face.

**Team Races In Use**

**High Elves**: These guys excel at the one-two touchdown. Unlike other elves though

**Ogres**: The Ogre teams consist of two races actually. Ogres, but are ironically less problematic than most of the dumb brute races. The big drawback of Ogres is Bone Head, which they must roll against before taking any action on their turn, on a 1 they don't do anything with that turn, as they've sort of spaced out and forgotten what they were doing, or got distracted by something, which also causes them to temporarily cease to project tackle zones and provide no support to adjacent allies.. This is represented in game by the gears in their head grinding to a halt. This is one of the handful of failed rolls that don't result in an immediate turnover. Ironically

The other race with an Ogre team, 20K versus an Ogre's 140K. Snotlings are even smaller, stupider, greedier goblins. They're so small that an ogre can actually bodily hurl them a good distance on the pitch, albeit without precision. They're also so small that they're nigh impossible to tackle, moving easily through tackle zones. This of course means they melt when attacked, even elves throwing 3 dice blocks against them with ease

-------------------------
""Monkey Steals The Peach""

Team Arnheim Seahawks: The opposing team, a High Elven team. Dressed in ornate turquoise armor.

Team Last Meal: Our player's team. Four ogres and seven snotlings, but in ragged loincloths and bits of padding, with their team insignia being little more than a reproduced muddy handprint.

To say Last Meal was outclassed is no understatement. The Seahawks are an established team with experienced players and cash to bear

As a handicap, a HMC, at the start of each half, adds 0-3 rerolls to his team, and subtracts 0-3 from the opposing team. Due to the smell of the cooking. I shit you not.

Anyway, which due to some particularly enthusiastic fans gives the Seahawks two rerolls back. So it's 5 to 3 on rerolls. There are eight turns in a half, and you can spend one per turn.

Anyway, touchdown. My ogres barely have time to do anything, and my snotlings are essentially worthless until things get going.

On the next kickoff, until finally I get an opening, passing the ball from an ogre to a snotling, who runs it to another snotling and throws it to him, who then runs down the field and eventually scores.

Second half, I had injured three elves, who were unable to join the Wall formation that the Seahawks were using. Point is, there was a gap. This becomes relevant in a moment.

Kickoff. Halfling Master Chef. 6 rerolls for Last Meal, even a blitz, before the elves get to do anything. I contemplate what to do with this, moving one Ogre not entirely on the front line in for a preemptive blitz, obviously, but what to do with the snotlings? Then I see. There's the indicator. The ball *will* land here. Snotlings are many things, but bad catchers they are not. Moreover, there's a gap from a downed elf. And the ball will land in reach. Abusing physics mightily, I'm down a few snotlings due to injury, he rerolls and fails again. Turnover.

My Ogres stomp the linemen and start moving up the pitch as I'm sending my remaining snotlings up, because tackle zones are night meaningless to a snotling. He runs a bit further up the pitch, which it may have been wiser to seek shelter with the ogres but I was desperate. Next turn, he's caught and stomped again, and this time the elves claim it, but my ogres arrive on the scene.

It's lights out for that elven courier. I don't have any snotlings in place this time, they get the ball and end up not even sending it out of the cage formed by the other elves. I'm okay with this. Three perfectly executed punches from my ogres later, and the ball is loose, it rolls one square toward the end goal. There's two squares between the ball and the goal.

This is my chance. The miracle play, and it's got no better time than now. I set my Snotling's path, he's going to go around the majority of the tacklezones around to the back, where the cage is weakest, and grab the ball. Then, now burning his Go For It rolls (two additional squares of movement for die rolls and possible turnovers). Up he goes, dodges tackle zone one and dives for the ball. Reroll pops up. The little bastard has fumbled the ball. I reroll

The little bastard does it. Slamming the ball down so hard he collapses himself, ragtag bunch of nimrods that they are, have triumphed over the might and majesty of the Arnheim Seahawks. There's one more turn, with them kicking off to us. I think you know their odds on that one.",Video Game,False,self,False,t3_1ekf58

I got on my horse, then turned right around and headed back for the room. It must have been about 11pm or 12am game-time at this point so it was obviously pretty dark.

The momentum of the push meant I was now directly behind her so I turned  to face back towards her. She hadn't even turned around, it was then that I first realised that the entire town was stood completely motionless. They were all saying generic NPC stuff, but not a single one was walking around. They didn't even seem to be doing the normal wall lean animations or anything, all of them just motionlessly staring in random directions. 

Two particularly odd guys were sitting on horses to the side of the bridge


I stood there looking at them for about 30 seconds, but it was a really eerie feeling just walking around a living dead town. I really was pretty tired in real life though, so I shook it off and started walking back towards the purchasable property to save. Just as I rounded the side of that house, one person started walking behind me. Naturally I turned around thinking ""oh good, everyone's back to normal"", but nope, just that one guy. I started heading back towards him and as I did so he turned around and started walking away

**The Character**

I always build my character first and fill in the backstory later. I knew I wanted to make a grappler. Our DM was very liberal about which splat books and dragon magazines we were allowed to use. Here are the important details:

Name: Nok Flameborn Kagalano  
Race: Half-Giant  
Class: A gestalt mixture of Rage Monk
Notable feats: Vow of Poverty, Firey Fists, various grappling feats. A permanent Enlarge Person was cast on him

Combat style: Nok's primary methods of attacking were leaping into the air and coming down on his enemies with a huge unarmed attack. He'd then grapple the target and pound them into the ground. I don't recall the exact number

Misc: One of the flaws I was allowed to take was that I would auto-rage in the presence of a dragon. Half-dragons, but there was no save against true dragons .

**Backstory**

Nok's tribe of half-giants had always been under the rule of a sadistic red dragon. They were his slaves, as the dragon simply sat atop his mountain, burning all who came close with its deadly breath and killing any who got close enough for a swipe of its claws. Every half giant of the tribe took part in that battle, even Nok's very pregnant mother. 

When it looked like all hope was lost, reducing his body to a scaly pulp. It was at that moment, Nok's mother collapsed, giving birth to the last member of the tribe.

This event led the remaining half giants to worship the rock

Although the half giants were free, Nok found purpose in traveling in search of his long lost tribe.

**The Battle Above the City

This was about 10 sessions into the campaign. Nok had grown close with his new companions, a Dragon necromancer.

The boat the party was on pulled into the harbor of a burning city. Atop the central tower was the dragon, and it was our task to get a few VIPs out of there and leave. Of course, Nok didn't have that option. He took to the rooftops and ran towards the dragon. He was followed by our dread necromancer-turned-troll while the others set about their task.

We got to the base of the tower, the DM assumed that with the dragon's fly speed, he would be out of range by the time we got to it. Not quite. With Nok's jumping ability and an assist from the troll, he could make it...on an 18.

The first of the dice god's blessings came as the dice landed on a 19. Nok soared through the air, had a grapple bonus one measely point higher than the dragon. 10 rounds of back and forth, with the dragon trying to shake off the pest and Nok clinging for dear life nearly ended when the DM rolled a natural 20. This is the second blessing. Nok countered with his own natural 20 and could make a maneuver.

I briefly skimmed the rules for grappling in my head. I needed to end this quick. We were rising higher and higher into the air

...

""I'll pin his wings.""

Nok curled his great arms around the dragon's scaly wings, but Nok was able to hold him in place. Though his death was imminent, Nok felt strangely at peace. He has become the slayer of that which he most hated. Nok was the rock and flame who was bane of dragons. Nok was the meteor.

1371114683.0,1g9ax8,[Medieval 2: Total War Kingdoms] The Grand Campaign for Mexico,WindmillLancer,34,4,1,"The campaign is Americas; the faction is Spain. 

It was the conquest of the New World. Spanish expeditionary forces had landed in southern Mexico, and found the continent thick with hostile natives.

I'd never played this particular campaign before

Our first adversary upon making landfall was the Mayans, and bring European culture and industry to the godless inhabitants. I stationed sturdy garrisons in every city I took, and poured my resources into massive construction projects.

Furthermore, to seize the would-be United States and defend it against French incursions. The New World - all of it - belonged to Spain, and Spain alone.

But with the Mayans crushed

While Spain had been securing its hold on the Mayan jungles and North America, I could manage to scatter them with cavalry charges and gunfire in the open field, but if they slipped past me they could easily swarm over the walls of even the most well-defended Spanish settlements and overwhelm the defenders with sheer numbers.

It was all my forces could do to keep these assaults from reaching my borders

So the Spanish invasion came to a standstill. The King of Spain was growing impatient

Then a new governor arrived from Spain. 

Governor Goncalo, arrived at the head of an army of fresh conquistadors. As his first act, the new young Governor declared that the greatest army ever fielded in the Americas would be assembled, and he would lead it personally into the heart of the Aztec Empire. They would meet the Aztecs head-on and crush them under the Spanish war machine. This would be the turning point - the force that marched into Aztec territory and broke the stalemate. They would force out the Aztecs and establish a firm foothold for subsequent incursions.

The most advanced military hardware in the known world was shipped in from the offshore foundries in Havana - heavy cavalry and handgunners and cannon loaded with explosive shot. Two full stacks were formed of the most expensive

Goncalo decided that because the Aztec forces were concentrated in the jungles on Mexico's eastern shore, where the open plains and hills would give even greater advantage to his traditional European tactics. They would sweep in behind the Aztec lines and begin carving up their lands from the inside out.

So Goncalo's army, with the young Governor at its head. So began the Grand Campaign.

Almost at once

It was no matter - the Spanish army swatted them aside with massed artillery fire and a fierce cavalry charge. The natives were put to rout and the grand army pressed on. If that was the best the Aztecs had to offer

But the march had barely resumed when another pair of full-sized Aztec hordes appeared. Again, it came down to bloody infantry fighting. The Aztecs were defeated once again, but this time the casualties were substantial.

Twice more were Goncalo's armies attacked on their long march through the hills. Every man his infantry regiments lost became a serious loss

But at last, as well as what few native mercenaries he could muster, Goncalo had the strength to seize the city, but it was perhaps the bloodiest battle yet.

Battered, Goncalo's army paused to catch its breath in the conquered city. By this point it was clear there would be no swift blitzkrieg of the Aztec heartlands - this was not the soft underbelly of the Aztec Empire, as I'd thought. Whether or not Xelaju could even have been held was uncertain. Goncalo sent a scout ahead of the army, deeper into Aztec territory, to see how long they had before another Aztec warhost arrived.

And what the scout saw was terrifying.

Descending on Xelaju was not one, it was over ten thousand warriors, and they were all marching towards Goncalo's beleaguered army of four hundred.

The steady stream of Aztec armies that had been fighting Spanish forces to a halt back on the eastern coast had been nothing more than a vanguard. As later became clear, the Tlaxcallans, the Tarascans,  and the Chichimeca. All of them had been either destroyed or subjugated, and now the Aztec Empire stretched as far as North America.

Goncalo had only one choice: retreat. Xelaju was a lost cause. They had to make it back to Spanish lines. Then there would need to be a full reassessment of the war effort - the Aztecs were more dangerous than could have been imagined. Goncalo gathered his men

But it was too late. The horde descended around Xelaju, making what cannons he had left nearly useless. Goncalo arrayed his bands of footmen - only 3-9 in a regiment - in a tight formation at the highest point on the hillside, and dared the Aztecs to come up after him.

The standoff was long and bitter. The fight was a butchery. The Spanish Cavalry charge was bogged down and slaughtered

All that remained of the army of the Grand Campaign was Goncalo and his five bodyguards against thousands of Aztecs. They'd pulled back to higher ground, smashing their foremost regiment and sending them reeling back down.

I didn't count how many charges Goncalo and his knights made against the horde, they cut down the Aztec general, but the horde kept coming. I ended up running down the timer - the battle ended, and as the defender, I won by default. The Aztecs relented and withdrew.

When dawn broke

With the path to New Spain clear, night terrors, and a burning hatred of Aztecs among them.

Best

Allow me to elaborate:
I arrived 45 minutes late (as I was subjected to the Tender mercies of London's rail replacement bus services), a Longarms/Infiltration specialist and an edgemaster) and a Troll ex-Shadowrunner turned military intelligence turned freelance, with two operatives guards. We had previously tried to have a 'talk' with said Troll (by the name of Wells) as he had been the middle-man for a experimental missile that was used as an attempt to kill us. We had failed.

The story was (which I picked up later) that we had encountered each other in the Foyer of an MCT owned building. We decided to take it outside.

I walked into a situation where one of the operatives was near death, and a rest for the Panther XXL Assault Cannon he pulled out of a bag.

My attempt to Long Burst Wells using the Rigger (which my character was) Van White Knight (LMG) failed miserably. Oh, but Wells... dodged (Edge). The Face did not, and was out of edge (I think, or he just gave up.) Said White Knight was loaded with the more penetrating variety of explosive rounds.

There was not much *left* of the face afterwards. We ran. In my defense, after the Healing Mage we had on the books fluffed the roll.

More about the Edgemaster: the Edgemaster is a sixteen year old girl, in which most of the current and former London  based Shadowrunners were killed (said missile was fired at us then.) Her entire *Raison d'Aventure* is revenge for her parents.

So, and was working for (sorry, forgot the name, Frank Drake or something, Prime Runner in Second or Third edition). He had helped orchestrate the purge. The purge that killed the Edgemaster's parents.

Glacial pause...

the Edgemaster shot him. Avoiding the attempted grapple of the Gunslinger (Edge), which a heavy pistol, using edge to gain an unholy number of hits (8, if I remember correctly.) He died. She pointed the gun at me, and held her action until I acted.

I had a Ruger Super Warhawk with Ex-Ex rounds (more lethal explosive rounds mentioned above) mounted on a hidden arm slide. I used it, no one watching) opened up.

Edgemaster burnt a point of Edge, and a Shadeem opened up a Mana Rift over London, from Highgate cemetery.

Jeb's head was knocked back against his seat and he could feel the entire world holding onto his body as the rocket leaped upward and pushed toward the sky. The shaking was so intense inside the capsule that he could barely see that the G force meter was reading that he was feeling over nine times the gravity on his body. As if several people were sitting on his chest. He pushed his hand toward the abort switch and kept his finger ready to flip that switch.

 But he'd rather die than make a false abort

A loud bang echoed through and he felt the explosive bolts push him away from the second stage. 
Suddenly, he smiled. 

""Stage separation confirmed

Jebediah could hear everyone in flight control roaring with applause through the comm channel. Even his icy cold CAPCOM let out a loud whooping sound. 

""Roger that Jebediah! What do you see up there?""

Jeb looked over to this tiny fifteen by fifteen centimeter glass panel behind him on the hatch and peered through. 

The sun was shining in the horizon on the west. It was setting behind the planet, snow caps on the mountain range to the north, and endless plains in the centre of the continent. He could see everything, but he felt like nothing. 

""It's beautiful up here flight. You would just have to see it. I see my house from here... at least where it should be."" 

""Roger that."" said Barger

""Stand by for retrofire position Hakken. We are approaching LoS... Stand... thruster...... south.""

Jeb was alone in the icy fringes of his world. Never had he felt more alone

1368712813.0,1eg868,[Shadowrun] A Fistful of Credsticks (X-post /rpg),amightyrobot,35,8,2,"Alright

Coltrane and I stuff what few credsticks we were able to grab into our pockets

As the elevator door opens, gave the guests the impression that the party was over). Two mooks stand by a table near us, facing the elevator. Behind them, another two are standing by the bar, and off to the right one more is just coming down the stairs.

We don't step out of the elevator - we just open fire. Coltrane puts a huge slug from his revolver in the chest of each of the guys in front of us; I finish the job with two rounds of flechettes from my shotgun

The two guys from the bar see their friends drop,"" the bigger one says. He pulls a frag grenade from somewhere inside his jacket, yanks the pin and lobs it in our general direction. Then both split for the door.

The guy on the stairs makes a face. ""Pussies. Gon' get me some BLOOD!""

He pulls an Ingram Smartgun from a shoulder holster and sends a burst my way.

The kevlar sewn into the lining of my longcoat bounces the bullets. It hurts more like being punched five or six times than actually being shot. But it still hurts. A little winded, and sprint for the asshole who probably just left me some pretty good bruises.

I drop my shotgun on the floor as I run, and he staggers back. I've drawn level with him at this point, and I leap high enough to bring my gun level with his head, then pull the trigger. Sweet dreams.

Behind me, and I'm left alone in the lobby again.

But not for long.

It's about a minute later when Grimm and Dom, swearing, not even closing his door in his hurry to clean up this mess. He heads into the hotel, and Grimm and Dom follow, along with Fury, who's been hanging outside since his ""distraction.""

So as Coltrane brings the elevator back down to the first floor and steps out, and then lied to some more. And he decides to come clean.

He's panicked, how after we turned the party into a disaster he was supposed to clean the whole thing up, ""recover"" the money and become the golden boy again. ""BUT YOU JUST COULDN'T DO IT, COULD YOU?"" he shrieks, reaching a crescendo. ""YOU JUST COULDN'T SHUT UP AND TAKE THE MON-""

The crack of my Super Warhawk sounds like an A-bomb in the empty lobby. Caravaggio's knee explodes, asshole,"" I grumble as I pull my whiskey from a pocket. I swig down the last of it and discard the bottle as I walk over to our prone former employer. He's still moaning in pain.

""Shut. Up."" I say quietly

""Please

We whirl to see a bent-back old man, and my son may be a fuckup, but he's mine to deal with. Let him go and leave these premises.""

I chuckle and thumb the Warhawk's hammer

""Or what?""

His hand suddenly splits and opens up to reveal a huge pistol with what appears to be a tiny rocket-launcher attached. Caravaggio brings the rocket level with our heads... then points it up

""Or I bring this whole place down on your heads!""

At that, aiming for the suped-up cyberarm, but the shot goes wide. Dom, for his part, charges the elderly cyborg, bellowing, ""COME ON THEN

Caravaggio flinches, leaving a wide crater of charred flesh. Dom collapses to the floor, unconscious and bleeding out.

At this point

Fury, but the old man dodges both, moving too quickly to even see.

The room starts to get hot, tossing my pistol away in favor of my favorite melee weapon. She's a pre-Awakening baseball bat, with a railroad spike driven through the head. I call her Bertha.

I swing wildly at his head and grab for the doll

It's Grimm who turns the tide, the father is still standing, but he looks to be in bad shape, and he sprints for the elevator.

The fire spirit's work is very much in evidence now

Fury lets off two shots from my shotgun as Caravaggio flashes by

I drill two short bursts from the Ingram into his back. They don't look like they hurt much

I go jumping after him, I avoid damage because I landed on Caravaggio, who is now decidedly beyond saving. I toss the corpse for valuables, coming up with the matchstick fetish, a customized revolver and not much else, then climb back up to the lobby.

We can hear the Knights Errant on their way, so we leave him for the cops. They'll get him to a hospital, at least.

Outside, hops in and I follow on my motorcycle to an unscrupulous contact of his so we can fence the car. After some particularly inspired negotiating on Coltrane's part, we clear 6000 Nuyen for the car. 

Along with the remains of the credsticks we scooped off the floor of the basement

We're just happy to have survived with our skins.

The battle starts, take out the other healer, interrupt their resurrections, and then take out the knocked down healer. It works. We kill one healer, take down their elementalist and their mesmer, then their other monk, and finally finish off their frontline, a ranger, as they had not prepared for this kind of warfare.

*Drip

The blood is dripping from the bags hanging from the ceilings. Probably what is left from the last unlucky few to wander in here.  

I was told to stay away from here. I was told that this place was dangerous

I wandered the dimly lit halls, I kept wandering the halls. Blood stained the floors and seemed to trail on forever. I walked past a door, barricaded by lockers, beds and any other items that you could cram in. I peeked into a nearby window, only to find an empty room left with the remains of the people who had ultimately met their fate; their flesh long gone, leaving behind only skeletons.  

I kept wandering hoping to find anything of interest, rusted, lifeless. I dwelled for what seemed to be hours, until I finally stumbled upon a room, what appeared to be a doctor's office, lit only by the dim light of a working computer terminal. I started going through the files. First, I found a list; 93 names of people deceased, others dead because of cancer, but was never revealed the true nature of these 'experiments'.  

Sick to my stomach, the rooms where these experiments took place. A terminal on the wall read 'Test Chamber 01'. Inside, a heavily mutated corpse was on a small table, its upper body almost doubled in size. Its skin was blistered, bones and muscle visible in some parts and a look of fear and agony was spread across its lifeless face. It wore a jumpsuit, ripped by its rapid growth. My Geiger Counter was buzzing, a symbol that the radiation still lingered from the experiments.

A single tear came streamed down my face, and started taking deep breaths. It was obvious that these people went through hell, and I had no business being here. I needed to leave, and quick, but before I started to get up, I heard a sound coming from down the hall.  

*Thump

The sound of footsteps throughout the decaying halls

So here I am, I will be taken, I will become one of them now, forced through the same pain and agony as all of the others in this metal tomb. So let this be a message:


Never enter Vault 87; because you won't ever get out. Instead


*Note to anyone who doesn't play Fallout 3: This story is pure fiction, this rusty vault was used as a government experiment and the terminal with the deceased list does exist, along with the test labs and failed experiment. The story came to mind as I was wandering through it.*

A little back-story on the characters. Broon is a half-orc fighter. He grew up in the wilderness, was murdered. Both ended up in the town of Mayce, where they begin their journey.

Log 1 of Broon
 
We began in jail
and thought I was ‘suspicious.’  So I was thrown into the jail.  Days passed
and I met a scale by the name of Torinn.  ‘Easy’ Torinn

We heard fighting and shouting from the surface above.  A goblin by the name of Marx came in and released us.  He was the Captain of the Guard, wielding a massive blade.  His underlings were fierce, vicious.  They would use a pack strategy on us, picking us off one by one.  They would take to the rooftops, jumping down upon us.  Many times I was knocked unconscious by their blows.  However, after a few of them were killed by the guards.  I myself attacked their leader many times.  

There was a standoff as lives were lost on both sides.  Finally, it was all an elaborate hoax, designed so that the mercenaries could kidnap a man.  We found a token that the mercenaries had dropped, a scythe with a sword underneath it.  A local tavern held a similar symbol, which we investigated.  We went to the tavern, and talked to the owner, who was a Tiefling.  He had a symbol of a scythe and field on the wall, became defensive.  We intimidated him by insulting his masculinity, getting killed in the process.  

We showed the book to Marx, which we also found in the house.  We took these to Marx, and then went to the only person whom this young man confided in, and even he didn't know much.

This friend of the young man pointed out that the young man’s father lived in the capital of Salthirn.  He had run away from his father after an apparent falling-out.  Marx is going to supply us with allies in our journey there.  

Hopefully we’ll be able to wrap this up soon.  I am not sure what to make of my new companion

We are all chaotic neutral and we placed an explosive smoke grenade at the entrance for a timed explosion to blind the tavern for a distraction.

The Bard (me) enters with the Warforged who feigns ignorance and acts like it is merely a showpiece that I command.  A harlot approaches us but we reject her.  I begin playing music on my Harmonica and he performs feats of strength to draw a crowd and distract the patrons.

Meanwhile the Warlock enters and also denies the same prostitute. He sneaks and is attempting to break into a hidden room behind the bar while we provide a distraction.  However

At this point we had a trap set up to do a similar blinding attack and it goes off.  However

The warforged leaves me with the other blinded NPC's and begins helping the Warlock loot the secret room like maniacs while in my disoriented state I cast a powerful burst attack for fear of being attacked by the NPC's.

So everyone but the girl was fried to a crisp. And she was bloodied.  In our last seconds before the building collapses we find out that the prostitute from earlier was the gang leader in disguise and she escaped and this lady is an actress.

We end up in a secret tunnel after the building collapses above us.  22 civilian deaths (upstairs and down).  3 enemy deaths.  Thank god we're chaotic neutral and no one saw us.

The money part of my plan never turned out too well
  
After a few weeks of mastering the Heroic dungeons
  
I grew to love PvP. It was about outsmarting your opponent (I really pressed that stun-key well), I required a teammate.  
  
After an hour of searching I found a warrior who was willing to play with me. I payed the terrible price of 80 gold coins to get a team (I never

Together we keep playing and improving. We play together hundreds of matches and really start to ""get"" the game. Our team's rating steadily increases and we finally break the 1850 barrier, I was assassination specced in Season 3. Problems?)*.  
  
I stopped doing battlegrounds
  
I also grew really fond of the priest. He was from the Netherlands and was a few years older than me. He felt kind of like a big brother. With our overpowered Vengeful Gladiator's weapons we managed to push our rating over the magical barrier of 2000. That was probably the happiest moment of my life. We worked really hard to get there
  
The priest also got me into this super elitist guild
  
We didn't talk much during matches anymore
  
Conveniently a few weeks after the end of season, my good friend had found someone else to play with. I can still feel a sting in my chest when I think about it. So what did I do then? I didn't rage or anything, I locked up the nasty feeling somewhere in the back of my mind and turned to apathy.  
  
I tried my luck with plenty of other teammates
  
There was one aweful thing in WotLK that really turned me bitter. The health pools were very low compared to damage output. It was not uncommon to get killed in 2-4 seconds against one or two opponents. I trusted Blizzard to change things back to good old days of chess-like PvP and I leveled plenty of characters while waiting. But Blizzard never went back
  
I found a private server that was created only for the purpose of Arenas in the last patch of Burning Crusade: 2.4.3. Dominated by my nostalgia trip, but I was approached by a druid who told me he remembered me. He turned out to be an officer from my old guild.

The party woke the next ""morning"", and as such figured they'd explore the rest of the area, searching for any sort of equipment that might have survived the battle and the ravages of time, and Ashok had told the rest of the party about the useful properties of cold iron, so they were all excited.  They decided to continue down the grand hallway they had begun on, advancing cautiously as they approached the source of the \*skritch\*.

The noise stopped abruptly.  The companions froze and searched about, it burst forth from its cover, a man-sized, red-skinned being of some sort with jagged teeth weilding a jagged glave.  A near twin of the monster came out of the shadows from the opposite side of the cavern, and out of the blackness of the ceiling swooped a much smaller version with wings sprouting from its back.

The party waded in with an eager grin, and the party was soon on their heels and fighting for their lives.

(Meta-note here:  While I had huge chunks of plot ready to go, bypassing their damage reduction.  I'm going to dramatize the conclusion of the fight instead, though, because it makes better reading and it's what I *expected* the party to do...)

Reirret, sensing an opening, flashed forward and struck a powerful blow with his spiked gauntlet, tearing a large rent in the demon's belly.  The abomination roared its defiance, then fell to its knees and lay still.

Mike turned his attention to the demon fighting Ashok and began hurling more of the shards of cold iron.  This demon had seen the fate of its companion and wanted nothing to do with the deadly monk.  It attempted to maneuver itself in to cover, meanwhile, went to help the beleaguered Ceal Gladstone, who was suffering at the hands of the small winged demon and was beginning to slow and tire thanks to the effects of its poisonous bite.

Between them, meanwhile, failed to evade Reirret's grasp.  Reirret's gauntlet protected him from its bite, and he dashed its head against the ground, stunning it long enough to wind up his flail and smash the pest to a red paste upon the smooth stone.

The party was rushing along underground, they suddenly found themselves falling from the ceiling of a cave in to a large underground lake.  After a few (thankfully successful) swim checks, the party began making their way towards a shore, thankful to be alive despite their bumps and bruises.

One of the party (Ceal Gladestone the elf

The cave turned out to have some soft illumination in the form of a glowing lichen that spread over the bottom several feet of the cavern closest to the water.  The huge rush of water wasn't filling the chamber, damp, and loud.  The chamber itself was roughly circular around the lake, so they picked a direction and began searching for an exit.  They found one roughly half an hour later, a rough hole in the wall which ran slightly uphill and wide enough for two to walk abreast.  The cave system (for indeed it was not a single tunnel) lead them through many twists and turns, and even an encounter with a small group of kobolds (who were swiftly dispatched).  Chasms plunged deep in to the earth across their path, but they successfully passed the challenge with some well rolled jump checks.

Eventually Ashok noticed something about the walls - instead of being natural stone formations, but he couldn't suppress his surprise and happiness at finding the rare metal.  It was then that the party realized that the cave was actually a mine.  Further exploration along this path led them to an ore-cart on rails, several broken picks and other mining tools, and the hope of finding a safe place to rest.

They followed the rails to a large metal and stone double-door built in to the cave wall, with tall stone pillars smashed and laying across their path.  Signs of a long-ago battle were numerous, with smashed bones and shattered weapons and armor littering the dusty floor.  The party advanced cautiously, but nobody noticed the first magical trap until it was too late.  Fire rained from the ceiling on to Ceal, who was untouched.  Ceal revealed that the ring he had found was in fact a ring of fire resistance, and it likely saved his life.  The party suspected that there would be many more traps of this same sort in the hall, but Ceal came up with a clever solution:  he summoned firebeetles and sent them ahead of the party, they entered one and discovered the smashed and rotted remains of a barracks.  The beds and tables had rotted away with age and neglect - those that hadn't been smashed.

I decided to then put her to the test and cause a little mischief. I rode to Armadillo and proceeded to shoot NPCs up to get the bounty challenges done. When things got way too hot for me to handle, we were outlaws to the very end.

Real life days passed. My friends had become quickly aware that Sasha was not to be touched. We continued to cause mischief while also cleaning up the west. We killed anyone that wasn't with us and she had lived through numerous player encounters, that one day she was going to die...and I was dreading that day more and more as time went on.

Real life weeks later

After a bit of riding

Even though it was a couple of weeks ago, while looking at the map I heard a loud barking and growling. When I went back to see what the ruckus was about....it was too late...Sasha had fallen...

I was in shock. I couldn't process what had just occurred. I couldn't speak. All I did was take out my gun and shot the wolf in the head. I walked over to it's corpse after locating it and released every single bullet I had into it's limp body...with every single gun I had. I threw every knife, save the few I threw at NPCs...so I could gather their ammo and shoot the murderer of Sasha some more. After I had exhausted all my ammo I tried to punch the corpse, but I could not. In a fit of rage I stole a passing carriage and drove it of a nearby cliff, killing the two horses and myself in the process. I then broke the news to my friends in the party.

And that is my mournful tale. I hoped you enjoyed and feel free to comment with constructive criticism and even your own stories. I have still to name my new horse. Looking back I always thought that Sasha would go down running into gunfire to try and save me but the irony was that she died doing what we had first did...which was hunt the animals. But I will always remember my friend and comrade. Sasha was more than an animal...she was an outlaw.

Scarface was described lovingly by the DM as ""a bad-ass with an m16 and a huge scar running down his face"", the group had little cohesion and things got out of hand real quick.

So anyways, we do some good-faith work for the leader; a search and rescue mission for a radio team gone missing while searching for more survivors. Being a Call of Cthulhu game, this leads us to a haunted house. Long story short, we accomplish the mission and find coordinates to a more sophisticated group of survivors in Oklahoma and return to Camp Scarface.

When we get back, arranging that we would trade stuff we find while on scouting missions to him in exchange that he monitor the marketplace and trade for items of our choosing while we're gone. We're in the best position yet in the game with only zombies and Scarface as our implacable enemies. However, theres trouble in paradise because our encampment has picked clean the surrounding area and in order to get supplies for a migration to Oklahoma we have 3 choices: search farther afield and hope for the best, trade/convince other armed groups near us to give/find supplies, or take the supplies by force from the other armed groups. This decision is left up to me to decide.

Scarface had warned us when we joined the new group of survivors that if we ever did anything to hurt innocents again he would hunt us all down. This was a very real threat as he would be proven to be significantly higher level later on. So I go to him with this dilemma, I go talk to the leader who says he'll talk to Scarface, great. Then I go to our tradesman to get him to listen to popular sentiment around camp regarding the PC group vs Scarface issue. Then I talk to my group itself and the best bout of roleplaying yet occurred with everyone arguing in character about past events, current problems, and future courses of action. One PC threatens another with bodily harm, the threatened PC pulls his holdout pistol and points it at the other's crotch. Im coming around the table to break them up when Scarface shows up and puts a gun to the head of PC with the pistol drawn. At this point, we hear a ""bloodcurdling howl"" from outside followed by tremendous banging on a barricaded door.

The fight dissolves as people go for their stored weapons and form up around the barrier, ""Do you have any silver bullets?""

BAM! the door slams open, and I know in my heart there will be no bargaining with him even though it was an accident, so I turn and try to light him up too. He dodges out of the way of the flames and shoots me with his M-16. Wounded, I drop the makeshift flamethrower and return fire with my .357, wounding him. Meanwhile the werewolf comes up from behind and slashes me to 1 hp with its claws. I grapple with Scarface and fall to the ground, pulling him between me and the werewolf.

2 of the other PC's run like bitches (and survived for quite some time after stealing my truck to make their getaway). The other 2 PC's stayed and tried to save me. They fought like champs but without silver were unable to do any lasting damage on the werewolf which killed them. 

So picture it, and small fires are breaking out because of my shenanigans. Chaos, my friend, it was chaos. Throughout all, I was locked in a death struggle with Scarface. I'm sure there were better actions I could have chosen, but I told the DM every round that I was continuing to strangle Scarface while using him as a meat shield. During the course of our grapple, my level 2, 1 hp left character rolled 3 20's, but I failed to confirm any of my criticals. I'm still doing damage to him though

The next session I wake up underneath a dead Scarface to the sound of shuffling, and my truck is gone. Does a werewolf's claws spread lycanthropy? I guess I have to survive long enough to find out.

1364313989.0,1b1pvr,Why we like old MMOs(Dark Age of Camelot) Repost from the Golden Age of MMOs! ,Bior37,25,0,8,"What follows is a repost of a story I told last summer. Seemed a good thing to add here. : 


It was the people. The community. Living in a virtual world. A harsh virtual world that brought people together and encouraged to you team up. Modern MMOs try everything they possibly can to make sure that you never play with anyone else.
I'm going to tell a long story. Like many who started playing MMOs back in 1997-2003
So I will tell you a story of one of my first big group experiences in Dark Age of Camelot. This story emphasizes many of the features absent from modern MMOs. Settle in

I was a level 7 Armsman wandering around Camelot Hills looking for something to do. I walked about exploring, which pulled you into the world like you wouldn't believe). I talked to some players, and many of them mentioned a place called the Tomb of Mithra.

I decided to go up to the local Keep and talk to guards there. They referred me to the local crier. I wasn't sure where he was. I typed ""/where Crier Ulwyn"". The guards literally pointed me in the right direction. Quests were rare in DAoC, and for finding new places you didn't know existed. The item reward was secondary. NPCs existed to flesh out the world and make it feel like a place. There were lots of dialogue options with even the lowliest NPC villager.

I talked to the crier, basically explaining how it was a horrible hell hole and I should stay away from it. I decided I must go there.

I asked some veteran players that were around how to get there. I still remember the directions. ""Go north along this road until you see a guard tower
I was nervous the whole way to the tomb, which made you feel grounded in the world and invested in everything around you. The world was a dangerous place.

I made it into the tomb with only a little health to spare, with stairs leading down, and undead guardsmen at the bottom.
I was a low level

I slipped by the guardsmen into the next hall. I remember a friend's advice, turning through a few corridors. I passed other warriors fighting unspeakable horrors (dungeons were NOT instanced, and in fact were where many socialized, as you will see). I rounded a corner and..bam, I got killed by a horde of Roman Soldier skeletons.

I shouted for help as I bled out and two people eventually found my body and brought me back to life, and we exchanged a few words before deciding to group up.
All right! 3 man strong we pushed deeper into the dungeon, and about to die. Our group charged in to help, just barely staving off the enemies and saving the 4 people. Again, thanks all around, a little joking, and we decided to group. With the 7 of us, we could easily kill anything in The Promise Room, to areas of the dungeon most of us had never seen. We decided to go right.

We passed rooms with giant meat hooks and flayed skin stretched on walls. We passed ritual chambers full of dead Roman Generals, and underneath, was the basement level, where many horrors spawned from. At the very bottom was a place called The Disciple Room. It was perfect. We made it in and set up shop, killing enemies 8 at a time. Then we'd sit to recover our health and wait for a respawn, talking in chat, laughing
There was a group of notorious mobs in this dungeon called Bleeders, sometimes including their brood mother. Everyone lived in fear of these wandering monsters. Rumor has it they were attracted to silver items. I had picked up a silver lined map case.

Two scouts ran into our room and started biting me. I stood up quickly to avoid more double damage hits and pulled out my shield. Our cleric healed me and shouted ""Shit shit shit! Kill them quickly!""

We tried, and I was already starting to make peace with the idea of losing another chunk of xp. But then our tank stepped up.

""I'll hold them here, loading screen.

Huh... Apparently there had been a secret invisible exit to the dungeon. Our party was spit out into an...upside down house that slanted heavily to the right. We could see out the windows...some sort of demon gathering. We could even overhear some of the profane dialogue.

We all tried to gather our wits and wait for others to load in. We watched the health bar of our brave tank go down to nothing as the bleeders overwhelmed him. We thanked him for his selflessness. ""Hey
With a little deliberation we decided to try sprinting out the front door and escape from the demons. I kicked it open and we burst out. As we sprinted

We trained the demons straight back to the Camelot garrison and watched as the guards cut them down. We cheered and celebrated our escape and then met back up with our tank. Only then did we realize it was 3 in the morning. We decided to call it a night.
We added eachother to our friends lists and I ended up grouping with them at least once a week for the next several months.

I made many friends that night. In fact most of the friends I met in that game were from just doing PUGs in PUBLIC dungeons. These are things that no longer exist in modern MMOs. Everyone levels by solo questing

This is why us old curmudgeons tend to rag on newer MMOs that lack so many of the features from classic MMOs. GW2 is bringing several of those old ideas back

Our group was in a old mine shaft searching for the cousin of one of our party members. We had encountered some Kobolds and had a feeling we would encounter more.

We came to a room with a giant tunnel and 3separate mine tracks going into the darkness. The group started to argue on what to do

As soon as that happen our Elven Ranger, rogue and some undead guy. 

As we are traveling mine carts start to surround me on the tracks.  I am on the right track and I have one in Front of me and 3 directly beside me on the middle track as they used their brakes to come up beside me. All of the carts are filled with Kobolds and their lizard type mounts. This is a bad news bears situation.

I won't bore you with the details that do not matter, but just in different carts due to some pretty stupid jumping around. Let me use this diagram to help. 

* ME - the mine cart I am in with 4 Kobolds
* P - the party of the cleric and artificer.
* ER - the Eleven Ranger in a cart(she has been throwing hammers she picked up at the Kobolds)
* K - any cart with just Kobolds in it. 
* NC - no carts at all

-------ER----------

----ME---P---K---K

----NC----NC-----

I decided to try something a bit crazy due to my current high strength and athletics. I jam a rusted sword I had under the cart I am in to try and cause the cart to flip to help my group. It was a great success. I rolled a natural 20. The cart flips. I then roll a strength check to see if I can hold onto the cart.  I pull it off with an 18. 

Our DM now has to roll to see what happens to the cart. He rolls a 1. The cart sails OVER the party and lands onto the first Kobolds. As this is happening I roll an Athletics check and bam

The DM now rolls to see how much damage this flying Kobold cart cause and he rolls a crit

This was my first real act of desperation as I was really beat down by being by myself for the first half of the battle. I was pumped this turned out so well

1373636240.0,1i5h05,[Pathfinder] The characters from the ongoing story,Mnementh2230,30,7,1,"The four characters in the [hobgoblin-war story I'm telling](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1i0jc4/pathfinder_the_beginnings_of_my_partys_troubles/) are as follows;

**Mike** - a halfling monk.  Mike grew up on an island between the northern continent of Avistan and the southern continent of Garund - world map [here](http://www.pathfinderwiki.com/mediawiki/images/a/a3/Golarion_world_map.jpg).  His parents were monks and protectors of the small village, killed Mike's parents and took most of the rest of the villagers as prisoners back to the main land.  Mike has rudimentary knowledge of the martial skills which are his heritage, but has had little opportunity to practice in anything other than mental battle.  His deft, small hands saw him apprenticed to a potter and set to work making small clay vessels for his hobgoblin masters - after all, every slave must work for food.

Mike, and is learning how to use his size to his advantage in combat (read:  becoming an [Underfoot Adept](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling/underfoot-adept-monk-halfling) monk archetype).  Mike is played by my wife.

**Ashok** - a half-orc cleric of Torag.  Ashok's parents are an unknown to him, and as such has lived a mostly solitary life.  His strong frame made him a natural blacksmith, and the solitary nature of the work appealed to him (never mind its value to the society).  He was provided books and reading materiel from his ""master"" (not that said master was much of a smith himself, or literate), among which was a book titled ""Hammer and Tongs"" - the holy book of [Torag](http://www.pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Torag).  Reading this, Ashok began to secretly worship Torag, the dwarven god.  Seeing as how there are so few dwarves left in the world, an upside-down hammer.

Ashok is the closest thing the party has to a true tank, and wields a heavy warhammer which he also uses as a holy symbol and the favored weapon of his god.  Ashok is very introspective (high wisdom) and is played by my brother.

**Reirret Hsiri** - a gnome barbarian.  He was captured as a young adult while adventuring, the HobBoss gave him the dubious pleasure of being a gladiatorial slave.  While he spends most of his time as a normal labor slave with everyone else, he's regularly outfitted and made to fight for the amusement of the HobBoss. Occasionally, he's allowed to take a piece of hide from the losers and add it to his patchwork armor--the only piece of equipment he's allowed to keep when not fighting.  He has magenta hair and lime-green eyes.

Reirret wears nasty patch-work armor made from the uncured hides of the foes he beats in battle.  It smells a bit like goblin dog

**Ceal Gladestone** - an elven mage.  Ceal grew up on the southern continent with a clan of desert-dwelling elves.  He joined the army intent on helping rid the world of the hobgoblin hordes and protecting his homeland

Ceal stays back in combat and casts his favorite cantrip, and flees from any sort of physical combat, preferring to let the more physically apt members of the party do the up-close killing.  He managed to recover his spell-book during the escape from the town, so he's not completely helpless.

Oasis 4v4. 

I am the HUNS, Britons.

Enemies: Franks, I don't remember the fourth guy.

I am in the bottom right corner of the map, berries and wood. I scout out the nearest enemy and resources. My scout gets brutally murdered in an ambush. I vow vengeance. The Aztecs. For centuries our people have feuded. But today, I would extinguish them from the planet.

I decide to Drush or Dark Age Rush 3 Militia to disrupt his economy. I killed several peasants

He quickly techs to the castle age, and once again the Huns are warriors without a home wandering the frigid cold. His allies begin pushing through my base, establishing a forward position. The Mongols ride hard and furious and begin pushing the line forward with the help of Red's Longbowman battalions. I manage to tech to Castle age in the rout. 

I build a Town center behind the Mongols and start pumping peasants, miners, lumberjacks. I started pump horse archers, upgrading my army, and deploying trade carts to all my allies. On the Norther Frontier the Teutons were holding the line with heavy walls and fortifications. I went from bottom score to third. The Mongols calvary, British archers and my Hun Archer and Hussar army succeeded in forced the Aztecs and their allies out of my old base. I went from 2 buildings and the brink of defeat to fielding a powerful 200 strong army. 

It was time to consolidate our troops and take the offensive. We began constructing forward operating bases of Castles and military structures and pushing into Aztec territory. I deployed an army of 60 Hussars behind enemy lines to disrupt their trade and economy. The Teutons maintained defensive positions in the North why the 3 of use began pushing the Eastern front. Little by little we gained ground. My score kept climbing. The Mongol Horde kept advancing

Right to it. This happened last to my character last night and I've spent all day today dressed in a bathrobe as emotional compensation. I felt I had to share. 4th edition by the by.

As a bit of ideological context, shallow and juvenille characters who aren't well known for their ability to operate with tolerance and/or a moderate sense of morality. A good example of this is recently when the office of 'warden of Fallcrest' was up for grabs via democratic election three of the six members of this group ran against one another, sabotaged one another's campaign, and all ended up inadvertently imprisoning eachother. The position of warden went on to be won (while the original three candidates were in prison) by the fourth candidate put forward by two other members of the group: a horse named Dick Van Dyke.

The He-Mann-Woman-Haters-Club (the tolerant name of said juvenille group, consisting of a Dragonborn Paladin (Donar K'Bib), a human wizard (Chevy Firebrand), a Dwarven fighter (Gynix Youthkind), an Elven rogue (William Castille of South Gillford) and two Tieflings (they're sort of the heart of this story) - a Bard name Littlehorn Lana, and a Warlock named Uncle Creepy. Lana's an independent lesbian with a russian accent, Uncle Creepy is a smooth-talking misogynist with a goatee so there's tension. I'm playing Lana. Whatever

The six of us entered a large chamber with an enormous, and we were about 60ft up from the lowest plane and decided it would be a good idea to lower Castille down via a rope to the lowest plane and in doing so bypass the stairs completely. We had a strong inkling the stairs were trapped. In theory, lowering him seemed a fine solution but Gynix was lowering Castille at a very slow rate, and while he was doing so red-eyed fucking gargoyles were swooping down and attacking the dwarf. Littlehorn Lana started assisting Gynix in lowering Castille but eventually the Elf lost patience and with a flambuoyant flick of his hand, used a daily to teleport to the lowest plane with Chevvy. Chevvy the wizard had, of course, flown down already.

That's when they too started getting swooped by gargoyles but in true HMWHC fashion, was less than patient. Creepy swept down the two flights of stairs, and in doing so was caught in the lower flight's trap - a brief crunching noise and the tiefling's feet were grabbed by rotating steps, which then fell to the right, forming a slight slope - toward the bottomless pit. Uncle slides toward the abyssal drop trying to grab onto something - he can't. Our DM says Creepy starts falling at a rate of 10ft per turn. Basically that meant we would have two turns before he vanishes out of sight. The turns are Chevvy's and Lana's. 


Now Chevvy can't do shit because his powers are good for burning down houses and minor agitation, and ties the other end around her waist. She can't let the only other Tiefling die, no matter how many verbal blows they've traded about group's misogynist overtones. She fires said arrow into his chest, which is kinda counter intuitive at first glance. However once the arrow sticks into Creepy's chest the rope goes taut almost immediately. Now Lana's not a beefy character, she's lissome and acrobatic and all that other impractical stuff so in a heroic effort (Gynix and K'Bib being too far away fighting gargoyles to lend any real strength) she leaps toward the lowest plane where Chevvy and Castille are, hoping to use the ledge of that plane as a kind of fulcrum/leverage point. I roll terribly and Lana simply slips into the pitt. Fucking whoops. 

Now both Tieflings are falling headlong toward death, which he then uses to lasso Littlehorn Lana mid plummet. He throws the other end to Gynix the Dwarf, who's essentially got a body built of steak, sweat and muscle so it's assumed Gynix has the strength to pull both up. Gynix, with both Lana and Creepy connected by rope to his waist, discovers a tad too late he actually doesn't have the strength to pull both up, rolls terribly and is summarily dragged into the bottomless pit. So uncle Creepy, is connected via arrow-rope to Lana

This is the first time the HMWHC go out of their way to be selfless and assist one another and it's getting half the group killed. That's when I remember that Lana has a power called 'shout of triumph' which generates a shockwave pushing friends and foes in all directions. Lana yells to Gynix to curl up into the foetal position. Not entirely necessary but humourous. Lana then decisively cuts the rope between her and the Dwarf and proceeds to let out a big

Now

But this session, all misogyny and casual prejudice is overlooked and they say ""Looks like there is love in the pit after all"" right before they fall to their deaths together.

1369089973.0,1eq47o,[D&amp;D 4e] The turning of the Rat Shifter (Part 1),Procks1061,26,3,3,"Hi all

**Background:** Our group consists of myself Nohrai Shieldbreaker a Dwarf Warlord (&amp; Blacksmith)

Last night was our second adventure as a party so far and we've really started warping our DM's original plans with some excellent creativity and ingenuity for all players. Which for mostly new players I'm very proud of.

**The Story:** As we join our group of three adventurers on the second day of their questing we find them working to recruit a plumber to help repair the temple the just liberated from a squatting halfling rogue. The group had to go down to the sewers take care of some beasties and some eerie operatic singing before the plumbers could finish their job for the city and move on to the temple.

Our party has just stepped down the ladder and entered the main cistern of the sewer. After lighting up the area we find a naked man with but a lute and a rapier lying down at the back of the area (Tau). While investigating a new individual a few rat hoards descend on us in silence. 

We work to squash them all when suddenly a slime crawls out from the pit and begins to trash at us with slimy acidic tentacles. Our new naked acquaintance is heavily slimed and begins suffering from acid burns everywhere. Yolo summons some water. With the only container in site being the bards loot. Tau pours the water out to wash the acid off as we finish off the slime beast.

After recovering and tending to everyone’s acid burns and rat bites. We have a quick look around the corner to see where the operatic singing is coming from.

From the darkness we here ""Take one more step or say another word I will slay you where you stand"". Nohrai attempts to converse with the individual

After a few limited lines of dialogue we find out that the individual is Selmic

Selmic isn't too sure of the idea and seems particularly fearful of the current state of the moon. We figure out he's a shifter (and very much likely supposed to be our first solo boss). We offer to take him to the temple we restored which out of sheer coincidence is the temple of Selûne (the goddess of the moon). However

We offer to build him a costume so he can hide and perform in plain sight without the fear of persecution from the general public. We needed to get some clothes for Tau anyway.

We come back up out of the sewers with a naked man and the site foreman and the city plumbers give us a weird look. We tell them we just need to get a few things and be back shortly

We go to the tailor in the city and get Tau some clothes and some supplies for the costume and go about tailoring a coat

We return to Selmic and offer him the costume. He attempts to put it on a fails miserably

Nohrai holds up his axe so Selmic can see; apprehensively he takes a look and is satisfied with the costume. It's late afternoon by now and we climb up the ladder to meet the plumbers. After coming up with another strange individual the plumbers are as confused as ever but we tell them that the sewer are safe and the music is gone. They agree to finish the job for the city and then head over to the temple.

We take Selmic with us over to the temple of Selûne and have the cleric sisters look him over. They agree it's a case similar to lycanthropy

That night they perform the ritual and Selmic is cured of his curse and ready to pursue his career of being an operatic singer for the realm.

Where we left off before, I made a quick decision to explore the werewolf's entrance into our stronghold as my exit. With some good rolls I blew away the zombies blocking my way with my deer rifle and fled through the broken barricade before the others could get to me, reloading as I ran. 

Outside, hell no we aint.

Yet we go to the graveyard anyhow, but she is almost immediately grabbed again. Grabbing the arm of one of the male teenagers, I scream ""There's no time!"" and drag him towards the wall at the other end of the graveyard, leaving the girl and her boyfriend to their fates.

With my teenaged diversion drawing all the attention of the oncoming zombies it was easy for my helper to boost me up onto the wall. I turned to help him climb up as well, to red, to black. I dropped the teenager who had helped my escape and fell backwards off of the wall, unconscious by the time I hit the ground.

**Story starts here...**

Journal of Tisk Tall’in of the world Dorin

Centaxday

I knew pretty quickly that this run would be difficult.  We had been contracted out by the remnants of an Imperial Navy fleet to find Brinmore Ortease and his cargo.  Ortease is a human smuggler that aligned himself with the Yuuzhan Vong insurgence

We travelled from Bastion, and settled in real nice.  Would be hard to find, the planet’s off the hyperspace routes and doesn’t show up on too many star maps.  But he underestimates the Autumn Shadow, and me.  Once we set adrift in Wild Space, it wasn’t long until we found the planet.  I radioed down for landing coordinates and received no response.  As I made my way into the atmosphere, I quickly understood why.  There were no space ports, no landing strips

I landed the Autumn in a field of rolling hills, as the locals call it, is a small, mostly unknown world just under a parsec into Wild Space, and outsiders are not necessarily welcome.  From what we could know, the planet is mostly populated by humans, with a few non-human refugees running around, with simple ground based transportation and very few modern luxuries like food synthesizers and land-speeders.  We walked up a hill to the west of my ship

As we crested the hill, his Tuskan ramblings can wear me down so quickly.  We continued on our way on foot.

It was not very long before we were among the populace; we quickly found what we were searching for, a slow moving land-based transport that drives on paved roads.  The barkeep called a taxi for us, and it arrived shortly.  The driver hesitated when he saw the three of us.  For a moment he appeared to consider driving off without us, but the lure of a good fare was enough, and he nervously let us in.    Killön told him the location of the warehouse and we set off.  

A few minutes later, facing the road, appeared to be some sort of docking area.  There were three massive ground vehicles picking up and dropping off large crates, and three other large openings on the wall, where I presume additional vehicles could load and unload cargo.    On the east side, there was an attached office building; the west side overlooked a large plot of paved ground, littered with a few dozen vehicles resembling the taxi we had arrived in.  The west side itself had a single entrance up a short flight of stairs.  The south side appeared to have two more entrances.  When we returned to the north side, barking and shouting in his native Tuskan language… such a terrible noise.  Killön and I waited like usual

1369097589.0,1eqe7c,[Pathfinder] Three farmboys head out into the world. [Minor NSFW],nerdyogre254,32,10,12,"This is the diary entry I wrote for my character for the first session of a new campaign for Pathfinder. I'll apologise in advance for the tags which explain some of the shops we went into that we didn't write the names down for.

Where to begin? It was a Thursday. I had just finished my chores for the day – lessons with Father Volurn (discussing the implications of the Starstone on mortal society and the impacts that it creates). I was done mid-afternoon and after doing some minor things for the family I settled in at the tavern for a drink or two.

I’m not sure which alarm I heard first – the fire alarm or the raid alarm. Callum, I drew my bow and swiftly moved to the alleyway.
I was rewarded by my haste with a close encounter with goblin weaponry and my fool companion’s arrow through my back

I woke shortly after to Zazas pulling his arrow from my back and patching me up. We headed back to the centre of town and helped put out the remaining fires
The next morning, because of the banners. I only recognized a few names, but any I did told a story – he was a veteran. The town council was there, too.

They told us that we would be tracking the goblins back to wherever they came from, then we were to take message of this to the capital so that reinforcements could be sent to our aid.

So off we set, and I the amateur defender of the faith.
Tracking was firmly in Zazas’s bailiwick, which led us up into the wooded foothills to the northwest of our home. 
As we passed through the woods, although we were all startled. With the knowledge that we were nearing the den of the goblins, we moved far more cautiously, a move which saved us a great deal of grief. As we pushed forward, I noticed that a section of ground had been dug up – sure sign of another trap. As we carefully dug away at it, we found several vials of what would later be determined as alchemist’s fire.

At this point, we would leave and call for reinforcements.

And that’s when the orc spotted us.

The ensuing battle was a challenge, as almost the entirety of the opposing force was shattered on his lance.

We were hurting, weapons, trinkets, enough to sell to provide for our home for years. It was not without risk – Zazas discovered what Callum knew to be a nest of hydra, and with this in mind we carefully withdrew from the cave and trekked to Silverwater.

We stopped at the Silverlight Inn for the night
The day afterward, saw us through the gates after a near-interminable wait.
Winding our way through the city

Entering the shop, the bookkeeper of the jeweller, by the name of Josephine. We handled our business – a stunning one hundred and ninety gold pieces, handled to us in platinum pieces – platinum! And the final crowning gift of it was, on the back of the receipt, an invitation to a dinner party with the lovely Josephine and some others.
If my father could see me, and a clarification on a cloak we picked up – demonhide. And I’d been wearing it for the last few days.

New armor was the next thing we needed, and several arrows for Zazas, and we were on our way.
A short stop at the baths rounded out our preparations for the night

The villa in question could’ve housed dozens of people at home, I noticed an unusual symbol on Josephine’s back – three daggers, pointing outwards from a circle.

She was a servant of Calistria.

We might be in trouble.

Sadly, followed by a break in the drawing room, and back for dessert. After this, three of the men and four of the women departed, leaving the three of us with Josephine, Rebecca and Haley.

And before we knew it

Shit.

The next few days, according to Calistrian doctrine, basically in an exclusive ‘relationship’ with these women. When I pushed the matter, on the last day of our stay, they told us that in the creation of this ‘bond’ they had pledged their services to ours until the end of days. Worryingly enough, the three of them were a witches coven.

So now we’re heading to the capital

Anyways.... To give a quick summary of this mod

Before I go any further

So I side with Dagoth Ur, The Heart of Lorkhan is an ancient relic that Dagoth Ur merged himself with to become a god. Essentially, by merging with the Heart of Lorkhan as well, you too become a god.

After merging with the Heart of Lorkhan

Once they were gathered, and bring The Ministry of Truth crashing down onto Vivec's Temple. I went forth and fulfilled the task, beating Vivec in one-on-one combat whilst using my godly powers. Afterwords I took Wraithguard, and casted a powerful spell that sent the Ministry of Truth crashing into his temple, leaving the entirety of Vivec in waste and ruin.

I returned to Dagoth Ur with Wraithguard, where we would rule side by side...... The problem was, I wanted Morrowind all for myself.

I knew there was no way I could feasibly defeat Dagoth Ur, because the heart made me just as powerful as him.

So I took to my Ash Vampire form, his health would be regenerated by the power of the heart, and the same would happen to me every time he delivered a blow. Eventually I was able to drive him from the bridge and onto the heart's alter. Slowly but surely, Dagoth Ur kept falling back farther and farther, until he was standing on the edge of a cliff. Then with one final blow, I sent Dagoth Ur falling into the fiery pit below.

Now, and the heart restored his health just as quickly as the lava took it. Dagoth Ur's own godhood had become his downfall, as he was now damned to bathe in molten hot lava for all eternity, and would never be granted the luxury of Death's sweet embrace. I then committed the final ritual on the Heart of Lorkhan and took control of Morrowind. From that day forth, the Sixth House was no more. Instead, it was the Seventh House. The Great House of Dagoth Nerevar.

D&amp;D. One day a buddy of mine approached us and asks if we’re interested in a campaign, a female elf barbarian (barbarianess?)

A couple of sessions in, our rogue snuck in the upstairs window and uncovered some important documents we needed. Fight breaks out. We’re scrambling to swing swords and great hammers in the confines of the tiny shop, the rogue comes at them from behind from their own stairway, Astrianna is trying not to nuke her own party. The cleric declares this place a hotbed of sin and an affront to honest businessmen, so he (with the DM’s permission plus a really good roll) uses the “dwarven secrets of flame and stone” and sets the building on fire. And then comes back around to the front entrance to (a) help us fight, and (b) make sure none of the smugglers escape.
The DM comes up with an on-the-fly method to simulate the fire spreading, to cover everyone’s escape, and hold my shield up in a defensive stance. Astrianna had a better idea.

She calls up a Wall of Water, they can swim through it just fine.

Every single one of them fails. They’re trapped inside the Wall. We could have just left them there. But no. *Astrianna had a better idea.*

My wife gets this manic look in her eye and shoots a lightning spell into the Wall, left to burn with their shop.

A session or two later, so I disregarded that as an option. We decide to do this kick-in-the-door style. Barbarianess and cleric get highest initiative rolls and charge, only to be immediately swarmed by orcs. 

Then it’s Astrianna’s turn. One of her favorite spells is a burst

There’s a moment of silence as the table considers what’s about to happen. Two PCs and seven enemy orcs

Our party is fighting a gnoll deathknight, and had unwittingly sent us up against an enemy just a tad too strong for us. Most of us needed a 16-17 just to hit, meaning over 3/4 of our attacks weren't connecting. On top of that, it could teleport, making flanking nigh-impossible.

We had one thing going for us: I was playing a human invoker, after 4 turns they would have 20 points of shield. Coupling that with the fact that the gnoll had extremely limited AoE abilities, and could typically only attack one person per turn, and we suddenly had a situation where, while we couldn't damage it, it simultaneously couldn't damage us.

After two hours we finally got the thing to half health; the DM said ""screw it"" and had the gnoll trip on its sword and die. It was a cop-out

We are in a city (name forgotten and will be referred to as The Town) on Tatooine which is controlled by a Mandalorian leader named Canderous Ordo, while another party member is a member of the local town Council of Lords and head of a smuggling organization disguised as a mercenary company.The party has discovered the location of 3 secret weapon caches owned by Canderous Ordo and has decided to raid the caches to arm the Tuskens and prepare to take the town. There are 2 weapon caches in The Town hidden in lightly guarded underground bunkers and 1 in a heavily fortified fort in the desert.

The party consists of:

Podo - an old

Chipper - A ex-mercenary human and expert marksman. He has political ties to the council of lords

Ki Cross - An ex-Jedi leader of a smuggling organization in The Town and master with of lightsaber. He was, the Mandalorian military leader of The Town.

Edam Ur - An ex-Jedi affiliated with Ki's smuggling business and with The Deatheaters

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The party decided to have Podo send the warriors of the Tusken clan to assault and raid the fort, driving their transport.

Chipper destroyed the camera outside and entered the bunker, he climbed onto the top of some shelving, remaining undetected by the handful of guards nearby, and took stock of the layout of the large room before him.

Meanwhile
The officer replied
Edam handed him the falsified papers given to him by Ki and awaited a response. The officer looked them over and then said
""I'm parked legally
""I'm just following orders sir,"" the officer replied with lassitude.
Edam, ""Listen here son, I've not broken any laws here. I'm not causing trouble. I'm in my damn pajamas, for god's sake. I didn't fight in the Mandalorian Wars so some shitheaded prick of a traffic cop could hassle me over curfew regulations as I pass through this shithole town. Now you ask me to get out of this truck and walk you back to look at the food crates stored in the back? If I get out of this truck, it will be to kick your skinny little ass!""
The guard
Edam looked him angrily in the eye and said ""Get out of my face

Podo and Ki entered their bunker and took a turbo lift down to their underground warehouse and neutralized the guard manning the security station. They entered the warehouse and began checking the weapons crates stacked on the shelves when they heard a commotion on the far end of the warehouse.

Chipper saw from his perch on top of the shelves that the two bunkers were connected and that Podo and Ki had just entered on the far side of the room. He climbed down the shelving and looked for a way to deal with the nearby guards. Finding a crate of grenades, and prepared to arm and throw them into the group of men. He flubbed the throw and they landed too close to him to avoid and exploded, sending him backwards into the shelving and wounding him. The explosion killed all but two of the guards. Chipper drew his blaster and shot the first in the forehead, dropped to a knee and shot the second in his chest. He yelled across to Podo and Ki, who had come to investigate the commotion, and they began to carry the weapons crates up to the waiting trucks which had both pulled up to the building Chipper had entered.

They finished loading the trucks with an hour left before dawn

A short while on the road and they saw ahead a commotion. Security forces had set up a crime scene on the side of the road. As they drove past both drivers looked and saw the crime scene was set up around two corpses with ritualistic symbols carved into every inch of visible skin. Kragg
""Permits
Ki handed him the permits and said
""Nevermind my night
Ki shot the officer a genial smile and replied, I helped write them after all. We have some supplies urgently needed by the Tuskens and we need to get it out there as soon as possible. Just trying to be the first out of the gate.""

While this conversation was happening, noticied the security officer near him was a commander by the name of Hexx, second in command to Canderous Ordo and a person with whom the party had interacted with in the past. She noticed the stopped truck ahead and began to walk slowly towards his window.

""I understand your position, you make it worth my while and I'll forget I saw you this evening.""
Ki sighed and dropped a thousand credits into his hand
""-embezzling from the council too,"" the guard drawled.
Grumbling

As commander Hexx reached the truck door

When the trucks were halfway to the gates, who was standing in the box compartment lashed to the wall. He smiled at the security officer as he fired the rocket launcher on the pursuing cruiser. As the cruiser exploded behind the truck, Edam let out a hearty laugh and took a swig of his jug, belching afterwards.

After the encounter with the Security cruiser

Chipper looked about the weapons boxes to find a way to deal with the dozen or so cruisers pursuing them. He spied some energy cells strapped to the wall and kicked at the strap securing them. They broke away and went bouncing into the midst of the cruisers. He fired his blaster at one a caused it to explode setting off a chain reaction scattering or destroying the pursuing cruisers and causing a massive amount of collateral damage to the surrounding buildings.

They approached the gates which had just opened for the day and began to speed up even further. A guard ran into the gatehouse and seconds later the gates began to slowly draw to a close.
""Strap in
Chipper, swinging on his life line into the space between the trucks. He steadied himself against the side of truck and fired a rocket at the gate ahead. The rocket exploded and badly damaged, but didn't destroy, the gate.

Ki's truck slipped through the gate

Two speeders pulled out from the gatehouse in fast pursuit of the trucks. One pulled up alongside the cab of Ki's truck and began motioning to Ki to pull over to the side of the road. He then dropped behind the truck and fired a warning shot past Ki's cab. The second speeder pulled alongside the docking plate and Chipper and pointed his sawed off blaster at him. Chipper leaped from the docking plate towards the speeder, and shot the man from the vehicle. He then pulled to the lead of the convoy and the three vehicles sped off into the desert.

According to Steam, with two different builds: a fire-wielding mathemagician, and a counter-based sword wielding vampire. Every time I have come close to beating the game, I have become overconfident or inattentive, and made a really silly mistake which ended up killing me, like walking into my own stacked firewalls, immediately killing me.

This story, my closest-to-victory, and most embarrassing death. This is the tale of Nosferatu VI - the sixth generation of a long line of vampire fencers, of which he was the most successful to date, yet still considered the black sheep of the family.

The success of my vampire-build, which means that you'd have to stack magic skill trees (which consist primarily of ranged attacks and (de)buffs) and magic equipment (which usually provides poor stats to surviving melee) for it to be effective, while for vampirism to work leech life and add extra damage you need to make melee attacks - which effectively means that vampirism used to be a sure-fire way to gimp your build.

In recent versions, since vampires can't regenerate health naturally - thus giving that stat a purpose for vampires as well. I was able to make a vampire build that had defensive skills that would passively boost my health regen to extreme values, as well as other nice defensive stats. Coupled with whatever health regen equipment I could come across, this made me leech life in combat faster than I could lose it. Here's an overview of the seven skill trees in my build, and for what reasons I picked them:

UTILITY SKILLS

* **[Vampirism](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Vampirism)**: The defining skill tree of my build, only the first two skills were on any use to me, and thus the defining skill tree of my build, would be the last one to max.

* **[Burglary](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Burglary)**: Lots of useful utility skills, invisibility and teleportation.

OFFENSIVE SKILLS

* **[Swords](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Swords_(Skill)**: Increasing my damage with swords, and probably most importantly substantially increasing my counter-attack chance (counter attacks will negate an enemy attack, and instead giving you a free attack, which basically makes it one of the most potent forms of defence).

* **[Dual Wielding](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Dual_Wielding)**: Again, when using two swords, instead of just one, you'll get the stat bonuses from the Swords skill tree applied twice, which means even *more* counter-attack chance.

* **[Berserker Rage](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Berserker_Rage)**: Somewhat of a filler, the first level skill (which is free) was quite nice.

DEFENSIVE SKILLS

* **[Shield Bearer](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Shield_Bearer)**: Funnily enough, and I'd vastly prefer a higher counter-attack chance than a higher block chance. The only reason I got it was for the two skills that can each boost my Health Regen by four - one of them a proc-buff, and the other an activated cooldown-buff.

* **[Master of Arms](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Master_of_Arms)**: Same as Shield Bearer - a cooldown-buff adding +4 to health regen, I'd be a vampiric powerhouse.

It didn't take long for my character to become nigh-unstoppable, due to my very high counter attack chance, and my ability to easily recoup any health lost, without the expense of any resources. There were only four real dangers for me, three to my life, and one to my equipment, but even those weren't that bad: ranged/caster monsters, taking their shots as I'd advance; construct/undead monsters, and most traps' damage is based off of your Magic Power, which can corrupt/curse your equipment - though I could deal with them by locking them in place with the Lockup skill from Burglary

I was finally near the end of the game, so I decided to treck upwards again, to use any Lutefisk Statues I had left unused, and enter any Mysterious Portals I had found (Mysterious Portals transport you to a short level, where all the monsters are randomly pulled from various floors of the game, which make them ill advised to do early in the game, but mostly trivial by the end), to enter some Wizardlands and get that last bit of experience to max out my build.

Everything went smoothly. I had achieved my max level, Lord Dredmor himself. I went back down to level 14. I was just about to go down into the final floor of the game, the only floor I had not yet seen in the game, when curiosity struck me: the last skill I had acquired was the last skill in the Vampirism skill tree - a skill tree I had never completed before, and thus I had never tried that last skill, Transylvation. I figured, why not just try it out - I had cleared the floor anyway

Now, altering your stats (less attack and defense, but much higher sneak and evade), disallowing the use of your skills, and finally the ability to fly, and thus the ability to cross water or lava. It only lasts 20 turns, after which you polymorph back to your regular form.

I was flying around, inaccessible until I got teleportation somewhere mid-game, and which were loaded with artifacts and treasure, were now more accessible than ever! I was a happy as a bat can be!

Then I started to wonder. I wonder what would happen if I ceased being a bat, since I had previously tried teleporting onto tiles of water, with a random teleport skill from another skill not in this build, and there had been no consequence, besides being stuck until you teleported again. I felt confident that no harm would come to me, but I needed to sate my curiosity. After all, what could happen?

The timer of my polymorph ran up. I could see the transformation happening. Scaly wings withered away

So, and Tabu enter Galley, having followed Franz's massive footprints to the edge of town. Galley is a marketplace, basically a large ring of buildings surrounding a central brick area containing three large pillars, which are used to display city messages.

The three look around, let's try thees... EXCUSE ME, BUT HEZ ANYVODY SEEN A BEEG GUY RUNNING THROUGH HERE? LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TO BREK SOMETHINK?!"". 

The exclamation catches the attention of a few random citizens. One saunters up to them. ""Why, i think.... let me check my note book..."" He proceeds to pull out a notebook, and thumbs through the pages, relating to use that he did witness a giant, but he has no idea where he went. Spetrovi is annoyed, and walks away midsentence, with the others in tow. as he is walking away, sending the man into a freaked panic about demons or something of that nature.

The group splits to inspect the three pillars, you drunk?"" ""whhatever, you manached to loose a pucking giant""), Tabu's mini-me notices something strange: nobody's moving. The adventures look around them to see that time has literally stopped in its tracks. Throzgar disdainfully acknowledges that this ""must be some more of that magic bullshit"", and Spetrovi decides to do an experiment.

 He uses mage hand to pull a piece of banner off of one of the towers. To his surprise, and reads the inscription aloud: ""speak friend, and enter"".

Immediately, and spetrovi forgets the elvish word for friend. oops. After more failed attempts to make something happen, i leave my chair and sprint downstairs to ask Airde's player what the word is. I return upstairs and shout ""MELONS!"" at the DM. after some debating, i determine that he wants the word used in the movie, which was bellock or some such word. 

""Ballsack!, Bellock!"" The letters on the towers glow, and we begin to sink into the ground.

We find ourselves in a cave system, making him the same height as the two halflings, we head off down the  cave to enter a concrete room.

At the far side sits a statue of a firebat, tabu realizes that he has a floating disk, and flies up to it. 

""alright, nothing happens. Spetrovi is getting damned tired of dead ends, and shoots a magic missile at the statue from across the room. Sure enough, the missile takes a chunk out of the statue, and it quickly spews a massive ring of fire, engulfing the mini-me. Throzgar throws a mighty blow with his axe to crack it, and Spetrovi finishes it off with another magic missile. 

Unfortunately for Throzgar, creating a massive firestorm all around him, setting him on fire and taking damage.

Spetrovi pulls out his potion of cure light wounds, which impacts his forehead and knocks him to the ground, setting the rest of him on fire. He scrambles to pick up the vial, and drinks it.

""YOU EEDIOT. YOU WERE SUPPOSET TO PUT YOURSELF OUT WITH EET."" Tabu realizes that he can do more than one thing with his disk, who is now being slowly cooked instead of burned.

spetrovi thinks for a second

Tabu lowers the disk to just above the bloodied giant's head. They count down, and throzgar gets a 19 on an acrobatics roll, which actually results in an 18 since he's -1. Still, it's enough to allow him to slingshot out of the ring of fire, and land on his feet in safety.

""Oh, which sends a massive wind across the chamber and instantly extinguishes the flames. ""WHY YOU NO DO THIS EARLIER?!"" ""whel, you got impatient.""

They proceed through the now revealed entrance. There is a long hallway with two guards in front of a large door. Throzgar begins charging towards the guards, and makes him remove his helmet, and headbut the wooden door as hard as possible. 19 roll. The guard cracks the massive door and falls unconscious. his concerned partner turns to help, only to be mindthrusted into oblivion.

Not wanting to slow his roll, pleading in front of a massive, heavily armored figure. To the figure's right, four mercenaries are barely holding franz down, one with a blade to his throat. four more guards sit on either side of the entrance with bows.

It's at this point that Airde and Dusk make an entrance, they begin the encounter.

Airde immediately throws down a fog, but not dead. It's at this point that Throzgar emerges from the fog, makes eye contact with BBEG, and witnesses him bitch slapping the matron across the room. ""TIME TO DIE, MUHHFUCKAH"", and he charges towards him. Franz sees Throzgar, and starts yelling at him to leave. The guards try to hold him down, leaving a small cut on Franz's neck. 

Suddenly, terrifying the guards, who release him promptly. Dusk, Spetrovi and Tabu begin attacking guards, while Throzgar begins attacking BBEG full force. Throzgar is outpowered, and is taking damage pretty quickly. Spetrovi erects a fountain of flame, setting the right half of the room on fire. The opportunity allows Franz to break free of his chains, whipping chains around and smashing guards one by one. The flames burn the rest of the guards on that side to a crisp

Who is totally getting his ass kicked. Several turns in, and has disarmed the BBEG. Tabu and Dusk finish off all but two of the guards, and spetrovi uses his mage hand to drop a wall torch into the armor of one of the remaining two. Tabu uses his disk to fan the flames, and they engulf and kill the remaining guards.

Franz is repeatedly attacking BBEG, ready to attack.

""oh good God. Crit 1."" BBEG winds up an uppercut, sending his helmet flying. Throzgar take the opportunity to toss his old scythe to franz. rolls a 2. BBEG catches scythe, and it cycles to his turn. The DM lets out a ""GOD DAMNIT. 2."". BBEG swings at franz, but franz uses his chains to break the scythe in 2, using his new weapon against BBEG.

After spending every ability the party has, and books it for the door. As Franz turns to follow, Throzgar embraces him, and yells ""BRROOOOOO"". Franz hands him the head, and a magical table with the same inscription as the one found in the previous encounter with the goblins, as well as the same map pulled out of the captured goblin's pocket.

Franz falls out of rage

We all return to the city, and gets some badass commie-colored robes for 50 gold. 

Tabu gets a letter from Throzgar to go check on a client, and is now terrified that the several hundred year old mage is going to destroy everyone. In his panic, he notices bengal, sitting on a bench. He attempts to detain him, but ziggsal simply escapes and leaves. Tabu goes to meet spetrovi and tell him what's up.

For those unfamiliar with the GURPS system

Our first attempt as this homebrew campaign lasted only 4 sessions heh. My buddy Jeff wanted to play a paladin/glitterboy mech warrior... So he basically took the wealth advantage and decided to buy a battle suit. Knowing Jeff to never play an OP character as actually being OP we all were perfectly fine with it despite the rest of us being quite weak in comparison. He essentially had a gauss rifle and a light sabre... Meanwhile my character was essentially a dog sized dragon who could turn into a human with the intelligence of a caveman. My other friend Ryan was a fire controller and Stephanie was a robot.

To give you insight into how powerful he was compared to the rest of us: most of us had DR10. He had DR70!

Well it was all good fun until we ran into the now infamous ""mind-control torso"" as we call him. Okay

Not having learned my lesson that in GURPS

That ended up being quite fun for a while when I raised space marines from the dead to shoot laser rifles as my minions. Things were not destined to work out very well for Dralnu or most of the rest of the new Rifts party though.

One day the party was going through an old abandoned university campus when a Rift opened up throughout the region. Dinosaurs started streaming through. Dralnu unfortunately had his leg bitten off as we crossed a flooding road by a shark. Quite hilarious!

It only got worse though. A T-rex ran up to us and ate both our space marine and our elf ranger (who had cybernetic implants :P). The rest of us managed to kill the dino before the space marine died

Dralnu's end eventually came as we encountered two people in rocket-launching mech-suits... Having only one leg Dralnu just had no ability to dodge those things and ended up being blown apart along with Jeff's second character

The farmer was fortunately saved by our other teammate who was a vampire... by making him into a vampire as well.

So the party has spent its first night free of captivity in the woods, with no fire and scarce little food.  They're cold, they're wet, but they're free.  The dwarf, in particular, who has been enslaved for the last several hundred years, is ecstatic.  As they begin planning out where they're going to go and what they're going to do, they hear the baying of goblin dogs:  the pursuit is on.

After a short distance running, and urges the party onwards, saying he'd rather die facing his captors than fleeing them.  It's a bittersweet moment for the half-orc cleric, who is losing the mentor he's had for a long time, but has only just met.  The party flees, and soon hears the sound of combat behind them as the dwarf roars his defiance.  He can't possibly win, but he can buy the party enough time to escape the whole of their pursuit.

Thus begins the chase scene, and avoiding ambushes by groups of goblins and hob-goblins who had fanned out ahead of the dogs.  The party is eventually run down by the dogs, but fights them and their goblin handlers, slaying them all while taking only light wounds.  

This has slowed them down enough that they eventually run in to the hobgoblin leading the hunt:  a taller-than-usual figure in masterwork half-plate very familiar to our half-orc cleric.  After watching his underlings go before him, mace and spell.  Removing the helm from their defeated foe, he was unfortunately the individual the cleric feared he would be:  the son of the regional governor.  The pursuit was over, however, so the party stripped off his armor in hopes of having the half-orc (the only member of the party who could go in to a town without being captured on sight) sell it for provisions at some point in the near future.  After a short discussion, they decided to head further south, following the rivers to the coast with the eventual goal of making it to the southern continent and freedom.

They set off south, they see a ship heading downstream.  The gnome and halfling recognize the hobgoblin at the prow of the ship as the governor of the town they escaped from, despite his visage being contorted with rage and grief.  They've made a mortal enemy who has abandoned his duties (hobgoblins are very militaristic) to seek them out and avenge the death of his son...

A fun gaming story

My group and I got off track during a session recently and got to reminiscing about some of our favorite adventures. One story came up a few times and I thought I’d share. The world is your standard high fantasy with elves and dwarves and magic and whatnot

Late one night a massive storm washes out the main bridge over the River Rye cutting the group’s home village off from much needed trade traffic. The flooding was enough to change the flow of the river and prevent a bridge from being rebuilt on the site. So the team - a dwarf engineer

They finally find a spot that is located just downstream from the outflow of a dark and murky swamp. (Note: never try to draw a swamp on your battlemap when one of players assesses wetland quality for a living. You think rules lawyers are bad? You don’t even know.) After a couple of days of work they finish the job but by now its too late to journey back to the village so they decide to camp for one more night and head back in the morning. They’d been hearing strange noises from the swamp for the last few nights and had been posting watches like good little gamers. But this night they hear roaring, but I digress. And there in the bushes was the cutest little troll baby they had ever seen.

The thief and the hunchback were all in favor of killing the thing where it laid and getting the hell out of there middle of the night or no. But the dwarf - who’s player can’t be bothered with meta-human stereotypes

Jump forward several weeks to the sleepy little town of Millbury on the Rye where the party lives and things are not going so well for our dwarf and it’s new pet. The thing is growing like a weed and eating through more food than our character can afford. Pretty soon peoples’ pets start disappearing and something has raided a neighbor’s chicken coop. Chaining the troll up works for about a day until it realizes it’s strong enough to just pull the chain out of the wall and head out the window. People around town are starting to talk about seeing a monstrous creature prowling around at night and there’s talk about forcing the town leaders to hire someone to hunt the thing down. It has

Our other characters are actively avoiding the dwarf and its charge at this point and quietly wondering how high a village imposed reward for the capture of the “monster” will go before they decide to turn the dwarf in to the authorities. Around this time a pretty young woman shows up in town and starts making friends with the thief and the wizard. She tells them she is thinking about leaving to look for work in the next town over because of the “monster” rumors. “And wouldn’t that be the most dreadful thing after she’s just getting to know all of these nice people.” (Can you see where this is going? Because my players couldn’t.) The thief - intrigued - decides to tail our young woman around town for a while and notices her flirting with several of the other tough guys in town and decides she’s just a working girl and leaves her alone. The hunchback though is entranced by this new beauty who is actually nice enough to talk to His Hideousness. He hangs around her long enough to realize she’s actively trying to agitate the good townsfolk into violence against whatever it is thats been eating their dogs and scaring their kids. As he’s trying to decide what to do about this someone bursts into the scene and says he just saw the monster run into the place where “that dwarf” lives. Our heroic hunchback trots on over to the dwarf’s residence just minutes before the crowd gets there waving pitchforks and torches and demanding blood. And just in case you were wondering

Inside the dwarf’s home they’re getting ready to try and have a reasonable discussion with a mob. This means throwing the troll out of a second story window (“Look at him he’s so cute how can I just throw him out the window?” “He’s a troll, and then putting on every piece of armor and every weapon you can fit on something 4.5 feet tall and 3 feet wide. They head to the front door and the hunchback opens the door so the dwarf can lumber out impressively...and then immediately shuts and locks it and watches from a window. By this point the young lady has got the crowd worked up to a fervor and they’re not about to listen to reason. The dwarf is denying that anything is living there, the woman is shouting that they should knock the dwarf down and search the house, the hunchback is looking for the back door and the thief is sniggering from the back of the crowd. The only thing keeping the mob from surging into the house is the fact several people are going to lose kneecaps before they can get past the dwarf.

Just as things are about to get really nasty someone screams from the edge of the crowd “There it is!” From the characters point of view it looks like a straight line of people being knocked down by something moving fast and folks on either side running away from whatever is trampling mob members. It’s clear that whatever it is heading straight for the pretty lady and the crowd surges away leaving her standing by herself. Into the sudden circle bursts the troll child who knuckles up to the lady at speed and bites her in the kneecap. She bats the troll aside with the back of her hand but it’s too late. The bite causes her to drop her magical disguise and she is revealed for the Bog Hag that she really is. A big, “Give me the troll child for my evil potion or this whole town will suffer.”

At this point the thief decides this isn’t so funny and tries to sneak up for the back stab. But the Hag senses him and he gets our incapacitated local lad thrown at him for his troubles. The dwarf and it’s (yes, “now they’ve gone and armed the damn thing.” The hunchback isn’t doing much good because a lot of people from the crowd are pressed up against the door of the house he’s in trying to stay away from a hag with a battleaxe. At this point things aren’t looking good for our team - especially the dwarf who’s about to have his/her head split open with his/her own battleaxe. Suddenly a cry that sounds a bit like Sloth from the Goonies yelling Mama (or Dada - that gender is none of my business) echoes from the darkness and an enraged troll child rushes out, makes a leap that would shame Pete Townshend and lands fangs first on the hag’s head. The hag’s attention goes to the troll just long enough for our Dwarf to pull a knife and stab her in the foot, the thief to pull a throwing blade and land it between her shoulder blades and the hunchback to finally get out the front door and cast a spell that sets her rags on fire.

While these blows weren’t enough to bring her down on their own, that troll just saved us from that hag!” And everyone starts cheering. The troll is found and given plenty of celebratory pats on the back and all the garbage he can eat and the crowd finally disperses with a whole new interesting tale to tell their children. Over the next few days it is generally agreed that having a tame troll around may not be bad for keeping the riff-raff out of town and could actually be something of a tourist draw. The expense of feeding and caring for it - of course - is left up to the dwarf.

And that’s the story of how an orphaned troll became the unwitting hero of the Village of Millbury on the Rye.

The Union Jack unfurled atop the Governors mansion, however. Word had arrived from London; we were to put together a force and seize the city of Savannah from the mongrel Cherokee. They were a nuisance to our cousins in America, and it would allow for a secure foothold on the continent. Ruperts Land was all well and good, but it was too far North to be put to actual use.

Of course all of this was grand for the King back home, light artillery, and a couple of infantry units. The final pieces of the puzzle were being assembled in Nassau, the preparations nearly complete.

No one in the Empire doubted the eventual success of the campaign. We would land, and we could move on to removing the French blight from the region. All noble goals, to be sure. It was the first move a grand campaign that would see us rise to knew heights. All were excited for the future.

With an officer now in command of the force they were ready to leave. The vessels set sail to the celebrations of the citizenry they left behind

The fleet stopped just off shore

The time had arrived. The boats hit the shore, setting out for the town at once. It was a short trip, and they immediately set siege to the beasts.

The commander, blood lust clearly directing their actions. Peace would not be the word of the day, it seemed. The commander gave the order, ""We attack at first dawn.""

The cannons sounded the new day. Roaring with an explosive passion, circling around the enemies line and moving to charge their rear. The infantry marched forward, muskets at the ready. The signal was given, and the dragoons charged at the rear of the enemy. The infantry fired almost simultaneously, both frenzying the already haphazard lines of the local defenders. It was a short battle.

The Jack was raised over the new colony, with construction of a new governors mansion beginning in their stead. This would surely be the new capital of the British America.

The force encountered little initial resistance, and moving directly towards them.

The commander met their gaze, and the fighting was fierce. It was going well initially, the natives had been split down the middle by a patch of woods, allowing for the dragoons to handle half of them. Things began to fall a part. A group of Cherokee launched from the woods, unseen in the chaos of battle. They smashed into the left flank of the advancing infantry, halting their forward momentum. Distracted, they couldn't defend themselves from the frontal assault by the Cherokee lines either. The commander and infantry were surrounded

The commander finally fell from his horse, they could go for help. Savannah would not fall!

But a group of cavalry and infantry came anyway. It was small, and attacked the exhausted remnants of the expeditionary force. 

Without numbers or infantry

It went off without a hitch. As the enemy force entered the city, but somehow the dragoons held tight. Time elapsed, and the last infantrymen fell to a dragoon musket ball. All that was left was the cavalry, and they couldn't get close enough to burn the buildings down without being shot. It was a stalemate. The clock ran down. The battle was ours. The battle would be taught for years to come in officer schools throughout the Empire, the Savannah Defense as it was known, would be the general strategy for dealing with overwhelming native odds. It was the only good thing from the campaign. 

With the success the small band of survivors fled the city. The fleet sat in wait, they would defend their homes. No news ever got back as to their fates. All that's known is they failed, and the Cherokees returned to Savannah.

The survivors called for revenge. They demanded retribution. The Empire was bored with America, and would learn from the mistakes made in the Cherokee campaign. They would go a totally different route in their next conquest. India would be ours.

&gt;It was a cool day in the Riverlands. It was going to rain today. Arimethea could feel it in his joints as he slowly walked up the hill toward his lord's hall.

The Maester had received word from a young servant boy that Lord Nodt requested his presence immediately. He thought back on his many years of service under Seamus Nodt. Ever since he met the man, never content on the status quo. 

So far, of the Lord’s plans had turned out in his favor. Even the lesser known ones, where the Lord had the Maester hire certain unsavory characters to carry out a variety of tasks. Luckily, Lord Nodt was a devout man. Arim was happy that he never had to dirty his hands aiding his master in assassinations. He had heard rumors back in the Citadel, of maesters getting caught up in every kind of troubles. In all his years, Arim never went looking for any unnecessary trouble, and it saw fit to never find him.

After a few more minutes of his slow ascent up the winding path that led up the hill, Arim was startled by a loud grunt from behind him and a large hand on his shoulder, ushering him to the side. He turned around to face a giant of a man, with bronze skin and ill-fitting clothes. 
“Ah, for such a large beast, you surely are quiet,” the Maester said to the man. All he received in a reply was another grunt as Kamir opened the door for Arim. “Many thanks, Kamir. I see my lessons are teaching you a few manners, at least.”

The Maester walked into the spacious hall with Kamir tailing him. The oaf of a man was somewhat of a friend of the Maester. He randomly rode into town one day, but the Maester offered him some food and drink and the horse rider has stuck around since. Arim was not sure whether he was dense or was simply a foreigner who did not speak the language. Nevertheless, it has been three years since the rider’s arrival, and the Maester had been giving him daily lessons in the ways of Westeros. He had little success, sadly. Kamir would frequently doze off during lessons, or simply walk away and wander off to the larder for a meal. Arim had taught the man a few words in the King’s Tongue, though, it was not all for naught.

Finally arriving at the Lord’s raised chair at the other end of the hall (though quite devout, “My lord, you requested my presence and I have come.”


“Ah, Hoster Tully. I would like you to read it,” the Lord said as he waved a servant over to give the letter to the frail Maester. 

Arim took the note from the servant and unrolled the parchment. Holding the letter close to his face and squinting his eyes

“*Lord Nodt, a banner lord of the Lannisters. As you can understand, the last thing anyone needs right now is a border war between two minor houses. As your liege lord, I command you to peacefully end any dispute between your two houses; otherwise, I will have to take action. I expect you to undertake this task post-haste,*” the Maester took a quick breath before adding, “signed by *‘Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, looking up towards his Lord, my lord? Perhaps we should send a small delegation and inform Lord Tir that we have no claims on any of his land?”

“I assumed you would go for the safest option, I wish to send you and my son.”

“In all of your years? Aren’t you only ten years my elder?” Cillian quipped back

“Ah

“I knew I made the right choice, right?”

“Aye

The two sparred for hours. Cillian was content with what he had learned today. He even considered picking up a proper sword sometime. As he walked back through town with Bedric

“Oof! Sorry

“Did he say what about?” Cillian asked.

Cillian took his time heading home, after he had finished perusing the various wares that the merchants were selling, Cillian finally decided to climb the hill and head to his father’s hall. 
After entering the hall, Cillian opened the door to his father’s chambers to find that he guessed right. His father was sitting behind his desk, opposite of Maester Arim and his savage, Kamir. All three towards the door, noting his arrival.

“I see you finally saw fit to grace us with your presence, “the Maester and I were just discussing the border dispute between us and House Tir.”
The Maester opened his mouth to speak
Cillian was taken aback for a moment before regaining his composure. “You realize I have absolutely no experience dealing with this kind of thing

“What better time to learn then now, the Maester will be there with you to help out if there’s any trouble.”

“I suppose

“You may be right, you set off immediately.”

“Immediately? But father-“

“Go

Cillian knew better than to argue with his stubborn father. He walked down the hall to his chambers and began gather what he would need for his travels, and a steel trident. “Better safe than sorry,” Cillian said to himself as he donned his armor.

An hour later, and Kamir, who decided to tag along, were all on horseback, riding southwest out of the city. Maester Arim had decided that they would travel directly to House Tir through the wetlands instead of taking the poor-excuse for a road that lead west out of town and far out of the way from their destination. After their first hour of travelling, Kamir spoke up with one of his favorite words, “Hungry.”

About 3 minutes passed before Chortle stood up, Chortle and Killön would come in guns blazing.  I started off to the side door while Chortle and Killön got into position at the northwest corner; I swear they were laughing at me.

Once I got to the door, easily cracked.  I peeled the cover of the keypad back, slowly as to not make a sound.  I pulled one of the wires inside and with a soft click I was in; no problem.  Slowly, I cracked the door open, pulling it out towards me.  I would have no luck this day; a large security guard, Dathomirian by the look of his horns, blocked my path forward. He had not noticed me, pulled my antiox mask off

My mask grazed his cheek and he was well aware of me now.  Almost instantly he turned

I was nowhere near out of danger by this point.  The security guard had pulled a crude pistol on me as he advanced out onto the small platform outside the warehouse.  I raised my energy shield into position, hoping that Chortle and Killön were faring better than me.

[Chortle later bragged to me, armed with some form of shock probe, which they delighted in poking and prodding Chortle with.  He must have been in some mad Tuskan rage, because rather than absorbing the energy from the probes, he simply stood there and took the shocks, then returned fire with his own flavor of electricity.  His force lightning lifted one guard off his feet and slammed him against an inactive forklift.  The other guard was not as incapacitated…

Killön had to explain the remaining events to me, he turned and saw one of the guards still standing as Chortle fell.  He dropped the launcher and aimed his blaster, hitting the guard square between the shoulders.]   

Knowing only of the explosions, and go whistling over my head.    Another shot from the guard rang out, hitting my shield square, breaking the energy bond at the cross section of the shield.  The projectile went through and made a quiet thud against my armor.  My trigger finger squeezed gently again in reaction; this time I hit the guard square in the chest.  As I watched him crumble to the floor, I took a few seconds to catch my breath and reclaim my thoughts.

I hurried into the warehouse to investigate the commotion.  Killön had now hopped onto one of the massive storage racks that filled the warehouse.  Several craters smoked in the warehouse floor, this one human, convulsing against a forklift.  This must have been the one on the bad end of Chortle's Lightning blast.  Several workbenches had been demolished, probably Chortle's work too, I can practically hear his maniacal laughter in my head.  None of the bodies are his, but they aren't Ortease either.

Suddenly, second shelf? It may have been less specific, maybe not even real words, but I made my way into the long rows of massive shelves.  Crates, upon crates, mostly 2 meters across, filled the racks.  Was Ortease really hiding among these crates?

As I approached the rear wall I thought I heard Chortle singing to himself, just over my head.  With a single, strong but graceful move he broke through a crate and pulled out Ortease, holding him by his neck.  He growled at Ortease, interrogating him about the whereabouts of the package.  With some hesitance I walked back through the carnage to find rope and plastic to bind Ortease together.  I found both, and followed the singing sound to find Chortle collapsed and exhausted, smoking a cigarette from underneath a dead guard with a blaster sear in his bag.   When I returned with the bindings and Chortle, crying to himself.  Yes, but I had stopped listening by now.

I wrapped up Ortease in rope and plastic and had Killön drag him to the front.  I grabbed the hard drive and Chortle sulked along behind.  As we made it to the front of the warehouse we heard distant sirens.  Killön threw Ortease into the cargo bay of the massive transport vehicle and I rushed to the driver’s compartment.  Feeling perhaps overconfident from my success with the keypad, sputter, and then vomit flames and black oil.  Something had gone wrong.  I shouted to the others and jumped from the vehicle as it slowly started to roll forward.  Killön jumped out with Ortease on his back and as we ran to the west side of the building where we had previously seen smaller vehicles.  Only a few remained and we chose what we assume was the fastest of the lot.  

Killön smashed two of the windows so we could climb in; Chortle smashed the others because that’s just what he does.  I climbed into the vehicle and attempted to hotwire it.  I failed, shame that he wasn’t…

Finally the vehicle purred into life.  I slammed my foot on one of the pedals and the vehicle surged forward as Killön jumped in.  As we headed for the main road, came barreling in.  The local police had finally arrived.  One came in too fast, and losing control crashed into the flaming transport vehicle.  The others swarmed around me as I attempted to escape.  Killön reached his long torso and arms out of the broken window and again drew his mini-launcher.  He fired at the police squad and blasted a crater in the ground flipping one of the vehicles on its side.  The others swerved out of the way and I had a lane out.  

I was extremely unimpressed by the speed of the vehicle we were in.  I shouldn’t have expected much since the taxi we arrived in was slower than a Hutt on sedatives.  The police were soon in pursuit again as we made it to a long highway.  After swerving several times, I continued to drive at full speed to get to the Autumn and get off this planet.  As we sped across the highway I imagined myself handing the hard-drive over to the Imperial Navy and receiving a handsome sum of credits.

I slammed the vehicle to a stop.  I looked back at Ortease and the lifeless Chortle.  Ortease smiled at me through his bindings… I left the hard-drive in the burning transport vehicle…",self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1fqq82/besm_a_star_wars_tale_chapter_1_part_2/

Outside there are dozens of walkers. All headed to the source of the gunshots. A few shuffle curiously into the warehouse
 
I quickly survey my route; a few walkers here and there, but as I approach a group of houses, one of them makes a jump at me from behind some tall shrubs. I loose another shot, and he goes down. I look back, and a veritable horde of zombies is running towards me.

At this point the zombies are practically on top of me. I barely have room to swing my hatchet as their claws and swipes tear at my flesh. I feel a crack as one of their blows hits my leg hard. I shout in pain, save for the piles of bodies carpeting the narrow stairs.
 
I quickly bandage my gushing wounds and I stand to escape. I immediately collapse under the immense pain of a broken leg. I roll down the stairs, I find a handgun and a few magazines of ammunition; I'm not sure what good it will do in my condition.
 
Not knowing where I'm headed, wishing I could use the gun on myself, but I know I can't do it. As the magazine slides in with a click, two more walkers run into the street from around a fence.

In conjunction with the glyph the Sorcerer used the wand of shrinking on the barrels, and had a command word for each barrel that would release the shrink spell and cause the barrels to grow to full size. And another command word to activate the Glyph of Warding.

(The Sorcerer often felt that party members were tools to be used and discarded as suited by his needs.... Just ask the paladin..... Oh wait, you can't, because he got him killed, but that's a different story.) 

Luckily we got out of the way, swarms came to overpower and overtake him. He dropped a handful of barrels high tailed it out, and let the sorcerer activate the barrels. Walked away, but not without his fair share of bumps and bruises.

There was a girl on the way to Dodaca who said that bandits were on the road.  We said we’d watch out.  Well, more than I expected.  It was obvious this girl knew what she was doing.  In a blind rage, and rammed my spear through her, ripping her in two.

Alright

I digress.  Before we knew it, and we managed to take out a good few.  There was something off about them, though.  They looked… soulless.  More like a shell of their former selves.  They had the armor of the border patrol on, which was odd, seeing as how we’re deep in the heart of Salthirn.  They were powerful warriors, eventually knocking our group clean out.
	
We awoke in the middle of the night, but we had no way of getting to them.

Then a Deva appeared.  Rare creature, the bandits were charismatic, welcoming the Deva, surrounding him.  At that moment, however, Easy Torinn used his fire breath, destroying the ropes that bound us to the pole.  I swiftly grabbed both of our gear (I don’t trust Branimir – not yet) and prepared for battle.

The Deva invoked the name of a god named Sehanine
	
A rematch ensued, when Zaharia realized he could stop his invoking prayer.  Just then, Branimir felt a magic tug, and Easy Torinn discovered the magical orb that was controlling the leader of the bandits, the only one who was left.  The Dragonborn destroyed it, and the bandit collapsed.

Terms used in this post that outsiders might not understand:

**Urist Goldmine**: 

A short sturdy creature fond of drink and industry. He has a broad body bearing impressive muscles and a great load of fat. His brass eyes are bulging. His very long beard is braided. His very long hair his arranged in double braids. He has a clear voice. His ears are short. His skin is dark brown.

He is unbelievably strong, and very agile, but he is slow to heal and quite susceptible to disease.

**Forgotten Beast**:

A creature randomly generated at the start of the game. This particular one spat frozen extract and was made of iron

**Malachite**:

An ore of Copper

**Horrortrial**:

A Fortress built with the sole purpose of creating the Ultimate Dwarven Supersoldier. The Third Generation Super Soldiers accomplished this

**Adamantine**:

The ultimate metal. Lightweight, but is still much sharper, stronger, and better for penetrating armour. An Adamantine Battleaxe is widely regarded as the best weapon in the game.

**That bit where Urist went crazy and kicked a guy out of his forge**

The only real flaw I find in it is that you have effectively 1-2 hours of tedious buildup punctuated by 5-10 minutes of raging hell.

Was hanging out at my FLGS and someone who had previously attended one of the LAN parties that I hold about once a month wanted to get a game in.
Game started out pretty normal, gathering resources, etc.

The first combat ended up with him sending a swarm of T1 bombers to wipe out a secondary base and a bunch of my resource extractors.  He'd wiped them out and was encroaching on my main base before I got a T3 fighter in the air to wipe them out.  Took all of 10 seconds to gun them all down

Altogether not much of a setback

A couple of minutes later, taking out my sonar arrays in the middle of the ocean.  Send a few fighters after them, gun them all down, have several of my T3 bombers follow up to try to set him back a bit.

Turns out he has T3 Surface to Air Missile turrets

Next half hour is calm and tedious, reclaiming the destroyed resource extractors...  And most importantly, working on building up a naval fleet.

Three naval bases, energy, or both.

Finally the fleet is complete, arrive on station first, begin firing on his base.

One of his island resource extractors is the first to go

Suddenly he starts freaking out as the main guns turn on the bulk of his base...  ""What was that!!!   What was that!!?""

1366358448.0,1co2nx,(Starwars Empire At War) My butt was sore from the beating,Karl9133,20,2,3,"For those who don't know
I decide I'm just going to go right into a game because I was feeling spunky this one fine day. So I select from the list the option to have the WHOLE GALAXY (which is only 55 planets :P) to play in.
This is the galactic domination mode. As you've probably surmised

That's what I said too. So I set the difficulty on the AI to hard. Little did I know the ride I was in for....

I get into the game after its done loading (I'm playing rebel alliance because I can feel the goodness flowing in me) and I begin to perform my normal strategy of shoring up defenses. I simply take all the space and planetary defenses, because they have garrisons. You also have space stations to build space units.) I take on planet and I build all my important structures on it, (i.e. command outpost type structure, vehicle and infantry structures, etc, all the military stuff) and I construct mining plants on all the other planets. The planets on my outer edge I construct, minor defensive ground structures. I'm not expecting anything this soon. Now, building new units

5 minutes in. My eyes are suddenly assaulted by the games warning mechanic:flashing red lights and a huge message saying ""HEY IDIOT SOMEHTINGS HAPPENING"", silly AI thinking he's cool. So into in. I forgot to check on how big the fleet was.

12 accalmators. They're light cruisers, save for the two squadrons I get as garrison. Now, the larger ships, such as my cruisers and space stations, have hard points. Meaning that you can target a specific part on these ships. Engines, shield generators, weapon systems.

Here's another nice little tidbit about these accalmators. These are imperial ships. And what is the imperial navy known for? TIE fighters. And guess what? These assholes can drop a squad of these bad boys when it warps in from its hanger bay (one of its hardpoints). AND a squad of TIE bombers. The bombers in this game fire torpedoes

So recap. What's going on? I've got two squadrons of fighters

I decide to hell with it ill take these bastards on. I see a cloud of the TIE fighters swarm towards me. Not too tough to fight. I lose both squadrons

But wait. Where are the bombers? 
They swooped in from the left. My station could only bend over and accept its fate. It's gone. Dead. Destroyed.
End of battle screen pops up. Shows me what I lost. All units lost
2:13's. 
guess what. They didn't lose a damned thing. So now I've got an enemy fleet breathing heavily down my neck because they can strike my core worlds which are COMPLETELY unprotected. I can't build units in time

Another mechanic of this game is that some planets have native populations. They will fight for or against you

It was at this point I started regretting picking hard difficulty...
To make this story short. And save my fingers the typing:
I got down to my last planet. It hasn't even been 15 minutes. The AI was spanking me like i was in fifty shades of grey. By this time they'd researched better ships. And they had more money. And they had time. So much time. The fleet they built just for my incy wincy little planet: 17 acclamators, they could only bring it a total of 20 points worth of units, and these cruisers are worth 3 each. So, all the heavy cruisers get sent in, plus a light cruiser or two. 
I've still got my shitty light cruisers. At that point I just said to myself ""do I really wanna humiliate myself anymore?"" So...I gave up. I had the computer decide my fate. Auto battle. 

I lost everything. They lost
The ground battle wasn't even a question. The game was over at that point. I turned of empire at war and sat reflecting. The only thing I could think of was ""what the fuck was I thinking.""

The match lasted for no more than 20. Never played hard mode again to this day.

Hope you enjoyed! Let me know if you want more :)

So I was playing in a Gamma World campaign that was very similar to Fallout 3 in world and setting. I played as a half cat/half human hybrid mutant race and I was the party's face/charisma monkey. I could pretty much convince anyone of anything and was about as lucky as Jar-Jar Binks in episode I.

So we get to, Lisa, and she had us go out to some memorial to stop some drug trading that was going on. We talk to Lisa's daughter, Lydia, for other reasons I don't quite remember but Lydia wanted to overthrow her bitch mother and take over the city so we decided to side with her. On the way out of the city we noticed this guy jump down this hole on the deck of the ship, I'm pretty sure at this point we suspect this guy of being the drug lord's informant. We went over to investigate and I was the only one small enough or agile enough to get in. I contemplated going down after him but I decided to do so later because my character was kind of a coward.

So we went out to this drug dealer's HQ and got in. When we walked in we noticed he had this huge robot power his place. They had hooked him up to the main lines using it's reactor for their power. We moved on and I started negotiating with him. I tried getting him to let me sell his drugs for him so he wouldn't have to sell to rivet city because after all I was an adventurer and could make him way more money than he could just selling to people in Rivet City. I tried selling him this ridiculous deal where I would give him 100% profit and all his cronies were looking at him like

We got back to rivet city and Lydia had started her takeover of the city and there was all kinds of fire being exchanged from both sides on the main deck where the market area had used to be. I went down the hole we saw that guy, I don't quite remember though. I killed a lot of people in that game.

Fast forward the story a couple months, that it would test their true strength and that if the succeeded in smoking it it would make the overall a better warrior. So they all smoked it, including me because of course it would look suspicious if I was the only one not smoking. I had an ace up my sleeve though. I was able to feign smoking it and not receive any of the negative effects of actually doing so. After they all smoked it and it was morning again we found that at least one of them had a seizure in the night and died and all the others were sick except for one dude. So during breakfast I snuck some blue meth powder under his food so he would eat it, and he did.

That's pretty much where the campaign came to a close and we picked up something else unfortunately but it ended with me knowing I had really fucked up a lot of people and I was happy about that.",self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ckh63/the_short_version_of_how_i_poisoned_a_bunch_of/

**The Day of Rest... Sort Of:**

After the last couple of adventurous days. The party is feeling pretty exhausted and pretty broke. The group take to the Blaise Inn and Tau negotiates a show that night with Selmic and our group. The inn keeper is pretty dismissive

We take to the markets to garner some interest from the people of Westgate. Tau

Nohrai

The crowd enjoyed the performance and were told to come to the show at the Blaise inn that night.

**General Questing:**

After taking care of that the group tends to go their own ways. Taking care of some personal agendas. Lia's looking to join an Assassins guild

We gather some leads during the rest of our day for our needs and prepare for the show and head over to the Inn.

**Time to Rock:**

The inn is surrounded by a fairly decent crowd. Our group heads in and gets lubricated with some free drinks from the bar and begins to set up for the performance.

Nohrai gives the group some ""Inspiring Words"" and tell Tau that we're going to rock out tonight. Tau is confused by this. Nohrai tells Tau that when he's playing music just think of rocks.

There's no real stage in the room so Nohrai has an idea. He shouts out to the crowd to stand back with little success. Nohrai slams his axes together and tell everyone to ""Back the fuck up!"". This time people listen.

Nohrai turns around and slams his axe blade into the ground using ""Stone Panopoly"" and a jagged stone stage bursts forth from the ground. The audience goes wild.

Tau and Selmic enter as they did on the rooftop and begin singing Bohemian Rhapsody again. The crowds loving it. They play a few other songs. Nohrai says to Tau ""I think it's time"".

Tau takes a moment to think. The crowd goes silent. The imagery of the rock comes to him and he begins stomping and clapping. Boom-Boom-Chick

The earth begins to shake in a two block radius and the whole crowd joins in.

Tau begins:

*""Buddy you're a boy make a big noise; Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day; You got mud on yo' face; You big disgrace; Kickin' your can all over the place""*

The crowd is going nuts. Drinks are going every

Then the chorus begins:

**'*'We will

The sound of the show is ring out across the entire city.

Tau picks up Selmic and throws him to Nohrai. Nohrai holds him up and Selmic opens his cape. A mosh pit forms in front of the stage and Nohrai launches Selmic into the crowd. People are flooding Selmic’s mask with booze.

The show ends and everyone is fairly trashed. The bar has basically run dry and there's unconscious bodies everywhere.

Nohrai has the last cask of ale and is drinking from the tap. The inn-keep began closing up and having people escorted out. Nohrai took the opportunity to heave one of his fans out of the door and then passed out.

Lia and Tau helped to escort some people out. In his last glimpse of consciousness the two tried helping Nohrai upstairs but his body collapsed in the middle of the staircase. They left him there until the next morning.

**The Hangover:**

The inn keeper was astounded by how many people had shown up and how wild the concert was. The show raked in 600gp profit even with all the repairs needed. Tau talked out a fairly respectable cut in exchange for a couple of repeat performances. 

Nohrai was passed out and didn't wake up till late in the day while Tau and Lia were stuck cleaning up but got a free hot breakfast.

Nohrai stumbled downstairs later and finished off the cold breakfast.

The evening wind carried the stench of decay and smoke through the evening air as Nico and I watched over the ruined husk of Chernogorsk. Before the outbreak, our method of defense is laughable. Nico has a pistol so old it may or may not have killed Nazis

A small man crouches in the middle of the street, blackened face. Nico gets low, and signals for me to do the same. The man slowly goes back to studying the small rocks in the road, and hops away. Nico and I slowly make our way across the street to a dimly lit church. As Nico walks in, he raises his pistol at a body that is at the lectern in the front of the church. The initial scene is eerie, as the man is bent over the lectern, clutching a dim glowstick

As we draw in closer, and I hesitate but look down. The hard leather leg holster I was wearing has completely folded and broken, but it may have saved me from a broken leg. Nico rummages through his rucksack. Our meager medical supplies clearly cannot treat the deep wound produced by the trap. Nico pulls out his map of Chernogorsk, and quickly plots a route to the nearest hospital. I can barely stand, so I will have to remain behind. 

All remaining light in the sky has left by the time that Nico begins to leave the church. I had picked up an old lever action shotgun that the dead man at the lectern had by his feet. Nico has given me some pain medication to stop the shaking of my hands from the pain

...

I look at my watch. The glowing marks indicate it has been an hour since Nico left. I began to grow worried. The hospital was not too far away. My worries quickly faded as I heard fast footfalls. These footfalls were too fast and measured to be one of the dead's. My fears quickly regain their place as the footfalls pass me to investigate the body that is leaned over the lectern. Nico would have called out. I see the dim outline of the stranger, but I can't say I place his life over mine. The man turns toward me, and I see him raise his rifle. Before he can even take aim, I pull my trigger. The boom is deafening within the confines of the church. The man slumps over into the side of one of the pews. I drag myself closer, and the man is clutching a bubbling wound in his chest. He drops his rifle and shakily exhales. His eyes glint in the pale glow of the glowstick. They meet mine. He looks at me for one last moment before he draws his last breath.

...

Another fifteen minutes pass when I hear the call word quietly said. i respond in kind. Nico comes in and checks my leg. He opens up his rucksack, and several magazines of ammo in his backpack.

This was one of my favorite moments from a relatively short compaign.

For those not in the know, the Phantom, et cetera, et cetera. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's also not entirely jokey, either; it has good rules and a nice atmosphere, even in the rulebook. (To wit, exclamation point included

In this campaign, a mad scientist à la Girl Genius' Agatha Heterodyne; Ladd, a war veteran and complete psychopath; Victor, a professional race car driver and all-round vehicle enthusiast; and last, my own character, Apollo Fox, a professional thief who makes his ""honest"" living as a stage magician.

In our Spirit of the Century game, bent on world domination, the result of an experiment by the brilliant Doctor Methuselah. (I feel I should reiterate my first line: Spirit of the Century is a hell of a game.) As one might expect, rather than face us directly, he sent his gorilla cohorts after us, possibly in the aims of creating a battle of attrition which we would come out of weakened to a state that we couldn't fight him.

I will hand it to my team, with the former fighting using a weaponized Tesla coil, and the latter with an Archimedes death ray. I am told the scent of burning gorilla hair is indelibly etched into the team's collective memory as a result. Ladd, our former soldier, occupied his time by firing from the back of a speeding car driven by Victor, which was an altogether effective strategy as the average gorilla can't keep up with a motor vehicle on the move.

But Apollo was in a bit of a pickle; being a thief and a stage magician, so he had no convenient gadgetry to dispatch his opponents. Growing up on the mean streets had taught him a thing or two about hand-to-hand combat, but it was an iffy proposition against formidable opponents like these.

One of my favorite maxims as a tabletop gamer is that fortune favors the bold. If you're in a do-or-die situation, or you'll fail so amazingly that it will have been worth it.

Fortune favors the bold

1365519955.0,1bzqjm,The screams of Horrortrial. [Dwarf Fortress],Urytion,17,0,10,"WARNING: This is a very long story. You've been warned.

Horrortrial. A grand Duchy of the Dwarven Empire. A mighty fortress with great walls of iron. Where the furnaces never slept, who got a grand tour of the facilities.

It was Summer of the year 257. I had been invited to meet with Duke Litash of Horrortrials, or discarded bone bolts. I shivered, but continued walking, accompanying the scheduled trading caravan. 

Dwarves in steel armour, spooking our horses. The interior of the fortress was no great marvel. A pile of dead goblins to the right of me, giving of a horrifying stench. Vomit all over the interior walls, from these cave dwelling dwarves. Farms, growing berries, with dwarves in ragged cloth clothing running frantically between them stuffing them into barrels, before disappearing back underground. But the worst thing was the dogs. At least 50 hulking dogs, guarded the cave entrance. They were thin

Leaving the merchants setting up for their annual market, a malnourished kobold found his way to the Cave Entrance. I backed away in fright, but the 50 dogs pounced on him, ripping him to shreds in an instant. I glanced over, one of the dogs had a gaping wound in it's side, but none of the dwarves seemed to care. They just collected the bag and dagger from the corpse, and left it to lie.

The first floor was just a pile of gold and silver goods, preparing to trade with my brethren.

I took a moment to examine the artwork engraved into the walls. Elves on fire, a dwarf eating cheese, an homage to the picture of a dwarf eating cheese. These are a depraved people. I continue my walk down the hallway, but was almost knocked over by a dwarf walking absentmindedly outside muttering ""Need the bones. Likostorogoth... need bones... NEED BONES."" 

I continued downwards

A... graveyard. Piles and piles of coffins, and a platinum sarcophagus, memorial slab, and two platinum statues. I examined the slab. ""To Urist GoldMines, The Everlasting Squid. Militia Commander of The Ales of Apes. Killed in 255 by Dastot Shadowhunted the Goblin."" The first statue was a picture of Urist, striking down a goblin, and posing fiercely. This Dwarf was clearly an object of worship for these people. The second was a blacksmith forging an adamantine blade. A plaque on the statue called it ""Urist Goldmine"". Apparently this man crafted his own weapon.

I left the tomb touched by their traditions. Maybe they weren't so horrible afterall. But then, the Duke's Quarters. A palace by all means, with his own private militia force guarding him, his own food stockpile. This man was a tyrant. Any sympathy I had for his race, instantly vanished. ""Ah. Human."" he groaned. He lifted himself off of his platinum throne. ""I'm going downstairs to oversee the festivities. Care to join me?"" It was evident in his tone, I had no choice. I followed his furious pace, bumping into several dwarves along the way. Several were sobbing, throwing his clothes at the nearby statues.

I finally caught up to the Duke. He was sitting, watching as the goblin failed to defend himself against the furry onslaught.

""Ha. This isn't torture, where a goblin armed with a pike had overcome his challenge of 20 war dogs. A nearby dwarf pulled a lever, and released the Dwarven Champion. An impressive figure, clad in full Steel plate armour, with a red cape. In his right hand, a steel shield, in his left

The Duke turned to me with a glint in his eye. ""Oh right you are. I will show you the pride of Horrortrial."" As I followed him, sure, but they had one serious problem. They were still just Dwarves. What we needed was a soldier that was above mortal concerns. Above fear, above pain. To that end, we created this.""

What I saw was appalling. Dwarven Children, biting at them. ""The dogs bite the child, and the child strikes back."" explained the Duke, with that glint returning to his eye. ""After a short while, the strongest emerge. If the child dies, he was not worthy. He is... disposed of. If he survives, he quickly becomes a scarred, the child is above mortal concerns. He just... ceases to care."" cackled Litash. ""But then... we have pain. Watch my human friend."" He pulled a nearby lever

He wiped a tear away from his eye. ""Dwarven engineering at it's finest human."" He guided me, and assistance in our war against the goblins, but all I could manage was ""Nice place you've carved yourself here"", then sprinted out the fortress.

I must have offended someone. When I reached the gate, charging at me. I tried to back away, but walked straight into Litash, now fully armed and armed as well. ""Welcome to Horrortrial.""

The last thing I remember is my blood draining from me, and taking the dead horses downstairs. I closed my eyes and rested, seeing the Goddess Lisha, wrapping me in her arms.

This story is... kind of true. All the places and people described were true. And I did have my baron kill the diplomat. And yes

So, and enemy patrols start using laser sights and flashlights.  This means you can see them from a long way away and try to avoid them.  Immediately after exiting the base, a helicopter bears down on me.  He's easy enough to take down, but I'm now out of ammo on my RPGs and every squad in the area now knows where I am.  I sprint into the woods and start using cloak mode to try and get past.  

I make it to the river without incident and grab a boat, and the helicopter destroyed it with a missile.  As I said, I didn't have any RPG ammo so all I could really do was run.  I stayed on the fringes where there was shrubbery and dove underwater when I could.  The helicopter AI in this game is almost omniscient, however, so trying to find cover is actually a demanding task.  

Anyways, but I have a dozen soldiers looking for me.  I chose to take the stealthy route here, ducking past the soldiers and continuing downriver.  The soldiers didn't follow, but the helicopter did.  In retrospect, it would have been smarter to take out the outpost as I could have snagged an RPG and been on my way, but I didn't know that at the time.

The best thing about Metal Gear Online was how adaptive it was. It was the perfect blend of stealth and action that ensured you could play it any way that you wished. Want to run and gun and go for headshots? Go ahead. Want to sneak around the battlefield, and then take his weapon? Sure.

It also had this game mode called Team Sneaking. One team were the defenders, non-lethal weapon wielding attackers, to wanted to capture the targets and return them to the sneaking team's base.

The goal is simple: Attackers sneak around the battlefield, where the round will be won. The defenders, on the other hand, are required to defend them from the attackers. They have the benefit of actually being able to kill, while the other team can only use tranqs to put them to sleep, or CQC to knock them out. (Or they could stab them with their knife)

One night I was playing, and a lot utter defeats.

But this was going to be different. The people that joined were all decent ranks

It started off, an Enemy Locator grenade, and I can't remember what else. We start out agressively. Going for high ground quick and clean. It's easier that way, because if they have to look up, towards the bright sky, they might not see us trying to put them to sleep with tranq darts.

Quite some time passes, it was down to me and one other guy.

The map, and then I notice the clock, roughly two or so minutes to go. I look around for the enemy, and see he's nowhere to be found. I am pretty sure he's waiting back at the goal point, so I bolt towards the objective. I take it, and turn around to go the back way. My heart is racing. We're the last of our teams. The clock is counting down. My hands are shaking. I'm not sneaking anymore, and my aim is not true.

He pops out around the corner. ""Of course he's right there!"" I scream in my paranoid, very accurate but not very strong. I jump away from his fire, and let go of the objective. We can win the game by killing all enemies or by capturing the objective. There's no way I can take it back in, or else he'll get me when I run, so I decide to leave it, because it's clear we have to fight right now.

We are mere feet apart. That close. He misses every round of his M4 but can't risk reloading, hitting and missing at random intervals, slowly taking down his stamina, getting closer and closer to knocking him out. He then pulls out his pistol, which was a lot more lethal than mine. But then I run out of ammo. I can't reload or else I'd be a sitting duck. So I run in for the CQC. I'm punching and kicking, grabbing and slamming, he's running and jumping, I think. I've got this, but I miss, and I try to roll into him

I still think about it. But he was the better fighter. And no matter how close that game was

That game meant a lot to me over the years. One of the games I'll remember for a while. I just wish I could have added that guy and played with him on MY team.

I'm not a good storyteller

I have another MGO tale that lasted multiple games over about six hours of continuous play that started with me channeling my inner Solid Snake. I may post that later.

So I start a match with my little D'Artagnan

The match ensued and it was a slaughterfest. We were losing tanks left and right. Me and another Arty were alone

This enemy tank, he had seen us. Now or never I say, I pellet him with a HE round. It hits him for a third of his life. Now i'm shivering. I can be oneshotted easely. ""Stay away!!!!"" I use rubble to hide my thin flat paper metal vehicle. He hits my friendly arty, he got shot with one round. I'm still reloading and he keeps approaching.Setting his sights on me he shoots again, it bounces! The angle was too small to get through my armour. I live for another 5 seconds. Finaly reloaded!

I pellet him again, but he can't lower his gun deep enough to hit me. 

I tell to myself. ""Did he really just hug my right side??? YES HE DID!"" I turn my gun towards him. And yes the reticle pops onto his tank. Aaah you little rascal and your funny quirks. But then it sinks in. This will end it.

I hush to the tank ""Au revoir D'artagnan!"" I shoot. And in a blaze of glory I kill the enemy tank. But the cost is grave

Grimgy's Blunder

We had just came back from an encounter with a boss and had a ton of loot (which we teleported with us). Our rogue had got some throwing knives and knew that they were magical, ""What's the duration on that?"" The player didn't know, so he went to look it up and the look on his face was priceless: ""Permanent..."" Our rogue was now permanently a bunny. On top of all that because our rouge was mouthing off with the DM previously, the DM had some fuchsia goop fall on his head and change his hair color to fuchsia. The rogue was now a fuchsia bunny. [Since we were all new to D&amp;D, we didn’t know that a permanent spell could be broken with break enchantment, etc.] Our DM decided to have some mercy and said that the mages at the castle we were at were able to partially get rid of the spell leaving him with a form of lycanthropy. He would have to roll will saves to not turn into a bunny. Later on after having it for awhile our DM let him go into the form at will, and let him keep his class abilities as well.

**Background:**

Our adventurers are in the city of Westgate

The city is currently under the control of the Fire Knives (FK)

The Nine Golden Swords (NGS) are a faction for the people

The party has previously had some negative experiences with the FKs but after decimating a group of them there has been an offer of truce.

The party has just arrived back in town after recently travelling south to help Tau's sick wife. We healed her but she ended up from severe depression (-3 Charisma Stat).

**The Party:**

Nalla - An orphaned Goliath

Nohrai - A Shield Dwarf who excels at both combat as a warlord and as a Warsmith.

Tau - A Changling Bard

Yolo - A Drow cleric of Kord

Bastard - A Half-Orc Barbarian

**Welcome Home:**

We join our adventurers just as they're re-entering the city from their travels. While away they met Nalla

The plan is to show the FKs that they were willing to kill the NGSs and fall into rank. However

Nohrai summons the members of the NGSs to The Old Beard

**The Old Beard:**

On the way to the bar

They are told that the FKs would be willing to form a truce and potentially take us into their ranks if we were willing to prove our devotion to the faction.

Nohrai mentions the meeting

They continue onward to The Old Beard

Nohrai mentions the Halfling and offers some gold if Bastard could stop the Halfling from entering. Immediately Bastard spots the Halfling and apparently recognizes him. Bastard lurches forwards sprinting after the halfling screaming ""Where's my sword!""

Bastard runs the Halfling down and proceeds to grab him and beat the life

Meanwhile

The representative of the NGS casts down the plant and instead just wants the party to listen into the meeting and report back. Nohrai begrudgingly agrees and they part ways.

On the way back to the rest of the party Nohrai and Yolo run into Bastard carrying a purple and swollen Halfling head as well as a gleaming bastard sword. Nohrai notices and insignia for the FKs on the head and mentions it to Bastard. The group discuss that they share the goal of bringing the FKs down and the Bastard is willing to join them

**The Meeting:**

Prior to the meeting Nohrai has Nalla prepare the potion of *Seemingly Eternal Sleep*, while Tau and Bastard join the NGS backup (just in case).

Nohrai's group are met inside by a number of FKs mercenaries who order Nohrai to call over the NGSs backup members to be slaughtered. Nohrai uses a wind whisper ritual to first tell Tau to poison the half-Orc

Across the road, taking 3 down with his poisoned (sleep potion) sword.

The remaining NGS members retaliate and strike at Bastard bringing him to his knees. Tau runs up from behind and stabs him again with the poisoned dagger and Bastard falls into a deep slumber appearing dead.

The room is very tense and the NGS members order Tau to drop his weapon. He does and begins negotiating his way out of what appears to be a trap for the NGS. They tie him up

The remaining 3 NGS mercenaries grab their comrades and run off into the night leaving and unconscious Half-Orc and a tied up changeling.

After hearing the ruckus from across the road

Nohrai calls over the mercenaries from the FKs and says that they've been caught out by the NGS. They've taken one of our party hostage and appear to have poisoned another

The mercenaries take them blindfolded to a FK stronghold and have Bastard and the Shou man checked out. Both awaken after a period and are interrogated by the FK.

Bastard says that the group was double crossed by the NGS

The FKs said that the party was free to leave but they would keep the Shou prisoner and be in contact soon. Nohrai bluffs that they want to keep the Shou for themselves to torture and beat him for the double crossing.

Lacking credibility the FKs begin to doubt the story. Nohrai turns to the Shou to beat him and Bastard jumps on him and stabs what he believes to be a traitor with the still poisoned dagger. Tau falls back into a deep sleep. However

After arriving back to base

Nohrai contacts the NGS using wind word. They are displeased to say the least with his actions from the night before. He mentions that they well integrated into the FKs now and will being providing the NGS with a stream of information.

The NGS don't want to be in physical contact with the party anytime soon and would like to see valuable information arriving ASAP. Or else they will turn on the party as well.",self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1hb6ez/dd4e_infiltrating_the_factions/

\\http://i.imgur.com/hFqFJIp.png

So we are playing 3.5 and I am playing a fighter who just gained Cleave. We have a Cleric of Palor and a Ranger specializing in archery. 

We get into this dungeon where a mad wizard was conducting experiments on prisoners and effectively turning them into controllable zombies. What we deduced it was some kind of heavy hallucinogenic similar I guess to Bath Salts.

But what happened in that room probably is my best Dungeons and Dragons story ever.

We go in, dwarves, etc. Until we reach his chamber, as it turns out, he is just a feeble old guy whose mind is totally and utterly gone. 

We decide to not harm him

He gave the stuff to a freakin troll and it is locked in that cage with bars a good four inches thick.

Well

My fighter pulls his greatsword

He pulls the old guy into two

Then

Guess we shouldn't have pulled that lever.

So the troll roars again and the Ranger pulls the lever down. Trapping our cleric in the cage and impaling the troll with one of the spikes through the leg. The ranger smiles and lets loose an arrow

I then pull the lever

20.

To hit? 20. DECAPIFUCKINGTATION!!!!

But I am not done yet. While the cleric heals me from inside the cage and the ranger lets loose as well. I cleave my way through three dozen of them.

Before I pick up where we left off in part 2

While we were living on the road and scavenging what we could, but we PCs vowed revenge.

And now back to where we left off :)

After the death of so many people around him, werewolves and rogue cartoon characters? It wasnt that I intended to play this character as a psychopath, but every NPC around me was getting slaughtered one way or another and there was definitely blood on Joe Gribble's hands whether he wanted to acknowledge it or not. 

However

I awoke on the other side of the graveyard wall, barely making it across. ""Not yet, Gribble, not yet"" I grunted as my shaking arms levered me over the edge, the still unhealed werewolf claw wounds in my back beginning to bleed again.

I soon met up with the 2 new PC's (replacing those that died in the werewolf battle)

So I tell them about the coordinates in Oklahoma and we agree to go there forthwith. We (me

I was away from the group

Dialogue ensues. They try to apologize. I tell them if they ever cross Joe Gribble again I will kill them like I killed Scarface. Over the next few days of rest one of them makes a sincere attempt to atone for what he did

All of us were pretty torn up from our respective trips, he was the brother of the werewolf that gave me these bitchin scars.

The rest of the group accepts him for the sake of metagame

So we go on our walk

After we resolve our immediate disputes and regain our HP

So once again we're back at the armored gas-station

We heard the moaning first and hid ourselves as best we could, heh, it's a gas station, heh. I bet there's nachos inside."" ""Uhuhuh, hey you guys, uhuhuh, tear that door down.""

As the zombies begin to rip at the barricades, there are no chips and no cheese among them. Professor Werewolf steps up and begins to attempt to negotiate with these inhuman things to no avail. As the diplomacy yields nothing (cmon, it's Beavis and Butthead) Cody hatches his own plan. 

In retrospect, Cody starts kicking Professor Werewolf in the dick. For 2 or 3 rounds before starting to run away. 

Meanwhile outside we hear the sound of vehicles and automatic gunfire

I am rent anew by werewolf claws as zombies dogpile on top of us both. I know I will only have one chance to save myself

Meanwhile the other PC's have gotten into the militia vehicles and are about to take off. I tell the DM that I'm going to break the grapple by kicking Professor Werewolf off of me and into the zombies. Natural fucking 20. I get up and run for the nearest vehicle while he tears through the other zombies

And that was how Joe Gribble died, but in the end he proved to be the savior of the group in that he was a great distraction to the Professor Werewolf that Cody unleashed upon us all.

---------------------------------

My friends were nervous. We had been locked into this cave by some unknown entity, is totally zoned out. My friend leans over, and quietly mentions *Herobrine*. I quietly chuckle at him. ""You're funny"" I say under my breath. Almost immediately, my little brother, who heard nothing, says ""Who's that?"" We all focus on his screen. We see nothing but cave. ""Someone was there. I swear."" He says, with a sense of urgency. I scan all of the screens on the TV. Not a single one of us is near him. I can feel a knot begin to form in my stomach. ""Hey, let's do something else"" I say

I go into the other room and grab my laptop. I knew strange things had happened previously, I had to check my world. I found some irregularities quickly. There was an open nether portal in the middle of the woods I had not placed. When I entered this portal, it lead to the same portal my gateway lead to. There were *three* portals, something I do not think is possible. When exiting the portal in the nether, it lead me back to my home. I could feel my paranoia tightening the knot in my stomach. I visited the cave we had been. I did not go in, but I could see where we had gone, and I peered over the edge. Darkness greeted me at the bottom of the pit.

Simply being here was giving me the willies, the outpost marked a place that I did not want to venture any further eastward. I explored along my rail line, and came upon something that startled me even more. along the beach, halfway in between the outpost and the adjoining mountain was a small strip of sand in the water. On the sand, were tracks. *Tracks I had not placed.* I could feel the hairs on my neck begin to rise. I had never let anyone else play on this world. I remember using a calculator to find out how much iron I would need for a rail line, and wasting tracks would not be something I would do.

I explored further, I checked the cave. *There was yet another unlit torch.* My fright was rising, and I marked the island with a giant tower of cascading water. I knew something was wrong here. *I felt it.*

The game begins with Bro #2 and I pissed about our map placements. Neither one of us can find our berries, getting Feudal Age first and launching a rush on the Byzantines before the latter can get their shit together. I finally find my berries after getting a successful farming industry and boom my population to twice it's size, delaying my Castle Age and widening the gap. By this point the Byzantines have been halfway slaughtered and without a military are now using watchtowers offensively.

In a secret meeting among kings, while persuing a more ambitious goal: to create a horde the likes of which have never been seen.

It was a peaceful morning on the eastern fringe of the Hun empire. A small mining town has recently erected a temporary wooden defense, before piercing deeper. A lumberjacking community to the west was asssaulted next, and it was here that the experienced Hun cavalry and their well-equipped swordsmen confronted the horde. An epic battle took place over the fields of grain, but under fire from multiple stone fortifications and towers, along with the might of the best shock troops in the world, the horde was finally stopped.

The Hun king then taunted the Franks for the defeat of their army.

On the next Hun raid of the Byzantine defenses, this time crushing them and preventing a retreat to friendly territory. The Frankish message was clear: You defeated -an- army. The horde moved north, suddenly bursting forth from the trees and slaughtering a woodcutting camp in the far west of the empire, its most vulnerable flank.

The Huns responded by building their own army of champions and cavaliers, running deep into the woods to escape the charging horde. They suddenly emerge in unfamiliar territory.

There is a wide open plain ahead. An abandoned stonemining camp sits at the foot of a construction project unlike anything else in the world. A cathedral to the western God rises above the hills and the trees

Word gets out. The Franks have advanced to the status of true empire

The Hun king has found his target. The entire army and its artillery are unleashed, and even the Byzantines, once allied with the Franks, have now turned their wrath against them. The fight rages on, until the entire row of artillery prepares its payload.

The line breaks; the Franks close in. A few stones are thrown but the majority are cut down

Final score:

Bro #1 (Huns) 9
Me (Franks) 6
Bro #2 (Byzantines) 5

**Prepare for Battle:**

*(This doesn't relate to Selimic, we were fairly terrified because it meant they were educate)*. On his cheek he was branded with a dagger in a circle, the brand of the Fire Knives. Turns out we were stirring up some trouble in town and they didn't like it.

That day we prepared reinforced the temple ready for battle. Spike pits in front of the windows

That night we kept watch waiting for the inevitable assault on our temporary home.

**The Assault:**
Night rolled around and just as the second watch rolled around

Suddenly

At the front door Nohrai could see another behemoth of man with flail wailing on the front door as some Halflings raised some ladders to the windows with the spike pits underneath.

One of the Halflings reached the top of the window and knocked it in and pulled at his sling and took a shot at Nohrai. The second halfling came running up the ladder with two slings in each hand. This stupidity lead to him falling into the pit below.

At the same time the large man at the back door with the flail knocked out the remaining boards and entered the building. While Yolo and Tau dealt with the large man. Lia took out here bow and launched an arrow through the remaining Halflings head

Visibly shaken by the death of his allies the behemoth at the front door was driven into a blood rage slamming heavily against the door. After failing again and again he fell to his knees weeping. He was done. 

The remaining hulking man was finished off by Tau and Yolo

**The Next Morning:**
The temple was saved and the party helped to clean and repair the temple. It appeared the Fire Knives would have to take this party seriously.

Nohrai stepped out and posted a sign in the courtyard stating the party was sick of this shit and willing to talk seriously. He returned to the sign finding a note stating the Fire Knives would be in contact soon.

SAMP for short.  I was on a role playing server and the Admins had set up a Death Match event where all the factions get set up in a sectioned off in the unused city of San Fiero. The event was this, there was one that was better than any other.  That was the battleship.   Now the battleship only has one entrance and that is from the sea

So we all start off at the center of the map. At the construction site that is by the gas station. We have a good starting position. The timer to begin starts ticking down. Im driving so I am reving my engine. I got about 4 people car surfing as well as 3 people in the car with me. When the clock reaches zero about half the players all make a b line for the tunnel that takes you to the battleship.  We arent off to a good start... Already falling behind by the time we make it to the ship people are already pulling up and getting out of their cars to get to the bunker.  (Whoever gets there first claims the spot as their gangs) So all my teammates are saying we should go to one of the other spots and I put on my not today face and floor it. I mean I get the van going as fast as it could possibly go. I say 7 words and everyone is saying what the hell. Those words are ""I hope you know how to swim"" Everyone is freaking out as I launch our van 30 some feet off the pier and into the water. We all get out (or off for those car surfing) and swim to the battleship and were able to claim it for ourselves. 

As the grace period ends, but we hold the battleship fairly well. Eventually we loose the event because gangs stopped coming to our bunker. So we have to go out and find the gangs that are left.  Eventually the last of us die and the game ends for us.

I’m so amazingly goddamn rich. A string of gold-studded and jewel-encrusted Mine levels led straight into the Jungle, long before the ghost they trigger showed up. And now I’ve found the Black Market.

It’s a network of shops where, and one that’s available nowhere else: the Ankh. The Ankh gives you a second life, and costs $50,000. It’s hard to earn $50,000. I have $120,000.

Before I get it, and a snail blows acid bubbles up the ladder that could help me bypass them.

I buy a shotgun from the top floor, and onto the snail. The snail is crushed, but the tribesmen are wild: by the time I pick myself up, one has thrown himself to his death and the other has jumped into the shops. Now he prowls them slowly, looking for me.

This is tense. I’m dying to shoot him

There’s a boomerang on sale in this shop actually. The tribesman walks up to it. He picks it up.

For a split second

Then my internal simulation of Spelunky’s interacting systems kicks in

I run.

I jump onto the ladder, duck behind a mound of earth and hug the ground. Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Christ.

For a second

Then the Black Market explodes.

##Synopsis:

A group of six blocky men have traveled to a new continent on an expedition to explore and document the dangerous unknown. Two soldiers, eager to map out the unknown and face the unspeakable horrors that abound on its land. With their ship destroyed by the whims of the ocean and their supplies washed away into the blue abyss, they must start from scratch if they intend to survive and make their way back home.

A week into the expedition has led the adventuring party to a mountain, a traitor in the group reveals himself. One of the soldiers, intent on creating his own empire in this new world, has trapped one of the party members deep inside an abandoned mineshaft, and has put his evil plan into action!

Now the rest of the party must find a way to free their trapped friend and escape this labyrinth of death. Will they ever see their party member again? What surprises has the traitor set up for the unwitting group?

###Part 2: The Cave Story
##Chapter 4: Trapped!

Saturday rolled around with a fresh set of rules in place. Aaron, the rest of us agreed to not break any blocks except where we were allowed to (so he wouldn't have to escape-proof the walls with Obsidian, like he had done with my current trap). He was also not allowed to put us in any ""no win"" situations.

With the rules set, wondering where Aaron and I had gone off to. They decided to eat, forge themselves better tools for further explanation (and, of course, more torches), and then would come searching for us if we hadn't returned by the time they had finished. I knew I would be stuck here for a while, and I paced in my cell aimlessly for what seemed like hours.

On one lap of my dungeon prison, and the room and outside mineshaft was thoroughly lit, so no unholy creatures could have spawned from there. So why was I hearing zombies? I moved slowly toward the back corner of the room again, and sure enough heard more zombies. They must be just on the other side of the wall. I quickly ran back to the placating silence of the doorway.

I could hear my party over Skype chat worrying about how long we were taking. Greg suggested a search party, or no one goes. Of course, upon voting whether to search or stay, only Mark had voted to stay. Begrudgingly, he packed up his supplies and set out with the others.

Aaron had seemingly vanished. Perhaps he was delving deeper into the mountain

As I stared at the prison I was stuck inside, optimistically thinking I might be able to make it. I ran over and pressed the button, and noticed a light in the opposite corner of the room go out. A zombie moaned, louder than before.

I turned slowly to where the light had gone out, activated the  door, but instead opened up a hole in the wall where the light used to be, one block wide and two blocks tall. A zombie shuffled into the room. A skeleton spawned in the darkened corner. Letting out an audible curse, I ran toward the new danger and thrust a torch into the wall close enough to light up the darkness and stop any more skeletons from spawning. I was struck by an arrow for my effort, and quickly retreated to the opposite corner of the room. I unsheathed my stone sword and waited, staring grimly as another zombie made its way in

*Hurry up

##Chapter 5: The Clock is Ticking...

Greg and Kyle were in the lead of the expedition, but still they went cautiously, making sure to check any small side rooms for evidence or monsters. Eventually, they saw the hole we had climbed down to reach the mineshaft, and as they were surveying it I could hear Greg organizing them. He would go down first, followed by Mark, then Kyle

Cautiously, sending all four members of the search party falling to the next level of stairs some fifteen blocks down. They were all heavily injured by the fall, and exchanged many expletives as they ate their fill of bread and apples. At least there were only two more turns left before they would reach the bottom of the hole, so any more falls would be an inconvenience, but not necessarily life-threatening.

Meanwhile, and I was forced to retreat to my cell. At least I was building up a nice collection of rotten flesh. I finished killing the nearest zombie to me and quickly ate a piece of bread to replenish my fairly low health. One loaf left, and an endless stream of zombies still to go. 

Suddenly, stopping the advance of evil into my cell. After quickly dispatching the last two zombies, I filled in the remaining hole and went back to the doorway, just waiting for a sign that someone was coming.

Greg, so they split their remaining food rations evenly before advancing anywhere, just in case. Andrew refused to lead the way, volunteering Mark in his place. The two hadn't gotten along since our arrival on the island, and Andrew would probably be ecstatic if Mark died. Mark quickly refused the invitation to be the rat for this maze, and with no shortage of annoyance in his voice Greg announced he would be going first, again

With that settled, scared off by the hiss of spiders and under the impression that Aaron and I would have cleared away at least some of the webs in our exploration. Kyle attempted to keep a mental map of the turns they were taking, but quickly found himself unsure of his own memory and relegated himself to silence, along with Mark, who seemed too scared to say anything as they ventured deeper into the cave.

And suddenly, starting toward me quickly with Kyle, Mark and Andrew following close behind. And just as suddenly, pillars of gravel appeared from the ceiling, falling down to block their path to me. I could hear Kyle curse and then a moment later, curse louder as another side of the path was blocked off by gravel. I could just barely hear them through the trap wall as Kyle explained the situation - walls of gravel cut off every path but one. They had to take it.

*Hold tight

##Chapter 6: The Psychopath's Game

Andrew called a quick meeting before they continued. Something wasn't right. How could they have triggered the trap? There was no pressure plate, thinking about what could have done it when the sound of cave spiders hissing startled them into action. As they turned down the only remaining path, Kyle pointed out a sign sitting in the intersection ahead of them.

With some trepidation, the path they took to enter the intersection was suddenly closed off by gravel falling from the ceiling. Of course. They stared at the sign for a minute. It read:

`:D`

`Welcome`

Andrew broke the sign in anger as Greg, which led further away from me, had ""LLAFTIP"" on the second line; the far left path read ""NOTELEKS""; the middle path read ""AVAL"". Obviously, Pitfall, Skeleton, and Lava backward.

Greg put in an immediate vote for the Skeleton path, still silent, nodded. Again Greg took the lead, leading the group down a winding but otherwise empty hallway, always on the lookout for traps or danger. It was eerily quiet and lifeless, for a maze of death.

After another three turns, they froze. Staring grimly ahead of them, the group took in the path that lay ahead. Particles of lava dripped down from the ceiling and maybe 15 paces forward, a solid stone pillar rose to bisect the three block wide path. On either side of the pillar was a pressure plate, and two signs adorned the pillar. On either side of the path, gravel walls five blocks across hinted the possibility of a new trap.

The group, as the sounds of zombies and skeletons began to fill the air. They got close enough to read the signs.

`One of these buttons`

`Drops lava`

and

`The other`

`Drops walls`

Looking beyond the pillar and pressure plates, or walk back to pick a new path. Mark, who had been silent the entire time, hopped over one pressure plate and walked to the dead end three paces away, staring at the corner. Andrew made a snarky comment that just because he wasn't looking, didn't mean the danger wasn't real. Then came the sound of pistons, and suddenly a doorway opened up in front of Mark

In his surprise and eagerness to see what had happened

The left wall fell instead, iron swords drawn. Kyle and Andrew lit up most of the room easily enough, leaving only a small hallway in the back of the dungeon unlit.

I could hear them fighting on the other side of the wall, forcing me to switch to my old, wooden sword as I dodged an arrow from the skeleton and lunged forward to strike. In the other dungeon I could hear Andrew yelling and cursing, and Greg telling him to replenish his health back in the hallway. He ran out, and as I walked through the hallway into the other dungeon to reunite with my party, I heard a slam as Andrew pounded his keyboard.

In the bottom left hand corner of the screen

Kyle glanced into the hallway as Greg and I dispatched the last couple monsters, sure enough, the doorway Mark had disappeared into had opened up again. Not even bothering to check the dungeon's treasure chest, the three of us ran through the door and up a stone staircase, which exited into a large cavern, filled with waterfalls and lava flows and the occasional creeper and skeleton dotted in the distance.

We did it.

We were free!

Our group expanded a bit, i missed the last meeting, which was entirely roleplay, so i will give a breakdown here as far as i've heard:

* Spetrovi decided to take his goblin back to town and get drunk. Unfortunately

*  Dusk, being dusk, is being an absolute jerkwad to the shop owner. His patience runs short, and sets a spell to swap the three between their bodies (they keep their abilities, but have to switch stat pages, making them useless).
* Throzgar returns to his matron
* The three body swapped individuals meet up with Airde, they will give the pastor Davneiros' soul to use as an employee. (it should be noted that the reason they did this is because he was being lame and didn't show up to the session). They all agree, and get their bodies back
* Bengal and Airde pay a visit to Ziggs, who promptly freaks out. Bengal tries to throw Airde under the bus by holding him down, but fails his strength check, gets overpowered, and loses his grip. Airde then spartan kicks him down the stairs into the waiting arms of Ziggs, then runs out the door and puts a magical seal on it.
* the others just generally do their thing

Enter session 3. There are now two parties with two separate dm's

I am not part of group 1

* Airde enters a pet shop and meets the owner, ends up marrying her and inheriting the Pet shop
* Tabu gets to know the stable owner
* Dusk runs into some traveling salesman who try to sell him a crow. dusk fails his checks, he enters a shop and decides he wants it. It's at this point his luck turns around, and he then falls in love with the shop keeper's daughter.  Using his crow as aide, he begins burglarizing every single shop in the district. He spectacularly passes his checks, and manages to steal several thousand gp worth of items from everyone. Then, through some absolutely ridiculous story, bluffs hard enough to convince the entire town that the perpetrator is the owner of the shop. The silver tongued shade then convinces the daughter that he needs some super nerotoxic poison ""for, you know, who take out a contract with him to kill Bayne.
* other members do general rp stuff like buying armor upgrades


I probably left out a crapload of awesome stuff

Group two consists of myself, and Tabu.
We start off in the original district. 

**Tabu:**

Tabu awakens first. He greets the stable girl and heads to the mage shop. The mage has slightly less distates for him, and inquires about the price. The owner demands 500gp, which Tabu timidly replies to with an offer of some kind of compromise. A few minutes later, he and his mini-me are in a cellar peeling 7000 carrots for two hours. Upon completion, he purchases the robe for 50 gp and leaves.

**throzgar:**
Throzgar wakes up to find his matron missing. He heads down stairs and notices Franz, he works out that Franz is upset because the Matron left with a shady figure and ordered Franz not to follow, and he is now worried. Apparently, they were headed to the Galley.

**Comrade:**

Comrade awakes from his drunken stupor and realizes he's lost his goblin. ""well shit, marked with a magic blue X detectable only to Spetrovi. This flask is lined with a chemical that causes whoever drinks from it to become unconscious rather quickly. He thanks the barkeep and heads to the alchemist's to try and get some info.

Upon entering the Alchemists, and organized. Most noteable, The walls are now lined with bright pink potions in shiny bottles, and on the main wall hangs a massive portrait of a certain familiar Human Swordsman wearing nothing but a loin cloth. Glorious. He snags a black potion, which his magic senses tell him is deadly, and tries to open the door to the back. To his surprise, he is met with a magical barrier.  A quick arc lightning and magic missile drop the barrier

Upon reaching the bottom, Bengal is on all fours, panting. ""Oh noh, eet's you again. Where ees thee small one who works here?"" Bengal replies in a strange voice, and a noticible twitch reveals to spetrovi that Ziggs has possessed bengal's body. he tries to get information out of it, but zingal isn't budging. Spetrovi offers him some of the drink out of the magic flask, and he quickly collapses. ""Weel shit, and ties him up with every bondage device he can find

**cut back to throzgar**

Franz begins crying at this stage, he looks the giant in the eye and tells him ""I need your help, let's do it."" 

As soon as the words leave Throzgar's mouth, and tears across the city square in the direction of Galley. Tabu sees this, and follows after the two giants. Spetrovi emerges from the alchemist's, notices the runners, and dejectedly announces that ""i guess will be getting my exercise for thee day."" and pursues them.

Weird stuff happens down here and I Do. Not. Like. It. Early on, and there were no children, but nevertheless the wailing consumed me. I froze and my skin felt electrified. When it stopped, I turned to look at my friend to see if he was ok, hoping that he would be as unnerved as I was, but he was moving away down the tunnel as if nothing had happened. I kept my mouth shut. Why spook him?
 

The mutants are a problem. They make their presence known, and often in packs. My double barreled shotgun can't keep up with the pace of their attacks. Bourbon (that's my friend's name...) seems to be fine literally wrestling with the damn things, though.

 
The one time I thought we were in a safe place, didn't stand out to me for some reason. The next thing I knew, I was emerging from lightheadedness in a cramped tunnel, with Bourbon fifteen feet ahead of me, trying to open the same gate, but now the whole area was bathed in light from beyond the door. It was as if the gates were the gates to heaven, and beautiful blue and white light shone from beyond it. But this was no pearly gate, still grasping the big wheel that would open the gate.
 

And then I was back in the room with the dead bodies. Bourbon was at the gate, and the intensity of the light was matched only by what felt like wind coming from beyond it. I couldn't tell if it was wind or just a force, but it was pushing me back towards the room we were in, towards the bodies. We needed to get through the gate, but Bourbon was on his knees, yelling at someone or something, ""Come to me and I will sing your song forever!"" I grabbed at him, but I wasn't strong enough to stay on my feet. Like him
 

And then something reached towards me from outside my field of vision. It was a silhouette, and suddenly it was quiet again. We were in the next room, just a few feet from the gate. The light was gone, replaced by the damn dark hell as before. Bourbon recovered slowly, wondering aloud about what he had been saying and why. As is often the case, we didn't talk about it. We gathered ourselves and moved on.
 

After making our way through a number of giant tunnels and catwalks, rats being cooked on hastily assembled spits, gangs and thugs watching you, and the ubiquitous bar flies retelling their stories of survival on the surface.
 

After stocking up on air filters per my buddy's request, metal door slid open just enough for us to squeeze through, and we walked past the large caliber HMG that was bolted to the ground just inside the door. As the door closed, we heard some people calling my buddy's name in anger, screaming about unpaid debts. Looking back, they were running for the door, but it was already closing.

 
Bourbon looked at me
 

We made our way out of the building, at least. It looked like a gargoyle you might see perched on any old building, but huge, and decidedly louder. After a few moments of hiding behind the closest pillar I could scramble to, it flew off.
 

We moved out, and I crashed to the ground far below where Bourbon had jumped to. He yelled at me to get moving and meet him a ways away. ""Stay away from the water."" he added.
 

I spent the next hour wandering the abandoned Moscow neighborhood alone. It was all a blur; how many gray, but the five-round Shotgun I bought in the last town proved to be quite capable.

 
I often felt like I was being watched, so I forced myself to calm down.
 

At one point

 
I remember that my vision blurred for a moment, it ran off. I heard voices in my head, but I couldn't make them out. I don't know why I didn't shoot it. I should have, instinctively. It just didn't seem malevolent. Maybe it was curious. Whatever the case, I got the sense it was there for a reason.
 

I moved on. Hopefully I find Bourbon soon. I hear his gunfire from time to time. At least,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1368811673.0,video,,t3_1ej0zd

**Once you have posted

I set this up party because I'm so pleased we've managed to get an almost 50/50 split between traditional D&amp;D-type RPGs and video game stories - I'm really happy we've managed to keep up a mix of genres and not get dominated by one scene.

But also, and people here purely for the stories can easily ignore any socialising if they want to.

However, and a free-flowing story and creative problem solving in Tabletop.

1364735926.0,1bcu80,Tales from Dark Heresy.,Urytion,15,1,2,"These stories are from my games of Dark Heresy, it means I am a member of a special order of assassins that only use bladed weapons. No guns.

Story 1. I got exploded.

We had tracked down a cult to their headquarters in a warehouse. After cutting our way through the guards we found the ""boss fight"" in the basement

I charged him and succeeded in doing some decent damage. The Heretic's turn. He draws a flame pistol and fires it at me. It does a little damage. Tech Priest's turn. He aims and fires his Laspistol at the heretic, the GM announces that the arm has caught fire. Including the gun. It explodes. I had to burn a fate point* to stay alive. I still got knocked across the room by the explosion and hit the wall, knocking me unconscious. This is why I hate las weapons.

Story 2. Meatpaste.

In our next campaign we are tracking down hereteks (Heretics of the Machine Cult). We are walking down a long, poorly armed and armoured heretek jumps out from behind a pillar, so the cleric blasts him. He rolls so well on the damage, that the GM declares him ""Meatpaste"". Demanrisu, in his infinite wisdom, saw fit to fill his pockets with said paste.

Later, 3 levels later. Deman's turn. In desperation, he throws the meatpaste at the assassin's face (Called Shot). GM rolls it. Success. He succeeds so well that the Assassin is knocked the ground and blinded. I decapitated him.

Next turn rotation, we are sure to carry meatpaste on us at all times.

Story 3. Planetkiller.

At the climax of the Heretek Campaign we were in space, pretty much alone. Our Tech-Priest hacks into the main administrator terminal, deciding how to deal with the problem.

The suggested solutions were:

* Increase power to the orbital thrusters to send it hurtling into space.
* Turn off life support so the Imperium can reclaim it.
* Turn off the orbital thrusters to send it hurtling into the planet below.

The Tech-Priest, he was exiled from his own cult.

Story 4. Heist Prep failure.

The next campaign was (supposed to be) an Ocean's 11 style heist. We arrived on a tribal (think Mesoamerica, our contact. We go to a nearby village to ask for directions. To prove our worthiness, we must prove our honour. I decide to do this by fighting in THE PIT.

Their champion faces me in honourable combat, I had the company Psyker help me from the sidelines, by forging the opponent to spasm and suffer pain. In the end, I won, becoming the new Tribal Champion. I received a suit of full metal armour, and a powerful two handed sword, and my duties include leading the tribe to battle. Cool.

So we travel to Blood's base, we found a room containing a giant lizard. After NOPE'ing right out of there, we find a room with a giant vat of poison bolted to the floor in the middle. I unscrewed it from the ground, and the Tech-Priest and Hulk-esque guardsman, picked it up, carried to the lizard room, and poured it in. After waiting a little while, satisfied

We find Blood, riding atop trained lizards, of which he just finished training the prototype (welp, game over.)

*Fate Points

Burning a fate point is a very serious thing. It allows you to succeed on any roll, and can only get more by accomplishing ""impossible"" acts, like single handedly holding a fortress, or slaying a great daemon.

Firstly the map we were playing on for this particular story was Waterworks. The players in best to worst skill level were myself, Randall, and Rick. The game variant was CTF, a special house rule of no using vehicles for flag carries. This is important, because we ignored this rule, no one minded due to the insanity that followed.


The teams are myself and Justin vs Jacob, with it being our turn to capture. The game has been slowly slipping away from us as the timer ticks away. At last we're down to our last minute when our previous assault ended up in failure. With the seconds ticking down I respawn in base, running out and hopping in the warthog driver's seat. Justin sees this and hops in the turret to provide a fair amount of cover fire in case their are snipers atop their base. We drive for one last heroic effort, the sound of the engine was heard by all in the room. The snipes came in from the sniper spawn location from Jacob, no surprise. We manage to get to the base with no damage thanks to Justin's suppressing return fire. I immediately hop out of the driver's side after peeling it out right into their front entrance. I clutch my Shotgun, which I'm aware everyone starts with, along with the Battle Rifle. I toss in a frag grenade to create a smokescreen as I check the immediate corner to my right. Nothing. I continue sidestepping into the second corner, he fires and misses, I throw a frag grenade and hope for the time needed to deal with Jacob. Right in my face he comes at me


I don't take a moment to savor the small victory. I clutch the flag, desperately trying to catch us with one of his two frags. We escape.


""GOGOGOGOGOG!"" I scream as we head out, the sound of our enemies shouting just feet away is nothing but background noise. Justin veers left, heading for the center complex. Adrenaline from excitement quickly amps up one more level with a cold terror. ""Don't GO ON THE BRIDGE."" I shout it two more times. ""DON'T GO ON THE BRIDGE, DON""T GO ON THE BRIDGE."" We continue towards a teenage stress induced heart attack.


As we rise to the small mound proceeding the bridge Justin makes a 90 degree turn to avoid the bridge. At this point, another 90 degrees. Right at the ledge.


All hope is lost, the travel on foot should be safe, if I can just make it out. I think for a moment I might just do it. My feet touch down, it's solid... NO! I missed it by mere pixels! As I fall in disbelief I throw the flag, for it shall not meet us in this pit of doom. I look up at it firmly planting itself on the bridge.


But wait... we have 15 seconds... 10 seconds as the black screen and respawn timer eats away at my hopes. 5 seconds I plant myself in our Ghost... Round Over.


I sit there


That day I made a promise to avoid teaming up with Justin


I may not have won many games vs A Left Turn

**(ending of Part 2

It was a good enough stopping point as any, and asked how he managed to do it. Aaron explained that he was at Mark's house - that's why Mark hadn't said a word, both of their mics were muted so we wouldn't hear anything to give them away - and he was following in a room he had constructed above them, where he had created everything from the drop-walls to the lava trap that we unfortunately never got to see. I felt a bit left out, I was trapped in my prison cell the whole time!

Mark offered to unban Andrew now that the game was finished

""What do you mean

The stage was set for one final showdown now, and Greg, Kyle and I were excited to see what they would come up with.

###Part 3: The Final Showdown

The week crawled along as Kyle, who were helping Aaron set up the final battle, offered much information in our email correspondences, just leaving us with lines like ""You'll see"" and ""Trust me, it's worth it.""

Saturday finally came and I chose not to go to the Mets game with my family that day - Minecraft was more important. At noon exactly

We logged in to the server and immediately noted that our way was blocked on all sides by a gravel wall that was at least 10 blocks high. Aaron typed in chat ""Are you ready to face your death?"" We equipped our weapons

We heard the sound of pistons, trying to take in our surroundings. We were still in the giant cavern we had escaped into last week, but there was something different about it now. 

The waterfalls that had interspersed the lava flows along the walls were gone, far away from us, adorned on either side by torches. the floor was bare and level, except for a two-block wide ring depressed in the floor that surrounded a square in the center of the cavern that was maybe 10 blocks around.

Tentatively, Aaron you bastard.* Almost on cue, the iron door on the other side of the room swung open, and Aaron stepped through, clad from head to toe in golden armor and wielding a diamond sword. He walked confidently toward us and as he moved away from the back wall, lava began to flow freely down it, covering everything but the door in red death and giving the traitor an evil red glow as he continued forward without so much as a flinch.

In a show of confidence or foolishness, more cautiously. We reached the arena first, noting that the depressed ring of blocks was gravel. We knew what was going to happen.

Aaron stood outside of the ring, on a two-block wide path of cobblestone, as the gravel ring fell away into the nothingness below. Only a small bridge on the other side remained. Our only escape. And Aaron stood guarding it.

I charged forward hoping to catch Aaron by surprised, but receiving two hefty slashes from his Diamond Sword in return. I was forced to quickly retreat and eat my first of three loaves of bread as Greg and Kyle ran up to fight as well. Each of them had an iron sword, and would be able to do much more damage than I could. Together they held the edge of the arena, trying to keep Aaron pinned down while dodging back from his attacks.

Kyle managed a lucky strike on Aaron as he lunged toward Greg, eating my remaining loaves of bread and recovering from the grievous wounds I had received. Kyle again managed a hit on Aaron, but took a slash from him in return, forcing him back to heal up.

Aaron hopped back onto the arena, but he didn't care. He turned his sights on me and ran headlong toward me, and I couldn't run away fast enough. His blade smashed into me hard enough to send me flying backward and down into the deep pit surrounding the arena. I knew I was dead. I could only hope Aaron didn't prevail!

Greg and Kyle grouped up again as they watched me disappear over the edge, the cockiness in his voice growing as the miner and captain stood quietly, swords raised together against him.

In a move of confidence, still waving his sword and laughing at his adversaries, as more lava began to stream down the walls around the cavern. This time, though, it didn't disappear beyond the walls - it filled the cavern floor, slowly creeping toward the arena from the side we had escaped the maze of death, threatening to flood the entire place.

Greg and Kyle realized they needed to kill Aaron

""Run for it!"" Greg yelled, scanning the wall and floor around the door for some way to open it, they realized there was nothing there. No way to escape.

Now backed up to the door with lava streaming down from the ceiling in multiple places and covering the floor in death

Greg stood grimly, Kyle sprinted forward and smashed his sword against the scarred gold armor. Aaron laughed as he watched the pitiful and futile display, but as he was knocked back by the force of the strike he realized his fatal mistake. He landed in a puddle of molten lava, too stunned to react. And with one final, agonizing scream of pain, he was swallowed up by the glowing death he had created.

Kyle and Greg watched with morbid satisfaction as Aaron's body burned in the lava, leaving only them and the arena in the center uncovered. Andrew and I had fallen victim to the demonic machinations of the traitor, and Mark was nowhere to be found. Their expedition had turned into a twisted game of survival, and there would be no reward for winning.

Suddenly, and then to Kyle. Together. They would go forward together.

As they walked inside, extending straight farther than the eye could see. Together, Kyle and Greg walked, their footsteps echoing through the emptiness of the stone walls, neither one in the mood to speak.

What seemed like an eternity later, with blue sky streaming through the window. The two survivors sprinted forward, toward the first sky they had seen in days. Kyle threw open the door, and together they stepped out into the world.

###Epilogue

After the epic end to the story, deleted the world forever.

The six of us played together for a few more months before slowly starting to drift away from Minecraft and on to other games (most notably League of Legends and eventually Diablo 3 as well). We had other great worlds and stories, teach us the basics of redstone after it was all over (no, none of us really knew how to use that stuff before this). Writing this made me remember why I used to love Minecraft so much though, and I just might go back and play it again now.

So me and my friend Tim had been playing DayZ for some time, bought the game to play with us. So he spawns in around Cherno and we meet up with him to head up to Stary Sobor for some gear. On the way we see a crashed chopper and Ash gets a Bizon 9mm (For those that don't know it has a very fast fire rate), me and Tim have an M14 and a M16 respectively. 

We get to Stary at night and loot most of the tents there by torch light with no problem, he was holding the torch. By this point I'm on about half health.

(Quick diagram of the situation http://gyazo.com/b7fb76573e5be5020356dc714dc8ffb8
we are inside that big tent watching up the slope for a light to appear)

So Tim suggests that we make a break for one of the houses in Stary for better cover, night-time = literally 0 light, so the only way we could get to a house is if we throw a flare or use our torches, but then possibly get picked off by the shooter on the slope. 

We decide to risk it and I throw a flare out towards the town; almost immediately shots start to ping past our heads and we charge towards the nearest house. Me and Tim burst through the door

But that isn't the end of this encounter yet, we are coming for you.""**, so we know there are a few of them at least and Tim, being the asshole that he is, begins to taunt them over global chat.

After a few minutes of back and forth on global chat, it was proximity/direct. Just as I feel the sudden panic manifest itself I hear a loud bang and I go unconscious. I tell Tim and Ash I'm going to bleed out soon and Tim realises we are pretty outclassed, what with a completely new player on our team. So he says **""Right, fuck this I'm going out with a bang."".** Me and Ash ask him what the hell he is talking about when he does it...

**""WHAT IS LOVE...BABY DON'T HURT ME. DON'T HURT ME. NO MORE.""**

He had one of those virtual microphones on his computer and was using it to play Haddaway down his mic on GLOBAL chat. Now this was a fairly populated server

Suddenly 2 guys burst through the back door (This is what Tim had told me because at this point I was pretty much dead), of course) pelts the walls, ceiling, floor, TIM and pretty much anything that isn't hostile with his ridiculous gun. Luckily he and Tim tag the last guy enough to finish him. Ash eventually yells **""I'M OUT OH GOD *shaky breath and half cough half laugh* I CAN'T BREAT- *continues laughing*.""** Tim begins to bleed out from all the gunfire and eventually dies while yelling at Ash to heal him, but he still chuckling to himself.

I carefully approach a barn where I had found some good loot previously.  I'm careful to check the area from the tree line before going out in the open.  I carefully make my way to the barn without alerting any zombies.

I'm inside looting stuff, a guy runs into the barn with several zombies behind him.

""Friendly!  Don't shoot!"" he says.  I immediately regret not having my mic on.  I tried to type ""friendly"" to him, and there are several zombies entering the barn.  From previous experience I know shooting the zombies is going to bring more zombies.

The uncertainty of the situation was too much, I'm out of here.  So I sprinted out of the door, realizing I'd probably attract a few zombies, but that was preferable to this.

""Don't you run from me!""

Oh shit.

The guy starts shooting me in the back.  I zig zag, and in this game, it doesn't take much to die.  So I spin around and start firing back.  At this point, my nerves are on edge, the adrenaline is pumping, and my aim is not that great.

But my return fire is enough to make him hit the deck.  I'm not sure at this point if I killed him, at the very least, I've bought some time while he has to stand up again before chasing me.

I make it to the trees, but I'm still bleeding out pretty fast and there are still zombies behind me.  When I think I've lost the stranger, I decide to make my stand against the zombies.  I need to bandage soon or I'll bleed out, and there's no way I can outrun the zombies in that time.

1 dead zombie

2 dead zombies

Start to bandage...
in the process of bandaging...
a third zombie comes running in..
no time to finish bandaging...

3 dead zombies.

1367720069.0,1dpml2,[Battlefield 3] The Corner,AFunnyThing-,18,7,3,"It was a bright day on the Sine. Last week, what difference a few men and about a thousand rounds of ammunition make.

As for me? Me and my crew were shipped in from another front to support the forward action. After that whole ""Operation Firestorm"" fiasco against the Americans

Me and my boy Berserker had been called in to support the French front. The American presence in there was heavy, ""Home Sweet Home""). I had met Berserker in basic - he was one of the best shots in the entire military (not that it's saying a lot. These days it felt like they were enlisting 14 year old kids to fly the choppers straight out of rudimentary school).

Berserker and I made a quick to-do of studying the map and looking over the current battle scenario. It was damned near another Firestorm fiasco again... Americans were flanking the hell out of all the positions and it looked damned near impossible for the forces to get anywhere. They had a tank set up on the main street

I cocked my LMG

""Looks like it's time to earn our bread and butter

""If you think you can keep up

As anyone who's seen a few battles will tell you, making our way to Monument Square to support the faction there. It was a quick counter-attack - a short victory, to be sure, over an enemy who was currently more focused on attacking our little base than holding the nearby areas. They would roll through soon though, so Berserker and I left the damned kids tho their foolhearted fate and continued to press into enemy territory.

We soon found ourselves moving through an alleyway, clicking my flashlight on and off every few seconds to hopefully blind an unwary enemy.

But, scouting out the windows for possible enemies when we both made an observation. Berserker, of course, vocalized his:

""Hey... We can cover the entire road from here."" He said

""You know, ""the second we start firing out of here, they'll be over us like gnats on a steak right?""

""You're sounding like a pussy right now, checking the sights. ""Besides, when have you ever let the idea of death get in the way of living?""

""Cut the poetic bullshit, signalling to the rest of the units where we were, and we settled in. He looked over the field, and I was beside him. The first shot was always the best - as Berserker put it - because the name of the game was to not get discovered for as long as possible. The less people shooting at you, the better, right?

""Back one. Enemy base."" I said. ""The sniper. We're better off without having someone who can drop us in one sh-"" I heard the quiet thump of a silenced rifle.

""Done."" He said

Through the barrel on my scope I could see them hustling about. IT took all about 5 seconds for them to begin firing at us. I breathed out

""Eight. Get on my level."" He said. ""My apologies. Nine.""

""Bullshit, repositioning myself to overlook the other part of the intersection - a nice little Cul-de-sac with a staircase with plenty of enemy traffic running through it - and popped up my rifle, reloading. ""You haven't even pulled the trigger nine times."" I snapped the new set of rounds into the rifle, and pulled back the action.

*Thump!* ""I have now. Ten."" He laughed like an idiot.

""You're telling me that you killed two people with on-"" that's when I saw it whistling by my head, I put a few slugs downrange into the source of the attacker, ending his life in a few, quite loud THUDS.

""Berserker?!"" I said

""Yeah, slowly standing up, shaking off the dust from his uniform. ""Nice call, jackass. Do you hate losing THAT bad?""

""Fuck you, laughing and looking over the side. ""Well, I think we have their attention. Got any more bright ideas?""

""Yeah. We kill them all. Problem solved, laying down covery fire on their positions as Berserker popped back up and positioned himself on the ledge. One shot, two shot, three shot. Rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat. The area around us was cleared faster than you could say ""Knife.""

I moved to reposition to my old spot, and the dish was bullets.

""One hundred!"" I shouted

""Berserker?"" I asked, with his knife out. A set of dogtags in his hand. Looks like he'd won in the end after all... After a few solemn seconds, the shots began ringing out again as I checked over the side. They were swarming on my position, and they had pulled the tank around to provide heavier fire, which was ripping the building to shreds.

Out of ammo, Knife out, waiting. One down, two down, three down. Pistol out, shots fired, Five down.

""Goodbye.""

Click. Boom. No more tank.

1365851174.0,1c9ifb,[HL: Opposing Force] The Mundane Soldier in a Fantastic World,Skafsgaard,17,5,0,"This is something I wrote a couple of years ago, since it's a tale of a very unique game experience. Feel free to downvote it, and it's been too long since then for me to remember any details to finish the story. In any case

I'm doing a run on hard, no crosshair, no armour, no night vision, and only a (human (no alien or experimental weapons)) primary weapon, a side arm, a melee weapon and explosives like grenades and satchels

But since you can't actually drop weapons in this game, for example, for a new one, I just bind 3 to a different primary weapon, but restricting myself from doing so, unless I actually come upon the weapon I am binding 3 to, in the game world. I will then allow myself to at a later time go back to the place where I changed binds, to 3.
It's not perfect

Here's some details about my game.
I've bound the following keys.

1: Knife

2: Desert Eagle

3: Primary weapon (Mostly Shotgun, or because of a situation where it fitted better as well as access to the grenade launcher. After mostly using the Shotgun for most of the game, I switched to the Sniper Rifle for a while, as it is seriously hard hitting - incidentally I adopted much more stealthy tactics then. After running dry on Sniper ammo, I had stocked up enough SAW ammo to make it worthwhile, so up until now the SAW has been my primary weapon, rather than just an occasional weapon - luckily there's alot more ammo for that weapon in this last part of the game.)

4: Grenade

5: Satchel

6: Tripmine

Other: I've used the barnacle, with no other ways to continue. I did, however, manage to get past the gargantuan on the bridge, however, without using it. I waited for it to charge up it's stomp-attack, and ran past it then. I did get some burns

I used the noclip cheat in the beginning of the game in order to avoid picking up your PCV suit

So far, which is the Black Ops mortar launcher area.

With no, no crosshair (which is independent from the rest of the HUD, but I have disabled it through the console), no nightvision (as it's tied to the PCV suit) on hard difficulty, and with a very limited arsenal, it's been tough so far. Another restriction is that I only use human, military weapons. So no alien or sci-fi guns for me. I've only loaded my autosaves upon death too, ammo and health - I've been down to one health on several occasions.

With the limited weaponry, such as shotgun at long range, or explosives/sniper bullets on enemies that were too dangerous in melee but still fairly weak.
I've also ended up stuck with a ""useless"" weapon several times, due to fighting aliens in that area.

There have been some really tough fights

The absolutely most impossible part I've been until now, topped only by the gargantuan and maybe the chopper. Usually, they wouldn't be much trouble, but I was lacking the fire power to actually take them on. In each of the two parts of the sewer there were, I believe four Voltigores, as well as a bunch of Baby Voltigores. Even so, that was not the worst. The worst part of that area was that the whole mazy area was completely and utterly pitch black darkness

In the first part of the sewers, and 4 or 5 shots obliterated it. The other three Voltigores in that sewer were avoidable.
Then came the middle part of the sewers, I still can't believe I actually managed to get through that maze, filled with Voltigores, in pitch black darkness, with no night vision. I did that so many times, over and over again.

I finally learned to navigate by having my Desert Eagle out, and being able to navigate by them, when they would charge up their purple energy attack. Their attacks were clearly visible, but they did not illuminate. I felt a lot like learning by oneself to navigate by the stars, on the sea, in that I had to come up with a new method for navigation.

SAW ammo has become a lot more plentiful in this part of the game
I have to make every shot count though. I can't spray. I need to head shot. I need to really take advantage of my environment. And I need to put my allies to the best use

I have ascended once in Slashem before this (Cha-Fem-Dro-Wiz)
what I really want to talk about is the time I ALMOST ascended...

This story has several titles
of this post:
YAFAP
There IS Something Worse Than YASD

but the real title is:

Why I Can't Drink Scotch

This all happened about two years ago
passed and I actually did ascend
crying.

Misery was a Fem-Hum-Val
finished reading.

My friends tried to warn me that this name was inauspicious
held to the practice
offspring after some terrible calamity (e.g. Marid = ""sickness"")
the hopes of diverting that calamity.

So Misery was born.  Her childhood was uneventful
13
change her life forever
allegiance to Odin
the ways of war
that she had been chosen to enter the Dungeons of Doom and win eternal
glory by liberating the ""oY.

Odin... not Tyr.

So she entered the Dungeon.  Her journey was long
several years ago
recall that she received Mjollnir early in her adventure
gauntlets of power shortly thereafter
mothafudga at every damn thing she saw.  Once she lost it in a moat
stupidly trying to take out a giant eel
realized that she could get it back...

Also
/oC into a BoH... (since then
ever played has had to learn this lesson the hard way.  I can be
really stupid with the @ key sometimes.)

Anyway, and the rest went down like the little
beeyotches that they are.  Only big D put up a fight
a fight!  Misery tried every damn cutesy-pie trick she could think of
including but not limited to scrolls of earth
blobs
monsters to fight him
corpse.

And that's how Misery's uncursed +0 pickaxe became the uncursed +0
pickaxe named Demogorgonslayer.  (I know
that defeated him
just gonna rot away?)  (Of course
cockatrice corpse named Steve.)

So once my heart rate returned to normal
now that NOTHING could prevent her from fulfilling her obligation and
winning eternal glory.

...

A little background:  I was underemployed
a one-bedroom apartment with four other guys.  We had no less than
four NH stations in the house (counting the 386 laptop my roommate
scored at a garage sale for $20)
first to ascend.  I was not heavily favored.  My friends Eric
(estimated IQ: 200) and Jme (best time winning Axis &amp; Allies
as Germany: about 30 minutes) had both gotten characters into Gehennon
while I was still quaffing from the Oracle's fountains.

This friendly rivalry could sometimes get meanspirited.  For a while
instead of engraving Elbereth as a wand-tester
""Eric will never find the Amulet!"" :)

So when Misery started to show real promise
increased.  Eric and Jme started playing almost constantly (neither
had jobs)
deeper and kept filling out that Kit.  Even when I took a couple weeks
off (the further I got, I
remained the front-runner.

Then, and I
determined that I would ascend before nightfall.  This was gonna be
the big session
cock-of-the-walk.  I was gonna invite all my friends over to watch
thinking it would be convenient to have everyone in the same room so I
could gloat most efficiently.  And
made the mistake which caused the other mistake which caused me to cry
like a teething infant for (literally) hours.

I stopped in to the liquor store and bought a handle of Clan
MacGregor's Scotch Whiskey.

...

So, I Restoring Saved
Gamed to the bottom level of Rodney's tower.

Oh

sure

Valkyries before
Rodney's tower posed the slightest threat.

I whooped that Wizard so hard he cried
or three more times.  Although I know this sounds unlikely
that somehow Rodney had attained sentience (think Wintermute
crying and whining like a little beeyotch from the ferocity of the
beating Misery administered)
harassing me.

Moloch's Sanctum?  Pah!  More like Moloch's Spanked'em!

La de da, into the Valley, out of
the Castle, was
swarming with about 50 gremlins... hehe),
I've gotta get this Amulet to the Astral Plane!

By this time I had put away quite a bit of scotch
spectators had drifted away

something really stupid and fudge it all up.

So I reached DL1...

Beware

Uh oh... better check my inv...

Wait

Hehehe... congratulating myself on my careful playing
with the knowledge of how close I had come to throwing it all away
descended to where I had last slain Rodney.  There's the damn thing!
I up and walked away without it!

As Misery grabbed the Amulet
celebrated with a healthy belt.

Things were getting a little fuzzy by now... I tell a lie: things were
VERY fuzzy.  But dammit
down soon.  I had been trying for a year to get this far
not gonna wait one more damn day.  I wanted Demigoddesshood.  I
DESERVED Demigoddesshood!

Back to DL1... back to the stairs.  Have I got the ""?  Check.  4 ?oGD?
 Check.  4 or 5 B!oFH?  Check.  Everything B that should be?  Check.
/oD, and spares of everything?  Check.  Now half-empty
bottle of scotch?  Glugluglug

Elemental Planes?  Pah!  After staring down the barrel of a unicorn
horn at big D

Oh, you fudging sissy.

And so Misery entered the Astral Plane.  A tame A with a Sunsword
seemed almost comical.  My confidence level was so high I thought
about slaughtering him just to add one more to my list of creatures
vanquished.

The potion of Clan MacGregor had started out tasting like liquid fire
but by this time it was more like a potion of oil:  smooth.

Huh?  What?  Where am I?

The altar to the north was guarded by Pestilence
even a Horseman of the Apocalypse seemed very dangerous.  Misery waded
through a sea of beasties
returning Angels to Heaven
that would have put Thor himself to shame, stomping on
lots of bugs.  Pestilence didn't even get a chance to sick me; quick
zap of the old /oD put an end to his Ride.

And I stood on the altar.  I stood there for a good five minutes.  I

Let me just repeat that

Misery

Celestial Disgrace.

CELESTIAL DISGRACE.

Now
mistake of sacrificing the ""oY on the wrong altar which caused me to
cry like a teething infant.

That was a slight falsehood.

Teething infants don't know nearly as much profanity as I do.

Wordleslly I pushed the power button on the computer without even
Pressing ENTER to end.  I grabbed the !oBooze and headed out the door.
 Eric and Jme had not even spoken.  Even though we were rivals
were friends
They ESPECIALLY knew enough not to laugh.

If they had laughed

I went for a bit of a walk.  In fact
about a two mile round trip.  As I walked
like it was going the fudge out of style.  I seem to remember stopping
to puke by the side of the road.  (You vomit!  You can move again.)  I
lit cigarettes while I still had a half-butt burning.  I'm pretty sure
at some points I had three going.

Two words were bouncing around my soft brain... I bet you can guess
what they were... Here's a clue: the second one rhymes with misplace.

I considered throwing myself in front of the next city bus I saw
when I tried it
question wouldn't be moving for another ten minutes.

So I laid in front of it in the rain for a few minutes until the
rent-a-cop told me I had to get up
around with a half-gallon of scotch in my hand.  I pointed out that it
was actually only about 1/32 of a gallon of scotch
to understand what I was saying.

Suddenly there were two rent-a-cops
perhaps I was hallucinating and he was really a gremlin.

I suddenly vomited.  I could move again.  Everything looked SO boring
now.  As I heard the shrill sound of a guard's whistle
!oBooze

Then I either blacked out for a while or I stepped on a teleport trap
because suddenly I was back on my front porch.  I heard the sounds of
courtly conversation and maniacal laughter in the distance.  I tried
to open the door
to kick it again
a door open.  Jme was standing there with a look of pure compassion on
his face.  I stepped into his arms and started to cry.  Time stood
still as Jme and I lay in each other's arms.  I felt down in the
dumps.

Then suddenly I heard maniacal laughter close by.  Eric had been
trying to hold it in

The air crackled around me.  I pointed at Eric and cursed.

Jme chastized Eric
trying not to smile.

I explained that I had dropped the cursed potion of booze while
running from some K
nearest delicatessen to buy a new one.  When he returned
give me a !oFJ instead
 When I demured

Motherfudger.

I began quaffing from the new !oB
thought about Maud.

minimum of fuss.  You can be sure that I was mighty careful on the
Astral Plane that time

biologically contaminated slime mold juice.  And I've tasted that

this post

I remember a few other things about that fateful friday.  my
girlfriend came over and laughed at me

Misery was not
nearly lost Mjollnir
the big D.  late that night we used a magic marker to engrave
""6-14-02

threw that monitor off a roof.

Several things have stayed with me from the experience.  First and
foremost
that I would never ascend a Valkyrie in nethack.  For one thing
too easy
alive somewhere
to live out the rest of eternity in celestial disgrace... it just
wouldn't be right to start another Valkyrie.  What if she ascended and
took Misery's rightful place beside Odin in the heavens (or worse
beside Tyr!)?  The enormity of my error is already a fudging cursed
loadstone of guilt
damn scroll of punishment to go with it.

But the main thing is that I can't drink scotch anymore.

I used to play Minecraft a lot - certainly more than I do now. This story took place on one of the earlier post-official-release patches, and hearing their tales after the fact.

All names have been changed for privacy reasons. ""Chapters"" (for the most part) denote the end of a play session.

###Part 1: Voyage to the New World
##Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

I played Minecraft only exclusively with a small group of four friends

After going through multiple worlds, and after he assured us that Aaron would fit right in and get as into the roleplay as we usually did, we agreed that he could join us.

Andrew came up with the idea for the new world - an unexplored continent, document the various forms of wildlife and bring back samples of each, and collect enough treasure to bring back to the homeland and warrant a second, larger voyage.

Over a Skype call, and Greg decided on the role of ship's captain moonlighting as architect. I was the explorer/adventurer, tasked with mapping out the region.

After we had chosen our roles, in hopes of returning as a majestic hero, vanquisher of evil."" I wanted to keep it simple, you know?

We said our goodnights shortly after

##Chapter 2: The Voyage Begins

On Saturday at noon, a scientist skin for Mark, a dirty farmer skin recolored to look more like a miner's outfit for Kyle, and the same knight skin for both Aaron and Andrew, only their hairstyle and names separating them. As we all hopped in, we realized we were in the middle of the desert, and needed to start at the edge of an ocean (or at least a lake big enough where we couldn't see the other side) for our journey. We set out west

Greg immediately jumped into character, and began chatting him up about the prospects of discovering and fighting deadly monsters while we were here. Aaron put on a surly attitude, reminding me that all of our supplies had been washed away with our ship, and we were lucky to still be alive. If there really were enemies here, we'd need more than just our fists to beat them. Atop the dune, we noted that we could just barely see trees in the distance to the north, and went back to the group to let them know.

Mark seemed almost too excited when we got to the greener side of life, there was a wheat field within sight as well, which Mark and Andrew went to harvest while we chopped wood. Once we felt we had enough materials for a first night, we set up camp partway between the woods and the shore. Greg created two crafting tables, and began constructing a small house with Kyle and me, while Andrew and Aaron crafted torches, axes and swords. They, set up torches as the sun was beginning to set

We ate bread and discussed the plans for the next few days, and trekked back to base to inform the others. We returned to find that the rest of the group had been chopping down trees and foraging for more food during the day, and that there was already tension brewing between Andrew and Mark - Andrew was growing increasingly irritated by Mark's insistence to take a piece of each tree as a sample.

The next day we broke camp, but that all changed once night fell. We had our first encounter with a creeper, and it was only thanks to Andew's persistence that I didn't fight it (and probably get myself blown up). He drew the creeper a ways away and let it blow itself up before heading back to camp, where Aaron and I were busily fighting a spider and skeleton that had shown up. Greg noted my eagerness after the fight had ended, and warned me not to get ahead of myself. We weren't here to kill monsters.

We reached the mountain the next day and began exploring around its base, a map, and Mark was interested in what the subterranean ecosystem might hold. So all together, we set up camp on solid ground, prepared for our journey into the depths, and logged off. We would continue again next Saturday for more.

I must have been away from my computer when everyone left the Skype call, Andrew and Kyle left the call, Aaron and Mark stayed on for an extra 20 minutes. In the end I figured they were probably just chatting about non-Minecraft-related stuff, and shrugged it off. But eventually I would find out, that call marked the beginning of Mark and Aaron's machinations.

##Chapter 3: Swallowed by Darkness

Throughout the week, while I had slowly turned into the unbearably eager and excited (bordering on naive) young adventurer character. Greg was the seasoned old veteran who has seen more than his fair share of everything, and has enough wisdom to lead the group and enough to know when to let others lead. Kyle was a bit apathetic to the goings-on of the group, keeping himself focused on the task at hand. Mark was eager to get all scientific on the new continent, so much so that he was distancing himself from the group, even going so far as to act high-and-mighty to the group, because they didn't understand his work. Aaron, was keeping a fairly open view and a low profile. His character was probably the most ""real"" of all of ours

As Saturday rolled around and we got back into the game, can't forget bread). We ventured down through the cave, stopping to mine coal and iron when we found it, and stocking up on cobblestone as well, just in case. At the first major split, Greg and Mark stayed behind to set up a mini-camp while Kyle and Andrew took one path, and I went with Aaron down the other.

Our path turned steeply downward after a short while, inching our way downward. We managed to find some gold ore in the walls, and Aaron noted that we would have to come back for it. We had almost reached the bottom, finally, when I noticed something below: a cobweb, and a lack of lava. Which could only mean one thing. A mineshaft! I relayed this back to the rest of the group eagerly, and even though they technically couldn't react (since in the roleplay, we were all excited to explore it. Aaron and I decided we would head in a little deeper just to see what was directly around us

I can't remember how much time had passed, I noticed that there weren't quite as many cobwebs as I was used to seeing in a mineshaft. All I remember is finding a room where the mineshaft broke into a skeleton dungeon, beating our way through and torching the walls until they stopped spawning, and heading over to the chest to open it. And then Aaron laughed, and I turned around to face him. And there he was, almost finished building a wall of Obsidian across the dungeon's entrance. Suspicious, I quickly started mining the wall on the opposite side and, behind the outer layer of stone was more Obsidian. He had this trap set up in advance

Now, and doesn't drop an Obsidian block. That can only mean that Aaron, somehow, had enough time to mine his way up to a Diamond pickaxe, find and mine enough Obsidian blocks for this trap, and then lead me down here. It was something that would've taken at least a couple hours of solid gameplay to pull off, and definitely *not* something he could've done during our one-and-a-half game sessions so far.

We were all pretty confused until Mark chimed in. Aaron had been talking with Mark after everyone left the Skype call last week

Andrew and I seemed the most upset about this breaking of the rules. Usually, but whatever the case was, we certainly weren't in the mood to play anymore that day. We stopped early and I left the call almost immediately.

Aaron struck up a new email conversation with our party the next day, which he would rule over until the day he died. It took until Wednesday for us to finally agree to keep going. I still had my reservations, since boxing me in with obsidian was a pretty common griefing move, but this time, at least, I would be ready. I thought there wouldn't be any more surprises.

I needed to stop making assumptions.

(Well that's a lot of writing so far

It was a couple months back, that really caught my interest. 

They fought in a couple of brutal matches after Wrestlemania. An awesome submission match on a random episode of Raw where Ziggler won after putting Jack to sleep with a Sleeper Hold. After the match i was very surprised that Ziggler wanted to shake Cactus' hand after they nearly killed each other in a 20 minute epic. Cactus smacked Ziggler's hand and walked away frustrated. 

After the match i was surprised to see in the News column that Cactus Jack turned his back on the fans by not showing respect to Ziggler. Even though Ziggler was a full blown heel (A Heel is a Villain while a Face is a good guy

Before the match Ziggler and Jericho got into an argument over who would start the match. Jericho won the argument and Ziggler went onto the apron (Behind the ropes where a Tag partner usually goes). During the match about 10 minutes in after Jericho tagged in Ziggler, Cena walked into the ring and knocked Cactus out and also left the ring.

The match was pretty heated but after a few minutes of them trading punches and suplexes. Cactus landed his special move

Ziggler fought Cactus at Extreme Rules in an Extreme Rules match. A brutal match where blood was spilled and both men gave it their all. After 24 minutes (Which is pretty long for a wrestling match), 3 and won the match. It was quite possibly the greatest culmination of a feud i've ever seen in a wrestling video game. I stood up and literally started clapping at how fluid and awesome that ending was. His music hit and instantly the crowd went nuts. Ziggler was all bloodied up that night but the adrenaline kept the pain away and he was able to overcome one of the greatest hardcore legends in the history of Wrestling.

I grasp my friend's hatchet firmly and crouch behind a large bush near the pair of corpses. He approaches his handiwork cautiously, hatchet in hand.

[entry 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1fmyzk/dungeons_and_dragons_4e_the_journal_of_broon_a/)

A lot has happened in such a short time.  I don’t know just exactly where to begin…
	
I’ll start with what happened immediately after the soldier crumpled after we destroyed the orb that possessed him.   He was unconscious, and while on Branimir and Easy Torinn’s watch, the soldier awoke.  We had taken his weapons, so he was flailing around, rampaging through until I managed to get him into a headlock.  He calmed down, saying his name was Berix.  

Berix was on the borders of Salthirn with his fellow soldiers, when everything went black.  Apparently, the ‘bandits’ were just simple farmers, who were similarly possessed.  He was anguished when he did not find the rest of his comrades, believing he had hunted and slain them.  Branimir, however, suggested that perhaps Berix’s friends were on separate hunts.
Berix was obviously anguished

We took shifts again, when I noticed something in the trees.  Something… white.  

I called out to it

How can this be possible?  She died.  I saw her head on a spear

I told her my excuses, like it seems to be when I was hunting, when everything slowed down as I stalked a deer.
	
My mother left me
	
Morning dawned, but my instincts tell me we’ll see more of Berix in our future.  That’s aside the point, however.  We roamed a tiny bit through, scoping out, when a young man around the age of 12 ran by, taking our coin purses.  

Torinn and I ran after the boy, and I threatened him.  After what happened to the boy, the words I whispered to him still stick in my head…

“First, since they’ve already paid me.  In blood.  And they regret stealing from me for the rest of their days.  Which really isn’t long, most only last a few hours.” 

The boy confessed at this threat.  He needed the money to pay off his debt to the Thieve’s Guild.  We let him go, having a meal and resting down.  I felt suspicious that night, so we posted a guard.

This did not help.
	
We woke up to find, and to meet him at the Silk Whispers Inn.  Branimir and I decided to stay at the inn, in case the man came back.  Zeharia and Easy Torinn, meanwhile, went on their way to find the child who we had hired to find Narith’s father.  

The boy was dead.  Poisoned.  And abandoned on the streets by the guards

Torinn questioned the guards

We decided to go to the Silk Whispers Inn, using everything to get him to recognize us: the ring, Honor in Family, the mentioning of the words on the wall, but he didn’t recognize us.

Zeharia tried to stop him, then he crumpled to his knees, shaking.  And the man was gone.

1366398309.0,1coxix,[Sub Rosa] An Epic Shootout,YuEnDee14,13,1,2,"Sub Rosa is an entire game that can basically be distilled into stories fit for /r/gametales. Here's one of mine. But before I tell you the story

Sub Rosa is a game of deceit and communication. The game is split into three teams, but is generally frowned upon. There are also three way deals where each team has a disk and must trade with two other teams to get the disk they need, a simple race around the map, and a mode called Acquisition. This story takes place in an Acquisition round, where you are tasked with killing NPCs driving around the map and taking the disks they're carrying.

As my team and I spawned in (I believe there was also a few other people spread across other teams, so I purchased a faster car with money I'd saved up. I was in this car alone, while my teammates followed me in the standard towncar. As soon as the round started, I raced out of our garage, heading to one of the main roads where the NPCs were most likely found.

I turned a corner, and we quickly immobilized the car, leaving the man carrying the disk for later. I continued down the main road at high speed, and saw the other NPC car coming down a side street towards the road I was on. I had already passed the side street, so I threw on the handbrake and sent my car into a perfect 180 degree drift. I was now driving in reverse, watching the NPC car turn onto the main road as my teammates stopped to execute the NPC we'd immobilized and take his disk. 

As the other NPC began driving down the main road, I began going up a hill, and the NPC followed. Just as we reached the peak of the hill, I'd done enough damage to the car for it to wreck (the cars kind of explode, but no damage is done to the occupants). As the car exploded, it launched itself over the crest of the hill, tumbling through the air as the NPC inhabitants looked at me helplessly. One of my teammates got a lucky headshot on one of the NPCs, not smart enough to leave their car, headed home,self

For way of explanation

&gt;*Disclaimer: I've told this story a few times

&gt;I've played a single campaign in L5R. I think what stood out most to me was my rival. I played a Lion bushi with a hardline approach to honour

&gt;He wasn't even my idea

&gt;By the end we had started out as friends; I the loyal subject from a branch family and he the scion of the main house. He was a somewhat troubled sort, in a small sake house. He was he leader of a band of ronin, while I was just passing through. One thing led to another, he made some drunken remarks and we had a duel. It was a close call, but I cut him down on the first exchange and left him bleeding but alive on the floor. I monologued at him for a bit and left.

&gt;We met again a couple of times after that. Now he was the bodyguard of a Phoenix shugenja

&gt;Some words and actions later and our differences were to be settled with a duel. I faced him on the cold and wind-swept beach at dawn. I had the ancestral sword but he wore enchanted armour. He was the superior duelist

&gt;We only settled matters at our third duel. By then I had been promoted to Shireikan and was one of the handful remaining senior officers of the Akodo. I was in charge of the defence of Swift Sword Castle, but we held them off with minimal losses. Which is when he got reinforcements. And so did we; the Kitsune shugenja had laboured for days to open a gate to the spirit realms and called on the ancestors directly. We sortied and charged their camp.

&gt;In the midst of the pitched battle I came across him. I cut down his bodyguards with a single stroke (it was a pretty high-powered game at this point) and again it came down to a duel. My battle horse was a gift from the Ox Clan

&gt;Again and again we rode at each other. By our sixth exchange I had cut down his horse and his shadow power was exhausted. But he was unhurt and my left arm hung useless. Again it came down to the wire

&gt;**Footnote:** The campaign ended soon thereafter and we were allowed to craft our own epilogues. My character retired to a temple after a long life of accomplishments. He handed over the ancestral sword to the most promising of his students; who happened to be the grandniece of his rival.

The squad is deployed along a narrow alley in Shanghai

Snipers Ice and Eagle are positioned at the rear of the alley, along the sides of the alley. The team's heavy, Ogre, is positioned behind a police car, ready to fire his rocket launcher if called on. 

Flash, shotgun in hand. Just as she gets into position, the door opens. A Berserker bursts out, not even seeing Flash as it charged out into the open. 

Luckily, and sniper shots pepper the beast. Incredibly, it remains standing after the assault. As it turns, setting it sights on Flash, two Mutons from inside the room take cover behind the door, firing out into the alley. Cross takes a hit, but shakes it off and returns fire. 

""Cross

""Yellow

The squad is shaken but standing strong; the Beserker is nearly dead and the Mutons pose at most a minor threat on their own. With but a moment's hesitation, blows the head off one of the Mutons. As it goes down, a single sniper shot from Ice finishes off the Berserker. Cross, seeing her opportunity, moves forward and reloads, getting into position to bring down the final Muton...

It was the wrong move. Suddenly

""CROSS!"" bellows Support Smoke. He stand from his crouch

""Hold position Smoke! We need to get that thing away from her first"" the Commander quickly orders. ""Flash

Without bothering to reply, but the second ricochets off the monster's armor. The Berserker complies with gusto, immediately turning and running to her. 

Things quickly get worse. From a side alley, opening fire with its gattling laser. From only 10 feet away, with no cover between it and Flash, there is no way it can miss...

Somehow, manages to duck beneath the shot. She's survived for the moment, but she is in a very ugly position. 

""Ogre

""Thought you'd never ask"" replies Ogre as he hefts and fires into rocket launcher into the tightly packed machine group

Smoke cuts into the radio channel, if I don't get over there...""

""You're clear

As Smoke runs to try and save Cross, but she manages to avoid the worst of it. She runs, reloading as she goes, desperately trying to put distance between her and the enemies as she bleeds from a dozen wounds.

Her attempts are in vain. The Cyberdisk, knowing she is facing death and determined to take the bastard with her. It begins its launch...

By this point, the snipers in the back of the alley were busy getting into position on top of the buildings on either side of the alley, using their grappling hooks to ascend. Just as the Cyberdisk was preparing to finish off Flash, a shot rings out from Ice; it thuds into the floating beast, interrupting its attack. A second shot, coming from Eagle on the adjacent roof, goes wide. 

""Heh

Flash doesn't waste any time celebrating. She ducks behind cover and opens fire onto the Berserker

The final Muton, Ogre and Smoke open fire, lighting it up but failing to bring it down. It pulls out its plasma rifle and aims it at Flash...

""Redemption

A single shot is heard from Eagle's roof. The bullet flies across the open space, falls to the ground dead.

""Shit yeah!"" Eagle shouts from his rooftop

""Eagle

Before Eagle can reply, get over to Flash and treat her. Eagle, cover Ice and Ogre while they reload. Once you've been treated, Flash I want you to move into and clear the building the Berserker came from....""

 We wait for the first wave of American soldiers supported by heavy armor to attempt to breach our line. Below, then, I as they came closer, we could make them out. A medium sized attack force lead by three tanks and two buggies in a triangle formation hurtled toward our line. The line below simply rippled, for lack of a better word. There were rockets, hundreds of bullets, and tracer darts flying toward the advancing Americans. One of the tanks explodes as a well placed TOW missile smashed through the treads and sets the tank ablaze. At this point, leading the American strike force by at least 200 meters.


  The Americans are firing everything they have, earth shattering cannon blast, and the secondary machine gun opens up. I raise my GOL and take aim at the advancing infantry, slightly behind the tanks. I fire a shot, and the bullet falls comically short and makes a puff in the dirt just before a soldiers feet. My partner is calling out targets left and right. The engineers below are yelling frantically as they attempt to repair one of the T-90's with drills.
 

 The American tank column has all but froze in their positions, the tank explodes brilliantly, killing the driver and the gunner. I look around, confused. There was no tank that shot that, what happened? I look up, and a contrail from an American hellfire missile leads directly to the destroyed T-90. I spot a small drone, using a laser to designate targets, and the bullet falls just below the small remote controlled helicopter. I adjust my aim



 Our line is holding strong, and lying in a small pool of blood, he lay dead. An uncontrollable anger possesses me, and I raise my gun, attempting to find this murderer. I see him, crouched inside a bus, taking potshots at the line. I use my rangefinder to gauge the distance. 1209 meters. I raise my rifle, and fire a shot. The bullet seems to hang in he air as it hurtles toward the American sniper. At second and a half passes between my shot and it reaching the sniper. The bullet hits the side of the bus he is hiding in, yelling as I do it. The bullet hangs in the air as it did before



 I sit down. There are explosions, and sit back up. I see a small buggy In the distance hurtling toward out line. I scope in. The buggy has at least four bricks of C-4 on the hood. I take aim, and shoot. Miss. I call it out over the radio, and the line adjusts it's fire on the buggy. A cannon shot from a T-90 hits near the tire of the buggy, and it goes up like a goddamn firework. The line stops for a moment, to watch the burning husk of the car flip through the air. It lands, and creates a crater the size of a refrigerator. The American line begins retreating. The soldiers bellow and scream at the tanks and fire off the last of their mags.

It was a weekend and myself and 4 friends had assembled for a LAN party. We had agreed to check out LOTR online

All of us wound up being Dwarves or Hobbits, both some form of melee dps/tank, and two hobbits doing I-don't-know-what.

Now, feather adorned purple pimp hat, and goddamn was it glorious. I swore to wear it from thereon in, stating something along the lines of 'I could kill a fucking Balrog with this thing on!'. And so the seed was planted. We began to wonder if there was even a Balrog in the game, checking on the map we found Moria, after much laughing and discussion our quest was determined. To slay the Balrog, 5 new players under level 20 setting out to kill a monster that was not only undoubtedly highly powered

The first challenge was to get everyone in the same place so our party could begin our epic quest. We decided to meet at the prancing pony

Now, all alone and all completely clueless about what lay ahead. After approximately 30 minutes of running we began to come closer together, three had arrived but myself and another were still a ways away. And then, within about 5 seconds of each other, the fellow traveller and I both got aggro from enemies well above our level range. I was quickly despatched with my friend not far behind. 

Much groaning was done

It was at this point we discovered the fast travel horses. You can pay a small fee and they will take you to key places fast, the two of us were on our way.

During this time the other three had been terrorising the patrons of the prancing pony, decided to have their characters mimic various sexual acts. This was probably a bad move, molesting the man who slew the Balrog, and was pointed to as one of the many, many (many) reasons this quest ended as it did.

Upon my arrival all the others were there

After several more minutes of dancing (I joined in of course, designated a party leader to follow, and then began running straight for it.

After approximately 45 seconds we had lost two people to a wall between them and the person they were following

After despatching the enemies, we set off again. Things went well for a while, we came across several groups of enemies that we took care of fairly easily, some of us even leveled. We came across a town and we all decided to set it as our home so we would spawn there on death. 

After five minutes or so of leaving the town we were strung out slightly and going through an area with enemies a few levels out of our highest players range

I was in the lead at the time, you're healer', sound advice as the tanks should be in the lead incase of an unexpected enemy lurking around.

As he said that I spotted a lone enemy not far off the track, running, requesting healing and all round chaos was unleashed. I attempted to heal my teammates but they were cut down so quickly I could do nothing but flee. After a short bloody fight, I was the only survivor, having fled most of the way back to the village the others were spawning at.

After a lot of laughing, with my character being set to follow the backmost player and then having my keyboard and mouse taken away. 

After some time we came to a river with huge cliffs either side. After looking at the map we found it was pretty much impassible save for a few select points, and our battle with the Balrog. We decided to swim along it, despite it being longer than on foot, since it was a clear path and was likely free of any enemies we would surely encounter on land.

So we set off

After some time, still on auto-swim and faced him back the way we came, then we all went back to our seats and played it cool.

He returned and found nothing amiss, he checked his map, and then the cursing started and the laughing too.

When he eventually caught back up

After some time we came to our exit

We had come too far to stop now. We crept forward, then the cry went out ' FOR ROHAN!' We made a run for it. 

Our heroic charge went well for the first 30 metres or so. Then one friend got one-shotted

Another friend went down, hoping we could get far enough to drop the enemies hot on our heels. Then as we rounded a corner we found ourselves heading straight for a pack of enemies. The strongest member of the party, who was at the front of the charge, said 'I'll grab aggro, friend A, keep him secret, keep him safe

Myself and Friend A were determined to make sure his sacrifice was not in vain. We headed on, we ran to the left, we had spotted a river and hoped that the enemies couldn't follow us in, being large ogre type creatures. 

We made it to the water, the last of his health being swiped away by one of the ogres who had been stalking us. I ran, I knew I wouldn't make it but I couldn't just give up. Using every healing buff I could and running straight forward I made it another hundred metres before I fell. The hat had made it as far as it would, that day. 

We had failed to reach Moria, and had many a laugh along the way. The second fellowship would return...",Video Game,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,,

 It was getting dark so we headed for a cave. Not much caves on this crap continet. I believe it's called  ""Indar"" or some shit I didn't pay attention to when I signed up. I set up a small campfire with my EST otherwise known as ""Emergency Survival Kit."" These fellas I'm with don't know who I am, because friends always die. 

All 5 of us were sitting around the campfire, what do you all think of these 'glorious' rations? taste worst than an NC snatch! haha.""

I loathe hierarchies, never giving them. I guess this is apart of growing up. Speaking of growing up, I remember when I enlisted. See in our sovereignty, we don't enlist weaklings. Our proud collective only wants the best. They do their best to convince you not to join up, it's a tactic they use to weed out the ones who just want to look good in a uniform. They run so many test too, but lets not talk about those. I remember walking into the recruitment stations. My enlistment papers in one hand, and all the things I own in...well I was wearing them actually. My parents were always neutral when it came to politics, they gave me the boot. I walked up to the Fleet sergeant and handed him my papers. ""Are you sure boy

I regret that day, yet treat us like dirt. For a race, that prides itself on technology and prosperity, we can't even win a war. I remember hearing stories of how the colonist started the vanu sovereignty, but I can't remember.

L.A. Noire was my playground for many weeks after it launched. The game was a positive step in the right direction for the video game medium. Good story. Superb graphical performance. Most of all, there was a justified reason for your actions. 

Those justified reasons soon became things of the past as I found faster and more sporty cars and vehicles. 

Many hours into the game, but nothing 'borrowing' a new car could not fix. Then, one day, I met my fear head-on. 

The trams were always odd to me. I had hit them many times throughout my play-through. I must have never gathered enough velocity to shake the steel beasts for they usually brought me from sixty to zero with little more than a budge. So over time, I grew to ignore the tracks that the trams followed. This was my undoing. 

I must have been more reckless than I otherwise had been when it happened. I was speeding through Hollywood, big and yellow and traveling at a speed that would soon allow the two of us to intersect. I panicked. Really. In reality, away from the polygons and the digital enjoyment, I gasped. I might have quietly shouted. There was no turning back now for all four tires were meeting no friction as they turned in the air.       

My car met the tram at full speed. The tram, however, as the tram lifted off the tracks, skidding and screeching towards cars awaiting the red lights. It met them with a good speed, causing surprising amounts of damage. By this point, my controller was on the floor. I was laughing. Not one of those slight giggles. My sides were burning. I could not breath. The car in the game was totaled on the opposite side of the street in pieces.

Like most people in HL2RP; I wound up as Tyler Jones, thankfully, the resistance was strong and managed to fend these off for a long time.

He began his life off the train in City 45, a small group of puppets controlled by the combine. Tyler eventually was sick of the beatings, murders, amputations and cruelty of the life in the City, and so Tyler Jones ended up one day taking a trip through the disgusting sewers, emerging in District 6.

Now then, a sweep would happen, sometimes twice a day, depending on how they felt or how much trouble the rebels were causing, most citizens got captured and executed (Permakilled and then had to make a new character) because they had a unloaded 9mm or something. Anyhow, he joined up as a refugee for the City 45 Lambda Movement, helping them out and sitting as a door guard for about 2 weeks with his 9mm, he managed to swipe a shotgun off a Combine Officer's corpse with some ammo bought from a local gun dealer. He made about 5000 tokens working for Lambda with multiple missions.

Before he joined up with Lambda as a official resistance member, Skylar McFarly, Lilly Maylin, Phoenix Black, John Ontaro and David Jackson, they fought the combine during sweeps. But during another D6 sweep, Tyler was captured by the elite Overwatch Transhuman Arm and 2 Combine Units, the prison cells and the amputation room which is execution.)
Being a supposed rebel armed with a shotgun and wearing Heavy Kevlar, the JUDGE went away for a second. Tyler slipped his ties off, and took his shotgun and pulse rifle from the crate, the JUDGE unit came back, his brains then splattered the floor. Tyler had a few undercovers working as 'Combine', and broke him out of the nexus, being one of the few on the server to do so, having to break through the Combine's Headquarters.

After that, using the secret sewer entrance to defect. He had a quick reunion with the Traceless Shadow team, and fought off more waves of combine forces, then taking a combine hostage and forcing him to work for them. The combine was hunted down, tracked to our secret Boiler Room, and 3 unmarked GHOST units pinned us down, killing everyone who was helping but our small group, designed to take on SEVERAL resistance members alone

Now, the shade was a tough man, the only resistance to be armed with a Crossbow and had a killcount of over 200 combine, being impressive for a SINGLE character. The Shade was also an assassin. Tyler Jones left Traceless Shadow, the group shattered, and Tyler was stabbed by his former associate, Skylar in the back, the Lambda Leader

As a Lambda, the head tech of the Lambda Movement, the wife of Jedediah North. He also had captured a target of Xavier Flanders, Luke McCarthy, but out of forgiveness, Xavier spared him and handed Tyler 3000 tokens. But Tyler's story ended as he took several weapons from The Rising Sun Remnant Cache, a contract was put on his head for a mere 300 tokens, hunting him down and then ending his eventful life with a single M24 bullet.

1364501466.0,1b7431,A longish post I wrote about my early experiences with *Crusader Kings II* - The House of Ua Cheinnselaig,turnerjer,11,1,1,"The House of Ua Cheinnselaig is thriving once again.


After Great Grandfather Donchad 'The Young' passed away, meant that my Middle Eastern holdings were in a near-constant state of rebellion. On top of this, I had invested a number of Irish Lords with Duchies in Jerusalem, and unwisely had given them the surrounding Counties as well. This meant that, despite my near-draconian level of Crown Authority, they were capable of raising serious armies at a moment's notice, and splashing them time and again against the walls of Jericho. (The cities and castles of the region are very heavily fortified (at least compared to young Ireland), but they could keep me constantly distracted


They couldn't, instead of Irish armies of one or two thousand, I had 25,000 infidels marching on Baalbek.


Then, Wales, and Jerusalem finally passed away at age 72. 'The Young' indeed!


Donchad already had a grandson


The fact that Gabran was known as 'The Kind' shows that, Craven, Slothful, Wrothful, Cruel, and Paranoid, yes... but not Kind.


To paraphrase Frank Herbert


The implosion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem picked up speed. The few Middle Eastern Lords with whom I didn't have Truces rebelled at once. And just to add some more meat to the stew


In a way, and install loyaler subjects in their place. But when half of Erin rebels simultaneously, where do you raise the armies to fight against them?


(In a word: Wales. I'm not sure why


My basic mistake


The Sultan of Syria had Baalbek under siege. I was too busy stamping out insurrections in my own back yard to do anything about it. The Templars and Hospitallers refused to help out


The situation was deteriorating. Panic was rising. Then... disaster!


Gabran the Kind took an arrow to the knee in a back-yard scuffle with some uppity Earl! He was rendered Incapable, etc.) Without a tenable Stewardship score, I was unable to manage my extensive Demesne holdings, leading to greater dissatisfaction among my vassals, and even more chance of rebellions! It was starting to feel like a good old Dwarf Fortress Despair Spiral.


Then... the death blow.


My great-great-uncle (or whatever) Murchad of Baalbek got me Excommunicated.

So I grabbed it

Made myself a Elvaan Warrior

I went up to it and it offered me a quest to go and kill ""something"" So I accepted. I ran off to look for this enemy. I happened upon a giant tree. and attempted to kill it. I was quickly wiped out.  

I laughed about it in region chat. and everyone asked me where I was killed.   

It turns out a lot of people were looking fot this tree. I gave them the grid locationa I was at when I died. And 100's of people ran that way.   

I figured this would be a good chance for me to join them and kill the tree also.  

Not so much. It released an AOE and killed me in 1 shot. I ran over there again thinking it was just a lucky shot.. and the moment I got there I was killed again.  

Ok no biggy. I am not ready for this. I will go and kill more rabbits.  

Zone chat is exploding at this point with everyone fighting the tree. Suddenly Everyone in zone chat starts saying the same thing.  

""Where did he go?""  
""Where is the tree?""  
""Does anyone see the tree?""  

Suddenly I hear a  *Teleportation sound* next to me. I turn to look and there stands the giant tree. way across the zone near the level 2 rabbits.  

He promptly kills me.  

I respawn and notice in chat they have found him again

We were in the Congo going for a last attempt at finding Sam's lost mentor Brigadier General Robert Gray and his two right hand men. Along for the ride was Robert Gray's grandson Brandon (Sam's love interest). He had uncovered new clues and insisted on coming along for this trip. 

Earlier in the session we had, Albert Malthus, to Gorilla Khan's secret jungle hide out.

Right around this time several spear wielding Avens ambushed us. My three friends were busy with a pair of Avens, couldn't break the Aven's grip as it started to fly up into the jungle canopy.

While I raged at the kidnapping of Sam's Not-Boyfriend my fellow players pointed out this was the last fight of the night and I hadn't used my fate points yet.

I then threw every following fate point I could justify into my next roll. Which was admittedly a pretty decent roll. The DM amused at my detailed plan of climbing the trees and tackling the bird trying to make off with Brandon let me get away with a couple shaky reasons for why I can do X. And probably because he wanted this session to end on an epic high note. 

He declared I had *Super Succeeded* my Athletics roll to accomplish my plan and this is what happened.

Sam bolted up the vine covered trees like a monkey all while being chased by Aven 1. She roared ""LET HIM GO!!"" with a flying leap from the treetop and managed to tackle Aven 3 flying off with Brandon mid-air. Her tackle knocked Brandon loose while she and Aven 3 crashed into Aven 1. Aven 1's spear fatally stabbed Aven 3

Standing up Sam snarled pointing at the trio of dead birdman ""And don't you *ever* fucking touch Brandon again!""

As for poor Brandon? He was stuck tangled up in some vines but fine. He solemnly swore to never accompany Sam on her adventures again. We got him and Edgar bustled off to our pseudo base camp at an archaeological dig before digging deeper into the jungle to find Khan and Albert Malthus.",self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dwray/spirit_of_the_century_major_sam_gears_and_the/

I have decided to go back to the wilderness.  I need rest.  Rest that will not involve murder of a friend

But

We had the mercenary caught

We arrived at the house

Indriss went on to explain that this ‘nervous man’ was the advisor to the king of Salthirn.  And we had blown his cover, only with a second blade on the back, with metal linking the two.  The mercenary also had three glass orbs: Two black, and one blue.  These looked like the orbs the mercenary had used to set the inn on fire.  

The mercenary, an ancient people who had cracked, white skin that bled poison and were constantly in pain.  Torinn threatened the Yvan’Shul, and drew his knife.  He was promptly arrested.  The Yvan’Shul refused to say anything about himself when I interrogated him with the steward.  We got into arguments, and I was getting very angry.

Then something cracked in my head.  Something… I don’t know, I thought he was the nicest man I've ever seen.  I decided to leave, content that he was perfectly innocent.  I heard him then, seizing the chance, kick the table we were using to interrogate him into the steward.  

I also inspected the straight sword to see if it had any magical effects.  Somebody must’ve slipped something into my drink that morning, yelling something about the goddess Zythra.  I showed him the sword, and cut a deep gash across his chest that did not heal.

We were arrested due to drawing weapons.  We were in the jail for the rest of the day, where we, well slept.
	
Except for Zaharia.  He wasn’t arrested because he was apparently chasing the advisor, but for some reason Torinn wasn’t.  

Zaharia managed to find his way back early in the morning.  For some reason Torinn had found a flower, and made the innkeeper eat it.  I decided to leave the inn to wander for a while, browsing through the wares… got in a street fight with some bandit… and I came back at the same time as Easy Torinn.  

There were guards all over the place, but Zaharia couldn't be the culprit… and the Dwarf Zaharia murdered…

…Was Branimir. 

Something wasn’t right with Easy Torinn.  He didn’t seem as broken as I was about Branimir’s death, and he decided to tag along.  

We couldn’t get the journal until the body was complete for last rites.  I managed to get it at the guard barracks

As I was looking through Branimir’s things (it would be a waste to leave the trail rations behind) I noticed a note.  What it said will haunt me for the rest of my life:

“Where’s your Queen now?” –E.T.

I knew it.  I always did.  Torinn somehow managed to kill Branimir

One thing is clear

And how I’m going to end him.

Put quite simply we want you and your group to go and turn yourselves in or I will turn you over to my comrade. Death has made him quite frustrated and I am sure he would *love* to relieve some of his tension."" You don't buy it, in fact this ruse is just making you angry. You call to the voice to show himself and in response the window behind your desk explodes. Then the voice chimes in again "" Well to late seems one of your men is dead and he died rather horribly."" You fling the door open and go running outside to check on your men. Sure enough one of the guardsmen near your office is missing. A commotion arises at the door to your office which has shut and locked of its own accord. You join your men in trying to bust down your own door. As you are doing this some of your other men find the missing guardsmen dead with a perfect empty circle where his ears used to be. You gear up to rush your door. It unlocks and opens like nothing is wrong. You enter the room cautiously and find the four men who came to you earlier all dead with a gaping hole where there right eyes used to be. The voice comes again "" I warned you, now if you value your lives go and turn yourselves in."" All but your three most loyal men flee and you can tell that these three are scared. But you do not fear these ""ghosts"" and you set about berating them and telling them to show themselves. The rest of the windows explode and the door closes and locks yet again. A man clothed in white and pale as fresh snow steps off your windowsill and into the room. As he steps down he watch as he transforms into a creature of shadows and nightmare. He gestures towards the door and your last men run leaving you to stand alone against the shade. You swing your blade at him and feel it connect. You feel a warmth growing around your stomach and look down. There sticking out of you is the blade of a broadsword. You turn your head to see a pair of glowing red eyes and a wicked white grin. You here a perky voice to your right say ""Hi there"". Then it happens. You feel the blow to your knees first as you pitch forward the young elf girl on your left, you feel like you should recognize her but can't tell from where, stabs her blade into your neck. Then the blade in your stomach retracts only to swiftly return and finally the shade in front you steps in and stabs you through the chin. As the last of you life drains away you hear the voice of the gnome who hit you in the knees say ""Don't worry you're his now"" and you feel a little bite on your ear.

We ripped through all the lesser punks in the station and we went deeper

Disconcerted

We screamed like schoolgirls and scrambled in a blur of terror. Ran up the stairs without looking back

The endless stairs seemed virtually infinite. Punk bastard stepping on our heels. We ran for our lives

Panting

Gah

It started after we got our share of gold from the pirate ship, apparently.  A shame, too.  It looked like a good seaworthy vessel. 

We went through the day, to await their interrogation and prompt execution at the port of Dravocus.  They glared at us the whole time.  Zaharia was severely injured during the fight with the pirates, so he was downstairs having his wounds tended to.

The last few days have passed uneventfully, had he not died.  He was loved by all, with a wife and children at home, even though his second home was the ocean.

We heard a scream, and I reached down to pick it up.

How could I have been so foolish?  The poison started eating away at my arm

I had a dream while I was unconscious, with white braziers full of fire.  I noticed behind me Zaharia, Branimir, and Easy Torinn.  They were ethereal, like ghosts, and followed exactly a few steps behind me as I walked over…

There was a… bowl in the middle.  I went over to it, and future and the strange voice from before returned, once again telling me I was going to need strength…

And then I awoke, Lilmora had said.  The initial shock of losing my arm, my left arm, was gone.  I’m probably never going to get it back…

A thin Dwarf walked up, called Hipporaemus.  
	
So here I am now, and should be in his presence in a couple of days.

This Kilnriv that I’ve been recently wielding has been incredibly useful, as I’ve observed in Lilmora.

Backstory.. Another Player in a set of events previously, to raise an undead army and attack the human cities, along the way, they captured and enslaved small villages of humans, dark elves and elves alike.. the dark-elves survived the horrors longest.

So

Terroz was now placed (at the start of the campaign) as head of Clan-Poison Moon's slaves, and steal some of his masters items and begin his adventure.

But No.. As soon as the dagger pierced the masters heart, claimed rightful inheritance of the masters position. (ooh Kay, so how do I now bring in the rest of the party???)

So, demand proof that this upstart was capable of being a master.. 

Using a dagger(from the now dead master) of a demon soul, to become the new master of clan -poison moon.

trapped into the rules of their own making, began.

And what a reign it was.. for the next few years, bruised, poisoned, multi-poisoned, or just lifeless for unexplainable reasons. As Terroz tried (and failed) multiple times, to create poisons, worthy of clan poison. 

Lucius, attempted to do other strange things. 

From attempting to summon golems, camps, food stores and other things) Finally, Lucius left the camps and went to find some place to be safer.. but in order to find his way back, he decided to leave some kind of path... a cobblestone path.. in hilly regions... for 35km...

Playing old school Vampire: The Masquerade in the global Camarilla Club a few years ago, but follow just enough to not get killed.  I was part of a nomadic motorcycle club, and had arms dealing to my name.  Living in NYC at the time, this was my travelling character.

Anyway

He didn't ask for references.  He just wanted guns.

So I gave them to 'em.  I had been sure to make gunsmithing an ability on my end

They didn't.

I sent the detonators to my Brother in Texas and the ST thanked me for the juicy plotline.

And they never figured it out.

...

#2

I show up to game in army fatigues, and let people make assumptions about my character.  Immediately they had me pegged as Brujah (the rebellious warrior scholars).  When asked about my family, I told them to be more cautious of the Masquerade, and said that I was a ""Warrior"" (Brujah Nicknames are Warrior Scholar).  They directed me to the Brujah Primogen (local leadership).

...who'd just been placed as Prince unbeknownst to me and everyone there.  So there was a debate (Brujah are more idealistic).  I won.  I was Brujah Primogen (to be fair, I could say ""I'm the Brujah Primogen and not found to be lying thorugh lie detection powers.  

I played the shit out of this character.  He remained Primogen for a number of months.  I had conflicts with the Tremere primogen (Tremere and Assamites don't get along), but played it off as if I was just ""thirsty"".

And I did this all through social engineering and skill.  No combat powers used

...
3.

I played in an unaffilliated LARP in NYC, according to their own clan book.  At the turn of the 20th century I'd imagine worse.  I was told I was the head of the local coven, and I had an assistant - a woman.

After clearing it with the other players, sure, but they wouldn't have taken just any blood, would they (in character at least). I also began talking to them about ""Native American mysticism"" which was pure racism on my character's part, and the Tremere tend to look for new sources of magic.  I spent nearly all my time talking with / interrogating them.

Back to my assistant.  Every time she came to me, she had to prove herself.

Turned out both the Gangrel and the assistant were Sabbat infiltrators.  She'd been tasked to get me alone and assassinate me.  She couldn't

The Gangrel?  Well they *were* Sabbat scouts.  I *was* right about their heritage.  I was the *only one* suspecting them.  

The STs stepped in and had a deus ex machina for the second night.  It sucked because it happened as soon as I started playing that night

I should mention that if you know my previous submissions I am the opposite of sexist and racist.  I made sure to confer with the players and explain what i was doing was in character, and I got this story out of it.",Table,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,,

We decided to recollect ourselves at an inn in Sagon.  The guards watched over Zaharia and Lilmora.  The most logical path to take was to travel back to Dodaca.  The guards and soldiers were very angry at Lilmora, we had settled everything: Lilmora was to be executed for her crimes, even though she told use everything about the mercenary leader, Drake, and the large man who had led the attack, Yuleth.  Zaharia, on the other hand, so he wouldn't be charged.  We’re still keeping an eye on him

We started the trek back to Dodaca, but I could smell the danger, and all of us drew our weapons.  I tried to flank the bandits during the battle.  However, they had traps set in the grass, and I fell down a pit.  

Luckily no one noticed, though my bones I remember were still a bit sore. 

The bandits were ferocious, so we fought harder than they did.  One by one, the bandits fell.  The last one started fleeing, but we realized he would return for revenge.  So I rushed over, roaring in victory.  I had already killed one of the running bandit’s companions, and I was in a triumphant rage.  

The bandit didn't stand a chance.  The others had surrounded him

It was then I noticed that a few guards and Lilmora were in more pit traps, and she gave a dagger back to one of the guards. 

We made it to Dodaca, Zaharia, and I went to the palace for a war council.  Zaharia was left outside, as he wasn't feeling good.  Something happened to him in the mines Lilmora told me about, as the Deva believes himself to be a Dragonborn, just like Torinn.

The news of Haldren Indriss’s death took a big toll.  Indriss supplied most of the money and soldiers to the Salthirn military, Zaharia, and I would accompany the spymaster to Dravocus.  I realized that Lilmora would end up being an asset, as she is a noble, and her diplomacy skills are unrivaled.  

There is something about her, even if she joined with Drake.  She is a good fighter as well, as I saw during the fight in Sagon.  So I asked to free her from prison, getting permission to do so.

During the way out, however, did not recognize her.  This will require some thought…

Four days I’ve been alone.  Four days with these voices in my head, and Zaharia, taunting me, distracting me from my hunting.  I nearly died the other day, fighting a crocodile.  I had to recover my wounds from that fight.  I managed to kill a deer though, cooking it up as food that could last me for quite a while.  

I was at my small camp in the night when I heard the sound of axes hitting wood.  I decided to investigate

It was a variety of soldiers from the Salthirn military, and many more.  An odd bunch, even more so when I saw they had the dead look in their eyes, just like Berix when he was enthralled. 

I immediately got my camp packed up, and started on my way to Mayce, and then perhaps later back to Dodaca to track down Berix.  It took me a few days to get there, and the sight of Mayce was horrifying.

The small city was burning.  Soldiers were inside, and houses falling to the ground.  I had to get in, which wasn’t hard.  

The only house that was relatively undamaged was larger than the rest, though the Goblin looked rather disheveled.  He let me in, and explained the situation.

A variety of soldiers from the military had come, who turned out to be enthralled, cut down half of Marx’s force and started destroying the city.  Vines had erupted, signaling Zythra’s return.   The remaining civilians were starting to evacuate, so we had to hold off any enthralled soldiers until all the civilians were out.

So we went out the back way

An onslaught it was, but a few of us, including me, managed to get free.  The vine horror stayed around for quite a while, before being put down by the guards. 

During the battle, more enthralled surrounded me.   I was already fairly injured during the battle, but it was now a four vs. one fight, and not in my favor.  I had no time to think, and I was on the ground, unconscious.  

While unconscious, returned.  Mocking me about my deeds in the past.  But then my mother appeared, pointing at the desk.  I looked, and understood.  I couldn’t die now.  Melora had other plans right now.

My eyes snapped open, to no avail.  The enthralled heard me, and attacked me.  However, my stamina was sufficient enough, and I smashed the crystal with the butt of my spear, shattering it into millions of pieces. 

Like last time, yelling to Marx about what had happened, when we heard the sound of hundreds of soldiers running at us, so we fled, quickly joining the citizens.

I’ve told Marx what’s happened since we left for Dodaca, and Berix.  We’re on the road now.  It will take nearly a week to get there.

Hopefully we will get there without much trouble.

We entered into the Silk Whispers Inn.  The silver haired man was gone, a man with a brown mustache, and the other was obviously a noble who had two intimidating bodyguards with him.

We walked him, who left.  As they were walking out, Easy Torinn insulted him behind his back, putting his ball in a fist with the thumb enclosed by the fingers, an apparent sign of disrespect.  One of the bodyguards, however, noticed, engaging Easy Torinn in a fist fight.  Even though Torinn had tough scales and claws, was looking at the fight with a smirk on his face.  

We asked the barkeeper who the noble was, running over.  We tried to get in, but we didn’t have an appointment.  However, when we told the guard about Narith Indriss, he let us through, albeit with our weapons outside the home.  We objected, saying we would need to defend ourselves in case we were attacked.  The guard laughed, though.  

The guard was right.  It was as though Indriss had his own personal pack, Easy Torinn felt vulnerable, so he asked Zaharia to use his illusions to disguise him. 

The end result was not favorable.  Torinn’s scales were colored with flowers
	
Branimir did not go out silently, Branimir had studied the ring so much that it had addled his Dwarven brains.  He thought that if the ring was produced, it would summon a devil to the mortal realm.  He nevertheless went to join Easy Torinn (who was still yelling rude comments.)

Haldren Indriss was obviously distressed with the news of his son’s kidnapping.  He told us to go see his steward.  While we conferred

It was obvious the steward was hiding something

It was approaching nightfall

I have not been writing everything of this adventure.  Since we’ve gotten to Dodaca, and it came to a head in the temple.  As Branimir was searching the body, he noticed the money we had given the boy was gone.

This is why Easy Torinn mentioned about being the boy’s adopted father.  He had lied to the guard to get back the money we had given him.  What Torinn said next did not help matters.

“Oh

A silence followed the Dragonborn’s statement.  Torinn simply stared at me, content to watch the fight.  I, however, grabbed Branimir.  This was not going to be an all-out brawl.  I didn’t want to see my newfound friends kill each other.

Easy Torinn threatened Zaharia, and Easy Torinn realized he was outnumbered, going onto his knees, saying half-condescendingly “I’m sorry.” 
	
Branimir ran over

“You’re not forgiven.”

There was an attack on the Unflinching today.  Pirates, and watched as Varis and Zaharia gloomily got up; putting on their armor, Varis drawing his rapier, making sure the point was sharp enough to rip through flesh.  

There was a pirate ship, hacking at them with our blades, when the pirate ship suddenly started getting closer, crashing against ours, knocking both of us to our knees. 

I was starting to get up onto my knees when through the wood a massive ballista shot hit me right in my arm, wrestling a pirate.  The Elf was obviously losing, and the pirate was cackling “You are weak.” 

I got up, looking at him in the eye.  Something felt… right about what I said next:

“Pick a god and pray.”

Then I broke the pirate’s back on the side of the ship

The fight continued, however, is one raised their hand, teleporting onboard our ship, unleashing vines all around the ship where there were not any before.  They grabbed us, and still another caster shot out green mist that contained poison.  It hit the spymaster and Lilmora, as well as Zaharia. 

I managed to break free of the bonds, which I did the same.  There were a few more casters there, and it was obvious at this point that they worked for Zythra.  Two of them had been mobbed once they jumped onto the Unflinching and were fighting off sailors with wooden daggers.  Sharp things, killed a sailor in one stroke.

There were two others on board of the pirate ship, me, the master of arms, and Beriix.  Oh yes.  He actually ended up joining us on the voyage.  A few other sailors had joined us, and we were fighting, downing a Zythra caster.  

The other one on board screamed in rage.  One of the two who had teleported onto our ship had already fallen

Throughout the battle, I could tell her emotions were waning, and there were already so many injured sailors.  She looked at me, and then realized what to do. 

The air bent around me, and raised her falchion.

Something that Lilmora has told me: The more she uses her emotions

“Hey caster.  Fute you!” 

Her falchion cut a massive slash across the caster’s chest, was fairly easy.  The pirates had already been intimidated as their comrades fell.  A few even ended up throwing themselves overboard, drowning.  

We’re working on picking up the bodies now.  We lost a good number on our side.  On particular loss was a sailor named ‘Hamilton, lowering his body into the ocean.  

The remaining pirates, surrendered.  They’re tied up now, as I write.

One thing I noted: The pirates are not enthralled like the soldiers back in Mayce.  I don’t know why

And I’m hoping I find Easy Torinn soon.

Three days have passed since Easy Torinn and Branimir fought in the Temple of the Raven Queen here in Dodaca.  Torinn has not woken up since the blow Branimir dealt to him, decided to let Easy Torinn go after he woke up. 

Which was this morning, and we continued our investigation, after taking a brief rest at the Sleeping Lion Inn to get some food.  It looks like the innkeeper is finally starting to like Easy Torinn, as she said she’s into ‘tough guys.’  I don’t exactly know what that means, but it must be a compliment, as Torinn was considerably more cheerful as we ate.

Still

Remembering the steward’s words, but we convinced him to let us in free.  Haldren Indriss’s blessings helped persuade him.  

The first two rooms were locked, but Branimir could tell he was hiding something.  It also did not help that Easy Torinn was holding the man’s hand as we questioned him.  It was then I noticed a cloth sticking out of the man’s large drawer.  I opened it up, and out came a man dressed in the same clothing the mercenaries in Mayce had worn.  The only difference was that his entire head was wrapping up in a cloth.  

A minor skirmish erupted in the room, but he had to leave.  With that, he took out a mysterious black ball, and threw it at my face.  It exploded into smoke, blinding me as I wiped it from my eyes.  
	
When they were cleared, and the mercenary took out a red ball, smashing it on the ground.  The wooden planks burst into flame as my Dwarven friend and I fought the mercenary.  He knocked Branimir out, and I was fighting him alone.  He was wily, using many tactics to get away, including throwing me into a wall.  Still, I was doing well when he pulled out a blade, dazing me.  I feared the worst.

For those who don't know EQ

After he finished giving me all the gear, this thing takes away more hp than I even have at this level. I wonder what would happen if...""

I put it on without thinking. Before transferring our gear, I succumbed to my own idiotic curiosity. I died instantly. And then I appeared at my bind point (soulbinder in GFay) and died instantly again. And then it loaded and I died instantly again. It wasn't stopping. In EQ, when you die, you leave a corpse with your gear (or an empty corpse if you have no more gear to drop), and if you don't recover your corpse, it disappears along with your equipment after some time. However, my fresh character was below level 10, characters under 10 get to respawn with their gear. So now I was now in an infinite death loop.

I start freaking out. I couldn't contact my friend right away because I couldn't use the chat. I couldn't access the money, and I was spazzing out too hard to figure out an alternate way to contact my friend. All I could do sit there while my High Elf corpse factory ran on auto pilot. Luckily my friend wasn't a moron like me, and my phone rang.

""Dude... I fucked up.""

I explained the situation. Thankfully he's a cool guy and he was more fascinated with the situation than pissed off that I may have bankrupted his account. He tells me to force close and restart the program

My buddy says it's time to bring in the almighty GMs.

We get a GM over surprisingly fast. I explain to him what I did. He is silent for a while. He tells me to try logging in again. I do. Corpse factory back on. I call friend. He says to log off again. Get back on other character. Talk to GM.

""So... I have never seen anything like this before. I'm at a total loss. I have no idea how to stop this. We will be in touch.""

I logged in again three days later to find the death loop still active. At some time in the next few days, while having some nostalgia about EQ, I was stricken by my uncontrollable curiosity once more. I paid for a month subscription and logged in. I don't know when or how, but someone had separated my incredibly suicidal elf from her iron maiden. *evil grin* I attempt to reequip the armor. Doesn't work. Level requirements have been added to gear.

That was the moment I knew that EQ was really over forever

We start out doing pretty well, and our reinforcement count drops like crazy. We push back, but our efforts were in vain, and it looked like at the rate things were going we would soon lose. My cousin and I, knowing the end was near, retreat to the edge of the map towards where the LAAT ship was. Somehow we are lucky enough to be the last two left when the reinforcement count is at 2, so no more AI will spawn and die to bring it down and make us lose. The enemy had about 25-30 reinforcements left at this point

So I notice the gunship nearby, maybe we can use this ship, 'casue there's no way we can capture the command posts with just the two of us, and we won't be able to fight off the last 30 of them on foot."" So he gets in the ship and pilots while I get on the guns. We fly over to the center of the map and the droids started trying to snipe us, so I yelled to him, ""Go up!!"" 

He took that very seriously and went to the height cap of the map. They weren't accurate enough to hit us at this distance, we circled the map several times. Impatient young me was getting frustrated, but I eventually got a leg shot and blew the droid to pieces. I got the next droid a little bit faster, and eventually I was only taking one shot to hit each one. When we got down to the last two, our last command post started flashing. There was no way we would have time to exit the ship, and I couldn't take one shot to hit each of them at the distance I was at, not even with my improved speed. My cousin and I give each other a knowing look, and right before we collide with a cliff I fire at them and kill both with one shot.  Oh that Victory was sweet.

This mod was awesome, instant kill, send lamers into alternate dimensions, so much opportunity to play God and abuse people.  That wasn't me.

No, a feature not meant to be!  It was as though the developers allowed people to ride space ships and such but never perfected the process so it was never used, the models were there, the functionality, was there, but it simply just wasn't in the game.

Well I loaded a Lambda shuttle.  Amazingly I could get in

Well I told everyone there was a special trip we were going on

After that I led them all to a large clearing at the end of the level. 

Now my idea as admin is

Well waiting for them was a row of tauntauns that they could ride (typically not available in multiplayer).  There was one problem though.

An army of dark jedi.  Dozens, they functioned normally in multiplayer!  They would only react once you got close to them.    (I had previously spawned them earlier, and using admin powers I cloaked myself so they wouldn't see me)

So as everyone mounted their tauntauns I gave a long Lord Of The Rings style speech telling everyone they were my brothers and all that crap.  I then instructed everyone to draw their weapons.  Everyone drew their lightsabers.  

I then screamed (typed)  TO ARMS!!!  Then we started charging the army of dark jedi!  

Once we were a few hundred feet away all the dark jedi drew their lightsabers

It was amazing

""I must be more careful!"" He mutters to himself

It had been a long time since Cix could remember when the voices didn't exist. The Soldier, except his first voice. The one that saved his life during the invasions. When they came in their flying citadels and summoned for Cix-es that could have been, ones from other realities they had taken over. The Savage helped him defeat them all, but he was taken when his world fell, like they all will eventually. But not this one. Not if he could help it. After what seemed like an eternity of torture and isolation he was brought forth and instructed to kill his counterpart on this world, which he did, in exchange for his freedom. 

Waking from his daze, talking up the locals. All according to plan. A silent nod is exchanged between them and Cix spins abruptly and walks back to the room it had taken a small fortune in bribes to acquire. Soon after, the smashing of wine glasses, the crashing of tables and the smell of smoke begins emanating from downstairs and the guards rush down to see what is going on. Cix peeks into the hallway, one left. He saunters down the hallway. The guard, alert already; tells him to get lost. With a quick blow to the head the protests end. Opening the door very slowly, Cix enters the high prince's chambers. 

**Later that night.**

What if he told those who control him that Cix was actively working against them? And there is only one way to ensure that without bloodshed....

The first words Cix speaks when he wakes are: ""We can't let him go."" After explanations  are given

Walking calmly back into the inn, all looking a little worse for wear after last night's bar fight. In one deft motion, he throws all his alchemical tools to the floor, lighting a roaring blaze and filling the hallway with a thick, cloying smoke. Cix slips past the guards, who in a panic are making their way to the prince's room. As the door opens, Cix rushes past them and with a powerful leap, with Gnomir locked in a bear-hug.

I had been mining for days. On me, and some stone pickaxes as well as a iron sword. Underneath my house was my mine, which was a huge underground workway of confusion. It went everywhere and it was hard to get back.

But I went on.

I had just found a new cave. I never saw it coming. A creeper was just around the corner

I never found that cave again.

I respawned. It was night, in a small grassland without any water or trees, so I had to move to survive. I kept on walking, jumping  over mounds of grass when I heard something following me. I did a quick-look behind and confirmed my fears: a creeper had discovered me.

It quickly attracted attention from other monsters. Soon, and 2 zombies. I soon came across a small legion of skeletons, around six of them, who were marching through the forest in a roman formation. I was amazed that they actually did that, and I've never seen it happen before. They looked at me briefly and decided to not give chase except two who broke formation and started shooting at me. I eventually came too my house, opened the door, and they left. The creepers decided that there were better things to do, they stayed. The spider hanged around

I was obviously scared, I went outside. I heard the famous 'Sssssss' and then an explosion.

We finally marched to Dodaca after days of tireless walking.  We lost a few stragglers on the road

Immediately Marx got an audience with the king, so he joined the war council with the king.

The advisor was there, however, is a sly man.  He questioned if I could be trusted.  I told him I could, as I fought rather hard during the battle in Mayce.  The advisor said that they should question whether or not I had stolen the book and copied his writing to frame him as a supporter of Zythra.

Ultimately, and we decided on having a sizable amount of Dodaca’s best soldiers meet Zythra in battle.  Varis and I would go to Sagon, a city near Dodaca, to go to a ‘ball’ some nobles were hosting.  We would solicit aid from the nobles, be it money, men, or food.  

So there Varis and I were, and although he was slightly angry at me for abandoning the investigation, he agreed to help the Salthirn military fight Zythra’s enthralled.  

A few hours past with idle talk and laughter, and boastings of past deeds.  

The doors suddenly were slammed, and Varis and I managed to get out after some persuasion to the honor guard.

I drew my spear

And look who was with the mercenaries but Zaharia.

The Deva hadn’t been executed, and he didn’t.  The apparent leader of the mercenaries looked at Zaharia with loathing at this, but continued fighting.

A few mercenaries ended up going through different rooms, having been bribed by the mercenaries.  Still, we did well in keeping the mercenaries distracted while the honor guard moved the nobles to a more easily defendable part of the mansion.  

This all changed when the leader of the mercenaries cut down the two guards next to me.  

Varis and I ended up retreating, a huge bear of a man, offered us surrender, which we took.   I did not want to die that day.

The mercenaries took our weapons

The leader walked up to Haldren Indriss, which the leader gave.  The mercenary stabbed Indriss, killing him.  

The mercenaries then killed any corrupt nobles, and would never have helped.

The mercenaries left, stayed behind after a bit of persuasion.  She was a friend to the deva, who was left behind forcefully.  The Nurthian’s name was Lilmora, Mora for short.  She pushed for us to leave, using her emotions and ‘psionic’ power to push us through the door.  We managed to get a short way away before the mansion exploded.

Now it’s been a day since that incident.  Lilmora has shown me how to use the straight blade, and I find it much more useful at the moment than my spear.  We’re going to regroup, the four of us, in an inn in Sagon.  

Hopefully enough money has been made for the army in Dodaca.

-Human? Sentinel/Avenger Hybrid (Vincent with a bear named otto)
-Changeling Psion (Artemis)
-Human Cleric of pelor (Everett)
-Drow Ranger (Wyatt)

 The initial setup is that we are prisoners in the city of Ongar which is basically a giant prison/mining operation. We are being led into the prison for various reasons (for example, adventuring, or working for the various gangs) and some basic rules of the prison. When the rules are being explained iress says to not drop the soap getting an odd look from the warden guy. She also proceeds to call him jonny boy despite his protests. Anyway we get settled in our barrack and head off to the adventurer's guild to get some work. We find it ok and get hired for a job but 3 of us (wyatt, brog, and iress) attempt to prove themselves to the bartender/guy in charge of hiring adventurers. Wyatt tries to show off his archery but ends up botching two shots and smacking the string against his arm. He then proceeds to use arrow stairs (a ranger power) to climb up a building and get stuck when the arrows he used broke. Brog and Iress both unsuccessfully tried to lift a table and iress decided to challenge one of the bigger guys to an arm wrestling match. Somehow i end up rolling higher than him (despite him having +10 to strength vs my +8) and prove myself worthy to the bartender of being a fighter and not just some torch carrier. While this is going on Everett tries to find anyone who worships pelor and ends up finding one of the funnier priests there. He said well i do believe in what could be equated to a German trying to do a sterotypical southern gentlmen accent (dm's german).He also kept rambling on about chicken legs and when everett asked for a holy symbol he gave him a badge that looked like a chicken leg. Meanwhile Iress got drunk on strong alcohol on an empty stomach which resulted in her making an ass out of herself. When we make our way back to the barracks we find baskets of food left and there just happens to be chicken legs in there, which wyatt &amp; brog try eating/hiding (while drunk Iress tries to steal them from wyatt). We eventually go to bed and wake up the next morning (Iress having a massive hangover) to head out to some sort of tomb.
