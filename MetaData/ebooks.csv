I still see new folks jumping in and promoting their stuff and I'm letting that happen despite the rules simply because of time and effort .  However

* We've hit over 3
* We've added a new sister subreddit on our sidebar /r/KindleLend.  They are brand new and cater to the Kindle users who may want to share their books with their fellow redditors. 
* I'm thoroughly impressed by the evolution of articles and posts thus far since I joined up and am proud of you folks contributing.  Keep it up!
* Authors don't be shy to contact me or our Admin xamdam.  Mainly so we can get a dialogue going and so that we know if your post goes into the spam filter we'd be able to clean it out of there.

New e-readers are out and so are sites catered to ebooks.  Remember if you have any new links that you think your fellow readers would enjoy PM me!

The series revolves around the adventures of Lew, California. Mt. Lassen is a small mountain town, everyone knows everyone, and Lew is known around town as the small, bookish kid in his class. While the town of Lassen itself is quite ordinary, the surrounding wilderness is not. Lew's Grampa, it turns out, Sasquatch. Or so he thinks. Lew and Gramps embark one night to track the mythic beast, are the creatures which seems to ooze up from the wreckage. Ultimately, but with a cryptozoological twist.

I have a fixed layout book that looks great on the Kindle Fire

To create a book that degrades gracefully

However, when these lines are removed, the fire version is (obviously) ruined — but the Legacy Kindle version looks great: 
____

`meta name=""fixed-layout"" content=""true""/`

`meta name=""original-resolution"" content=""600x1024""/`           

`meta name=""orientation-lock"" content=""portrait""/`

`meta name=""RegionMagnification"" content=""true""/`
____

Is there a way to flag these lines of code in the OPF file as *KF8 only*? 

Barring that (because I do not think there is a way to do this)

The book was hand-coded as an EPUB file

**EPUB Conversion results *no errors* and *no warnings* in Kindlegen.**

The book is currently on the store [here.](http://www.amazon.com/The-Bently-Reserve-ebook/dp/B007PVTVTS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333127020&amp;sr=8-1). As you can see

Barring these solutions

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Amazon strongly recommends that we do not publish different device-oriented of the same book

If you're not a writer
A few days ago I posted in r/writing about a new publishing effort that a few of us were working on. There was a lot of interest and we spent days without sleep or work to put together something which, druidcitychef, and throwaway_writer have contributed tremendously and plan to contribute on an ongoing basis to create a community of awesome.
We want you to join the Pack Right Now. We're open for enrollments for the weekend.
From my previous post:
Here's the ideals guiding our group:
We believe that we're stronger together.

We will help each other achieve our goals.

We believe that when one person succeeds the whole group is helped.

We believe reddit writers deserve to make enough through self-publishing to afford a car wash now and then.
Based on these ideals we're going to try and begin a sort of ""imprint"" for self published, and benefit from increased downloads by members of the group.
If willing to participate
The benefit there is that, you expect higher rankings to kick-start your sales. With new books getting higher rankings (and which include a blurb about your own book) you also expect your own sales to increase.
Make sense?
We haven't worked it all out yet, (from design to logistics to layout to editing or just providing positive input, or maybe taking a leadership role as we organize) please comment below and I'll add you.
Thanks for reading. Really.

**Extinction Point (313 reviews

Reporter Emily Baxter has a great job, humanity is on the brink of extinction, wiped from the face of the earth in a few bloody moments, leaving Emily alone in an empty city. As she struggles to grasp the reality of her situation, Emily becomes the final witness to the end of our world... and the birth of a terrifying new one. 

The world she knew and loved is dead and gone. Now Emily must try to find a way out of New York as the truth behind the red rain is revealed: the earth no longer belongs to humanity.

**Toward Yesterday (68 reviews

What would you do if you suddenly found yourself twenty-five years in the past? For the nine-billion people of the year 2042 it's no longer a question ... it is a reality

When a seemingly simple experiment goes disastrously wrong, the dead live and the world has been thrust into chaos.

Contacted by the scientist responsible for the disaster, James must stop the certain extinction of humanity. But if the deluded leader of the Church of Second Redemption has his way, humanity will disappear into potentiality, and he is willing to do anything to ensure that happens. 

A serial killer, and James' lives are all inextricably bound together as they plummet towards an explosive final confrontation, the winner of which will decide the fate of humanity.

**Now on to the important stuff**:  

I'm sure some of you have by now realized that some things have been added to the sidebar of the subreddit.  **-----------------&gt;** (Look that way!)

Ebook sources, and general stuff that needed to be addressed to keep the submissions and discussions in line and in tip-top shape have been added.  Please, take a moment and familiarize yourselves with them.   

Xamdam and I have discussed that to keep the submissions nice and tidy those promoting their books will have to contact us.  This is to make sure that the feed doesn't get spammed with blogs and random miscellaneous promotional drives.  

To date these blog and misc. spam haven't been very successful, *you* the subscribers, and the spam filter.  So, from now on all authors, writers, or publishers will have to be approved by either xamdam or myself before they will be allowed to promote their stuff here.  This will stop legitimate authors from having their submissions lost to the spam filter.

We are a couple

Over lunch and a bottle of wine almost 2 years ago we came up with the idea to leave everything behind and start traveling. Our jobs give us that freedom as long as we have a internet connection to work from anywhere in the world.

So we came up with our site [For 91 Days](http://for91days.com)  - staying 3 month at a time in one spot. Which gives us enough time to really get to know a place and still have time to work on our ""day jobs"". 

So far we have been to Oviedo, Sicily - Sri Lanka and are currently in Busan.

The sites itself only make a small amount of income so traveling like this is just our expensive hobby but thanks to eReaders

We turned each location into eBooks. Everything you can read in the books you can read online. So we thought we are not even going to sell one book. Proven wrong! 

For some reason people like to read content without being connected to internet or by sitting in front of their computers. Who would have ever guessed! We are able to sell 1 - 2 ebooks a day. Which is not a lot but it does help!

Here is a link of all published books so far: [For 91 Days Travel Books](http://www.for91days.com/for-91-days-e-books/)

We offer them for free once in a while. I will announce free promotion days as comment here.

1327738802.0,p0bgb,A Proposal for this Sub-reddit and to our beloved Mod.,Sir_Meowsalot,12,5,15,"Hello fellow E-book readers

Having been a member of this sub-reddit for a while I find that something needs to be added to our little gathering spot.  I wish to propose the gathering of links to websites that offer E-books either for purchase or for free.  

These would be sites that allow authors from all over the Internet to ply their written goods with their consent (very important as I'm sure some of us believe that should foster in these authors the belief that their hard work should be rewarded and given credit).  A good example of such a site for instance would be our tried and trusted **Amazon** which offers such a service.

If we could put such sites and their appropriate links to the right side of this sub-reddit we'd be able to help folks new and old to the E-Book realm to find their reading material - and also stop those new and old here from asking where they can get materials for their brand new E-book reader.  

As you post a comment please take into consideration ladies and gentlemen to not repeat links that other posters put up (i.e. Amazon).  As well

Allow me to start by offering three place from which I gather my E-Books from:  

* [Kobo Books](http://www.kobobooks.com/)
* [Feed Books](http://www.feedbooks.com/)
* [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/)

Edit: As more links are posted by you folks I shall add them up here in a list for all to see what has been suggested negating any repeats:

* [Smashwords](http://www.smashwords.com/) 
* [Many Books](http://www.manybooks.net/)
* [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org/)
* [Book Yards](http://www.bookyards.com/)
* [eReader IQ](http://www.ereaderiq.com/)
* [Baen](http://www.baen.com/) 
* [Calibre E-Book Reader Software](http://calibre-ebook.com/) (has a search function for E-Books)

I'd like to know peoples' opinions about the best eBook Reader software for the iPad. The only specific requirement is that it should be able to read ePub format

1. Able to take advantage of the iPad 3's high resolution screen to deliver the best possible and cleanest text.

2. Features like bookmarking, if possible.

3. Built-in dictionary.

4. Ability to group books by author or type for easier searching.

5. Multiple backgrounds (like sepia) so I can find one which is most comfortable to my eyes.

Additionally, lit and pdf. Another plus would be a large number of included fonts (but good fonts with lots of hinting information to produce text that looks good on the high res screen).

I understand the iPad comes with iBooks preinstalled, but it's no longer under development.

Brought together by a series of unfortunate events,an Ex-Marine, and an engineering genius find themselves thrown together down a path from which there is no escape. Pressed into service or sworn to defend their planet, they are under orders from the United Nations Federation to traverse known space aboard the UNFS Manifest Destiny and face off with a sentient species of superior design. When the battle cannot be won and all that remains is annihilation, the crew must challenge their understanding of both time and space in order to escape. Out of power and crippled from their ordeal, they find themselves crash landed on a planet so vastly different yet similar to the home they left behind. With the enemy closing in from space and new battles to fight on the ground, the survivors must overcome their differences if they intend to beat the odds and make it out alive.

I'll be doing an AMAA/book discussion in /r/books on Thursday

[Here's the link to the book.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TPZ7XO/)

It's a first-hand account of my experience teaching at a high school in the rural southern US

It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:


[On whether teachers become attracted to students.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k858y/teachers_of_reddit_have_you_ever_fallen_in_love/c2i8xq4)

[On teaching evolution in a rural southern high school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/q0ee4/i_aint_even_mad/c3try9d)

[On a student who threatened to accuse me of sexual harassment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62u4)

[On a time where I tried to hold a lazy kid accountable and failed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62v2)

[The story that led me to quit teaching](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q6ags)

People read these posts and encouraged me to write the book.  So I did.  Now it's free if you want to read it.

If you're reading these words

If you download the book and read it

Heavily skewed toward the younger demographics

[r/Kindle post](http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/rg5ms/hey_rkindle_im_looking_to_start_a_business_around/)  
[r/ebooks post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/rg61m/hey_rebooks_im_looking_to_start_a_business_around/)

And here are the main topics discussed in the comments:

* There seems to be a lot of hate toward DRM and any sort of rights management
* International availability seems to be another hot topic
* Indie authors being available on *only* Kindle is an annoyance for non-Kindlers
* Many people wish e-books were cheaper
* Time-based valuation of books was a great idea brought up by several people
* E-books costing more than paperbacks gets a lot of hate
* Internationalization of books is a market that is yet to be tapped (I think)
* Well formatted e-books are better for consumption

There was also a fantastic (albeit lengthy) comment on the dangers of lowering the price of e-books

&gt; E-book pricing is a really complicated issue right now. Amazon pricing e-books at $9.99 out of the gate put us in danger of lowering the public's expectations for what a book is worth, and then think $30 for a hardcover book is outrageous. But (at least in Canada), book retailers strong-arm publishers for deep discounts (usually 50-60% off the cover price) and even then do not pay for stock until a customer has made a purchase. So consider that a hardcover book straight from a publisher costs a retailer $15, and they profit the rest of the cover price - not the publishers.

&gt; On the publisher's side of things, $15-$17 for an e-book is an incredibly fair deal. Especially if e-booksellers begin windowing, which is the process of dropping the price over time, or with different formats (ie, a hardcover comes out for $30, after some months of sales they release a trade paperback for $20, if it does well then a mass market edition for $10). This could be done with e-books: offering an enhanced version for slightly more money, and then dropping the price after a number of months.

&gt; My concern is that people shouting about high e-book prices could damage the publishing industry. I think it is important to communicate to consumers what an appropriate price for a product is, it's still a lot more affordable than buying that same book new in hardcover.

&gt; Readers have plenty of options to save money on book buying (buy used, borrowing from friends and libraries), so I can't sympathize with people who say e-book prices are too high. They just aren't.

Thank you everyone for helping me out with the research for my business idea. I think my original mission of ""showing publishers that it is economically beneficial to set lower prices for e-books"" will have to go back to the drawing board. The discussions over the past 24 hours have contributed a few alternative ideas
