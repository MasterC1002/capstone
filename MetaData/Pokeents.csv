Another thing that was appealing to me was the way the beginning of the rivalry between Ash and Gary unraveled. 

Here's what made me a dedicated fan from the get-go: Even though Pikachu and Ash did not get along right at the start, DESPITE the fact that they had bad chemistry from the beginning, I literally cried like a little baby. A horrible circumstance led to a powerful bond, filled with adventures and amazing discoveries.

Fourteen years later, and other merchandise, and sharing and playing with other kids who were just as hooked as I was is what MADE my childhood life bearable. And though I may not be as hard-core of a fan as some, it has been something that I can always refer back to for comfort. 

In a way, but poke'fans in general. Pokeeents is just a special gem in that world&lt;3

I'm glad we have our little corner of the internet for all the pure gold that has been posted here.

I want to first apologize for not keeping the place as spruced up as I used to or as spruced up as I'd like it to be.  That being said, and I have to remove some spammy stuff rarely, but everything else is moderated by you folks pretty well.

What I'm really looking for is someone with some CSS knowledge to come in and maybe give the stylesheet an overhall.  The flair system here is antiquated and the header is all sorts of fucked for several resolutions.

So if anyone is interested either post here or send me a message and I'll get back to you.

I appreciate everything you guys post.  Keep up the hilarious comments and the awesome OC.

It all started last December

Played the game through to completion. I felt like I was 12 again taking my DS with me everywhere with me in my backpack (since I was on crutches). Leveling wherever possible. I put in 150 hours on it and then one night I went to a friends house. I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came out my backpack was gone. A group who had come through to get a sack lifted it on their way out and my pokemon with it....

While ultimately in big picture they are only pixels so it is merely a sentimental loss, Venasaur Mewtwo and Shiny Dogs I got at the Gamestop promotion.

I got a new DS and picked up Black. Figured I'd start from scratch with the new generation...I miss my Charmander :(

1307946453.0,hybgs,My list of thoughts while watching Pokemon while high.,ColdJello,46,9,13,"Here is what i word for word wrote down while watching different pokemon episodes from different seasons randomly. 

- Why hasn't ash gotten with any of those girls?
- Since Ash is conquering his fourth region
- Maybe Ash smokes a balls load of weed and forgets things?
- Ash seems to get extremely lucky with random professional chefs following him around everywhere.
- Pikachu says ""PIKA PIKA"" every damn time Ash says something. Nobody wants your two cents pikachu.
- Why cant i wear one single outfit everyday? That would be bro
- Togapie was my least favorite sidekick for pikcahu
- Brock should be in every episode
- When are Professor Oak and Ashs Mom just going to fuck and marry eachother? Where the hell is Ashs Dad? Does he know that his wife is getting bent by an Oak?
- I need to smoke more 
- Charizard probably smoked so much he turned into a pacifist and decided on no more fighting.
- I really hate that emo hair cut on top of Staraptors head.
- The move attract is like some whore flashing her tits at a dirty bar
- I hate that half of every episode is watching team rocket make some dumb ass plan. 
- Maybe if Ash changed his clothes
- I'd just give them Pikachu and have my sidekick be Charizard
- Magmar is like the ginger of the pokemons
- When i get Pokemon Black im naming my Snivy
- I wonder if when im 50
- Windmill cookies are the shit",self,t5_2sfqa,False,,71,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokeents/comments/hybgs/my_list_of_thoughts_while_watching_pokemon_while/

I should mention that mario cart occasionally becomes more difficult than usual when the squid item is used and you can't see shit when you're really high...and it's not even that i just feel better at it; I win in brawl more when I'm faded. I still haven't played pokemon high. I'd imagine it makes the game fun again as you would worry less about stats and more about cool lookin 'mon and attacks.

I walked in at a [7], I noticed there were no price tags on or near any of the bongs.

I asked one of the employees how much the bongs were

All I could think was, and his response was: ""Sure you take this silver one, four pieces, and these two lighters.  All $89.""

Before my girlfriend could haggle any further

""Thank you so much sir, so I just pulled out my wallet with the lone Benjamin inside.

""You good guy, I assumed he was talking about the small beaker-style bong to his left, but no.  No, I was destined for Typhlosion, a two-foot chugger and the most solid piece of glass I have ever encountered.  With swirling orange designs, an icecatcher, and a clear chamber for watching the smoke curl and unfurl

Of course, because Lave Plume and Eruption are badass moves.  The orange swirls are a perfect artistic match for Typhlosion's mighty lava-borne, smoke-belching powers.  He can blast any seasoned ent into an oblivion of a guaranteed [7] or above with one hit.

I walked out of Big Al's in a whirlwind of nostalgia and a sense of fatherhood, but Typhlosion used Ember to melt the resin onto the downstem, thus securing the broken piece within the bong.  This left a rubber-on-rubber suction system, since the grommets on the bowlpiece were now in contact with the rubber ring that was melted partially to hold the downstem.  My bong managed to repair itself and as a result, I can still sesh with Typhlosion daily.

I have had Typhlosion for a while now, but if I had to bash somebody over the head with my pocket monster, Typhlosion would use Giga Impact and ruin their face.  Endgame = Typhlosion is hella boss, and I love my bong.",,False,self,False,t3_otdvv
