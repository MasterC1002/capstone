The things I can do: 
-shoot free throws around 50% 
-play basic defense
-make layups with my right hand and some with my left 
-basic dribbling
-passing. I think I can pass pretty well and have okay court vision from watching a lot. 

My problem areas: 
-shooting. I learned to shoot without jumping and now taking jump shots feels really weird. 
-rebounding. I'm 6' 3"" but I often still get outrebounded by smaller guys.

I want to congratulate you on doing such a fantastic job as League Commissioner and wish you the best in your future endeavors.

As a life time basketball fan I have tremendous respect for the League and the job you have done over the years, mainly by the Heat players.  I am neither a Spurs nor a Heat fan but simply a basketball fan as I watched The Finals (Knicks 2014!) this year.  However I strongly feel that talking back to the officials, whining about calls, or doing the arms up- out to the side- surprised pose, that so many on the Heat seemed to do is equally as detrimental to the game as flopping.  

In my sons peewee basketball league we teach the kids to play - key word - to play the game.  We are trying to build strong characters, character building traits basketball can instill in men.  The Spurs showed that professional players can simply do their job and play the game (key word - play the game) with class and integrity and will allow the officials to do their jobs.  Please do something about the talking back to officials and the whining face/pose that most players seem to make to ""plead"" their case.  Please help me explain to my son why he should celebrate the Spurs even after such a loss and not use certain Heat players as his role model - for life and for basketball.

Thank you.





EDIT::

After reading some replies I want to add a few points.  I agree that blindly accepting authority is not a good thing to teach kids or a good principal to live by.  However we are talking here about the game of basketball which has rules and that by agreeing to play this game you are agreeing to the rules.  

After getting my thoughts in writing I guess my main problem is simply how ridiculous a lot of the players look when they are whining or arguing with the officials

The people I play with school are pretty bad - they can shoot pretty good

However, but yeah...). Does anyone have some tips and drills for game preparation that I can do at home alone? or with a parent?

I'm the only one in my country town who even likes the sports enough to practice, and I've NEVER played a game with referee or whatever. I'm aware of the rules, it's just playing with 9 other people (and one or more who are better/as good as me) is what I'm not used to.

My preferred position is Point, but my three point is around 20-30%, not so good, and playing small forward I feel too limited (not enough court-vision, no real driving, no way to show handles). Plus small forwards on TV are like 6'8"" average (lebron) haha.

1348800254.0,10lln8,Question about layup fake and traveling,wangstagangsta,14,1,11,"Howdy gang

On a breakaway

However

Here is where I'm confused:

1.) Now that I'm alone under the basket

OR

2.) Do I have to jump off my right foot (or both feet) since it is now a pivot foot?

I feel like its option 2 but it feels really awkward jumping off my right foot.  

----------------------------------------------------------------

Another similar scenario:

I have the ball and I'm dribbling with my back to the basket in the post. I hop step and gather the ball in order to have the option of pivot foots.  I decide to spin on my left foot (counterclock wise) 180 degrees in order to face the basket. 

I show the shot and bait the defender to jump.  Then I step with my right foot under him.  

Now that I have taken 1 step (with right foot

1.) Get to lift my left foot off the ground as I attempt a layup with my left hand?

OR 

2.) have to jump off both feet in order to make the shot?

Again

Thanks for reading! These are all just local pickup games and I honestly don't think I'll be called if I do option 1 in either scenario,False,self,t5_2qhsv,False,,,t3_10lln8

1357162209.0,15uigs,my dream is dead,upnunder,11,4,8,"TL;DR this is just something i want to get off my chest.  my basketball dream is dead.

i fucking love playin ball.  it is my favorite activity other than sex.  my dream has always been to earn a living playing ball.  

my dream is *not* to play in the NBA.  people would ask, worked his fucking ass off and played in the 70s (people are just better now).  there was no hope for me being an athletic freak and i was pretty realistic even as a young kid.  it was just never gonna happen.  it seems silly to even think that i actually had to have these thoughts, but whatever i was just a kid.

after years of playing pickup in college

btw, i had a huge advantage.  they were still good, just different style.  they were skinnier, quicker, good shooters and euro-steppers.  only the clumsy guys played inside; there were huge guys that played like guards.  they called a lot of fouls on me in the beginning but i got the hang of it.  even if you get all ball on a rip or a block, if the contact is forceful enough it's still considered a foul to them.  it took me a long time to realize that.

it had never occurred to me that you could make money playing ball in europe.  one thing was that i never considered moving to another country (semi-permanently) until i was actually there.  so when my program ended i moved home and went back to college to finish up my senior year.  i went to a D1 state school and i was dead set on trying out for the team.  i was jacked up, so i looked into it and saw i could make (to me, again, not much) some solid dough getting better and playing at a higher level.  i'd get a job on the side in IT, my field, or speaking/teaching english if i had to, but fuck it

i trained pretty hard.  i played pick up games like 4-5 times a week and worked out.  i was cleaning 225, but they were basically shoe-ins (spelling?) hence why they transferred.  i was excited to at least see where i stood in the tryouts, ya know?  i didnt really think i would make it, but i was strong and in good shape and having fun. i mean, i was still living my life too.

2 months before the tryouts i was playing pickup with some friends and i came down on someone and sprained my ankle.  i had no idea sprains were that bad, looking back, that my dream died.  

i met a girl, but ill never do anything more than pick up games.  im not moving to europe or anywhere.  im only 23, but i got my family, my girl, who i live with, and my job.  my dream is dead and there is nothing i can do about it.  feels bad man, feels bad.  im just a pathetic wanna be who set a pathetic goal and couldnt reach it.  im a nobody who failed at becoming a nobody.  im just one of those typical douchy guys who plays pick up at the gym.  i was never *that* good, ya know?  i love the game and i figured this sub can at least relate to that part and so i dont have to explain it.  i just wanted to get that off my chest.

* Tips/Tricks to stop the defender from cutting you off from your path to the basket.
* What to do when the defender is blocking your path and the help defense comes form the other side.

2) How do you protect the ball when going for a layup and the defender is right next to you ready to swipe the ball or hold for a jump ball?
 
* I've tried putting the ball far away from the defender on the other side but usually it's easier for the help defense to get it.

1370878729.0,1g1srs,my best move (in painful detail). post yours if you'd like!,asdjmo,6,0,3,"As a gift, so I will be painfully thorough.  OK

**Get the ball in the post (step 0):** this is a post move.  Set yourself up 2-3 feet above the block.  Post up with your elbows out, even if they deserve to be.  

(I am going to assume you are on the left block from now on)

**Set up (step 1):** OK, maybe do a different move.  If you are too far out, take one dribble and use your body to gain some ground on your defender to get a little closer.  If you are in the sweet spot, don’t hesitate.  When you catch the ball immediately make a dribble with your left hand and then half spin to your left side, like a drop step left.  In this motion, you are dribbling and then dropping your left shoulder back while taking a small step toward the block with your left foot.  Imagine you were going to dribble, quickly fake left and then go right for a fade-away—this is exactly the action you want to do (minus shooting the fade-away).  This is effective for two reasons 1) you pick up your dribble.  Defenders are more likely to jump/bite on the fake if you pick up your dribble.  2) the jab left it really sells the shot fake.  Both are really subtle and the key is doing them quickly and smoothly.

**The fake (step 2):**  so you have dribbled

**The prestige (step 3):** you have done the shot fake and your defender is now jumping out of his shorts trying to block it (seriously this almost always works on the first time, it does expose the ball to the defender (also results in too much contact sometimes) but you should do this instead: reverse pivot on your right foot and spin back to the left with total disregard for human life.  You are undoing the steps that got you in the shot fake position, plus spinning a little bit more to get your body squared to go up for a layup.  The reverse spin also looks cooler and can be done faster and more gracefully.  The downside is you break eye contact with the basket but you be able to re-orient yourself quickly, especially with practice.  Now just make the damn shot!  

This works on every kind of defender.  I can usually feel when I am posting someone up, like he is ready to pounce.  I love doing this when I am guarding the best guy on the floor.  I am surprised how much it works against smaller guys, but they jump like crazy.  Bigger guys too--especially bigger guys, actually.  When you post up a bigger guy, you are like attacking his ego or something and he really wants to put you in your place.   A caveat is that when I do this move on guys that are 6’6 and over, some can fall for the shot fake and still recover to block the lay-up.  If the guy on you is really athletic and huge you may have to dribble, half-spin left, spin left

**TL;DR catch ball above left block in post, pivot right into shot fake, spin left, layup.  ‘Up and under with reverse pivot’**

The other day I was playing in a pick up game, but it was a pick up game so I didn't argue.  Anyways, even if I did jump off of my non pivot foot, would that still be a travel?  I know you're supposed to get two steps, and most of the time that's when you're running towards the basket.  I don't know if it applies differently when your back is to the basket or if you don't dribble out of the post.  Most of what I've found doesn't address specific situations.

_____

Hi Reddit, its really hard for me to be able to find people to play with and am wondering if anyone can identify and/or give some advice on how to make things easier.

I am currently 22 and have no problem finding people to play pick-up with at the college I am currently attending. That said

When I go to parks or rec centers with the intention of playing pick up with people

I can't help but wonder if this is merely the result of my own personal situation. For starters, I don't dress like your archetypal ball player: my shorts are rarely long, and I can't go spending the extra dollar on ""underarmor"" or ""Nike"" brand apparel (again, sans the shoes). I also didn't play on a high school team so I lack some of the fancy ball handling, like under the leg dribbling that one develops from drills. 

That said, a high jump (can touch rim, can 't dunk), and basically, a decent basketball IQ. 

Another theory I have is that I am just simply too out of touch with the type of people that I usually run into at these types of places. Please don't misconstrue that as me saying that ""all people that play pickup are like ___, but there's at least that common link). 

When I try to talk to people in order to meet people or try to get a game I can't avoid (for lack of better words) ""sounding white."" I can't help being shy no matter how much I try to. Its frustrating because I can't think of another social realm in which I feel like I struggle so much. Believe me

I've tried many alternatives like playing in a rec. league and trying to get a group of friends together. The rec. league was simply too much commitment and $. As for playing with friends

I feel like I am running out of options and fear that I'll have to give up what is currently my favorite pass time. THUS

it occurred to me recently that maybe its as simple as frequenting a place as often as possible until I get acquainted with people by mere virtue of familiarity, pick-up bball is something I care about so any help would be welcome. 

~~~~~~~

**EDIT**: Thanks so much for the advise. I guess its up to good ol' fashioned perseverance. It feels good to hear that I am not alone in feeling like this.  ",self,t5_2qhsv,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/mzorz/playing_pickup_with_strangers_when_youre_a/

I've only been able to find photos online showing the front label (NBA and Spalding logos) but I need more photos than that. It is impossible for me to make *accurate* vent label textures without a reference. Sure I could simply slap in a generic vent and call it done but I'm aiming for photorealism.

Does anyone here own any of these four basketballs?

1. NBA Development League: http://i.imgur.com/CpAJ8DN.jpg

2. NBA ""Tack-Soft"": http://i.imgur.com/D0eYflp.jpg

3. NBA ??: http://i.imgur.com/HXeqiZI.jpg

4. NBA Platinum Street Ball: http://i.imgur.com/cLNNL3N.jpg

I would need at least two photos of each basketball. One close-up photo directly from the side showing the area where the channels meet and another close-up photo showing the vent and the label around it. The label and channels should be straight on

The lighting conditions aren't too important as I am simply using these photos as reference

I would create a vector of the vent label using your photo as a reference and then use a bitmap of that vector in a commercial model. Nothing from your photo is directly used in my textures. I need the photo of the channels for the 3D model to get a rough idea how wide (and the shape if it differs from the traditional 8 panel design) the panels are at the ends.

Below are two images I rendered of the 3D model I have already completed. These are types of photos I need of the real basketballs.

www.BallersInstitute.com
Push-ups
Push-ups are another functional sport-specific exercise that trains a movement regularly seen in a basketball game. Increasing upper body strength with push-ups can improve passing and shooting ability. Start with your hands and feet on the ground
Lateral Line Hops
Agility and quickness are skills that are used to play defense or run down loose balls. Lateral line hops train ground reaction and footwork to improve agility and quickness. Stand next to any line on the basketball court and hop horizontally over the line as fast as possible for 20 seconds. Take a 10-second rest and repeat for another 20 seconds. Complete a total of eight rounds following 20 seconds on and 10 seconds off.
Sit-ups
Sit-ups can improve abdominal strength. Basketball players use their abdominals for core stability while running and playing defense. Start by lying on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Crunch your torso up towards your knees as far as you can go
Box Jumps
Jumping exercises can improve rebounding and jump shots. Set a box about 20 inches off the floor and stand next to the box. Jump explosively and land on top of the box. Either step down or jump down to the starting position
Lunges
Lunges can increase running speed
Shuttle Run
A basketball game is full of accelerations and decelerations as the players change directions. The shuttle run is designed to improve your defensive ability by teaching you to change directions quickly and powerfully. Start on a baseline and run to the closest free throw line, change directions and run to half court. Upon reaching half court, touch the line and run back to the baseline. Change directions at the baseline and run to the opposite free throw line. Touch the line, return to the baseline, touch the line and run to the opposite baseline. Touch that line and return to the starting point.
Jump Rope
Jumping rope can improve stamina
Pull-ups
Pull-ups are a classic upper-body exercise that is sport-specific to basketball. They train nearly every muscle in the upper-body
Deadlift
Deadlifts can increase lower-body strength that will result in stronger box-outs to obtain more rebounds. They can also increase your vertical jump by training the major muscles involved in jumping. Set the deadlift bar at a weight that is challenging for five repetitions and perform a total of five sets.

I roll my ankle (either one) at least a few times through the year. Most likely 4-5. It all started early in highschool and although I've never actually broken an ankle or tore a tendon

It has felt worse lately. As in- I don't just roll them by accidently stepping on a foot

I wear high bball shoes (derrick roses) and have large legs (I've always read ankle injuries are a result of weak calves

Recently I purchased a 60$ ankle brace for the one foot after an injury and it feels really nice and secure. But just yesterday I rolled the other one! mother fucker! My question is- is there anyway to solve this without grabbing another brace for the other foot?

Just tips are also good, and so on. Preferably gym-related since I won't have a lot of places I can practice basketball drills because we stop practicing until september, but I'll try my best.
I play center(2.10m/6'11"" height and 140kgs/310 pounds weight) for the local under-18/19 teams and I'm gonna play for the 2nd division team soon. Recently started working out at the gym, but who can jump almost 3 feet and play the same position. Also, what about those weights you put on/above your ankles? I've read somewhere that they cause more damage than do good when it comes to strengthening your legs but I can't help but wonder why everyone is wearing them if they're so bad.
Some low-post moves would also be very helpful. I rely a lot on a pump fake and after that a hook shot from the outside, I don't have a lot of time to think my move through so I just go with the hook-shot after I back down into the defender a bit. My coach isn't helping at all, he's not teaching me anything(except for how to drive from the high-post after he realised I could be pretty unstoppable if I kept doing it), and I can't really limit myself to just 2 moves on offense for scoring(save for the occasional putback after an offensive board). I feel that because of my bigger size and weight, most of the local defenders won't stand a chance when I start backing down, and they don't do either. The problem is finishing around the rim. I can get to it with ease, but I can't finish the play.
The last thing that's been bugging me is a pretty common problem: free-throw shooting. I have a good release, I'm shooting 40-50% on a normal day and 60% on a good day). I've considered shooting underhand, like Rick Barry used to, and I even found a youtube video of him teaching how to do it(can't say I ever tried to do so. it just seemed so weird). I personally wouldn't feel any shame or anything shooting like that. After all, who can argue with how you shoot it as long as you're making most of your free throws? Anyway, I'd love an opinion regarding this style of shooting, if you can call it that(I know I should try it and see if it fits me well first

Thanks in advance

1335100173.0,smknc,Looking for ideas for a dunk contest.,wittyrandomusername,5,2,4,"I asked this in [/r/AskReddit](/r/AskReddit) and nobody cared.  Maybe I'll have better luck with actual basketball fans here.

I'm playing in a basketball tournament with my brother in a week and a half and they have a slam dunk contest. I can barely touch the rim
To give some idea of his athletic ability
He really wants to get creative about this. All the guys who participate are athletic so it won't be enough to show off his jumping ability. We are trying to think of something creative that hasn't been done before. Something that will surprise the crowd.
My idea was that I stand in the crowd with a basketball making sure that nobody knows that he's my brother or that we even know each other. Then he'll take his ball
Any other ideas are greatly appreciated.
If we come up with any good ideas,False,self,t5_2qhsv,False,,,t3_smknc

Unfortunately I have zero coaching experience; however

We have been losing games and I am becoming frustrated with myself.  Does anyone have any advice for a first-time coach in a youth girls' league?
