A few caveats:

- I'm not in charge of any design decisions on the game - if you are looking to get something changed

- I'm not aware of every single bug in the game

- I am British and likely to use dry humor (but note: I spell things American now)

**General Tips**

* Not sure which crew skills go together or which one you want to pick? Refer to this chart

* Press Control + U twice to reload your user interface to fix common UI issues.

* Press Control + Shift + F to view your frames per second (displays in bottom left corner). Green indicates GPU

* Right clicking a mob will fire off whatever ability is in your 1 slot.

* Always log out in a Catina

* If you don't like your conversation gains (light/dark or companion affection)

* When you first walk into the Fleet to pickup your crew skills

* To leave a Flash Point after completing it

* If you want to gain levels fast, and daily PvP missions.

* To visibly see your alignment (light/dark) gains without hovering over the choices

* To enable looting in an area

* You have an Emergency Fleet Pass with an 18 hour cooldown you can use, downloading the **free** mobile authenticator gives you access to cheap Fleet Passes that have only a one hour cooldown.

* You don't have to keep crafting materials on you

* When leveling your crafting skill

* When you get around level 20, don't blow it all on crew skills.

* Type /stuck if you get stuck anywhere.  Also works great for raiding

* Once you get your Advanced Class, the other is for your Advanced Class (Sith Assassin, Jedi Guardian for example).

* If you don't like the crafting missions that are offered to you

* Gaining companionship means your crew skills go faster for that said person.

**PvE Tips**

* If your companion is very low on life after battle

* Similar to the previous one

* If you're having trouble with a class boss, use your 20 minute companion cooldown ability and pop the same ability again. Inquisitor example: electrocute (four second stun), once electrocute fades, use Channel the Force and place Electrocute on the target again. That's 8 seconds the mob is stunned and you take no damage.

* Using a Companion Health Pack will rez him during combat.

* Press the space bar in Space Combat to do a barrel roll

**PvP Tips**

* The PvP vendor offers amazing gear at level 20 and level 40 for very low cost that is better than anything else available at your level (typically).

* In the Huttball warzone

* In Huttball

* In the Civil War warzone

* In the Void Star warzone

Last night, and then vanished away. I sat there for another three or four minutes; got up and went to get a drink, and when I came back the mob had spawned. I attacked him, and immediately after I took aggro, the Operative jumped in and helped me wipe him out. I didn't ask, he didn't offer. He just stuck around because he knew it would be a tough fight, and because he was a nice guy.

Meanwhile, killed the mob, and saved the player.

It's people like these who make this game fun to play, which is kind of the point.

We missed out on a great opportunity to learn about the history of the game. We could have found out about some hilarious bugs from the start

I know this won't be the popular opinion but there's gotta be other people out there who are ashamed at how many questions were repeated over and over about the same bugs and same requested features that have been on the forums since the start.

EDIT: I'd also like to add, or get someone like Georg Zoeller or Daniel Erickson who could talk about their future visions of the game.

If in a year or two or three+ this game is still popular - and hopefully it is - this will be something very cool to have on your account. 

The game has problems, I have faith that broken things will be fixed and I will continue to support them for the time being in hopes that my $15 will do its part to help in the development of what could be an awesome game for years to come (hell, I would even pay $30 if they told me it would bring about swoop bike racing faster). 

This title says that you helped to create something; a title that years from now will signify your efforts in the creation of a world. A world where everyone else who came after you owes a slight debt of gratitude to you for your role in the stabilization of this games foundation. 

So here is to all the other founders out there. I raise a glass to you!! Cheers!!

1325694994.0,o2mzi,"There seems to be a fair bit of confusion about this, so: here's how patches work. ",ostrakon,802,260,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o2mzi/there_seems_to_be_a_fair_bit_of_confusion_about/, this patch sucks; they didn't fix anything that was important

Just so we're clear:

1) the devs don't spend the downtime actually fixing bugs. It's not like the servers go down

2) Not all bugs/issues are created equally. Don't get offended that some bug you deem gamebreaking doesn't get fixed immediately. Minor bugs are often only a few lines of code and some minor testing to fix. Larger bugs might require a shitton of work, that process might reveal bugs in other segments of the game. 

3) Just because minor bugfixes are making it into the patch doesn't mean that they aren't progressing on major ones. The fact is that a lot of the minor bugs get handed off to junior devs who  can handle them easily enough because they're simple problems that often amount to the programming equivalent of a typo that made it past spellcheck. The big ones have to get looked at by the senior guys

**EDIT 1:** One thing I want to point out as well is that this was intended to be for someone hitting 50 and wanting to prepare for raiding/Operations. I don't talk about Ops as a gearing method at all

**EDIT 2:** Added my suggestions on End Game gear progression (in conclusion) and refined some descriptions.


**PvE Gearing**

1. Ilum and Belsavis Dailies - This is probably the most significant source of pre-raid PvE gearing available right now. Well, as well as the quest rewards, you should be able to buy an Epic Armoring/Hilt/Barrell, and you'll get an Epic Enhancement, Mod, and Companion Weapon from the quests. That means that doing your Belsavis and Ilum dailies basically gets you a piece of epic gear per day with the rewards. This is a must do for PvE gear. It also gets your companions pretty geared out because of the repeatable quest that gets them a moddable level 50 weapon.

2. Hard Mode Flashpoints - The way these work is that the bosses up to the final boss will drop epic gear, but here's a quick suggestion:

   * Black Talon - This is pretty easy

   * Boarding Party - Semi-long instance with challenging final boss. Poor reward for time invested.

   * The Foundry - Last boss is no longer bugged. 2nd boss is semi-difficult.

   * Directive 7 - Straight-forward and alot of trash you can skip. Bulwark will get alot more difficult once you can't interrupt his stuff. 

   * The Battle for Ilum - Not too bad. One tough boss (Krel).

   * The False Emperor - Can skip and creatively eliminate lots of trash (knock them off

Here's a great image that was posted here and shows where to get what loot form HMFPs: [LINK](http://i.imgur.com/kZp3I.png)

3. Tokens/Commendations - Similar to the badge system in WoW (or Valor Points), actually would have Sith Sorcerer bonuses because it was intended for them...do some research before making the purchase).

4. Flashpoint Dailies/Weeklies - These are straightforward and gotten from the Fleet. Complete 1/day and 3/week to get the max reward. Basically you'll just be doing Black Talon to complete this quest. 

**PvP Gearing**


1. Champion Gear Bags - There are a variety of ways to get these (described below). They will have Centurion Commendations, 7 for PvP Daily, 3 for Ilum Weekly, 3 for PvP Weekly). Additionally, any purchased bags are icing on the cake.

2. Battlemaster Gear Bag - These are similar to Champion Gear Bags

3. Currency and Gear Purchase - Champion and Battlemaster bags are purchased with Commendations, but can also be gotten on Ilum and Tattooine, by participating in World PvP and getting chests. Basically, for every 800 Warzone Commendations you get, you'll be able to get a chance at a piece of gear from a bag (by converting down some of those to Merc Comms).

4. Battle for Ilum - On the fleet you will get a Daily and a Weekly to contribute to the War Effort on Ilum by taking control points on the western portion of the planet. This is pretty straightforward, though random.

5. Daily and Weekly PvP Wins - These two quests are picked up on the Fleet. Win 3 matches a day

**Crafting**

1. This is self-explanatory


**Conclusions** 


So as you can see, and you get the Expertise stat on the gear (which is a PvP only stat that increases PvP Helaing, increases dmg/reduces dmg vs. Players). Do your Ilum Control point daily/weekly, and your PvP daily/weekly to max out gear gain here. Only bad thing is that it's random what's in the gear bag, so it's entirely possible to get nothing or an item you already have. 

It's definitely worth doing your Ilum and Belsavis dailies for Tionese Crystals and for the Epic mods/enhancements/Armorings

Flashpoint Dailies/Weeklies seem to only be worth doing if you just do Black Talon. Sadly

Finally

Late 40s/50 Quest Gear -&gt; Moddable Gear bolstered by Daily Rewards|Tionese Gear -&gt; PvP Champion Bags|Columi Gear (Normal Mode 8man/HMFPs) -&gt; PvP Battlemaster|Rakata Gear

Feel free to add/correct anything I've put in here. I'll edit this as I see more info come in (especially info/opinions on the Flashpoint worthwhileness).

I don't have any doubt that EA was pushing for a finalized date, with EA settling on the 20th.


There is a reason two of the most successful game developers have a ""When it's done"" approach to release dates. Things come up


Yes, many of you would have paid 14.99 a month for beta access, especially knowing you could keep your character.


And don't try to say that you shouldn't be charged for the game yet, and everything else that come from having millions of people on the servers.


So here we are


And if you're wondering if they care? Of course they do. [Look here](http://www.swtor.com/patchnotes/1.0.2c/162012). The game has been out 24ish days

Customer: ""Hey
Bioware:""Oh, it should be fine now.""


It's frustrating to see something with so great be bogged down with so many problems. But I'm sure it's TONS harder for them. It's their baby


I know this was a rant, awesome. I'll leave you with...

&gt;Hammond: ""When they opened Disneyland in 1956 nothing worked."" 

&gt;Ian: ""Yeah

**Edit:** Additionally the servers aren't up. People will complain about this. They said two, they give guesses.

As for me personally, each of the 8 stories are more involved than ANY single player game out...AND more engaging. They clearly love this game and are working tirelessly to fix it. It will be polished soon. As for me, I'll be here with them on the road there.

**Edit 2:** Some fun observations:
Many people(2nd place post atm) are *complaining*(Irony?) that there really aren't any complainers on here so my words are wasted.
 
Many of the posts are people complaining about the game

Quite a few people have posted something similar to ""What problems? It's been smooth for me""

Others are posting that the game is completely unplayable and clearly must be that way for everyone

A large number of people complain that the game is unfinished and that is unacceptable. Those same people have yet to let me know the date that WoW was finished.

As hard as I would have thought it would be to claim that this launch is a sign of declining quality

A surprising amount of people hate playing this game, and hate even having to post here, and hate....

Hey


I couldn't agree more with it. After reaching 50 in SWTOR I found myself falling back into the old rut of sitting in queues and grinding out daily quests - things that I don't find particularly fulfilling. That is

My friend [Imperial Agent Sniper] and I [Bounty Hunter Powertech] were queuing for Warzones

* **Me:** *""Hey... X and Y (two friends) are leveling Republic characters now
 
* **IA Friend:** *""Yeah. They are around level 40 now
 
* **Me:** *""Good... Log into your Republic character to see if they are on.""*

Sure enough

Now

My friend, on the other hand, decided to flex a little muscle to get some information.

In the middle of a path

* **Me:** *""Go ahead

Her body disappeared

* **Jedi:** *""Okay

* **Me:** *""We're looking for two people: X and Y. Ask around

* **Jedi:** *""Are you guys RPing?""*

* **Me:** *[uses Quell to pistol whip the Jedi] ""TELL US WHERE THE REBELS ARE.""*

* **Jedi:** *""Fine. Will you stop pointing that [blaster] at me?""*

* **IA Friend:** *""No.""*


Meanwhile

* **X:** *This guy in general just said that there are two Imperials looking for us.*

* **Y:** *Who would be after us?*

* **X:** *(Presumably looks at Teamspeak and notices my IA friend sitting in their channel silently [Or the Jedi gave them names]) Oh

The Jedi had tipped them off. We were displeased with her lack of cooperation and put her out of her misery before we continued our search.

Back at square one, X and Y were careful not to discuss any of their surroundings in too much detail when talking to each other on teamspeak.

This continued for about half an hour until X accidentally mentioned a type of NPC that they needed to kill for a quest. I knew where those NPCs were.

We hurried off to the location in the shipyards. After a bit

We opened fire on X (a Jedi Guardian). Laughter and the words ""They found us!"" were heard in Teamspeak. Y (a Gunslinger), he was outgunned (and outleveled).

With our targets eliminated we left Hoth and I called it a night.

Easily the most fun I have had in an MMO in years.

Today was the day I met my new student, but a bit nervous. This was after all a kid who for the last six months hadn´t talked to _anyone_ except over a computer, hadn´t left the room except for food and toilet for the same amount of time, and had kicked out / ignored the last teacher to enter his domain.. And sure enough, I enter, get a look, and the focus is back on the computer ^-^

But aha! He is pvp´ing! And by the looks of it, and when he dies I proclaim a masterful ""stupid smugglers!"". 

Now, and as he runs back for revenge he starts telling me about how long he played, why he is on the dark side, and how the server is pvp-wise. 

Seriously! We didn´t shut up! When the pvp was over, and focused on my tasks. I hadn´t brought much, to keep the first time short and sweet, but when that was done we talked about dogs, games, and made a plan for our next lesson. I managed to fall off my chair at one point, talented as I am

At the end of our lesson, and promising to be up and ready to go out on our adventure next time. We will visit a new game store that has opened:D

1324011961.0,net67,Please try to understand how servers work in MMOs,Kingofskillz,406,106,263,"It is sad to see all the complaints about how bad Bioware is dealing with the issue of servers being full during peak hours and the ~10-30 minute queues on almost every server.

To all the complainers:

Understand that in two months when the original hype has died down and players who have been playing 8-10 hours a day since they were admitted into early access will go back to their normal lives and play maybe if they're lucky 8-10 hours a week?  How about the players that bought the game

In my opinion Bioware is doing a pretty decent job with their launch of this game.  Yeah it is annoying to wait in queues to play but I'd rather wait now then come 2-6 months down the road have completely dead servers that lose their fun because there is not enough players playing on them to find groups, etc.

A server develops a community and that community evolves and grows and I know that a good amount of people don't want to have to combine the community that has grown on their server with a completely different community from another server.  God forbid everyone from the ""Dead"" server gets placed into another random server.  At that point the whole community is lost.

This is why Bioware is trying to limit the amount of servers to the smallest number possible so that later down the road there isn't the issue of dead servers.  Don't keep saying Bioware is doing a bad job and they should have known how many people preordered blah blah blah.  Bioware knows how many people preordered and they know roughly how many servers they need.  They will be adding new servers as they see fit through the rest of early access and probably right before launch day.

TLDR; Before you get angry about the queue times on all the servers during peak hours go read up on what happened to Rift. They quickly ran into the issue of dead servers and had to combine servers.  IMO Queue times at release are better than dead servers 2-6 months from now

The crafting.  God the crafting in this game is fucking perfect for my tastes.  I don't have to go anywhere, and diplomacy.  I am amazed at biochem, I kept disassembling med kits and stims and eventually got the schematics for purple reusable med kits and stims.  The medkit is a HUGE bonus because it only requires lvl 8, restores 1k hp and is reusable, with a 90s cooldown.  That's sooo helpful. The next rank is way better so i am just waiting for it.  Also the stims, when you get a reusable one, it's like a constant main stat upgrade when you think about it.  Willpower is my main stat and I have the reusable stim that gives +16 wp for 1hr.

(last updated Dec. 1)

*To anyone reading

#**Basic stuff:**

All characters in TOR use one primary stat of Aim

- Knights &amp; Warriors use Strength
- Consulars &amp; Inquisitors use Willpower  
- Smugglers &amp; Imperial Agents use Cunning
- Troopers &amp; Bounty Hunters use Aim

Primary stats are then broken down into 2 catagories: Tech and Force

Tech:

- Aim gives Ranged crit and 0.2 ranged damage
- Cunning gives Tech crit and 0.2 Tech power 

Force:

- Strength gives Melee crit and 0.2 melee damage
- Willpower gives Force crit and 0.2 force power

Force stats are useless to Tech uses

The primary stat for each class will also inherit the benefits of it's shared (force or tech) stat. This means that if I'm playing a Warrior, and a small amount of melee and force crit. I will still get the force power and crit bonuses if I have Willpower on my gear, but ultimately, the only primary stat you should ever itemize for is Strength.

Endurance gives everyone 10 HP per point (before talents)


Secondary stats are: 

* Presence - boots companion health
* Power - adds melee
* Force/Tech Power - Found on weapons
* Accuracy - Increases the chance to land attacks and abilities. Reduces dodge/deflect chance for the target over 100%
* Crit - gives melee
* Surge - increased critical damage (base crits are 150%)
* Armor - reduces physical
* Defense - increases Dodge/Deflect (deflect is dodge against ranged for lightsaber users)
* Shield - increases chance to be shielded when attacked
* Absorption - increases the % of damage shaved off shielded attacks
* Alacrity - Cast &amp; Channel Haste
* Expertise - PvP exclusive stat. Increases damage and healing done


#**Item Rarity Levels**

Converting from WoW rarity levels:

- Uncommon = Premium
- Rare = Prototype
- Epic = Artifact

The fourth item rarity is Custom (or moddable) which we'll get to later.


#**Basic Equipment Information:**


All character have 10 armor slots

10 slots are: Head, Waist, Legs, Feet, Wrists, Ear and 2 Implants

Most gear has ""rating (*xx*)"" on it

Mainhands Weapons: Lightsabers (single and double), Sniper Rifles, Assault Cannons, and Electrostaves. Companions will also use weapons such as Techblades and Techstaves that are not intended for player use, as they would not provide effective stats to any class.

Offhands: Focus, Lightsabers, Blaster Pistols, Knives, Scatterguns.

Relics: Relics are basically trinkets. Some will have active use abilities (giving crit, those created with Matrix Shards, have static stats. You can only ever have one Matrix Shard created relic. Matrix Shards are items obtained from datacrons, which are static world objects that are usually hidden and give cool bonuses like small amounts of permanent stats. 

Most gear is itemized currently so item types have correct core stats (i.e.

Some gear also has Light/Dark requirements. For example, and has extremely minimal impact on gameplay beyond cosmetics. That is to say, there is no item it the game without an alternative that is identical in stats in the event it has a light or dark requirement.


**Companions:**

They share the core-stat system and all wear armor of a certain type. They do not have relic slots

Droid companions have different gear, 2 Motors (Gloves/Feet), and 2 Parts (belt/bracers) and they all use +AIM as a stat. They still use Ear and Implant slots, sport regular Blaster-type weapons (pistols or rifles), and use normal off-hands (sheilds or generators.)

Companions cannot equip items that have light/dark requirements. They can


#**How Custom &amp; Moddable Equipment Works:**

It should be first stated that not all items have mod slots and cannot be upgraded in any way. There are absolutely no moddable ear pieces, but it is believed they are not intended to exist (they are significantly better than non-moddable versions and incredibly rare.)

There are 7 types of mods in game: Hilts, Mods, Enhancements Color Crystals, and Augments (we'll talk about Augments later).

There are 2 types of moddable items: Custom and moddable. 

On Custom items

Moddable items have static values for their armor, Barrels and Armoring, so those types of mod slots are absent from the items. This effectively ""locks"" a moddable item into a certain rating.

Moddable items are currently all high level epic items in order to prevent players from simply taking the hilt/barrel/armoring out of their gear and selling them to other players as they upgrade their raid gear. This seriously impinges on the ""customization"" aspect of the mod system

Mods and Enhancements are on every moddable and custom item in game and provide primary and secondary stats, and all provide +Endurance and 1-2 secondary stats (no low level enhancements give secondary stats).

Color Crystals are on every weapon in the game (custom, Power, and Crit for stats and will change the color of the lightsaber blade or bullets fired.

For a fee


**Augments:**

Augment slots are found on critical crafted items

Anything crafted can have an augment slot, making critical crafted fully moddable items potentially the best pre-raid items in the game.

Moddable items (raid drops) will all have high enough ratings to make up for the augment differences

Right around the beginning of February, as work hit hard and I didn't have as much time as I did before.

In the past couple of weeks, I played in the beta for TERA, I tried out STO again since it went F2P, as well as DCUO (both games I originally subscribed to).  Throughout all of those games, something just felt like it was missing.

Then I launched SWTOR (and waited a while for patching :-P).  It was quickly apparent what was missing from those other games: the cinematic, but that's honestly what it started feeling like after playing the other MMOs.  Even making another Smuggler (my first 50) and knowing the story, it was amazing.  The narrative, the cinematic feel, everything just felt awesome.   I honestly can't go back to the traditional MMO anymore.  I think people who have played SWTOR will feel the same when they go back to others, and that makes me think that SWTOR has some *serious* staying power in the MMO race.

I'm so out of the loop now with updates to SWTOR

To this day every one I have played which were, SG, EVE, and vanilla wow, were all buggy as heck coming out. It's part of when an MMO is released there are several things crafty players discover and exploit that are unexpected. Not to mention problems with server stability and many other issues that most people don't consider when starting these said mmos. Even StarCraft and Diablo II were chaotic on release, does anybody remember being able to dupe anything with a potion in Diablo I? 

My point is that all the people that are jumping off board for the sake of bugs to go to GW2 is going to be humorous to me. I think GW2 has potential as well to be a good game. Not having a monthly fee though will make bugs from release linger for up to six months though and understandably too

Vanilla wow was so bad you would completely crash on looting items off mobs in the STARTING areas. Or you would be stuck for at least 5 minutes before it would release the item to you or even let you keep moving. But I miss the hell out of vanilla wow that was an outstanding mmo experience all around to say the least. 

For those of you already done with ALL of the content and refuse to level an alt to see the other story lines. You're playing the wrong MMO that was the most advertised part and the fact that pvp is already as good as it is was a huge shock to me.

The % time off is between 1% and 15%

**Floor((X+1000)/(733+1/3))=Y%** OR

**Floor(3 * (X+1000) / 2200) = Y%**

X is your current affection level and Y is the % your mission times is reduced by.

**Ceiling((733+1/3) * Y% - 1000) = X** OR

**Ceiling((2200 * Y% / 3) - 1000) = X**

For instance, you'll jump from 12% reduction to 13% reduction.

This should help those who are doing a lot of crafting and seeing that their companions are almost to the next affection level.  Invest in some companion gifts should push it over the edge to the next %

Here's an easy table of what affection level you need in order to get to a certain % (for those who don't like math):


* 1%: -267

* 2%: 467

* 3%: 1200

* 4%: 1934

* 5%: 2667

* 6%: 3400

* 7%: 4134

* 8%: 4867

* 9%: 5600

* 10%: 6334

* 11%: 7067

* 12%: 7800

* 13%: 8534

* 14%: 9267

* 15%: 10000

These numbers may be a few points off here and there

Happy crafting!

To keep a long story short, this couple (husband and wife?) showed me the ropes of the game, helped me level, were just really friendly, and gave me an overall awesome MMO experience. I've played WoW for YEARS (just quit about 3mos ago) and had never been treated so well... plus it was a lot of fun.

By the end of it all (it was seven hours

The wife responded with ""A few months of restrictions? Playing something you enjoy? Nope. Not having it."" and **gave me a 60-day game time code.** Just... gave it to me. They then spent another hour explaining all the new features I had with being subbed. (Whole new world. Really.)

At the end of it all I just thanked them profusely and we all logged off. I didn't see them the rest of the weekend (I assume they were on their 50s)

**EDIT:** Thanks all for the welcomes! Further testament to the how great the SWTOR community is. Also, so I hope that's what happened and I wasn't blocked. &gt;.&gt; I remember her name started with an Ay and he has 3 50's, she has 6. I also know her legacy name is Stardream because she said they ""totally stole it"" for the ship in the Rakghoul event (thanks Google!). I'm on the Prophecy of the Five server.

It's a work in progress currently.  The vast majority of the prep work is done, and of course I'll make adaptations for Imperial classes. While I know most of these classes and specs fairly well, if someone sees something they would consider blatantly wrong, please by all means let me know and I'll look at it and annotate the video and make sure the text edition is correct.  I hope this helps!

So Mitth'raw'nuruodo went by Thrawn; his given name ""raw"" (the middle name in Chiss form) surrounded by the last sound of his first family name and the first sound of his last family name. In the same vein, i.e. Hess'irolia'nuruodo goes by Irolia. **EDIT:** Not always the case. Female names can certainly follow the naming conventions that I've laid out as 'male.'

Technically Chiss would expect any inferior to use their full name, so that two brothers would share the same first part of their name (Mitth for Thrawn). I have no fucking clue what the last part of the name represents (Nuruodo for Thrawn). Maybe something that has meaning only among the family or something. (**EDIT:** The final part of the name is apparently tied to a professional family and I guess reflects station or status, below comments.) Anyway the point is, the legacy name would be the first part of the name.

So the end result of all that is simply that, then your Chiss's character name should start with the same sound that your Legacy name ends with. That is, I believe Grand Admiral Thrawn's character name would be Thrawn, and his legacy name would be Mitth. Nuruodo wouldn't be entered into any of SWTOR's name fields, and I don't know where that part of the Chiss name comes into play ayway.

1326694082.0,oiz5z,Companion affection explained,stillnotking,281,73,79,"This is an expansion on my previous post: http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/npx61/companion_affection_tips/

That post contained a few errors and wasn't very complete. I still don't have all the exact numbers

**Conversation**

The most common way to gain (or lose!) affection with companions is to have them with you during cut scenes, if you're interested. Less commonly, there will be choices they strongly approve of, which have a base +40 gain, or strongly disapprove of, for a base loss of -30. In very rare cases there will be dialogue options that give much larger gains (usually restricted to romances, but sometimes also available during companion quests). The largest I've seen was +550

Tips for increasing companion affection through dialogue:

* You can hit ESC to cancel a cut scene and start over, because -- as we all know -- what comes out of your character's mouth can be quite different from what the dialogue wheel said.
* You **do** gain or lose affection if your companion is currently deployed on a crew skill task, if they are not physically present, you won't see the tab pop up at the bottom of the screen, so you won't know how they reacted until later.
* Affection gains/losses from conversation aren't applied until you turn in the quest that the cut scene was part of.
* You can swap companions in and out for cut scenes in order to gain affection with those you don't normally use in combat. The downside of doing this is that you may have to cancel a crew mission from time to time.

**Gifts**

Gift affection is slightly more complicated. There are five ranks of gifts, purple) and ten categories (Weapons, Trophies, etc.). The most counter-intuitive aspect is the ranks. They correspond to five ""tiers"" of companion affection, which are 0-2000, 2001-4000, etc. up to 10000 max. It is always best to give your companion a gift of a rank that corresponds to their current affection tier, it gets a 0.5 affection gain multiplier, even if it's a very small amount.) Conversely

Gift categories are a reflection of the companion's specific preferences. Military companions often like Weapons and Military Gear; scientists and droids often like Technology; criminal types like Underworld Goods, Medium, Low, and Indifferent. For a rank 1 green gift given to a companion with less than 2000 affection, the gains will be +96, +54, +24, 2.25, and obviously you should give them gifts of that category whenever possible. There are different emotes for each interest level as well.

Quality is fairly self-explanatory because it corresponds to the same system as item valuation: purple is better than blue is better than green. I don't have the exact multipliers.

Tips for increasing companion affection with gifts:

* Identify their High interest category and get them to *at least* 2000 affection as soon as you acquire them. Try to get even more if you don't plan on using them much as an active companion. Rank 1 green gifts only cost 200 credits from a vendor, so it's better to give gifts early.
* Becoming romantically involved with a companion changes their gift preferences
* All Mission skills can provide companion gifts. Gift missions are usually cheap, because it gives you gift fragments that can be redeemed on the Fleet for specific desired categories (other skills' gift missions are a crap shoot).
* When buying gifts on the GTN
* When giving a lot of one type of gift
* The categories listed in the game code for gift preferences are misleading, ""Favorite"", and ""Loves"", in ascending order. Be aware that if you're looking at a guide that uses those terms, the ""Favorite"" category isn't actually their favorite.

Edit: Just for trivia's sake, but a few were missed here and there. AFAIK no vendors sell them. They give less affection than greens.

Edit 2: Thanks to kadaan in the comments

**Base gift value: +24 affection**

Companion Preference Multiplier

* Indifferent: 0
* Low (Likes): 1
* Medium (Favorite): 2.25
* High (Loves): 4

Gift Quality Multiplier

* Green: 1
* Blue: 1.66
* Purple: 5

1323099508.0,n16bw,My SWTOR Review (We cannot repel text of that magnitude!),EvadableMoxie,273,70,176,"This will be a rather long look at SWTOR

I have been in the Beta since late June and I've played multiple character up to around level 40 or so.  I'm not going to do a traditional review where I issue a number value for various aspects of the game.  Instead I am going to go through what SWTOR is, what they've done wrong, and my hopes and concerns for the game in the future.

**So

Unfortunately the first thing people say when they dismiss SWTOR (Usually before playing it) is SWTOR is a WoW clone.  If it is or not depends on your definition of the term 'clone.'  If you distil anything down to its very basics you can mock it.  We could say all FPSs are clones because all you do is shoot people

SWTOR is similar to WoW in that they are the same genre and sub-genre of MMORPG.  The main reason it gets called a clone is because MMORPG is a very vague term that could be used to describe everything from WoW to EvE Online

SWTOR follows in the traditions of EverQuest and WoW in a type of MMORPG sometimes called a 'theme park' MMO.  When Blizzard came onto the scene with WoW, and cherry picked the good aspects of the genre and left out the bad, while innovating as much as possible.  Bioware has done the same thing, and as a result, they take much from WoW in the same way WoW took much from EverQuest. We may not all remember it, but WoW was called an Everquest clone at the time of it's release too.

So

Now, let's stick to gameplay.  In WoW you typically fight 1 on 1 battles over and over.  In SWTOR you have a companion and fight packs of enemies even while soloing, which makes things a lot more dynamtic and interesting. SWTOR has no auto-attack forcing you to be more active.  No character in SWTOR uses mana (No, not even Sorcs/Sages, it's just a bigger energy pool), rather they all have various forms of rage or energy which means there are no long periods of auto-attacking to regen mana.  SWTOR utilizes mini-instances for most group or boss content rather the phasing which feels a lot smoother then WoW.  I've always found phasing to be rather jarring when NPCs or resources appear or disappear as I move back and forth across the phasing line, and phasing has a lot of negative aspects to open world pvp and grouping.  

SWTOR's mini instancing feels like an innovation in this respect because the phases are clearly marked and cannot be entered while in combat preventing hit and run attacks on open world pvp servers.

I could go on about the anti-down time features such as medical probes or how everyone has an out of combat heal that doesn't require food or water.  I could discuss in detail how addicting the crafting system is and how you'll want to create and RE everything just to unlock new recipes

To me the difference between a clone and simply a new entry in the same genre is innovation

If you don't like MMORPGs, you'll be disappointed.

It's also not KOTOR III, Dragon Age and Mass Effect and thought to yourself this would be awesome if it was an MMO, then this is your game.  If you hate MMOs and online gaming then perhaps not.  Don't get me wrong, even if you only solo the game is still fun, but you have to deal with all of the downsides to an MMO which isn't a particularly good deal if you aren't interested in the positives.

**Does Story Really Matter?**

Until you've played SWTOR I don't think you can fully appreciate how much fully voiced cut scenes add to the enjoyment of playing an MMO.  It's very easy to say it's all just collecting X and killing Y, and if you want a game where you don't do those things, you are looking in the wrong genre.

When people dismiss the story and immersion in the game, and narrative and all FPSes are the same: point and shoot.  Context is a very powerful thing.  If you cut the story and narrative out of Mass Effect, Dragon Age, or KOTOR, you aren't left with much either, but that isn't a fair way to judge those games.  It's like saying someone is a weakling because they are only alive thanks to their heart, and if you cut out they'd die.  

The fact is context and story do matter, telling the captain he's relieved then executing him for refusing orders.  It's about a million times better when you get to do in front of your friends.  It's especially exciting when you don't know what your friends will do, or even if you do know, you don't know who will win the roll.  

It is actually fun to level rather then being a chore you have to get out of the way before you can experience the end game like it is in wow. That isn't to say it doesn't get old and lose some of it's appeal over time

[in this thread](http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=101553)

Basically what they're saying is abilities for classes and their mirrors aren't exactly the same a lot of the time. I've noticed this from playing an operative in beta

Some of these are a blatant numbers issue such as CD's or how long an effect lasts

I'll keep a list of differences I've found in the OP from the thread linked above and posts scattered throughout.


Jedi Knight / Sith Warrior:

- JG's Freezing Force slows for 6 seconds

[Freezing Force](http://www.torhead.com/ability/9xVgSEF) :
[Chilling Scream](http://www.torhead.com/ability/7eLd3W2/chilling-scream)

- JK Blade Storm has a wind up time (the jedi visibly pulls his hand back) and a travel time (both moves are 10m)

Jedi Consular / Sith Inquisitor:

- Project (Cons) doesn't damage until projectile hits

Trooper / Bounty Hunter:

- Mortar Volley (Trooper) takes about 2 seconds for any damage to be registered in the area

Smuggler / Imperial Agent:

- The talent Accomplished Sawbones (Scoundrel) provides a 5%/10%/15% crit healing bonus opposed to Accomplished Doctor (Op) 10%/20%/30%. 

[Accomplished Sawbones](http://www.torhead.com/ability/gjPW4oM) / [Ingame](http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/9778/screenshot2012010821343.jpg) : [Accomplished Doctor](http://www.torhead.com/ability/86nQ9PR)

- Flash Bang (IA) has a 60 sec CD

[Flash Bang](http://www.torhead.com/ability/f5R2qsF/flash-bang) : [Flash Grenade](http://www.torhead.com/ability/fT8pWgj/flash-grenade) / [Ingame](http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/2577/screenshot2012010821342.jpg)

- Debilitate can be used while moving

- Smuggler Sab Charge takes time to get to the target

That's all I have so far. I will be adding more to the list as I find them posted or find them ingame. I just wanted to get the word out because these **are** game changing problems (especially under smuggler/IA)

Also

Edit: I should note I've only confirmed the JK/SW and Smuggler/IA as I have played those classes personally and experienced the differences. Any confirmation for the other classes would be appreciated.

First of all, I didn't play the game at first because I was afraid of being tagged a ""Star Wars nerd"" just for playing the game. I eventually came to the conclusion that it couldn't be worse than being a ""WoW nerd"" which, admitedly, I already was. So I sucked it up and bought the game. I now have a level 50 Jedi Sage and I have to admit, I enjoy the shit out of it.

I spacebar through almost every quest dialogue. Yep, no. The cinematic stuff is a huge selling point for some people and even I enjoy watching certain conversations unfold from time to time. It's not my cup of tea but I can't hate on it since it doesn't actually take anything away from my gaming experience. My point is that I am not wrapped up in the storyline (a major selling point for the game) and my goal while levelling is pretty much: get to level cap. That being said, levelling a character up to 50 has been the most enjoyable experience in any MMO I have ever played -- even without the slightest idea of what my class quest is all about. It was a grind that never quite felt... grindy, if you will.

So I finally get to the max level and am ready to finally ""play the game"" as I would say. First thing's first -- I need gear. A bit of online research tells me that Recruit PVP blues are a good starting place for both PVE and PVP so I farm up a set. This is even easier to do now since there is a new PVP mission that practically says ""Gratz on 50 here's some starter gear to help you not suck"" which I think is AMAZING and other games should really take a hint (I'm looking at you, I am very satisfied with the quality and difficulty level of the content. I have yet to see any of these ""bugs"" that people claim exist but maybe I'm just extremely lucky.

It's time to try some of this infamous level-50 PVP. It's a little rough at first but having the Recruit gear definitely helps me feel less squishy and as I get more Battlemaster gear I start to feel much more confident in the ring. The objective-based gameplay, which I love. Sometimes I get stunlocked to death and it sucks but it happens only when I have multiple people beating on me. It's not like the majority of my experiences in WoW where a single player can completely lock you down until they have single-handedly chiselled away your health to zero before you have a chance to fight back. I'd like to also add that giving players a free ""trinket"" is again something that certain other MMORPGs should take note of. 

I hit the forums for some tips and am overwhelmed by the sheer volume of players complaining about PVP imbalance. In highschool I had a friend who, yet none of them agree on the best spec, stat balances or strategy. Hell, I remember when video game defeat inspired innovation. When something wasn't working we tried a new approach. But many of these players insist that their way is best and therefore blame the system for short-selling them instead of just changing up their strategy. Oh well, maybe this generation is just imbued with an unrealistic sense of entitlement. I suppose that's a different topic for a different thread. As far as ""balance"" goes, I will rate this game on par with the WoW standard in terms of player vs player combat and far above that in terms of Warzone maps + team play. But hey, this is just like, man.

So what's next on my endgame to-do list? Raids... err, and a raid-spot as the second healer for our 8-man ops groups. I must have been lucky because again I never saw any ""bugs"" that people always talk about. This is where I finally start to sink into that endgame groove. Operations twice a week with a bit of daily mission grinding to keep my credits at a reasonable level. I check the GTN from time to time to see if I can snag a cheap upgrade. I max out my professions and make my Rakata medpacs, stims and adrenals. For a while there I was doing HM Flashpoints for fun but was disappointed that they didn't offer better rewards. Thankfully the group finder changed everything for the better and now I try to run at least a daily FP to score some quick Black Hole comms to save up for that sexy gear.

So here I am now. My guild has been progressing nicely, my focus will shift more to the PVP gear grind, doing dailies, playing the GTN, exploring planets I skipped over, repeating a few space missions and outfitting my ship with the best mods, collecting crafting recipes, discovering all the lore objects, and only then Willl I be able to honestly consider the notion of endgame being lackluster

I'm a nice guy. I go out of my way to take a break when I start getting heated, and it's a shame more people don't act this way. I've, personally, seen attitudes in a general decline over the last couple months. 
  
  
I'm an avid PVPer -- always have been. I look at PVE as testing yourself against *mostly* expected mechanics, upset about what happened there. It's okay, though, I let that go. I can't be mad at players for taking advantage of(/using) game mechanics they did not, themselves, create.
  
  
I do everything I can to avoid Ilum because, however, I'd be one of the richest people on the server.
  
  
Sometimes I think players are killing MMOs for me -- and it's a shame
  
  
""please just let them score so we can get the fuck outta here""
  
""the majority of this team should unsubb""
  
""u guys fucking suck fuck u""
  
Then there's always the ragequit cycle. Two people leave a losing game, more people get screwed, more people leave, rinse and repeat until the game times out.
  
  
I've been killing time, for PVE -- he's now in columi/rakata, and I'm in the same spot I was a month ago.
  
  
Sometimes you win warzones. Sometimes you lose them. People need to get used to that
  
  
I apologize for the rant

When the balloon finally appeared, which I assumed was the intergalactic sign of peace. Knowing we only had a few seconds to get on the balloon, I jumped up once then ran to make the leap.  He was right behind me on his speeder and when we were both safely inside quickly established our non-aggression pact. It was a great, albeit long, flight. Thodger, my new Imp friend, and I were showing off our companions and cool skills and discussing the game

After exchanging WTFs, we were both a bit impatient and made our companions fight for entertainment. A hot chick fighting a midget (in this case, Jawa) is always fun to watch, which got me thinking about making book on a ""Companion Fighting Ring"" we could hold in the open world PvP on Tatooine, but I digress. After a while the balloon showed up so we headed back up top. As I am lining up for my jump, I see Thodgar say, ""please don't attack him"".  I turn around to see 3 red tags standing right behind me. I was pretty sure that was it for me but Xypin and Traxious were totally cool and we all jumped on the balloon for a pretty damn fun half hour ride. In fact the funniest thing to me was after we all got the datacrons, the Powertech stops

I know that wasn't the most gripping tale as it was a fairly uneventful trip but I told it because this is the kind of thing that makes PvP servers awesome.  I will fondly remember today's adventure over any run through Karagga's Palace. And no doubt it only happened this way because of the 3 cool Imps that I hope I never see on Ilum ;)

**looking for group**: This is probably my biggest complaint to date, that automatically queues and matches people. That's fine with me. For the love of god though, at least give us more space in the /who lfg comment to, you know, write down our spec/role, our flashpoint(s) and/or heroic quests of choice, and possibly even other characters you have/could play for something. In addition to that, in a universe with light speed drives and holocalling that we can't send a damn text message to Quesh to see if anyone wants to run the foundry. The dev team has done an awesome job making cool and unique stories for each class/role. Now they need to keep it going and allow the part of the game that many people enjoy (dungeons and raiding) to be easier to get going. I want to heal. I enjoy healing. It's a powerful feeling to know that the lives of your group rest squarely in the palm of your hand. I respec'd in and out of it until my respec cost was like 22k or something and finally gave up until 50 because it is obnoxious to sit in town and spam chat for 45 minutes or an hour trying to find a group. Solo leveling as a full healing build is totally do-able but it is *slow as balls*. This shouldn't even be an issue in 2012
 
**trade market**: The simple fact that I can't just type in (or, dropdown -&gt; armoring, press search, *then* type in ""20"" in the search field and press enter. Why cant I just type ""armoring 20"" -&gt; enter -&gt; &lt;a list of items I wanted to see&gt;. Seriously, I'm going to have an aneurysm. 

Another thing about the trade market interface is the fact that you can't tell it to save your pricing. For instance, you're better than that.

**trade skills:** Only thing on the trade skills that grinds the gearage is that you can't link your ""cataloge"" into chat. Please just let me say ""[Cybertech 400] Looking for work"" with a link to what I can make. It just makes transactions smoother and easier than ""hey, is that cool?"" ""oh yeah, that thing is actually better blah blah blah"". They can just look and see what you have and then ask you to make something. That being said, I actually really like the trade skills mechanics. Lets you have professions while removing the really mundane bits (farming ore, crafting a million &lt;shit item here&gt;, etc). I'd much rather send my crew off for 45 minutes to complete some boring crap while I adventure. So good work on that.

**inventory/bank:** When I have a stack of something in my bank... and I have a stack of that same thing in my inventory... and I put the stuff from my inventory into my bank *it should automatically stack on the other stack*. All I have on this one is a good ol' ""wtf guys?"". The item icons are already pretty similar looking for materials


**skill trees:** This one is more just personal observation of my own class (sith sorc). I have yet to play the other classes in-depth so I don't know if it's as bad elsewhere. In any case, for 4 or 5 years. Among others of course, I have an 85 resto druid and a 60 warlock. The sorc in swtor is like an even more generic version of an affliction lock, an arcane mage, and a resto druid mix, almost to a T. Dots build, nukechannel/aoe build, a fast heal, don't know about other classes yet but the one I have played just seems like it is so... lack-luster.

**in-game support:** Alright, right? Right. So I hop on and start trashing some quests right in their faceal regions, and, low and behold, I finish act 1! ""Tiiiits"", I thought, ""time to make a bangin' Legacy name"". Fast forward a day, my drunken-ass self made my *Legacy* name ""you're a towel"". Permanently. For every character. Shit. ""Well, and help me fix this stupidity."" NOPE! I got essentially a prerecorded response from a ""protocol droid"" saying that, if it would have been a real GM who messaged me and told me that he was sorry but they couldn't fix that at the current time

Anyway, rage, report me to bioware, go play a game, go outside, or whatever the hell else you might feel like doing. I just wanted to rant for a bit really.

All that being said, and made into reality by programmers. I want this game to survive because I think it has the potential, the dev team needs to listen to the community, be open to suggestions, and change the little irksome things in a quick and efficient manner. Even the smallest things, if you have to deal with them 150 times a day, will get horribly obnoxious over several months or even years of playing. Also, smooth out skill chaining please.

**2:00pm-Operations/Flashpoints Discussion**

38% of level 50 players have played in an operation

We know there are lots of bugs – particularly in Eternity Vault

With game testing and feedback things go a lot smoother – i..e KP launch much bettr

looting system in normal needs improvements – we wanted to make it pug friendly so you don’t have to yield to masterloot – we will deviate from this a bit in the next update. another thing we want to do is allow you to trade destined loot

existing operations are pretty easy – we want hardmodes and nightmare be more challenging than they are right now

amoring debuffs from players stacking together – not suppose to – something we will address in the future
hard and nightmare give same loot – we know that. 

Explosive conflict: harder than current operations. needs a whole new level of coordinate rather than more gear and more stats. We want to focus on coordination and execution. 

Takes place on Denova

Nightmare mode will be a more serious channelnge

Nightmare mode of explosive conflict not launched with 1.2

changing normal mode to story diffculty mode to reflect the diffculty.

story mode of new raid is not too gear dependent

orange gear viability – in 1.2 you can extract all the mods and set bonuses. 

can reverse engineer operation gear for appearances

Nightmare mode for Explosive conflict will have a different gear tier than hardmode

future of operations: bug fiixng is the highest priorty

fight the boss not the game – more ingame animations to give you clue on boss abilities

Flashpoints: they are enjoyable but we need better endgame progression via flashpoints. We want to smmoth the curve to operations.

Difficult to find group: we are addressing that

Lost Island – finish the story started in patch 1.1

Group finder: introduced in game-update 1.3 – also for heroic quests and flashpoints. single server only. community is very important. 

 
Q&amp; A

Q: trash drop credits on operations to help pay repair bill? also what initiatives to allow high level players to help lower level players (reverse mentoring system)..A:  with 1.2 we don’t anticipate changes to the repair costs. We need to bring additional sinks in place if we want to change the repair costs. No ETA on reverse mentoring system

Q: will we see separate lockouts for hardmodes and nightmare with 1.2. A: no

Q: 16m and 8m A: we want them to have a relative diffculty, recipes) but same tier of loot. 16m and 8m will have the same content for now.

Q: Timestamp achivement for boss kills to help foster competition? A: yes that is something we very much do. We love achievements. We want to reward server first kils things etc. These are long term plans

Q: not big difference between columi and rakata

Q: threat meters

Q: is craftable gear comparable to endgame pvp/pve gear? A: yes but we wil deter it to another panel.

Q: space missions – interesting but any plans to implant them into flashpoints/operations? A: we have a secret project for space missions in the works right now – can’t give you more details.

Q: enrage mechanics – is that soemthing we will see across the board? It limits the standard build you can take and have guaranteed success. A: intention is that in 8 man you have 2 tanks but that didn’t work out too well. with 1.2 you going need a lot more coordinate and tank –trading you will need 2 tanks for 1.2 raid content. 

Q: lucas style of fighting? players split to do stuff – like 2 guys fighting a sith

Q: 16m intended to be harder than 8m? A: the idea is to keep the diffculty level betwene the two as close as possible – we will make 16m bosses a bit easier to compensate for the raid coordinattion in 16m. 

Q: as an ops leader are we going to get more tools to shift people around in ops groups? A: On the UI panel there is more discussion but yes we want to have more options. 

Q: ready check system for flashpoints and operations? A: we don’t have a ready check? I am going back to the office and get that in. 

Q: are we going to implent hardmdoes for flashpoints that currently do not have them? A; yes eventually we will be. can’t say when exactly. 

Q: you can reverse eng ops gear – can you get schematics from that? A: yes
Q: flashpoints – another diffculty added to flashpoints A: not in the near future. we will keep adding new flashpoints and the flashpoints are going to get harder. 

Q: Dynamic style operations? i.e. more open world A: yes in 1.2 we will have open world bosses.

1325715744.0,o32sq,New Year's PvP Update. (Developer Blog),Mavec,217,47,165,"Fellow PvPers

In the first week after launch there were over a million Warzone matches played, having won 53% of all Alderaan Civil War and Voidstar matches (across all servers). Huttball has been played the most, accounting for 39% of all matches – and yes, we’ll be adding a new same faction vs. same faction enabled Warzone in the future.

We are all really excited at the tremendous volume of participation we’ve seen in PvP thus far. Your interest and demand dictates what we’ll be delivering in the near future. I wanted to give you some insight into where we are with PvP development and where we are going.

First and foremost here is what we are addressing as a top priority:

Level 50 Bracket Warzones: Level 50 players will have a bracket of their own

Open World PvP on Ilum: The planet of Ilum currently allows for open world PvP even on a PvE server, restricting Companion Characters from the area, and revisions to rewards. Ilum will also become a major source of Valor. Valor buffs will increase and decrease based on the objectives your faction owns. These buffs increase the amount of Valor you receive per player kill. However they do not give anything in and of themselves, so players will still need to defeat other players for significant Valor rewards. Additionally, daily and weekly missions will require player kills to complete. Player kills for quests and Valor credit will have diminishing returns per player killed. So, the more players that are fighting other players, the better it is for everyone.

Combat Gameplay: You’ll see several optimizations come online in January

We also have other exciting features coming in the near future including Ranked Warzone Matches, more Warzone medals for different objectives, Guard Optimizations and Target Optimizations.

Additionally we’re looking at ways to enable team vs. team

This is not a complete list of everything we’re working on that’s PvP related

* Unlock is account wide rather than just legacy wide (i.e. applied to all servers
* Available to all eight classes (both factions)
* Both male and female
* Cool new fur patterns
* Great social emote for your Cathar pride
* Trooper companion Aric Jordan will be have his appearance adjusted to bring him inline with the new Cathar models. He will be utilizing the new fur technology and better reflect how Cathars will look.

I wanted it to make very clear to everyone that both The Reddit Republic and The Reddit Empire have both decided to move to the Death Wind Corridor server.


It has come to our attention that the original server that we were assigned to, we have decided that it would be better for the long term success of our guild to move servers now rather than down the road.

**Why Tor-fashion.com?**

Tor-fashion.com is a project idea I shared with Zoopercat from AskMrRobot.com a while back. With every patch in SWTOR, the point I am getting at is that the options we have right now are insufficient. Everyday you see people asking what is that gorgeous looking armor set, how do you get armor set, how does this set look etc. Bioware artists have created literally thousands of different armor models but sadly most us only get to see maybe 10% of that during our in-game lifetime. 

**What is Tor-fashion.com?**

Tor-fashion.com is a project I started with AMR to attempt to fill the void. It focuses on full orange armor sets with good quality screenshots of actual people wearing them. It is a very manual process as I need to first get my hands on the set (GTN, sending tells to random players on the fleet, etc) and then get people to wear/model them for me so I can get good quality screenshots. 

The end goal of this project is to 

1) Have a list of all the moddable (orange or purple) armor sets in the game with high quality in-game screenshots (front

2) Every set should have an Imperial version and a Republic version at least (unless they are faction specific)

3) Every set should also have a female and male screenshots. 

4) If I want to get really fancy

**What is available at release?**

* [Social armor sets](http://tor-fashion.com/social-gear-sets/) (missing the Corellia rank 6 outfit and the male versions)

* [Armormech crafted orange sets](http://tor-fashion.com/armormech-crafted-sets/) (some of the sets only have screenshots for one faction)

* [Synthweaver crafted orange sets](http://tor-fashion.com/synthweaver-crafted-sets/) (some of the sets only have screenshots for one faction)

* [End-game armors sets](http://tor-fashion.com/endgame-armor-sets/) (War Hero

* [Planetary &amp; Flashpoint](http://tor-fashion.com/heroic-quest-gear-sets/) (Missing quite alot unfortunately. Alot of the planetary sets have set pieces missing due to removal from the game or some are just random drops off mobs)

**How can you help?**

I have made it really easy (I hope) to contribute. If you have an orange set that isn't listed or if you find a set with missing pictures etc

Your character name and server will be reflected on the page for that set to give you credit. 

To maintain the quality of images and uniformity of the site, I would be happy to create a character on your server and meet up to take some screenshots for you. 


Anyways, Female &amp; Male, Size 1 and Size 4 equivalents, you will be disappointed. However, with the help from the SWTOR community, I am hoping that will be a reality one day. 

It is my hopes that this project will get to a stage that it will be a great asset for 1.3 when you have alot more flexibility in your SWTOR fashion!                                2/5

Some sets that I really like 

Voss mystic - social 5 http://tor-fashion.com/2012/05/12/voss-mystic/

Hoth Hailstorm brotherhood - social 4 (very unique look) http://tor-fashion.com/2012/05/11/hailstorm-brotherhood/

So it's pretty much all the gear you get towards and in the end-game.

In the release build
  
""- Modifiable Artifact quality items now only feature modification and enhancement slots.""  
  
Now let me explain in a newcomer terms
  
Before the change, enhancement slot and Mod slot.  
  
All the modifications came with stats
  
You could swap around the modifications as much as you like so if you found a cooler looking lightsaber that had better hilt and color crystal but poor enhancement and mod

Now with the change introduced in this build, mod slot and enhancement slot, both of them just add stats to the weapon, so you can't remove the important modification, like the hilt, and use it in the lightsaber of your choice to bring it to the same level of that epic weapon(stat-wise). 
  
What it means is that if you go to a raid(operation) and an epic lightsaber drops
  
Same goes for armor slots, armor and base item damage.  
  
It's a big slap in the face because I really loved that and being able to choose your look was a big selling point of this game for me.  
  
Here's an official forum feedback thread if you would like to let the BW know what you think.

2.) Is the content being added a game savior?  Is it enough for people to keep playing?  Based on the amount of time it took to release this major update

1376443374.0,1kbhzt,A guide to the upcoming Bounty Contract Week,dulfy,168,14,57,"Hey everyone

**Important change**

* They made it so that the Completed Bounty Contracts you get are tradeable. This means you can unlock Kingpin bounties on day 1 on a character if you trade them all to one character or buy them from other players. 

**Where do I go?**

* Once the event have started

* Talking to them will give you a one time mission to head to the Cartel Bazaar (south most end of the fleet for Empire players

* From the Cartel Bazaar

* You need to be level 15 + to participate. 

* This event only lasts 1 week every month so make sure to do them when it is on or you will have to wait for the next month. 

**Henchman Bounties**

* You will start off with Henchman Bounties for the first 5 days of the event. The mission terminal have a choice of 6 planets and you can **pick any one of them** to start off. (These missions do have level requirements but if you are above Level 42 you can do any of the planets).

* You can only do 1 Henchman bounty per day per character. However

* Each Henchman bounty you do will give you a Completed Bounty Contact (in addition to a blue rep item and some basic commendations)

* Once you have 5 Completed Bounty Contracts on a character

* Henchman Bounties follow a basic pattern: 

    1) Travel to planet X 

    2) Short convo with the NPC in planet X 

    3) Collect info from shady characters located in a cantina somewhere in planet X 

    4) Talk to a contact with some short convo/same sex flirt options 

    5) Locate the Henchman target and either kill or capture them.

* The main road block will be in step 3, not every interaction with them is successful (~30% failure rate?)

* To interact with them

* You do not need to stand and wait for the Shady Characters once you have interacted with them. Move onto the next Shady Character immediately. 

* I have drawn maps with locations of most Shady Characters for every planet in my Henchman guide. They might come in handy for tricky locations like Hutta/Dromund Kaas. 

* You can try group up with other players to make step 3 faster.

* Once you get to the Henchman target, you can simply kill the Henchman. 

* For every Henchman (there are 8 in total)

* There are five possible Henchmans for every planet and which one you get is purely random. In addition

* In the later months of Bounty Contract Week

**Kingpin Bounties**

* You will need to have 5 Completed Bounty Contracts to unlock a Kingpin mission. 

* Each unlock is character specific and once unlocked

* Like Henchman bounties

* Once you picked up the Kingpin mission for a specific planet

* Each unlock will give you a blue rep item

* Once you have unlocked your first Kingpin bounty

* Kingpin bounties follows a different pattern

    1) Travel to Planet X

    2) A different short convo with same NPC on planet X

    3) You get sent to a location to release some bounty probes and then you will use provided macrobinoculars to scan them (fairly easy to find). 

    4) Once you scanned 5 bounty probes


* The bottleneck for Kingpin bounties will be at step 4 since there is only one Kingpin per planet. Kingpins can be soloed if you are in say at least Arkanian/Black Market gear but it is always faster to do it with other players and reduce the lineup at the same time. 

* Like with the Henchmans

1318947197.0,lga9n,General impressions of beta from a WoW veteran (state of the game).,i_r_throwawayX,188,34,290,"swtor.com is down for maintenance for most of the day I think and I'm not sure but the beta servers might be down too.  I'm at work so I can't try to log in to check that right now.  Work is slow

I was going to break this down into ""The good, which is really the only thing I'd put in the ""ugly"" category.  Instead I'll just talk about my perspective coming into the game and what I've gotten out of it so far.

First of all, the animations make or break a game.  I have, for instance, played Rift and feel like the characters are stunted, wooden puppets without much range of motion.  The attack animations in Rift (et al.) are boring and unimaginative to the point that, by level 10 you're really hoping for something new and not getting it.  In part I think this is one of the reasons why WoW was so successful, that their character animations had *weight*... *gravitas* if you will.  They might not have been extremely *realistic* but they looked good

The Old Republic is the same way.  I had been following the development of this game for several years,"" making me really dislike the class.  I'm pleased to say that your rifle follows the target in 2 axes and looks pretty bad ass when you're pumping rounds into a prone sith in a warzone (like [this guy on the left in particular](http://man-over-board.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/swat-cat.jpg)).

This is probably not as big a deal to a lot of people as it is to me.  It's not the quality of the graphical and textural rendering that matters as much to me as how the characters interact with their environment.  For SWtoR

Too, the starting zones are not any smaller than the biggest WoW zone and Coruscant (second planet you go to on Republic side) is so big that it's almost kind of annoying to have to run from one end of a sub-zone to the other (there are 5 subzones within Coruscant ... six maybe I can't remember off the top of my head).  And Taris, one of the planets you can go to after Coruscant, is just goddamned huge.  And freakin' beautiful.  Taris is so awesome looking its hard to describe.

As for game play, because they're all so good, STILL can't decide what I'll play as my main when this thing goes live.

One of the big things that is being screamed about in the forums is the change to the ""mod system"" that had been in the previous build.  Prior to the current build almost every piece of gear had ""slots"" (kind of like gem slots in WoW) and you could put various upgrades into those slots to improve the item.  The mods were either crafted by the various professions or looted from mobs/chests or as quest rewards.  The thing that people really liked was being able to find, and being able to keep it and scale it with your level by replacing it with better (level dependent) mods.   

The current build almost entirely struck the mod system by removing most slots on non-epic and lower-level gear.  There is still moddable gear

The fact is that it has been made known that the system is undergoing some changes and that modding will return in some compromised form in a later build.  It was clear (to me at least

As for other aspects of the game: 

1) There are just a shit ton of lightning-throwing Sith inquisitors in PvP.  It's just stupid out there honestly.  Way more diverse crowd on the Republic side.

2) Warzones are great

3) Voice acting is superb and it can't be stated enough: this changes the whole MMO experience.  I can say that listening to every moment of every conversation takes a whole lot of time and I don't mind one bit.

4) Some of the class specs are hard to define in terms of play style.  Just looking at the trees for, you have a mix of ranged and melee attacks which seems to lend itself to really dynamic play.  It's not like WoW where you do this one thing all the time (spam fireball, shoot bow, swing sword) but involves a mix of various kinds of abilities which, to be honest, is pretty cool.

5) Space combat is fun I think.  A lot of people have complained about BioWare not upping the ante by having a full 3-D free-roaming space shooter *on top* of this already massive game

That's about all I have for now.  I might be able to answer a few questions throughout the day if anyone wants to ask anything general.

This is my two cents on how the SWTOR economy will handle the slicing nerf.

Yes, VERY few people in this subreddit seem to grasp the fact that the SWTOR economy is about to seriously deflate.

Most people seem to be of the persuation that 

&gt; ""lol you n00bs that took slicing should just pick a different profession and sell your mats to make money like the rest of us DERP""

but what people aren't thinking about is that economics is rarely that simple.  Most people that were making an excellent living on crafted items were doing so because slicing was the ONLY way

Now that slicing is gone

The influx of currency in this game was cut by

That means prices

It's not the GTN that's the problem, right?

Wrong.

Exorbitantly prices skill training, players will be saving their money for those instead.  THIS is where the true problem lies.

At least if money is being spent in the GTN

With so little true expendable income in the game

This is why one of two things must happen in the near future:

1. Slicing gets buffed again

2. Skill training costs will be significantly lowered.  The only way for the games economy to properly survive after the slicing nerf if it remains unchanged is to lower the cost of skills to keep more credits in the SWTOR economy.

3. Vendor prices when selling items/quest rewards/pvp rewards will rise to raise the influx of cash into the economy.

Thoughts?

tl;dr - The slicing nerf ""ceteris paribus"" (there was a definite need for a nerf

You must finish your class story in your starter planet, which will direct you to your AC trainer.

**Q: Can I change my Advanced Class?**

There is currently no way to change your Advanced Class and Bioware said there might be a possibility to chance it once but do not take my word for it.

**Tip: Do not forget that you have to [switch tabs](http://i.imgur.com/QOygT.jpg) at the trainer to learn your Class skills and Advanced Class skills.**

**Q: Where can I learn Speeder Training?**

You can learn your Speeder Training at your class trainer.

**Q:When do I get my ship?**

Depending on how fast you do your class quests

**Q: What is the Fleet?**

Fleet is a place where you will find almost everything you want. Recommendation vendors for each planet,  Galactic Trade Network, VIP/CE Vendors, Speeder Vendors, Skill Mentor, Crew Skill trainers. Also almost every Flashpoint will be accessed from here. [Here's a map](http://i.imgur.com/mzv3l.jpg) to help you a little bit to show where you can find some vendors and important NPCs.

**Q: What is Legacy and how can I get a Legacy name?**

Legacy is a system Bioware implemented which will help your character and your alts in the same server as you progress. At the moment you can only get a legacy name which will be shared with all the characters in your server (Empire or Republic). But Bioware is planning on Legacy perks like XP boost for alts and additional Races (not final)

Legacy will be enabled when you finish Act I on a character (which is usually after Alderaan around level 30-33).

You can choose to show your Legacy name in 2 ways; (for sake of example your name is Luke and your legacy name is Skywalker

You can choose it to look like a Last name

Another way is to show it like a Title

**Q: What are crew skills and how do they work.**

There are 3 types of Crew Skills and you can have one of each;

Gathering

Crafting will require mats you get from Mission and Gathering crew skills. For the relation between them you can look at this [picture.](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6449479755_882a07fb9c_b.jpg)

For more information like basics

**Q:How can I get more recipes?**

Your Crafting Crew Trainer will teach you more items as you level that skill. Some Gathering missions will also randomly give you some crafting recipes.

**Q: What are Flashpoints?**

Flashpoints are 4 man Dungeons(for those that are not familiar with WoW/MMOs

The very first Flashpoint you will encounter is Esseles/Black Talon (For Republic and Empire respectively). You will be able to do this flashpoint when you finish your starter planet and go to your Fleet.

**Q: How can I PvP and what is a Warzone?**

There are 2 ways to PvP. You can either do World PvP

There are currently 3 types of Warzones and you can only queue Random and not a specific one. These are;

Huttball: Somewhat a CTF but there is only 1 flag (The ball) and the objective is to take the ball to behind the enemy line (Which is on their end).

The Civil War/Alderaan: This is more like a capture the base/Arathi Basin. This map has 3 points that you can capture. There are 2 side bases and one in the middle. Capturing bases will start reducing points from enemy


**Tip: If you hold a side base

The Voidstar: This can be compared to Strand of the Ancients. This is a 2 part game, reach the final node. Defenders objective is to prevent the enemy team reaching the final node by not allowing them to plant bombs or defusing them. If one team manages to reach the node and other one doesn't, the one that reaches wins.

If both teams manage to reach the node

If both teams do not manage to reach the node

Tips: 

* You can press space to skip the dialogue

* If you chose the wrong option during a dialogue (such as darkside/lightside or companion affection) You can press ESC button to cancel the whole dialogue and start from beginning.

*Mousebutton 4 or Numlock is default for auto-walk.

*You can see if that dialogue option gives dark side or light side points by hovering over it.

*You can access the Fleet using your Fleet Pass. It's a General Skill,000CR. You can also access the Fleet from some locations on certain planets, which is a great shortcut from going all the way to the spaceport, going in your ship, flying to the Fleet etc...

*If you use Light Armour

**Preferences**:

There are a lot of nice options that people often do not notice and I will list them here.

Controls: You can choose to Auto-Loot on right click or Area Loot which will look the mobs in a certain area by looting 1 mob.

Chat: You can remove the annoying Profanity filter if you want and add timestamps.

User Interface: You can choose to show your/target health/resource in your health bar

Social: You can choose to hide your helmet if you find it hideous or you can hide your sith corruption if you want to be dark side but do not want to look like one. You can also choose how do you want to show your Legacy name or if you want to show it at all.

**Modifying:**

You no longer need a workbench to modify your items. A fully modifiable item will have an orange name like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iZOhO.jpg). You can open the modify window by ctrl+rightclick that item.

Item's will get their Quality depending on the Hilt/Armoring you put into them. You can use an orange item you received at level 10 and put level 50 mods into them

*[You can remove mods from your items](http://i.imgur.com/yz8x1.jpg) to and put them into another items. Just drag that mod into your bag and it will be removed if you agree to pay the credit.

1333723755.0,rwbds,So much WoW Syndrome in here...,digidevil4,478,332,539,"Ye this post is about World of Warcraft


WOW Syndrome has had a profound effect on pretty much any good MMOS ability to stay active for the past few years and its beginning to annoy me.


**What is WOW Syndrome I hear you ask in my head?**

* MMO gamers are by nature mostly monogamous


The reason Im writing about this in a SWTOR subreddit is because it is my strong belief that **90%** of all these people giving reason after reason for un-subbing are just WoW syndrome sufferers. I say strong belief... Im 100% sure thats the case


A game launches with the so called ""WoW killer"" title


Case in Point with Age of Conan:

* 1. Game launches to huge subscription base.
* 2. A month passes with very little change to population
* 3. WoW syndrome sets in
* 4. Players start leaving
* 5. Server Populations begin to drop
* 6. Second Wave of Wow syndrome sets in.
* 7. Server Populations drop further
* 8. Game declared dead by most WoW players.


Age of Conan isnt dead


We are now seeing similar patterns in SWTOR


1. Stop blaming game-play, or god knows what else. All of your reasons are just you trying to convince yourself that you need to go back to WoW. All your doing by complaining is giving other WoW Syndromers justification to complain more. Its only natural you want to return to a game were you are more comfortable, just be honest about it.


2. Please stop spamming the forums and reddit with reasons why the game isnt good enough for you. Noone cares..


Plain and simple fact: WoW got here first



Anyway Id write more but I Feel that this will be downvoted to hell anyway. Please leave comments below



For any mature people our there who want to discuss this it would be nice for WOW players to tag themselves somehow.  


EDIT:

So many People here are just replying with the same things.
To all those people who Im going to stop commenting to individually please read this:

* 1. I am not saying everyone who quits
* 2. I am not saying everyone who has ever played WoW has WoW Syndrome.
* 3. I am not saying that the game has no issues.


**Read this:**
**""Most WoW players subconsciously want to return to WoW

Right.. that is my point.

The problem this presents is it kills my movement key bindings at *WASD*. When I say prefer

I really want to love this game. I have hundreds of hours logged on both KotOR games and love the entire Star Wars universe. I want to play the game for the story and to support Bioware in their Star Wars game ventures - I had been dreaming about TOR since 2004.

I have even contemplated buying a second mouse with a keypad on the side and play *WASD* and cast off the side of the mouse. It would take me some time to save for one - if I did chose to go down that route I would want to splurge and get a good quality one. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So does /r/swtor have any creative methods of keybinding so I can get everything down (I would stick to playing through the story and PVE) off *1 through =* in a manageable way without killing *WASD* or at least killing *1 through =* and providing an alternative to *WASD*? 


I have tried just moving with the mouse but that way I cannot move and cast or kite properly. I would resort to buying a new mouse like I said but only as a last resort as I have a great  one (Razer DeathAdder) already. Are other peripherals an option? I have two keyboards

Thanks for getting through the word wall any help would be appreciated. 


EDIT: Thanks for the responses everybody! I checked out the link supplied by /u/geraz and rebound movement as suggested by /u/Parrk and rebound everything in a similar shape to what noxxic.com had suggested. I haven't had the chance to play as of yet but I look forward to spending some quality time with the game as the weekend rolls in.

I did consider going for having movement just on the mouse but it felt too limited and I seem to always need to back peddle  with my Trooper (I don't know if I am doing it right).

There are only 44 PVP/RP-PVP servers so the data collection took a bit shorter, the voidstar etc"" - this gave much lower numbers (at first I thought it was cuz the players on PvP servers  are less ""lazy"" and don't sit around on the fleet as much hehe). I had to erase all the data and start over. 


7 planets and 3 warzones + fleet were used. Warzone data is a bit weird sometimes as people enter/exit warzones constantly and the 30secs-1 minute time I need to switch characters can cause some odd (uneven) ratios. But as suspected - Imperial players play alot more Huttball (the pit) than Republic players.


Sadly

I just want to emphasize it again that this is cross-sectional/(snapsnot in time) population data and it is a *representation* of the actual population data. This is what anyone who wanted to go around servers making level 1 characters would have observed when he/she types in stuff in the who-list during prime time (6:30 pm-10:00 pm EST for east coast and 6:30 pm-10:00 pm PST for west coast).

Like many of you I bought the game at launch, and ended up subscribing for an additional 2 months. Towards the end of the 3rd month, before the Legacy patch, I felt like it was becoming too boring. I didn't feel like making more than the 2 characters I already had, and I had a small backlog of other games I wanted to play, so I unsubbed and thought that was that. 

A couple of days ago, what the hell! I'll take the free week. And I've got to admit, I thought I was done with this game completely, and it would just die a quiet death in a couple of months. I was wrong. **This game has increased immensely in quality since launch**. Between the free server transfers, optimizations to the Hero Engine (which is desperately needed), new features, the legacy system, and new a new planet \ quest hub

However an increasingly common trend I'm seeing is people quitting WZ as soon as things aren't going their way and it's getting ridiculous. I can't count how many times I'll be in Alderaan and have 2-3 people leave if we don't get 2 caps in the beginning, so why not? Problem is they screw over the rest of the team. Maybe it was a losing battle, but having half your team quit certainly doesn't help.

If I had my way, if that meant everyone else would think twice before leaving at the first sign of losing.

1365445513.0,1bxkyj,Starting out in Rise of the Hutt Cartel - a guide,dulfy,158,17,53,"Hey everyone

**Prelaunch preparation**

* Stock up on experience boosts – major or minor. These boosts (25% experience bonus) will give you about 0.5 to 0.75 of a level more. Three major (lasts 9 hrs) should be plenty. 

* It is not a bad idea to do some dallies/weeklies and then turn them in once the servers are up. If all goes well

* Gear up/Respec – Black Hole/Campaign gear will be fine for Makeb content. Dread Guard is more than enough. If you are still in Rakata/Columi you might have some trouble later on. Healers have an easier time but kills a bit slower. AoE specs are great as Makeb mobs often come in large groups. 


* Get rid of extra comms
    
    Planetary commendation cap: 100 (this includes the one time overflow limit). 100 planetary commendations will allow you to buy some L52 mods on Makeb. Remember that Tionese cystals will also get converted to planetary comms at a ratio of 2:1 (2 crystals for 1 comm). 

    Classic Commendation cap: 800 (this includes the one time overflow limit). If you have lots of Black Hole commendations


* Form premade groups with friends – questing is a lot faster with other players. 

**Makeb**

* Unless they changed this from the beta, STAGED weeklies) to get you to the level cap. However, if you are severely undergeared, killing L55 mobs at L53 isn't really fun. Hence, doing some pre-patch preparation may come in handy here. 

* I have [a guide here of most of the Makeb missions](http://dulfy.net/2013/04/07/swtor-makeb-mission-guide/) on the Empire and Republic side. Most of the missions are fairly self-explanatory but what you may find helpful are spawn maps I made of various mission objectives. From past experience on launch day

* Datacrons: There are two on Makeb +10 Endurance (hard) and +10 presence (easy). Don't waste your time getting them pre-55 as they can take quite a bit of time. Presence one will probably take you 5-10 minutes but endurance one can take much longer. 

    +10 presence: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYQ_HzJz_mU

    +10 endurance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGxtVzRqXaw

**Macrobinoculars and Seeker Droids**

* Seeker Droids and Macrobinoular questline can be started at L52 but it is not advised to not to do them until you are finished with the Makeb storyline as they take a huge amount of time to do and it can be inefficient if you are looking to level to 55. 

    On the Empire side

    On the Republic side

* Some of the macrobinocular and seeker droid missions are fairly straightforward (i.e. go to location x

* Make sure to do the macrobinocular and seeker droid story missions together as they require you to travel to the same planets. 

**GSI dallies**

* You can start them as soon as you head to Dromund Kaas/Coruscant to pick up your seeker droids and macrobinoculars for the initial steps of the seeker dorid/macrobinocular chain. Makeb GSI dallies are really easy to do and give a good source of XP on your way to L55. I wouldn't bother with the other zones

* Here is a [guide to the GSI dallies on the four areas](http://dulfy.net/2013/03/26/swtor-gsi-mission-dailies-guide/)

**Gearing up at 55**

* Dread Guard gear is sufficient to clear hardmode L55 flashpoints and storymode L55 operations (TFB and S&amp;V). 

* Running the four L55 hardmode flashpoints (Athiss, and Mandalorian Raiders) will give you random Black Market pieces which have no set bonus but can be stripped for mods and enhancements.
* Running storymode TFB and Scum and Villainy will grant you most of the Arkanian pieces. 
* Running hardmode TFB and Scum and Villainy will grant you Underworld pieces. 
* Basic Commendations can be used to purchase Arkanian relics and some gear slightly better than the Dread Guard stuff.
* Elite Commendations can be used to purchase Black Market pieces (no set bonus)
* Ultimate Commendations can be used to purchase Verpine pieces (no set bonus). 
* Here is a [loot table for operations drops in 2.0](http://dulfy.net/2013/04/08/swtor-patch-2-0-operation-loot-tables/).

1329512356.0,pudg8,"Huttball scores, Turret captures, and Door plants should earn MEDALS in PVP. Give people a reason to fight for the WIN!",Cohh,196,80

A) You either join a warzone to get Win for your daily (Valor 60+s

B) You are actively farming Warzone commendations for your Purple Champion Bags.

When A's play together, usually have 6-0 in the first few minutes of a Huttball round (As they should).

However...

Put those two together, grow WF participation, and greatly improve the current stereotypes associated with SW Warfront PVP.

Suggestions for Huttball:

- Every point needs to be a medal, they deserve it.

- Passes need to be tracked (completed vs failed). I originally theorized about suggesting a medal for completed passes, anything that encourages people to pass the ball would be great a step to encourage this type of team-oriented behavior.

- Fix. Resolve. Please. :)


Suggestions for Voidstar:

- Planting a bomb gives one medal. This can only happen on the first plant per door.

- Diffusing a bomb would be tracked, is encouraging to those who give up on medals to help the team win)


Suggestions for Civil War:

- Taking a turret initially would give a medal. The medal, which I do not have access to), and only at the time of capturing.

- Turret Defender medal: Accruing at least 1k defense at all turrets


General Warzone Suggestions:

- Planet-side nailed the marking system. Just copy this system; allow the raid leader to place ""Marks"" on the map. Allow them to generate waypoints with the big ""loot light"" of a unique color that everyone can see. 

- MVP Titles: Should have some titles based on being MVP (1 vote, 7 votes). 

- See my previous thread on MVP/Social suggestions (more great suggestions in the comments): http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/pu67a/bioware_warzone_mvp_votes_should_give_the_voter/


Basically, driven portion of the player-base is currently being shafted by the ones who want to do their own thing because there is no incentive for them to do otherwise. Basically, the two goals need to be aligned; personal gain AND team gain should be synonymous in the eyes of the player.

1374175165.0,1ikui8,Low level FP strategies,Mazzanti,148,13,27,"This is a post about all the flashpoints up until Cademimu. It includes useful tips to all new players I have learned over playing all types of classes up to at least level 29.

Black Talon / Essles

This is so easy it requires almost zero tips

Hammer Station

All the fights are quite easy to run through with a mediocre group, healers go first in almost every case, if you would like to provide an instance where you don't, go ahead, I don't expect this to be perfect. The last boss however is where I see many tanks screw it up and cause a wipe because of one ability: Sweeping Gunfire. Tanks need to force him to face the computer at the start, with DPS and healer on the sides. When he channels Sweeping Gunfire, charge him and run straight through him

Athiss

The first boss encounter is easy. The only tip I can offer is to have one DPS specifically target adds throughout the entire FP, because its a low level FP, therefore new players or entitled tanks and healers. The most effective thing I have seen done is running into the temple behind the Beast of Vodal and the tank getting in the right wall / back wall corner, while the healer sits as far from the tank as possible. When the Beast spawns its babies, DPS burn them down before it can even reach healer, with DPS still outside by the entrance, as that's the back of the boss to prevent being thrown as well and it is also where the adds spawn. The final encounter is easy. Watch for Soul Rend debuff. If you have it, run. Healer has to focus on those targeted by the boss's DoT. Later in the fight the Prophet will use a CC which drains health

Mandalorian Raiders

All tanks should not open with their AoE in the start of trash mobs. Jump in and let them get close, because after doing such, he will reset aggro, which is why you need to taunt him back in. The second encounter is a high step up. I have seen everyone get in a corner by the large stairs, focusing on the Warrior, then Inquisitor, then both to 10 percent, and take the hunter quickly. Agent will put out Corrosive dart and poison clouds

Cademimu 

This is a huge step up. Tanks need to use a large amount of AoE on pulls, so after a target is hard CC'd, pull them out so you can AoE. The first fight nobody should attack the droid, but run when you are ""under arrest"". If you are under arrest, lead the droid into a large orange circle on the ground which will trap him. Don't step in it yourself. Healers watch those under arrest and cleanse ""electro net"" debuff, which slows the recipient down. The second boss is easy, be sure to save AoE for the ugnaughts. Also, try to use that to advantage. If you can't hold the ugnaughts down

If you have more to add

1333748426.0,rwy4u,My WoW experience and how it makes me appreciate SWTOR more.,delbin,212,79,107,"I started playing WoW back in 2005. I played an enhancement shaman almost the entire time until I stopped playing about a year ago. I've seen what started as a really terrible, specs

**First

Back in classic WoW, then wait for the cooldown to end. In a group my job was to cast a buff or two and keep it up. Our spec was shit. All shaman had to be healers if you were in a serious raid. There was no gear itemized for my class and my class sets were useless. Of course I didn't know any better and I was playing with my friends, so I got enough enjoyment out of it.

Burning crusade was such a boon for enhancement.  We went from buff bots to central DPS characters. Not only could we finally hold our own against other DPS classes, and I was rewarded for it. Our gear sets made sense for the first time. I'm definitely one of those that found Burning Crusade to be the best expansion WoW had.

Since Lich King, you might as well bring along another rogue or mage.

Through all this time, I was a terrible healer (healer is the pvp spec.) I found that with a lot of time and gear I could hold my own, but there was never a chance for me to be a high-level arena player. I only ever saw one enhancement shaman in the national finals and there was just about never one in the top 100 that I remember.

Blizzard never balanced for 1v1 combat and barely balanced for 2v2 combat. On the small scale it became a game of rock-paper-scissors-spock. I could kill priests, with equal gear, would almost always win in one-on-one combat. I still did battlegrounds, but it was just too frustrating to go into the arena.

**After a year or so without playing any MMOs I started SWTOR.**

The leveling experience was better.  There were still the kill 10 boars quests

Through all my leveling I PVP'd a lot. Unlike WoW, but I could hold my own. The level 12s were easier to kill, but they were still a threat if I let my guard down. I really feel I could play any spec in any class and have a place in the warzone. There was never one class or spec I felt would /always/ kill me or vice versa.

My server has a fairly low raiding population so it took some time to start operations. Once I did I was pretty satisfied with how they tuned the encounters. I felt like gear mattered

**Final thoughts.**

Looking back I found that SWTOR is much better for me at this point in my life. I have a full time job, but I can see getting frustrated with it if I tried to play every day. SW equalizes the playing field enough that you don't have to grind factions, badges, crafting, and dungeons to earn a place in a raid. With the first tier of epic gear you're ready to start raiding successfully. However, if you do spend some extra time, you'll notice a difference in your performance and you'll have an easier time.

If SWTOR came out during Burning Crusade I would have played it for a couple weeks and given up. I had a lot more time and it would have been much better for me to play a game that had limitless faction and token grinding, so hard just to stay competitive. It doesn't provide the 40-hours-a-week playing time that WoW could, but I simply don't need that anymore.",,False,self,t5_2qxih,,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/rwy4u/my_wow_experience_and_how_it_makes_me_appreciate/
1329754790.0,pxwp8,My list of what to do now that I hit 50.,jcyr,198,67,149,"Finally got around to hitting 50.  (Wolfgang Drogo - Dreshdae Cantina - Repub - Trooper)

Have really enjoyed the game so far. My leveling is mostly from questing and a bit of pvp.  I have seen a few threads about nothing to do once you hit 50.  Mostly on official forums.  *(shudder)*  

I have SO MUCH TO DO! Figured I would just write it all out and use it as a checklist for myself and perhaps others.

Please submit anything I may have missed. 

**Datacrons:** 

Find all of them. I managed to get them all up to Nar Shadaa and then just gave up on focusing on getting them on every planet before I left.  Yes I will even get the datacrons that don't really benefit me stat wise.  

I feel compelled to try to get each one without a guide.  Yes I will use a guide if I simply can't figure it out after hours.  But part of the fun and sense of accomplishment is figuring out the puzzle yourself.

Also need to put together my relic from the datacron shards.  I have only 1 of the 3 color combo's that I need for my lvl 50 relic.  Can I get two?

**Ilum PVP:**

I have yet to do anything here as I just hit 50.  I hear that on many servers it is hard to get Republic players to join in

**Ilum and Belsalvis Dailies:**

Something to do each day.  Have yet to do them

**Codex Achievements:**

Each planet shows the number of codex entries, map areas to discover, and titles.  Need to go back and check all of these off the list.  This is a massive undertaking.  So much to discover and find.  Like datacrons I want to do what I can without guides.

**Social Points:**

I did very little flashpoints or group questing.  I am WAY behind on my social points. 

There are SO MANY quests I haven't done.  Just had to skip them to keep up with my class quest.  Need to find a partner and go back and finish them for social points

**Flashpoints:** 

Related to above

**Space Combat:**

I love it.  But stopped playing when I focused on lvling around lvl 30.  I know, etc.  I hear that have fun things in store for us in this regard, and am looking forward to updates.

**Gearing Up:**

I have some pvp gear on from lvl 40 still

**Crew Affection/Gear:**

One of my crew members (healer) was with me almost he whole time.  She is maxed

**Crafting:**

I have hit 400 on cybertech

**Light Side Max:**

For this character I decided to go all light side.  I am lvl 3 or 4

**Try out Healing:**

I am considering a respec to combat medic for a while.  I see a need for healers in PVP.  Probably mean a second set of gear at some point.  Need to look into that.


**LVL Alts:**

I have a few alts now.  I really enjoy all of them, one going true neutral, another dark, etc.

**Collect Stuff:**

I am a collector.  Vehicles, but I have made a small dent so far.  A cool mount on tattooine in the pvp area, btw.

**Outfits for Companions:**

I have this silly idea that I should outfit my healer companion in a fancy dress.  So need to mod the hell out of it.  Others may just wear some other fun outfits.

**Work on Guild**

I have a small guild.  Casual.  Friends and Family plus cool people we meet on the way.  Still there is only 5 max online at a time.  Would like to have more activity and vibrancy there from nice

**Legacy LVL:**

Not sure you can work on this really.  As long as I am active and doing things other then crafting it goes up.  LVL 6 so far.  I am guessing it will be useful starting next month.  Guessing we get a new race playable.  Voss?  Need to leave some alt slots free.

**Events:**

Organize some sort of event at Outlwas Den.  Guild vs Guild maybe?

**World Bosses:**

Killed a couple so far.  But not all.  This is a list that must be completed.  Maybe form a group then travel from planet to planet in order. 

EDIT: Add new items.

**Max Valor**

See suggestions below.

**Collect Orange Equipment**

The suggestion below for helms is a fun one.  I rather like the bubble one from the space combat rewards.

**Space for other stuff:** :-)

It appears a lot of people appreciated this so I figured I might as well show this to more people in the hopes of it proving useful to them or for their fellow gaming acquaintances.**


**EDIT** - I chose WoW for my comparison because it is the MMO that I am still most familiar with and because it has the Highest likelihood of potential in helping people getting a grasp of this game before release.  If you or someone you know are knowledgeable about another MMO and would like to make a similar post



Here are some brief descriptions of each AC and how they function in comparison to WoW.  Just remember, there's better info out there but this could help some Ex/Current WoW players choose which class they'd like to start with until they become more familiar with the game.

1335114646.0,smsv4,Ever wondered how to calculate amount of affection a gift give or how/when convos with your companions are triggered?,dulfy,156,31,27,"Hey everyone

&gt;**Calculating Companion gift affections**

Many of you have probably seen a chart like this that list all the affection a certain gift will give. http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/giftaffections.jpg

Have you ever wondered how that is calculated?

If you are curious

It is simply (gift rank - companion affection rank) * type of gift (green, like, favourite, love)

**Rank Difference**

There are 5 ranks of companion affection and 5 ranks of companion gifts

Rank 1: -1000 to 1999
Rank 2: 2000 to 3999
Rank 3: 4000 to 5999
Rank 4: 6000 to 7999
Rank 5: 8000 to 10000

The number generated when you do companion gift rank - companion affection rank is the one you want. For example

Rank Difference	Modifier

-4	0

-3	0

-2	0.2

-1	0.5

0	1

1	1.1

2	1.3

3	1.5

4	1.5

**Type of Gift**

There are 3 ""tiers"" of gifts (for now

Green - Premium

Each give you a different modifier

Green = 6

Blue = 10

Purple = 24

**Likeness**

Companions have 4 types of likeness to every gift = indifferent, love

Each likeness have a modifier

Indifferent = 0

Like = 4

Favourite = 9

Love = 16

For example, and gave him a green rank 1 Technology gift the resulting affection would be 6 x 1 x 9 = 54.

* Gift rank – companion affection rank = 0

* Green gift (premium)

* Technology (favourite)


&gt;**Companion conversion triggers**

Conversations with your companions are triggered by your affection with them. Some companions are extremely chatty (i.e. Quinn) and have alot of triggers. Other companions like Xalek are super quiet and have fewer triggers. 

Using this chart here

Empire: http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/empireconvotriggers.jpg

Republic: http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/republicconvotriggers.jpg

&gt;**The Rest**

I have updated the companion gift list for 1.2, romancing them will change their likeness towards several types of gifts). Keep in mind that these romances for now are opposite sex only.

I also added the ship droid crafting bonuses along with crafting bonuses for rest of the companions!

So please, when you enter a Warzone, turn off your title and either turn off or convert to legacy bar your legacy last name. It makes it much easier to heal you in times of crisis.

After completing some space dailies today

While still on the ship

The gamebreaking part is that this does not allow you to accept any new quests. More importantly

**My character right now is a level 27 paperweight who can do nothing but run space missions

There appears to be some issues with certain quests not playing well with the pending quest feature. 

Personally my first issue with not being able to accept pending rewards started with finishing very last Sith Inquisitor quest on Balmorra by speaking to Major Bessiker. My inventory was full, but clicking on the pending reward button opens nothing, and you're stuck with 1 pending quest, but are still able to go on.

If you have a similar issue. BE VERY CAREFUL when you go to do your space dailies. I would suggest not even doing them at all until this issue is resolved. 

Additionally I'd honestly suggest not trusting the pending quest system at all right now and always making sure your inventory has room for rewards.

I hope this helps some folks. If you are having this issue

* **Fake items** don't show up in the database
* **If you search for a mod**
* **Crafted items** have all of the variants with correct stats. [See an example](http://swtor.askmrrobot.com/gear/4465/biorestorative-belt).
* **Random items** have all of their variants listed (the first database to have this info!). See an example with [Electrotex bindings](http://swtor.askmrrobot.com/gear/280/prototype-electrotex-bindings)
* **3rd party API** coming in the next couple of weeks: we want to share this data with people who make tools, drop me a note!

**What's missing?**

* Some sources aren't fleshed out
* Right now
* Ship items are not in the database yet.
* Comments. We're adding in a commenting system in the next couple of weeks.
* Tooltips for bloggers: also coming very soon
* Mobile app - that's right

1324053712.0,nfaxr,The problems &amp; corrections the SWTOR team did to give us an mmo that rocks.,joestriker,173,49,66,"Looking back from day 1 to now

Problems as of Dec 7th:
* No grace period
* Late shipping on vendors (amazon
* No security apps for iOS or Android

Corrections since the 7th:
* Grace period for 48 hours for all sales
* Vendors are shipping/ have shipped product prior to release date
* iOS has an app now; Android will have an app in the next few days

Pre-release has been simply awesome - Not only did it let us get into the full game days before launch
* allow players to start up on different days
* The Pre-launch guild allows you to get with your friends faster and coordinate alts and new members easier into the system

I know without a doubt that the coming weeks will show us more support and make the changes to this MMO
