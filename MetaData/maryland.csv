Personally, but here in Maryland we have a very important ballot initiative, Question 6:

&gt; Establishes that Maryland’s civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license, or benefits to an individual related to the celebration or promotion of marriage in violation of their religious beliefs.

This is a chance to make a serious difference for the better and fix a long-standing wrong.

Voting ""yes"" for Gay Marriage is a win-win scenario - The language specifically protects the religious rights of churches to apply their own standards, while other churches get legal recognition for their gay congregants' marriages that their straight congregants' marriages already have.

IMHO

Time is running out to register to Vote. Similar initiatives have always failed to produce the right outcome, and get it right).",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,1348533769.0,,

Well I got my first letter and bill from them today

This came as a major shock since I had not received a first bill for which I could delay payment for 30 days and then receive the bill with late fees.

So I call up EZPass and they put me on hold for 15 minutes and then I talk to some lady and tell her this is the first bill I've received

Later I talked to my dad who also sometimes uses the ICC and he said he got a huge bill from them with the same admin fees. Same story

I also spoke to my friend's dad and he ALSO had the same thing happen where he got a huge bill with admin fees and no first bill. 

All 3 of us have different addresses and vehicle registrations. While I and my dad don't have accounts

I looked it up and there are lots of reports about it happening in New Jersey

I want to contact whoever I can to get this brought to light and see where it goes from there. So if you have a story or know someone who has had this happen

During the initial installation process, it did not meet state compliance. 



So, validated the concern and then made a decision to turn off all speed cameras so that we can review the entire program - from top to bottom - to make sure everything is in compliance. Here are some questions and answers that might help you: 



•	What camera sites are affected? Only one: The westbound side of Berry Road at Jenifer Elementary School. 

•	Are we fixing the issue? Yes. 

•	Will you get a refund if you already paid a citation from the westbound Berry Road site? Yes. 

•	How long will that take? We’re not sure

•	What do I do if I received a citation from the westbound Berry Road site but haven’t yet paid it? Don’t pay it. If you verify that your citation is indeed from that site (the location is clearly marked on the citation)

•	Please note: All other fines from any other speed enforcement site should be paid. 

•	Are there still speed cameras on the roads? No

•	Are we looking at the compliance of other pad sites? Yes

•	What about Wade Elementary? It’s in compliance…but we’re working with the county to make it less confusing with all the lights.

•	I still have questions, from 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. (except holidays), our staff can be reached at (301) 609-5971 or (301) 609-5972. 



Now, it’s about equal. 



Often we hear the cameras were put in place to “make money.” Sadly



Prior to the cameras, staff, and even kids. Colonel Joseph Montminy, now a retired CCSO commander, did a lot of research about speed cameras and determined automated cameras would be the best way to reduce speeding in school zones. 



We set the program up, we even went so far as to make public the location of the cameras every week on the Agency facebook page. 



Folks, all of us will eventually get in the mindset that we are entering a school zone and we better slow down. 



In the meantime, please drive gently.""

&gt;Establishes the boundaries for the State's eight United States Congressional Districts based on recent census figures

At first glance

It's worth noting that while the US Constitution requires a census be taken to allocate an appropriate number of representatives per state in the House of Representatives, the actual issue is the way the various counties of Maryland are divided. Both the old and new maps can be found [here](http://planning.maryland.gov/Redistricting/redistrictingIMap.shtml). Rather than making the divisons between districts simpler and more sensical, the new boundaries make them even worse. Parts of the primarily Republican Washington and Frederick counties are mixed in with Democratic Montgomery County, and District 3 is even more of a mess than it was before (one of the most convoluted districts in the nation, according to [one report](http://marylandreporter.com/2012/10/03/maryland-has-least-compact-congressional-districts-in-nation/)). From what I've seen, informed persons from [both parties](http://marylandreporter.com/2012/10/15/montgomery-county-democrats-organize-opposition-against-congressional-districts/) are against this redistricting as it splits communities in an unnecessary manner and damages the voting power of Maryland citizens, but I want to make sure people know what this question actually is about, 6

I noticed on my settlement that the entire transfer tax was being charged to me.  It was not split 50/50.  I was told that Fannie Mae was exempt from paying it.  I accepted it at first, only 3 days before closing, I decided to call the Title company to ask about it.

It turns out that even if Fannie is exempt

EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS HONEST HELPFUL RESPONSE.  YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

EDIT 2: Some info from my comment below:

I'm a digital marketing manager for DBED's Office of Tourism.

Our official website is visitmaryland.org - NOTE: This site was developed before I started working for Tourism (it is 4+ years old) - I am constantly battling to move it forward.

I have subscribed to this subreddit for a while and I think you all have good ideas and topics of discussion.

I don't think any other states use reddit's awesome ideas

Another note - Tourism is HUGELY important in our state - it is the 4th largest employer in the state with over 130

Looking forward to your involvement!

When I attempted to explore playing the same in a more formal competitive setting I ran into a few snags. 

When trying to register for a amateur Starcraft 2 tournament with MLG (largest provider of professional gaming in the US)
http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/

I soon realized that all of the available tournaments that i could register with had this clause in the rules section.

""Eligible for US Residents only. Not valid in Arizona, North Dakota, and Vermont.""
http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/tournament/bronzesilvergold-hots-rumble/rules

I wondered to myself what about me living in Maryland possibly have to do with me not being able to participate in a free and casual online video game tournament that had no money involved. 

By chatting with a member of the support team for the tournament I was informed that Maryland did indeed have laws that conflicted with with the nature how how these tournaments were run.

After further research I realized that even though the tournament didn't cost money to enter
https://support.majorleaguegaming.com/customer/portal/articles/187370-what-are-credits-what-is-the-cost-

By now I have deduced that not only can these 'MLG credits' not only be obtained by winning tournaments

And even though these online credits are only used virtually

Upon further investigation I realized that by any interpretation of Maryland's gambling laws these MLG credits would be considered 'Gambling tokens'
http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/Maryland/

And since gambling on skill events (fighting/sports) is illegal. Then gambling these virtual 'Gambling tokens' based off of your Starcraft 2 skill must also be illegal. 

ACTUAL POINT:

I am very frustrated that my simple recreational activities are thwarted by state law in this way. I don't think people being effected as I have was the intention of any of the gambling laws, something can be changed slightly to allow for us friendly computer geeks to casually compete online in this way without having to lie about what state we live in.

P.S.

Regardless of the problem I am having

My family has suffered a lot of turmoil over the years because one of my siblings had to get serious surgery as a baby to survive (and a few more surgeries continuing into his youth).  Medical bills were astronomical.. actually, etc.  I'm sure you all heard of ""pre-existing condition"" in insurance, well.. my mom could then never quit HER job, because no insurance companies would cover my sibling because of all of his medical problems.  Talk about a dilemma.  Other family crises occurred and my dad always had  to be the one to help out, because my mother couldn't quit her job, she had the benefits.  My dad finally had a great job in home improvement but when 9/11 happened he was laid off.  He does not have a college degree, even though I personally think he is a brilliant man, and reliable, and doesn't have the time to compile and send out his bills while doing current work.  It is very hard for my parents to make ends meet bill-wise.  Now that I and my siblings are older

As a 22 year old, I am afraid we are going to lose our house.  This scares the living crap out of me.

I've tried really hard to help them as much as I could.  I have been working on my own company out of my basement and I am now making more than I ever had in a real job.  On top of trying to pay off my $100

I finally was able to get in touch with some debt collectors today,000 tools and personally hand write all his bills.  Literally, any job where he is paid a wage and issued a paycheck is better at this point.  He just needs some uniformity in his life.  I think that will alleviate their financial distress and I also plan on working with some financial advisers to get them set up on a monthly affordable budget.   It also makes me want to cry to think that my parents are nearing retirement age and are about to lose their only home.  They are good people that just are too in over their head. I'm sure many other people are in the same crisis right now, and I feel for you and am right there with you.  But I have no idea what to do.  I am calling a foreclosure lawyer tomorrow and also meeting with a bank to try and get a loan to help them, but I am just so scared about this uncertainty.

So a few things to close this up:
1.  If ANYONE out there is hiring
2.  If any of you could help me figure out where to get a loan
3.  Has anyone been foreclosed upon?  What are some things I should do?  Should I call the attorney?

Tuesday

Senator Shank

My name is Steve Shives. I’m 31 years old. I’m a constituent of yours from Sharpsburg. My wife and I have lived here for the last six years. Before that I lived in Hagerstown, unaffiliated. I’m an atheist. And I’m a lifelong resident of Washington County, as are both my parents, as were both sets of grandparents.

There are two more things you should know before I go any further. First, the Civil Marriage Protection Act. You’ve made no secret of your opposition to same-sex marriage in the past. Nevertheless, I would be derelict in my duties as a citizen if I didn’t at least attempt to change your mind. So here goes nothing.

Your current position on the issue of same-sex marriage would compel you to vote against SB 241. You would vote to continue to deprive our gay fellow Marylanders of the right to have their unions legally recognized by the state and to enjoy the benefits that come with such a recognition — benefits that you and I and all of our fellow straight Marylanders have taken for granted for generations. But consider whose interests you would be voting against. Gay Marylanders? Yes. But it’s more complex than that.

Vote against SB 241 and you’re also voting against the interests of men and women who, Don’t Tell” policy — and long before the institution of that policy in the 1990s — gay Americans have served in our nation’s Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard. Despite the hostility with which the majority of our society has treated them, despite the fact that they have been deprived of basic rights and privileges of citizenship for most of American history, millions of our gay fellow Americans have chosen to put their lives on the line, to defend the United States. Because until very recently their sexual orientation had to be kept a closely guarded secret

Cast your vote against SB 241 and you’ll be voting against the interests of many of your fellow Christians. There are millions of gay Americans who identify themselves as Christians. Some of them are open about their sexuality and attend churches that welcome and value them as the people they are, teach Sunday school classes and pray earnestly to the God they believe in, just the same as you. Despite the long-standing and ongoing animosity toward their orientation nursed by many members and leaders of the various denominations of their faith, gay Christians find the same things to value in their religion as I would imagine you do, Senator: love, charity, and forgiveness

Yes, of course. But please be aware of what I’ve just told you. There is no gated wall separating the gay community from the rest of our state. The gay community is a part of our community, just the same as Maryland is a part of the United States, and you and I, as a conservative and a liberal, respectively, are a part of the larger communities of Marylanders, and humanity. Vote against allowing same-sex couples to enjoy the rights and privileges that come with a civil marriage and you are voting against men and women who have served in our military, and served in our governments

Senator, the Civil Marriage Protection Act. I am asking this of you, even though I know it to be incongruent with your personal beliefs, because it is the just thing to do. It is the right thing to do.

I am not asking you to change your opinion on homosexuality. I am not asking your church to change its opinion on homosexuality. I am not advocating for the limit of free speech. I am not asking you to vote for a bill that would outlaw homophobia. Guaranteeing a right — the right to legally marry the partner of your choice — to a group of people who have long been denied it does nothing to harm those who have always enjoyed the right.

By voting for SB 241 you are harming no one. The rights of those who oppose gay equality in general and same-sex marriage in particular will not be infringed upon in the least. They, the gay citizens of this state will enjoy a measure of equal protection under the law that they have never known. They will be able to live their lives as they see fit, to conduct themselves as consenting adults according to their own consciences. This is no more than any citizen of a free country should expect. But no citizen of any free country should be expected to settle for any less.

If you’ve read this far, and I appreciate you taking the time to hear me out. This is an important issue to me. I feel strongly that now is the time to take this necessary and long overdue step, to afford our gay fellow Marylanders the same rights and privileges that we straight Marylanders have always enjoyed. This is the right thing to do, Senator Shank. I hope you will be courageous enough to see beyond your own position and the narrow demands of your own political base, and do it.

Thanks again for your time.

Sincerely

Steve Shives

Fat Tuesday is Feb. 21st this year and I would like to drive down there the Friday before (17th) right after work and start the return the Saturday after. 

Well...naturally there will be some things I need; Qualifications if you will. 

* Must know or have a willingness to learn stick. I will more than likely drive the whole way but something may end up happening and I need the assurance that everyone in the car can at least figure out how to drive it.  


*  Everyone will have to meet up before hand to ensure we get along...We will be spending a week together as well as 19 hours in a car both ways. 

*  If we fill the car the gas money comes out to roughly $70. Housing once in NOLA will be covered but you will need to help with food as well. 

*  Must be 21 or over. I was on Bourbon street drunk out of my mind when I was 14 but I don't want to have to deal with someone who is un-able to attend events at certain bars or festivities. 

*  Please remember this is at the core a visit for me to my family. I see them once a year (usually) and we will be staying in their homes. Though I suppose if you decided to you could get a hotel

*  This offer can be revoked at any time for any reason but I am an honest guy and if I find someone and tell them they can go

HE IS THE SNUGGLIEST DOG EVER. :-)

If you want the kind of dog who sticks to you like Velcro and wants nothing more than to be by your side getting pets and scritches

He loves to run around in our fenced backyard but is just as happy snuggled on the couch with a human.

Of course

Boo Boo's big downside (for some folks) is that he is convinced that young children are the spawn of Satan. We're not sure what he experienced in his younger years to cement this belief

My two cats have holed up in the guest bedroom since Boo Boo thinks they are fun for chasing.

He is fine with my dog (female, so you'll have time to test drive Boo Boo and see how he does in your home. :-)

In January I noticed my gas heat was not working very well in the house we recently moved into. I contacted a few HVAC services for a quote and chose Capitol Air Care. They came in and did an excellent job. There was a hole in an intake vent that was sucking in insulation which they quickly found and repaired. They cleaned the system from top to bottom. I gave the service men a credit card and signed the service paperwork. The problem I have is with their billing dept, ‘please call as soon as possible. Ty.’ I call that number back and I recognize the voice of the woman who works the office for Capitol Air Care. She tells me I need to give her a credit card right now as I owe them the 750, very rude and unprofessional in my opinion. I tell her I don’t have that kind of money on a Friday night and I need to check the bank records on my end to make sure her claim is correct. The credit card I used in January had been paid off and cancelled so I had to call them and track down the old statement. After finding out they did indeed only charge me the 7.50, I called back to talk to the woman. I told her that I had confirmed the under charge but I was very dissatisfied with her customer service. I asked why it took eight months to find the error and why the need to call and text me at 630 on a Friday. She said the audit came because the employee in charge of accounts was under investigation. Again, she outright demanded a credit card to pay off the balance. I told her that the mistake was not my fault, and I would have to shuffle some credit card balances around and I would call her back on Monday and hung up the phone.

I’m going to call back on Monday and pay her off

TL;DR Vendor dropped a decimal when charging my credit card and didn’t catch it for 8 month

First, being the Marylander and lover of blue crabs that I am, and am studying the Maryland ""culture"" of crab feasts and the creation of a ""Marylander identity"" that is centered around a shared tradition. I would LOVE some input as I am short on secondary sources that have been written about this topic. What I am asking you to do, if you can spare a few minutes, is write a short response or PM with the following information:

* 1) Some initials/pseudonym by which I can identify you in my paper (if none is indicated
* 2)Your age and how long you have lived in Maryland (or if you are no longer living in Maryland
* 3)Whereabouts you live in Maryland (I will accept county, Eastern Shore and so on, or a specific city if you feel comfortable enough)
* 4)What, is there such thing as a ""true"" Marylander?
* 5)Do you have any specific memories related to crab feasts/crabbing/etc? If so
* 6)In your opinion
* 7)If you moved to Maryland and were not raised here
* 8) Is there anything else you would like to add pertaining to this topic?

**EDIT: Per request

I will accept answers to all, if you do not wish for me to quote you in my paper please indicate so in your post. I am really interested in people who have moved to Maryland after being raised elsewhere not just those who have lived here their whole lives, as this will be where I will drive my points home.

Edit:  It is interesting the result this post has gotten.  It has enlightened me as to why Maryland school systems are considered some of the absolute worst for children on the spectrum and why Maryland still has no autism mandate when 34 states do have one.  

People in MD are completely clueless when it comes to autism and the need for early intervention (before the age of 2) and ABA therapy for children of all ages (and how lacking health insurance and the MD school system is when it comes to autism) unless they have a child on the spectrum...those with children on the spectrum cannot get the therapies their children need and end up paying out of pocket (or have to watch their child regress).  They then are faced an uphill battle because people are completely clueless about autism

It is not anyone's problem or concern (and you get wtf does a 2 year old need speech therapy, why would your child need ABA therapy if you cannot afford it, etc) until they are in the same situation.

Is it because they have to truck them inland farther?  I haven't found Giant much cheaper except on weekly sales items.


EDIT:  There seems to be some question about our sanity for moving here...well, I wish we'd known some of the things we know now before moving.  But some things you do not find out til you've lived someplace for a while.  There are some nice things about the area..I mean, only 30 minutes from a major city, but I can still go out and play in the woods. The light pollution is much lower here than in VB so I see the most beautiful stars at night.  My hopes are to have enough equity in our house to be able to move in about 10 years to DC.

The surgeons and therapists recommended inpatient rehab within 3 days after surgery.

James has major medical health insurance with United Health Care through his mother's job with a policy that includes inpatient rehabilitation. However, to go to rehab. UHC said he was appropriate to go to a nursing home, or go home from the hospital where we would have to do the best that we could on our own with possible home health services.

United Health Care has denied 4 appeals so far, felt it was too risky to take him to a nursing home where they are not qualified to care for a spinal cord patient, or to take him home where he may not recover or develop complications. UHC states it is up the family to appeal the denial. They have 30 days to respond. In the meantime, what was James supposed to do? James is required to pay his expenses out of pocket for the rehab. With that in mind, he may not be able to stay as long as he needs to gain his independence. He has been at Health South for two weeks now and is making gains daily with therapy.

I am asking that you report this to local and state government, it doesn't appear to be a mistake, but is a great injustice from the insurance company to save money.

James surgeons

Very Sincerely

**[EDIT]**
Some information about the dogs: One is a male Boston Terrier, about 3 months old; too young to be neutered but it is planned, working on housebreaking and starting to grasp basic commands but no leash training yet.  They are both very affectionate and good with people and they get along wonderfully together and with other pets (small pets like rodents may not be good because Bostons are instinctive ratters).  They tend to play hard and have a bit of a ""don't know their own strength"" roughness, so perhaps care with small children should be considered, but older kids would be great.  The Boston is willful and a bit an attention-hog but that's nothing abnormal for the breed and he isn't aggressive or territorial.  I understand the complications of the mix being unhousebroken at this point, but so far he has learned basic commands really well so anyone who's trained dogs before should have no problem.  Neither have any health issues or special dietary needs.

Now looking at recent maryland polls it goes 55% obama 37% Romney and due to the EC being winner take all it is almost certain that all 8 of our EC votes will go to Obama. But is sill waiver in my intension to vote for Stein.
Now i know Stein has no chance of winning but voting for her will help in future cycles to get the green party on ballots in every state(only in 80% states this election and that took enormous effort to achieve) and will get them more public funding next election.

 to Baltimore to include it in my new dancing video. This is an
 invitation to come out and join me.

 worry. I'm still not very good at dancing so you don't have to be
 perfect either. Just remember to smile and have fun.

 If I'm not Matt

 Before we dance
 the video. I'll shout some legal-sounding stuff on camera and you can
 just nod and give me a thumbs up if you're okay with it. Kids under
 18
 one of their thumbs to hold up (just kidding

 I can't guarantee the clip we shoot will end up in the final video.
 There will be a lot of footage to choose from and some of it will not
 be used.

 Wearing distinctive clothing will make it easier to spot yourself in
 the video
 Spider-Man
 everyone think you showed up naked or something. Also
 show up naked.

 After the event
 With Matt"" (so you'll have proof) and the book is about the travels
 that went into making the previous ""Where the Hell is Matt?"" videos.
 Everything is $15. Cash only
 items here:
http://store.wherethehellismatt.com/

 You're welcome to bring your own camera. After the shoot
 around for as long as anyone is waiting. I'm happy to dance with you
 in your own picture/video
 that you wait until we're finished shooting because I'll be very busy
 until then.

 If you can
 attend
 idea of how many dancers to expect. If you're not on Facebook
 worry about it. You're not missing anything.

 We're planning to put the final video up on the Internet before the end of 2011.

 I know a lot of you are nowhere near Baltimore. I can only put together
 so many of these events
 most emails and I try to invite people to the event that's closest to
 them. D.C. was in the last video
 city this time. I hope you can make it up.

 I will also be dancing in Philadelphia and Raleigh
 to go to one of those events

Want Matt to Come Dance With Your Group?
 I'm trying to include all sorts of dances with all kinds of groups
 this time
 is willing to meet up and perform with me
 and I'll see if I can fit it into the schedule. I may not be able to
 set something up on this visit
 but if it's a really great opportunity I may try to get in touch with
 you later on.

 Please understand
 schedule won't allow me to meet up with

1361979719.0,19bxlw,Maryland discriminates against atheists (and polytheists) within its state constitution.,eldrichgaiman,11,5,3,"Ignoring the reference to ""Almighty God"" in the Preamble...

From the **Declaration of Rights** from the current **Constitution of Maryland** (below emphasis mine):
&gt; Art. 36. That as **it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him**, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or for his religious practice, unless, under the color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or contribute, or any ministry; nor shall any person
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing shall prohibit or require the making reference to belief in, proceeding, activity, ceremony, school, institution, or place.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing in this article shall constitute an establishment of religion.
&gt; 
&gt; Art. 37. That no religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification for any office of profit or trust in this State
   . . .
&gt; Art. 39. That the manner of administering an oath or affirmation to any person, or denomination, of which he is a member, **generally esteem the most effectual confirmation by the attestation of the Divine Being**.

Those are the three articles in their entirety (apart from a few notes annotating document history).

I summarize those highlighted sections thusly:

 * Every man is required to worship a single unique God.

 * You are free to believe in a God who judges

 * If you do NOT believe in such a God, maintain, and contribute to a place of worship or ministry. You may also legally be denied representation by yourself in court. You may also legally be refused the ability to serve as a juror.

 * Every person who will ever be involved in the creation

I am not a lawyer

I would like to keep my budget under $1200 a month if that helps.  What I think I am looking for is a 1 BR apartment.  I have absolutely no idea what the area is like and am moving from Florida.  I will need to commute every day to the base

Also does anyone know if a Realtor would be a good way to find a place in the area?

If anyone is familiar with the area

I've spent the majority of the day trying to find the man involved in the hit and run but to no avail.



She was rear ended at ~45mph at the [intersection of Rolling Road and Security Blvd in Woodlawn MD](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ROLLING+RD+%26+SECURITY+BLVD+sb,+Maryland+21244&amp;aq=&amp;sll=39.31933,-76.921133&amp;sspn=0.013612,0.033023&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;geocode=FUHfVwIdu85s-w&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=ROLLING+RD+%26+SECURITY+BLVD+sb&amp;ll=39.313095,-76.755031&amp;spn=0.000851,0.002064&amp;t=h&amp;z=20). She was driving an Orange Dodge Caliber and the man who hit her was driving a Dark Blue Minivan. She described him as being an Older (probably in his 50s) black, male. She was hit in the rear so his car would likely have extensive damage. If any Maryland redditors see an older black male driving a blue minivan with a damaged front



Quick Info:
*Older Black Male

*Dark Blue Minivan with Damaged Front

*Rolling rd &amp; Security Blvd

*Woodlawn MD

EDIT:  Also foreclosures would be great.  I was on foreclosures.com a few month back but it ran $15-20 per month and I only saw one property I liked so i didn't think it was worth the money.

I'm relocating from the other side of the country - Seattle

If you've a moment and are able to answer a few quick questions

1)
Housing - anyone have any recommendations on cities to potentially live in?  (And even better - specific apartment complexes?)  I prefer places with low crime and fast internet (with rent around $1500 a month).

2)
Internet - Broadband / DSL providers in the area? I notice there seems to be Verizon FiOS in many places.  Is it worth it?


3)
Traffic - Google shows 5 and 6 lane roads for many of the major freeways to Baltimore

4)
Quirks - Any strange taxes
