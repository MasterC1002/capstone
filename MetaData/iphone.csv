1353242873.0,13eafm,All iPhone tricks in one posting,painintheass21,3468,830,256,"&gt;We are coming from: http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/13cv4k/what_is_the_least_commonly_known_iphone_tiptrick/#

1. Tapping comments and stories in Alien Blue with 2 fingers gives up votes

2. Another AlienBlue tip: Two finger swipe from left to right on a comment will give you that comment's full thread of replies. 

3. Tapping ""123"" then tapping the character you want then finally clicking back to the main keyboard can be a hassle. Instead hold down ""123""

4. Tapping the clock/top bar on a page will take you quickly to the top.

5. Tap chunk of text w/ 2 fingers to highlight the whole thing. Works only when commenting/editing etc.

6. **Be careful
If you go into the phone app
and hit call, along with other information about the surrounding cell towers. In addition, if you hold down the power button until the ""Slide to power down"" slider comes up and then hold down the home button until the app exits, you can tap on the carrier name in the top left corner to change between the numerical value and the visual representation (in bars) without going into ""Field Test"" mode. 
&gt;The values are always negative. In my experience
Anything above -80 is good
Anything below -100 is bad

7. Double click the upper case arrow to set caps lock

8. Force close a single app by holding the power button until the slide to power off slider appears

9. This may have been obvious but you can zoom in and out in the default Camera app by using two fingers to pinch and spread.

10. You can use more than a 4 digit PIN number. By turning off ""Simple Password"" and choosing only numbers instead and NO letters. You will get a number keypad to unlock the phone instead of a full keyboard. And you can use as many numbers as you would like and you you have to press OK to enter it. This makes your PIN number much much harder to guess. Since you would need to not only guess the number but also how many digits the pin contains to break in.

11. Swipe away banner notifications that inhibit you pressing a button on the top of the screen by swiping from RIGHT TO LEFT (will not work L TO R).

12. In Mail

13. Tapping the screen with two fingers while in Maps will zoom out

14. Add a shortcut for your email address (example @@). It makes filling in online forms much
&gt;Settings &gt; general &gt; keyboard &gt; shortcuts

15. Put a tracking number for UPS or some other mail services in a text field (notes

16. To continue listening to a video or music video from safari after exiting safari, and press play. Also works on the lock screen, useful for music videos, etc. 

17. A lot of people didn't notice the Emoji inclusion in iOS6. Under General-&gt;International-&gt;Keyboards-&gt;Add new keyboard. Then when you're sending a text, and hit the keyboard button to switch back to a regular keyboard.

18. Sleep Timer - While playing music in the Music App , scroll to bottom, click stop playing. Start Timer.

19. Pressing the volume buttons when alarm clock goes off for the snooze. I've caught myself accidentally turning it off instead of pressing the snooze button and find this method much safer and easier.

20. If you turn on accessibility settings you can tap out a custom vibration pattern or make the bright camera LED flash when you get a call or text. Then go into contacts

21. If you're getting a call you can just press the lock button to mute it instead of pressing decline. Pretty useful for when your phone starts blasting in your pocket during a class or meeting! Works also with the volume keys.

22. Holding the keyboard globe icon gives you a list of keyboards that are on.

23. Swipe from leftmost of screen to right in camera to access the camera roll instead of clicking it from the bottom. 

24. In camera app

25. Press the home button and lock button to take a screenshot

26. To reset the new message counter. Lets say you have a bunch of unread emails and you don't want to click through all of them. Click edit

27. When websites have embedded content that scrolls (like an extra area with scrollbars)

28. When your is screen off or the phone is locked while listening to music or just audio in general: Double Tap home button to bring up iPod controls to Pause/Stop or skip. Also works to resume last playing audio track whether native or 3 party. 

29. You don't have to swipe the homescreen to go to the next

30. Here's for the lazy ones: end a phone conversation by pressing the lock button. This way

31. If you want to search for a word on a page with safari

32. You can use rich text styling in the mail app. Select some text and bring up the context menu, underline, and indenting.

33. *#06# displays your iPhone's IMEI. Good to take down if you don't have the original box around you. You'll need the IMEI if your phone gets stolen or dislocated

1347570593.0,zubft,"My Opinion on iPhone 5's ""Missing"" Features",krazyfalcon,644,177,260,"I wrote an article [here](http://liteforecast.com/iphone-5s-missing-features)

After every launch, 9to5mac, The Verge, Engadget, Twitter, Facebook. Every website has comment streams flooded with messages about how the Lumia is so much superior, or how the iPhone 5 wasn't radical enough or how Apple has barely caught up with Android. Here's my opinions the iPhone 5's ""missing"" features.

* NFC

I currently own a Galaxy Nexus. Know how many times I've used NFC to share stuff with friends or pay for something with Google Wallet? None. Including technology that isn't widely supported into your flagship phone doesn't make sense. Why add weight and thickness if the extras aren't even widely supported? ​

* Wireless Charging

Again

* Screen Size

Before the 4"" debut

* Lightning Connector

Ever tried plugging in a Micro-USB or a 30-pin dock connector in the middle of the night before going to sleep and after turning off the light? It's not fun. Hell

* Radical Redesign

It's easy to do radical designs when discovering the best shape but there's no reason to keep launching new designs when you hit the gold mine. The consumers love the design and are willing to spend money for it. Why change it now? Sure, but don't try it out on your flagship phone. Apple doesn't have 400 different smartphones in the market like Samsung. They keep it simple and elegant.

* Conclusion

There's no point in adding a new feature unless it directly benefits the consumer. Just by adding random ideas that you can think of into your flagship phone doesn't make it the best phone in the world. Just because you can watch a video while typing a text message

For me (A Galaxy Nexus user) the things I bitch about are the fact that Apple's ecosystem is too closed​ (No defaulting of 3rd Party Apps or inclusion of apps like the barebones stocks app or the Newsstand folder which you can't delete). As for Windows Phone fans,,False,self,t5_2qh2b,False,,True

**Disable unnecessary Notification Centre (NC) widgets.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Edit*: drag unnecessary widgets out of the 'In Notification Centre' list and into the 'Not In Notification Centre' list.

* Why: Widgets such as Calendar and Mail will frequently pull information to keep 'updated'. The fewer widgets you have

* Why Not: You are in need of constant updates from all these applications (apps).

 
**Disable 'Emergency Alerts'.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Notifications*: toggle 'Emergency Alerts' to OFF.

* Why: Essentially a form of [push notification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_Service) that has a constantly open IP connection. 

* Why Not: You require or would like to have these notifications from your service provider.

 
**Disable Siri's 'Raise to Speak'.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Siri*: toggle 'Raise to Speak' to OFF.

* Why: The raise to speak function utilizes the infrared proximity sensor to constantly check how close a surface is to the face of the phone

* Why Not: You are a frequent user of Siri and its 'Raise to Speak' feature.

 
**Disable Mobile Data/Cellular for iTunes, and Reading List.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Mobile Data (or 'Cellular')*: under 'Use Mobile Data for:' list, 'Passbook Updates', and 'Reading List' to OFF.

* Why: Your mobile data will be used for these apps or features and whenever they update in the background.

* Why Not: You require these apps to have mobile data access (as opposed to wifi).

 
**Disable automatic time zone setting.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Date &amp; Time*: toggle 'Set Automatically' to OFF.

* Why: Location services will be used to check your position on a regular basis in order to adjust the time according to the time zone you are in.

* Why Not: You frequently change time zones or require this feature.

 
**Disable unnecessary System Services that require Location Services.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Location Services -&gt; System Services* (Note: System services can only be accessed when Location Services is toggled ON): toggle any of these system services that you do not require to OFF (personally

* Why: These system services are not essential to the phone's basic functions but utilize Location Services which can be a strong battery drain.

* Why Not: You require or utilize these system services.


**Disable Diagnostics &amp; Usage reporting.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About -&gt; Diagnostics &amp; Usage*: select 'Don't Send'.

* Why: Whenever a crash or error report is generated

* Why Not: You wish to help Apple address crashes or instabilities in iOS.",self,t5_2qh2b,1362187110.0,,4S,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/19ghmp/a_few_lesser_known_settings_that_may_improve_your/

I thought you might be interested in my journey from someone who literally knows **nothing** about programming to a published game developer. I know that this type of post would have been really helpful for me when was just getting started. Hopefully I can inspire someone in a similar situation!

**THE STORY**

About a year and a half ago

I always thought it would be pretty sweet to be a game developer but it was so out of reach that it never felt like a realistic goal. But one day in October of 2010 I just decided to go for it. I had nothing to lose so why not?

I learned bits and pieces of a bunch of languages, ActionScript, and Objective-C. Honestly though, I really don’t think it matters too much what languages you learn on. If there is one piece of advice that I can share about learning to program, it is this: **PROGRAM A LOT**. There really is no other way to learn besides doing, doing, doing, and doing again. Every time you make something new

Along the way I made a ton of stupid

* [A game about a man-rodent](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dtplj/thought_you_might_be_interested_in_my_very_first/) hiding in a town
* [A text-based minesweeper clone]( http://youtu.be/Cn_Oibc4sjg) with a custom-sized board and mine-count
* [A game called Pizza Guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLumD97DX8)
* [A game called Party Man](http://www.whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1000000423.png), so he kept literally crashing the party.
* [An app where you could create sequences of musical phrases](http://youtu.be/xWMsBGEwvbY) in the pentatonic scale
* [A flash clone of the classic snake game](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)
* [A flash clone of those driving-through-an-ever-shrinking-tunnel games](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)

Finally,” as if there were one way to make a game. But I realized I just need to make it however I could, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right or best way.

When I sent the game to beta testers, then I’m done!” a thousand times.

Submitting to the app store was terrifying. I was so paranoid that I would forget something huge. Something that could break the game or get it rejected. But at the same time, was done. I went from not knowing a thing about programming to finishing a game that I was very very proud of.

It’s already gotten some awesome previews on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/19/hands-on-with-whitaker-trebellas-polymer/)

Of course, programming Polymer has taught me so many amazing things. There’s a lot of really messy spaghetti code, but I honestly don’t care too much because it works. Next time I make a game I’ll be able to build upon what I’ve learned, and hopefully make something even more awesome. Until then though, I’m hoping for the best with Polymer. And I hope you enjoy it!

**TLDR:**

* A year and a half ago

* Today my first game

* I did all the programming

* It's 50% off for launch!

A prominent Italian site tried the lite version, I got an email from Apple saying they wanted to do an App Store feature of the paid version of the game. Apple featured the game last Thursday, and since then, it's been climbing the paid app charts in every country. It currently sits at **#13 in the UK** and **#48 in the US**. This is awesome, but after the feature is over, the game will drop back off the charts unless it gets into the top 5 or 10 apps. I seriously believe this game has the potential to make the top 5 and sustain it's position there.

I think this is my one big chance to literally change my life. The paid game is called Trainyard and the lite version is Trainyard Express. The price of the game was $2.99

I am planning on being completely transparent and honest with how this sale goes

If you're not sure if the game is for you

I've just finished writing up a lightweight [markdown engine](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/dg6nk/alien_blue_markup_support_is_in_development/) for CoreText (so that Reddit comments can be rendered very quickly on your device).

This means:

* Inline links (with optional footnoted buttons if you like those)
* Indented and correctly formatted quotes
* Support for Bold and Italic

For those with fat fingers

This is my first app in the App Store that I've written completely on my own during my free time. I have no concrete plans for it (other than that it will remain completely free and ad-free). I only want people to have fun with it!

**Anyways

*****
 
For starters, as Mailbox requires your email to be passed through their own servers. All of it;
&gt;  Mailbox is designed to help you manage your email account with other providers

***** 

One red-flag is that they make no assurances as to what will happen to your information if their service is bought by someone else;  
&gt; The assurances in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information if/when it’s transferred to a new entity. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information
    
(emphasis mine)  The wording is pleasant, you would be given the option to prevent the transfer of your data to the new ownership entity.
So the real question is what they intend to do with your data.  

*****

A second red flag might be this line;  
&gt; We will never share
    
The term ""affiliates"" makes this claim rather vague

*****

&gt; If you link your third party account to Mailbox
    
... I'm not sure what this one even means.  Is Google going to send Orchestra

One day, fine, whatever. 3pm later that same day, I received another text from AT&amp;T saying that I had exceeded my 2GB limit and was now incurring charges. Mind you, during this 7 hours, I was busy at work and only texted and got on facebook a few times.

This month, this would mean I used 600+mb in 10.5 hours between sleeping &amp; working.

Chatted an AT&amp;T rep and he said ""You have an iPhone 5 and it's faster - therefore you use more data"" which makes absolutely no sense.

So

So over at /r/apple

One of the modifications was an ever-present image of Steve Jobs (it's changed many times since then; the first one was quite obnoxious) in the right sidebar. I and many other readers thought this was excessive, with over 800 upvotes and an 81% liked ratio. The top comment, at 316 points, was to remove the picture entirely.

I decided to take matters into my own hands and write a GreaseMonkey script to remove the picture. I posted [Greasemonkey script to remove image on the right](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/i3na6/greasemonkey_script_to_remove_image_on_the_right/). Upon reading it

Some excerpts from his messages:

&gt;I did ban it. The r/apple subreddit is for news and stories

&gt; To be fair

&gt;At this moment

He is attempting to shunt all criticism to a [tiny thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/hxp2n/feedback_on_the_new_rapplehelp_layout_requested/) in a *different subreddit*, which is also in violation of his ""all CSS stuff goes here"" policy, is left unbanned.

Today I received an e-mail from kickstarter saying they have approved my project: the RADIUS case for iPhone and I would love to share this project with the Reddit community and I would be honored to answer any questions you have about the project and my journey to get there. And of course

Short story: My sister (a stay at home mom) wanted to start a business

The team is basically myself, I had to drive 20 hours to be at my other teammate's house because he has the video equipment and the DSLR to shoot the prototypes. 

So please check the project on kickstarter out, if not please help spread the project to your colleague, friends, family!

As I said above

UPDATE:

I really appreciate all of the comments and feedback here! Thank you for the support and criticism and the pledges! I will try my best to get the testing video done and post it

UPDATE 2:

Phone jack area photo:(note this is an early prototype
http://imgur.com/ZIPwo

UPDATE 3:

Hi all, the material company to see which material works best with low profile. With this thin design, it will obviously not have the protection that a conventional case would have. The meeting with them in next week, and I will start to do my own tests with various types of methods. Will keep you updated. Again, thanks for all the feedback and support, and also the criticism. It's all good, I am excited as heck and also anxious to be honest... 


UPDATE 4:

A big thank you
http://i.imgur.com/FkqVm.jpg (this is two weeks ago

I met with the manufacturer yesterday and we talked about all of the feedback I received here and other places. Most notable issues: 
1. The level of impact protection 
2. Scuffing due to the X frame
3. Comfort of the X frame
4. Keeping cost down

We will address all of those issues in a final master prototype, stronger and different types of finishing to make things smoother. The change will have to be minor and does not affect the design/change the appearance much. The 3M materials have yet to arrive, I will make another update on that when I received it. 

Thanks again and please continue to help us spread the word. If you or anyone you know want to start a kickstarter project

•Lack of apps
•Microsoft boasts how awesome their live tiles are
•Purchased music from XBox music is nearly impossible to transfer between different devices. (Not to mention I had to navigate through pointless animations and apps to play said music.)
•There isn't anyway to purchase videos of any kind on the device. 
•Pandora and apps like it would eat up my data plan even when I had stopped them (this is a known bug and there is an app to kill all the music processes but a person shouldn't have to do that.)
•Microsoft's ""in-and-out"" philosophy is crap. If you missed a notification you would have to search your never ending start screen hoping the tile is actually working and showing the notification. 
•Many apps lack basic functionality. For instance, and then fast forward again, hoping you don't pass up what you were looking for, thus having to rewind back. It's just a pain in the butt. Oh, and one very annoying feature, screen brightness has three options. None of which are very different from the other. 
•And lastly (for this list anyway, and if there is one it should work. And don't think you can just plug it in for 30 or so minutes and power through the rest of the day, when the Lumia needs charged its going to take at least a few hours to get to 50% battery.

I figured it would be nice to make a thread to share some hidden features or features that weren't really talked about iOS 6 Beta at WWDC. Some things I noticed:

* Downloading an app no longer pushes you back to the home screen.
* An app that has been updated will get a blue ribbon overlaid in the corner that says ""New"" (similar to a newsstand app).
* In the app store if an app is already installed the button will say ""Open"" instead of ""Installed"" and pressing it will open the app on your phone.
* In iMessage you will be able to link your email address to a phone number.
* Music app has been changed to look more like the iPad Music app.
* iTunes/App Store apps have been changed.
* The status bar now is a light semi transparent color and the color changes based off of whatever color the navigation bar color of the app you are using is.
* iPad gets a really nice default clock app.
* You can choose to show an iMessage alert from everyone or just numbers/emails you have in your Contacts.app
* Bluetooth on/off toggle now directly at the top of the Settings.app next to Wifi toggle

Edit:  

* Photos.app now uses a Photo Stream tab to access your photo stream instead of doing it as an album.
* Share buttons now use a grid like way to select where you want to share (iMessage, facebook, etc) instead of popping up as a list.
* In the iPad Clock app the temperature of a city shows up in the World Clocks view in addition to the time in that city.

Edit #2:  

* Phone.app keypad is now a light colored theme instead of dark.
* Camera.app now has a dark bottom bar

Edit #3:  

* When Do Not Disturb is active a moon icon will appear next to the clock. You can also set a time to turn on/off the DND feature automatically and can allow/block repeated calls within 3 minutes to go through.

Edit #4:

* A lot more emoji icons!
* iPad Settings.app has a thicker gray bar between the ""categories"" of the settings on the left scrolling table.

Edit #5:  

* Weather.app has a slightly different font (less bold) and the blue background kind of has a glow/gradient.

Edit #6:  

* With the new Maps.app zooming out all the way will show a 3D Earth instead of a 2D map. (only for Satellite/Hybrid view)

Edit #7:

* In Clock.app you can pick a song in your iPod.app to be used as an alarm.

Edit #8:  

* Don't recall if this was mentioned but in Settings.app you can set a different signature for each mail account now.

Edit #9:  

* Lost mode of Find my iPhone: When this is enabled the default wallpaper changes to a lock icon and a phone number can be input that will be displayed in addition to a message. A user can tap a button and if the device is an iPhone it will call the phone number you chose. In addition you will be able to see a location trail of the device if it changing location.
* Find my iPhone now shows the battery state of a device (how full the battery is and whether it is plugged in or not).

Edit #10:  

* You can now adjust the speed required to activate Double and Triple-click Home from Default

Edit #11:  

* Reminders.app When selecting a location for location based reminders you are no longer limited to locations in your address book. You can type a location manually.
* FindMyFriends.app You can have the phone notify a contact through a push notification automatically when you arrive or leave at a certain location. You no longer have to set up a reminder and then manually message them. I believe the caveat is that the other user has to have FindMyFriends.app installed on their phone as it goes as a push notification through that app.

Edit #12:  

* When a device is locked a lock icon no longer shows up in the status bar.

Edit #13:  

* Searching for an app in spotlight now also shows you the folder it is in.
* Adding a new tab in Safari.app will create it to the right of your current tab instead of all the way to the right.
* Mail.app allows attaching of photos/videos from within the application.
* The shutdown spinner indicator has been updated to retina quality.

Edit #14:  

* If you started push by turn navigation and moved to a different app you will receive a local banner as a notification when its time to make a turn.

Edit #15:  

* Formatting (bold

Edit #16: Credit to [Corrie9](http://www.reddit.com/user/Corrie9)

&gt; * The current date will be shown in notification center (only if there are upcomming events).

I just wanted to share that someone on the Apple Support Communities finally posted something that worked as a solution for me.  I don't know whether this will work for anyone (and it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that this even worked for me)

Here's the directions as they were presented to me:


1. Go to: https://supportprofile.apple.com/MySupportProfile.do
1. Log in if not already logged in.
1. Click on ""edit products""
1. Click on the ""x"" to the right of the product.

1332166204.0,r3g7o,Free Aluminium Case Giveaway (Details Inside),,328,81,846,"Hey r/IPhone! This past week i've promised to give away a number of cases here. Well

All you have to do is reply in this thread with 'enter me' and state which colour you want. I will take replies for 24 Hours before picking Four winners.

These cases are IPhone 4S specific for Verizon and the AT&amp;amp;amp;amp;T and will also fit the IPhone 4 Verizon. All European 4S's will be ok. Throwaway accounts will not be accepted or duplicate accounts. I only ask you pay the shipping cost of your choice but please keep in mind I am located in the UK so shipping may cost a bit

So that's it guys

http://imgur.com/vo9uf

http://imgur.com/xGGvr

Edit: Here is the website for the cases which will go on sale sometime in April. No word on the price yet but they will not be expensive.

http://www.icemdesign.com/yoo/index.php

Edit 2: The cases will be on sale from the 15th April. On the opening day if you order you get free shipping to the UK, and this will apply to one case.

I'm still waiting for the pricing but I will update once I have the information. 

Edit 3: There seems to be some confusion about the colours. They are Black

Edit 4: Some more pictures here with the case on the IPhone. If you look at the previously posted pictures you can see that iteration did not include the small cutouts at the Four antenna break points. The addition of these cut outs at the Antenna breaks make it easier for the phone to maintain a good signal. Sorry but i don't have the Blue to give away but it's available on the website when sales start.

I love 99% of the iPhone experience

Needless to say

So... I did some playing and had just about decided on the Note 2 when it came out

Here is what I am finding.

1. PATENT LAWS SUCK. Everything is slightly different. Just enough to not be exactly the same

2.  The larger screen is AMAZING. The Galaxy is truly a beautiful visual experience. 

3. Interestingly, the iPhone has a MUCH brighter, whiter, white. The Samsung has a very cool blue tint. You would never know unless you compare them side by side.

4. The iPhone feels way higher quality. The screen feels thicker

5. The iPhone is LIGHT years ahead on e-mail. It is ALMOST a deal breaker just how bad android email really is - but I am learning that there are apps that bridge the gap somewhat. I have completely given up on having all my email accounts in one app now and the email app I am leaning towards cost $20! That's enough to basically make the phone just $20 more expensive!

6. I thought texting was horrible

7. I'm finding apps are the only thing making android usable. For instance

8. Notifications are terrible. iOS has this down beautifully. I know when I have a text, phone call and more. With the Samsung, it makes all kinds of noises and gurgles that are meaningless to me right now. I'm sure with some work I will get it fixed, but out of the box it is bad.

9. Editing is a mixed bag. I LOVE the cursor and ability to move the cursor around text easily. Way better than iPhone and I suspect iPhone doesn't have this because of patent issues. On the other hand

10. Android isn't intuitive. Apple wins hands down here. I'm constantly staring at my screen wondering

11. Most everything you do on Android is a workaround or overly difficult, you drag one icon on top of another and name the newly created folder. With Android, you press and hold a blank spot on the home screen, then select edit and add folder and then you can put stuff in the folder and edit the name of the folder. I didn't even realize it HAD folders and ended up buying a $1.50 app that let me do custom folders (with more visual options) before I learned that you could do plain ones for free.

12. Visually

13. Battery life is atrocious. I thought iPhone was bad, but I already bought a Seidio Holster/Case so that isn't a great option. I end up charging in the afternoon!

14. The app stores are very close in having all the same apps you NEED. I was afraid I wouldn't have all my favorite apps from the iPhone

I'm sure that I have a lot to learn

If someone were to ask me if they should switch from iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S3, stay with the iPhone. If you are unhappy with the iPhone screen size, then consider the Samsung Galaxy S3 or perhaps even the Samsung Note 2 but be ready for some things you aren't going to like as well as the iPhone!""

To Apple's credit, WHY? Why isn't email as good as Apple by now? I get emails that do not fit on screen, I can barely tell what is read and what isn't. I had to download touchdown HD to get a decent exchange app and it cost $20. Gmail is terrible. Most Android mail options are NOT push... It is really poor. And that is a shame because email is a make-it-or-break-it app!

On the other hand

Feel free to ask questions and I'll tell you what I can...

I decided that rather than spend a lot of money to get it fixed, it sends as an iMessage, which I can't receive because I no longer have an iPhone.  Basically, I can't get text messages any more from most of my friends.

So be warned - if you ever plan on switching to a non-iOS phone (or if you might lose your phone, the person who has your phone will get your texts (according to some people, this happens even if you remote wipe the phone).

Hi everyone


As some of you may know

----------------------------------------------------

** How is Alien Blue HD different to Safari for browsing Reddit? **

I wanted Alien Blue on the iPad to be a very different experience when using Reddit.  I have developed the entire browser experience around a sidebar that allows a fast and intuitive way to switch between subreddits

----------------------------------------------------

** Can I customize the way things look in Alien Blue HD? **

You certainly can.  Alien Blue HD defaults to a Minimalist layout in comments (similar to the Reddit website.)  You can also switch to Boxed comments (or Classic) via:

Settings -&gt; Comment Settings -&gt; Comments Display Style

**Note:** I highly recommend that you enable ""Show Domain On Post List"" in the preferences section (apologies

----------------------------------------------------

** Why isn't this a universal app? **

There are two reasons:

1. I don't want to affect the donation-ware model of Alien Blue on the iPhone

2. I'm already shit-scared when I'm releasing updates for a single device.  With approx 2 weeks in review for each critical update

----------------------------------------------------

** How much work did it take to get here? **

You can see the [changelog](http://alienblue.org/beta/changelog-hd.txt) for the launch version.

----------------------------------------------------

** Why isn't it free? **

Here's what I wrote in another thread prior to the launch of ABHD:

&gt; I'm making this one a paid app

&gt; The free version of the app is purposefully unrestrictive so that people contribute only if they like the app, I don't want to reduce their enjoyment of the app via mobile ads.

----------------------------------------------------

The even crazier thing is that my app helps you search across your Gmail

There are a few interesting learnings from this. 

* The first is that the problem we're solving resonates across the globe. 

* The second is that we need to consider the adoption of email platforms globally rather than simply retaining a US-centric view. While we still probably will add support for Microsoft Exchange next

* The third thing is that we need to support multiple languages. The really cool part of this is that we already have been working on that and internally

We really started this business with US business professionals in mind but this last day has really opened our eyes to the possibilities. Super interesting stuff!

Edited to add: It was pretty surreal seeing my little app ranked higher than Gmail and Dropbox even though it's a small market. Also

Oh and in case you're curious

Basically the app allows you to see others traveling to the same country/city you're going to during the same time(think of it almost like a match-making service)

You can see other users nearby (obviously you have the option to hide your location) and message/connect with them.

There is also a virtual passport feature where you collect stamps for every city you check in to.
