*There are some overlap in these reasons

----

**REASON #0**  
*I don't hate reddit*  

The title of this post is an imagined quote

----

**REASON #1**  
*This website is a tool for building communities

This website isn't a community any more than Facebook is a community. This website is a tool for sharing information. It contains communities, worse, their bodies). Reddit is simply a tool for building communities within the website. This does *not* include the default subreddits, which are much too large to be considered communities. Anyone who makes an account—which is very easy—is automatically subscribed to those subreddits. This does not foster a sense of community; it fosters a sense of ""oh-shit-I've-been-thrown-into-these-subreddits-what-the-fuck-is-going-on?"".

The true communities on Reddit are non-default subreddits. When a user finds a subreddit organically, *that* is what fosters a sense of community. Being automatically subscribed to a subreddit with 2,000,000+ users does not really qualify as a community, unless you would also be willing to apply that term to a third of the states in the U.S.

I believe that many users think the admins foster make Reddit a community because of the website itself occasionally taking political stances which align with those of a lot of the users—SOPA/PIPA opposition, so it only makes sense that Reddit would oppose such legislation. Earlier in Reddit's history, the argument could possibly be made that the admins were a part of the community and helped shape the direction of the website, but at this point in time, and at this size, it just doesn't hold true anymore. Plenty of them are involved in the community in an unofficial capacity, but they are more reserved when speaking with their red [A]. *(side note: if the admins were attempting to foster a sense of community earlier in its history, what with their tolerance of subreddits like /r/jailbait and all.)*

I see people pointing to fundraising conducted within Reddit. The Reddit Wikipedia article's section on ""community and culture"" focuses largely on donation drives. Community fundraising efforts are usually just that: isolated to an individual community on the website. They are not site-wide, and I have no doubt that it's a positive thing—I was involved with the /r/ColbertRally fundraising for DonorsChoose.org—but it doesn't reflect on the entire website's user-base. It reflects on individual users and maybe on certain subreddits as a whole, but it is not a reflection of the website itself.

So Reddit isn't a community; it's a tool. It's a tool for building communities centered around a common interest. Maybe the topic is one as vague as /r/music; maybe as specific as /r/thedoors. It is not a perfect tool, and it grants those moderators a lot of autonomy, including the ability to modify the design of the subreddit; the website administrators are reasonably accessible (especially by comparison to other similar sites); the large pool of users increases the odds of interesting information being shared; comprehensive (if at times not-well-thought-out) moderation tools; and, yo dawg, you can even add tools to your tools: [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) 

----

**REASON #2**    
*I like many of the things that are popular on Reddit*

…but some redditors are making me hate these things. I'm an atheist. I'm a liberal. I like science. I like puns. I like memes. I enjoy using marijuana. I thought Firefly was a great show. I think Louis CK is the funniest comedian alive, especially compared to how bored I was by the Ron Paul videos I had to endure (sorry Paul fans). I watch The Daily Show pretty often and I occasionally think Jon Stewart's commentary has more substance than the 'serious' media.

I get called a concern troll but if you go through my history, making a shitty racist or misogynistic joke; I even started the massive spamming of the VOTE YES ON PROP 19 poster after Condé Nast refused to let Reddit run an ad in support of the proposition. That's either 3+ years of me telling the truth about my tastes, or I'm one goddamned dedicated concern troll. And while I may have been simultaneously poking fun at these things in /r/circlejerk, I'm still embarrassed at how oblivious I was.

Point being: a lot of my personal tastes overlap with those we in the Complainpire routinely attribute to the Reddit hivemind. I like to get new information about the things that interest me, and make disagreement a sin punishable by mass downvoting, used so often on Reddit as a form of censorship-by-committee (and don't get too hoity-toity, Circlebroke, you're as guilty of it as anyone). Content related to these topics lacks depth because depth is not rewarded inside of these communities. A lengthy religious debate in /r/atheism will lose out to text-over-an-image every time. An analysis of the pros and cons of a conservative political viewpoint will never beat out a lazy insult.

Eventually

----

**REASON #3**  
*I like meta discussion

A lot of the regulars in CB can be found haunting the other meta subreddits, and making sweeping generalizations about the culture of Reddit. That last one is sometimes a problem, as I have seen CB users accused of making sweeping generalizations about redditors—which does happen—but it is a necessary part of trying to discuss Reddit as a whole. We're not doing systems theory, here, and people will just have to trust that we realize that *not every redditor* behaves the same way; at least I know I do. Otherwise, where would the other CB users come from?

I guess I secretly wish I had been a sociology major, so no one *should* take the commentary too seriously. I mean, c'mon, CB is a direct spin-off of /r/circlejerk; who's taking that seriously?

It's too hot. It's too cold. I have a headache. This Mountain Dew is flat. These Cool Ranch Doritos are stale. My dogs are annoying. My lawn mower doesn't work right now. I'm a whiner. I like to complain. Other people do, CB wouldn't thrive, and neither would half the subreddits on this website. Hell, I think the rest of the website spends as much time complaining as we do. The only reason I've written this entire post is because people were complaining about CB users not ""liking"" Reddit.

----

**REASON #4**  
*Because some of the reasons Reddit sucks are why Reddit is good*

Chief among these reasons is the large userbase. As the user-base of the website grows, and making it easy to add to that material and make it visible (ability to edit posts/comments, and nested comment replies with voting).

Unfortunately, the more assholes and morons are going to be posting and commenting, and the more they are going to be upvoting worthless—and in some cases, hateful—content.

Before I landed on Reddit, and people interested in science and technology. That's what lured me here. But it's also what has led me to hate a lot of the people who represent viewpoints I agree with. The very reason I came to the website is the very reason I've contemplated leaving in the past: you can't just enjoy something on Reddit, you have to be willing to defend the thing you enjoy at all costs, including complete rejection of any detractors.

So with every positive thing about Reddit, but that means that /r/jailbait remained available for years and /r/atheism isn't moderated at all.

----

**REASON #5**  
*Because it's not your website*

If you have ever told another Reddit user to just leave Reddit (not even a particular subreddit

Users with the ""love it or leave it"" attitude should be reminded that they do not speak for the website or its users; only the admins speak for the website. Users are able to speak for the subreddits—the communities—they moderate, and as the site grows, those opinions are going to grow more diverse and the voices behind them will grow louder. Get used to it.

If I do not like a certain subreddit and I voice my opinion within that subreddit, when it's a moderator saying it.

But all too often, and that they'd be better off on some other website. The fact is that anyone who displays that level of intolerance to difference of opinion is an asshole and deserves to be called out on it.

If nothing else

----
----
----

I'll be completely serious for a moment: the main reason I come to Reddit is that I still manage to get more joy than headache from visiting and interacting on the website. As long as that remains the case, but that's true of any hobby.

1357068446.0,15s60l,"Anatomy of a Circlejerk, or, a  Grand Unified Theory of Redditors",Khiva,845,205

We all have little things that keep bringing up back to reddit, or a Sisyphean determination to wade through the defaults for the occasional nugget of insight. 

For me, most particularly due to its ability to proudly maintain a host of bewildering quirks:

* Proudly leftist and staunchly pro gay rights

* Priding itself on being attentive to propaganda

* Insisting that Gawker links be banned in the name of free speech

* Furiously waving the flag for Palestinian independence while flippantly rejecting Tibet

* Continuing to repeat a joke at length

Years of carefully studying the hive (I’ll bump up against my fourth anniversary soon) have led me to believe that the quirks which animate its peculiar psychology can be broken down to a number of core concepts, most of which have hitherto been bandied about in various comments and threads, and organize them into a singe integrated document.

**THE CIRCLEJERK**

Far and away, the tendency to circlejerk is not itself a terribly unusual tendency, as any group of people sharing an enthusiastic agreement will inevitably tend towards smug in group congratulation.  What makes reddit’s circlejerking so strange, however, is how whimsical the topics seem to be.  Any casual visitor to reddit is well-versed with its obsession with a strange set of narrow, peculiar interests.  The good folks at circlebroke have documented circlejerks over how [Osama bin Laden wasn’t such a bad guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wdnvr/good_guy_osama_bin_laden/), [two dollar bills](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yfgxx/an_ehipster_and_his_legal_tender/), [North Korean propaganda](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wjuf3/reddit_upvotes_obviously_fake_north_korean/)

**SECOND OPTION BIAS**

The seminal post on this topic was made by /u/douglasmacarthur, when discussing the dangers of taking revisionist history too seriously.

**SNOWFLAKING**

But why would second option bias come to be such a defining characteristic of the community?  It is clearly identifiable as a trend, tastes and practices that are intended to separate them from the crowd.  Snowflaking is, of course, not unique to reddit, but it conspicuously manifests itself in various forms:

* The way every thread on music inevitably turns into a “can you name a more obscure artist” contest

* The insistence on belonging to an unfairly persecuted class of people

* The loud rejection of every identifiable aspect of American culture

* The proud ignorance of celebrities (see also:  [Alpha Nerding](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2670))

**JERK ALPHA**

The king of all jerks, is clearly the “I am a misunderstood genius” jerk.  Because this is the jerk which spawns and influences nearly every other jerk the hiveosphere, I refer to it as **Jerk Alpha**.  It is the combination of Jerk Alpha and snowflaking that that yields second-option bias, and its infamous connections with bravery.  You see, it is not quite enough to be a misunderstood genius, the opinions the hiver holds must also be dangerous and unconventional.  For a typical example of these factors all playing out in real time, I refer you to the [reactions the movie Avatar garnered](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ah43h/reddit_what_did_you_think_of_avatar/) when it [first came out](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/agbba/sure_avatar_is_pocahontas_in_space_and_a_sequel/)

**THE EMPATHY DEFICIT**

However, we have to examine the peculiar role that **the empathy deficit** plays in the behavior of the hive.  We all remember that the hive erupted in outrage - and rightly so - at the awful bullying behavior of those middle schoolers to that older lady on the bus, right?  It’s interesting to compare that to the hive’s reaction when a bunch of internet porn viewers start bullying a cam girl – all of a sudden [everything is the girl’s fault](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xxvs4/i_think_this_linkthread_captures_the_essence_of/).  

What’s going on here?  Note how many of these reactions are determined by who the hive happens to identify with more.  Your average hiveminder has very little understanding of what it's like to be black or a woman, probably has some tics that make him noticeably unusual, probably has unusual interests, probably gets picked on. Your average hiver gets this. Hell, your average hiver probably was picked on for being gay, even if he wasn't. He knows what it's like to be mocked for this and it hurts.

Now, bullying crowd or the tearful recipient?  But when the bullying crowd is a group of anonymous keyboard warriors saying dickish things over the internet, how interesting that we suddenly have a whole new set of sympathies.

[A lack of empathy is, the average hiver places maximum priority upon issues with which he can empathize, while disregarding those which involve an unfamiliar form of experience.  The best example of this can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/127bll/truegaming_black_guy_rants_about_what_its_like_to/c6swdc9?context=3), though I also refer you to:

* Jokes about raping men, however, are hilarious.

* Girls walking around in public should have little expectation of privacy

* An abiding concern that [women are out to get us](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10vrkd/a_til_post_about_ladies_night_being_banned_brings/).

Note how the only thing which seems to unify these disparate reactions is whoever the hiver tends to immediately identify with most.

Now, given the hive’s affinity for leftist politics.  Personally, however, I found that comparing [the hive’s relative reaction to Palestine (most important issue!) and Tibet (omg shut up already!) to be quite telling](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/14of45/if_you_need_any_further_proof_of_the_hollow/), suggesting that what animates the hive is less compassion than the opportunity to take an “unpopular” opinion.  Once again, the prime movers are snowflaking and second-option bias, not bone-bred political convictions.

There is even, one might expect the hive to reject such terms and their hurtful etymology.  Note, however, that there’s no “second option” in this case, no in-law or journalist to contradict.  No one, not even Republicans, argue in favor of the usage of “faggot, because of its quasi-meme status

**CONTENT VS. COMMUNITY**

But what about other quirks, whether in jokes, news or serious minded discussion.  The value of the information is limited to its single use absorption.  Community users, on the other hand, are attracted not just by the raw value of the content but also by the need to connect and integrate with what they take to be a community of friends and pseudo-friends.  Community users will repeat a meme far beyond the point at which its inherent comical value has been bled dry because it functions as a symbol of in-group coherence - think of it as like a digital high-five amongst a cohort of people “in the know.”  This is why in-jokes maintain a life far beyond the value of the original joke, as it functions as a reminder of the group’s unique social cohesion.  This is also why content users roll their eyes with utter incredulity as yet another chain of beaten-down references - the joke has long since lost its inherent comic value, but community users are still banding it around because they are extracting a value from it which content users either don’t want or don’t need.

**CASUAL VS COMMITTED**

The final set of concepts necessary to explicate reddit’s behavior is to understand the distinction between **casual users and committed users.**  This distinction is rather more trivial than the others, reddit clearly caters to casual users, and from a business perspective this makes a certain amount of sense since unique visitors power a website’s cachet.  However, there is a certain danger in this, as the more bland and watered-down the experience becomes, the more it becomes indistinguishable from others, the easier it is to abandon.  The casual users who are driving certain trends in the quality of content are also liable to the be most likely to move onto the next thing.  Despite everything I’ve written here, and what reddit can manage to be

&gt;Overall
 
WHAT??? You mean bitching about u/jij and posting articles from rawstory.com with sensationalized titles is NOT growth and evolution? Well I'll be damned.

But seriously what do you guys think will happen to these two garbage subreddits after they're taken from the default list? I know that /r/atheism has been torn asunder by removing ""may mays, will jerk itself raw? Thoughts? ",We Did It!,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,

It should be no secret to any long time redditor that the reddit community has a tendency to fixate on certain topics to the point of gleeful, however, comes with the strange diversity of obsessions - why be so progressive on subjects such as gay marriage and yet veer close to outright prejudice on issues of race and gender?  Why loudly trumpet the cause of Palestine and yet express bored disinterest to the analogous situation in Tibet?  What does any of this have to do with Mother Teresa?  Or tipping?  Or creepshots?

When presented with such a bewildering kalidescope of obsessions, I’m convinced that a vast amount of these peculiar quirks can actually be explained by a few simple rules of thumb - tendencies which characterize the average redditor, and which color the shared outlook into a series of odd, but predictable convictions.  Back at the beginning of the year [I wrote a lengthy post introducing some of these concepts](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15s60l/anatomy_of_a_circlejerk_or_a_grand_unified_theory/), now I’d like to return to that discussion in order to revise it a bit and, more importantly, to demonstrate how they can be applied in order to unify the perplexing variety of obsessions.

**It’s my contention that around 90% of the circlejerks on reddit derive from four simple principles - one single Jerk Prime

* **Jerk Prime - I am a misunderstood genius.**

The ""misunderstood genius"" jerk holds pride of place because it acts not only as the progenitor of its own minor jerks (_social conventions are beneath me_), they are both the product of a need to feel like a misunderstood genius, and then, once produced, taken as evidence that they were a misunderstood genius all along.   Certainly, all of the jerks are snowflaking of one degree or another, but Jerk Prime is no doubt the most treasured

The purest distillation of this jerk is most visible in the recurring [I’m too smart for school and that’s why I failed](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dqoh9/raskreddit_and_its_untapped_geniuses_explain_how/) posts

**The Alpha Jerks**

* **SELECTIVE EMPATHY**

* **Rule of thumb - In any given dispute

As I wrote in [my prior post](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15s60l/anatomy_of_a_circlejerk_or_a_grand_unified_theory/), [while according to reddit the disaster on the cam channel was all the girl’s fault.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xxvs4/i_think_this_linkthread_captures_the_essence_of/)

Why the differing reactions?  Well, tossing out jibes and insults?  Not them, so the bullying recepient is held to be correct.  In the case of the cam girl, however, suddenly the bulliers are keyboard warriors, tossing out cruel insults from behind a veil of anonymity.  Strikingly similar situations, but suddenly the recpient is in the wrong.

Let’s apply this to a few more situations:

* **Gay marriage**:

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Loud
| Socially abnormal targets of bullying and ridicule  |    Definitely Correct|    

* **Race**:

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Average black male. |          |    
| Average white male.  |    Definitely Correct|

* **Gender**

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Average white male. |        Definitely Correct  |    
| Average white female.  |    |    

* **Any situation involving children.**

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Child. |         |    
| Average adult nearby.  | Definitely Correct   |   

* **Usage of ""Op is a Fag""**

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Socially abnormal targets of bullying and ridicule. |         |    
| Edgy internet forum dwellers.  | Definitely Correct   |

Now let’s make things a bit more subtle.  Remember the violentacrez controversy?  How fascinating was it that the same community which decried the invasion of violentacrez’s privacy was comparatively silent at the fact that [what got violentacrez into trouble in the first place was invading other people’s privacy?](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/10/redditors-stand-gawker-protect-child-pornography/57850/)  Again let’s apply Selective Empathy.  On the one hand we have anonymous attractive females wandering around in public
(http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11aiuy/when_youre_a_woman_or_a_young_girl_in_public/)

Notice how Selective Empathy plays out in the following scenarios:

* A rowdy crowd of men gropes a woman.  [She should have known better than to be a crowd of rowdy men.](
http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/14y1nx/girl_lifts_her_top_up_in_crowd_only_to_be_groped/c7hlsq0)

* Jokes about raping men and the trivialization of male rape are commonly complained about.  [Jokes about raping children are hilarious.](
http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yfgcu/really_how_do_you_let_this_headline_through/c5v3ul9)

* [Guy rudely pushes woman out of the way of his photo](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gj9fb/how_i_deal_with_random_photobombers/).  Compare to how reddit would have reacted if it had been a frat boy pushing some nerd out of the way and then braying with laughter about it.

My personal favorite example of second-options bias is the hive’s astonishingly divergent reactions to Palestine and Tibet

I once came across a comment which summed up the attitude pretty well:  [Just imagine how amazing this world would be if we had a few more Hitlers and a few less Mother Theresas.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1aclnc/the_only_one_who_isnt_literally_hitler_is/c8wfemi)

The most prominent Beta jerk of Second-Option Bias is your:

* **Edgy Hipster Jerk**:

* **Rule of thumb - The best known or most popular version of anything is automatically bad.**

Naturally, popular TV shows (Big Bang Theory sucks), Apple (brainwashed), Digg (when it was popular enough to be a threat to reddit), Avatar (despite [praising it before it became popular](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ah43h/reddit_what_did_you_think_of_avatar/)), Thomas Edison, etc. 

Of course, Beta Jerk, the:

* **Amerikkka Jerk.**

* **Rule of thumb - Every uniquely identifiable aspect of American culture or society is automatically bad.**

Examples of things that suck about America:  [ice cubes]

For an interesting thought experiment in how second-option bias plays out, while the latter are savage mongrels trying to drag down Eutopia with their medieval beliefs.  I don’t think this really files under empathy given that Israelis are too unfamiliar to be identified with and Europeans too incandescently perfect, but I think it works pretty well as an example of vulgar contrarianism.  

* **BROGRESSIVISM** 

* **Rule of thumb - Give me everything I want

Reddit’s affinity for social programs should be pretty well established, circumventing the very taxes which make their social welfare programs possible.

Brogressivism leads to some strangely selective libertarianism.  Although reddit is sometimes noted as a “libertarian” community, save for the fact that reddit simply likes them and wants them.  Note again the role of Selective Empathy here, as the people most likely to be hurt by the ready availibility of guns and drugs are likely to be poor inner-city residents, and therefore unlike the redditors themselves.  Again, libertarian when it comes to gettings things, socialist when it comes to getting things.

The affinity for free things and the aversion to sacrifice extends beyond policy

Along with a splash of the Amerikkka jerk, not me!” is of a kind with “Make the rich pay for that, not me!,” (ignore the fact that in the former case, the customer would pay the same amount no matter what, the lack of rigor is what reveals it to be more instinct than position).

This is the big one: JULIAN FUCKING ASSANGE, and Reddit's bizarre attitude towards rape.",,754,309, this post would be replaced with a Microsoft Paint picture consisting of repeatedly spray painted curse words and a line drawing of a weeping swan

I have only been vaguely following the WikiLeaks story, I have come upon an opinion which has proved rather unpopular. And that opinion is that Julian Assange is a slimy fuck.

This is a man who is wanted for questioning for rape. Rape is not a minor crime. Rape is a very serious crime. That I should have to fucking state this fact, under the nebulous reasoning that if he is extradited to Sweden for rape offenses, this naturally means that the USA will extradite him further to there so that he can be held indefinitely without trial and tortured. This, incidentally, is not my use of hyperbole; this is actually what the top comment in the /r/worldnews thread about it is suggesting WILL happen if Assange is sent to Sweden:

&gt; [It's extremely comforting for me to know that Assange will not be put to death in the US and will only face indefinite detention without trial and relentless torture. I will sleep better tonight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/yknz8/sweden_does_not_want_to_extradite_assange_to/c5wflu1)

Where did this poster pull this assertion from? Directly out of his shitter. There is no fucking evidence whatsoever at present that the USA would extradite Assange if he went to Sweden

But don't point this out. Because Reddit are sitting in their little circle wanking each other off something good and chronic over this

Also don't point out that Assange has done an excellent job of conflating his being extradited to Sweden for rape with the USA not liking him

But what of those who *do* address the actual rape accusations? Who do actually understand what it is Sweden want to ask him about? Surely they might think, why won't he go to Sweden and answer the questions and clear his name?

FUCK NO! DISCREDIT HIS ACCUSERS INSTEAD AND PRETEND IT WASN'T RAPE.

It will take a lot of strength for me to not write in all-caps for the rest of this self-post, if my language is a little bit... blunter than I might otherwise prefer.

Reddit's attitude to rape is frankly fucking *obscene*. The concept of privilege, and then pretending it's all a bit of harmless fun. If you have an OUNCE OF FUCKING EMPATHY and HUMAN GODDAMN DECENCY you would realise that maybe it isn't the nicest thing, and maybe rape should be treated as a serious matter.

But we're into different territory here. One of Reddit's peculiar complexes is the *false rape allegation*. Reddit is goddamn terrified that some woman, don't stick your dick in crazy amirite guise? And now, with lots of documents from Swedish prosecutors and a Reddit hero being accuse of rape, Reddit can jerk itself to a creamy finish over this.

Every aspect of the case against Assange so far has been picked apart ruthlessly by the hordes of commenters. Every statement, how the charges came about, all of it has been pored over and analysed and fucked around with by lots of armchair detectives who have all come to the conclusion that Assange is completely innocent because bitches be crazy. And the ones who don't bemoan that he is ""innocent until proven guilty"", which would be fair enough if Assange wasn't the one currently trying to extricate himself from the judicial process.

I'm going to level with you. Rape is under-reported precisely because of attitudes like this. Because women who report that they have been raped have all of this and more happen to them; the statements, the circumstances, gets pored over and analysed and fucked around with much in the same way. On a smaller scale, certainly, but in the same fashion. Rape itself is traumatic; having to go to court and explain how you were raped and what happened, and know that you are being *judged* for what you say almost as much as the person who assaulted you heaps trauma upon trauma. It is an awful process. I do not wish it upon anyone.

And Reddit doesn't help. It takes the over-analysis and the prying and goes wild. Does anyone, which is straight up rape virtually whichever way you put it, and another alleged he held her down and penetrated her, which is... well, what else can it be?) Take them as a case study. Think about how they must feel having everything about a traumatic experience in their lives blown up and dissected around the world by people who have never met them, in newspapers by journalists who don't even know their names. By anonymous commenters on Reddit, hiding behind usernames. ([This Guardian editorial discusses it far more eloquently, than I can.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-balcony-defence-editorial?INTCMP=SRCH))

It is this, actual rapists explaining how they raped people, Reddit minimised their crimes and reassured them that they weren't bad, really.

False rape accusations are rare. Very rare. And you know what? I would rather one innocent fucker gets dragged through a court process by some vindictive bitch whose accusations are taken with the utmost seriousness, being slutty, whatever the latest justification is these days.

This probably got a bit unfocused. I am ranting a bit. So let me summarise.

The Assange jerk is ridiculous, when the jerk finally does get round to discussing the accusations, Reddit snaps into its default mode of victim-blaming, rape apology and paranoia about false accusations. This is a harmful culture, it's a goddamn scary thing that this website is full of people willing to not give someone brave enough to come forward about a deeply traumatic crime the benefit of the doubt, and sadly all it does is act as a case study for society's treatment of rape at large.",Quality Post,,,

It's important at this point to be very careful what you say; too much detail or bravery and people will probably call the story fake and unbelievable
 
 
We decided to opt for ""car ride argument""
 
&gt;In the car ride back from our baptist church last Sunday
&gt;
&gt;The things he was saying made me so angry that I decided to come out as an atheist right there and then. This quote helped me realize that I don't need their thoughtless approval.
&gt;
&gt;Things have been tense at home since then. I'm worried about what might happen next.
 
 
At this stage, I still think it's worth it.
 
 
### 4. Background
 
The people of /r/atheism see themselves as pseudo-scientists, particularly one that pays homage to [Pale Blue Dot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) is a good idea to appeal to the masses.
 
Another popular choice is a picture of the quotes supposed author sitting ([1](http://i.imgur.com/hTfF9.png), presumably owning theists ([1](http://i.imgur.com/2zVuV.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/B2YMy.jpg)). All these pictures are from the first 150 top ranked /r/atheism posts of all time.

The polls are in. On February 25th 2013, technological, and economic powerhouse, experiencing the crippling throes of ongoing, jet fighter pace modernization and the constant threat of North Korea.

There is a growing divide of cultural clash between the younger and older generations, it's a very personal and fascinating topic. Doing a little research would inform you that South Korean politics is a heinous mudslinging match where the candidates accuse each other of horrendously hyperbolic shit. Can we trust redditors to do some light background checking before formulating their opinions about a political figure rather than basing it on a three minute perusal of her Wikipedia entry?

Who are we kidding?

&gt; [A bad day for women's right in korea

Except she isn't [ultraconservative](http://groovekorea.com/article/presidential-preview-park-geun-hye). In fact, and reducing partisanship in ROK politics. The ultraconservative claim is even more ridiculous because *she has constantly been attacked for being single*. Madame Park has never been married nor does she have any children, and she has continually said she has no plans to marry or have kids in the future. Even liberal politicians in the ROK attack her over this because of the deep-rooted expectation that women must be married and childbearing. 

The key point where she and Mr. Moon differ on is foreign policy towards the DPRK, who took a harsher position against the DPRK. Madame Park said that she wants to stay open to diplomacy but will maintain a similar stance as her predecessor. Apparently this is totally unreasonable to redditors who believe that the DPRK, [consistently ranked as the worst violator of human rights on the planet](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2012/11/19/we-cant-ignore-north-koreas-human-rights-record) and ruled by [a legitimate dictator family that promote cults around itself](http://www.uscirf.gov/images/stories/pdf/nkwitnesses.pdf), should be treated like glorious, enlightened Sweden.

And the fact that she's a woman and the ROK's first female president doesn't matter whatsoever because she is LEterally the daughter of Hitler.

The latter part of what this redditor said about her father is what got me the angriest but I'll be addressing that further down.

&gt; [I've heard that she is the Sarah Palin of South Korea.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/153z2p/s_korea_has_its_first_woman_president/c7j4n73)

&gt; [History and Business Administration are not nearly as logical and rigorous as electrical engineering.

&gt; [Ugh. South Korean women's rights frustrate me to no end.
The solution to gender inequality lies in removing gender from the equation where it is unnecessary, seems to be that women are inferior, and therefore the rest of society must compensate. That does nothing but justify the inequalities that currently exist.
The irony is that it's the women, although its official name in Hanja is 女性家族部) that are perpetuating this bullshit. What a joke. And Park Geun-hye seems none the wiser.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/153z2p/s_korea_has_its_first_woman_president/c7j50jv)

Oh yes, and the existential crisis of Koreans trying to determine where the lines between modernization and westernization blur, leading to a serious critique of what aspects of their culture are to be celebrated and which aspects should be discarded for the sake of progress rather than for the sake of conforming to a Western expectation of how Koreans *should* be. I thought that the path to eliminating sexism in Korea was going to be something that required empathy, dialogue, and understanding.

All Koreans needed was some neckbeard to say

Let me also copy and paste the [Hanja from the Wikipedia article about the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Gender_Equality_and_Family) so it totally looks like I'm an expert on the esoteric subtleties of Korean-adopted Chinese characters instead of some smug douche who googled it in five seconds! The use of Hanja in the Korean language is either for ceremony or to convey cultural concepts quickly without the need for further explanation

He would have been less of a douche if he actually posted the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family's name in Hangul

The literal translation of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family's Korean name

&gt; [Her father was Park Chung-hee. An Army General who - (after a military coup) - ruled S. Korea from 1961-1979. He was your typical run-of-the-mill dictator kinda guy.. autocratic rule.. arrests and detentions.. opponents were held without trial and tortured.. He was assassinated in 1979 by Kim Jaegyu - the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/153z2p/s_korea_has_its_first_woman_president/c7j3hid)

... 

&gt; [The brainwashed older generation love him. It's the reason Park Geun Hye is so popular getting 94.5% of the over 70 vote. She would be unqualified if she wasn't his daughter because on her own merits

These are the two jerks that really piss me off: Equating her father with someone like Stalin (and anyone who liked him a brainwashed zealot) and shitting on her qualifications.

First of all, at which point she dropped out of politics. She returned to public service in the 90s during the IMF crisis in Korea. In total, she has over 20 years of political service. Madame Park has shown a consistent ability to rally her party and constituents when attempting to reject or pass legislation. Good leaders aren't always good speakers. Her debates may leave much to be desired and I don't always agree with her politics but this woman is a fucking boss. Whether you support her or not, she has demonstrated many times that she can get shit done.

Second

Shit, bell bottoms that could house two Boy Scout troops, and a guitar he hustled off an American soldier from a game of eight-ball. Even his hippie ass liked General Park. He didn't *love* him, but despite the militant authoritarianism that came with the General's rule and craziness at the end of his regime, my dad was still was grateful that the General took over and didn't leave a nation still filled with starving vagrants and desperate criminals. Clearly the General is a controversial figure and for good reason. It's very hard to praise him as a saint of the people or renounce him as a ruthless demagogue but to redditors this distinction is totally lost. To be honest I was expecting them to praise the General given how apologetic /r/worldnews can get with dictators.

It's not even like these assholes are Korean. Why do they feel so strongly about the politics of a country they don't live in based off of second-hand kneejerk controversy on a goddamn social aggregator site? I don't get it. I truly don't fucking get it.

Okay. Rant done. I'm not even going to bother with all the StarCraft and ""North Korea Best Korea"" memes that are slowly beginning to pollute that thread.

It's okay, I guess; nothing all that exciting.  Still, thousands of non-subscribers poured into /r/AskHistorians to read the comment and leave their own in turn, with consequences exactly as you imagine.

**Last night**, and was doing so at a rate very difficult to stem, the /r/AskHistorians mods decided to remove the comment and all of its off-topic clutter.

Which should have been the end of it, speculation, and discussion of current events.  Straightforward.

But no: it was actually the second coming of Hitler.

1361482408.0,18z8tt,When the redditor persona seeps into real life,4-6forceout,436,55,445,"First post. This is not based on an individual reddit post.

I hate reddit, but that's not why I hate it. I hate it because of what it's done to friends of mine. I'm a 24 year-old college grad in Arizona, and over the past 3 years or so I've watched a few of my friends completely abandon thinking for themselves, and instead they just parrot the opinions of the hivemind. 

One guy, tweet, and facebook status is either ""Scumbag ______"" or, ""I don't always...  but when I do..."" I don't know if it's sad or if it makes me angry, but it's aggravating nonetheless.

These guys (all guys, Gabe Newell, etc. To be honest I'd never heard of any of those people except Sagan prior to the incessant, obnoxious facebook love given to those heroes by my friends. Every day of the election season led to another 4 FB posts about rich, evil Mitt Romney, usually from sources like alternet. And heaven help you if you called them on their echo-chamber news sources - The Smugness, the defining quality of the redditor

They proudly call themselves redditors *in public.* I'm posting this in my incognito browsing mode under an account I created 10 minutes ago, and depressing, that a group of otherwise smart people would fall into this. I understand checking this site because you're really bored at work, or alone on a weekend, but I can't imagine why a smart, mostly grown up adult, would choose to identify himself with /r/atheism's nonsense.

My question here is, for they know not what they do. But do any other mid-20s or older people see their friends exhibiting ""redditor"" behavior in real life? Communicating in meme-form, [fetishizing pop-scientific](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/377/415/c28.gif) drivel, or just general reddit-induced smugness?

It's a commonly stated phrase, but I'd hope you understand the point I'm trying to make here. The fact is, there are small communities that can come off even jerkier. in an ironic way. Not with any humor at all.

In this corner. In the blue shorts. Sporting 3924 ""Masterminds"". All the way from Introvert

If you're aren't in the know (because you aren't a ""mastermind"")

Now, and no flash photography. It'll startle the introverts. 

As we enter /r/INTJ we'll first explore the sidebar to see the structure that forms this community.

&gt;For those who score INTJ on MBTI tests.

We're first greeted with a simple explanation on what the subreddit is. Seems fine to me. People with similar personalities getting together. In theory in sounds great

&gt;For ♀ there's also /r/2X_INTJ

Next

&gt;MastermindBooks
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/MastermindBooks

They have their own book club! Not just books. Mastermind books! Sadly


We then have a link to take the MBTI so you can learn if you're special or not. Followed by some informational explanations of what an INTJ actually is.

In our first explanation

It already sounds like everything Reddit wishes they were.

The next explanation is a bit more in depth and covers a bit more of the downsides of INTJism.

&gt;Personal relationships, and are willing to spend a &gt;great deal of time and effort on a relationship, the knowledge &gt;and self-confidence that make them so successful in other &gt;areas can suddenly abandon or mislead them in interpersonal &gt;situations.

While it seems that INTJs are brilliant

The bonus that we get from this article is a much bigger list of famous INTJs. Such as: Susan B. Anthony! Lance Armstrong! Augustus Caesar! Jane Austen! Dan Aykroyd! Chevy Chase! Michelle Obama! Arnold Schwarzenegger! Thomas Jefferson! JFK! Hannibal Lecter! And GANDALF THE GREY!

In our final article

&gt;As an INTJ, where you deal with things &gt;rationally and logically.

Redditors see themselves as this

The rest of the page is a general explanation of the personality type. Where's the fun in that?

The rest of the sidebar are just more links to things. I might suggest checking out the forums. It gives more insight in the mind of a Mastermind.

Now, that I wouldn't suggest sitting down or touching anything without using a condom.

&gt;[Fellow INTJs

Sure

The top rated comment in this thread is simply this:

&gt;Yes.

Luckily, there also great replies like these:

&gt;It's not smugness. It's a bald statement of fact

&gt;The people I do run into on a daily basis seem to have a hard time comprehending that hitting themselves in the head with a mallet twenty times a day isn't something they actually have to do

&gt;Haha

&gt;The vast majority of people are either idiots or tools... maybe both.

&gt;I try not to. I really
I once had a (pretty terrible) HR manager and boss accuse me of ""thinking I was better than everyone"".

&gt;I don't view them as idiots; they are idiots.

&gt;I do and that's one of the reasons my me and my ex broke up. She said that I shouldn't think that other people are stupid all the time. So
I'm a fairly intelligent man, but life isn't nice. We INTJs may come off as arrogant and elitist, however I feel that it's well deserved. 


There is also the side that is pointing out how smug of a belief that is

We then find this post:

&gt;[Why are most of the people on this subreddit arrogant

We find in this thread a person questioning the first thread we visited. As it stands so far from my view

&gt;We're not saying we're superduper incredible perfect people by any means. I know I've got plenty of flaws. But I do a lot of things very much better than almost anyone else I've met
I don't feel that I'm super-brilliant. I feel like I should be average. But person after person after person I interact with day after day

&gt;Nope

Everyone sure is stupid except for us

I must also note that there are legitimate threads on this subreddit about things other than how great INTJs are. Many are people struggling. Struggling with how AWESOME they are. They also discuss how difficult it is to be an introvert in a world ruled by extroverts. 

Feel free to browse yourself. You'll see that even the threads about the downsides to being an INTJ tend to have an arrogant twist to them.

[Even comedic (At least I hope it's trying to be funny.) posts are looked upon with contempt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1111ll/the_complete_idiots_guide_to_the_intj/)

&gt;This article makes us sound like assholes... it just takes the truth and then adds a bunch of ego on top. Not representative of INTJ's at all.

&gt;Jokes apart

I'm not a Mastermind

As you browse you may notice a theme. There seems to be an underlying prejudice against non-Masterminds. Not only are they all idiots. [They're also always trying to cut into my alone time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/110gz3/intjs_how_do_you_feel_when_extroverts_deny_you/)

&gt;I give them one-word answers and treat them coldly until they get the hint. My extrovert roommate decided to move into another room today
Mission accomplished?

Excellent approach. Drive people away. But I think the next one is my favorite.

&gt;Like destroying Tokyo and putting all their loved ones to the fire and sword.
Ahem.
Unfortunately, after days of nonstop family gatherings, coffees with old friends, big Sunday dinners, babysitting of the cousins, parties, etc., parents. Moving out has made me love them more

How dare your family want to spend time with you when you come and visit them.

I'd finally like to briefly cover the ""Top"" section.

Here you'll find that INTJs seem to actually find humor in some things. They do also seem to realize how truly introverted they are. Seeing as I've been rambling long enough

I'd like to end the rant by stating that I have nothing against introverts. I may be a social butterfly

And here we end our tour. I wish it could have been more concise and maybe better structured

[""Women with endometriosis tend to be more attractive""](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/10prmm/women_with_endometriosis_tend_to_be_more/)

Actual finding ([non-free article](http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12\)02127-9/abstract)): women with endometriosis, larger breasts, leaner bodies, and higher attractiveness as rated by a panel of judges. Maybe this is because estrogen-mediated feminization underlies both endometriosis and those markers. It already suggests new risk factors for the disease that may save women from sickness and infertility.

How do redditors feel about that? The top-voted comment and some followups:

&gt; the way they conducted this test (2 males and 2 females rating patients) seems like something out of that Archer episode (Marry

&gt; ...

&gt; Immediately closed the article and down voted. What a joke.

&gt; ...

&gt; The problem with reddit, meaning that if something incredibly wrong hits the front page, you're shit out of luck and it's too late to try and save anyone from walking out the front door thinking ""severe endometriosis sufferers are attractive!""

&gt; ...

&gt; There are certain types of official pseudoscience that reddit already knows are bad (vaccines cause autism, sceptical, and sciency. Then an article like this appears and no one knows what the script is and we bring on the stupid.

None of these people read the whole MSNBC article

&gt; &gt; Other researchers took measurements of the women, and their ""breast-to-underbreast"" ratio — a measure of breast size.

&gt; &gt; Results showed that the women with severe endometriosis had lower body mass indexes

&gt; &gt; The women also completed a questionnaire about their sexual history

&gt; This is a fucking joke. All the disorders in the OP's title are spectrum disorders

&gt; I had to snort &amp; sneer when I saw ""near perfect sensitivity"". junk science at its best.

&gt; This should be the top comment. Kneejerk scientism is just as gothic in its sense of foreclosure as any form of superstition.

&gt; Sensitivity is not the same as specificity. True positives will test as positive

Consider the arrogance of attempting to refute a scientific study based on the title of a reddit post

    look through the paper to see where they discuss why they eliminated that hypothesis

Here's how redditors deal with that:

    call the paper junk/pseudoscience

And sometimes they may be corrected by people who pointed out that the issue is addressed within even the news article about the research.

I call this arrogance because it's as if these commenters believe that, who've spent years of their life working on this problem, and make a career out of saying things they can defend with evidence and picking apart other people's logic gaps; nor to any of the reviewers, whose entire role in this process is to find flaws and either require changes or reject fundamentally unsound papers. It's possible that you have a good point. What's arrogant is to assume no one else thought of it.

In other words, their armchair speculation is just as good as lab work and data collection, and more than sufficient to tell the researchers that their work is bad and they should feel bad. Science, to them, is just another internet argument.

---

One particular irony of the second example is that the reddit thread actually links to the research article itself

I think the fact that it made the frontpage is actually evidence of how few people even clicked on the link; research articles are written in a highly technical dialect that is mean to be very precise for experts, because even as a scientist myself, I am unqualified to read a paper from outside my field and would much rather have a layperson's explanation in plain English.

---

An even better irony is that it's an open-access article. Every time the issue comes up, so how is it fair to put up a barrier between the taxpayers and [professionally edited, formatted, published, and hosted summaries of] their data?! Never mind that journal articles aren't written for laypeople in the first place, and what they really need is better science reporting. 

No, and yet the public doesn't need to see the papers to know they must be wrong.

---

Anyway, Bill Nye, Neil deGrasse Tyson, enthusiasm for NASA funding (regardless of how much more science could be done with the same amount of money in NSF or NIH grants). That's good. They even think that they're being skeptical and scientific when they raise methodology concerns about new findings (whose evidence they haven't read). I guess that's nice, and it's true that good logic is good logic regardless of who says it. But what they don't understand is that science isn't a reddit thread, nor a democracy, and theories don't win by upvotes: there's an entire institutional structure of mercilessly and impersonally second-guessing each other's claims, but it's the best system we have and it works really well. By the time a result makes it through peer review into publication, the first thing you should guess isn't that the entire scientific establishment got it wrong.

",116,248,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wn1kl/meta_on_circlebroke_becoming_a_conservative/,"Hi Everybody. I initially brought this to the moderators but it was suggested I appeal to the community with a metapost.

I am presently concerned with the current overall state of the health of the circlebroke subreddit falling away from it's intended purpose. If you're here, with the average Redditor being somewhere to the left of Marx and about as politically aware as a potato that votes for the US Green party.

Having said that, extreme right thinking, complete lack of political awareness and reliance on memes/platitudes we've seen from the mainstream Reddit community. I want to remind everyone that /r/circlebroke is not /r/conservative or /r/libertarian or /r/republican. This is not the appropriate vehicle for your political beliefs.

Today, this is 'what you would expect from a left leaning community'. We should not be shocked that people think differently from us, we should be shocked when people think stupidly, and that's part of why this concerns me.

After the shooting the police took and destroyed the one piece of solid evidence. The response in the thread on circlebroke was overwhelmingly pro-cop, to the point of excess. As tired as I am of the anti-police circlejerk (you can see this consistently in my comment history) holy shit why would you pick this as your battle.

*** 

&gt;I think the point that free healthcare isn't free is a very valid one. Obviously it is taking money from one group of people to give to another group of people. It is essentially legalized stealing that is deemed OK as long as at least 50.00001% of people agree with the stealing.

Some of these threads are perfectly fine and contributing

On top of that, and certainly not circlebroke - the stylesheet even gives you a popup message telling you not to downvote because you disagree with somebody, but it is rampant in these political threads and it is becoming an increasing problem. ""Well, Bel_Marmaduk"", you say, ""Why not ignore political threads if you don't agree with circlebroke's political leanings?""

Because:

1. Ignoring a circlejerk counterintuitive to why anybody posts on /r/circlebroke
2. Because your politics threads are now taking up between 20 and 25% of the main page at all times.

12 of the top 50 posts are politics threads. That's nearly 1 in 4. It is simply not reasonable to avoid these threads. And unfortunately, which is just serving to chase people away from this SR.

First, but, unfortunately, it shows only posts from defaults and only posts that have a bunch of quick upvotes instead of front-page items.

Let's discuss the submission itself. I'm having a really hard time figuring out if this is a troll or an actual post. It seems like lately there's been an influx of “I'm not a member of this group, which the OP himself participates in throughout the thread. Let's look at his comments first.

--------------------------------------

**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**

--------------------------------------

^(*Disclaimer: I'm a relatively casual anime viewer.  I am not a longtime subscriber to /r/anime.*  ***Some links may contain spoilers.***)

**Imgurosity**: Deceptively low at first glance (36 of 50 frontpage posts are selfposts), parodies, or ""anime music videos"") and the occasional link to a blog/website.  The [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/z8q8i/i_would_just_like_to_take_this_moment_to_pay_my/) selfpost on the list is at #84, with a pandering but heartfelt ""thank you"" to amateur subtitlers that inexplicably sounds like a eulogy.  The [second](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14el3h/fuck_you_ranime/) is at #106 and is void of all worth.  The [third](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/16tggn/what_anime_do_you_regret_watching/) is miles down at #306, and the rest are presumably deep within the earth's core.

Let's take it a step further, and two just contain images anyway.  That leaves us with 14 selfposts in the top 1000.  Of course, this is to be expected of a large forum with a broad theme and somewhat lenient moderation.

I should reiterate that there *is* a rule against meme/macro/advice animal/etc posts, but perhaps they're satisfied with just using them in the comments, which is [far from uncommon](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/vxu59/yuruyuri_season_2_episode_1_discussion_spoilers/c58kirv).

**Discussion**: Decent or poor, an [analysis](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/15aor4/flcl_analysisepisode_1/) or [examination of themes](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17x8uo/princess_mononoke_anime_and_the_myth_of/), which are rare and not nearly as popular.  I'd attribute this to the fact that the focus of the main sub is too broad to foster discussion, but offshoot subreddits that focus on serious discussion (/r/trueanime, /r/japaneseanimation) are barren in comparison and show-specific subs don't fare much better.  /r/naruto, for example, has a noteworthy 17

Episode discussion threads tend to be better.  Some questionable voting habits aside (see below), themes, etc.  But all in all, the sub is largely geared towards [fun](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17hc6a/describe_your_favorite_anime_in_the_most_boring/), [simple](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/rfap5/dae_ever_get_really_sad_borderline_depressed_when/), [lighthearted](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/179fzk/who_is_your_favorite_female_character/) topics (again, this is to be expected).  That's not a negative thing in itself - not every discussion needs to be an academic seminar - though it would be nice to have some more intriguing conversations than ""fave character ever"" sometimes.

**Voting**: Pretty awful.  We've already seen how the top-scoring list looks, [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14cf3k/spoilers_chuunibyou_demo_koi_ga_shitai_episode_10/c7bulfu), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/177d8r/spoilers_kotourasan_episode_3_discussion/c82xx05), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/111xrr/sword_art_online_episode_14_discussion_spoilers/c6ipwmi), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/16cgbx/sasamisanganbaranai_episode_1_discussion_spoilers/c7uy619), [6](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11t6in/sword_art_online_episode_16_discussion_spoilers/c6pr3p7), [7](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11t6in/sword_art_online_episode_16_discussion_spoilers/c6pe4od), but it's pretty clear that oftentimes the top comments aren't exactly quality either ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/154437/spoilers_chuunibyou_demo_koi_ga_shitai_episode_12/c7j9l8f)

**Moderation**: Hard to say.  All mods are fairly active, memes, etc are handled with some reliability.  There doesn't seem to be much mod-userbase interaction (mod posts and organized events are rare, /r/metaanime is pretty vacant). *[Edit: people have pointed out that a lot of mod/user interaction takes place in the [IRC channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/izyre/join_us_in_our_irc_channel/).]*  The subreddit is probably too big to effectively police fighting words, voting habits, standards of effort, etc, but overall no glaring issues.

**Surprises**: I expected a lot more of two things: glorification of Japan, but not too bad overall.  I was pleasantly surprised by that. 

 

--------------------------------------

**JERKS

--------------------------------------

- [Subs rule

- ""Mainstream"" shows are often reviled - particularly Naruto and Bleach.  Ghibli films, Madoka Magica and FLCL are revered, though not without reason I suppose.

- The age-old reddit tradition persists: [self-congratulatory ""i love u guise"" thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/sani3/anime_changes_lives/).  We did it reddit!

- While meme *posts* are forbidden, and continues to happen [today](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17w5e7/i_want_to_thank_whoever_recommended_school_days/c89dao4?context=1).  Also, [""Endless Eight""](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11eu5p/i_just_watched_all_of_the_haruhis_endless_eight/) is literally worse than Auschwitz, amirite fellas??

- Criticism of subreddit-approved anime is generally not tolerated (see ""Voting"" above)

- Episode discussion threads sometimes become ""quote your favorite part"" threads, [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/vxu59/yuruyuri_season_2_episode_1_discussion_spoilers/c58kirv), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17nr1x/boku_wa_tomodachi_ga_sukunai_next_episode_4/c8778y0), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/177d8r/spoilers_kotourasan_episode_3_discussion/c82vqvx), [6](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17nr1x/boku_wa_tomodachi_ga_sukunai_next_episode_4/c876n7c)).  Screenshots and gifs are obviously also common.

- Requests for anime recommendations are [despised and buried](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=recommend&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all), so it seems like a mixed message to send.

Middling, and see some [cute gifs](http://booru.ehkzai.com/index.php?q=/image/13233.gif) or [cool fanart](http://i.imgur.com/Qf09g.jpg).  Don't expect too much analysis or weighty discussion; try not to disparage beloved shows and you'll be fine.

--------------------------------------

 

And so, as a [generic mascot character created solely for merchandising](http://imgur.com/UM2oBml) gleefully hopped behind us.  Father stood by the riverbank in his [battle mecha](http://imgur.com/LU2lqBr), facing us, as if he knew we would be coming.

    *My son.  Your gait is confident

    *But... but father-kun!  Only the chieftain of this village--*

1345613046.0,ymgl0,Why is reddit racist?,gfour,407,77,332,"   Reddit is racist. Incredibly racist. But that's nothing new. What I want to talk about is why. In almost every default sub, from rap music to ebonics. There was even a fucking AskReddit [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uzsr9/racist_redditors_what_makes_you_dislike_other/) asking people to share their racist opinions. And the racism isn't limited to blacks


Well
The long answer is incredibly complex, demographics, and ability to make excuses are all factors, and probably the most important ones.

The first reason that redditors are racist is because of the perceived anonymity of reddit. Reddit grants the ability for people to create a screen name, with so much pent up rage, can unleash it all with no fear of being judged. If you are a racist fuck and want to run around calling black people niggers, the internet is your destination. How well do you think someone calling their co-worker a ""stupid fucking nigger"" would fare in the workplace? Not very well, not very well at all. But on teh interwebz, there is no reputation to uphold. 

The second reason the mob mentality of reddit. What do you get when  a lot of opinionated people (with the same opinion) get together and pat each other on the back, but because the sheer number of redditors convinces others that their views are correct. This is the reason that gypsies are so unpopular on reddit, because people with no knowledge on the subject look at an anti-gypsy comment with 900 upvotes, and think ""*wow, could 900 people be wrong? Gypsies must be horrible people!""* 

The third reason that reddit is racist is becuase of demographics. The vast majority of Redditors are 15-25 year old male WASPs minus the protestant. Many of them live(d) sheltered lives in the suburbs, and music. When someone like that first has an experience with a different culture, the experience is probably quite jarring. ""People call this shit music?"" an especially *classy* neckbeard might say. ""I only listen to really deep stuff like queen"". The age range also happens to be the same group that loves edgy, offensive humor, which brings me to my next point.

The final and most important reason racism on reddit is so prevalent is because redditors are great at making excuses. [As it turns out

1346702090.0,zanht,The difference between a hivemind and a circlejerk. A lesson for the uninformed and the interested.,twentyone_21,404,80,120,"Today we will explore the proper differences between a hivemind and a circlejerk. There has been confusion lately between the two

*What is a hivemind?*  

**A hivemind is a group of people that express similar thoughts

*What is a circlejerk?*

**A circlejerk is a hivemind that lacks self-awareness.**

_____

Let's do some explaining:

* Semantically, a singular mind with many different voices of it, like a beehive is a single colony with many bees.  
This is not a necessarily bad thing. Hiveminds can actually be good! Some examples would be a bunch of people who are activists against human trafficking donating to a charity against that also.

* On the other hand, and how uncool you would be if you missed out. When you arrive, all you see is your friends wanking off, and you either join in on the creepy fun, or you notice how none of them realize how weird this is, and you leave their lack of self-awareness to themselves. Even if you told them that jerking off together/each other is really weird, they would tell you to just leave. They would tell you that what they are doing isn't weird

* There are a few points to emphasize in this analogy:  

 * As mentioned above
 * Within this absence of self-awareness
 * When alternate ideas are presented
 * There is always a superiority complex or a ""secret club"" mentality.  
 * Repeated content is usually upvoted (i.e. going around in a circle)
 * The denial that the circlejerk exists
 * It is different than what was advertised.  
 * It is very cyclical (no pun intended). The more self-validation there is
 * It is very hard to break the jerking of a circlejerk.

_____

*Comparing a Hivemind and a Circlejerk:

* As stated above
* A hivemind and a circlejerk can both do bad
* A hivemind and a circlejerk can both do good
* A hivemind and a circlejerk can both have superiority complexes

*Contrasting a Hivemind and a Circlejerk:

* As stated above
* Non-circlejerk hiveminds appreciate alternate opinions
* Non-circlejerk hiveminds do not act like an exclusive group. 
* Hiveminds can easily become circlejerks without proper moderation

_____

Here are some things that encourage circlejerks

* Victim complexes. These will encourage the ""secret club"" mentality
* Bias-strengthening. Usually this is done with poor strawmen and even fake arguments from a poorly-done ""devil's advocate"" position.  
* Low-quality content. It does nothing to help break the circlejerk.  
* Irrelevant content. Distracts regular lurkers from the problems within the community.  
* Stubbornness. Circlejerks generally do not encourage people to be free thinkers, as they will be more likely to disregard other ideas.  
* Dislike of change. Any changes to correct the circlejerk (usually by moderation) are generally resisted in circlejerks.  
* Laissez-faire moderation. The lack of authority figures increases low-quality and irrelevant content.  
* Self-congratulation. Taking credit for insignificant or irrelevant things
* Itself. The more self-validation and egotism presence

&gt;It seems a little clearer why so many followed him unconditionally.

Then came the Redditors we've come to know and fear.

&gt;Hitler could easily be the greatest leader of the 20th century and even a larger time frame.(Notice how i didn't say nicest or most humane).

&gt;This video has been uploaded to accurately document history. No political agenda is propagandised or supported via this uploading. There is absolutely no intention of some racist Flamewar to be instigated.

&gt;Objective, feared that the incredibly pursuasive rhetorical skill of Adolf Hitler will inflame support for his message. It is generally accepted that the media, also owned by Jewish circles, has actively kept the viewing public from access to accurate translations of Adolf Hitler's speeches.

&gt;Eradicating every single Jew is utterly atrocious an act

I should also point out that many people who notice this and blast the Youtube OP (possibly our beloved Reddit OP too) note that this guy has a picture of an Orthodox Jew for his icon and his location as Israel. I can't see an Israeli Jew posting comments like these

&gt;Hitler documentary: invariably with horror music in the background.
&gt;Jew-proganda all the way baby

&gt;I'm am Israeli. We created the Holocaust for our political and economic purposes. I've never disagreed with Hitler. He was right in his blaming Jews for the problems of Germany. Its just that his gang lost against my gang, is what would happen in the world's population would revolt against our power like the Germans did, let's say, in America. We would be slaughtered.

&gt;I just wish I had an adversary that was worth dying at the hands of. Westerners are so bereft of any morals, he is so soft and effeminate, I can just see a character like this being coaxed into submitting to anal penetration from his apparent wife whom has a strap on dildo.

Let's hear about some social norms that Redditors don't understand!

* [Everyone insisting on paying a dinner bill](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16vinw/what_social_norm_do_you_not_understand/c7zqpb9).

* [Thank you notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16vinw/what_social_norm_do_you_not_understand/c7zqmtk).  
This lack of comprehension particularly bothers me.  I don't send out thank-you notes to close friends, etc. (anyone I don't see often).  When someone has gone to the trouble to shop and buy (and sometimes ship) a gift for you, the least you could do is write a note to them.  Sure, you could say the same thing over text or email, but writing a note shows that you put thought into it.  It's a simple gesture of gratitude, but it says a lot.
* [Not swearing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16vinw/what_social_norm_do_you_not_understand/c7zqp68).

Here's the thing: People often come across very differently in person than they do on a resume.  Face-to-face time with an interviewer is important, communicative.  Plus, they want to know that you want the job.  Why would an employer hire someone who's indifferent?  
* [Sports chitchat](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16vinw/what_social_norm_do_you_not_understand/c7zqm0k).

First

&gt;It's called being an introvert

Two things here: first, however, a great indication that you, in thought and action, are probably an asshole.

Second, choose to then blame the other person for being concerned or uncomfortable when you are being unemotional.

It signifies a complete lack of respect and empathy for whomever is talking to you, not hate, as they say, is the opposite of love. Strange, then, that they might themselves feel a need to get clarity on the _why_ part, isn't it?

When someone approaches them and makes them feel ""uncomfortable

Then

&gt;Social ineptitude and introversion are not the same thing. Reddit needs to learn this.

To which is replied:

&gt;I am not socially inept

Bear in mind that this is the same guy who calls anyone who even remotely cares about why he's not having a huge grin on his face ""you fuck.""

He, or happy. Not just that, they mock them for it.

And I wonder, since people in general like happiness more than gloom (go figure), and since people normally take over emotions, be they friendly or hostile (a nifty thing called empathy), that just the simple act of these introverts exclaiming they are not unhappy or actually smiling once in a while just for the social decency of it all could resolve this entire situation without demonizing anyone else just because they care about others in the social situations that they're in.

No, we all know it's not. I am generally introverted, my friends are generally introverted, and many of them are autistic to boot. But none of these is sufficient reason for us to despise others when they try to include us in a social situation we position ourselves in.

Introversion is an absolutely pitiful excuse for their not caring about social protocol or other people. If they genuinely cared

Introversion is a matter of preference towards activity; it does not in any way compel you to behave like an asshole in a situation you will, if they just cast a polite smile at some random passerby's, they could see their whole world revolve -- really, it's quite pitiable. 

In conclusion

EDIT: Come to think... This may just be me, not by being unemotional and indifferent) that you're not really interested in talking with someone, they might actually not know this? And, conversely, doesn't it figure that, as a random example, when you don't express that you _do_ want to talk to someone

&gt;So basically the RIAA would have free reign to hack into people's computers to look for pirated movies.

I'm sure we're all shocked to discover that the crux of reddit's opposition to CISPA is it's interference with their right to pirate games and movies. Regardless

Now, they'd find that IP theft was specifically excluded from the bill. Now, I realize that it's a lot to ask for redditors to take 30 minutes out of their days filled with video games and porn, but I hoped that someone would at least skim the wiki page before responding.

Most Redditors, usually the top 5, in top posts.  I had to edit them a little to make them politically neutral but the message stays the same and it's remarkable how similar they are.

Here we go:

1)

&gt;Lowering tax rates to allow people to keep more of what they earn, what is really the objective, and the light went off for me when I saw it. It was just this week. A number of [The Enemy] are actually suggesting this. They're trying to be intellectually honest about it, or they're *trying* to sound intellectually honest.

2)

&gt;[The Enemy] are bothered by that as much as anything in American history bothers them: The success of the [cool president] years. It's a big threat. The success of the [cool president] years was one of the biggest threats [The Enemy] ever faced, and even while he was in office.

3)

&gt;It's very easy to undermine [The Enemy] because their entire platform is nothing but trendy talking point

4)

&gt;[The Enemy] has had a decades-long slippery definition of ""small business"" that's been used to jerry rig statistics and to bait-and-switch their base about whose interests their really protecting.

5)

&gt;Because [The Enemy] just can't help themselves. It's part of their dogma, more closely resembles a religion than a political ideology.

6)

&gt;There was no democratic uprising.  It was the Muslim Brotherhood uprising.  It was an Islamic supremacist uprising.  There was nothing democratic about it.  There was no democracy.  There was no liberty and freedom as we understand it.

7)

&gt;The Muslim mentality is not of peace and understanding, opinion and the outside world.

8)

&gt;Power equals wealth, compared to the population. The way you get into this club is usually via your university or your family legacy, family name, what have you.  Once you're in the club, the objective is to keep everybody else out of it. You don't want the club to grow. You don't want the clique getting bigger, and one of the quickest ways to keep people from becoming powerful is to make sure they don't become wealthy.

9)

&gt;[The Enemy] economic agenda in 11 words : ""Take from the middle

10)

&gt;I find it really stunning. We are going backwards in this country. We are separating people by class. We are separating people by race. We are not encouraging people to do better. We are not inspiring people to be the best they can be. We are essentially acknowledging that people are not very good and don't have much hope. Well, who they ought to try to eliminate, wipe out, in a political sense, and it's all based on race or other forms of ethnicity.

11)

&gt;Between their fiscal agenda mentioned here, I am more and more of the mind that [The Enemy] is the greatest threat, foreign or domestic, this country has ever faced.

In other words, making money or being more efficient (as any eKKKonomist will tell you).  No, evidently the whole reason that corporations exist is to _control_ you, what with all their rules and requirements.  Just like your parents.

But once the catnip of ""blame this on America"" has been scented, almost word-for-word, what a magical European has to say about it:

Still in the throes of an orgasm, she landed a flying elbow to my teeth and a textbook knee-strike to my vulnerable groinal region, the point of her patella making perfect contact with my left testicle, the larger and more handsome of the pair.

Ah, needless embellishments, and classic phrases such as ""my coital partner"". This man is truly the Hemingway of our time. Oh wait, no he's not, because Hemingway was a fantastic writer who understand that powerful yet simple language is often the most beautiful and effective way to communicate a story.

I’m what some people might call a ""geek"" or ""nerd."" Depending on who you ask

It can certainly be said that there has been a major societal shift in how people perceive nerds, where football jocks dominate the social hierarchy and nerds creep by under the radar to prevent being serially bullied (which is apparenly funny for some reason?). I have always despised this idea, because it is totally unrealistic. I am not saying bullying doesn't occur; it does. What I am saying is that the way in which it occurs is entirely different from the way most people imagining it as happening. There are instances where people are bullied for downright horrible reasons, and even when they aren't, no one deserves to be bullied. That being said, the people who tended to be shunned, in my experience, not asocial) behavior. I have never witnessed the ubiquitous anti-intellectualism that the hivemind claims to exist. 

The problem I speak of is the conflation of things which are arbitrarily associated with bookishness

I'm a rather introverted person, when they think of intelligent. The fact is, I have known incredibly intelligent people from all backgrounds who certainly do not fit into this category. Moreover, I have a lot of highly specific interests in relatively mundane areas, and several sort of quirks that might strike people as odd. All in all, I would consider the set of aspects which compose my identity as incidental. 

The social problem I have always had is not being bullied or belittled for being interested in science, sounds similar to myself (and others like me). It is someone with a set of very focused interests which have a significant effect on their day to day lives. The critical difference between whatever one might call me, and geeks, is that geeky interests are devoid of any intellectual merit. Now before I go on, I don't mean to sound elitist. There are plently of people with intellectually fruitful interests. All I am saying is that my sort of personality tends to be lumped in with a geeky personality. So, just to give examples, let's compare geeky and non-geeky hobbies. A good example of a non-geeky hobby would be something like being involved in amateur radio. I'm not a ham, actually, but they are not a lifestyle for me. The difference between ham radio and video games as lifestyles are that the latter does not impart genuine

People on reddit love to tout themselves are superior to the unwashed masses, Fifty Shades of Grey or Harry Potter. My tastes in recreation do not resemble what the average person likes, but I don't think myself better for that. 

So why am I ranting? What bothers me, or whatever other music the hivemind likes. I don't find ""nerdy"" humour, that requires all of a wikipedia page to ""get,"" funny in the slightest. I hate anime. I think RPGs are almost entirely composed of trite, horrible, cliche storylines. I think Joss Whedon is a hack, and that Firefly has subpar acting and a half-assed premise that makes absolutely zero sense. I think Game of Thrones is glorified pornography with a bunch of superficially ""complex"" plot lines are overwrought language so neckbeards can get off and feel superior at the same time. I hate people whose knowledge of physics come from Star Trek who spam science blogs about ""ramping up production of carbon metamaterials."" I think transhumanism is pseudo-scientific nonsense that is nothing more than a surrogate for the rapture for internet atheists. I take pride in being presentable (i.e. not having cheetos dust on my fingers) and hygiene.

Redditors fancy themselves scientists, or bragging about your 140 IQ you got from an online test. It's not being a facebook warrior against fundie friendzoners. It's *definitely* not getting high on marijuana. I spend my time pouring through books that are, I'll be honest, boring as hell most of the time. Sometime I have to read a paragraph 20 times before I have any idea what's even going on. The great physicist Richard Feynman said this in reference specifically to quantum mechanics, but I think it also applies more generally: if you think you understand science, you don't understand science. I question whether this is what I want to do nearly every day. I keep on, because it's worth it all for those brief,"" and likely never will.

Take this post for instance:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10xex9/reddit_as_a_black_man_who_wants_to_be_part_of/

For a little while it broke just over a 1000 net upvotes, tries to brush it off with some simplistic statements basically saying 'oh that is just the way it is'. My [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10xex9/reddit_as_a_black_man_who_wants_to_be_part_of/c6hht0j?context=3) to them explores some real issues that may be contributing to the racist environment reddit fosters, which they didn't address, and didn't respond to. Now in my comment there is a great video about White Privilege that I think every person should watch.

Why would reddit highly upvote something about black people confirming stereotypes, that we don't care because we don't have to deal with it every day. We don't care because we don't have to. The reality of what others go through in life or have to face isn't our reality, in this sense we are privileged because we don't have to experience racial prejudice both in the real world or online.

How does this fit together with /r/creepyPMs?

Well, or whatever other excuse confirms their biased outlook on the world. Yet when a woman did the same thing back, they were batshit crazy. Don't stick your dick in that. Whoa boy! You sure dodged a bullet. The sentiment that there was nothing wrong with these creeps got so bad that a small portion of the users started fighting back against people posting content for us. 

They were bitches, links to their pictures posted. If they posted on /r/gonewild, they should have known better. If they posted in /r/amiugly they deserved to get these creepy messages because it comes with the territory of compliments. I created a rule, rule 7 which asks that any questioning if something is creepy be explored on another subreddit. A small group of people were extremely offended that their opinion wasn't valued, that mindlessly saying something isn't creepy doesn't really add any value to our subreddit.

Take a look through some of the posts there. It has gotten a little better over the past month, or attractive. They get upvoted, and highly! 

Some guy offers you money for your used underwear

This speaks to the dynamic in which reddit interacts with people different than them. For women, and then we want to have power over them by telling them how disgusting, slutty, whorish, and wrong they are for being sexually liberated. We in essence despise ourselves for being so attracted to women, and instead of exploring this disgust, we project it onto the women.

Suddenly karma becomes more important than human relationships. People are trying to trick us or brainwash us into giving them karma, experience, or feel it, it isn't real to us. The only thing real to us is our confirmation bias and anything that affirms it.

This is why it's so easy for people on reddit to identify with being oppressed when it focuses on something that they have experienced. Oppressed or stereotyped against because you are atheist? Those horrible people don't know how hard we have it! Muslims oppressed because of xenophobia? Religious extremists! It's easy to see why oppression can affect us, it simply can't be digested by us because we have no reference for it. We could look past our own nose and see the similarities in various forms of oppression, but that would mean looking outside our bubble of a world view and questioning ideas and views we have held to be true and have been cemented in our minds by our peers who agree with us. 

So that black man post in askreddit? No one can adequately explain why reddit is as racist as it is because from our perspective we don't see it as racist. We see it as a psychological issue, but the rest of the comments aren't much better. 

The posts in /r/creepyPMs when we don't see them as conforming to our exact ideas of creepy? No one can adequately understand how the other person feels, but I haven't let it completely warp my views on life. 

To redditors, sexism, or anything else because of free speech. But do you honestly think this free speech would extend to a subreddit that was fighting against something they were passionate about? What if industry and government created a PRO SOPA subreddit, and spread their message to the rest of reddit. Would we be fighting as hard for this free speech? I hardly think so. We fight for free speech, for rights, for issues to be visible and discussed only because they are something important to us. When we see no importance in an issue, it becomes meaningless. It becomes insignificant. Sometimes we will even take up arms against it because we don't understand it. Our complete lack of passion is the driving force to maintain our confirmation bias. For some people, their ideas

It would require individuality, when it's easier believing in what we always have believed in. Because it's safe, it's comfortable, and it doesn't require any work on our part. Reddit and other sources of peer supported false realities makes people lazy, it makes them resort to comfortable ideas, and it keeps them from waking up to the world around them. 

This is why certain posts make it to the front page, or singled out because of their gender, or poor young white men being disillusioned being on the front page, you know there is some other important issue that will never fully receive the visibility it desires because to the main demographics of reddit, it doesn't matter.

So why then, easily explain away the issue, or turn it back on the other person? It removes responsibility. Reddit isn't racist if that's just how basic psychology works. Men aren't creepy if the woman was baiting them in with their pictures or using our sexuality against us. It removes putting the responsibility on the people it should be on. It removes personal responsibility, something no one will want to deal with as long as there is a scapegoat to pass the buck onto. ",,False,,False,t3_111gau

1374104232.0,1iisx4,An Explanation of how /r/adviceanimals got to be so terrible,LeMayMayPoster,310,40,82,"Hi

Advice Animals, which first appeared on the Internet in 2006. There was never one ""right way"" to do them, but most versions of the meme involved juxtaposing incredibly terrible advice with the picture of a smiling dog. Many earlier spinoffs, like Courage Wolf, followed a similar pattern. By the way, this is why they're called Advice Animals--they actually involved some sort of advice. You can spot an attempt to revitalize this idea with Actual Advice Mallard, although it fails at giving ridiculous advice. By contrast, no Advice Animals concept ever just goes away--but they do become less prominent.

Let's end by looking at an Advice Animal from this era:

http://imgur.com/XCO9Ex6

This first era lasted from 2006 to 2010

Here's where we hit what I think of as the second wave of Advice Animals. This wave can be divided into two distinct camps. The main thing they had in common was a disregard for ""advice, as the use of both advice and animals declined.

Let's dub one of these camps the Rage Revolution. This is where, they migrated to image macro form. RR-era macros are distinct in that they could easily be rewritten as rage comics. Scumbag Steve, Socially Awkward Penguin, and so forth fit into this category. Additionally, some macros of this era actually depict rage comic characters, like the Forever Alone Guy. Overall, RR-era macros are used to share stories from a person's life. This may include something they did, and so on. This movement began in 2010 or so, look at this asshole!"" or ""This is how to be a Good Guy/Good Girl

Let's look at a Rage Revolution macro:

http://imgur.com/FPJUENL

Concurrent with the Rage Revolution were the XD SO RANDOM Syncretists, but not all memes are image macros). It was their belief that putting Impact text on any type of joke or message made it a proper Advice Animal. This allowed anything to be rendered in the image macro format. This era's explanation is simple--for example, a single anti-joke might not far on /r/funny, but slap a chicken on it and it's an Advice Animal. This movement retained the XD SO RANDOMness of the original Advice Animal concept, while expanding its scope so that actual advice was no longer necessary, actual animals were no longer necessary, and a fixed format was no longer necessary, even the XD SO RANDOM syncretists would balk at the third wave

But first

http://imgur.com/kVy72nP

Neither of those two macro types have completely faded from use, which began some late in 2011 and came to maximum prominence by 2012. This is the Brave Wave. Examples include Confession Bear, Grinds My Gears, Pepperidge Farm Remembers, Am I the Only One, Sudden Clarity Clarence, Morpheus, while borrowing the XD SO RANDOM Syncretists' broad view of the Advice Animals concept. They all express this basic message: ""I have an important opinion

This is also when it abandoned the actual structure of Advice Animals. By the Syncretists' reckoning, by contrast, are often divided arbitrarily. There is often no buildup of expectations, no unexpected payoff or expansion of the first section. Literally the only thing making it an Advice Animal is the familiar, repeated format. For example, in a ""Grinds My Gears"" post, the only humor is in ""Heh,"" or ""Heh

Here's our last analysis

You can read all kinds of mind-numbing nonsense about witnessing the birth of the Universe, or making you understand science (I wish I was kidding). Oh but it's true! Kary Mullis says LSD helped him discover PCR. Oh wait, he's an AIDS denialist and thinks Astrology has something to it. Nevermind. I can't even fathom how that would work. Maybe I'm wrong, or anyone for that matter, this comment and the thread are so stupid I don't know where to begin. For example,"" never anything specific) just want to keep you down!

As a side note

It would seem the [MRAs](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c6py0) are out in full force [today](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c62kr). On the first, it speaks volumes that redditors are willing to upvote something they can't prove and more importantly probably have no experience with. It's yet another example of the ""wimmenz be bitchez"" thing on this site. The second is just ""friendzoned"" in so many other words. Peripherally [related](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c851w) is this pandering story. The story itself is not so much the problem as the manner in which it is told. I know the sort of thing the guy was going for, and reddit *eats* that shit up, that overly aggressive, ironically angry type of humour that most people stop finding funny past 12. Also the ""HAHA I CAN RELATED BECAUSE I'VE HAD SEX GAIZ"" too thing.

[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c7wxt_) and [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c5au1) are bad because they are two of the more egregious examples of pseudo-science I have seen on this site. The first, ""golden ration woo."" It saddens me that the word fractal has been so debased.

Lastly
[Every action and decision we make is influenced by the sum of our experiences, memories, influences etc of those people. Doesn't that at some level make everything kind of predictable if we were able to map every single influence?On a related note, if every decision we make is influenced by things in our past, most of which were beyond our control, what does that say about free will?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c5v0e)

First of all, a computer smaller than the Universe cannot compute a complete simulation of the entire Universe, making the argument null. Also there's this little bitty problem called complexity theory which means that some problems could never be solved within a finite amount of time anyway, just saying. Somehow though, our brave scholar, receives Reddit Gold for this. Why? Because it perfectly panders to just the sort of bullshit quasi-empiricist sort of mentality that Reddit has. It's phenomenon called ""scientism."" And it's just, as I said, along with a few others who cite Sam Harris. Sam Harris is a hack philosopher of the first degree, Daniel Dennet makes a very, the spinning of an old idea as one's own as if it were original or insightful in anway

So basically

So... basically you're not very bright?

Sitting at +330 we have:

&gt;I was never described as ""gifted"" but I never put any effort in because I was smart enough without trying. I'm now at uni and I'm lazy as fuck and don't really know how to study.

How do you not know how to study? Seriously?

Sitting at +81 we have:

&gt;I have actually asked friends how to study becasue I don't understand it. I actually spent my study time for mid terms looking up how to study for midterms. I feel so left out because I used to just have to sit there to get good at the class but now I'm kinda slacking because I don't know what to do.

Wow...... I give up.

I have a theory that e-hipsters enjoy using said currency with the hopes and dreams that one day they will be denied using it somewhere and they can clear their throat, ambivalent 16 year old. 

I speculate this because once upon a time (A growing ""once upon a time

Every once in a while I'd get a customer come up to the counter and order, do you have any $1s or $5s?""

Meanwhile

Anyway

&gt;Same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago. The cashier even said ""sir I'm going to have to ask you to leave now."" I confused asked why and then he promptly replies with this gem ""the money sir. Do I have to call the police?"" smh people these days 

And in response to that: 

&gt;Haha, and the manager would rip them a new one. 

.

&gt; I say this in all seriousness- your response should have been yes. People being publicly humiliated for their stupidity teaches them to not be stupid pretty goddamned quick.

. 

&gt; It's shit like this that makes it so hard to explain in a foreign country that Americans are really very friendly

That one managed to sneak in an anti-American rant. Good for him. 

&gt;I hate how fucking stupid so many people are now. 

. 

&gt;How stupid are cashiers these days? 

Further testing the theory:  

&gt;I had this experience with trying to pay with a gold coin a year or two after they came out at Best Buy. I couldn't believe it. 

. 

&gt; what moron refuses to accept gold? i hope he was fired on the spot when you complained to the manager...

. 

&gt; I really hope you called him/her a stupid cunt. 

. 

&gt; Whenever I use a $2

. 

&gt; This post just made me rage at ignorance. I'd have made the cashier call a bank just to make them look stupid. 

. 

&gt;I bought a phone case from verizon and used a few two dollar bills.. The cashier was like ""are you serious? What is this?"" I just pointed to the ""Legal for all debts public and private"" and he accepted them... Douche. 

. 

&gt;Refuse to pay with anything else

. 

&gt; A barista thought I was putting Chuck E Cheese coins in the tip jar the other day when I used a Sacagawea. 

. 

&gt;I was about to make comments about the Susan B. Anthony dollar coins. I can't remember if it was the Sacagawea coin or the SBA dollar that made a cashier get a manager to ask if I could use that to pay. That took 20 minutes longer than I wanted to be in a Wal~Mart.

. 

&gt; She won't

. 

&gt; It's not your fault shes retarded...
 

Slightly different but in the same style: 

&gt; A year ago I tried paying for some clothes using a 1988 hundred dollar bill at a Gap store and the cashier, refused to take the bill. Apparently she had never seen the old style American C-Note, nevertheless, it's still valid currency.

&gt; Is it because framing something as a war makes it more understandable to the average American? Is it just one giant misnomer?


Note that the question takes as given the premise that this is an American phenomenon, the top comments include le gems such as:

&gt; **In America**

And of course

&gt; War is a rallying cry

not to mention:

&gt; There are 2 things **Americans** love: War and Hyperbole.

Of course, the metaphor of war to describe a metaphorical battle is an ancient one.

Now, let's look at some recent ""Wars"" in Canada:

* Toronto Mayor Rob Ford launched a [War on Graffiti](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/08/27/toronto-graffiti-war.html).

* Canada has also adopted the phrasing of the [War on Drugs](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/04/15/pol-milewski-harper-war-on-drugs.html).

* Canadians don't have the War on Christmas

From the rest of the world:

* Pakistan has declared [war on polio](http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-5-150344-Govt-urged-to-intensify-war-on-polio).

* In Kenya

Those aside, this is the single most arrogant I've ever heard someone say about Reddit.

I'm asking this because I fear that CB could become too much like them. Don't get me wrong, no one was justifying the use of the word, but rather arguing why removing the word wasn't needed. Of course, SRS got on the bandwagon, because apparently mere mention of the word in a neutral context is bad. 

Another thing I've noticed lately is hints of reverse bullying here. For example, but I think it's kind of unfair to essentially call everyone commenting losers because they didn't have/want facebook.

I guess my concern in a nutshell is that CB should be about the discussion of circlejerks, take for example the rape thread in AskReddit. While yes, the rape apologists were horrible. I don't see how the idea of the thread itself was wrong. I am of course against people defending rapists, but I don't think the discussion of occurrences of rape is intrinsically bad. The thing that bothers me about SRS is that they seem to think discussion of a topic implies endorsement. If I were discussing the arguments employed by slaveholders before the Civil War, that does not mean I support slavery or agree with those arguments. Now I know that there are a LOT of people who do defend rather disgusting viewpoints. SRS doesn't seem to be able to distinguish between the two. Let's not become that.

One thing I DO love about CB is that people here are generally pretty good about not just silencing dissenting opinions. So

It's best not to be too harsh here - lots of people have similar thoughts as teenagers (especially regarding school being 'useless,') it's the shameless advocacy of cheating that's getting me. Yes, tests aren't great, but you're not entitled to everything without any work. I suspect this is just another facet of the brogressive 'entitlement' mentality, the same mindset found in /r/politics.

Sitting at home eating Dorritos and playing Starcraft (or writing circlebroke posts at 1am,) doesn't entitle you to an A, a good GPA, or a good job. You need to work hard for those things - something which people in the /r/teenagers thread don't understand (or don't want to understand.)

There's also a [strain of thought](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/1cd53e/um_how_is_this_atheism_how_does_this_have_1400/c9fibxo) that tests are a barrier that represses someone's true creative potential or 'genius.' [See here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cc4db/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself/c9f3mkx). Learning takes work - often hard work, but you're not entitled to an A just because you're smart. 

In /r/libertarian, the idea that formal education beyond lower secondary education is worthless, because you can teach yourself everything from the Internet. This usually involves a person in later secondary education/early college bemoaning the uselessness of their English or Social Studies class when they can teach themselves everything they need to know from Wikipedia and a programming textbook. The best example I've seen was a guy who wanted to drop out of grade 10 (~15 years old,) to pursue *game development* full time.

This jerk has interested me for a while, especially teachers and professors. Why would I bother to learn from a teacher when I'm smarter then them? Second, there's also an element of a [misunderstood genius](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15s60l/anatomy_of_a_circlejerk_or_a_grand_unified_theory/) who is *too good* for the school system. 

Finally, I think it relates back to the 'brilliant but lazy' and 'misunderstood genius' entitlement that goes around Reddit. Redditors want the appearance of being intelligent without putting in the work. I've found that *actual* smart people tend to be rather modest about their intelligence, it's those who are insecure about it who are the loudest in proclaiming how much of a genius they are.",Quality Post,False,,t5_2tnz9,starflair,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1d7v6z/reddits_attitude_to_education_or_the/

Now this TIL post is about gender equality

Makes sense to me.

&gt;I think it reveals that they are not as egalitarian as they think they are.

Feminists are trying to oppress men and Lance_lake is fighting the good fight against them.

&gt;Feminists (most of them that I met) aren't looking for equality. They want to have more benefits then men and that is not something I will fight for.

I hate it when people use gay rights as a tool to acheive their own goals. Like when /r/atheism use gay rights only to bash religion.

This Redditor personally doesn't dislike Ladies' Night

&gt;I think it's the gays who have a problem with this? Can someone who is gay voice their opinion. I know you're out there. not trying to bash

Gay bars

&gt;i know it sounds weird, the women would be so revved up by the strippers that it would be child's play to go in as a straight guy and clean up...at least that's what I've heard

A bunch of heteros get offended when someone tells them it's rude for straight guys to pick up women.

&gt;Why? I don't find it rude if a gay guy comes into a ""normal"" bar to pick up men. Why should it be any different the other way round?

.
&gt;Is it rude to the 'heteros' if a man picks up a man in their 'hetero' bar?

Obviously these guys don't know how embarrassing it is to mistake someone for being gay or having some dude get highly offended and try to kick your ass because you said his eyes were beautiful.

&gt;The fuck? So a gay bar should only be for gay people. Something tells me this wouldn't go over well if someone tried to open a ""hetero bar"".

All nonspecific bars are pretty much hetero bars imo

So long /r/philosophy, it's getting high!

Some le gems from the thread:

&gt;Perhaps simply the fact that the sort of people attracted to philosophy are more likely to disregard societal prohibitions unless a good argument for them is presented.

While this statement isn't *wrong* it bothers me in that it is obvious the commenter is posturing him or herself as an exemplar of this. DAE drugs = misunderstood genius

&gt;Or are looking to expand their field of perception in a variety of different ways - reading, whatever...

Doing drugs is literally the same as reading guys

&gt;Plus, epiphanies, etc. Drugs can be powerful tools for the user who looks beyond the recreational purpose of a substance.Denying yourself this opportunity based on mainstream arguments is silly, there is a whole other world out there.

Wow

BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!

&gt;Not just one other world in fact but an infinite number of universes - each perceptual reality a chosen illusion. So I would say philosophy students know that they are perceiving an illusion and elect to chose the illusion they perceive instead of letting society download one de facto. In fact I would argue that is true of any thinker - student in a formal sense or otherwise. Again while honoring temperance I think prohibition only pollutes minds. Wait a minute I gotta go or I will miss my spot in the rotation snicker.

Oh my god

&gt;We tend to be more away of moral corruption in the legal system and more willing to challenge preconceived notions as well.

Drugs being illegal is definitely moral corruption from the man just trying to bring these brave sci[ENT]ists down. Because

&gt;Undergraduate philosophy students do drugs because they want to. Graduate philosophy students do drugs because they need to. 

2deep4me. Yeah

&gt;Getting high with philosophers can be fun - especially the ones who are really smart and don't get high very often. Their epiphanies tend to be more interesting than ordinary folks and sometimes they will spontaneously grok something some philosopher said that they never understood when they were in class. 
 
ugh.

&gt;When I was going for my bachelors degree in philosophy, with more than a few having just taken their intro to philosophy and a few that hadn't had that. I came in early one day, having just rolled out of bed at the crack of noon thirty, rather hung over from a party the previous night. I left the lights off and made my way to the back of the class where my desk was, pulling my hood up over my head and letting the cool surface of the wood caress my cheek. Not five minutes goes by and a small chorus of cackling freshman come in, blathering on about whatever shiny things have recently caught their fancy. They immediately turn the lights on, thus adding to my misery. After about ten minutes of their inane banter, in some almost sure to be fruitless attempt at quieting them. ""You really want to know why all the icons of philosophy are substance abusers?"", the more people become absolutely intolerable."" I put my head down. They dropped their conversations for the next few minutes until class started. Regardless of whether or not I was correct

Oh god! The smug! It buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrns. Nice use of the thesaurus though.

&gt;I met my coke dealer in a Philosophy class in college who was a Philosophy major

I'll take 'Shit That Never Happened' for $500 Alex.

&gt;I've actually found it harder to do drugs after I was introduced to philosophy. You see the world in a completely different way when you're introduced to some of these ideas and drugs (pot in my case) just magnify these ideas to extreme levels for me. Granted, I forgot toilet paper at the grocery store"" to ""I am a something living on a rock orbiting a star that takes in photons and air vibrations and I am living a finite life"". As I type that second part out now (being sober), it doesn't phase me. But high? Oh Christ. Kudos to you folks that can read Kant and drop acid. I'll stick with my alcohol, thanks.

WOAH! SPACE IS LIKE BIIIIIIG MAN!

&gt;Sometimes you have to smash your continuity of self temporarily to become a stronger continuity in general. To have a strong sense of self is never the same as thinking you are what you are

I would criticize this statement if it actually meant anything at all.

Now

&gt;While it is true certain drugs can be very interesting experiences, for anyone that does any kind of self reflection or occasional naval gazing the drugs do nothing special aside from clouding and confusing your own thoughts making anything you think at the time seem ""wise"" and ""far out man"". I have nothing against drugs or their users (that would be rather hypocritical of me) but people who so highly rate psychedelic experiences clearly were never very self aware people to begin with.

Now

&gt;With all due respect I think your analysis is terribly generalized, would absolutely disagree. Whether or not you have had these experiences I do not know, but to say, it seems ""wise"" or ""far out"" at the time leads me to the assumption you haven't experienced a full blown psychedelic experience. One that dissolves the ego, and destroys your perception of the self. NOT one that makes you more self aware. The idea is to go BEYOND the self. The level of introspection I'm talking about here isn't one obtained with low dose drugs where you can walk around happily glaring at colorful pictures or attending a rock concert. I'm talking about ones that lay you out on a bed for hours, destroy space and time, and engulf you in other worlds. VICE just did a piece on Iboga and addicts. If you can, ""oh far out, and yet, life

Oh my god, introspection. Yeah, that's not what philosophy is. It's not thinking about how ""awesome things are man."" Jesus.

&gt;Well put. While you are saying that psychedelics aren't a requirement

Wow


&gt;""how useful are they for gaining knowledge of true reality?"" Such a thing exists?

Oh god

&gt;What makes so you convinved that the reality you perceive when sober is the true reality, suppose I thought it was natural for the drinking age to be 21, but after visiting France, I know, from experience, that a drinking age need not be 21. Its not that you can't breakdown your assumptions and your presuppositions through rigorous analysis; you can. But drugs, in providing such radically different experiences (where, you feel good and belonging and adventurous), I find the mere fact that with some small chemical doses can immensely change the feel and organization of my consciousness incredibly interesting. Nagel asks, on some acid?'

Is this guy fucking serious? Well we can at least be certain that there is no way *in hell* that he's an actual academic philosopher.

Maybe a bit much, so they're obviously no strangers to responding to ads in this way.

But wait just a cotton-picking, the commercial is explicitly directed at (and admiring of) the American farmer class, which has been a considerably significant factor in the country's success and general character for the entirety of its existence.  But what good are farmers to STEMmy IT drones who know so much better?  Can't Amerikkka see it's being duped?  Don't they know propaganda when they see it?

This is one of those rare instances when I give Reddit the benefit of the doubt. My own feelings about Reddit and Jews have been thoroughly recorded in my comment history

The picture is in celebration of Diwali, the OP left a brief history of the holiday:

&gt;Link to wikipedia page about Swastika

&gt;EDIT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali

&gt;Diwali marks the return of Rama

Great! It's always nice to celebrate other cultures and gives a little bit of context for the confused and curious. The OP left links to the history of Diwali and the swastika for anyone who wanted to probe deeper. Oh, they are now.

Overall, I'm still searching for my first Diwali reference other than the OP's comment.

Now, to pretend the two weren't related would be even worse. But the manner in which Reddit decides to handle this delicate subject is nothing if not irresponsible.

The first comment in response to the OP starts the ball rolling:

&gt;I'm glad to see that there are others ""in the know"" all up in these here parts.

&gt;Peace

...And the floodgates open. Suddenly

&gt;Ahhh... The swastika. A sign of peace and hope. Well until the nazis stole it. [+84]

Retorts another commenter:

&gt;It's still a sign of peace and hope. [+61]

Surely this last commenter was in a time-crunch. That would explain the lack of a clause expressing how someone might view a swastika in another light

&gt;Think of it as a great opportunity to educate. Every time someone new learns about it

Well

&gt;Does anyone else think it's about time to start a movement to reclaim the swastika back from it's modern history? [+76]

and

&gt;Kinda sucks hard how the nazis ruined the swastika for the world

and

&gt;It's high time that symbol reverted to its rightful ownership. [+376]

and

&gt;Of course the OP chose the potentially controversial pic

and

&gt;Not choosing to use the swastika in the specific photo could also be seen as confirming the Nazi appropriation of the symbol. It's a no win

and

&gt;did u kno dat the nazis usd this symbol 4 there flags? nazis r bad... lik dis if u crai... evertim [+193]

...are all merely samples of the hundreds of comments that attempt to explain or justify its usage here. But hey

&gt;...the 'heil Hitler'-salute. Like

For the sake of this post,"" who knew it was ""Goering to happen,"" because Hitler wasn't so bad—after all, he killed Hitler! But I assure you, all of those comments are there. All in a thread that is purportedly about Diwali.

So there you have it. I'm complaining about a full thread of comments with which I don't disagree, Islamophobic, homophobic, anti-religious, anti-Semitic, and bigoted in so many other ways has finally grown a conscience just in time for Diwali. Just in time to rally around the common cause of reclaiming an historical symbol with deep Hindu ties. Or maybe it's just that Reddit is a group that likes to point out that they already knew that fact, or that it's a group that likes the way it feels when it talks positively about swastikas. Your guess is as good as mine.

In the name of thread completion

&gt;Every single fucking comment on here consists of

&gt;""hurr durr it's not Nazis!""

&gt;We ALL know that. Every fucking 12 year old kid hears from their random-facts-laden friend that swastikas are ok because Hitler didn't invent them.

&gt;Shut the fuck up about it. We know. [+136]

For the people that missed it, make a sparkly trail follow their mouse, etc.

A number of subreddits also chose to do their own April Fools pranks.

/r/imgoingtohellforthis put up a fake ban page

/r/askhistorians implemented a bunch of new rules that they knew would piss people off like ""no more WW2 questions"" and ""we'll be allowing in certain types of jokes and memes due to popular demand""

/r/subredditdrama merged with SRSsucks (as if it hasn't already

/r/asoiaf pulled a multi-day prank that brought [a bit of an uproar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bgwja/and_in_the_category_of_april_fools_drama_i_offer/)

and there were plenty more.  

I've seen some back and forth on the pranks.  The /r/askhistorians one was the first one I saw and I'll admit they got me.  After that, and it *was* funny seeing a lot of people get fooled and angry about the sub changes (or happy in the case of imgoingtohellforthis being ""banned"".)  

What got me thinking about this post was the admin's prank though.  Personally, and comments getting obliterated made the comment section in a lot of subs unreadable, but on the whole, I thought it was a funny prank, that apparently brought [in more traffic than Reddit has ever seen in one day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1bgkpv/how_will_we_look_at_april_1_2013_on_reddit_in_the/c96r05u)  I liked the randomness and the inventory items, and felt it was a nice change of pace from what we see on Reddit the other 364 days a year.

I've seen a lot of popular complaints about it though.

* That it's proof the admins don't care about Reddit anymore and only want to see traffic and jokes.

* That it started a war between Redditors instead of focusing on other sites like Digg and 9gag.

* That it completely destroyed good discussion and it's ridiculous that people would have to wait a day to talk about things.

* That it started a slippery slope that Reddit isn't going to recover from.

* That it was annoying because of the lack of instructions

This was an April Fools prank.  It's the one day out of the year that this kind of thing is *expected* to happen.  Hell, most people will forget about it in a few days unless it's brought up again.  It would have been nice if there was an option to turn it off, but pranks are *supposed* to be disruptive.  I think it just goes back to the amount of time people invest into this website.  They start to look at it like they're stockholders and that Reddit disappointed them with their unfunny and intrusive joke.

**Welcome to the world of monetization through factionalism**. This is one of the few times I can honestly say I'm impressed with Reddit.

Think about it, and CB/CJ (and the dust ups we all get into with each other everywhere ) bring lots of traffic and engagement to Reddit, but that alone doesn't make Reddit money. The same thing goes for the ideological flash points that arise from or are exacerbated by these metacoms (and the larger Reddit community as a whole): free speech, pedophiles/ephebophiles, feminism, men's rights, atheism, rape, memes

All these things produce a lot of traffic, but lots of folks visit Reddit on mobile clients or they use adblocking software. And outside of vote counts, it's all really passive and opaque to the userbase; ad revenue doesn't feed back to the user base and encourage more engagement.

This is where most sites kinda just sit back or introduce weak premium subscriptions. Reddit started this with Reddit Gold and I thought that would be it, they went and did something remarkable.

**They created a way to tap directly into a flashpoint or circlejerk and give people the option to go beyond merely upvoting something they really ~~agree with~~ think contributes to conversation.**

After a few years of really training people to engage with Reddit through voting on what they ~~agree/disagree with~~ think contributes to the conversation, this explicitlly announces to the rest of the community that this comment just got your ""super support"". Moreover, it also can't be neutralized by a downvote.

And of course

This especially holds true for topics that have a lot of social friction/drama to them

Of course, but it's clear from looking at either what often gets upvoted on Reddit or the comments that get gilded that binary feedback mechanisms can be subconsciously co-opted and used in many different ways.

That isn't to say that comments made in circlejerks or flashpoints can't be high quality or that what I'm talking about holds true for the majority of gilded comments; I'm just saying that these binary feedback mechanisms can also be co-opted to reward and encourage comments in circlejerks/flashpoints that aren't necessarily high quality.

I simply found [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/13hs4e/mitt_romney_at_my_local_gas_station_he_looks/) to be pretty appalling. Look, like a people!

While there is undoubtedly a certain peculiarity in the contrast from pre-election Romney to ""washed up"" Romney (what a fucking thing to say - is every man who pumps his own gas washed up now? Is not having your hair combed and your face covered in make-up being washed up?)

The thing that makes this painful for me, but that even now they can't cut him a break ([LOLOL POOR GUY I BET HE CRIES INTO C-NOTES WHAT A FUCKING 1%ER](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/13hs4e/mitt_romney_at_my_local_gas_station_he_looks/c744lsu)), and those who try to are called out for flip-flopping, being typical Redditors who support the ""underdog"" regardless of principles (nevermind that Romney was *always* the ""underdog"" in this race, and Reddit sure as shit didn't support him then). 

The very top comment is great, is quick to point out that Romney has money, so obviously doesn't deserve any sympathy or to be treated like a decent human being. After that person is called out, a British person (presumably) comes out swinging about why anyone on Reddit should suddenly find anything not-atrocious about the man. ""HEY GUISE, I THOUGHT WE HATED LITERALLY MITTLER?""

While the jerk goes both ways here - there are plenty of voices calling the OP out for being obnoxious - I feel that the Romney-has-money-so-doesn't-deserve-respect thing to definitely be the overwhelming trend of this thread, there's some cause for hyperbolic rhetoric, I guess, sure. But now? Just let it go. It's not funny to point out that rich people are rich. It's not clever, it's not politically advantageous, it's not righteous or superior.

&gt;""He made his own bed getting to where he is

What the fuck does that even mean? He has to continue living the same life every other American lives? And he deserves it

&gt;""I guess it's hard to be sympathetic in light of the fact that, his recent comments weren't intended to be public, but it's hard to see someone in the role of victim when they're making comments like the ones he has post-election-night."" 

Where are these opinions coming from, so of course he's sub-human for the rest of his life, and if you dare to treat him with even a shred of sympathy or respect, you are a flip-flopping neocon who doesn't deserve the liberal beauty of Reddit.

&gt;I am unable to see how he does not deserve it. A person who wrote off 47% of the country as 'leeches' and lied at every possible step deserves no sympathy. You reap what you sow.

&gt;However

Something something, in that Reddit *has* been known to defend Hitler in the past.)

&gt;It is pretty amazing that in such a short period of time you can go from missing becoming the leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world by a couple % to pumping your own gas like everyone else.

If you had a shred of common sense

I feel like if Obama was seen pumping his own gas, forced into the depravity of doing something for himself. But maybe I'm putting words in peoples' mouths now.

Anytime someone points out that OP made a breach of decency by taking this picture and putting it on a forum to mock him

&gt;I completely agree. I don't know if they just worked really hard to keep him looking polished while campaigning

Says the OP. Come on. In the first place, OP. Who the fuck are you call a man out on ""aging a few years"" just because he's not perfectly made-over for the cameras and lights? It's just pathetic to me that everyone is swarming over this picture, acting like Romney has fallen from some untouchable heights just because he appears in the wild.

And people *are* swarming. I searched ""Romney washed up"" or something, and bandwagoning galore. And that's just the beginning, I fear. I really hope this picture doesn't get any more traction than it already has. Hell, even by making this post I worry I'm feeding it.

It's the good old piracy jerk on /r/gaming

User GreyLlama was in the process of pirating an indie game when he saw a comment from the developer which said

So /r/gaming has a change of heart and actually feels bad about pirating this guy's game because he was so nice about it. And they think that any developer that supports pirating his own game ""truly deserves recognition"".

Here are some choice comments:

Now the newcomers to this game usually go straight for the lowest common denominator... the username.  There is free karma to gather merely by mentioning it

For the slightly more advanced redditor, and one 12 days ago indicating OPs family was shattered.  While this was ample evidence for some, it was simply not enough for most.

Now on to the analysis of the picture itself!  A lot of our internet gumshoes pointed out the fact the picture on the plate appears to be a touched up version of the image of the deceased woman circulating around the internet... with a different background.  Now this certainly seems plausible

What is missing here is that infamous reddit logic behind why it would have been photoshopped... why would any troll make the effort to take a picture

And therein lies the anser for far too many redditors.  THEY DID IT FOR THE KARMA!  Either it was a troll that wanted karma, or learn from, or benefit from, but this woman who might or might not be sharing some grief surrounding a very public ordeal is simply doing this for the karma.

&gt;Consequently, seemed to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation.

One more thing before I begin, so I know some of the context of the situation in Europe right now.  

So the situation is this.  A Mosque is 'occupied' by a group of French people as a protest towards multi-cultarilsim

With those quotes in mind, for a lack of a better term... Racist.  It is disgusting.  absolutely disgusting.  Complete failure to understand the situation on hand, complete failure to understand the implications of the words that they use, and complete disregard for so called ""liberalism"" of the Western World.  I would like to pull out a few quotes here:

&gt;Islam is not a race. Therefore, Sikhism, Buddhism, etc.) Violence should only be a last resort from stopping the spread of theocracy. It appears that some French people want to stop Islam before it spreads its influence and promotes Sharia Law. It should *continue to be done peacefully.
(http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/c6rhotp)

First lets take a look at the definition of racism:

&gt;Racism - a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races  determine cultural or individual achievement

and 
&gt;Race - any people united by common history, etc.: the Dutch race.

This quote, by defining islam as not a group of people with a common traditional and cultural background is, in my humble opinion a very implicit way of stating that it is ok to conduct an attack on a group of people just because they are not considered a 'race' by your definition.  

Yes there is a positive spin to it at the end
&gt; know Reddit is a liberal hivemind
No go areas in your own country

&gt;Edit: I spelled it berry instead of bury

&gt;Also before the mandatory ""They aren't all the same!"" the problem is is that despite not all of them being as extremist as the people who make the news
The sad thing is that Islam proberly could get along with Europe and be a part of society as a whole but people are so scared of being labelled a racist by some liberal who has just finished his liberal arts degree, with the key part of the article being about how we should feel sorry for the ""youths"" because of a poor upbringing.
Europe needs to show a backbone. We don't want to be culturally enriched . (accompanying photo http://i.imgur.com/inNYd.jpg) (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/c6rhre9)


Yes, but have simply created a façade of what they think Islam is from fairly negative sources, that write about the racial tensions between the westerners and the incoming immigrants.  I have many Muslim friends.  Muslims that live in Sweden.  Guess what? they are happy that they are in Sweden.  They respect the rule of law that they have to abide by, as well as the culture that they have to respect, and the kicker, they are all fairly serious in there commitment to their religion.  

&gt;At least they're only occupying the Mosque

&gt;Did you notice that when someone criticizes Christianity, Hinduism etc. generally nothing happens? But when someone says something against Muhammed or Islam people end up dead and embassies get stormed. I wonder why that is? Which of these religions seems the least progressive, the least tolerant, and the most dogmatic? (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/c6ri23z)

You do realize that there are *1.6 billion* Muslims in the world right now

&gt;Wow. Can someone please explain to me how it is ""racist"" to point out how the majority of crime is committed by Islamic immigrants? What exactly makes it racist to notice a pattern of behavior more specific to Islamic immigrants than other groups?

&gt;Also
There are even comments saying that anger towards nothing being done to remove/deport problem immigrants is a conspiracy by the far right for racial purity. No, and attack embassies when they get insulted. (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/c6rj9o4)

Right off the bat
Here is an article point out the majority of crimes committed in Sweden, that are going out and screwing the good Christian white man. Also again with stating that it is not racist to say or do negative things towards Muslims. Poppycock, people are dehumanizing them when they do this.

I could go on, but it is twofold, the failure of the government to control the rate of immigration, as well as their failure to help assimilate these people into  western society, and the immigrants who refuse to do anything about it.  It is not simply black and white here, there are a lot of things at fault here, and to simply state that a single party is at fault is simple and is devoid of proper discourse.  Now, but I do recognize that there is a problem that needs to be solved.  The discourse presented, and war crimes in general.  I am guessing that the majority of the commenter in these types of threads are Americans, suffice to say

&gt;I hate ""YOLO""- it's just an excuse to be a total asshole and completely disregard common sense and the people around you. Only obnoxious tools say YOLO.

Hates people who say YOLO because they are assholes and disregard common sense such as not judging and hating people for saying a word...???

Now comes for the part that really pisses me off. The condescending non drinkers and druggies. First off, I'd pick alcohol over weed any day.

&gt;You should try drugs. With proper research and understanding they are just as safe as alcohol. I've never got up the morning after a rave and been like ""Man I wish i hadn't danced all night and a great time.""
Edit: I'm just offering my opinion because that's how I am with drinking. If I have more than two beers I can't stop and always end up being blacked out and treating everybody i care bout like dogshit. Not a very good personality trait.

I don't like this comment, I just wanted to fucking die. Intense high though, there's nothing quite like a meth high. Probably didn't help that was also when I got mono at the same time. So I guess my anecdotal evidence is invalid. Thinking about it, don't know anyone who regrets going to a rave afterwards, but I also don't know anyone who regrets going to a party and getting drunk every time they drink. I do know people who have gotten way too fucking high and regret getting that high, a friend of mine did way too much MDMA once and started seizing. Just like people who have gotten too drunk. Alcohol is a fucking drug too, it's all about moderation.

This brave fellow
&gt;Marijuana

Now for those who have obviously never drank or gotten drunk.
&gt;Ok. What is it that people enjoy about getting shitfaced to the point where they are incoherent and vomiting all over themselves? I've never understood the attraction

If you've ever gotten shitfaced drunk and puked. You know that you didn't start the night looking to end up like a vomit covered idiot. People who say things like the above comment makes me think they have never drank or just trying to be a condescending prick.

In response to a comment telling someone to drink again
&gt;fuck that

Yeah

To wrap this all up, we make sure they are okay. We clean them up, put them on their sides with a trash bag near them. Then we stack shit on them and take pictures to show them the next day. None of us, would ever post their picture online without their permission because we aren't assholes who get off on shaming others. I'll admit that I have laughed at strangers who have gotten too messed up, but that is the furthest I've gotten.

There are clearly many people that support /r/atheism's new change

From the sidebar:

&gt;In an attempt to destroy all freedom of speech in the universe

The policy change to the subreddit brings hope, the sub has a long way to go before it becomes a high quality default with a well developed *atheism-pire* of related subreddits...

____

   &gt;There has been much stated on both sides of the Mod policy change, the reputation of this community.

This is a funny opening to me

   &gt;r/atheism has an online reputation that it has built up over the years, exciting, lively place where religion was mocked, debunked, and treated less as a sacred cow and more as a cow in the slaughterhouse. 

Well, disrespectful, and shallow content that doesn't seek to engage with the rest of the world. To be perfectly brave about it, the self enforcing hermeneutics in ""gOD is a lie, and if you don't like it, then you can fuck off"" is exactly the kind of thing that I would expect from a fundamentalist, or from someone who is very insecure about their position. 

Lampooning is fine

   &gt;Now, bland, lifeless place full of news you could easily have gotten off any of the hundreds of news sites out there.

No

What will happen is that the community will at least be average quality and young teens struggling with faith will not get the impression that fostering a persecution complex is the correct response in the face of actual persecution. 

I understand that reddit is a place for people to blow off steam about their real life problems, some high quality, and mostly average. As far as I can tell, that's what the policy is aiming for by disabling images. 

   &gt;Christians have been trying for a long time to get rid of this sub-reddit, through their constant whining and complaining about the sub-reddit, get it's hipness neutered. This way, in their view,  people checking out the place won't be swayed as easily to the dark side.

hahahahaha

This is probably my favorite paragraph. It begins with the assertion that *Christians on reddit* are persecuting *one of the largest* default subreddits because the subscribers *are atheists*. Also, rather than a life philosophy. The policy change was brought about by a Christian conspiracy. Also, hold onto the word ""neutered"" until the last paragraph. 

   &gt;The old r/atheism was a vibrant mix of serious and silly, it's just links to other news sites posts for the most part, and most first time visitors will never know about the other more vibrant atheism sub-reddits.

No, where it was completely buried. Links to other news sites? On a news aggregator? Fuck.  

   &gt;Yes, but now it's like going to high tea at grandma's.

k

   &gt;Will I unsubscribe? No. But, and keep pissing off Christians with it's presence. I just won't be checking it as frequently as I used to.

It was in this paragraph that the persecution complex ascends to brave-saiyan II

   &gt;But, and it is a disservice to the atheism community in general by reducing what was a vital, vibrant hub for atheism online to a limp and flaccid shadow of what it was.

Well, but a feudal system as you read the comments section. 

Remember ""neutered"" from above? If we consider that in combination with the last (obvious, we get the added bonus of a repressed male sexuality underscoring the misplaced sense of entitlement. Am I meant to believe that atheism is sexy and that making it less sexy is a bad thing? Am I meant to feel like *my* potency as a human being has been impugned? I don't know.

[The set-up](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h788c/serious_question/) - (If you visit the post

&gt; I'm an employer. I see a resume for a seemingly qualified person for a position I need to fill. I call the candidate in for an interview. During the interview it becomes clear that the candidate is a born again Christian (cross around the neck

&gt; Here's the question: If I decide not to hire this person because I see them as less intelligent/not capable of critical thought (as a direct result of their Christianess) is this religious discrimination? I would argue no; I'm not hiring them because I need an intelligent person to do the job and this was part of the screening process. However

&gt; Edit: In this hypothetical situation

&gt; Edit #2: Let's assume this is for a ""big-boy"" job. Not some entry level 19 year old at a grocery store or something.

Ladies and gentlemen

Top Comment:

&gt; well....I had a guy that I interviewed

&gt; Except when he started requesting all these days off cause of his religious doings and running around to preach.

&gt; I hired another guy.

Not really sure how his religion is relevant if the issue was him missing days but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

&gt; Hate to say it but you are right on the line. You better be able to make a case purely on qualifications between the 2 candidates.

""This is only a problem if you're worried about getting sued. Don't worry about the discrimination part

&gt; I'd personally call appeals to religion during an interview ""unprofessional."" Sure, but he doesn't need to bring it to work and put it on display any more than he needs to preface every sentence with, ""I'm a black man, but my perspective is..."" or, ""it may just be my feminine nature speaking, but...""

&gt; TL;DR: His religious preference is protected

Having a cross on your neck or mentioning your religion is the same as starting every sentence with ""as a black man"". Therefore

&gt; If he was talking about his imaginary friend Jake instead of God

Pure bravery

&gt; Don't do it. If he is this out and open during an interview

Christian = Religious fundamentalist

&gt; Who cares. Competition for jobs is fierce so there will always be someone better to choose.

If they're a Christian

&gt; It is discrimination, a slight indicator of mental deficiency that could negatively impact his job performance-is utterly irrelevant to the law. However, as has been mentioned by others, if you believe their self-expression (religious or otherwise) will be a hindrance to productivity (and let's face it, that's the REAL reason you don't want to hire him anyway), that is not discrimination.

&gt; Basically, because, strictly speaking, you're deciding based on his personality, not his religion.

It's discrimination even though you're right to think that he's mentally deficient. But

&gt; I own a small business in the Bible Belt and I face this situation all the time. First off, but sometimes it's worth it to get rid of some jackass who can't speak two sentences without praising god. In the end, it is your business, your decision, your call, and you don't owe anyone any explanation for your hiring practices, especially other employees or potential employees.

As a small business owner in the bible belt

&gt; If this person is otherwise qualified for the job

&gt; We have to keep in mind that not everyone who believes in these things (however silly they seem to a nonbeliever) is stupid. Many are simply indoctrinated or brainwashed

Of course it's religious discrimination! They're clearly brainwashed

&gt; as a person who has trained new employees for a few entry level jobs

&gt; In my experience the born again's are usually the least lasting employee's right under Mormons, fry cook's, cleaners, etc... if they can't be bothered to do half of those kind of jobs what make you think their qualified for a ""big boy"" job

We have a winner folks

&gt; I was thinking about a similar situation-- making a country that's officially non-religious

Wow

At this point it's worth noting that OP is now arguing with everyone that disagrees with his (clearly) already held belief and agreeing with anyone who supports him. This is either a wonderful meta-lesson in discrimination or wonderfully ironic. Here are some of his responses

Someone replies to OP by asking how they'd feel if they were discriminated against for being an atheist. OP responds:

&gt; I can almost guarantee you'd be denied jobs across the USA for being openly atheist. Doesn't make my stand any better

LovingAtheist explains the stupidity of that statement. OP responds:

&gt; But not by hatred. Again I'm talking about a born again Christian here. Someone who by my account is delusional. Literally not right in the head.

In a discussion over whether discriminating against **all** religion is the same as a specific religion

&gt; I see. So

Someone lets the OP know that they it's wrong and they should hire the best person for the job:

&gt; I would argue that this person is delusional and easily manipulated. Therefore probably not the best person for the job.

Crazy__eddie let's OP know that it makes *him* the silly one to discriminate:

&gt; Well

ioinic asks OP why he doesn't just test their critical thinking skills:

&gt; But born again Christians? If you're an able minded adult not capable of figuring out that the bible is full of hatred and unbelievable rubbish I really have a hard time trusting your judgement. Either that or you didn't actually read the bible and you dedicate your life to a falsity.

see0red explains that it's discrimination and if you substitute a political party

&gt; I'm talking about a born again Christian here. Not just your ordinary ""Oh

Kechlion tries to explain that judging a label is what makes it discrimination:

&gt; **I'm not suggesting I'm any better than any other person**. The difference between being a homosexual or a born again christian is choice. A born again christian (not a child

This blog post submitted to Blueglass

It starts off on a high note

&gt;So

I'll go over the high points of the list for hilarity now.

&gt;**1)Being on Reddit is like sitting in a group discussion of thousands of moderately intelligent people

Hahaha moderately intelligent people.  Right.  The ones who make poop jokes, only to follow it into the netherworld to beat it further. Where everyone is an expert, anecdotal evidence is enough to contradict reputable sources. And then has the gall to give this post as an example(includes the link, of course, which I'm not assed enough to do):

&gt; “What stupid question have you always been too embarrassed to ask

A thread asking for stupid questions

&gt;**3)Reddit allows for intense and evolving communities of special interests.** ....Many of the following are among the most active places online for their given topic:

Author then goes on to name the source of some of the hardest jerks in all of reddit, /r/fitness, /r/TwoXChromosomes, /r/malefashionadvice, /r/dubstep, /r/lgbt, /r/occupywallstreet

&gt;**4)Reddit is highly collaborative and easily spawns or expands collaborative efforts.**

But so help you god if you repost anything you mother fucker I'll get your ass. But he then goes on with this glorious example:

&gt;Another great example was when the Reddit community collaborated to influence an online poll being used by Greenpeace to name a whale that was part of its Great Whale Trail Expedition

&gt;**5) Reddit Helps Determine The News Cycle.**

If by 'determines'

&gt;**6)Reddit is the ultimate investigator.**

Reddit is the ultimate ~~investigator~~ Witch hunt. FTFY. Where facts are only necessary if someone want's to prove something *to you*.

&gt;**7) Reddit is a meme maker and trend setter.**

I don't know about you guys

&gt; **8)Reddit is a life saver (literally).**  One of the most impressive sub-Reddits is the community at r/suicidewatch. These selfless people are there to talk to those who feel they have nothing left to live for. The community is certainly responsible for saving lives
With nearly 9

I'm starting to understand *why*....

&gt;**10) Reddit includes experts from nearly all fields, and specialties. Many of whom share their inside knowledge freely.**

Oh yeah.  I'm sure everyone here really has the qualifications they claim to.  

And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you...

He then goes on to name a list of celebrites who've done little more than host an AMA as 'notable redditors' and 'experts in their field', Stephen Colbert, Zack Braff, and Ken Jennings, plus a few more.  The only person there I would call an expert is NDT, and maybe Ken Jennings. But they're hardly prolific redditors, at least not on their primary accounts. 

Here's my favorite one:

&gt;**11) Reddit allows for in-depth discussion over topics that otherwise would never ever be talked about in a group way.** In many ways Reddit can be like hanging out with a bunch of friends. While this often leads to long threads on the pointless and inane

And then the mother fucker links to this comment

*sigh*

And this post

A thread about how to wipe your ass!!!!! Because that's *exactly* the kind of dire conversations missing from this world

And then

&gt;**14) Reddit is like always having the wittiest

I just....

Then cites /u/prufrock451's story about the marines sent back to fight ancient Romans

But that's not really funny or witty

&gt;**15. Reddit can celebrate individual victory or achievement in a BIG way.**

Yeah with upvotes, and new inside group jokes.

&gt;**16. Reddit can be a source of power and revolution for the people.** If one idea resonates with a community

Oh my shitting god. Yes, not cyber terrorist and petty hackers, and *definitely* not just pissed of wieners with chips on their shoulders and a complete disregard for the law or the harm that befalls innocent people inappropriately targeted.  Remember, reddit *always* requires facts, and is quite thorough in checking them before taking any action.

Oh
&gt;""The community was among the first to protest SOPA and Reddit was a key player in the SOPA blackout."" 

We did it

&gt;**17. Reddit encourages interaction in a completely unique way**  . Although “karma” is worthless in a monetary sense

No! No you son of a bitch, it's not a*good* thing!

&gt;Conclusion
While the future of Reddit remains unknown, we will likely see many permutations of the system pioneered by Reddit, likely with [great benefit](http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/reddit-story-ideas_b8643) to us all.

I....You...you monster. You're trying to subvert the whole site, show some mercy.  Don't do this to us. You need someone whacked? We'll help, heck you can come to reddit for help with that and many of us will gladly oblige.  But please, please stop encouraging *that*.

As is my nature, heterosexual male. I agreed with the ethics behind the dumpster diving, but the practice of it made my stomach turn, and I rarely indulged in food obtained that way. But I was bursting with enthusiasm for their spirit, and I was desperate to let them know that I was one with them. 

Over time

It's a process I go through, different thing that kicks you out of the malaise of day to day life. You think of it as a challenge to wedge yourself into their lifestyle. Your success is a measure of your open mindedness, your ability to function in a group. A new merit-badge for your concept of self. But part of that success is disillusionment. To become part of the group, the group is necessarily demystified. You see the ideals for what they are: affectations, desperate attempts to forge a unique identity. These people are just as lost as you. It's bittersweet, but this is the empathetic process of becoming truly accepted.

But sometimes something very unfair happens. The community to which you are struggling to assimilate degrades, but I new that this was something special, a large group of people with a certain flavor. A certain sense of humor that was typically Internet, but attempted (sometimes failingly) to be high-brow enough to keep the SHOCK AND GORE dehumanizing variety out. Reddit's foil was 4chan, and there was always a debate regarding the extent to which Reddit was lying to itself. Reddit could, indeed, be worse at times. But that's the Internet.

The disillusionment process went as expected. I started noticing the casual racism here and there. The way grammar nazis can fail to understand the evolving nature of language and the legitimacy of regional dialects. The dominating demographic was educated young white males

But I can officially say as of right now

The first time I saw it was [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/y1pvn/it_moved_rocks_like_this_for_a_while/). Somebody found a dead squirrel, and people upvoted him.

The second time I saw it was in a thread so disgusting

Remember the stick in the first squirrel's hand. [That stick has already degraded into a beer can](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yq1ul/last_night_was_nuts/) in my latest find. At least the first guy was trying to appeal to the pro-science community with his (albeit absurd) claim that the squirrel had used it as a tool.

And what's possibly worse is that the hivemind has already developed an established circle-jerky reaction to these posts. People enjoy pointing out that the original poster simply fashioned a dead squirrel to his liking

i understand my predisposition to disillusionment

The only conclusion I can come to is that as something catches on

Think of this as an introductory post for me. I'm new to circle broke, so I'm sorry if I did any of that in this post. Anyway, this is why I'm here. Hope you enjoyed the read. And seriously, what's with the dead squirrels? ",Quality Post,False,,False,t3_yrqpn

A much more level-headed look at the law can be found [here](http://clcablog.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/is-this-more-than-in-god-we-trust/). 

Now a disclaimer: this law is patently absurd in ever way, from both a legal and moral standpoint. It will be tossed out and used as toilet tissue if it reaches the Supreme Court. And even, in some bizarro universe where this law could somehow be passed, there is not a judge in this country that would convict anyone under it. As I said earlier, I'm not even sure how you could go about violating it.

1346878712.0,zeut7,r/SRSDiscussion: A jerk both so similar and so different from the hivemind,Squidmasher,348,116,489,"Today

Obviously, the weird fixation on false accusations of rape, and the racist fury that appears on r/Videos every time something about black people committing a crime, it’s pretty hard to dispute that stuff like that occurs, and that it detracts a lot from legitimate discussions that could potentially exist if redditors weren’t constantly making the same racist and misogynistic comments.

Another thing to note is that Circlebroke has generally always been fairly sympathetic to the views of SRS. Again, partially because of the racism/misogyny, and partially because both r/shitredditsays and r/circlebroke are meta subreddits which attract people of similar interests. But regardless, there’s been a lot of pro-SRS circlejerking going on in this sub and I’d like to throw in something on the other side for a change.

Furthermore, which means criticizing it for being too jerky would be like criticizing r/circlejerk for doing the same. Thus, I’ll avoid discussion of r/shitredditsays in this post.

What I will complain about is r/SRSDiscussion. Although their views are far from those of mainstream Reddit, and the hivemind can hardly be called anti-masturbation. NoFap is fair game for complaining here, though, because it is quite the circlejerk (well, in a sense of the word; they don’t approve of literal jerking). In the same way, many of the other SRS subreddits, while very opposed to the hivemind as a whole

Well

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ll start our journey into r/SRSDiscussion, we should also note that “comments which are discordant with the ethos of social progressivism will be removed,” and that the first rule is that you must agree with all of their basic premises to post. Essentially, disagreement with SRS, even if is respectful and polite, is not allowed on SRSDiscussion, which is a recipe for a massive circlejerk. r/Christianity, allows atheists to post and even question the central premise of Christianity, I fail to see why SRSDiscussion can’t do the same. There’s a fine line between a safe space and an echo chamber

But enough about rules; let’s take a look at some actual posts in SRSDiscussion and the furious circlejerking involved.

Next top level comment seems more sincere. If the karma counts are to be trusted, to get those sweet 900+ karma, there is a big old helping of that self-loathing we all came here to bask in:

&gt;Throwaway because gross.

&gt;My bf and I are both obese, penetrating me while spooning pretty much can't happen because my butt is to big. Also problems with me being on top: for one, I can't hold the squat position for terribly long before my thighs start to burn. Also stomach tends to flop when bouncing up and down, which is embarrassing for me. Also when he's on top, I need him to hold himself up a bit so that the weight of him+ his stomach (where he carries his weight) makes it hard to breathe, especially if he tries to kiss me at the same time. If we were both fit, I could be on top for longer, he could pick me up

The next top level comment is an apparently sincere answer a much proportionately lower dose of self-loathing

The first thing you notice when you go to /r/worldpolitics is the bright green footer warning you that **""You're not subscribed to this awesome subreddit""**. The first time I saw it I checked to see if my computer had a virus

Ah yes

But before we move on, /r/beatingwomen is more offensive!"". These points are all true and valid, but I would like to point out one key detail. /r/Communism has 3k subs. /r/beatingwomen has 1.7k subs. /r/Anarchism has 28k subs. /r/worldpolitics? **60k subs.** That's a small city! My point is, what /r/worldpolitics lacks in jaw-dropping ridiculousness, it makes for with the fact that it has one of the best subscribers-to-shittyness ratios of all subs.

On to the threads! As you look through the frontpage, no matter how un-sourced and sensationalized, that feeds the flames against Israel is unanimously upvoted to the top (We'll get into more detail about their ridiculous antisemitism in the comments section). But of course, the threads that aren't about Israel are just as ridiculous. Currently sitting at number 3:
&gt;Some North Korean Refugees Are So Depressed By Their Life In The South That They Go Back North

You hear that? Enlightened North Koreans are so depressed by the horrors of capitalism that they wish that they could return to the prosperity and glory of communist North Korea! North Korea is best Korea!

Because threads have to be linked to actual articles

Let's take a look at the top thread:

&gt;Zionist JEWS are accusing their opponents of anti-Semitism aka anti-Jewishness. This makes it about racist

&gt;Until more of organized Jewry stands up and declares institutional JEWISH supremacism wrong, and the kind of Jewish supremacism [1] practiced by the Democratic Party and [2] on the neocon right, organized Jewry is fair game for any and all criticism.
&gt;They can't get away any longer with hiding their racist, behind accusations of anti-Semitism.

&gt;This drives them crazy. They thought they could ride accusations of anti-Semitism to trans-national Zionist hegemony forever.

&gt;They were wrong.

&gt;""All Jews""? I wouldn't say that. But certainly most Jews are Zionists

&gt;Certainly, but by and large, the vast majority of organized Jewry is racist/Zionist (despite the whole Jewish victim shtick thing, and empty claims of ""social justice"" and ""humanitarianism,"" which is all self-serving, opportunistic cover.)

&gt;They seem to get it from their racist Jewish doctrine and dogma.

Nothing has ever sickened me more on Reddit than some of these comments that I read. The part that disgusted me so much was how genuine the comments were

The neckbeards were sleeping while their plumage they’d stroke.    
The complaints had been posted to the front page with care
In hopes that some upvotes soon would be there.

The mods were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of literally Hitler danced in their heads.    
And I who had relentlessly toiled all year long    
Had just settled in for a nap

When out on /r/all there arose such a jerk
The likes of which would drive any sane person berserk.    
Away to my laptop I flew like a flash
To see what every redditor was attempting to trash.    

But to my dismay there was nothing new here
Just the low hanging fruit we see year after year.    
DAE hate this? DAE hate that?    
Contrarian viewpoints are where it’s at.    

Christians are dumb
They don’t use logic and reason like me or you.    
Don’t forget Muslims

For we love our dear leader Barack Obama.    
What’s that I hear? Mitt Romney you say?    
Well

You say you’re offended? Well
We don’t have time for your feelings you maggot.    
Men’s Rights is here and SRS is not far behind.    
Amidst all this madness I feel I’m losing my mind.    

Poor OP in the friendzone. That girl must be a bitch.    
Insulting people on the internet seems to be reddit’s niche.    
She’s fat
Why won’t girls have sex with me anymore?    

And here come the memes. Dear Science
This looks like a job for NDT, and Paul!

The bravery levels have just reached a maximum of “so!”    

As I sat there in dismay at the crap these people embrace
A sudden and unexpected smile came across my face.

1369098574.0,1eqfg6,A Review of Confession Bear on Advice Animals,desantoos,276,49,137,"At the top of Advice Animals today

&gt;What if I told you that your confession bear memes suck. All of them.

Confession Bear has become so bad, but I think it is high time someone showed the entirety of Confession Bear, all the terrible posts at once, to show just how godawful that macro has become. As we near 1 year of this macro's dominance in Advice Animals, I present a review:

Like much of the shitty things on Reddit, the OP was sort of funny here, so it fit in with the concept of AdviceAnimals being a sort of (or supposedly) funny subreddit.

However

1. People who are trying hard to get Karma by ""confessing"" to something everybody already likes. This subset has become known as **Popular Opinion Bear** or **Bravery Bear**.
2. People who are complaining about something semi-secretive and think AdviceAnimals is a good place for therapy/relationship advice.
3. People who think Advice Animals is a great place to talk about illegal things you've done.
4. Racists/homophobes/transphobes/sexists who have finally found a way to blare their message across Reddit. Mostly just people trying to be edgy so again it fits the BraveryBear tag.

**Type 1:**
How this category works is that you say something the hivemind already loves. [Example:](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1ep9xy/my_mother_had_a_full_time_job_and_raised_me_on/)
&gt;I hate that stay at home moms claim raising a child is the hardest job/I think it's just an excuse for them not to find a real job

A perfect circlejerk macro that plays right into Reddit's bratty and childfree hivemind. Note that there is no joke here: just a space for someone to preach to the choir. You can scroll through /r/braverybear and find a whole bunch that were pulled out (the best one there is [heavily ironic](http://resme.me/3t0su1.jpg)) that fit this theme. Outside of that sub

&gt;[I like seeing movies normally/than in 3D](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/11554f/i_really_dont_think_its_that_great/)



&gt;[My first thought when I heard Lil Wayne was in critical condition was/

[See also this wonderful synopsis with links to many more of Type 1 confessions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10mk2s/confession_bear_or_reddit_i_confess_to_having_the/) One point of emphasis: never is there an attempt at humor on one of these things. Instead

**Type 2:** I don't know why people think Confession Bear on Advice Animals is the place to air out their troubled past

[Here's one floating to the top right now:](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eocvv/i_hate_him_and_i_always_will_but_i_cant_bring/)

&gt;Everybody at my school thinks I hate the star quarterback because I am ""jealous"" / I really hate him because one day after working out he sexually assaulted me in the shower.

First off, which is a good idea but still just about every day there's a post at the top that just shouldn't be in AdviceAnimals. Because the comments are, except for a few at the top really really terrible. I mean look at the responses to this post:

&gt;[Was it butt stuff or wiener stuff?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eocvv/i_hate_him_and_i_always_will_but_i_cant_bring/ca2cjbs)

&gt;[what you need to do is

[Here's another, have much more stringent moderation.

[Here's a good post on those that fit this category.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15gp2m/you_all_saw_this_one_coming_most_recent_meme_on/)

**Type 3**: So far this type has happened maybe a dozen of times from what I've collected. The famous one was [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1btuzb/finally_have_the_guts_to_say_it/). Crime Confession Bear is awful. I don't know what else to say about this one.

**Type 4** Herein lies the latest evolution of Confession Bear: **Xenophobic Bear**. You see, etc. say ""it's all just a joke"" post it like it was a DAE to see other people agree with you, and walk away justified of your prejudices. Here is where the circlejerk stands today.

[Here's an example:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eonnm/sorry_not_sorry_hopefully_doesnt_make_the_front/)

Confession Bear started out as a way to be funny by confessing something true-yet-funny. It has morphed four times

I conclude by going back to the banner. Obviously the mods hate Confession Bear. Maybe

TL;DR Confession bear is unfunny and not in the spirit of the rest of Advice Animals.

It feels good to finally get that off my chest. It was in those comment sections in my early reddit days that I learned the downvote button is only used for when you disagree with someone. I still browse through the articles though since they are usually relevant to the times.

If you have been paying attention to US news this week, and [emails about talking points on Benghazi which implied the administration had knowledge aforethought](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/17/get-caught-up-on-benghazi-in-five-short-paragraphs/).

The first two issues are some serious,"" but there are rumblings of impeaching Obama about it so it is worth acknowledging. None of these issues cast Obama in a good light, so in the vein of getting to act smug I decided to sort through the top posts in /r/politics to see how far down I had to go for these stories to show up. Clearly the civil-liberties jerk would have rocketed this shit straight to the top posts for the past week. However, reddit did not disappoint my thirst for complaining material.

Of the top 6 posts, one is about [police brutality](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/349894), and the top post is Sen. Franken wanting to [regulate credit rating agencies](http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/05/14/sen-al-frankens-plan-to-prevent-the-next-financial-meltdown-a-clean-up-of-the-credit-rating-system/). 

All good issues I suppose

&gt;He may be a grouchy old shithead

Thanks for the hard-hitting commentary

Next stop for the #realtalk is at post #16. It's an article on the IRS scandal, and that there are these evil things called [student loans](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C959DC0B-7D8C-4AAE-8FBF-DF74791B8A26) which cost money.

Onward we go to the next post about the IRS scandal at #24

You don't get to the phone records scandal until #26

What is particularly aggravating to me about posts #7, and not about the actual issue. 7 is a statement of support for Obama, not about the scandal. 16 is related to the issue but ultimately about campaign finance. 24 is about the tax status of churches, the real issue only gets a brief mention in the intro. If you keep scrolling you get to more awesome gems like [Michele Bachmann is acting crazy](http://www.thedailydolt.com/2013/05/12/michele-bachmann-claims-911-benghazi-were-judgment-from-god/) about Benghazi at #41 and more [""the REAL IRS scandal""](http://thecontributor.com/real-irs-scandal-agency-audits-found-wealthy-taxpayers-failed-pay-48-billion-taxes) at #43.

If you didn't know, you are simply to dense to understand what the word philosopher even means, which is why our gracious overlords had to translate that into Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.

&gt;American here. I made sure I got the right version of the movie

Im sure your movie experience was completely different with the superior European version. 

&gt;it's PHILOSOPHER. not SORCERER.
bloody hell. i know they enjoy changing words around for different audiences but what's wrong with philosopher? is it too long or something?
i mean, he's a philosopher where i'm from. Is he a fucking sorcerer now? because he wasn't a bloody wizard.
I'm overreacting but i don't give a poo. PHILOSOPHY FTW

When I got to this thread this was in the negatives

The best response is this.

&gt;Teen Mutant Hero Turtles.
Because British people don't understand what a ""ninja"" is.

Could it be? Could the most superior of peoples not understand something!?

&gt;Nope

Damn

&gt;why is it called the sorcerer's stone in americs?

This brilliant poster is asking a very insightful and often overlooked change to the title. 

He gets an answer that is the highlight of the thread

&gt;Because Scholastic the US publishers thought American kids wouldn't understand the word ""philosopher"". They bugger up British books all time, has Bilbo (renamed as Brandon) drive to the Misty Mountain in his Camero, and talk to Smaug (Dwayne T Dragon) resulting in a long lasting friendship and some hugging.

I don't remember that part of The Hobbit. 

To further this point

&gt;that's because our schools suck so bad kids can't read

And yet

The next post

&gt;I think that American Publishers had elected to use ""Sorcerer's"" Stone because of marketing. It ""sounds better"" to say (Americans love alliteration) and it more readily gets the magic theme across as a philosopher does not do magic.

Hmm

&gt;But the Philosopher's Stone is a thing (it's one of the goals of alchemy)

As if the Philosophers Stone is any more real than the Sorcerers Stone. 

&gt;My book says Philosophers. This is rubbish.

Very simple. Very British. I love it.

Oh man
&gt;Hi reddit
&gt;This post and some of the replies actually made me want to login.
&gt;Anyway people making broad generalizations about various things makes me mad.
I've lived most of my life in Australia where there are many programs for people who genuinely need help. I've seen people beg for money
However there was a few people in the CBD who really did need help. I always gave those guys a few dollars as I passed, I guess a journalist had noticed him too. Poor guy was fighting (or tried too) the government about something in court and got taken to the cleaners.
&gt;Anyway now that I am living in SF
I lament the fact that America is so arse backwards in so many damn socially acceptable things elsewhere in the world. Healthcare being god damn number 1. Healthy people pay taxes and work until retirement. Others being public transport (SF is pretty good though), I thought your freeways were meant to awesome... they are full of fucking holes. I could go on somewhat about this topic. But I wont.
&gt;I don't think the OP gives atheists specifically a good name. Everyone is capable of what the OP did. They just choose not too
Also labeling those people who shunned the OP is fucking stupid. They're just ignorant and stereotyping people. Much like the majority of you are here.
You know what would help fix this; If instead of walking away or applying said labels to people

. . .but this one is even better!

&gt;I've done this countless times, it was freezing out (yes, it does get cold in Florida). I was with a few friends on our way to a concert (Mindless Self Indulgence) at The Social. I went over and asked if he was okay, if there was anything I could do for him. He gave me a pretty standard sounding sob story, which always gets me, but the thing that really hit me was when he said he was really just saving up for a pair of work boots and a tool belt so he could start working independent construction again, as he knows a person who runs a local business.
&gt;So, got him some food and asked him to wait there. I came back with boots in his size and a tool belt. I gave him an extra $50 and said that should get him at least a tool or two to start. He told me he couldn't accept any of this, so I tell him I still lived at home, had two jobs and my writing, I was doing alright, so I could handle doing this. The guy started crying in the Subway and gave me probably the most passionate hug I've ever been given where both parties were still wearing clothes. I embrace it, but honestly never felt like I'll hear from this guy ever again.
&gt;I gave him my card (I was a self righteous writer so I used to carry business cards, because this was maybe six years ago when I was 20 or 21). Maybe three months later I get a call from the guy asking me if I wanted to meet him for lunch at the Subway. I figured why the hell not, it's only a fifty or so minute drive and he gave me a few days notice.
&gt;I head out to find he's working and staying with two of the guys from the local contractor company he was employed with. That he was doing better than he had in a long time. The fact that he wasn't just fucking with me and instead actually put that money to use was amazing. He even brought the tool belt and most of his equipment with him to show me. The guy was somewhere between 50-55
I've done smaller things for people in similar situations since then, but this is still my go to story whenever a similar topic arises (or if I want to impress a woman I'm courting).

Another self-congratulatory jerk

&gt;I hate that towns like this exist. You are 100% right, but I still donate (actually my shitty minimum wage job does awesome work for them) to the local food bank. Over 3000 families use it.
&gt;Non-locally, or are just gonna buy booze - I don't give a shit and I can't tell the difference. If my $2 buys them a burger or a beer, I don't care. He'll sleep better either way. Specifically, one of the reasons my boyfriend and I don't plan on having children is so that we have more available money to donate. This is why.Man should take care of man, plain and simple. The people who gave you dirty looks are too fucking stupid and selfish to realize this, and if there is a god, I'm sure he's very disappointed in his children who behave that way.
&gt;Edit: To expand on my shitty minimum wage job, Kohl's corporate will donate $500 per month to that organization. We regularly have 3 or 4 groups that we work with per month, and have a year long contract with the aforementioned food bank. Specifically what this means, is they are absolutely getting $500/month because if they can't get enough employees to do their 3 hours (which I've never seen happen) then the managers do it. The food bank told us that $500/month will stock their shelves. This is why I can go to work and sell shoes every day.

and the icing on the cake:

&gt;I think it would be a shame for people as altruistic as you to not have kids.

The bravery here is off the charts! Or something

&gt;I was in a similar situation about 6 yrs ago.I was nine months pregnant,I'm very hungry."" She said she was sorry but she couldn't and told him to come back in an hr when her manager would be there. I look around at all the people in the room,all who will be going back to their homes..and kitchens full of food.No one is offering help and some even snicker in disgust.The man says ""Ok,god bless"" and walks out.I was next in line,I quickly order him a sandwich and run,pregnant and all,out to the parking lot to find him.He was gone.I looked all over.I spent at least 30 mins driving around the area looking.I was so upset with myself for not screaming at him to wait before he walked out.I couldn't find him so instead I walked back into Quizno's and gave the sandwich back to the girl and told her if he came back to give it to him.Everyone when realizing the sandwich I had ordered had been for the homeless man,and I was also the only one who tried to help.
&gt;TL;DR:Ran after a homeless man 


I'm sorry, it does:

&gt;Move the fuck out of America dude or at the very least, I live in the UK and Reddit is virtually the only place I hear of US politics/issues/debates (and we are two of the closest allies apparently). Even the most staunch right wing conservatives here from the old private schools think the people you've described are bat-shit crazy and are fine with abortion and contraception and the rules around rape etc. etc. etc.

It is possible because of reddit's [incredible positive attitude](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/z39bi/what_a_wonderful_place/c6146n1)

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/c7oqqp4

&gt;I found /r/ska surprisingly snobby. They get very agressive when something that isn't typical ska is posted. Punk band playing ska? ""Fuck you

&gt;A mention of Streetlight Manifesto causes a civil war to erupt in the subreddit.

The highest response is someone expressing disbelief that other people have different niche interests than he does:

&gt;People are snobs about fucking ska?

&gt;""This is not real ska because there isn't a guy with a fedora and checkered suspenders playing a horn in a part of the song that goes 'brrt drrrt drt drt drrrt brrrt'""

Because people being very particular and enthusiastic about their favorite music genre is just so weird

This mention caused a flood of /r/askredditors to show up in /r/ska. One very creative redditor showed how they can come up with really creative jokes and gags by mentioning their love for a disliked band mentioned in the askreddit thread parent. See here:

http://np.reddit.com/r/Ska/comments/15q5n4/does_anyone_else_just_love_streetlight_manifesto/

Luckily the moderators were quick to nuke the thread. The comments are basically filled with poor attempts to provoke the alleged snobbery of /r/ska:

&gt;One time I heard them and they were so ska that I ska'd all over my ska.

&gt;Ska.

Next up is /r/vegan. See here:

&gt;/r/vegan and I am a vegan. I just wanted recipes. Not a million pics of dead animals.

&gt;The last straw for me was a post about how Ellen was evil for eating eggs from chickens her friend kept.

This one is not surprising, I haven't met any people who attempted to shame me for eating meat, in fact I've heard far more about these vegan assholes from people bitching about vegans. 

A quick venture into /r/vegan shows the top post is a ham-fisted (sorry) trolling attempt. 

http://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/15qcze/dear_god_you_guys_are_snobs/

&gt;Please be aware, when people ask honest questions, you lash out at them, down voting them into a second hell, and calling them ""pigs"" ""murderers"" and strangely ""fascists"". This subreddit is for people interested in the vegan way of life/culture. And you are scaring them away, and creating a bad rep for yourselves.

Yes

Another clumsy trolling attempt: 

http://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/15qcxo/my_friend_just_came_out_as_a_vegan_how_do_i_cope/

Third up is /r/coffee. This one had a pretty significant invasion but the moderators reacted while I was writing this post

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/c7opnqc

&gt;For me it was r/coffee

Interesting. /r/coffee was mentioned by the OP of the whole askreddit thread. Presumably the response in /r/coffee to his question about kuerig cups is what inspired the post. I actually looked at the OP's posting history and did not see any submissions in /r/coffee. This is when I discovered that

&gt;My old post was removed because I violated the rules

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/c7opowb

So there is an incredibly high chance this entire witchhunt thread was started because he was held accountable to the subreddit's rules and that made him mad. 

I did a search for keurig and came upon this thread:

I was on my way to my field placement (I went to a preschool once a week to help out) and there were two kids with their mom in the front of the bus, saw me, smiled, and went back to reading his newspaper. The other two kids in the front seemed to be emboldened by this move, and also said hi. I waved to them, but instead of getting the small ignore from the parent, the mother scowled at me and steered her children's faces away from my general direction.

So here's an article that's bubbled to the top of my least favourite default sub jauntily titled

Let that soak in for a moment while I take you through the first of two massive issues I have with r/wroldnews; their complete and total inability to critically asses information.

[The article in question] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/9719247/Amsterdam-to-create-scum-villages.html) - considered worthy of 1400 upvotes by /r/worldnews readers - is so poorly written and cobbled together that it is virtually indecipherable. How bad is it? As a reconstructed hack

**Who** is being moved to these new Scum Villages? Oh, ""the worst offenders"",  ""trash"" and ""scum"". I'm not kidding, that's as specific as it gets about the behavior of those needing to be removed. What qualifies as 'anti-social'? Who decides? There is not even a single interview with anyone directly affected by this or any sense of what the people of Amsterdam think about it. But who needs that kind of nuance when we're talking about ""scum"". Which leads me to... 

**What** is this legislation exactly? If you can find any specific policy in there

**Where** are the ""scum"" being moved to? I mean there is a description of the type of housing on offer (caravans and containers) but where is it? What do those living around these new 'scum villages' have to say? 

**When?**  The tenses are so mixed up in this piece of shit that I can't even tell if this is proposed legislation or if its already in effect. 

**Why?** Always the most import question - and I love the Telegraph for just lettin' it hang like a stale fart. But not to worry

So let's take a little peek inside to see what sort of thoughtful and reflective discussion is at hand. Surely the superior intellects

- The pope and his backward ideas on gays

- The huge scandals involving the catholic church in child abuse made a lot of people go WTF and just resign completely

- The rise of individualism means there's less place for god, this mythical god plays no role in it.

Followed by the even more relevant

&gt; There really comes a point where you have to say
I fractured my wrist on the monkey bars when I was in Grade 2. Im not saying it made me tougher but I certainly think ahead when doing activities. As opposed to jumping in assuming everything is safe.

This comment is interesting

&gt; I like *my* playgrounds with danger - it helps to train *kids* to be careful and to understand what pain and consequence are.

Of course it's the fault of the parents: 

&gt; Kids aren't the pussies now and days it is the parents. They are so fucking scared of everything they transfer that into their kids who end up being pussy adults. +32

Here we have an interesting - if true - contribution: 

&gt; I grew up in the countryside with huge trees/rocks, bikes, boats, ziplines, mopeds before i could reach the ground. Pretty much all the things that can easily kill a dumb kid. Acording to todays standards i shouldnt be alive. Just lucky i guess.

It doesn't occur to this poster that maybe part of growing up in the countryside means being taught about things like safety around farm machinery and being more familiar with natural hazards. The park in question was a city park; perhaps those kids and parents have other concerns. 

Meanwhile: 

&gt; Creating wimpy people is pretty clearly the goal of the corporate-media, they are now little more than factories churning out docile and inept drones.

And: 

&gt; When I was 12, not because something failed. My parents and I wrote a letter to the school explaining that the only person that did anything wrong was myself, and I would not want them to waste their time or money or ruin the other kids play time over it. Nowadays at that same school, kids can't even run outside lest they trip and get a booboo and wind up owning the school. It's considered roughhousing and too violent for them. They can't even play dodgeball, kickball, or baseball at recess, only in Gym

For a website that loves to spot fallacies and bias

Around early morning of 1/13/13, and it linked directly to CB. 


/r/circlebroke moderator klaatu_barada_nikto noticed this and quickly made CB and /r/circlebroke2 private. He then talked to AA's mods to take it off


Now let me set the scene at that time. Without a place to complain, atheist, STEM-loving children and their Swedish spouse. The discussion in /r/subredditdrama was very sad, as many painted these poor, poor people as foreign invaders, bullies, and Christian conservatives, we are just SRS-lite. These people were probably blinded by light shining through their glass houses


Now in the period of martial law, and some of the best quality posts ever seen graced our front page, such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16hoyv/i_heard_u_made_reddit_mad/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16hazu/we_are_temporarily_private_because_fuck/) and especially [that](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16haqg/dae_circlebroke/). CB intended to win at this game, and was determined to not give into the siege. They would endure these countless hours on small rations of Sagan, and only limited access to fresh Social Justice. 

Back on the outside, who tells the fateful mortal to turn their Sub private. The mods agree, and CJ is made [private](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/16h8dw/rcirclejerk_is_set_to_private_as_well/), but with a twist. The mods relay a message to their followers:
&gt;a message from the moderators of /r/circlejerk
&gt;
&gt;Sorry
&gt;
&gt;We will reopen

Accepting the challenge, and that the doors to their heaven shall reopen later that day. 


That was not all that happened however. After around 10 hours of linking to CB, by changing their background to goatse. A brave soul from AA makes a scene there also, which you can find [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/comments/16h9k1/the_average_user_here_is_way_younger_than_in/c7w1iwb?context=1) .

1370800148.0,1fzow0,Why Reddit's STEM jerk is laughably inaccurate (and why STEM students aren't scientists).,snallygaster,312,98,261,"As all of you probably know, in which humanities students are considered to be useless navel-gazers in comparison to the clearly *superior* people studying math and physics. Here's [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/medqw/grade_inflation_might_be_the_reason_kids_choose/) thread just to meet the guidelines

Outside of some lucrative STEM majors, very inaccurate. 

In all honesty, and highlight why the STEM jerk is so laughably unfounded.

A scientist is somebody who contributes to the pool of scientific knowledge by conducting research and publishing papers. STEM grads do not (usually) do this, by Reddit's standards. 

Let's take a look at [unemployment rate by major](http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3) (**edit**: very bad stats

The sad fact of the matter is that you can't really do shit in your field with a BSc in most STEM disciplines. There is essentially no use for somebody with a bachelor's degree level of knowledge in science. If you have a BSc in Chemistry, those with a bachelor's in Chemistry are actually quite useful in industry, but it's doubtful that Quality Control is one of the jobs lauded as superior by those wanking over STEM fields. The fact of the matter is that [over half of recent STEM graduates can't find jobs in their fields](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-05-24/news/bs-ed-stem-20130524_1_stem-jobs-math-workers).  Yes, my cheeto-encrusted pals, that means that most STEM graduates get to look forward to hunching over in cubicles next to those *inferior* philosophy grads they seem to loathe. 

Because most Redditors are spry, in entering a STEM degree, they'll be contributing great things to society. Unfortunately, the reality is that, for the most part, a bachelor's degree isn't meant to prepare one to enter a scientific field. A bachelor's degree is meant to give somebody the *tools* to move forward to higher education, or to prepare them to enter the workforce. The only advantage that comes from most STEM degrees is the impression that a STEM degree is more difficult than a humanities degree. This may give STEM graduates a slight advantage over humanities graduates, especially by Reddit's standards

And you know what? That's totally okay. As it stands

If most STEM majors end up working the same jobs as humanities majors

[In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/), because I know what's coming.  

The debate about socialism comes after the OP appeals to authority about [how many famous people are socialists](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x22mb).  Wow

[Norway](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x30j7).  That's right, commits a fallacy of false continuum, and ignores socialism's *actual* 100 year track record.  Upvoted.

OP's response: [Well, vague man...](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x2r7y).  (Didn't know a high standard of living was so difficult to define.)

And, early socialism didn't work because it turned into too much state power (but next time will be different!), you fundies don't know what socialism even means, it *has* worked ""all the time, everywhere"":

&gt;And that actually is something that works well all the time, there have even been stateless socialist ""states"" about which history has been written (basically short-lived communes that were drowned in their own blood like Paris in 1882, parts of Germany and Italy after WWI, etc), the most well-known probably being the anarchist controlled parts of Spain during the Spanish Civil War, which were eventually destroyed by fascist and Soviet-supported armies. But you can read all about it in George Orwell's *Homage to Catalonia!*

(check it out in a socialist's book, you just don't understand, pretending socialism had something to do with a 40-hour workweek and other benefits (lol), and last but not least, *an italicized warning that ""there isn't going to be a future for humans on the Earth""* unless we turn to glorious socialism and will economic dreams into reality! (That's how it works, right?)  Then, as a sign off

It's pathetic.  Redditors pick theories and portions of history that suit their ideology, but fuck economic science!

A. Her daughter is 12 years old

B. She was caught sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night with a boy

So

Oh.

Yep
&gt;
&gt;With a nuclear response like this I fully expect this girl had several more ""incidents"" to come. Maybe I'm left out on a history of shitty behavior in response to reasonable parenting but this kind of absolute ""NO DATING MY DAUGHTER IS PURE MAGICAL UNICORN VIRGIN"" is bullcrap.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, and make her the butt of every single joke from every single person for the next few years.

I mean, if you're on Facebook trying to get pictures from a supposedly teenage/adult girl, you're already looking a little shifty, so that makes sense. And she's not even threatening too much, just saying that those who the police believe were out of line will be charged according to the law. That makes sense. Right? Right, guys?

&gt;Keep in mind
&gt;
&gt;So the mum's calling peado on all the guys who tried to fuck her

If she knows that her daughter has been lying about her age then she shouldn't be turning in the names of the people who have been talking to her. I think that the punishments to the daughter are fair but I don't think it's fair to try and ruin these kids lives because your daughter is a lying whore at the age of 12.

When in the course of Circlebroke™ events it becomes necessary for ~~one people~~ mods to enforce the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of this subreddit, we will never eliminate this entirely, but we will strive to point it out when we see trends going in that direction, and that's what we have been seeing lately. So once again here is your reminder: Do not downvote per disagreement. If you disagree with someone please either flip off your monitor, or leave a civil comment as to why you disagree. And the report button isn't a mega-downvote button. It just alert's us to possible sidebar violations, so please use it to report something you feel violates either Reddit's ToS, or Circlebroke's sidebar rules. 

Circlebroke is inevitably going to complain about things that you like from time to time

**""Circlebroke is just a giant circlejerk""**

Yes we know. We've clearly stated that in both our sidebar, no one is denying that what they're complaining about may be an exaggeration. It's a subreddit meant for bitching, not the last bastion of philosophical debate on Reddit, and as such shouldn't be put up on a pedestal of how great it was or could be if we would just do things the way people bitched about it. Haqua sums it up nicely [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10ojn3/time_to_do_some_introspection_a_comment_from/c6fasej).

Circlebroke isn't here to save you! It's here to make fun of you because it's bored!

**""There's no real circlejerk here""**

This is one that has been getting thrown around more and more. Of course posts pointing out circlejerks around Reddit are, they are not necessarily mandatory. We are the Complainpire (or as some of you like to say, The Whinocracy), therefore submissions containing straight up complaining are welcome, and encouraged. Circlebroke's [first heavily upvoted submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/uakzb/i_find_myself_rooting_against_reddit_in_all/) was nothing more than a general complaint thread. 

**DAE think CB SRS LITE?**

No we are not some proxy arm of the Fempire. They have their complaints, misogyny, and sexism are welcome in /r/circlebroke as long as they adhere to our guidelines. Would SRS welcome these posts as well? I'm sure they would. Anyone with any complaint is welcome to post here. To borrow a phrase from Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, ""There is no user bigotry here. We do not look down on SRS, out of character novelty accounts, power users, or Karmanaut. Here you are all equally worthless.""

**It's getting stuffy in here**

Relax. Circlebroke is a place to complain about stupid shit on Reddit as WELL as having fun doing it. As stated before we are not the last bastion of philosophical debate on Reddit. That also doesn't mean shitting up the comment section  with reaction gifs, ENTERTAININGLY vitriolic (and sometimes even useful) discussion about reddit with a unique, descriptive title.""

**Now hiring**

As you may have noticed we have lost a few mods, and willmcdougal has moved on to greener pastures. We'd like to thank them for their contributions to /r/circlebroke over the last seven months. We've also added four new moderators ...

* CircleJerkAmbassador - Hustler Humor illustrator

* twentyone_21 - world traveler, and mandolin virtuoso. 

* lolsail - once listened to Pink Floyd's The Wall backwards while on five hits of acid

Now we are looking at adding two more. So if you would like to join the CB mod team please post in the comment section. Include subreddits you moderate (if any)

**Survey time**

It's been a while since our last survey, and some are just general CB silliness. So if you have five minutes we would appreciate your time.

1364483833.0,1b6if3,Fuck EA and SimCity! Let's boycott them! Here's Battlefield 4!,Cyril_Clunge,270,64,124,"Okay this isn't really about a circlejerk so please forgive me. The title was inspired [by this this /r/circlejerk post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1b42pu/fuck_ea_and_simcity_im_never_buying_another_game/)

What is reddit's reaction to Battlefield 4?

SimCity caused so much drama that a lot of people said things along the lines of ""don't buy another EA game. Simple. Show them the consumer has the power"". It would've been interesting to see people follow through with this.

So I put on a Hazmat suit

First up is [this post which complains about the colour of BF4](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b4n93/best_part_on_battlefield_4/).

There is only one [comment here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b4n93/best_part_on_battlefield_4/c93ocka) that mentions the EA boycott that everyone seemed so willing to do. In that thread one person says that DICE (who are making the BF games) promised things for BF3 that weren't included in the game. Which is what happened in SimCity (although at least BF3 was a lot more playable and not broken the same way SC was).

There's [this self-post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b3oxk/yay_ea_is_making_battlefield_4_no_way_lets_all/) which calls everyone out on it but OP seems to be alone.

&gt; Edit: Judging by the comments my opinion isn't popular. I just don't understand why we can't all miss out on one video game to try and do something worthwhile for once. The gaming industry is dying and it's not the corporations fault at this point. It's ours, who won't stand up to being pushed around.

Fortunately one guy did more research than I can be bothered to do

&gt; Okay

And then in another post there is [this top comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b3faz/battlefield_4_17_minutes_of_gameplay/c93aizc) which says

&gt; FUCK EA - I'M NEVER GOING TO BUY A GAME FROM THAT FUCKING COMPANY AGAIN AFTER THE SHIT THEY PULLED WITH SIMCITY!!!! BOOOOOOOOOYYYYCOOOOOOOOTTTT!!!!
.. .. ..

&gt;Two weeks later:

-------------------------------

**My opinion:**

Seriously? That's how low Reddit will fall? When someone comes over here, memes which were funny the first 1000 times they were posted, stuff ""considered old by even ebaumsworld in 2007"" (*quote by ForeverPandering on YouTube*), what would they think? How do you explain to them that that is not who we really are when it looks like we are? 

I expect admins to do something, not a discussion, not even a damn *flame war*, this is hate speech, prohibited by Reddiquette and all possible internet etiquettes, everywhere on the internet (except maybe 4chan's /b/ and similar boards), and the admins are sitting there probably saying ""haha let's do nothing about it""?! **For fucks sake, even as an atheist

These guys are sending a wrong image about reddit to the public. I believe that, exploiting their popularity and being massive jerks. *I don't give a fuck if it means ""oppressing someone's freedoms"" - these guys are prime example of oppression*. I don't care if they jerk around in their own subreddit, but when it spills over to another subreddits, that's where I draw the line.

1374958585.0,1j6ggk,How to make a Jerkometer Part 2: I coded an actual jerkometer and created a new subreddit for it,acetylserine,241,40,51,"Welcome circlebrokers, you can tell by the slightly flowery and arrogant language. You'll think your'e in /r/circlebrokecirclejerk by the end of this post I promise, but it wasn't very good and had many problems. but it wasn't really a jerkometer

So

Measuring current jerkiness:
The basic idea is that you look through the 25 latest comments of a subreddit (supplied on the /comments page of that subreddit) and test each of these comments for the presence of one or more jerk indicator. The jerk indicators are phrases compiled [manually] into a list beforehand (more on that later) which, increment the jerk rating of that subreddit, until you've looked through all of these 25 comments.

What my jerkometer does:
Every 30 seconds (or some other interval), atheismrebooted, etc.). We also want to see the actual jerks going on though, not just the intensity, so every time the jerk rating of a subreddit is measured, a list of the actual jerk indicators found is appended to a report text file generated for each subreddit in the testing list. Each recording is separated by a horizontal rule so that we can see where each recording begins and ends. 

so, but this list was just a base to start on -  it was not yet a jerk indicator list, and i quickly saw to that. Some of the phrases indicate when redditors are congratulating each other for having the same opinions, with phrases such as 'i agree', 'my thoughts exactly' and 'agreed.' while some indicate strong opinions such as 'fucking disgrace', 'sickening'. 'killed on the spot' (an invocation) and 'yet nothing will be done' (seen in your average nsa jerk for example). Many phrases are jerk subjects such as 'xbox one', 'atheism', 'edison' and 'zimmerman'. You might say that merely mentioning the word 'religion' isn't indicative of a jerk and your'e right. However, and remove any jerk indicators which have this problem. The number of false positives is small enough that we don't have to worry. A similar problem is redundance (e.g. 'faith in humanity' flags up both of the indicators 'faith' for religion-based jerks and 'faith in humanity' as the overused phrase

Now your'e getting bored and you want to see my jerk indicator list and you want to see some results and then maybe some discussion of them. You may even want to see the jerkometer code. There's quite a lot of data, the jerk indicator list and some resultant data. DON'T GO ON THAT SUBREDDIT YET OR YOU'LL RUIN THIS POST FOR YOU. That's why I omitted the initial forward slash. the first thing i want you to do is look at my jerk indicator list here, and only look at [this list](https://pay.reddit.com/r/jerkometer/comments/1j5lbg/jerk_indicator_list/), nothing else. Note that I did nick the circlebroke theme but it was lovingly done so forgive me, and who's going to see it apart from you lot anyway.

Seen it? Then i'll continue. If you are wondering why i have or havn't included a particular phrase as a jerk indicator, it was on /r/atheism and i got this:

    faith
    christian
    atheism
    atheism
    nsa
    christian
    atheism
    faith
    violence
    christian
    religion
    atheism
    said it best
    faith
    faith
    religion

...almost like i've distilled the subreddit down to a few words isn't it (wait though, I waited a minute then ran it again and got this:

    faith
    christian
    cosmos
    dawkins
    cosmos
    christian
    gold
    religion
    atheism
    religion
    atheism
    sir
    religion
    faith
    atheism

Yay, what's that...by Sagan...a genuine 'Cosmos' found out in the wild! They must have been talking about their childhood inspirations again. Encouraging results, so I tried another subreddit. Before I show you the results, I want to assure you that i had tested the code and debugged it until it was running perfectly so these are real results and nothing is wrong, people on /r/atheism really do say the words 'faith' and 'religion' that much (actually it turns out that usually it's much more). So, testing the code on /r/conspiracy got me the following:

    ftfy
    nsa
    religious
    american
    citation
    american
    amendment
    gay people
    founding father
    congress
    extremist
    zimmerman
    religious
    american
    lobby
    wealthy elite
    gay people

Now you can better see the effect of having all the 'jerk subject' indicators in the mix because we can see the jerk itself. **It's a case of many weak fibres joining together to make a strong cable**. if we had just one person mention the word 'congress' then we'd see that it wasn't a jerk and so this noise would cancel out  when compared to the number of times 'congress' might be mentioned in an actual jerk. It's like a loose, is one of the reasons that this jerkometer works. I can see how 'we can see the jerk itself' might not be convincing to you at this stage, with this meagre data set, but it is clear with the current code and jerk indicator list but WAIT don't look at it yet. just get a feeling for how you can sort of gaugue where the jerk is on the spectrum of all jerks, purely by looking at the list of words and which words are repeated most (and that's what a good jerkometer should do). if you've cheated and looked ahead at the data by now, then your'e morality is bad, and you should...know the rest of this meme. After I did all of this by the way, so in the subsequent versions of the code

There's something else I wanted to point out about the interval between jerkometer recordings

*Note that you'll want to download the album for a larger and clearer view of the graph.*

Yep, the list of subreddits the jerkometer was being run on is as follows:

""AskReddit"", ""books"", ""gaming"", ""piano"", ""lifeprotips"", ""IAmA"", ""futurology"", ""technology"", ""news"", ""wtf""

That, some of which i quite like. Looking at the graph, you can instantly see some trends present. By correlating these with the individual subreddit jerk indicator reports, we can discover...many things. Before I talk about those though, there's that recording interval thing I wanted to point out. The recordings are taken every 30 seconds. If the entire /comments page for a subreddit is not completely refilled every 30 seconds then, we will get jerk indicators from the same comments showing up in consecutive recordings. This is intentional, because if no more comments are being made, e.g. it would level out at some number for consecutive readings, we might get a dramatic increase or decrease and any trends would be difficult to spot as a result. Luckily it is usually the steady change, finally

-----

**Discussion of Results**

For this bit, so i want to get this done, which means that I won't be able to discuss the results as much as i'd like so i'll let you do most of the thinking. here are my first impressions anyway.

-----

**surprisingly unjerky subreddits**

/r/AskReddit, which is either an indicator that my jerkometer is up the spout, or that my presumptions were  bad. As it happens, those subreddits aren't that jerky if you have a look. Our general impression of their shittiness comes about from the fact that there are pun threads EVERYWHERE and consistently in the top comments too. Ooh, a picture of a woman snapped in half under a car? [Let's make puns about her flexibility!](https://pay.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1j5tav/a_horrible_accident_nsfw/cbbficl)' for example. Pun threads aren't really circlejerks so that's fine (maybe you might disagree though). Anyhow, there's no way I can quickly or easily write something to detect pun threads, given their ecelectic range of subjects. /r/music is another surprisingly unjerky one. I think this could be due to my unfamiliarity with its common jerks, don't keep quiet about it!


-----

**surprisingly jerky subreddits**

i like /r/explainlikeiama a lot, it's quite jerky. Must be in the replies. Still not sure how jerky it actually is. /r/futurology also is much jerkier than I expected. I'm not sure what to say about that because unless you often visit it you wouldn't know whether this is true or not. 


-----

**/r/atheism and /r/atheismrebooted**

you knew this was coming. In my last post here, because of this I would be surprised if I found otherwise. It is actually a testament to the powerful jerkiness of /r/atheismrebooted that it can at times outjerk even its progenitor.

-----

**but what about the intentional circlejerks?**

Why didn't I test the jerkometer on subreddits that are supposed to be jerky, and i didn't feel that it was very useful because, and this may shock you, in normal subreddits people don't really make comments in which the word 'this' is repeated forty times. It's worth saying though that if you do test it out, /r/circlejerk is impressively, and suitably, jerky. Whether it outjerks /r/atheism though is something we'll have to investigate at a later time.

**the most all-consuming jerk on reddit**

We know that the NSA jerk is everywhere. It was commented here the other day that this jerk alone could provide circlebroke with enough material to last the whole month. Seeing snowden and the NSA mentioned as many times as it is though was still quite an eye-opener. Have a look and see.

1365790135.0,1c7xxs,"Some redditors realize that celebrities use AMA to promote their own work, not because they’re so awesome and influential. Delusions of grandeur are quashed, egos decimated, and outage follows",familyorfriends,65

Note: I really rushed this

Thing is

They’re mad because they didn’t get their end of the ""social media promotion bargaining transaction"". Celebrities promote themselves and their work and  boring, the redditors get their 30 seconds of feeling special and a break from their horribly mundane and oppressively average life. 

Contrast the Morgan Freeman or Woody Harrelson AMA with some of the more successful AMAs in the past. The first Louis CK one where he was transparently promoting his digital comedy release, but they did it in a way that feed into the egos of the users. “Yeah I’m here to promote some shit but I’m *really* here with you cool folks because you’re so awesome and cool and hilarious”. Right. 

The reality is that redditors are OK with using ama to promote yourself

Celebrities use social media and their fans egos to promote themselves. This is a big factor of why twitter is so popular. The chance that anyone from Joss Whedon or Kim Kardashian will interact with something you do or say makes you feel great and important and creates tons of good will for the celebrities brand. This makes you rush to give them their money. 

But when you strip everything away, you’re not special, they get really, really mad and really really angry. 

Granted, you're not fucking special. 

I'd like to end it with some famous and wise words:

Let’s focus on the film people. 

edit: Because the mods want quotes

&gt;The problem is that the titles says ""I am Morgan Freeman Ask Me Anything"", it should be removed entirely.

&gt;EDIT: To everyone saying ""everyone lies on Reddit"": you need to realize that this subreddit is supposed to require adequate proof. Legitimate proof if what separates /r/iama from the rest of Reddit.

I'd bet the vast majority of these things are filtered through a PR rep or social media person. I know someone who was involved with a pretty successful AMA in the past year and that's how it was done.

&gt;Hey

&gt;This isn't about a celebrity owing anyone anything

Yes

&gt;You don't need to come here with a product or something to make AMA worth it. If you do a good AMA that can and will be good publicity. I'll walk by the cinema or see a commercial: ""Hmm, i'll check this shit out"" ( Wheter that means actually seeing or purchasing the product, or checking out via trailers. In any case you make me think POSITIVELY of you &amp; your work. I personally am a fan of Depp &amp; Downey Jr &amp; I check out their work just because I think they are really cool. Make a good AMA, make me a fan of yours. Hell, before Snoop Doggs ( Lion ) AMA, I did not really know much or care much about his music, but after that I checked it out and some stuff found their place on my playlists. Hell

If you do an AMA and I like you I might actually pirate your work!

&gt;I scanned this thread and am confused as to why the OP is getting so much hate.

&gt;This subreddit is abused by celebrities touting new movies, CEO's for companies trying to counteract negative social media and ...
well ... basically people trying to manipulate redditors to make a buck or get elected.

&gt;This has been a big trend lately

Too bad

&gt;The proof image was manipulated. Mods andOR admins took money for the stunt no question.
Yeah it was doctored. I loaded it into Photoforensics and the way the details on the paper appear white

&gt;http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=f338dad45bd44f470440ca38ea7c62c87b749f6e.329624

Or maybe

Also

&gt;Alright

Okay

&gt;What sucks the most is that A.) He didn't kill the crooked cops that he wanted to B.) He killed one cop and injured another that were just doing their jobs.

Again

&gt;If I were writing the movie I'd make him start the fire. He'd have a few of the scuba tanks he was seen filling. He'd dig a pit in a corner and bury himself after setting the upper floors on fire. The heat rises so he wouldn't burn and the scuba tanks would ensure he had air. Once the firemen show up he'd rise from his shallow pit take out a firefighter and then steal his clothes to make his escape in the chaos. 

This isn't a movie, but can we not have people saying ""this'd make a great movie"" after several innocent people have been injured or killed?

Bonus time!
Redditors also can't seem to agree whether or not tear gas could start a fire (the term 'burners' is agreed to refer to hot tear gas canisters)

&gt;just heard on the news from some spokesman that a tear gas grenade started the fire. Hmmm

and

&gt;Same shit happened at Waco

As opposed to...

&gt;They are gas canisters (tear gas). There are 'cold' canisters and 'hot' canisters. The hots combust more dramatically than colds and have been known to start fires. I heard somewhere earlier that hots aren't meant to be used firing into a building.

and

&gt;Likely the same CS gas used during the WACO raid that ""accidentially"" started the fires that killed everyone inside.

* **Why does this subreddit exist?** – This subreddit was created when r/atheism did their Faces of Atheism stunt.  The absolutely insane levels of smug caused waves of people in r/circlejerk to break character and talk about how insane these people must be.  Dhamster took it upon himself to create a subreddit where people could complain about things they didn’t like on Reddit without using satire.  We’ve implemented rules and guidelines over time to help build and keep the subreddit organized.  Think of this place like a more whiney /r/theoryofreddit  or a more serious /r/circlejerk .

* **So do you all just hate Reddit?  What's the point in even being here? -** No

* **Why is there a Circlebroke 2?**  - Circlebroke 2 is more or less what Circlebroke 1 was in its early days.  Complain about whatever you want
  
* **Why are there so many mods in Circlebroke 2?**  - No real reason.  Dhamster just kind of threw a bunch of us in there when he first made the subreddit.  Maybe as a thank you for helping build the sub in the first place.  Maybe just so he wouldn’t have to do any work in there.  Try not to think too much about it.

* **So what do I do in Circlebroke exactly?**  - This is a place to vent.  If you see something that regularly happens on Reddit or something that has gotten a lot of attention that frustrates you, try to give us as much to work with as possible.  A submission that has nothing but a link and one line of text isn’t going to generate a lot of discussion and we may tag it with negative flair or just remove it altogether.  [This is an example of what we SHOULDN'T be seeing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yja7f/retro_in_which_the_hivemind_gloats_how_superior/c5wgdkb)  What happened is explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yja7f/retro_in_which_the_hivemind_gloats_how_superior/c5whl8s)

* **Yeah, and we ban people that can’t talk to other people in this subreddit without resorting to childish name calling.  The flair is meant to encourage people to put some effort into their posts.  We’d like this place to have as much discussion as possible.  If you just want to say “fuck this post, amirite!?”  And are looking for somewhat of the same response, that’s what Circlebroke 2 is for.  You have options.  There's even a /r/circlebrokecirclejerk if you wanna say ""fuck this place"" and just make fun of us.  We also arbitrarily tag posts we like and would like to see more of with Quality Post flair.  There are a few users that have special image flair for their contributions to the subreddit as well.

* **Why can't I complain about /r/atheism or /r/politics  whenever I feel like it?** - Before we started organizing this sub, you're free to take your post over to /r/circlebroke2.  Adding on to that, try not to cling too much to the low hanging fruit.  If you see a handful of posts talking about a specific idea or subreddit, give it some time to digest and come back to that argument at a later time.  For instance, even though it's a somewhat obscure subreddit, we recently had a large influx of posts about /r/childfree in a very short span of time.  Use the search bar and see how recent your idea has been talked about.  We'd rather not have to make any more megathreads.

*EDIT:* We have since made some changes with regards to the megathreads.  Check to see which ones are currently active.  

* **Why are some of you orange?** – That’s our Helvetica flair.  We give it occasionally to users that submit quality content on a regular basis.  Sort of a way of saying, but if you’re interested in it, bring a few examples to us in modmail and we’ll see where we go from there.

* **What if I don’t want to just circlejerk over something?  Can I argue against things posted in here?** - YES!  In fact, as it’s of course anonymous, but we like to see people arguing topics in here.  It doesn’t have to be a black and white issue of “The hive mind is wrong because this is the right answer.”  HOWEVER, if you come into our subreddit insulting people for their views because you think Circlebroke is too uptight or whiney, we will ban you for fighting words.  We *know* that this place is oftentimes a circlejerk.  In a place meant for complaining, you're oftentimes going to find people in the comments that are upset with the same thing.  

* **What if I have a concern about the subreddit itself?  Can I make a [META] post or any other sort of post discussing the subreddit itself?**  No.  No you cannot.  This subreddit has gotten far too many [META] posts since its inception to the point that he had to ban them.  If you have a concern about the way the subreddit is run

* **I’ve found

* **Wait, skip past it and look for a post talking about a different subreddit, or better yet, make the kind of post you want to see in the subreddit.  Be the change, don’t just complain about other people not entertaining you properly.  Just don’t do it in a [META] post.  With regards to SRS though, we do not ban people for breaking the circlejerk, we do not have a stylesheet full of image macros and emotes, a number of our subscribers *do* frequent SRS and we have no issue with them.  We have no issue with ANYONE that subscribes to this subreddit so long as they follow the rules.  

* Following up on that, a novelty account, or a power user, leave that at the door.  We *will* ban in-character trolls and novelties and if we see people starting drama with power users solely because they have popular usernames, those people will be removed as well. 

* Following up on THAT we do not attack individual users in or linked to this subreddit, and don't go into threads linked here for the purpose of mocking people.  And **NO** vote brigading!  Stay out of other people's comment section, unless you plan on joining in on the conversation like any other subscriber would.  That gives Circlebroke a bad reputation that we don't want.

&gt;Her apathy during that scene disgust me. It's like she doesn't care and the kids will suffer.

More like not causing a big unprofessional scene by arguing with the student. He was obviously disrupting class

&gt; He's right. The education system is broken. I hated school more than anything. Some teachers just shouldn't be where they are. What creativity I had in my early teens was drained from my soul by my teachers and the endless homework that was shoved down my throat. You know the way some people say that your school years are the best years of your life? They lied. It's bullshit. 

""Hey, this poor poor redditor had all of his creativity drained from his broken soul! And homework? God forbid teachers assign you homework. School's not supposed to be easy. 

Then there's this voice of reason:

&gt;Jeff dropped out of school and came back. He is NOT in a regular classroom. He is in a ""go at your own pace"" class for credit retrieval. It is a class with like 30 kids in it who are all at different points in their high school career - they are all working at different grade levels and different subjects. It would be impossible to teach this class through traditional means. Hence

Here we go. This is the crucial information we lacked before, but turned his back on it. Now he's in a classroom with different people at all kinds of levels, and he complains about the teaching methods?

&gt;""Could have expressed his views in a more appropriate way"". Like a way that would have been ignored and not brought unwanted attention on their lazy teachers.

The only reason this got attention was because it went viral. Instead of rushing to the front of the room and disrupting the class, or with any other staff member. Dramatic? Sure. That's why it's gotten this much attention. Wrongly executed? Absolutely.

With that being said

It's a persecution complex not entirely unlike the ""check your privilege"" response from the obese- they don't want to change their habits and want to feel justified about what they enjoy.  Today

**[Why is it socially acceptable to watch hours upon hours of TV &amp; Netflix

Well, because I don't think you can possibly maintain that kind of intake with work/school and a social life- one has to go.

The OP goes on to say that
&gt;My roomates used to call me a nerd and anti-social because I would rather play games in my spare time than sit on the couch all day like they did and watch re-runs of sitcoms. What are some rebuttals?
 
To be fair, which makes him assign untrue traits to the roommates in question.  In his mind, watching reruns of sitcoms is just as solitary an activity as gaming tends to be, but in my experience it's the opposite.

Last year, Supernatural, 30 Rock, etc., and we bonded quite a bit by sharing the experience.  I personally love each of those shows, so most of them were re-runs to me, but I didn't care; watching them with my roommates was an entirely different experience to watching them alone.

The other thing that the OP (and many people in the thread) are missing is that sitcoms are meant to be more of a shared experience than most games are- not knowing what happend on last night's episode of the Office is a much more socially-isolating incident than not being able to talk about how cool Skyrim is.

The top comment in the thread doesn't offer advice to the OP as to how, but instead explains that gaming is more interactive than watching TV.  He does make the point that society can see gaming as having too much effort put into it for minimal returns, but I don't really think that that's the case.  After all, how many college freshmen don't love hold at least a few Call of Duty marathons per semester?

Then we get this beauty a bit further down: 

&gt;[People who spend 6+ hours a day on Facebook are 'being social'. People who spend 6+ hours a day on WoW are pathetic nerdlosers who will die foreveralone virgins. At least that's what everyone who doesn't play WoW and spends all day on Facebook seems to think

Let me be clear: there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to spend SIX HOURS on Facebook and be considered social.  I'd go so far as to say that the more you see someone on Facebook, Facebook is nothing like actually being with friends.

Right, in the real world, that's a real small percentage of the population that's that precocious on their instrument.

&gt;This girl is well on her way, for instance, because I'm shit at it and don't have a clue, even if it is fairly basic technique in the eyes of the woodworker. It's just a matter of perspective - what's amazing to one person might be less than spectacular to another.

Look, and I would've killed to have this skill level.  People that are bitching need to remember *she's a fourteen year old girl* and wipes the floor with lots of guitarists already.  Plenty of folks don't make it past G C D and ""Smoke on the Water"".  Reading all the armchair criticism is why I really hate Reddit sometimes.  And yet I still peruse this place.  Maybe *I'm* the butthurt one.

[On the one hand](http://i.imgur.com/dZLzm.gif) you have the people crying repost and karma whore

[On the other hand](http://i.imgur.com/8lvr0.png) you have the people that argue that Reddit is composed of some 35 million plus unique monthly visitors that don't all spend their lives scouring every corner of this website

But what doesn't get talked about too often ([outside of that whole Trapped_in_Reddit incident from a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vefen/recap_trapped_in_reddits_witch_hunt/)) is the acceptance of reposted comments.

[In reaction to finding out this is a repost we have a series of constantly reposted reaction and vote gifs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12gb1j/murder_murder_murder_snuggle/c6ut7dm)

I noticed in /r/circlebroke2 recently a post pointing out the repetitive reaction to people's usernames and or novelty accounts.  A lot of people are aware already that Shitty_Watercolour's posts are usually responded to with comments that he reminds them of [Quentin Blake](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/1055q4/i_am_shitty_watercolour_ask_me_anything/c6ahrio).  

[In this particular post that I mentioned a moment ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/12dmkd/cb1_was_too_good_for_my_effort_post_apparently_so/)

Finally there's the consistently witch-hunted users, it's been tossed back and forth on SRD enough by now. 

So what is the reason behind this acceptance?  Is it because less people read the comment section and that the comment section is too large to keep track of how often things have been posted?  Is it because witch hunting is a past time on Reddit and regardless of how often something is said and how little it has to do with the topic, Sagan knows they're used ad nauseum?  And the reaction to people's usernames like [nota](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11klqj/that_poor_child/c6ncut2)methaddict, [POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/x0u8n/a_challenge_for_potatoe_in_my_anus_fixed/), and drunk_otter ([who got so many of the same comments that he began compiling them into his own subreddit,](http://www.reddit.com/r/youredrunkotter/)) why do those get consistently upvoted?

I support marijuana legalization.  I see nothing wrong with the recreational use of pot.  I trust the credible evidence that marijuana has tangible benefits for medicinal purposes.  I'm sure the DEA is as awful as everyone says.  Mandatory minimum sentences are stupid.  I don't doubt that the strange banishment of the hemp industry in America has harmed the nation.  And so on

Marijuana itself isn't my problem.  I'm here today to discuss marijuana's fan club.

Just like everyone else reading this, topically focused subreddits.  For a while I was satisfied with this, but it got to be a bit boring due to the homogeneity of the posts; part of the appeal of reddit in the first place was being exposed to the highlights of topics I might not generally give a lot of thought and time.  As a result, I began to wander over to /r/all after I'd skim the stuff on my front page.

This gave me an opportunity to be annoyed once again with all of the usual suspects, I feel like I've spent more time shaking my head and sighing at the drivel that comes from /r/trees than anywhere else.

I suppose their trespasses are mostly overlooked because they're not offensive in a way that's particularly shocking or personal.  They're just a bunch of ""easy going"" stoners trying to have a good time

But

You know how people who have just discovered alcohol become pretty obnoxious?  Like

Reasonable people grow out of this pretty quickly.  /r/trees

How many fucking anecdotes can these people share about how wacky and zany and ridiculous their perspective on the world becomes while high off their tits?  SO GUYS

You know what?  Actually, because you have to make it clear how fucking stoned you were.  Because, lol, you were sooooo fucking stoned.

Oh, they have multiple overlapping slang terms for just about everything they do.  What's the point?  Maybe it stems (LOL MARIJUANA PUN) from the need to be discreet while talking about illegal drug usage or something, but I'm certain they only do this shit now because it's part of their not-so-secret club that makes them feel cool and special.  It's silly.

Just about every day there's a picture on /r/all of some pothead's unreasonably huge stash of marijuana.  Why is this interesting?  So

Something else I don't get about these idiots is their obsession with drug paraphernalia.  A reasonable person would buy a bong or a bowl or a vaporizer or some rolling papers and get high and leave it at that.  But, ornate bongs?  Like, some of these guys have entire rooms filled with this ugly, tacky shit.  Everyone needs a hobby I guess, but holy fuck is this one stupid.  Worse yet, though, they often *name* their ""pieces.""  And the names are typically unsurprisingly uncreative.  MY EPIC FIVE FOOT LONG WATER PIPE IS ORANGE AND BLUE SO I NAMED HIM ""ORANGEY BLUEY.""  SAY HELLO

I thought I'd have a lot more to rant about, but that's beyond the scope of what I want to talk about right now.  At the moment I'm just pissed off about how fucking boring these people are.  I have no idea why, but this repetitive garbage routinely garners an excess of upvotes sufficient to send their collective ""culture"" rocketing to the top of the entirety of reddit.  How does this happen?  Why are so many people so fucking excited for the most dull aspects of weed?

I'm not saying this story isn't true, the person who witnessed it in action decided to turn it into a sideshow attraction of a paragraph and post it on a website for the entertainment of complete strangers, who then proceeded to speculate what kind of noise the chicken made when it was pulled out of her bodily crevices.

It started off reasonably enough:
&gt;The United States used the Soviet Union as an anti-ideal, we've lost our way.

A fair perspective to hold.  Let's check out the replies:

&gt;Look at capitalism in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Irish being treated like scum etc. Things started improving right around the time the rich and powerful became genuinely concerned about that whole ""worldwide revolution"" thing the USSR was trying to export.
Now that it collapsed and communism is seen as a joke rather than as a valid counter-ideology to capitalism we'll be seeing (and are seeing) a natural regression back to low standards of living.

The only reason that The Man allowed your lives to improve during the 20th century was because communism.

Why did my ancestors from Norway even bother coming here in the first place?  They already lived in paradise!

Now it's time to kick the jerk into high gear:

&gt;One time I asked a Russian friend
She replied

And then this BRAVE reply:

&gt;Because most Russians understand that noone won. Both sides spend tens of trillions of dollars on pointless military hardware
Think if that money had been spent on healthcare or medicine research
Both America and Russia lost the cold war. The cold war itself was losing.

So the Soviet Union collapsed and America became the world's sole superpower after the Cold War.  But America totally did not win

&gt;This is common knowledge. USSR was never as powerful as they were portrayed. It was nothing but American propaganda.

Even if America did win the Cold War,000 nukes.  America was the real bully here.

[This link](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11n36a/8000yrold_carvings_in_stone_destroyed_in_moroccos/) in r/worldnews alleged that Muslims in Morocco destroyed some ancient artifact that no one in the thread even knew existed until they were given a chance to be outraged over it. 

The post garnered almost 3, when I was in the heat of this submission, the ""best"" comments were a lot worse than they are now - they seem to have been slightly moderated over the past weeks. But you don't have to look hard to find the most outrageous, intolerant, misguided anti-Islam sentiment I think I've ever heard, and I've been on some pretty intolerant websites. In fact, sorted by ""top

But [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11n36a/8000yrold_carvings_in_stone_destroyed_in_moroccos/c6nxfh5) fucking guy really takes the cake. He actually says, but of course I was downvoted and did not receive a single response that agreed with me (although one guy did PM me saying he appreciated my efforts.)

Of course, the messages have already been made and agreed with, the hatred has been propagated, their karma is still through the roof, and, for a long time, when this post actually mattered and people read it

Fortunately, so the whole thing must be true and everything is verified, we have a right to call for the murder of these people. Trust him, the locals are *pissed.* Trust him, he's a *specialist.*

So here's where things really get interesting. Not only did Reddit display its true colors without even the mere suggestion that they should verify themselves (and had ""specialists"" on hand to re-assure us that the ""locals were pissed""), this revision only receives about 120 net upvotes, and has a small fraction of the comment base. Most of the comments here are pointing out how absurd it was that Reddit jumped on this issue in the first place, and the comments doing so in the original post have since been significantly upvoted. But, as someone in the second post commented, the damage has already been done. And it was done *severely.* I was legitimately worried about the future of the Western population that they could succumb so quickly, severely, going so far as to call for the extermination of a culture. All over something that **didn't even happen.** It was like the scary anti-Islam bias after 9/11

Occasionally, will be surprised by the fearsome spectre, rising scaly-coated from the depths, of an opinion they disagree with.

See then the herd react in startled fear, sleek-spined antlers outwards to ward off any threat! 

Eventually, steps forward and lays their fears to rest. This crocodile of difference, this dreadful predator, is nothing to be feared - it is not *really* a differing opinion, but merely a ""shill"".

Emboldened by the knowledge that they don't have to question their worldview

""What is a shill?"", or is sent by dark and secret interests to spread duplicitous viewpoints. Unlike ""real"" Redditors, who have no prior opinions or agenda about anything, a shill seeks to pervert discussion by lies and tricks. When seeking to dismiss opinions that on disagrees with, it is sufficient to term them ""shillery"" or ""psyops"" or ""Jew lies (why does it make me anti-semitic to criticize Israel?)"", and then they can be ignored. If something might be shillery, you don't really need to engage with its arguments

This is a frequent occurence - whether it is a lone dissenting voice in the stampede, in which various staunch Redditors agree that literally the only reason someone might have a different conception of the whole Assange situation than they do is because the US government and the New York Times are paying them to express such lies.

2. It is indicative of an incredibly gullible, asking for proof of it is evidence that the asker is themselves a shill. 

The aggregate opinion of this many people shouldn't be this stupid, supported by a lack of evidence, the accusers silence and sideline disagreement, and this is one of the many factors which contributes to the dearth of discussion, particularly on the larger subreddits.

...

&gt;Where have you been? Faggot no longer is slandering gay men. It never started as one and it shouldn't have ever become one. Faggot is constantly changing meanings

...

&gt;Do people use ""faggot"" as a non-derogatory word? Is ""faggot"" usually used as a way to refer to themselves as a homosexual? If anything, kinda.

...

&gt;I feel like this is one of those words that has been turned into a synonym for 'asshole' or 'douche'...not justifying nor saying it's not offensive to homosexuals but I think it's become an every day word for most people.

Ah Louis C.K. Of course! His word is gospel! DAE watch Louis?!?! The straight, so...it's okay!

&gt;For some reason I doubt your claim. I've known many gay men and none of them were ever offended by the use of the word faggot. In fact they would often use it their selves.

You doubt that someone is offended by the use of the word faggot? Because anecdotal evidence says gay people aren't! All 1 of my gay friends aren't offended

Some gay people probably aren't offended by it. But not all gay people find it inoffensive.

Now, the first reputable source being Al Jazeera. They're someone's facebook page, a Twitter, a Tumblr account. None of it is from an actual news organization. In the case of the iReport, it's all unsourced claims (nothing better then a rumor,) with 2000 upvotes. The tweet is the same deal. The Facebook and Tumblr aren't quite so bad, but they're social media, there's information from decent news organizations below these

This is merely an example of a problem that I've seen running rampant in /r/worldnews

In addition,) but it can still be very problematic. First, there's no one checking that the information is true. Mainstream media have a reputation to uphold, a random guy on Facebook does not. In the case of pictures and videos, there's no context. Now, there's *definitely* a place for this, but you've got to be very careful when trusting information you find on Faecbook.

This problem is by no means unique to what's happening today. /r/worldnews loves sensationalism, these 'journalists' have no reputation to uphold. Mainstream journalists are careful not to deliberately report misinformation or speculation, as it would ruin their reputation. Citizen journalists do not have a reputation to uphold, so there's nothing stopping them from reporting misinformation, speculation and rumors. Probably the best example of this was the [great nuclear disaster coverup of 2012](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/). The problem is that these sources are highly upvoted, and there's absolutely nobody questioning them in the comments. This is a problem. 

There's also a problem that this can lead to the importance and consequences of a story being overblown by these citizen journalists. I'm not going to speculate about what'll happen to this story (we'll need hindsight for that.) 

Is this an important story? Definitely. But it's extremely problematic when a major source of information on /r/worldnews is people's blogs and Twitters.

From this first comment

&gt;This needs to be at the top. ""Think of the children"" politics are to blame for a system that is proven to be ineffective and in many cases unjust (if a 17 year old sleeps with an 18 year old the 18 year old's life can be ruined because of the registry

Although there is an obvious lack of...anything beyond this single unsupported sentence here, ladies and gentleman, this second comment thread gets derailed in short order by reddit's second favorite sex-offender-hero, the public urinator:

I pee in public like it is going out of style--when reading reddit I feel amazed that I have not made it onto America's Most Wanted for this behavior. 

Supporting this jerk is one of the blandest anecdotes regarding cops and urination that has ever been shared on teh internet: 

&gt;I didn't know how severe peeing in public was until a few years ago. When I was a senior in high school, a cop shined a light on me and we had a small exchange.

&gt;Cop: I'm going to have to take you in for peeing in public Me: I didn't pee in public Cop: I just saw you Me: No, it wouldn't be hard to spot the yellow stained snow. Cop: ...okay, have a good evening, stay out of trouble

[+535]

  &gt;[China is what happens when you take a bunch of agrarian peasants, force the rest to pay lip service to complete bullshit for a couple of generations so nobody can even remember what sanity was, and then suddenly throw them into the 20th century. Not the 21st, mind you, the 20th.

This post has currently 871 points and I personally think it’s beyond most things I have seen on reddit, wow really? For the rest, I don’t even know how to structure a text with all the things I have to complain about, so I make a short list instead:

  * **China was completely unchanged for thousands of years.** This is a term that is used way too much when Westerners shall describe a society that hasn’t had the same technological development as the European world. Assumptions are always made that the relatively slow technological improvement is a sign of a completely stagnant and in all aspects backwards society.

  * **Chinese people are less intelligent because those who were intelligent were executed.** The communist government did target academics and intellectuals

  * **China is STILL IN THE 20TH CENTURY!!!** Yet another childish example of the notion that the development of a society is measured along a one-dimensional scale where the development of the western world serves as some kind of SI unit.

  * **Chinese people have no sanity.** That’s basically what he says. I don’t even feel like commenting on that. And now for his wonderful analogy:
  * **What if someone killed everyone in the United States except the dumb ones (Southerners

  This redditor was nice enough to fight the semi-racism by pointing out that rural people are stupid everywhere!

  &gt;[Not only in the south. It's not just southerners. Rural ignorance exists in every state.

BUT. /r/technology's fucking bitching is insufferable at the moment. The way they go on, what's on the front page now? ""Just arrived in Belgium from Canada... Is this seriously what Europe has come to?"" What is the poster referring to? The Pirate Bay being blocked. Yeah, because it's such a fucking travesty that you can't get movies or music. The way people go on you'd think they'd been banning political opposition speech (which is actually something these idiots think is next up, which is as great a slippery slope fallacy as I can think of).

Then there was that Game of Thrones thread. ""But I don't want to pay for cable..."" So don't watch the show or buy it on DVD when it comes out, so they're going to take it for free. Ugh.

But of course nobody wants to admit they just want free stuff. There's ridiculous arguments trotted out as to why they won't pay for things which cost money to make and distribute. ""It's the wrong codec"", and they know they're not, but they just want to make themselves feel better about not paying for something that costs money. That's all, and it's transparent. Moreover, anyone who suggests that The Pirate Bay is not necessarily a universal force for good (in that they make money off of infringing others' copyrights) gets downvoted into oblivion. It's ridiculous.

Then you get the stupid quote from Gabe Newell, repeatedly, how Steam provides a better service than iTunes/Amazon MP3 and never got a proper reply beyond some waffling (strictly speaking, iTunes provides a *better* service, as there is no DRM whatsoever on iTunes downloads now or any requirement to use the iTunes application beyond actually downloading the music - Amazon MP3 doesn't even need an application to be installed). Spotify, too, provides limitless access to a wide variety of music ad-free for the price of one Steam game a month. How is that not fair? The industry are not perfect, just excuses.

But of course, let me remind you, of other peoples' work) and marvelled at the irony and circular logic of people who spend their time ripping off others' hard work and distributing it freely complaining about their hard work in ripping off hard work being ripped off and distributed. Do they seriously not see the disconnect there?

And yes, that does not in any way justify taking their products for free. Again, nobody can claim they're taking a high ground here, since virtually everyone has engaged in piracy, but stop claiming it's some sort of noble act, stop claiming you have a moral justification for it, stop claiming you want anything other than just free shit and finally stop fucking bitching when the people who actually invested money into making the stuff they're selling but you're taking for free catch wind of it and try to stop it. What else do you expect them to do? I hear talk of ""adjusting business models"" but the only business model I'm hearing suggested is one where bands make music and everyone else gets it free of charge

1343666760.0,xeceu,r/worldnews rant,orko1995,218,41,86,"I don't have any examples

You see, every link on the frontpage must be upvoted, every fundie must be called out, every republican is stupid. So I am interested in foreign affairs, so I decided to go and read /r/worldnews. At first I thought, ""Holy shit! This place is wonderful! Rather than going to every news site individually to get my news from across the world, or to wait until the evening news

Now, so there was a lot of actual news in worldnews rather than your usual circlejerks. Soon enough, reddit - like every other person reddit likes to act superior to - got bored with Libya and Japan and moved on to the regular schedule. And by ""regular schedule"" I mean rabid anti-Israel jerking. Being Israeli, it annoyed me, but it isn't anything I haven't seen anywhere else on the internet, so I just thought ""everybody had their biases"" and kept pretending /r/worldnews is a good place to get your news from. But then, as I saw more of /r/worldnews, *always*:

""Fuck Israel!"" (this is as productive as an /r/worldnews discussion gets)

""Israel is doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to the Jews!""/""Sixty years have passed and **THE JEWS** haven't learned a thing!""(apparently you major in history and international politics - not just science - when you become a brave atheist)

""This is paid for by YOUR tax dollars!""

""This is what religion does."" (Because this has everything to do with religion

""I'm not an anti-semite or anything but why are **THE JEWS** so greedy?""/""Look at those greedy Jews! BTW I can't be an anti-semite because I don't hate Arabs and they're also semites so suck it

""Those damn Zionists!"" or its variants 

""As a Jew..."" (because just being Jewish makes you an expert on the field)

""Israel is just a bully!"" (Look at me! I've read several editorialized titles in a heavily-biased website! That makes me an expert

""Just a reminder

Now, I'm Israeli, so I often look at a lot of arguments about Israel on various international forums on the internet, and I have *never* seen anyone being called an anti-semite for only criticizing Israel. Maybe once or twice, but it then it turned out that this person *was*, actually, anti-semitic

You see, but that redditors remind each other how much criticizing Israel is not anti-semitic, that they start being anti-semitic themselves. Maybe they were bigoted against Jews before, I don't know, but it seems to me like all this argument does is allow redditors to think that their bullshit opinions are not anti-semitic, then go to an Israel-related thread and spout their anti-semitic nonsense over there as much as they want, and then everyone will cheer for them while they can think of how brave they were. And if anyone points out their bigotry, and everyone will upvote them.

Redditors like to indulge in the same old tired jerks over and over, so they don't dare look around them. This, in turn, means that only things redditors are familiar with and can easily agree upon are ever upvoted, and that means that only hivemind opinions are ever seen. Then, new users see only the hivemind opinions, all the time they're on reddit, everyone on this new cool website I've found agrees on this certain point! And I have seen no dissenting opinions

This leads me to another point about /r/worldnews. The upvote/downvote system encourages only easily-digestible material to go through, actually reading the articles and not just the editorialized title on worldnews. This also means that if you're unfamiliar with a certain concept, you will not bother reading about it. Only things you know about. Does reddit actually know anything about Israeli internal politics? Or Palestinian internal politics? No, why would they? Those are complicated subjects that don't often pop up in their daily lives. Instead you have the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, something that redditors have easily made their minds about. That is also why you will never see posts about Israel or Palestine that aren't about Israelis abusing Palestinians. 

Let me tell you something that happened to me: A few months ago, but I still thought it has some sensibility and is just really, extremely biased and that's it, so I searched for Tzipi Livni's name in /r/worldnews to see what redditors think about her resignation. Surprise surprise, there was nothing about her resignation. Instead there was easily-digestible material, where you can clearly see who's the bad guy and who's the good guy, with a *lot* of bias. Things that no Israeli has ever heard of (because they're not actually that important) but reddit jizzes over because it confirms their biases. Not a single thing about actually important stuff, that matters to people in the region

OP complains that a mother on another subreddit asked if she should put down a hard-of-hearing 13 year old dog down after it snapped at her baby. Keep in mind that she only asked a question.

&gt;What is it teaching the child if you immediately kill the dog instead of teaching your children how to respect animals?

IT'S A **BABY**

Yes

&gt;But what I cannot accept is when a pet is looked at as ""lesser"" because it's an animal

A dog is a lesser. Do you know how many dogs are euthanized daily at shelters? Would we do this to people? No, look at dogs on the same level as humans? Do we expect our dogs to make a living? This is fucking absurd. Is OP spending his/her free time picketing pounds because they euthanize a shit ton of cats and dogs every day? Should that be equal with murder?

Dig a little deeper, and in fact some are worse.

Introducing /r/politicalhumor. Now it isn't a *small* subreddit, but it is a lot smaller than the major reddits, but it attracts an audience nearly all composed of the worst of /r/politics.

I originally was attracted to it because I thought it would feature political cartoons like [this](http://0.tqn.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/4/3/5/Inauguration-Day.jpg). Oh how wrong I was. When I find a new sub which I might subscribe too the first thing I look at is the top posts. But first impressions are important and hot posts like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Dd7yRbz.jpg)

Now let's have a look at the top voted links. Maybe the decline into macros, unfunny posts may only be a recent development. Perhaps politicalhumor was better in the past? Place your bets here.

Oops. The usual anti-republican politics was well and alive throughout /r/politicalhumor's life. The top voted links are as follows.

I would go into the comments, attract very little comment, most have less than ten on the front page, I don't think it would be worthwhile. It wouldn't be good for my health either, with the quality of the links I'd hardly expect a nuanced discussion dissecting the meaning behind these images.

The question itself leads everyone into the ""Romney bad"" immediately (with a wonderfully leading title) and sets the stage perfectly for a discussion of how terrible of a person Mitt Romney is.  Certainly his phrasing was poor and clumsy

This is the current top comment, but that doesn't make this judgement subjective.

Following that comment is a thread talking about all the single kids throughout history that were Reddit's heroes

&gt;[My jaw dropped when he started going on about ""if you're going to have women in the workforce"" you have to be flexible so they can go home and cook dinner -- and following that there was a whole spiel about in his economy employers will be ""so anxious to get good workers they’re going to be anxious to hire women."" Not sure exactly what that meant

The next comment,"" but the second part is once again warped to be seen in the worst possible light.  They act as though Romney is some sort of devilspawn who seeks to usher in the American dark ages instead of a politician who wants his shot at getting in the history books and trying to put through some of his party's legislation, which he most likely believes will help America.

Perhaps it was from the loaded question asked by former Miss America ([PS I GOOGLED HER, SHES HOT](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/100ui4/fox_and_friends_gets_punked_by_worst_interview/c69f7pg)) about unemployment among young adults:

So, mostly a bad heritage from 4chan's /fit/ board, ranging from dumb memes (DYEL) to the blind worship of Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength (at the point where any front page submitted transformation post gets ripped on for the lack of 'adequate' leg development or their lack of squats n oatz)... but the analysis of /r/fitness' jerk-culture is outside of the scope of my post, as today they've proved to be a gang of refreshingly understanding but stern people.

Let's look at this post:

[Some thoughts regarding a date I had with an overweight girl

TL;DR - OP went on a date with a girl he *really, the girl is overweight while OP isn't, so he shares with us his viewpoint on the possible reasons for this situation in a thinly-veiled rationalization / validation seeking essay.

What I expected coming in on the topic was an immature, well, fat people, instead we find this:

&gt;I'll just bring this up here: you know better. She may not. ""Pilates and Wii"" may make you think she doesn't care
If you weren't feeling it, perhaps use this opportunity to be a good influence on her health. She may have all the desire in the world to be healthier but just have no good direction.
As an anecdote, because we have a really great relationship now. [+780](http://np.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/c8yhlpk)

Or this:
&gt;Are you a dick for not sleeping with her? No, when did I start thinking like this? Am I an ass for thinking this? Yeah, you're an ass for thinking like that! You're NOT in her shoes. She's a successful, funny lawyer. Those are three qualities that are rarely found together in a functioning human being. She sounds awesome, while you sound like someone who would say this: It helps me eat well, not just well, but fucking amazingly. with a straight face! ""Fucking amazingly?"" Man, I say I ate fucking amazingly. If I cut processed grains from my diet, more pretentious and obnoxious than humble-bragging about dietary choices! Ooh

...and some:

&gt;I disagree that you're being true to yourself.
""I'm not attracted to her"" is being true to yourself. Dating is one of the few times in this life where it's perfectly acceptable to judge someone primarily on the basis of his or her appearance.
I do feel that when you bring up this notion of ""seriousness, have a word in English for ""shallow"" that has a positive connotation, even though that's exactly what I think everyone agrees should happen.
You don't want to feel that you're being shallow and disapproving of someone who's otherwise awesome on the basis of her looks (which, so you come up with this concept of ""seriousness"" to justify your choice.
""Seriousness"" is just a high horse. There's a vast wealth of fitness miscommunication in society, and it's almost a joke how we all consider ourselves experts because we read Starting Strength and don't like Zumba, when we can all remember when we didn't know, or worse knew only broscience.
Frankly, because there's always a higher horse. In fact, there's nothing to say that she couldn't achieve her general goals with what she's doing, just less effectively.

Dwelling deeper in the thread uncovers more of both attitudes, not being a prick about it and understanding both sides of the argument has prevailed. Even the OP himself on several occasions shows signs of understanding where his faults lie, and is never taking the stance of a hurt or defensive person.

I would speculate that the reason for this is that /r/fitness is a community where the barrier of entry is, in effect, that the people commenting, no matter how far they traveled on their level of interest, have a much more solid understanding of where they are, where they began, and where they are headed. It's a different ballpark from politics or atheism or cringe, despite how strong or fit they made it, but rather something refreshingly humane in a common struggle.

That's the spirit! Let's make fun of what's probably a 14 year old girl for being fat. Oh

Currently standing at -11 points is this asinine response:

&gt;Yea it's not like 4chan directly asked her to cut herself or anything! Now downvote me I can take it.

""Hahaha

But if I hook my balls up to a car battery and electrocute myself because some anonymous image board told me to

Ok, no, this is the fault of bad parenting and political correctness.  Before it, young girls were never hormonal or irrational.

&gt;Some people were born fat too. It doesn't give them extra privileges.

What does this even mean? I know the privilege thing is one of the less funny in-jokes

&gt;**Faggot** has got a point... Stupid bitches really will do this shit. Which is why I think we should stop #cuttingforbieber and bring in #suicideforbieber instead

How edgy of you.

&gt;some people are just born massive **faggot**s

There's a lot of this in the thread, they wouldn't be using it derogatorily like they are here. (I know that ""OP is a faggot"" is an unfunny in joke of its own, but that isn't what this is).

My best friend is gay. I guess that this might offend me if I thought they did it for any other reason then to get a reaction out of me

&gt;As far as I can tell, it seems most people choose the latter.

I wouldn't want to be best friends with a bunch of reaction-bating shitheads either.

&gt;&gt;and massive **faggot**ry.

&gt;More like trolling

Uh huh. Anyone who doesn't think that coercing young girls into self-harm ""for teh lulz"" is a good idea is obviously trolling.

&gt;The dude has some points actually

That one's at -5 currently. The seven downvotes I assume are due to the fact that he gave the comment referred to by the OP credit. The upvotes probably because he still called him gay.

---

I subscribe to /r/4chan because I think a lot of the stuff they produce is really funny. The greentext stories are often entertaining, but not when it actually spills over into the real world and young girls are actually harming themselves because of it. We don't have to pretend that since the product of a website is often entertainingly crass that there are no lines they shouldn't cross in the name of humor. It would be one thing to simply make fun of this stupid trend, if that's really what it was: A stupid trend, not a coordinated ""prank"". This is beyond the normal 4chan irreverence. Spamming votes to name a McDonalds sandwich the ""McHitler"" is harmless. Voting for Kim Jong Un to be Time's PoTY is harmless. Coercing tween girls into cutting themselves isn't. The fact that girls are in harms way because of this stunt is obviously no laughing matter for any sane human being. Any defense of it is going to make me think twice about any of the inappropriate humor I see coming from there from now on. As tasteless as a joke about, oh say, murder is, in the context of fiction it can still be funny. Now any time I see a post on /r/4chan making light out of a serious issue, ""wow

The very top comment gets things off to a great start with Reddit's favourite incestuous ~~pedophilia~~ ephebophilia ""humour"":

&gt; [Whatever you do

You would think the inevitability of this kind of reply would deter anybody from asking Reddit about their serious life problems. How old do you think that commenter was? Do you think he has kids of his own? His context is a mystery -- fourteen year old wit or aged

Next, and also discovered that she likes to be ritualistically abused by men!

&gt; [Okay, but there's still a lot more about the BDSM lifestyle that she needs to know that she cannot learn from that book. ...

Above all, I think

This commenter does suggest, this comment, considered the best of the ""advice"" by Reddit's voters, sees no issues with thirteen year old girls not only exploring their sexuality, but experimenting with sadomasochism. (It doesn't sound so nice when you don't euphemize it as ""BDSM"", eh?) The numbers bear it out: she's not the only one, and therefore it's totally normal and okay! And of course

&gt; [An entire thread full of more ""humour."" Herr derr

Kids are embarrassed and disgusted by their parents' sex lives? HA! Reddit's observational humour once again shines light on the hidden corners of life. The circlejerk is a beautiful testament to how quickly ""edgy"" descends into ""banal and cliche"". Redditors ride the same cliche jokes over and over for that sweet Internet attention

Note also the ""le rational Europe vs ign'ant Amerikkkans"" talk going on in these discussions. Reddit thinks it knows all about this man's life, as a parent, to manage an adolescent's growing curiosity about sex. I wonder how many of them honestly gained or grew in character from tearing off their clothes and mating the moment Mom and Dad weren't looking? But no matter.

Reddit, but also that R.Kelly can't read because he is black. Also, this should be laughed at apparently.

Here's the top comment

&gt;Hey

It's followed by many posts along the same line

&gt;He is illiterate. He does not ""suffer"" from illiteracy.

I'm not even sure what is supposed to imply. That illiteracy is just something he could fix right away if he wanted to? That learning disorders aren't causing it? That he's too rich to be sad from illiteracy? But upvoted to the moon anyway. Here's another-

&gt;This is surprisingly unsurprising

I'm guessing they think it's unsurprising because he is black and associated with ""hood"" culture

&gt;They make it sound like an incurable disease.

Well seeing how many learning disorders don't really have a known cause or very good ""cures"" it sort of is sometimes. Dyslexia has varying degrees

Also

The last one I'll put here-

&gt;I'm sure he suffers a lot... What is this, because you sure as hell can afford the tutoring, and pay extra if you want it to be discreet... he just doesn't care -_-

Because the rich are incapable of suffering or of sadness or most human emotions. Money just solves their problems. The lack of empathy and awareness and jealousy from the reddit users is simply astounding. We can pity R.Kelly even though he is rich and question a system that let him become that way.

Doesn't make sense? Good.

**Ye Social Networking**

One area where this is seen most virulently is the dichotomy surrounding Facebook. The thinking dé jour is divided. [One of the top comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12yxq7/i_still_refuse_to_watch_jay_leno_after_the/c6zdpcr) in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12yxq7/i_still_refuse_to_watch_jay_leno_after_the/) is:

&gt; I still begin all my Facebook statuses with the word ""is

Followed by an outpouring of support. However

&gt; I had already done Planet Friend, I took a stand.

My god! What a special flower! Taking a stand against...what exactly? What is it about Facebook that makes people find it so unpalatable? You can make a profile of any size

Or maybe there's something in the fact that /r/atheism so often 'owns' people on Facebook that nobody wants to go there any more. 

But then he says:

&gt; 3) I do have a full LinkedIn profile 

And the hypocrisy comes full circle. This 'boycott' isn't a principled stand; its just playing into another hipster circlejerk. Its fine to be part of *another* website that purports to do virtually exactly the same thing as Facebook

But it gets better: 

&gt; 4) I keep up with my friends via fantasy sports, and **even a phone call** 

This is one my parents used to use all the time (as I was a teenager when MSN Messenger and Facebook started up). Why not call your friends and see them? Why chat to them on this stupid website?

Because, you'd probably see your immediate community and no one else for months at a time, because the only way of communicating with people was by fucking carrier pigeon.

Now we interact with people in a far more subtle way

&gt; 5) My wife is on FB so I do get some updates

And the jerk comes full circle. So he 'boycotts' Facebook

There's a few more comments that cover things like the obscene number of friends people have:

&gt; Just slowly stop using it. And text more. The people that actually care will still talk to you. Explain you're too busy for it. Eventually they'll stop seeing you on Facebook and just not notice when you delete. That's what I did. 900 people as friends and I just up and left it. No regrets.

But here's the thing: There's no mandated number of friends. You don't *have* to have 900 people on your friends list. You can have 50. Or 5. It really doesn't matter. Saying you don't use Facebook because you can interact with too many people and that that interaction loses significance is completely redundant. Facebook is just a medium. Texting would mean equally less if you never used it

Finally

&gt; For the most part it is

And:

&gt; I do believe you have it: uninteresting tools seem convinced they are interesting people. And FB's existence is predicated on this fact.

Two things. First, the holy sage! They stole from him! Burn him!

Second

&gt; I guess I understand a little more now... You're blaming Facebook for the people you know being mindless. That's like blaming paper because Glenn Beck has written books.

Boom. Case closed.

**And then there was a great flash of tin foil hats**

I'm going to keep trawling through the comments

&gt; Their slow

Excuse me? What 'encroachment', you don't have to (and you really shouldn't).

Lo', but two faces! The first seemed innocent and inviting, filled with promises of friends and happiness, but the second sought his undoing! 'Tis a sad day to have seen his passing, but remember that ye can invest in ye Reddit Gold for ye extra benefits.

&gt; It was then when I figured how stupid it is to hand out such a subjectively and personaly valuable collection to a corporation in the first place. Not even for privacy concerns but for the simple fact

This was the point at which my palm came into contact with my face. This guy doesn't even care about privacy concerns; its just that someone else 'owns' them? If the risk is that Facebook might go down, then back up one last time.

If its just the gross feeling that someone else owns something of yours

&gt; Not to mention things have gotten to a point where anybody without a facebook is automatically viewed with suspicion by the authorities and regular folks alike. That can't be healthy for a society.

Had I been drinking milk

The only reason that people would think that not having Facebook is 'suspicious' is because the people who avoid Facebook do so in a really fucking suspicious way. They talk about how corporations want to steal their souls and how they're 'giving in' to Facebook. Nobody else thinks that way

I wonder what issues Reddit cares about?,lowkeyoh,265,96,238,"I'm going to go until I either pass out or find a decent number of posts that don't reinforce standard Reddit Jerks.  I'll only include post counts when comparing parent posts to their replies.

1.) [Deaf couple mad about double standards at friends and family not wanting to feel 'left out' in social situations](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1yuim)

Surprisingly enough the top comment is NOT a normal jerk.  Maybe this thread will be a non-circlejerkey discussion of Social Problems.

2.) [Dad's never get custody of their children

There it is.  The good old ""Men get screwed in every divorce ever because society is so filled with misandry"" jerk.  Follow up [post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1xcy3) includes the unfairness of Child Support and lack of decision over making women abort children.

3.)[Join the Army before being able to drink](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1utll)

4.)[All men are pedos](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1xxl7)

Equal Rights

8.) [Double standard on sexual promiscuity](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1ul3v]

9.)[""I want to be treated equally.. sometimes.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1vhin)

Turns into the ""White people are discriminated against too!"" jerk with a side of ""DAE LE STEM?""

13.)[Joke response involving poop](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1xvem) with pedophile joke followup

14.) [Double standard on male masturbation when it comes to sex toys](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1y3zu)

Surprised to see this here.  One of the biggest double standards when it comes to acceptance of male sexuality, but there's some good follow up comment. 

15.)[I should be able to hit uppity women

Here's a story that both totally did happen

16.)[Animals we eat are totally subjective](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1uz7v)

20.)[Men have to get drafted and women don't](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1wfa8)

Not going to link the rest because I'm getting tired but we have

Men can't hit women.  
I don't think black people understand equality.  
Period Joke.  
Scholarships are racist.  
Why do people think I'm creepy when pressuring women into having sex with me.  
Why is it ok to hit men?
Men should be able to lust after young women.  
Smokers get breaks?  That's not fair!  
I get discriminated against because I'm a man.

Male Genital Mutilation doesn't get enough press

&gt;...they are profiteering businessmen who have never coded in their lives, and dont give two shits about memes. They just want money, period.

These people are TRYING TO MAKE MONEY! By running a website! How can you support this!?

&gt;they slip viruses and malware into their site sometimes

Well today

&gt;I know this will be unpopular

Oh man, silly!

&gt;I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING IN THE ARMY. THEY SIGNED UP FOR IT

Now let's see

It's been said before that redditors must hate anything their Facebook friends like, pretty much any meme that's crossed into the mainstream). Well, the military's no different. Most people would agree that, even though they are getting paid and they signed up for it, military members do still sacrifice a great deal and put their asses on the line for us and thusly are deserving of our respect. If these redditors posted the same anti-military rant to Facebook, they know they would be chastised by most of their friends, so instead they come here where like-minded individuals can discuss how oppressed their opinions are. To the comments!

In the top comment, followed by another user who reminds us that being in the military really *isn't that hard*.

&gt;[But we're expected to act extremely sympathetic towards them. If you're working at pizza hut and say ""damn this job sucks. I hate making pizzas"" then people would look at you and say ""well then get a new job"" or ""yeah working sucks"". But with the military its all ""You're our heroes! Thank you! I can't believe you are drug into this world!"" We're expected to act as if the job they do isn't just a job

You heard the man, I should do a Confession Bear meme, cause I've got an unpopular opinion: this guy probably works at Pizza Hut, or a similar low-income job, because that seems to be the group that complains the most about this issue. ""Hhmph, why does *he* get all the credit just cause he's in the military. My job's hard too y'know!"" Actually, never mind

&gt;[What about the garbage collectors, or any of the other professions more dangerous than the military? They make comfortable, civilized life possible for us; why are they not afforded the same god-like status?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/156utp/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/c7jw6c7)

~~First off

Furthermore, it's because his job is fucking dangerous. As for the respect factor, I don't know, I can't imagine why people have high degrees of respect for people whose job it is to get shot at by terrorists either. Really, I'm stumped. 

The thread's a real winner

&gt;I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR WOMEN WHO MARRY MILITARY MEN AND COMPLAIN HE IS NEVER THERE. THEY AGREED TO IT

That's right boys and girls, if you didn't wanna miss him so much, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP BEING SO IN LOVE WITH HIM.

The top comment points out how arrogant and insensitive it is to criticize people for missing their families. A commenter points out that he encounters these annoying military families trying to get military discounts at restaurants. After some jerking

&gt;[Why give military people a discount at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/157kx9/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/c7k1mas)

Followed closely by:

&gt;[I agree. By that logic

More ""being in the military isn't that hard"" jerking! Of course!

As many people in both threads pointed out, it's interesting that I've never seen someone say ""WELL WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT, YOU DON'T *HAVE* TO BE IN COLLEGE Y'KNOW!"" But it's nice to see that a brave soul finally brought this issue to light. If I had to see another Facebook friend talking about the respect they had for military families, particularly during arguably the toughest time of the year for them, the holiday season, I was gonna vomit.

Happy Holidays

For the uninitiated among you (the sad overwhelming masses who are not lucky &amp; brave enough to be INTPs)

**Intelligence:** We INTPs can all agree that we are of [above average intelligence](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/). Why? Because [overthinking things is a sign of intelligence](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4qg4j1)! 

Unfortunately, whereas ForeverJames's 'study habits and work ethic is [sic] atrocious', he's met only a handful of people who can meet his 'ability to process information'; oh, and by the way? [homeboy has an IQ of 145](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4oycs3). Go INTPs!

Another problem with southernlights' post is that he admits to *feeling*. colorblindboy and dexxter67 are [quick to remind us](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4oxjj7) that INTPs don't have *feelings*; that's the stuff of artists and theists. Rather

**Exclusivity:** Which brings me to another important cornerstone of the INTP fortress. As dexxter67 reminded us above, to his credit, can proudly proclaim that '[personally I never write that I feel, because I don't, I think](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4p9gz9)'. 

Why does the INTP community have to guard so preciously its gates? Because [we are literally the fucking bee's knees](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/uhda1/dea_else_secretly_or_not_so_secretly_think_they/). 

But, 3.1.31). With great power comes great responsibility. intplams wonders whether '[the INTP mind \[is\] created as a result of some kind of early trauma](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/uero5/is_the_intp_mind_created_as_a_result_of_some_kind/)', because he has been 'reading lots of old eastern philosophy and it seems they equate intelligence with pain'. Lots of INTPs also have [messed up sleep patterns](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/uhcmu/dae_have_ridiculously_messed_up_sleeping_patterns/), because we just think too goddamn much!

**INTP feeemales:** It can be concluded that, INTP females are deserving of especial reverence.  wombat_jones demonstrates: 'Holy crap, you're the .001 percent of the .001 percent. And here I felt isolated being an INTP guy. Good luck on your search!' That's right, female INTPs!  You are the .001% of the .001% (or the 10^-8 %--or [1-3% of the population](http://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/estimated-frequencies.htm)).

As a follow-up, as we all know, is halfway to being a man)! But there's trouble brewing in the INTPladynest: INTP female meh_reddit (I know, right!) takes umbrage with the suggestion that INTPs might be disturbing females' biologically determined societal roles; like a true INTPsister, she lays down the law with [some biotruths](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/t53cm/i_am_a_female_intp_ama/c4jnxeg).

Here are a couple of my own questions and thoughts.

- It seems like threads like these tend to signal the beginning of the end, we are seeing people look for the reason. The degradation of quality is a great example. I think that Reddit will eventually lose the majority of the traffic that just quickly hits the defaults and leaves. They will be bored of the same tired joke and the complete lack of humor in /r/funny or the same facebook pwnage in /r/atheism.

However, and all bad things in the world. We all know that on this day 99% of all American redditors celebrate by torturing people, being fat, shooting dogs, and being blissfully unaware of how much better LITERALLY EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS than our country.

So to make sure everyone is educated about that fact some poor brave redditor who I'm sure thought

Now the USA has made mistakes

&gt;And it works. Look at all the threads on Snowden recently. Any criticism of the US / NSA / Spying policies has been met with floods of Americans rushing in to tell everyone that the rest of the world has done some bad shit historically and that, it's likely that everyone else is doing the same or worse than them.

Yes there's certainly no pro-Snowden on reddit.

&gt;And do you think they give a fuck? Nope. They welcome all the crazies they can create that way they can continue to fight the war against the shit they create. The real war is against us. We're the target

The CIA did this so they could fight U.S. citizens!!!!!

&gt;I am this close to becoming a terrorist and I'm from the US!!

We are literally living in the Soviet Union..... and only RON PAUL can help.

You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes. And bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education. Your media would appear free

With some bonus fuck those richies sentiment.

&gt;No sir

&gt;&gt;No they aren't.

&gt;Just for all the Americans reading this, but instead as a bully, with an insatiable desire to control, and profit, from all that lay below it (ie, the rest of the world).

&gt;At first glance, 'duty,' to hand out 'freedom,' and 'democracy,' to all, but it's when countries choose to have the wrong sort of freedom, and America decides to dish out a second serve of justice and stability, and wealth

&gt;I know that your government could, or almost any other citizen of my country disappear within a day, or two at most, but that really isn't too special, there are, after all, quite a number of countries that could do the same. What scares me is that you government could then 'decide, or threats are made on a case to case basis is both up for debate

http://www.pewresearch.org/experts/alan-murray/[1]
Alan Murray has been president of the Pew Research Center in Washington, where he most recently served as Deputy Managing Editor and Executive Editor, Online. Murray spent a decade as the Journal’s Washington Bureau Chief, during which the bureau won three Pulitzer Prizes; and he subsequently served as CNBC’s Washington Bureau Chief, co-hosting “Capital Report with Alan Murray and Gloria Borger.” At various times, he wrote the Journal’s weekly Business and Political Capital columns, and won numerous awards for his writing on economics and international issues.

NOTE: He asks about **4chan

Top comment:

&gt;The majority of people on reddit visit 4chan, some is people trying to pretend they don't really visit 4chan.

Makes sense. Stuff you see on the front page of certain subreddits come straight out of 4chan.

Here comes the Hivemind:

&gt;I don't have the patience to sift through 4chan. I rely on reddit to do it for me.

""Luckily that's only a picture. I'm too scared to go there myself"". This is what's wrong with reddit. Just click and move on.

&gt;4chan is like Skeleton Jelly and Reddit has evolved to almost chimpanzee status. Why go screaming around like a zombie when you can have a banana and smile.

So what he's saying is that reddit is more civilised and evolved than 4chan? The rest of the replies to top comment bring more reddit &gt; 4chan circlejerking.

""I probably looked deep into old /r/atheism history to see what parts I can cherry pick.""

But It goes a little worse than that. Without keeping in mind any account of historical context, are ever so brilliant OP just goes right off the bat at the first few sentences he reads.

&gt;God creates man AND woman out of the dust of the Earth. Then on the next page

Oh my God...I think that this guy just taught me that the bible is full of shit! Its says God created man and woman...and then it says that God then created man first, you know, stating that God created man and woman but he created man first then Woman.

&gt;God says ""Let US make humankind in OUR image, but that isn't used anywhere else

Taking things literally makes a lot of things easier to refute. By this logic and reading comprehension

&gt;God tells the humans to ""be fruitful and multiply"". And then there's the Song of Songs

""All Christians are against having sex and orgasms even though a lot of them have children. Christians are against everything that I find fun

&gt;(Noah) took one each of all the ""clean animals"" and sacrificed them to God by burning them. Dafuq? You just saved them!

I mean

&gt;Lot.. Jeez.. He lived in a cave with his daughters, so as to became [*sic*] pregnant. Nice.

The bible clearly states that what the girls did was a horrible sin

&gt;I didn't even read much yet

Need I say more. ""I just casually went to the dark parts by *complete coincidence*.""

""Yeah srs bro

&gt;You know the true way to break addiction is to actively moderate it. A progressive approach to things like addiction can saves lives and enrich them.

Yep! Functioning alcoholism is great and totally OK! Shit it actually SAVES LIVES! Doesn't matter if you're dependent on a substance. Doesn't matter if you're harming those around you. So long as you're not going too far overboard you're fine!

&gt;I found with some of my family members that struggled with alcohol and other addictions that they can even substitute their addiction with religion and AA ( not saying that's the case for everyone) and then become sober alcoholics; maintaining the same disposition and compulsion as try had before.

Ok this is where I started getting really, once you become an alcoholic there is no turning back. Honestly guys this is exactly why the first step in most 12 step programs is to admit to yourself that you are an alcoholic. This means that you have to realize that you will never be able to drink again. I've seen so many people in my life return to alcohol because they listen to idiots like this. It doesn't matter if you smoke instead of drink, you are still an alcoholic.

&gt;I agree 200%! I stopped drinking as much and started smoking more. Not only did I save money but I lost a ton of weight. I have been to AA but they are all about abstinence and fuck that. So I want to ""self medicate""
I remember going to my mothers house and her saying ""Are you high? OMG etc

Ok? This guy's lack of self awareness is awe inspiring, I'm totally fine! Seriously guys! Totally fine!

It goes on like this for a while, this goes way beyond a minor college drinking. He needs help, not weed, real professional help. It's idiots like these that keep people from finding the help they need. Weed is not the fucking cure to everything, if it was people wouldn't fall off the wagon half as often as they do.

Alcoholism stole a great deal of my childhood, and I mean mad, when I see ignorant comments like these. Most of these neckbeards don't understand just how serious drinking problems like these are.

Most people entering specific subreddits that cater to political ideologies will come in having made up their minds

So when you're confronted with the opposition

The Anarcho-Capitalist subreddit finds itself in just such a conundrum. Much like the /r/politics questions asking people ""How do conservatives possibly accept the things they accept?"" this community asks itself a question:

***Why is there so much resent towards objectivism?***

Now

There is no one

First

&gt;First off, and am sick and tired of people bringing up ayn rand.

Alright...alright...you're prefacing it with why people that are of the same ideology as you disagree with objectivism...not exactly the question

&gt;To answer the actual question, and people believe him.

Suddenly the oversimplifications and strawmen arguments emerge. 

Is it not possible that there is a lot of information to dig through? Could it be that certain studies suggest some things and other studies suggest opposing things and that we are faced with a pretty daunting task when trying to decipher truth from fiction?

Is it possible that people are skeptical of politician promises but that they believe that it's the best option?

&gt;Also, not helping people. Then they judge these rich people based off of their supposed intentions, not the fact that they invented many things you cant live without, and could have invented everything the government invented.

Now, there are people who do good for others out of the goodness of their hearts but we wouldn't balk at defending the profit motive. We posit that even purely selfish gains can only survive in the free market if they benefit others.

The rest of this person's comment is devoted to saying that people are faced with propaganda from a young age and that that is why they believe the things they believe.

But I want to get to the *really* meaty circlejerk.

And it comes to us in the [second highest rated comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16vuh3/why_is_there_so_much_resent_towards_objectivism/c7zu9bt)

&gt;I think the kneejerk reaction of complete hatred for libertarians comes from the fact that we can usually win debates fairly easily

Really now? You can speak for all libertarians?

Surely there are libertarians that frequently get demolished in arguments.

Surely there are libertarians that can't remember all of the empirical evidence.

Surely there are libertarians that aren't of that predisposition purely for logical reasons.

Everyone hate's us because we out-logic them.

Seriously though

&gt;Every hardcore statist has

You heard it here first folks!

It wasn't just that all of you liberals lost an argument to a single libertarian and felt ashamed. It was that you were *publicly* humiliated by your betters!

&gt;So just like in nature

Your fear of us is purely biological. We are your predator

Fear us.

&gt;It's a gut reaction of hatred. We signal real danger to their ideology. Not just a minor disagreement about interpretation of law

Do you hear that sound? It's the sound of every opposing viewpoint in the world crumbling before our mighty logic!

*Thankfully* some reason comes in and the next reply puts him in his place:

&gt;You can't be serious. Please tell me won't be this circlejerky?

Good...surely people will suddenly recognize just how pathetic they're being.

&gt;Why would you be a libertarian if you didn't think it has superior reasoning?

&gt;Libertarians pose the biggest intellectual threat to liberals; this should hardly be a surprise.

Hell nah

&gt;Libertarians defeat liberals within their own liberal paradigm

It has been stated twice folks! It has to be true!

&gt;Why else would you avoid argument and resort to emotional hogwash if you didn't get ""logic bombed"" in the past?

Oh...could it be that people have legitimate reasons to believe what they believe?

Could it be that anarcho-capitalism can sound utopian and crazy?

Nope

There are many fantastic insights into why the rest of the world hates us because of our superior brains but I want to leave you with [this conversation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16vuh3/why_is_there_so_much_resent_towards_objectivism/c7zw0ph)

The [fourth highest rated post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16vuh3/why_is_there_so_much_resent_towards_objectivism/c7zvi86) informs everyone that

&gt;Their friends with government jobs will be ruined. They'll feel intense guilt for supporting a failed system. Their friends with jobs in state-regulated industries will likely be ruined. Their assets may become devalued. They'll be poorly-adapted to the new culture.

The poor, foolish liberals.

Desperately clinging to their ideology because otherwise their lives will have been wasted.

&gt;This is why they're hostile. I don't blame them. They have so much to lose. I don't find it mysterious at all. The struggle for public opinion has the highest stakes. They know that if we win

Over the past 6 months or so I've watched as the quality of /r/Libertarian deteriorated after every big national story led to more nutjobs and conspiracy theorists flooding the sub with insane posts. It started with the ""Dorner good, I decided to see what was going on in there and was met with this beauty of post sitting right on the front page:

[Why do we as a people regard police in such high esteem. When in fact they are agents of the opressive govrernment and enemies of liberty.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1k9qkq/why_do_we_as_a_people_regard_police_in_such_high/)

Oh boy. Let's get started.

Sitting right at the top at 41|8 this post:

&gt;Indoctrination. We are told from our earliest years that police are the good guys that we should trust them and they protect us from all manner of horrible things. Unfortunately

Because the police are *definitely* the bad guys. In every situation. Anyone who believes that police can do good things is delusional. The good guys are really the murderers, drug dealers, extortionists, kidnappers. You know, all those people who take advantage and violate the rights of others.

Here's the top reply to this:

&gt;My dad told me that when he was a boy he wanted to be a policeman when he was older

&gt;That's some mighty fine indoctrination by the state...

Because nobody ever wants to actually serve. It's all just a ploy by the state to increase their ranks of jack-booted thugs. That comment tree then goes into a conversation on why firefighters are evil agents of the state as well. Firefighters.

Further down we see a pseudo-intellectual take on the police which I will break down the the important points:

&gt;I spoke to my friends at a cabin this past week and the conversation started with me saying police are useless (outside taking notes).

&gt;I said ""no, file a report, and tell you nothing will most likely be done."" They just couldn't fathom this idea that the cop, effectively, still did nothing. They couldn't fathom the idea that, at this point, I need a court system

&gt;They couldn't fathom this idea that if they were actively raped

&gt;It ended with one person saying that if I thought cops were useless

&gt;I guess that analogy was in regards to them thinking a burglar actively in my house wouldn't be stopped by an officer if I called them (again, would be as fire tend to respond fast and not hurt citizens).

Police officers *never* figure out who robs houses, the first thing they do is hurt everyone in the general area. Right...

Someone attempts to talk some sense in response to this post and is downvoted. 8|15:

&gt;So you, collect the necessary evidence, and bring them to the court by yourself? Very bold. 

To which the response is:

&gt;Private detective. Private courts.

lol

As we get towards the bottom things are getting braver.

&gt;Same thing with the military. They're just mercenaries.

Hired guns meant to oppress you! 

Let's jump to the posts that attempt to go against the hivemind.

&gt;Because police are necessary to maintain law and order. Yes, and the levels of crime that would result.

Level headed thoughts on why the police are necessary in a functioning society? 14|14. 

&gt;Are you guys serious? Police are the puppets of the elite? You guys need to stop this right now. Yes

11|9. 

&gt;Yes it does! People throw out the entire country police force just because of the actions of a few. I have gotten speeding tickets before and interacted with cops on numerous occasions and I have never been beaten or yelled at or anything unethical. Some were actually nice. For example

2|5.

&gt;I'm shocked that this kind of ignorance is being spouted in a Libertarian forum as well. There are bad cops who don't know how to do their jobs, they will give you directions, they will help you file missing person's reports, and they'll swing by your house to check for intruders if crimes have happened in your neighborhood. They protect the peace. All of this police-bashing needs to stop.

5|7. And here's part of the brilliant response with one important point highlighted:

&gt;

    There are bad cops who don't know how to do their jobs

&gt;There are criminal cops, there is no 3rd type...

    (like drunk driving)

&gt;**Drunk Driving should not be a crime**

    They will also pull up behind you at night when your car breaks down so no one accidentally hits you

&gt;today most cops will NOT stop for motorist in distress

I'm going to skip over the part where he says that there are *le*terally zero moral upstanding police officers and jump right to this point: **Drunk driving should not be a crime.** Seriously? An incredibly selfish decision that directly puts the lives of others at risk should *not* be illegal? Look

This last post I will include has everything. Cop hatred

&gt;What we? I despise police officers

&gt;I've never been mistreated by police officers here in Sweden - they are always polite and friendly to me but I despise them anyway for what they are

&gt;...

&gt;I just want to clairfy that I do mean all police officers. They are evil people worthy of contempt. It doesn't matter that police offficers provide a necessary service when that service is bundled with horrific crimes against humanity. It doesn't matter that the service is currently not bundled where you live

Anyone who has ever been on Reddit can predict what the comments will be like. But these are really bad.

For one thing, and to keep the competition from having the technology. So the first thing to do is NOT assume that this patent means Sony will use the technology. Assuming anything would make an ass out of you and me, and neither of us want that. 

So what does Reddit do? Assume Sony will use the technology, where the true anti-Sony circlejerk shines.

&gt;So if my Sony console breaks I have to buy all the games again because the disk is married to the console. This sound like a poor idea.

Top comment. I consider this to be a truly insultingly stupid thing to say, tying the games to the hardware is unlikely; they'll be tied to a user-ID, or account, or something like that. The article literally says, ""As described in the patent, this ""unique information"" could be a system identifier or some sort of unique user ID that is somewhat portable between systems."" As ambiguous as that is, what is *doesn't* say is ""the disk is married to the console.""

But yeah, all the time, in every way possible?

But what is REALLY funny is the first

&gt;It sounds like Sony just wants us all to get on steam and stop wasting our money. That seems to be their goal.

Wow. So a patent for a hypothetical technology whose only purpose is to disallow reselling of games is SO FUCKING AWFUL that it'll force all of us hardcore gamers to STEAM! Because if there's one thing Steam doesn't allow, no, that makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. Steam rocks! Gaben is so fat! HL3?

The good news is

&gt;As bad as it sounds, re-sell value is a way to make an $50-$65 game cheaper (and you don't even get to keep the game after ""making it cheaper"") because lets be honest, you're not gonna be getting much for the games you find in the bargain bins. Quick Edit: If I couldn't get games at super low prices, I'd still be pirating. Or doing something productive.

1. ""No video game is worth more than one week's allowance. Duh. Who do these people think they are

2. ""But fuck bargain bin games. I deserve only the best. So if I can't get the best games possible at the lowest conceivable price

Okay

One person mentions that the games aren't going to be tied to a console

&gt;So my gf can't play my game on her profile. Still a poor idea.

First, there's simply no pleasing these people. If you were to invent physical distribution of video games on discs today, these guys would be like ""Wait, so I have to literally drive my car to a store, and pay full price, plus tax, and they don't even reimburse me for gas? And if I scratch the disc, I have to buy a second disc? FUCK THE CORPORATIONS! DAE AMERIKKKANT?""

&gt;I bought Warhammer Space Marine and it was so awesome but I couldn't let my friends play because it was on hard and they would die every 5 seconds. Make a new game on normal for them? Nope. Fucking 1 save bulllshit.

Totally irrelevant comment that has nothing to do whatsoever with Sony's new patent technology. 

&gt;This. Why can't it be tied to an account at least.
Fuck you

""Why can't it be tied to an account at least."" Why can't you read the article at least? Or do you just look for the most popular

&gt;Not only if the console breaks but think about the future! I still play games from the ps1 and dreamcast. What if lets say in the future Sony creates the ps5 and there are no new copies for the games I want to play on the ps4. Then I'm forever fucked and can't play all the games that I missed on the ps4!

More hypothetical complaining

-

Once you get away from the uppermost comment threads

&gt;No one is addressing the core issue here. When you buy something, a car, a coat or cash. Digital oligarchs like Sony want to turn the world back to where they own everything and you own nothing. It's the economic model for feudalism or pure slavery. The only solution is to stop buying their products if you can have an alternative. Stop. Do not support their business.

Okay, this is frankly not true. At least not the first few lines. Intellectual content has never been a product that you purchased and ""owned."" People think that stuff like books and N64 games are purchased, ownable products, just because they're physical objects, but they are merely licenses to consume the content they contain. Yes, even a book is just a license. The fact that this content is housed in a physical object is accidental to the content, a byproduct of the limited distribution methods of the 20th century

""Digital oligarchs want to turn the world back to... feudalism or pure slavery."" Really? *Really?* Sony patenting a technology that cuts out middlemen is LITERALLY the same thing as making you, I don't know, REAL ""pure"" slavery?

&gt;This. It disgusts me that certain companies (in this case sony) want to tell me what I can and can't do with something I paid for in full. They no longer own my copy of the game, I get they don't want me to rip the game and sell a million copies for $5 each, and it makes sense. But when the only competition they have for any given game series is used games, and they want to shut it down... It's just despicable.

There's nothing really to say to this stuff. It's so entitled, I can only assume its written by someone with zero experience in the real world. 

&gt;I remember back then the argument used for software was that you did not actually bought it

Yes, more of a fact of life. That people choose to disregard it says nothing about that fact, but speaks volumes about the people disregarding it.

Some more random comments...

&gt;Sony.Never.Learns.

So.Brave.

&gt;I'm glad they are going out of business. Credit rating - Junk like their overpriced DRM bullshit.

""I'm glad!"" Why? How will your life be improved by Sony disappearing? Are your emotions that tied up in this bullshit?

&gt;Really? Are the execs seriously THAT out of touch with reality?
I mean it's like the opposite day. It seems like they're brainstorming on how to completely destroy their business instead of coming up with ways to make money.
Or are they sick of the whole PlayStation thing and just want to bury it? I don't get it...I don't get it at all.

Blah blah, #Occupy, I'm-smarter-than-paid-professionals...

&gt;The more drm I see

HEEYOOOO!

&gt;And why is anyone still giving their money to Sony - they have consistently proved they don't deserve it.

&gt;Looks like I'll never have a reason to ever buy a Sony console ever again.

&gt;This is why people pirate. Now they will have even a greater incentive to hack their new console.

&gt;One more reason to hate Sony. Way to go.

As if you needed a ""reason.""

-

Some of you may think I'm being totally unfair about all this. I'm not saying I love the idea of companies making it impossible to resell my old games, pirate or die), is just stupid. 

I'll say it again: I don't love this new technology, but I'm totally speculating here). I just can't stand watching these guys jerk themselves silly over this situation, relying on mostly false or badly misinformed premises to do so. 

Comments are supposed to, this is a case where the comments actually took AWAY from the article, operating on assumptions that the article itself would have helped dispel. This is pitchfork-rally mode, facts be damned. Gut reactions are all that matter here in r/technology!

I still remember a [rather sweet post by a Korean-Japanese redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/u611n/please_rjapan/) who kindly asked r/Japan to stop with the thinly veiled anti-Korean racism.   It is at a 0 now. There are links to questionable statements in that thread but in any case

And one extra jab at the [Jpop Kpop rivalry too](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y3ixf/this_dokdotakeshima_hate_needs_to_stop/c5s8abe) for good measure.
 
I just don't understand how a random expat is educated and invested enough in Korea's postcolonial bitterness and Japan's post-imperialist snobbery to end up spouting off anti-Korean remarks in his own right.

&gt;If I recall correctly

This is the top comment. I absolutely despise Reddit's predisposition towards eugenics, given the prevalence of the pro-eugenics elsewhere on the site, but I guess that isn't really fair of me. This comment is one of the better ones in the whole post, and I'll let it go.

&gt;He is also devising proof of God using math.

I find the idea of a modern mathematical proof interesting

&gt;I mean

That was the direct response to the bit about proving God, the antithesis to being smart. ""So he can take a stupid test? Doesn't mean he's smart, like *me.* *I* know there is no such thing as stupid God. He's not, you know, an *intellectual.*""

Someone takes a crack at understanding his abstract for his ""mathematical proof for God

Someone else

&gt;His logic seems to be a complicated form of circular reasoning that describes the means for describing the universe within his description of the universe.

How much do you want to bet that this commenter spent less than 20 seconds analyzing the argument (secondhand of course from another comment, *every* system is ""circular,"" as in, self-contained and ultimately self-referential. But that's a philosophical position that isn't worth getting into here...

""How does that prove God's existence

&gt;It doesn't. I think this is an example of what happens when a highly intelligent person isn't properly educated and left to his own devices to come up with a theory of everything and too egotistical to admit when he's wrong.

Lol

&gt;Oh my god

Literally a retard. This is where the comments go from mildly-jerkish to outright rude

&gt;That doesn't add up.

DAE ~~ELON MUSK~~ IRON MAN!?

Okay

&gt;I'd say there's a huge difference between doing well on a test and being an actual genius.
He could very well lack the natural intuition that many geniuses throughout history have had.
So no I wouldn't call him the smartest man in America simply because he has a high IQ.

What can I say to that that it doesn't say of itself?

&gt;He did an Iama and I imagined him to be a friendly guy now that I read this he seems like he's kind of a dick.

""I had an opinion based on what the guy actually said

&gt;Did you also learn that the I.Q. test is horrendously outdated?

There is a strong case to be made about the merits of the IQ test, *unintelligent* thing to do. Whether the IQ test is good or not, it's the easiest, most quantifiable standard we have, so it's what we use. 

The fourth or fifth comment is

&gt;He didn't ""choose his own path."" I've read a bit about this guy and he was too egotistical to make it through college successfully. He didn't get any kind of structured education

Smugsmugsmugsmugsmugsmugsmug

The third top comment does a good job summing up what this thread is all about.

&gt;ITT we all try to sound smarter than this guy.

It's totally okay to find Langan's personal theories strange, or anything personal. But Reddit gets so fucking defensive over it, that they have to hate him, knock him down, and call him an idiot, *just because* he has a high IQ and isn't Einstein or something. 

One impression I got about Langan is that he doesn't believe in the modern education system - it is too bureaucratic or something. Although I don't mind the modern educational system, he's opened himself up to the judges, juries, and (if they had their way) executioners of Reddit to disparage him as a ""freak with a gimmick.""

Full disclosure:  I watch soccer.  And when someone looking for cheap karma posted a video of Luis Suárez

Luis Suárez is a Uruguayan player for Liverpool FC
  On /r/soccer, Suárez was also in trouble for allegedly racially abusing Patrice Evra, a black player, so by now, most people knew that it was kind of futile to defend his behavior.

I will say that I'm not a huge fan of his and that his behavior in the video is very difficult to defend

Many of the comments on the video are exactly what I expected

The most upvoted comment was
&gt;As a hockey fan: Why doesn't someone just punch him in the face?

There were a lot of comments comparing the weak sport of soccer to the manly sport of hockey

&gt;If players didn't dive so much

There were a lot of jerks about diving, with some of them appearing to be malicious and others appearing to be typical  mistimed tackles.

&gt;I've never sat through an entire soccer match. My disinterest is more likely due to the rules and officiating than the players. I can respect playing within the rules to your advantage. But in this case it's detrimental to the overall product to me. If Steve Stamkos, get stitched up, and stay in the game.. Then these fuckers should be ashamed of themselves to screaming in agony and getting carted off on a stretcher because someone kicked them in the shin. But the rules dictate that this behavior will give them an advantage. The overall attitude towards that behavior in the sport just kills it for me.

A beautiful post about how weak soccer players are in comparison to hockey players, and that the poster has never actually sat through an entire match, rendering his entire point void.  I've never watched an entire basketball game or a hockey match, so I don't feel as though I am well-informed enough to discuss the way those sports operate, but this genius seems to believe that he understands the most popular sport in the world by watching parts of matches.

He also fails to realize that getting kicked in the shin by a professional soccer player, if a player is kicked, they will stay down for a little bit and eventually, will stand up again.  He might be drawing a free kick for advantage, but typically, players aren't looking to get others carded, since the refs generally do not reward cards for challenges like that.  Many players do end up playing through injuries because there are limited substitutes per match

Relatively recently

&gt;I honestly think that's a good part of why Americans don't like soccer. As a people, and even in hockey, you fight as a result of the game, not part of it.

Ah

&gt;Im not a big soccer guy in fact ive never even heard of this guy. But after seeing this video I now instantly hate him.

A three minute video is clearly enough time to have an informed opinion on one of the best players in his league.

Let's set the stage: [this article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/21/engineers_cold_and_dead_inside/) is posted to r/science. It's a mess of reporting that is somehow actually trying to be serious (or is it, I had to look up ""trick cyclist,"" because apparently it's slang for psychiatrist. What?

Anyway

&gt;The results were clear-cut

and

&gt;They were cold-hearted and uncaring

[On to the reactions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16zmls/new_study_engineers_exhibit_less_emotion_and/). Currently, currently at +200.

&gt;We don't need engineers to be caring

also I'd like to highlight a response
&gt;That's why we put all the incompetent people in sales.

Now full disclosure, this whole notion that ""it's okay to not care about people because I'm an engineer"" is complete and utter bullshit. Now, I understand that there are lots of asocial and antisocial disorders that contribute to certain people's lack of empathy. That is not the problem here, the problem is otherwise normal people perpetuating the idea that it is a-okay to be cold in this profession.

More comments:

Someone tries to fight the jerk:
&gt;Building a slick thing is great

He gets contempt and snark back at him:
&gt;That is why we have management

Huge ego alert:
&gt;I (and most engineers I know) simply have a low tolerance for morons. It's a feature

""I understand you
&gt;They're using the definition of empathy as submissive, not necessarily caring about it.

Edit: People have rightfully pointed out that the above poster has a valid point. I do still disagree with the first sentence of their statement

And something that really struck me:
&gt;I mean I flocked to engineering because it meant less social interaction. I wanted a job where my lack of social aptitude wouldn't hamstring me.

Honestly, team members, subordinates, and inter-department contacts. You'll have to be able to present your ideas/progress/products to higher-ups in an efficient way. You'll have to interact with all these people, and doing so with empathy allows you to have the best workplace experience possible because you attempt to understand your peers and care about them. Would these engineers who advocate this anti-empathy sentiment want their peers not to care about them? I wonder.

Something to keep in mind for context - drugs are illegal. Really illegal. Which means the type of people who discuss, at worst, outright conspiracy theorists and general nutjobs. So sadly, it's not uncommon to see incredibly obnoxious lines of thought such as ""weed is impossible to be addicted to"", ""the government keeps psychedelics illegal to prevent the masses from free thinking"", and ""DAE pharmaceutical industry = literally Hitler"". However, this post will demonstrate that even when mass media / ""the guhhmint"" / ""like, Druggit users will trip over themselves to circlejerk about how enlightened and out of the SYSTEM they are and how the masses are easily misled sheeple.

Now, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, has notably reversed his professional opinion on the medical applications of marjiuana. He / CNN released a 44 minute TV special about how the conventional wisdom of marijuana is incorrect and, while not risk free, it can be of great help to many.

Also in that comment thread
&gt;Call me crazy but Gupta reverses his stance and this special comes out right as Eric Holder is set to announce crumbs to the peasants.

**WARNING: THIS IS A *LONG* POST!**

Before I get into the meat of this discussion, sadly disintegrated into a horrible rabble of baseless claims, paranoia, conspiracy theories, etc.

This Ars Technica post was recently linked, a lot of the top comments concern why it is bad idea to rely on things like consumer-grade wireless routers for some sort of public safety network. however there is no short supply of delusional speculation and chatter lower down:

http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/yrxn3/no_fing_way_this_is_exactly_what_we_dont_want/c5yb2el

&gt;Well of course they are thinking about it. Do you really think they aren't paying attention to all of this DarkNet and MeshNet ""chatter""? This is just the sort of thing they fund the NSA for.

Oh give me a bloody break! Do these people really think the NSA doesn't have anything better to do?

Apparently the answer is yes:

http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/yrxn3/no_fing_way_this_is_exactly_what_we_dont_want/c5yhwwc

&gt;Dear NSA.
&gt;I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change

&gt;Oh the ending (in the US) is easy to predict.
&gt;
&gt;IF (and it's a big if) people ever get their shit together and build a large decentralized network that ""they"" (the govt.) have no control over ""they"" won't stand for it.
&gt;
&gt;It will be labeled a ""threat to national security"" and those that provide it and use it will essentially be labeled ""criminals"". (They will use the usual arguments; terrorism, and probably the militia and anarchist etc. movements as the reason. The first time they can link a violent act to the DarkNet (even if it's not true, it won't matter) the shit will really hit the fan.
&gt;The Dept. of Homeland security will get a bunch more funding and will begin triangulating wireless access points (possibly using drones

&gt;The internet is already severely compromised and falling apart at the seams. Single organizations have shown the ability to block domains, I don't see the cattle being affected for the next decade or so. There's no profit in provoking an uprising, but if we don't have an alternative up, running, and ready in that timespan, we'll slide down a gradual slope away from privacy, and away from the people owning any part of our infrastructure.

And here's the only comment calling out the other idiots: http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/y27lv/serious_discussion_how_do_you_stop_the_darknet/c5shv2i

I have always loved this Encyclopedia Dramatica article

In their psychotic fantasies, as evinced by the downvoting of anyone who hints at self-awareness.

Now, since the original post already describes a lot of the problems with the circlejerk in /r/darknetplan, I figure I'd just reuse it here. 

  
&gt;  It seems to me that lately, and some sort of bizarre cyberpunk-wannabe breed of neckbeard. I know these are inflammatory words, but I am not trolling (the idea that ""trolling"" is expressing contrary opinions has become prevalent, it's not. trolling is engaging in antisocial behaviour for the purpose of instigating conflict and derailing discussions.) and I intend on qualifying these statements.
&gt;
&gt;    Let me say that first, if not at the very least just for fun! I myself have several major complaints with the internet as it stands:
&gt;
&gt;* ICANN's stranglehold on the DNS. If .xxx wasn't already enough, it almost literally reads like, ""Nice trademark you got there, it'd be a shame if not registering it under a TLD you will literally never use to pre-empt domain squatters would be used as evidence of abandonment...""
&gt;
&gt;* The intrinsic insecurity of the internet
&gt;
&gt;* Outrageous abuses of local monopolies by ISPs. Filtering traffic, port blocking, instead of, you know, investing money back into the network.
&gt;
&gt;There are of course many more shortcomings I could list. However, baseless speculation. Specifically, it seems to be a common belief that the US government is explicitly preparing some sort of mechanism to censor the internet en masse. There is a quote I like by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, that I believe to be pertinent to this issue, ""Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him."" SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, etc were/are all stupid, and others into some nebulous concept, or whatver
&gt;
&gt;    The thing is, ""When we get the remote Russian village online, what will get people to the Internet is not going to be reports from Human Rights Watch. It’s going to be pornography, ‘Sex and the City,’ or maybe funny videos of cats.” But the biggest problem is that this mythologized struggle against the internet, as some sort token of democracy, is fundamentally misguided if not delusional. For starters, people somehow think a dictator can't access it, what is more suspicious? Blocking the internet
&gt;
&gt;    Well

EDIT: One last thing that should be brought up is that most people on Reddit who invoke free speech or the first amendment don't know how it works. At least in the US, the point is, when redditors get in a huff over American shows being prudish and not showing breasts, or whatever, the government makes no claim of protecting such things.

&gt;As an engineer myself I can say that this is mostly due to lack of personal identity. Engineering IS hard but some people need to constantly remind their surrounding of that since that's really all they got.

**BOOM!** Right off the bat we have this comment basically giving the notion that its ok for engineering majors to be assholes because they need to be.

The first child comment is kinda understandable if you remove the connotation that only engineering majors can get upset when people brag about their higher grades to you. 

&gt;And bitterness about others generally having more free time, working and getting 65% the whole time... you get frustrated.

During my brief time in college i've had friends brag about their 80% and 90% to me while i'm in the midst of venting about my terrible grades and it really is annoying

The next comment is just an irrelevant ""le relevant username amirite?"" comment (because the poster above has Civil Engineering in their name) but it proceeds to set off a chain reaction of ""DAE Civil Engineering is literally non-STEM?"" and a huge dick measuring contest of who has the harder engineering major/degree.

On to the next top level comment: 

&gt;At most places

&gt;1. It attracts people with generally low social skills. Everyone here has a mental problem
&gt;2. It sucks. Its not fun. Its really hard. Its worth it! Its so worth it!!! but it sucks for 4-5 years and its hard to see the communications majors slide through college and then walk across the stage and receive the same piece of paper as you. It takes a lot of convincing to remember that it is worth sticking it out in engineering. often that means putting down the degrees around you. Whether or not they deserve it.

&gt;tl;dr It doesn't excuse the behavior but these are poorly adjusted people under incredibly high stress

Now this is a beast of a comment to tackle

A lot of STEM majors attract people with low social skills because they're painted as these secluded positions where you're only forced to interact with the unwashed masses a few times and are generally left to themselves to be smug and crunch numbers and do whatever it is they do when left alone (Which is highly untrue, and just as many who actually have some sort of mental problems (like depression). it could be anecdotal evidence speaking but i doubt there's some huge correlation of mental illness and engineering majors, and in fact i've seen way more people with mental health issues in the IT field because of how secluded and private a huge percentage of jobs can be.

And the second point is where it just becomes a huge ""no, change your major, take a semester off to find yourself, or just play the field and maybe even * gasp * take a non-STEM elective! you're not forced to stick to something you hate just to end up hating it even more and causing yourself problems down the line.

The rest of that comment thread turns into just stories of ""well this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy knew this guy that killed himself because he couldn't handle the stress of engineering"" which goes back to the point i just made.

Has to be a fluke

&gt;It buys them publicity on sites like this for a game that probably wouldn't have got any notice

&gt;I think of it like this: If a game is good
If a game is shit, and it won't sell a lot.
If you go bankrupt because of that, people will tell you what's shit about it. If you still blame piracy after that without listening to any of the hopefully valid criticism, maybe you shouldn't make games.
For me personally, but at least you get to play them)). If I like the game, I'll buy it, if I don't, I won't.
Watching and reading reviews is fine
The only downside here is that shitty games that are just jumping on the bandwagon of whatever is in style at the moment don't sell

Further down:

&gt;As a fellow amateur musician

&gt; These neighborhoods are typically really old sections of the city that used to be decent residential but as the town grew and the traffic increased the homes dropped in value and now poor people can afford them and move into them. Wealthy neighborhoods don't have main roads running through them because they were built after the main roads had already been established and were intentionally built away from them.

Occasionally a person will ask whether or not it is ""worth it"" to learn music theory and guitar technique to become a better guitarist. Of course, further convincing each other that they can do just fine without it. I won't post any links to these threads because I usually get personally involved.

Another common thread to post on this subreddit is to ask off-topic questions about playing in a band or discussing playing in bands.

1362208262.0,19ihew,Google Fiber/ISPs part II: The Ultimate Circlejerk,firemylasers,185,39,43,"As some of you may recall

Since then

I've noticed that the jerk has become so bad that anyone who doesn't accept Google as their lord and savior gets downvoted to hell and back. Google Fiber threads are *full* of people spouting bullshit and projections about the service.

My last post was focused on debunking some common claims as well as showing off the jerk. This one is intended to be a bit of an expansion of the last one

I wrote about a third of this before remembering to disable automatic spellchecking

So let's get started!

Wall of text warning: This post is roughly 4000 words long, your call.

###Voting

It's clear that Google is popular in /r/technology. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll see an article about them at least once a week, the actual average amount of upvotes is around 1581. I'd even go as far as saying that this is the biggest circlejerk on the site. Unfortunately, very few people seem to understand anything *about* the whole project. They just get excited at the prospect of 1Gbps without bothering to fact-check or think things through.

Articles bashing other ISPs also see a disproportionate amount of upvotes. The number one link of all time on /r/technology has the title ""Dear Google Fiber: Please, so let's take a quick look inside.

The author starts off by mentioning that he has network issues. Instead of calling his ISP to get them fixed, ironically, is $66/mo and has both internet and basic cable, while Google Fiber with TV would be $120/mo plus fees — it seems that he isn't willing to pay for better TV unless it comes from Google). The entire article is nothing more than a poorly written blurb about Google Fiber and the author's personal wishes. And yet, redditors decided that it's worthy of being the number one post of all time on their technology subreddit — voted higher than articles like ""397-0. House approves resolution to keep Internet control out of UN hands."", ""Syria has disconnected from the Internet. All 84 of Syria's IP address blocks have become unreachable, effectively removing the country from the Internet."", you own it

Even as I write this post

###People don't really need 1Gbps

Say that phrase in /r/technology and you've just pissed off a sizable portion of the 2.6 million subscribers. It's like committing internet suicide. For some odd reason

Well, but uselessly overpowered for the task at hand.

If that wasn't clear enough, nobody has found a consumer use for gigabit internet beyond ""lol it's fast"". Of course, reddit finds a way around that argument…

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/19fo5k/you_dont_want_superhighspeed_internetsays_time/c8nmh81

&gt;Time warner is lying through it's teeth

I think most of you can see the issue here. As I've already shown, redditors seem to think that it's essential.

Just for fun, that's only 180Mbps — you don't even need fiber for those speeds! DOCSIS 3.0 Cable systems can support up to 300Mbps with channel bonding, and DOCSIS 3.1 will support even higher. And again, we're looking at 4k — realistically, everyone would be streaming 1080p (roughly 7Mbps bitrate with Netflix's ""SuperHD"" option), so that's only 35Mbps.

And on a related note

You can argue all day about ways to saturate 1Gbps, and how much (LEGAL) torrent traffic does the average person use anyways? Most people are streaming and browsing the web, not downloading Linux ISOs, WoW, and the small amount of software with Torrent downloads as an option.

So really

Of course, someone may or may not have said something about 640k or 64k of RAM being all you'd ever need, way back at some point in the 90s. Nowadays, this (possibly completely made up) quote is used to justify gigabit fiber. But what these people don't seem to understand is that if this was true to the extent they're claiming it's true, you'd have **never** seen **any** innovation in technology. Nada. Zilch. If you actually had to have widespread adoption for a use, nothing would ever be invented. Let's look at electricity. It was useful far before widespread adoption. What about internet? That didn't require widespread adoption to come up with uses for it. And cars? Those were developed when roads were usually gravel paths or dirt, maybe cobblestone if you were lucky. So like all the other ""justifications""

…on the other hand

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/19h044/time_warner_cables_arrogance_perfectly/c8nykef

&gt;I think the fact that people in Kansas City can rent out their houses just on the fact that they have google fiber shows that many people don't just want it

Ah yes

http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/12/google-hacker-house/

So one room being rented out suddenly equals ""people in Kansas City can rent out their homes""? Hah.

###The shady side of Google's deal

Something a lot of people don't realize about Google Fiber is that their deal with Kansas City is shady in many ways. Here's a few quotes from the [Google-KCMO agreement](http://www.netcompetition.org/wp-content/uploads/Google-Kansas-Agreement1.pdf).

&gt;In consultation with City

Oh boy. Now this is a big one. Did you catch that?

&gt;Google will decide where to build

Yeah. They get to choose where to build out the fiber. Now I don't have the Kansas City cable franchise agreement, as this type of agreement is pretty generic.

http://www.ci.carbondale.il.us/sites/default/files/pdf/FranchiseAgreementRevision22006.pdf

&gt;5.3 Operator shall extend service to all residences within an annexed area adjacent to any portion of the City then currently served by Operator in which the density of homes is at least six (6) residences per 1320 cable-bearing feet (one-quarter cable mile) measured from Operator’s existing distribution system (excluding homes subscribing to direct satellite) within twelve (12) months of a request by residents of such area for service. In the event that such annexed area is served by another cable operator or its technically or financially infeasible at the time of such request

Now one city is obviously not proof of anything

http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/downloads/pdf/time_warner_cable_franchise_agreement_brooklyn.pdf

&gt;5.3 Provision of Service: Subject to the exceptions set forth in Subsection 5.4 hereof

Damn! That's a hell of a lot different from Google's agreement! So there you have it — Google gets to deploy wherever they want, TWC is forced into covering the entire city. How again is TWC being ""beaten"" by Google when Google isn't even following the same rules?

But wait! There's more!

&gt;City will make space available to Google in City facilities for the installation of Google’s Central Office (“CO”) equipment and for additional network facilities, and will not charge Google for such space, power or related services.

&gt;Subject to City’s reasonable security measures and escort procedures, maintenance, replacement and repair functions. City will secure City locations via locked doors that trigger alarms in the event of unauthorized entry.

&gt;The parties will determine the timing for delivery of the necessary space for the Google equipment cooperatively as part of the Project planning. Location may be changed at the discretion of City to locations at least as suitable. In the event of such a change

&gt;City will not charge Google for access to City’s assets and infrastructure.

&gt;City will provide Google with access to assets and infrastructure of City, but will not be limited to, conduit, fiber, poles, rack space, nodes, facilities

&gt;City will not impose any charges for access to or use of any City facilities provided under this Agreement

&gt;City will cooperate with Google in efforts to allow Google to gain access to poles and rights-of-way owned or controlled by third parties.

Additional notable obligations under the contract:

&gt;(c) Create a City team dedicated to the Project and allow Google to place Project employees in City office locations

&gt;(e) Provide access to assets and infrastructure

&gt;(h) Use the dedicated City Project team to provide on-the-spot exception management where necessary to avoid delays in the Project.

&gt;(i) Provide a dedicated inspection team as part of the City Project team for inspection of all work performed on the Project. As part of this process

&gt;(j) Allow Google to attach fiber on City poles

&gt;(k) Provide Google with access to detailed GIS data and computer tools, those of third parties, with no charges for such access.

&gt;(l) Provide consulting assistance to Google on planning and build of the Project

&gt;(o) Cooperate with Google on all publicity and public relations for the Project

Holy shit! I don't see those provisions in New York's or Carbondale's franchise agreements! Google gets free &lt;everything&gt; from the government? Google gets to censor the government's words?

What was that argument I keep on hearing?

Hmmm. This doesn't quite look like much of a free market success, and somehow get the obscene city benefits that Google got from Kansas City in all the cities these ISPs serve.

So

I could go into further detail on this

###The 97% myth

Anyone remember [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/17y3d1/cable_companies_make_97_margin_on_internet/)? It's been quoted over and over again. People are convinced that all the big cable companies are raking in the cash.

Now I'm pretty sure that everyone on this subreddit can already see some flaws

We might already know that it's bullshit

Search for the phrase ""cable distribution giants like Time Warner Cable and Comcast are already making a 97 percent margin on their ‘almost comically profitable’ Internet services"" (with quotes) in Google and you'll see an impressive 1200 results. Quite high for a 27 day old article

The source for all this bullshit is MIT's David Talbot. On February 4th he published an article entitled ""When Will the Rest of Us Get Google Fiber?"" [link](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/510176/when-will-the-rest-of-us-get-google-fiber/?utm_campaign=newsletters&amp;utm_source=newsletter-daily-all&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20130205). 

&gt;In parts of the country, and a few fiber networks are already built out. The cable distribution giants like Time Warner Cable and Comcast are already making a 97 percent margin on their “almost comically profitable” Internet services, according to Craig Moffet, an analyst at the Wall Street firm Bernstein Research. As Levin points out, “If you are making that kind of margin, it’s hard to improve it.” And most Americans have no choice but to deal with their local cable company.

Full halt!

&gt;according to Craig Moffet

Hmmm. I wonder where I might find information on this report of his.

http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/15/does-cable-really-have-a-97-profit-margin/

Aha! Talbot is a lying sack of shit who misquoted Moffet so that Talbot's article is nice and controversial. Case closed

###The 140 billion dollar question

Another thing redditors like is the prospect of universal broadband. For some reason, when an article claimed a nationwide rollout would cost $140 billion, redditors jumped on the bandwagon and started blindly citing the figure.

http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-it-would-cost-google-to-build-a-cable-network-2012-12

&gt;Building out the infrastructure will be expensive. In his September 17 report Still Bullish on Cable, it could equip 830K homes per year, or 0.7% of US households. As such, even a 50mn household build out, which would represent less than half of all US homes, could cost as much as $70bn. We note that Jason Armstrong estimates Verizon has spent roughly $15bn to date building out its FiOS fiber network covering an area of approximately 17mn homes. The cost of ongoing test cases like this and the potential for significant cap ex investments also likely contributed to the company’s recent decision to issue non-voting class C shares in an effective stock split, in our view. Moreover, Jason Armstrong also pointed out that Google’s TV offering represents the fifth (or higher) competitor in an already competitive market. All that said

I see no 140 billion figure there. What's more

Now we're looking at averages in Verizon's footprint here, these per-home numbers are averages of Verizon's costs to pass 17m homes with only 5.4m hooked up internet customers. The much higher hookup rates for a national networks would drive costs up even further than $1350 per home.

Still, using the lowest possible per-home cost figures. In reality, per-home costs for 80% of the United States with realistic uptake numbers would probably be at least $1500 per home, meaning that 80% would cost 138 billion dollars. And that other 20%? The average cost per home for rural areas could be anywhere from $3000 to $10000 (ignoring the extremely hard to reach areas since those could cost hundreds of thousands each and would skew the numbers too far up). Even if it's $5000, that's 115 billion dollars right there. These numbers don't scale linearly, you can't lump rural and residential together under the residential rate.

So basically, as usual, without even bothering to fact-check, redditors seized the story and used it to promote their wishful dream of 1Gbps fiber for everybody.

(on a side note, bridges, education, college, debt, financial crisis, etc)

###The international community

Ah yes

..and every single one of these people ignores the government-funded infrastructure projects that paid for the infrastructures used by those other countries, the terrible international speeds (effectively making many of these networks nothing more than a superfast country-wide LAN), the larger population density (gigabit may be $20/mo in Hong Kong, but a 40-square foot apartment is the hidden cost), the late adoption of the internet (it's easy to build out fiber when you don't have existing copper and coax), the smaller country size, and other inconvenient facts.

###The Dark Fiber Myth

What's that? Fiber is expensive to build out? Then why do we have all this dark fiber? I saw a news article a while ago about Google buying it

Nope. Nope nope nope nope. First of all

Case closed.

###Netflix's PR stunt

Way back in November 2012, they included… Wait for it… Google Fiber!

http://blog.netflix.com/2012/12/november-isp-rankings-for-usa.html

It's a blantant PR stunt. Google has very few customers, this thread took off a bit too fast on reddit, spawning a few highly amusing comments.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14o98f/netflix_ranks_google_fiber_as_the_most_constantly/c7exr5v

&gt;I hope they start rolling out Google Fiber in more cities soon. This has the potential to finally restore some genuine competition to the broadband market.

""I hope Porche gives me a free car soon. This has the potential to make luxury car prices lower. Oh and I'll also be paying more taxes. The IRS guy said something about a grant to Porche to bring cheap luxury cars to the American public

&gt;In the US sex is looked like it is the devil. People actually fight against sex ed in schools. It blows my mind that you would not teach a teenager how to use condoms and birth control for sex. There are a lot of double standards here and I am very sick of it.

&gt;Sex is so overhyped in this society

Different people put different emphasis on different things? Not on reddit!

&gt;I think more people ought to think in this way

Possibly

&gt;Only an idiot would tell a teenager ""don't have sex"" and expect it to have any effect.

Of course nothing parents can do will have any effect.

I thought this was a [ballsy submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/z6ve5/poor_simple_ralph_getting_downvoted_xpost_from/)

Original content with the loosest interpretation of the word ""original"" ever applied.  Here's a good example of [[OC]](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/x4i3c/i_animated_a_downvote/).

I saw quite a few more of these inappropriately applied [[OC] labels](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/yys7u/made_a_new_downvote_gif_oc/) as I searched.  Obviously

These reddit-branded gifs seemed to be a recent trend to me... I've only noticed these upvote/downvote gifs overrunning Reddit just within the last month or so.  In my diligent research for this investigative expose

So we've got ~~a~~ subreddit~~s~~ designed to create reaction gifs meant to be posted in comment threads

So far I've only seen downvote gifs used against trolls in bottom-of-page hidden comments.  They are upvoted comparably with the downvotes of the trolling OP.

But it's only a matter of time before they're routinely used to respond to actual comments... and then it's a battle.  Will reddit find the discussion comment worthier than the reply gif immediately below it?

I'm pretty certain these gifs will ultimately facilitate the decline of Reddit comment threads at an exponential rate.

Any of you who believe that comment karma is where it's at... you better start making gifs.

&gt;while cultural relativism is important for context it still does not make shitty things ok. 

There are some people fighting back

&gt;Hitler ruined eugenics for the rest of us.

Holy shit

And here comes another guy lacking any self awareness.

&gt;Why would anyone be against eugenics?

Yeah

Moving on...



&gt;&gt;The year 2100 will see eugenics universally established. In past ages

&gt;Wow. We have to keep in mind though

&gt;I doubt that Tesla understood the scope of the atrocities that were being committed in Europe (and at the hands of the California eugenics movement[1] ) at the time.

&gt;However unpleasant the idea of eugenics is to reasonable people on its surface

In case you missed it.

This comment was so bizarre and of course brought in the ""Europeans are beautiful"" jerk that I had to point it out. Apparently eugenics is bad but thank god the swedish did it so we can admire their faces. 

I've already gotten a lot so I'll just quote some of the more awful ones.

&gt;1. Hitler's implementation of eugenics was radically flawed. It isn't an inherently bad idea.


&gt;2. I like the concept of eugenics and think it should be practiced today.

&gt;3. Honestly if they could make it 100% reversible

&gt;4. The fact remains he is partially correct, and the Behavioral Sink) Imagine how much more threatening jail would be if violent felonies were not only punishable by jail time but by sterilization.

And arguably the worst:

&gt; Every single person in here who is bashing Eugenics is a fucking moron. Sorry

&gt; There IS a genetically ""superior"" pool of individuals out there. This is simply a fact of biology, where they're located, these are all questions we have yet to answer. But the fact remains that there is a quantifiably better set of genes out there, and we could and should promote the spread of those genes in the population while trying our best to cut down on undesirable genes by providing incentives for those who don't reproduce.

&gt;First step is of course identifying what is superior, and then by going through the genome to systematically isolate and promote genes which benefit us in life. Genes which promote muscle growth, genes which are less prone to cancer, genes which increase cognitive function, etc...

&gt;The only thing is

&gt;Everyone bashes Eugenics using the slippery slope argument, but we are alone in our decision to not only sustain the life of those with clearly inferior genes, but also to promote their reproduction.

As a junior in college majoring in elementary education, I can understand where the teacher in this clip is coming from. Escalating the situation in front of your entire class by entering a debate with this student would be counterproductive (again, this is based on what I've learned/experienced), all it leads to is the class falling more off-track and the potential for an even worse situation. I think she made the right call in continually telling him to leave, cut off the confrontation before it escalates. I personally would have told the student I'd love to discuss my methods with him outside of class, but that this wasn't the time or place. In the heat of the moment though, I can still understand why she just went with the safest route.

I wonder what Reddit thinks?

From my understanding it was a light hearted prank which I have absolutely no problem with, chimes in [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/171ct5/iam_dennis_miller_comedian_and_political_talk/c81d1x1) and says he’s not going to do anything, and gives a tongue in cheek remark about capitalism while he’s at it:

&gt;Mod here -- it's a bit of a gray area as to whether non-abusive questions should be deleted, we've deregulated to allow the invisible hand of the market decide.

Redditors in a unique case are understandably annoyed:

&gt;actually what you've done is further establish the precedent that it's o.k. to massively troll someone's ama. 

And eventually after enough backlash he changes his mind, and some decent questions for Miller. Unfortunately, what could have been a cool thread is a let down because of bad moderating.

The second AMA I want to point out is [NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17fylz/iam_roger_goodell_nfl_commissioner_ama/) that was done today. For those who don’t know, redditors ask terrible questions and proceed to pretty much insult the guy.

The subreddit /r/nfl made a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/17g0mb/the_roger_goodell_ama_is_a_fucking_joke_i_wish_it/) that was titled “The Roger Goodell AMA is a fucking joke! I wish it was done in /r/NFL. Then

There are dozens of bad upvoted comments

&gt;I posted this in the other thread and I'll do it here too:

&gt;Some of the top (score of 100 or more) ""questions"":

&gt;you suck

&gt;do your parents know you suck cock?

He ends up answering like a dozen questions overall
What I don’t understand is that it seems like the people who own reddit should care about things like this because it’s a huge marketing opportunity for them and it reflects poorly on the website when things like this happen. But the owners stay true to their hands off style and just let the mods do whatever they please. Maybe I’m missing something but this seems like such a big structural issue on this website- that some nobody with mod privileges can “run” high profile celebrities like this with no control. Just look at /r/atheism and how trashy and bad it is

**Bizarre Political Arguments**

There are a lot of things that redditors jerk about nonstop that I could discuss here, and Westborough Baptist Church, but I’m just going to keep it to something that I know circlebroke is familiar with and that I don’t especially understand the hype about- male circumcision.

This subject and the politics behind it are probably about as important to me as Beyonce lip-syncing at the Inauguration or the fact that some random redditor had a Star Trek themed wedding complete with a life size portal guns and two disappointed parents in the pews. I didn’t even know really what it was somewhere in my mid-teens and I keep spelling it ‘circumsicion’ because I don’t think I’ve ever had to type it out before right now. But for some reason on reddit **it will not go away**.

Like [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/16rsuy/okay_seriously_wtf/), or [here in smaller ones.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/16xqqe/religious_tradition_more_like_penispenispenis/).

You get the picture.

Not to mention these threads are all within the last week

If I talked about circumcision in real life as much as redditors do here, it get that it can be bad and that I don’t want to be on “the wrong side of history”, but in the end who cares? The ratio of how much it affects men to how much it is discussed is way out of proportion, and eventually its going to go away so it doesn’t warrant this much discussion. And it’s harmless until people from Men’s Rights start saying how it’s comparable to female genital mutilation, which seriously fucks up women who undergo the mutilation. It’s almost infuriating.

“Well why don’t you go to /r/conservative or /r/libertarian you stupid fundie?” you might say

The libertarian subreddit mentions 1984 more than anyone who isn’t a conspiracy theorist should ever mention (check out /r/panichistory if you don’t believe me) and the conservative one is devoid of good discussion. The one mod keeps calling liberals “libtards” which isn’t productive and is the kind of offensive stuff I don’t go to /r/politics for. He is even the moderator of a subreddit called /r/libtards

For an example of the lack of content

**Redditors Bullying Kids**

The first two points are pretty much harmless, I cannot escape from people making fun of kids on this website. And some of them are really cruel.

For example

&gt;She has more facial hair than I do [+75]

Nothing cringey about this picture

[This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/17duts/she_looks_really_into_it_bro/) from the same subreddit posts a pictures of a kid with a physical handicap (FAS?) and got over 1000 upvotes of people “cringing” at him.

&gt;That kid lost the genetic lottery HARD [+381]

&gt;The Spartans would have thrown him off a cliff [+130]

&gt;His face looks like the new kill me now face [+102]

In /r/rage people are raging over [some kid](http://www.reddit.com/r/rage/comments/15q1m0/such_a_punchable_face/) who can’t be over 14

&gt;Word of the Day: Backpfeifengesicht (German) Means:A face badly in need of a fist. [+130]

&gt;The longer I stare at this

&gt;I would love to rip that little fucker's tongue right out of his mouth. [+4]

And finally

&gt;The people that do act on those feelings [of shooting up a school] aren't bad people either. They're ignored and allowed to spiral out of control people. [+34]

I was taught morality in a fundie prison (Catholic school), but I think it might apply to this too. I’ve got to draw the line in moral relativity somewhere, and this went way past it.

&gt; You've likely been told you're beautiful, 115 pound waif, you're fat; unless you wear Maybellene, you're ugly; **men will tell you and show you that you are, in fact, attractive. It's been going on so long that it's just annoying now, but it happens.**

You women have been undeservedly crept on and hounded for centuries

&gt; Now

Imagine a world, under the fascist authority of your life-bearer...

&gt;**But, they're absolutely right.** 

So apparently not being called attractive is equivalent to being called unattractive by everyone ever.

&gt;No man truly finds you attractive

Firstly, unwilling to change for his own sake, and devoid of what is required in a relationship. If a somewhat goodlooking woman is depressed, thinks no one cares for her, and thinks she's ugly, god damn it as a Reddit White Knight I must take it upon myself to put this woman on a pedestal, for then she might bestow her fertile vagina upon my neckbeard and become my own OAG.

Let's just look at some more comments in the r/bestof thread

* The top comment is deviated by a girl who is wondering, or because women don't care about your Tshirts. Another user sums it up nicely: [""...giving compliments to men that never receive them could give them the wrong idea.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/c6d6516)
* [""... people measure guys by other factors too. Financial success, etc. What a guy lacks in physical attractiveness, he can definitely make up for with the other factors.

a. Queen/Beatles/Pink Floyd

b. A Joke

c. Someone posting about how reddit's taste in music is soooo great and underground compared to the garbage everyone else listens to!

If you answered **b** you are correct:

&gt;Slob on my Knob - Three 6 Mafia

As if that wasn't enough

Next top level comment is an Explosions in the Sky song. Now I don't know if this is considered a reddit-jerk but the hivemind seems to like Explosions in the Sky a lot. Who can blame them? That's a pretty sweet band. Their love is a bit weird though

&gt;If you like them

My problem with this is two-fold: First, second, this sounds like he ripped it straight from a Pitchfork review.

Farther down we have someone risking his/her life/neckbeard to tell everyone about:

&gt;Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah

I don't know about you guys but I have never ever heard of that song. I'm glad someone posted it! DAE onions?

My favorite comment, The ""Let me Compile Some Good Songs on this Thread to Get Le Max Karma"" comment which includes such gems as the Buckley song, Johnny Cash, Pink Floyd, Leonard Cohen, Bach (I'm convinced no one on reddit actually listens to classical music and they just say it to sound intelligent), and reddit's favorite RADIOHEAD.

The next comment down is basically the same exact list with some additions no one has ever heard of like Arcade Fire and Velvet Underground.

What's interesting to me about this thread is the lack of my favorite karma whoring trick: Le G[ent]leman Link Poster. In almost every music thread there is a commenter who comments to almost every song post with

&gt;link for the lazy

all while racking up insane amounts of karma and ""THANK YOU GOOD SIR I NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OTHERWISE""

I guess what I'm going for here is reddit's strange music culture. On the one hand, a lot of redditors also wanted their music tastes validated. They know if they post an actual [unknown band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQToSTTUBAI) no one will bother to listen to it an upvote it so they pick the next best thing: a band that doesn't get much top 40 play but is still adored by tons of people. In their minds this evens everything out because they will get upvotes and nice comments to pretend that they helped a lot of people discover something new! At the same time, looking through the comments it's clear that almost every song posted is a love song.

This particular askreddit thread never explicitly uses the phrase ""friendzone"", the actual question is even more insulting. ""What have you done for a potential partner that has been a complete waste of time?"" implies that taking someone out is a complete waste of time unless it ends in secks.

Because women aren't worth anything if they don't have sex with you.
&gt;If she's willing to do that behind her BF' back

Implying that she didn't make the boyfriend up to avoid someone who would post this creepy thread.
&gt; Falsely lead you on 

Since when is taking someone out (a nice gesture, are your friends ""leading you on"" if you hang out but don't fuck? If she said something that implied she had feelings for him solely to get a free dinner, that might be considered leading him on. But from the post it seems like she was only accepting a friendly invitation. 
&gt;She's a terrible person

WTF??? Women are terrible people if they are friendly with members of the opposite sex but don't date them? This is a very strong statement to make about someone if you know nothing about them. For a place so keen on slut-shaming and rape victim blaming

Here we have another lovely anecedote
&gt;Fun story: I also went on a 'date' with a girl but she made the mistake of telling me that she had a boyfriend DURING dinner. She had ordered an appetizer, I asked for 2 bills and what to be on what bill. She looked at me like I was retarded and said 'Why did you do that?' I said 'What? Why would I pay a bill for just a friend?' Suffice to say, we never spoke again.
Before this

This comment pissed me off for two reasons. One: it makes it seem like the only reason you should be friends with a women is if you think sex will come out of it

The top comment seems at first to be a concern about accidentally posting in a thread that is also linked to in subredditdrama. The most upvoted response to that is that it is just not ok to post in threads subredditdrama linked you too. I'll quote the response to that here for your convenience: 

&gt;[Okay. So they did. So? Simply seeing that SRD has linked it means it's now off limits to me? Fuck that. If there is an interesting conversation going that I want to participate it

The fuck-you-i-like-this-mentality is all over reddit. Weed should be legal because I enjoy it. Pirating is fine because I benefit from it. Kids should not be in r/aww because I don't think they're cute. Reposting something every day is ok because I haven't seen it. Taking creepshots is fine because I like looking at them. TIL something I already knew

This mentality can never be good for reddit as a whole, some poor specific sub might suddenly have a thread full of idiots that don't know what they're talking about. Just [look what happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/yewkx/nh_this_spider_killed_a_snake_in_my_basement_what/) when a user in WTF was advised to post in /r/whatsthisbug. That subreddit is meant for identifying bugs and sharing some information on them. Eventually the top reply came from someone who actually answered the question (it took him some time to rise to the top over all the useless speculation and lame jokes), and could have lead to some more discussion about what the spider was doing to the snake, or about if he made the correct identification, but that won't happen because 'lol relevant username', which gets highly upvoted, because fuck you I think it's funny!

I'll stop here because I don't want to get preachy and boring. We are all here on reddit for our own entertainment, it's about sharing stuff that is supposed to be interesting to OTHER PEOPLE.

There a number of typically reddit jerks in here but the most prevalent is 'girls can get away with anything'. Let's find some examples!

First we have a number of examples asking why the girls weren't charged with anything
&gt;Wow

&gt;No kidding. Perjury

&gt;Got to be contempt of court

&gt;Why were they not charged with perjury?

&gt;Agreed. Can't you sue them for slander? Not for the money

Ignoring the fact that losing a civil court case doesn't immediately make you a criminal

&gt;Framing someone for attempted murder can get you in a lot of trouble. If they were twenty two year old males in Texas they would probably be looking at hard time.

Yup

&gt;Not when you're a teenage girl. They probably got cookies too

Even worse than being a teenage girl

&gt;According to SRS

A little bit of anti-SRS jerk mixed in with the women can accuse men of anything and get away with it.

&gt;So long as your female. Try being a guy and accusing a girl of anything. Doesn't work nearly as well.

Not really much more to say, where any male interacting with any child can immediately be accused of being a pedophile and have his life permanently ruined by those damn women. In every single form of this 'men can be accused of anything' jerk, it's always a female accusing them, which is important to notice. Not to be too SRS-lite, but this is a pretty good display of reddits resentment of women. Here's someone who really does hate high-school girls.

&gt;Are you serious when you say you don't know any girls that cruel? High school girls are literally the worst human beings on the planet. In a city not far from me just the other year a group of high school girls locked a boy with downs syndrome (or FASD
High school girls can literally be worse than Hitler. Too many of them are brought up with no empathy, but they are definitely the ones who drive a kid to do it.

You heard it here first folks, given it literally is just spewing hate at high school girls, but then I remembered that this for pretty much every group they dont' like. Replace women with 'black people' and high school girls with 'nigger', and it's pretty much the same thing. As in, I don't hate women, I just hate high school girls.

However

&gt;I'm from Holland

As a le superior European, why did the case take 3 whole years? But at the same time, it fits right into reddit's Europe = Good, America = Bad circlejerk. Surprisingly, the responses upvoted for this are actually reasonable, and the downvoted ones were the typical circlejerk.

**EDIT:** *Upon re-reading this

A couple downvoted jerky comments:
&gt;Basically in America, you are fucked.

Yup. Leave it to reddit to generalize actual issues

&gt;Quite simply

Given the rest of the thread

Anwyays, as in ""Someone should slap those bitches"", and that's probably a jerk of it's own, or mixed in with the others. Remember, your female overlords are free to accuse you of rape, murder, and pedophelia at any point in time, be alone with children

1. Go fuck yourself. This is a crucial step, but whatever tool you have available it fine, even if it is a portal gun.

3. Unsubscribe. You don't HAVE to be here, and dumbasses on facebook. Red button on the right. Go away, we don't want you.

4. Repeat step 1 again.

5. Understand our user base. If you live in the UK, whom stay in the proverbial closet to prevent bad shit from happening to them. This includes something as trivial as being cut off from college (which in the US is not a right, but a paid privilege), to something as sever as being thrown in the streets or (in the rare case) murdered. There have been users on here asking for help due to parents wanting to involuntarily commit them to a psyche ward for their atheism. This subreddit is for them to vent.

6. Repeat step 1

7. We have every reason to hate religion. While we don't necessarily hate religious people, Sudan, and the Bible Belt, especially among this particular faith known as Christian Science, which believes prayer is a legitimate alternative to MEDICINE and SURGERY, which sometimes ends up killing the unfortunate kid.

8. Repeat step one

Disregarding the most upvoted comment for a second

Let's bring our attention back up to the most upvoted comment

&gt; I'm Finnish and until I started going on the internet I didn't realize religion was a thing... I just thought it was something that only weird people did

This is backed up by another highly upvoted comment currently at 982.

&gt; Yes. For the longest time, but obviously (so I thought) no one could really believe in this stuff. So I assumed that they just 'went through the motions' for tradition's sake, or treated religion as a sort of Live Action Role Play, or a strange myth-fandom: some kids were into elves and orcs, some into vampires and werewolves, some into star wars and some into the god thing. It was a shock when - well into adulthood - I figured out that, no, really, really real.

The rest of comments pretty much fall in line with these two.  There are a few things that irk me about these two comments.  First of all, not know that ""regular"" everyday people are religious.  Is it to out of the ordinary to have faith in a higher power?  I try not to feel personally offended by this as my family is religious and not ""weird"" and I am religious as well.  

The second comment is equally as baffling.  I don't know if these comments are placating to Reddit's Nordic centrism or maybe these commentors are lying, like stamp collecting.  It also puts all religion on the same plane as Dungeons and Dragons, which is fun don't get me wrong, but is pretty incomparable to religion.

I think this all goes into Reddit's belief that moderate

http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/18kw9q/driving_high_tested_by_cnn_found_to_be_safer_than/

A site did a very weak study that showed you have to smoke a lot of weed to get super impaired on driving

For reference despite what the article says once the daily smoker got high he started knocking shit right over. Keep in mind that the link doesn't mention that.

&gt;I wish Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters would test this out

 Starts off strong with this reaching the top. DAE Mythbusters and Science?!

&gt;The problem with getting high and driving is that it effects everyone different and depends on how regularly you smoke (among other variables). Myself

I've got friends who drive BETTER high so maybe the truth is in the middle.

&gt;That's the great thing about driving high is that if you're too high to drive you know it. If you're too drunk to drive on the other hand your stupid drunk brain tricks you into thinking your okay to drive.

Man guys pot sure makes us superior in every way to drinkers


&gt;I still don't know how I feel about high driving. I've done my fair share of stupid things, but I believe that stance is too broad. Chemicals affect us all differently. I can't drive on a cup of coffee. I'm too wired. I know some people who feel the same way. But we are of the caliber who despise caffeine, and won't ingest it. So I'm sure there's a lot of you who can only drive while caffeinated. The other problem with the preemptive approach is the same problem that I think occurs with a lot of other things such as anti-smoking commercials, and abstinence only sex education. There's just to many confounding variables to adhere to one cookie cutter standard. We should really be a nation founded on observational, and when applicable experimental, studies. Unfortunately, we're a very preemptive nation. Social stigma and taboos drive our policies. If a nation wide observational study was conducted 

A lot of words to say because some people are different laws are bad.

Then this awesome chain.

&gt;I figured. I feel more focused when I'm high and driving

&gt;I used be a pizza man

&gt;I knew this I love driving high! windows down nice cool wind and great music

So, is a gem of a jerk in itself: 

&gt;""Yoko was and is a terrible

Because the idea that Yoko Ono wasn't wonderful has *never* been seriously entertained by this website before

As a parent, its the children it spawns that I resent even more. The first child points out that John Lennon was a jerk, as though that has any relevance to Yoko Ono's qualities, and from there on it's irrelevant [username-reference](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/154w08/til_julian_lennon_had_to_buy_back_postcards_sent/c7jf73v). This is par for the course but its just weird to me that, among the highest visible comments, with a significant number of upvotes (compared to any other comment on any sub), is a failed attempt at noticing a username, its just lame.

Some of the totally useless

&gt;""You are right

Which is responded to with: ""oh i am familiar with her work, so how does that effect me ya know? no, she is a terrible human being, as evidenced by nearly everyone who ever had the misfortune to meet her. picture courtney love as an asian, thats basically who yoko ono is.""

&gt;""What a gold-digging bitch."" +329 (At least this is in some kind of reference to the submission's point

&gt;""And she wonders why she's the most hated woman in the world..."" +165 

Etc. Etc., that jerk in which all of Reddit suddenly becomes arbiters of what is and isn't art.

To preface an aesthetic discussion, cohesive theory of art, that the very question ""what is art,"" is almost impossible, and that all of the key theories (representationalism, expressionism, formalism, etc) fail in key ways to qualify certain aspects of what art is. The point is

But that doesn't stop everyone who can pass a judgment on demand to judge art as though art is ONE thing and ONE thing only. Not just Yoko Ono's art, because apparently all art that isn't pretty painted pictures is basically the same.

There are a lot of these comments under the parent comment thread, its not supposed to sound like pop music, it's performance art,"" which brings on the following aesthetic philosophies:

&gt;""Call it whatever you want

(Interestingly,"" which receives two almost identical replies totally devoid of arguments, such as ""nyone can scream into a microphone in different patterns and tones. Arguably, anyone can paint as well, but it takes a bit more skill with a brush and talent with colors. I've been more emotionally moved by a Matisse than I ever will by Yoko's ""singing""."" In this case, clearly art = emotional response, which suggests that this user subscribes to an expressionist school of theory)

&gt;""Yoko Ono is to music what that woman with the Spaghetti-Os in her vagina is to art.""

&gt;""People fucking APPLAUDED that?!""

&gt;""Oh

(Oh

All of that's from the parent comment. The second comment is full-on attacking performance art. It starts with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/154w08/til_julian_lennon_had_to_buy_back_postcards_sent/c7jcepe). Which leads to:

&gt;Q: ""What was that?"" A: ""Shit. Absolute shit."" (+573 together)

&gt;""People actually clapped and cheered.. wtf.. I dont even want to know how much she was paid to do that."" (+118)

&gt;""Because performance art is fake art. If people truly felt emotion from the art, because they are waiting for some special hidden meaning to strike them, but it never happens. The applause isn't even out of pity or respect, the applause is part of the act and fakery of performance art."" +427

This bad boy is the one that got to me. Although midway in a stream of comments with dwindling karma, wow, so beautiful, eloquent, this, literally this, *Probably the most succinct description of performance art and it's audience I've ever read, sucking that huge brave cock dry. One astute Redditor writes, with no breaks. 

Here's a nice little anecdote about why modern art is not real art: ""In college
""Oh wow

Oh wait. That didn't provide any argument at all. 

&gt;""I think shes mentally ill ever since i saw that video""

&gt;""Jesus Christ. Where can I sign up to make gibberish sounds and dress up artsy and be paid for it?""

&gt;""The sound of an asshole orgasming."" +117

&gt;""She gives new meaning to the term ""piece of shit scumbag dirty diarrhea-eating bukkake toilet party diaper-faced cunt bucket of rhino vomit"""" +27

On and on...

Maybe you don't like Yoko Ono's art, an important part of such fundamental modern artistic traditions as the fluxus movement, John Cage-style composition, etc. One user makes this fairly [clear,](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/154w08/til_julian_lennon_had_to_buy_back_postcards_sent/c7jfvxf) fortunately, and he mentions Dogme 95 as well. The response to this is: ""Well, Dogme 95 produced some legitimately good films, but has it produced anything with an at least moderately wide appeal?"" In other words, mass-produced and on Reddit thrice a day

And the video that everyone keeps using to discredit her... They hate it because it sounds bad to their ears. That is all they can give. They have evaluated the piece beyond no other criteria than, if they understand one fucking iota about these things, they'd realize that Yoko Ono isn't *trying* to provide pop music for you to enjoy? Maybe there's something more going on in her piece than just someone singing something pretty? I swear, Redditors tend to disparage pop music and rap music for being typical and enjoyable, but if something is NOT typical and enjoyable, and not even TRYING to be, it is judged solely on whether it is typical and enjoyable or not. Talk about hating what you don't understand. Fucking gorillas.

I don't know, just because they aren't capable of appreciating any art that wasn't made using Photoshop, a Sharpie, or melted crayons. And those who ARE able to appreciate performance art are clearly faking it, because if they aren't laughing and crying the entire time, they are not engaging in REAL art.

It's *bad form* in the simplest sense of the phrase to behave like that and be so disrespectful, but I know what I like!!!"" while laughing about the penis on Michelangelo's David.

PS: It isn't all bad. A few people try to defend Yoko, Yoko is a pretty disgusting person, 'nuff said, no need to disparage others in her defense, the fact you need to drag other people's names through the mud to make her seem O.K. shows you the depths of her depravity. I've read your comments you don't sound stupid, but, maybe tonight you're feeling a bit bitchy, in any case, NUFF SAID

There is a community for ex-Muslims called, the community prides itself on logical thinking and rationalism.

So naturally, right?

His first post includes this cringe-worthy blog and statement:

&gt;I'm very interested in your feedback. Love? Hate? Tomate? Let me hear it. Here's le link: http://skepticshaykh.wordpress.com/

And the unflinching joyous reaction:

&gt;Oh man

And

&gt;Web sites that highlight the journeys of individuals who've struggled with their faith and where those who are currently questioning can interact directly with the blogger are vital

Yet, he replies:

&gt;My Arabic isn't strong enough for me to write anywhere near at the same level. =(

This person also seems to be having a real identity crisis. When he posts in /r/Exmuslim, he howls and says that nobody should ever be allowed to treat him as an ""outsider to the Muslim community."" I can't find it now, but I remember a post at some point asking why it wasn't okay to be a ""non-Muslim Muslim."" 

No matter

Later he declares:

&gt;How to learn more about Islam than most scholars (let alone Muslims) very quickly.

Nobody rush to point out that he hasn't really shown any proof of scholar-level knowledge about the religion in the first place, who is in his early 30's, and has only penned one or two books on Islam and who readily admits he is an amateur in the field and is ""blown away"" when watching those who have done hadith studies their whole life. Nevermind that though, this single person is CLEARLY the source for knowledge because it backs up his premise, right?





**So far, right?**

Skeptic Shaykh decides to take his practice further: he begins visiting other websites and attempting to troll the boards. He is so proud of his efforts that he gleefully declares his superiority in the form of his own threads.

&gt;Muslim blog Suhaibwebb.com decides to write about apostasy. Couldn't resist.

To which he naturally gets a delicious circlejerk.

The worst of it all, educated, highly advanced researcher of Islam shows up, Skeptic Shaykh decides that he is the ultimate David ready to topple this Goliath.

Forget that Skeptic Shaykh is trying to argue against a REAL Muslim Community Leader (while SS doesn't seem to even have evidence of his former leadership at all),"" this much more knowledgeable individual refuses to even call himself a scholar (a title SS believes he can arrogantly outstrip in a couple books and videos). SS still takes on the challenge:

First

&gt; If there's any video/audio of yours I've probably seen/heard it

See

&gt;Quiet frankly after learning more

Unfortunately, and essentially boiled down to ""I was an agnostic myself, I have observed the evidence, and I have made a concerted decision."" Of course, SS declares victory:

&gt;My back and forth with Nouman Ali Khan

And naturally

I'll do a tl;dr for ya'll even though it's a short story.

&gt;I'm in the Army. I've been Special Forces for about seven years now.

So he's army

&gt;as a medic

No man would be perfect without an ounce of science.

&gt;Judy is gay.

Not a choice quote

&gt;[kills an enemy combatant]... I didn't even know this man's name. I didn't really care.

We've got a stoic badass military man not afraid to kill with a living arrangement with a gay woman. 

&gt;I wish I could say that the the final straw hadn't been having to cut into this young man's stomach and remove his intestines and show them to him as he screamed the coordinates in Arabic to my translator. 

So here he is torturing enemy combatants. So what didn't faze our hardened atheist brave soldier caused the translator to cry. This is reading like a wet dream.

&gt;Anyway

What a badass.

&gt;It was at this point that he reached for the phone and I broke his hand. He yelled for his wife to wake up

So in the beginning of the story there was a fellow soldier who gave him shit for killing an enemy combatant. The first kill that I mentioned. He is now at this soldier's house in arkansas. How is he there, and announced that he'd kill the guy in 2 years. Let me repeat the middle part. HE TRANQUILIZED THE WIFE. Oh and by the way, it wasn't his first time in the house. He had been there multiple times before. He was undetected all times before, of course.

&gt;Tina's eyes rolled into the back of her head. She was clearly unconscious. I relented and turned to Judy.

Gay wife gets gay girl friend who convinces gay wife to file for divorce and take his money. Literally. So at a meeting between the three of them, and delivers some speech about being a badass that the gays don't want to mess with. You'll love the conclusion: ""NEEDLESS TO SAY, SHE MOVED OUT."" NEEDLESS TO SAY.

Story ends with him flying to go kill his gay ex wife's family. To be honest

Story could basically be told without the part about him being an introvert or whatever the hell it is redditors call their antisocial asses. This happens a lot on the subreddit

If you're subscribed to /r/cringe, though, and the reason that I'm writing about it, is the assertion that the decline of /r/cringe took place entirely within the last month. It's hilariously clueless, considering how often these posts come about. But there's something deeper here, I think. 

There's an entitlement aspect going on. OP's first comment on /r/cringe? [One month ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/11sqs2/just_click_around_on_scenekidscom_every_profile/c6pc86y) Seriously. I think that people assume that quality has gone downhill, the more the shit stands out to you (and the less you're willing to forgive it.) OP has only been on /r/cringe for one month, we can assume, and one month later he's lamenting the tragic fall of what was once such a great subreddit. You're not entitled to nothing but great content. Maybe try submitting some yourself. Oh wait, turns out he has submitted to the subreddit. Only twice. [The first one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1398o2/that_phantom_load/) got 23 upvotes, and [the second one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/13tkzq/leave_behind_your_carphones_and_beepers_its_time/) got only 3. See, that's perfectly indicative of something else.

What also boggles the mind is that no one on /r/cringe seems to realize how subjective the feeling that the sub is based around actually is. You think that just because you're all on the same website you're all going to cringe at the same stuff? It doesn't make any sense. And on a subreddit where quality is determined by how much you cringed at something

&gt; [To the people bitching about posts like these

Not sure that OP described anything in his post. No statement of what ""true cringe"" actually is, in a lot of ways, the opposite of /r/Frisson, a great subreddit which you should check out. The feeling of frisson is just as subjective as cringing, but there, the users are aware that differences in opinion are inevitable and don't write bitchy posts about how we need to ""bring back true frisson!"" 

Now, but it's still at the top of the subreddit with over 1000 upvotes at the time of this writing. And you can bet that there'll be another post just like it with just as many upvotes next week. Why is this?

You see, of course. OP has only been around for a month. But it gives them a sense of power to be able to say, ""Well, back in my day, /r/cringe was much better than the shit we have nowadays!""

I cannot be an apologist for the democratic party because, perhaps they are choreographed to play the faux opponent until most Americans forget how awful republican policies were to their economic interests.
Don't even start about fiscal responsibility. Under Dubya, nothing was paid for since they abolished the ""pay as you go"" rule established under Clinton.

Sure, you can be an individual, code for ""you're on your own,"" and forget about Medicare and Social Security that you paid into your whole life.

Oh cool.  In a thread that specifically asks republicans what they believe

&gt;[My father and a few friends are Republican voters. When I ask them why
Invest into research and development\(R&amp;D\). This ideally means the corporation will become more competitive
Give back to their employees in the ways of pay increases
Create more jobs because of the excess of income. Ideally this is great. It doesn't happen, ""Why would I want to invest in a country when I can just save tons of money overseas, not have to worry about unions, get better interest in oversea banks and have little to no taxes?""
They have more arguments but those are generally the first things that come out. Gay marriage/abortion/failing middle class are the follow-ups.
TL;DR The republicans I know are idealistic about how the economy should work

Well this comment is better I guess

By the way

Edit: Here's a 14th example from one hour after I submitted this post, Reddit.

I actually agree with Reddit's general position on this, insult Christians, insult the FCC (an example Reddit's anti-Government libertarianism, popping up when most convenient to them), insult people whose values are different than their's, and to circlejerk over how much more logical they are than others in this OBVIOUSLY objective valuation of media content.

Of course, the threads never have answers or a good back and forth debate or discussion.

I also think this jerk encompasses a lot of other Reddit jerks in one delicious neopolitan jerk. Or perhaps tutti-frutti. (BTW, fat chicks, and Amerilards?) To butcher the Coen Brother's True Grit, I shall try to explain how this encompasses these other jerks, but let us restrict the conversation to the /r/BreakingBad thread(s) so that we may have a manageable figure of examples to work with!

One of Reddit's theories: [Fucking plebeian Americans!](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5vtqb9)

Never-mind the fact that America has plenty of shows like The Sopranos, Sex &amp; The City, Lucky Louie, with uncensored swearing on premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime. Obviously [MURRICA](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/zc9tw/tv_network_logic/c63dita) (lol, get it, guys, Rednecks yell things like MERICKA!) must be the problem. Notice when [user Kranar attempts to argue that it has nothing to do with America, to -16 points. Reddit really hates nuance.

More of Kranar getting downvoted:

&gt;Plenty of American media contains vulgar language, another American channel, it would not have had any censorship.

[-16 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5w07hx) for stating a fact. Clearly those downvotes are well deserved

&gt;HBO is premium cable, AMC can't, it's as simple as that. I think exceptions are made if they put up disclaimers, but I doubt AMC wants to air a 10 second disclaimer after each commercial break.

[+7 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5w0fk0) for stating something very similar Kranar did. This guy CONFIRMS Kranar's point, even though that's Kranar's point.

&gt;Okay fine

[-5 downvotes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5w0k8c) NEGATIVE FIVE DOWNVOTES. At this point in reading the thread Jorge blacked out and woke up three hours later with his temples smelling of dried blood. Weird.

But it's not just MURRICA

When people object to this obvious oversimplication they get downvoted. [-3 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/zc9tw/tv_network_logic/c63q9a1) [-13 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/zc9tw/tv_network_logic/c63ozcg) [-37 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/zc9tw/tv_network_logic/c63dvys)

That last link has a whole tree of SRD-style quality popcorn!

That's why! That's the answer

[The man who brought us /r/Jailbait explains that this is because AMERICANS HATE SEX but LOVE violence](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/zc9tw/tv_network_logic/c63edwu) +28 points.

&gt;""Fuck"" means ""sex""

This comment pretty much sums up the entire jerk in one sentence. The creator of a subreddit that was shut down for distributing child pornography criticizing puritanical MURRICA for hating profanity &amp; sex (which are the same thing is his statement) but not violence. Everyone knows America LOVES violence, ""I fingered Jane's corpse"" is perfect. Sublime. Bliss. Rage.

Again, and conversation is cut off. But let me provide some theories about. First, here's perhaps why Reddit gets so up in arms about this one:

Reddit loves to think of itself as a drastic and edgy website, so that media content can't affect them. 

Reddit thinks they're mature because they like ""mature"" themes in their media and have a youthful arrogance and excitement over ""taboo, which involves moderation. Reddit is stuck in a responsibility-less adolescent view of media, a hedonistic, anything goes love of novelty and edginess.

Now

The reason violence is more acceptable on basic cable and broadcast television than profanity and nudity is because violence is simulated and whereas nudity and profanity cannot be.

It's the same reason I can watch a Scorsese film and enjoy it, scars me for life. And Reddit knows this. That's why they insist posts like that be tagged with NSFL, even on subreddits like WTF. Violence in fictional television &amp; film is ABSTRACTED, removed from reality, even if it's done with realistic make-up and effects. We know it's 100% not real.

Nudity, your child is ACTUALLY seeing a womans actual breasts or vagina, or a man's real penis. It's not all that abstracted or simulated.

Swearing is even more immediate, it's extremely easy for her to ignore the graphic violence, which she hates, or even the nudity. She feels completely comfortable doing so, it's easy for her to block out and ignore, and is again, abstracted. But when Pesci starts in with saying ""fuck this,"" my mom is hearing it

It starts with [this post.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iu67f/xmen_first_look_days_of_future_past_posters_split/) X-men posters. Apart from accusations of /r/hailcorporate or whatever, we only allow *new* posters, or OC fan art (we support the idea of people celebrating movies so much that they make sculptures/posters on their own, as long as they aren't in /r/movies just to sell their work, which is illegal due to intellectual property laws).

Then a few days later [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/) appeared, and in a nutshell, this was our modmail exchange:

Me: 

----------

For one

Two

Third

and Fourth

Nothing personal. I dig what you did, but it's not on our front page anymore. Hope you understand.

-------------

then the user:

-----------

Sigh.  I hate burning bridges

So, it was not a response to another post.  I might have first seen the posters (low res, covered in watermarks and URLs) in the Reddit feed awhile back, but I discovered and modified them only after viewing the much newer high res pics on [Superherohype](http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178381-hi-res-versions-of-the-new-x-men-days-of-future-past-posters) this morning.  I even linked directly to their pics at first, but the links soon broke, so I migrated them over to imgur.

Two, and properly aligned, whereas the originals were *not*) or fan art should matter.  If it were a superfluous fix, I'd understand.  But then again, I wouldn't expect it to have been so popular, were that the case, so clearly I had the majority's support.  And isn't that the point of Reddit's pseudo-democratic system, more on that in a bit.

Three, and more, including such topics as multi-actor based characters in other movie franchises as well.  Discussions which are still going on right now.  (well, as of the time I started typing this, anyway)  [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbaslk6)  [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbasn13)  [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbavmew) [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbatg8u) [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbasvjw)  Why that's to be *discouraged*, I could only guess..  (don't support independent film criticism, perhaps? \*shrug\*)

and Four, then that subreddit's *community* no longer matters, and I do *not* think that's the kind of message you want to be sending to *anyone*.  Your job as a moderator is to keep things in line.  Review flagged comments.  Make sure posts (mostly) adhere to the rules.  If and when the users skirt those rules, it should be up to the rest of the community to decide whether or not they support that divergence, by voting it *up* or *down.*  If you disapprove, then you should *voice* such disapproval *in reply.*  That's what your nifty little green name tag is for, after all!  What you should *not* do, is tear that post down without any given notice, then that means the mods are picking the winners and the losers

*Finally, that you would do that for me.  \*condescending finger twirl\*  You know, *because I totally do it all for the points!*

\*clears throat\*

But don't get me wrong.  It's nothing personal.  I dig that you're a pro Redditor and all.  I'm sure you're very good it.  I mean, not if you've any intention to continue moderating like *this*, anyway.

Good day.

*PS:  My favorite movies are, and Mr. Nobody.*

-------------------------

I didn't argue

Then today one of the other mods noticed [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1j71nm/edward_snowdens_not_the_story_the_fate_of_the/cbbvdo0) from our bitter user. I'm not even sure where he got this theory

So what is he referring to? Therein lies the mystery of this entire post. I'm one of the most active mods and I can't account for any behavior that he's accusing us of, 607 upvoted him, by RES count.

Then we got [this guy](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1j71nm/edward_snowdens_not_the_story_the_fate_of_the/cbbwe2z) with his 45 upvotes.

There's a massive amount of attempted pscyho-analysis of our moderation but *no one asks us anything*. We've been [enormously transparent](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/yrbmq/if_we_cant_talk_about_piracy_can_we_talk_about/) whenever [a meta post](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ir79m/psa_if_you_tell_someone_there_is_a_twist_in_a/cb7alxs?context=3) pops up. 

So what we have is dozens to hundreds of redditors trying to make broad generalizations about moderators *with no evidence* and actively rejecting any testimonial from actual moderators. At that point

Now moderator-hating is nothing new

But the truly fascinating thing, because it's boring as hell and not nearly the puppet-master operation that reddit thinks it is. Is it because reddit is just insecure and hates any form of authority? I'm sure that's a large part of it, but I also think that reddit needs something to complain about to feel superior to their surroundings, as well as have an entity to blame for their unhappiness.

Now our original user in this situation isn't a target here so much as just another example in this whole dynamic. It happens once a month

Everytime I see a thread like that /r/worldnews one, we get massive amounts of negativity from people who haven't the slightest idea what they're talking about. And there's *always* going to be unhappy people, because if daily moderating a default sub for 18 months has taught me anything, it's that a) Can't make everyone happy, and b) The people cannot govern themselves.

&gt;It's my fear that this game is built for those first 6 hours.

Yes. Maxis built an entire game building up ***specifically for this one moment: so that the early previews of the game are glorious!***

&gt;Sorry

Oh. We jumped into the DRM stuff quite fast. But then we have someone that dares to counter the anti-DRM jerk and mentions that it's nice to hear something about the game other than said ranting!

&gt;Thank god /r/simcity changed or I would've never learned anything about the game other than ""EA bad, game garbage."" I've seen quite a few threads in /r/SimCity that had good discussions over gameplay, city efficiency, etc. It's actually the only place in all of reddit that has any meaningful discussion of what SimCity is as a game and what its features are.

But then /r/Games has to be /r/Games again.

&gt;A popular opinion doesn't have to be wrong. The DRM is bad and needs to be mentioned as much as possible

DRM is so bad that we should probably talk about it in church

&gt;Sorry

&gt;I actually do. I see it being downplayed to much applause all the time because it's apparently ""annoying"" to see all this negativity. There plain aren't all that many things that can be discussed about a game. That PC Gamer preview didn't contain a single new piece of information for me. You'll see the same points being made over and over again because that's all there is to discuss.

What?

So he's saying that the fact that the previews are all talking about the things that they love about the game is proof that that's all there is to it? So it must be bad? And that DRM is terrible but people on /r/Games simply don't listen

&gt;This is the same PC Gamer that gave Dragon Age 2 a 94/100 score
Pardon me if I take what they say with a grain of salt.

Ah

And here's my favorite quote of the thread...

&gt;There is no jerk. That kind of DRM is unnecessary

This is an /r/Games mod chiding a user for buying into the anti-anti-DRM jerk while also promoting the anti-DRM jerk. As such

I'm sorry, developers do lose money to pirated copies and this is their way of dealing with that. ""But Gaben said!"" blah blah blah. Newell isn't the only voice in the game industry and there are many just as influential as he is that disagree with his position. What's more, Valve operates uniquely in the industry, as they have a small staff that is funded by an online store, whereas companies like Activision, Ubisoft, EA, so piracy can cost jobs there. Meaning that Valve can afford to say things like ""the best way to combat piracy is to make better games"" and then spend 7 years making a single title. 

/r/Games is no longer useful. It's circlejerkness is now on par with /r/gaming but it's so wrapped in pretention that I find it even less palatable. Shame

The first thread post: 
&gt;I hear people say that they wish the government could sterilize people who shouldn't be parents without realizing that in fact

The post immediately under it
&gt;My ex's mother was pressured into sterilization by the state of california after her 8th child

And so it begins!
&gt;In Ireland they would probably give her a prize and encourage her to have more :(

Because Ireland is the land of the drunk Catholifags

Queue Irish jokes:
&gt;I have a joke. What do you call an Irishman in your back yard? Paddy O'Furniture!

&gt;What do you call an Irishman in a suit? The defendant

But wait! There's oh so much more!

&gt;That is entirely too many kids.

So some of them should be taken hostage and used as leverage to have their mother sterilized? All questions of responsibility aside

&gt;Good for the state of California.

Yes

&gt;Is it wrong that I think that's awesome?

Yes it is. 

 &gt;  Lastly, if so, what characteristics is this ethically justifiable?
Yes. People with genetic diseases shouldn't be allowed to procreate.

Thank you for deciding that for everyone. Now let's go abuse some people who are disabled. 

Perhaps these enlightened neckbeards should read the stories of those who were forcefully sterilized for being ""feeble-minded"" and learn of the pain and humiliation they experienced. Perhaps they could then rethink their faux-provocative stance.

Notice the elegant use of 'they' and 'we, the poster states a desire to vote for Le Pen - who for the uninitiated leads the far-right  'Front National' Party [FN], who are considered fascists by many (hence the title) Its very interesting to note that the FN are led by the virulently anti-muslim, Marine Le Pen who is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, a previous leader of the party who was openly anti-semetic and questioned the holocaust.

So this guy wants to start a business selling homemade hammocks. He says he 'just wants to test the waters to see if this will be a profitable endeavor'

I'm not sure what led him to land on the selling price of $30. He says the materials alone will cost $20. This really makes me question the kind of value this guy puts on his time. The U.S. minimum wage is $7.25. He needs to be making one hammock every 1 hour 20 minutes to keep up with the MINIMUM WAGE RATE (and that's forgetting other expenses).

Maybe it's a ploy to get people to click the orange arrow and he hasn't disclosed the real price. He says he just wants to 'test the waters' first:

At least the [highest rated response](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19y3x9/my_dad_is_a_street_preacher_my_brother_is_a/c8sfnxj) to this is reasonable.  Which is really my biggest problem with this subreddit.  I love theology/philosophy of religion, but in order to get any traffic/views/appreciation of their posts they have to hijack and reply to implicitly ignorant and naive comments.  But even this response has 1/3 as many upvotes.

The [third biggest](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19y3x9/my_dad_is_a_street_preacher_my_brother_is_a/c8sdvg3) comment.  I don't even want to talk about it.  Just read it.

I get that in the first place the dad is being an ignorant asshole, two ignorant assholes don't make a truth.  I don't personally believe in any God, but the extent to which Atheists, no matter how much they try to separate themselves from the core movement, are uneducated about religion actually appalls me.  When I first came to Reddit I loved /r/trueatheism because you could have intelligent discussion.  Now it is just the same Facebook posts we see on /r/atheism posturing as intellectual discussion.

The core thing that strikes me about Reddit/internet atheism in general is that it assumes biblical literalism is the only way to interpret the bible, however, there is no actual understanding of any of the scientific principles OP talks about, just a general jerk about how brave the Atheist was to tell their oh so ignorant parent the truths of the world, but how their attempts to better their families lives will be met in vain, because they have already given themselves up to the evil of God (sounds like a very evangelical position to me, just with some words rearranged/added/changed because evangelical Atheism is **in no way** influenced by evangelical Christianity.  I swear)

TLDR; The typical Reddit atheist circle-jerk about how I am so much more intelligent than the straw men arguments I create about the religions I don't understand.

Basically, if you aren't of the mindset that imposing any limitations on sex is stupid, I've seen much, and have no desire to ever have sex. I cannot tell you how many people

""There are already certain American cities in which the number of divorces is equal to the number of marriages. In a few years, good for a period of twelve months, with no law against changing dogs or keeping more than one animal at a time. As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase. And the dictator (unless he needs cannon fodder and families with which to colonize empty or conquered territories) will do well to encourage that freedom. In conjunction with the freedom to daydream under the influence of dope and movies and the radio, it will help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is their fate.""

The thing is Redditors only tolerate people who don't want sex, ""You're free to not have sex (even though this decision is immature and ignorant) but stop thinking you have the right to police my body or shame people for expressing their sexuality."" What prompted this? I commented in a thread that about college or something, ""I have no interest in sex, college hasn't exactly been a 'blast' for me seeing as how most social get togethers center around it at least indirectly.""

&gt;[don't be melodramatic - no one is calling you a ""LOSER"" I don't know how old you are, I will say your perspective is very immature. Look Evan, at the end of the day it is 100% your choice to abstain from sex till marriage. However, a strong physical relationship is very often an integral part of a strong marriage. And guess what? You won't figure out sexual compatibility until you actually start having sex. A strong relationship has a number of integral characteristics. Physical intimacy, according to any study you read on what makes a good relationship, is one such characteristic. How you can jump into a lifelong commitment without knowing that you are a good fit is beyond me. Please don't tell me that you will magically be good together in the sack - trust me, we all make that assumption when we are madly in love with someone. However, its what you're doing several years into the relationship. of course

Sure, some places have the champaign room where you can indulge in extras, but it sounds like you are with a guy who wouldn't want that anyway.

-------

&gt;[Why wouldn't it be socially acceptable?
I honestly don't understand your perspective on this. At all.
Background on why:
I've only ever been in 2 committed relationships and both times the girl had cheated on me within 2 months. Every single other relationship that I've ever been in (including the girl I am with right now who I've been with for almost 2 years) have been open relationships. I have never cared who they did things with (as long as they weren't fat, or I had a personal vendetta against them) and I have done things with others as well. We have done things with others as couples. The whole idea of being turned off because your partner was with another person is just ridiculous to me.
Furthermore can you honestly say that you don't look at/read porn? I see no difference between that and going to a strip club. Just have him shower first. Maybe my perspective is warped because I don't understand jealousy or commitment

Edit: The comments below have produced the following answer: Cleavage is socially acceptable for attached women to show because it's not inherently sexual. I think this answer is quite applicable to the question of strip clubs
I'd argue that going to a strip club is not an inherently sexual act when done in the context of a bachelor party. It's done as a tradition
I've been to strip clubs in this context, strip clubs generally disgust me), and spent the entire time bullshitting with the other groomsmen and drinking. We left in under an hour. If we had wanted a sexual activity we would have gone to a local 'massage' parlour and got a round of rub &amp; tugs.
This of course does not apply if the man is visiting the strip club outside of bachelor parties

Often in scenarios like this, there's a few guys that don't even particularly want to go there, they're going for their friend. He's going to see some naked girls, probably not for the first time. And he has less of a chance with making out with or sleeping with a stripper than he has of picking up any random girl anywhere else to cheat on you with. Chill out. TL:DR Sometimes people get naked.

On to the evidence. Let's look at the top links of all time

Of the twenty-five [Top-Scoring](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/top/) links of all time, and the rest are videos.

Of the image posts, be it for the [sheer](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/i6q1e/he_sat_like_this_the_entire_class_period/) [absurdity](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/i21nq/worm_guy/), [incredible](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/rrm4v/18_wheelers_flying_through_the_air_in_a_tornado/) [nature](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/m8of9/til_%E0%B2%A0_%E0%B2%A0/), or [just](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/qox2b/one_of_those_things_that_i_thought_was_a_plant_is/) [plain](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/q3pf9/a_wonderful_story_for_children/) [oddness](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/9e157/microsoft_poland_spot_the_difference/).

The links are all to things that are incredible enough to make one say ""what the fuck"", with much more gore, including murders, severe injury, and good old police brutality (I'll leave you to imagine the comment threads on [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/gqu1l/nypd_gives_guy_a_ticket_for_riding_his_bike_on/) [links](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/i4ocf/officer_with_a_well_known_history_of_violence/)). There are only eight videos on the top page, and only three contain no gore. The ones that are goreless are patently absurd, so they fit as well.

Overall, on topic, and truly WTF-inducing posts.

Let's take a look at the [Hot page as of August 24

That's not a good sign to open things up, not surprisingly, only *one* is labelled as such. Another seven of those posts are rather inane, really. They range from a [modern art display](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/), to a [picture of Conan's head on a My Little Pony body](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypmg3/my_little_cony/), to [someone's medical bill](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yqgu1/my_wtf_i_received_in_the_mail_spent_only_8_hours/) (because fuck the rules on post with political connotations), to a [wedding picture whose only shred of a tie to WTFness being something a bartender purportedly said about the picture](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yq7tv/my_bartender_asked_me_if_i_was_in_a_wedding_with/)

Now, so if you've been avoiding those links, I promise, they're not going to make you puke.

Now, but let's look around at 9:59 am EST for good-quality WTF posts. [This is the page, images closed](http://i.imgur.com/la4Fk.png).

I count eight decent-quality image links that abide by the rules of the subreddit (nine if you allow the MURRIKKKA FUCK YEAH coloring book one). There are two news stories about the shooting in New York City, one about pet food, one about a music video, and one about a FurBQ in New Jersey. Overall, I'd say that the /new page has roughly ten/eleven good-quality posts and I was very surprised that not all of them are image posts (16/25 is a pretty decent record, actually). Still, ten/eleven on /new lines up pretty well with fifteen/sixteen of /hot being decent.

It's sad, I guess I'll scroll through every page ever"" feeling. It *might* have a slim chance of being saved, but only drastic measures can do it at this point in time. Maybe if the mods remove it from defaults. Regardless, /r/WTF has one foot in the defaultcesspool grave.

So the juiciness usually ramps up in the comments so lets go!

Oh an interesting question

&gt;And seriously the guy might be a rapist. Why shouldn't he face the legal system of Sweden?
&gt;&gt;ell if he goes to Sweden

Widely accepted. You heard it heard it on reddit first. Of course there's no source or anything

&gt;As an Australian

Le crusader

&gt;An international law expert said theoretically a hundred people in disguises could enter the embassy and Assange could exit with them disguised as one of them when they all left and the police would not have the power to arrest any of them.

An international law expert? I'm convinced. Let me go get myself tased to protect a rapist!

&gt;As we are british we do no such thing

Hah! British people are sophisticated!

&gt;Do police use tazers in our country now?

Le pigs have weapons to protect themsleves. Fucking assholes.

&gt;The problem is

Completely unfounded conspiracy? Check. Implicit denial of sexual assault? Check.

&gt;I actually laughed out loud when I read this. Have you heard of David Hicks? And nobody cares what he's charged with, and possibly disappeared.

The U.S. would just you know make him disappear

&gt;Since 2001 these laws are essentially worthless with regard to the US. If we need someone

Yeah

&gt;In your honest opinion. Do you think this rape allegation has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with wikileaks and extradition to the US?

In your honest opinion can you really disagree with my conspiracy theory?

&gt;He isn't being charged with rape. In fact

Oh they only said it was sexual assault. That means nothing actually happened. Silly women

&gt;just make assange black

Something about making Assange black or something.

&gt;This works under the assumption that he will receive a fair trial, if he ends up in a court, they are going to bury him, i wouldn't be surprised to see him convicted of rape and put away for the maximum possible time, and if they don't manage to pull that one off, he can simply be sent to the US, either directly or not, they will hand him over like its nothing. As for being shipped to Guantanamo, they will put him away somewhere

Nothing but some AmeriKKKa jerking here.

Finally I'll leave you with this nugget even though it's downvoted since we've decided to go full on tinfoil hat and rape denial.

&gt;I think that Julian assange didn't rape or sexually abuse anyone. I think that this is a set up because he has classified information or because he has revealed classified information. I reckon that the US givernment has influenced certain other governments and are trying to catch him for whatever reason's.

gets chased by this: 

&gt;It always surprises me when people think that this is about 'imaginary internet points'. Do you know how many thousands of dollars advertisers pay for 'imaginary internet points'? Do you have any idea how much revenue can be generated simply by getting people's attention? I'm guessing not, for whom YT views translate to cold hard cash and yes, even reddit karma can be worth money if you know where and how to shop it. It's not quite so obvious that the average schmo can do it, but trust me, there's nothing 'imaginary' about the power of getting thousands of people to look at something.

I'm not one hundred percent sure how this relates to the topic. The idea that youtube likes can translate into advertising revenue isn't exactly new

I hope you all already have your 3D glasses on because the euphoria of that last sentence is practically coming out of the screen. First of all, OP is invoking one of atheists' favourite debating tools in the form of an ad populum logical fallacy. Just because the majority of people think something is true, that doesn't make it objectively true.

Comedy and satire are the way to change people's minds since you need to get them to question their beliefs. It may sound absurd to atheists not brought up in religious households but most people never question their beliefs because they are surrounded by people who don't either. Seeing a funny meme about something stupid in a religion begins the process of getting people to question their beliefs. I only knew about the other insane things Leviticus says (like the not mixing threads etc.) via memes I

Basically OP posts a meme detailing her unfair treatment for reading a book out of her reading level, and its even more ridiculous still to punish them for reading it successfully and writing a report. 


Where it gets downright stupid is when all these redditors come out of the woodwork to wave their reading aptitude results around.


&gt;I sort of had the opposite problem in grade school - I always tested into a reading level of at least twice my actual grade (in fifth grade I tested as reading at almost a 12th grade level). My teachers told my parents I should start reading the Wall Street Journal. Really? Luckily my parents just gave my teacher a funny look and bought me more horse books.


Cool


&gt;Yeah


Oh what are the odds that two people in the same thread-

&gt;Once I discovered real novels in 6th grade my reading level was far too advanced for school. My reading teacher said I was at least 12 grade reading level and I was reading stuff like Stephen King by that point. Read them because I wasn't allowed to see the movies. haha I was too smart for my own good.


Oh are you kidding me? How in the hell is Stephen King considered a book thats at a 12th grade level?


&gt;My English teacher in 11th grade gave an exam at the beginning of the year on everything that we were required to know at the end of the year
I also took the reading test that gauges what your reading level was. Ours went by 100s so every 100 was a grade level

I'm gonna go ahead and call bullshit on this.

This thread is littered with comments like these


Basically I think this stems from the victorian class/caste system, and probably most PEOPLE, believe that being BORN smart is more important than becoming a well read/intelligent person over time. To most people who grew up in a society that has it's roots in a class system it would be more appealing to be born a genius (or born a Noble for the sake of analogy) than to have become one. 


To your common redditor, had an average SAT score, having been identified as 'gifted' or exceptional at an early age makes up for these feelings of inferiority. 

So why is this more prevalent on Reddit than it is in real life? Since most people are average

Well I think this has to do with two things

1: Reddit values intelligence more than other traits


2: Having high intelligence as an inherent trait give credibility to the excuse of ""I'd do it if I weren't so lazy."" Once they've established that they were born with a superior intelligence they can instantly continue to feel superior to everyone. Oh a rocket scientist disagrees with me? Well thats not a big deal

Another circlebroke user named [/u/joke-away](http://www.reddit.com/user/joke-away) has already masterfully explained why we have so [many problems with fluff thanks to reddit's current content ranking algorithm](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f).

&gt;Reposts also have an advantage- people already having seen them

What he missed is that reposts have more going on in the background rather then people just upvoting them because they have already seen them. Let's explore this idea of why and how stereotypes/familiar content effect every redditor.

**Why Reddit Loves to Hate Things**

Reddit loves to hate things. A small list of the most recent popular ""hated"" topics include:

* Islam
* Mitt Romney
* Yolo
* EA
* Women in a Divorce
* Americians
* Christians
* Pro-life people
* TSA
* Republicians

I could go on for a while longer about things reddit ""hates"". The thing that ties these all together is that reddit loves to hate (and by hate, and [this a thread comparing believing in religion to being drunk](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10iqya/religion_is_no_different_than_being_drunk/). There are plenty more examples to find. A good place to start looking would be the top submissions category for each medium to large subreddit.

Now, EA (literally Hitler), Christians, and Republicians. So why do posts like these often hit the frontpage/get many more upvotes compared to others submissions? It is because of the positive or negative response tied to the hivemind's stereotype of the word. Let us use the term Yolo as an example.

Yolo is a polarizing word inside of the hivemind's opinion. Anything tied with the word yolo is to be [mocked](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/10050l/you_did_not_just_bring_yolo_into_this/)

&gt; These two started out the night by yelling ""YOLO!""

The keywords ""started the night"" sets the setting. From there the title continues on to "" yelling YOLO!"". The point of those two words is to get you to love to hate the post. You hate the people in the post because they yelled yolo. You don't know the people

**People want to upvote things that go with the hivemind.** It gives them a sense of community and a sense of ""I know what is right! DEBATE ME!"" That is why anti-islam xenophobic posts are so common right now. That is also why /r/atheism and /r/politics have such a predictable circlejerk. 

_____________________

**The Reddit Beast**

The reddit beast is the predictably irrational hivemind that influences everything in the reddit universe. According to science/economics we should be able to predict the trends, one thing we all know about humans is that *we are not always ""rational""*. Usually emotions and feelings will cloud our (and therefore the hivemind's) ability to make the ""correct"", trends/decisions/thoughts. The reason why the reddit beast exists is because we like to have a community of like-minded opinions. We still remain predictable while in the hivemind (hence the ability to use the same key words/stereotypes again and again), but we also continue to be irrational (hence the ability to use constantly negative stereotypes to get upvotes).

The reddit beast likes these stereotypes as they tell them what to believe. Contrary to reddit's belief, religion, fads, politics, companies, money, or opinions is bound to get upvotes if the title is correctly worded.

To correctly title a submission/comment

The title of this submission: 

&gt; Christian right wing group 'Focus on the Family' Humiliated by Al Franken

Key words desired to create a love-to-hate effect:

* Christian
* right wing
* humiliated

The entire submission's title was created to inspire the hivemind to upvote without thought. Two negative ""love-to-hate"" words are prominently displayed in the title. To encourage you to quickly create an emotion based decision included is the ""call to action"" key-word ""humiliated"" which makes you feel like you won something.

_____________________

**Why We Tame The Beast**

Reddit's hivemind wants to love-to-hate things. People want to have stereotypes because stereotypes are productive at making predictable emotional responses easy to upvote or downvote. No matter how much the hivemind may deny it

Effectively
__________________________________________________

Reddit will likely continue this trend into the future. With older stereotypes being stomped out, there is little chance we will be able to fight this irrational, emotion driven hivemind voting. 

On a good note

**TL;DR** Reddit loves to use it's own predictable irrationality to use emotion loaded/stereotypical topics to shoot low-effort/derogatory/spiteful comments/submissions to the top.

Admittedly, I'll admit. But it feels to me like the only reason that Redditors harp on about Israel is because it's one of the few international issues they actually know about. They want to appear knowledgeable, worldly and empathetic, but they don't put any effort into it. Speaking of which:

&gt;There is absolutely no comparison between the way people lived in Syria and how things are in Saudi Arabia. I spent a good amount of time there as a kid and to this day people from there still think highly of the Assads. It was also the most Christian-friendly country in the middle east before this shit started going down
edit for clarification: I stayed in Syria.

So, it's a contrarian statement, and so it gets up votes. Below, there is a reply from an actual Syrian:

&gt;You're right, I have to inform you that the reason we have portraits of the Assads all over the place, from restaurant windows to taxi cab rear-view mirrors, and the reason we speak highly of them, is not respect. It's because if you're seen or heard speaking against them, you're likely to get imprisoned or killed. Sure, some people might actually support them
I've spent several years in Syria overall, they would hush me up immediately and cover up my mistake, even if it was on the balcony of their own apartment, or within our own car with the windows down. It's fear, not respect.
It's what finally spurred this war. If he was so thought of so highly, just before the actual fighting began. We haven't heard from him since and have no idea what has happened to him. Also, his apartment was held by Assad's secret service for months and cleared out before they abandoned it.
And you're right, you have to understand that it's because of how uninvolved his government was. Nothing really ever happened domestically. I once asked my my aunt (grew up in Syria, but studied in Germany and is a practicing doctor who had her office burned down by Assad's secret service for treating wounded women and children near the start of it all) about the court system in Syria and she laughed and said that nobody in our family has ever had any experience with it. I'm only 22 and live in the U.S. and I've already been to court here at least a dozen times.

You'll see it all the time in any thread with a picture or description of a pig. This is commonly dubbed the ""bacon circlejerk, unlike a thread in which Redditors post offensive content and attempt to justify it, the bacon circlejerk requires no forethought of any sort. This brand of comedy is a staple of unclever teenagers and really isn't exclusive to Reddit. It's not hard to imagine a group of kids wandering around the zoo, pointing out each baby animal of which they'd like to get a taste. There's no intellectual content in a comment like that, and it gets old pretty quickly. It's puerile humor to be sure, but I begrudge them their jokes. I've heard worse, and I've heard more offensive.

My concern, it's impossible to avoid. Unlike in real life, where a joke can only be repeated once before it gets old, it takes little to no effort to post a two-worded reply to a picture insinuating that the commenter sees the subject as little more than a meal. There's no give-and-take, only a one-sided, snide remark. Whereas a typical circlejerk might appear in this format:

     -Boy
    
        -It sure is. Check out this meme I made.
            
            -Man

                -I know

The bacon circlejerk will instead appear in this format:

      -Mmmm

      -Yummy yummy in my tummy.

      -I could never be vegetarian. Bacon is just too tasty and delicious.

      -Pigs are cute

It just never ends. It's everywhere, since there's not usually much to remark on. Mostly personal anecdotes and compliments and the like. Today, though, I was curious enough about the animal in question and the locale that I decided to poke through the comments section hoping for a little more information. That was a mistake.

And that brings us to today's subject, there's almost nothing but. Without further ado, I give you a small sample of the bacon circlerk (or in this case, burger circlejerk) that shows up in the thread in question.

Keep in mind, these comments constitute a good quarter of the thread's comments section, not that I should be surprised.

Now, not similar. *Identical*. These comments—which are, in fact, duplicated verbatim—seem to indicate that the authors of these remarks didn't even bother to look inside the thread in which they're posting. And here is my problem. It's not that this circlejerk is annoying (which it is) or that I don't care for the content (which I don't); it's that this circlejerk is so utterly anti-content that it's hard to even approach the thread without being bombarded with exactly the same comment. I'm inclined not to bother wading through it in the first place.

Now, there *is* one comment that attempts to address the bacon circlejerk much more concisely than the essay I'm writing for you all:

&gt;We get it. You guys love talking about how it will be delicious. That is not what /r/aww is about. Please stfu.

&gt; Why [should we be nice to non-believers and treat them with respect]? So they could spread incorrect information?
Listen, wherein vitriolic attacks on religion became mainstream. Thousands attribute their deconversions to Christopher Hitchens and his unrelenting speech against religion.
You want to know how to eliminate religion? Ridicule. It's the most effective idea-shaping tool since we discovered language.

""the most effective idea-shaping tool since we discovered language"", i dont know if any of you guys have read any of Dawkins, Dennet, Hitchens, or Harris' material, but it is possibly the worst and most pathetic excuse for ""philosophy"" i have ever seen in my entire life. i mean, Dawkins, attempts to critique the [Ontological Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Anselm) in his book ""The God Delusion"" and not only is it apparent that he has never ever ever ever ever read anything by St. Anselm, its really just dead horse beating combined with teenage angst. And i haven't even gotten started on Dawkins ""central argument"" which would leave anyone who knows what a syllogism is speechless

If any of these idiots who claim that the Four Horsemen are the most ""vitriolic"" movement against religion actually spoke with an *actual Ph.D holder* in philosophy, stay away from the Four.

1366375404.0,1co9ra,I actually think Reddit's obsession with finding those responsible for the Boston massacre is the worst possible move anyone could make,loony636,145,22,52,"From the beginnings of the /r/worldnews mod brewhaha (which has now resulted in the sub becoming almost entirely US-centric again; another circlebroke post perhaps?) to the false accusations from /r/findbostonbombers

Reddit is now taking media sensationalism to a whole new level, Digg, etc.) do: Badly.

**The motivations**

I'm a Reddit cynic and think that /r/karmaconspiracy is probably right a lot more of the time than you would think. But this line in the /r/news [update thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cnwms/mods_removed_thread_live_updates_of_boston/) (after complaining about the mods deleting the previous one) really got me:

&gt; Note to MODS: Don't touch this thread. News and info is needed to keep people safe. Sit behind your computers with all the power you want...but I won't let people die because you are entitled.

Firstly

Secondly, not anything other than that. Nada. Half of the posts were about the status of the officers involved, their current movements or reposting photos of the bombers.

If anyone has a compelling argument for these news threads on the basis of public safety

&gt; EDIT 3:21 EST: Sounds like shots being fired! My fault

Great.

**The information is wrong**

A far more pressing issue is this: The information Redditors post is not only massively sensationalised, is often so wildly speculative it actively harms the pursuit of justice as well as the individuals affected.

Reddit took it to the next level by getting their information from completely unverifiable sources, and the plague that will come on their houses will be unimaginable.

Need more evidence? Look no further than [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/findbostonbombers/comments/1co7kp/mod_note_despite_what_was_allegedly_overheard_on/) thread:

&gt; I'd like to extend the deepest apologies to the family of Sunil Tripathi for any part we may have had in relaying what has turned out to be faulty information. We cannot begin to know what you're going through and for that we are truly sorry. Several users

This is case in point, and that was only really because they caught it before it got too out of control.

From [this news article](http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/sunil-tripathi-missing-student-wrongly-identified-as-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-356334):

&gt; Sunil, Akhil Tripathi, runs a software firm in Pennsylvania. 

But it was even worse because police had to take time out of their day to deal with this shit. Time they could actually be spending combing through the hours of footage they have to, much better to have them deploying their resources to pick up your mess.

The police had to issue further PSAs to shut down the internet information spewing

The reality is that if the police have something they want people to help with

Finally, to a point, crimes against the whole country, they are, at their heart, crimes against individuals. Those individuals will not only see the workings of the sausage factory, they will have their stories exploited for karma

The incessant search for 'truth', don't report it on Reddit: Give it straight to the authorities. If you have wild speculation, don't post it: Keep it to yourself.

**What should happen**

A very long time ago now, it contends the following:

&gt; As a sociologist

I actually think the best approach would be for the police to release very frequent and very comprehensive fact sheets as soon as events like this happen, and should *not* release the names of victims (at least, perhaps, until the family has consented).

Media organisations should take point in shutting down speculation (ala that Newsroom episode), should be key, especially in the area around the attack. The threat will come from new attacks, not the old ones already being investigated.

Let the victims grieve and the police do their jobs. For once don't put your foot in it.

But what kind of circlejerk are we talking about? Mostly, and a few ideas which ooze through each thread. Their common point is that they convey flattery of the average user of this subreddit. In other words, the greatest common divisor becomes what set them apart from the more mundane folks wandering elsewhere. The true nature of a circlejerk. Due to the nature of the subreddit, we won't avoid some amount of technical considerations. I'll do my best to keep them as low as possible.

**Most upvoted threads**

We want to see which ideas are the more upvoted; let's start with a look at the [best threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/top/). An alarm immediatly sounds in the head of any savvy reader of CircleBroke: while most of the submissions are self-posts

* Pure math is awesome

The first point is the hallmark of any good circlejerk: autocongratulation. Yes, but more interesting. They deserve their own presentation.


**The Greatest Common Divisor**

From the FAQ:

&gt; As the sidebar on the reddit says

This explains the predominance of low-level subjects: trigonometry, equations and curves, and low-level manipulation of complex numbers (Euler's identity) are favorites. I am not familiar with the American curriculum, but their common point is to be high-school or college freshman level. 

One of the features which distinguishes mathematics from the other sciences is that it is often extremely hard to explain research-level subjects to people who do not have already a very good grasp on the problem, and it is a good thing that people can speak of mathematics whatever their skills are. What distinguishes /r/math is the lack of awareness of this fact.

You can critic [/r/physics](http://fr.reddit.com/r/physics) all you want, etc. The folk in /r/math seems joyfully oblivious of the larger picture. I now present you two gold mines from two weeks ago (alas, they were worse at their beginning; they have been somewhat tamed):

[Your most hated topic in mathematics](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/) (+68)

You will learn that [topology](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rqjr8) (+41) is a whole area of mathematics, so they answer to what they have studied in class. And get upvoted, not because of the pertinence of their answer, but because many other people can share their experience. Their irrelevance is irrelevant.

To sum it up: a lot of people in /r/math is only familiar with the most basic tools of mathematics and the [high-school curriculum](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/12jzg2/what_is_this_image_missing/) (+171)

We could push the argument to show the existence of another kind of idol: not subjects or mathematical objects, it is harder to expose. You may start to be bored, and want something fresh to fuel your superiority complex. Thankfully, there is a ripe fruit, ready to be eaten. Here is the biggest circlejerk of them all.


**Holiness**

Let's begin with some context. A popular reductionnist view asserts a hierarchy of sciences. Mathematics is the most fundamental science, which is applied physics (molecules are only a bunch of atoms); then biology, which is applied chemistry (live beings are only a bunch of molecules)... Some people go as far as seing psychology as applied biology. Mathematics, being at the top of this metaphorical food chain, is obviously the best, right? Well, actually, mathematics done for the sake of mathematics (e.g. mathematical logic and algebra) - and *applied mathematics* - mathematics done for application in other (who said lesser?) domains (e.g. statistics). This dichotomy exists in the real world

My opinion is that it is mostly bullshit, and not necessary in any way for the following. Then point is that, on the one hand, you have universality of pure mathematics, done for the sake of mathematics, of beauty, or whatever you like; unbounded by our mundane, dusty, mingled with lesser sciences. Where does this leads us? In most isolated community built around a subject

Well

From the FAQ:

&gt; If you've felt frustrated by the way math is taught in k-12

Lockhart's Lament is a ten-year-old text which thoroughly critics the learning of mathematics in the United States - although the same could be said anywhere - and asks for mathematics to be taught as an art, and applications mere byproducts. You can support this opinion, reject it completely, or even find some kind of middle ground; the important part is that the only piece of opinion in the FAQ already chooses its side in the ""pure against applied"" battle. While I believe I've already seen Lockhart's Lament used for Karma benefit in /r/math, I am unable to find any good quote. However, if you wish so, you may track it into other subreddits. 

Now, the top answer is:

&gt; [I'm suprised nobody has mentioned number theory yet. It and its offsprings are something special.](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rsetk) (+69)

This is actually a good quality comment. However, frequently deals with prime numbers and problem which are easy to formulate (1 point), and on the side is one of the areas of election of Terrence Tao, one of the mathematician idols of the subreddit (1 point), for a grand total of three points. The following best comments also ride the pure mathematics train: [category theory](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rq1gn) (+44), [topology](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rqjr8), [abstract algebra](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rruya) (+33) (certainly because algebra alone does not sound abstract enough), [algebra again](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rrklj) (+22)

Today

The submission [Matador Justice](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zpouz/matador_justice_xpost_from_rpics/) (as of 9/11 at 7:05 pm PST) currently sits on top of the /r/JusticePorn Subbreddit's front page with 616 postive karma (1288▲/672▼). Lets go ahead and de-construct this perfect example of the /r/JusticePorn circlejerk.

**The Submission Itself:**

The thread started as [a cross post](http://fr.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zpaok/matador_justice_nsfl/) from /r/pics with the title ""Matador Justice"". After being cross-posted it quickly made it's way to the top of the /r/JusticePorn's front page by pandering to the braveness of the JUSTICE ERRY DAY circljerk crowd that inhabits /r/JusticePorn. The submission shows this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/WmZfd.jpg) of a spanish matador getting gored in a fight with a bull (video of said fight can be seen [here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=85b_1243583966)).

The circlejerkiness of this submission really comes from the subject matter of the post. Justice porn states in their rules:

&gt;Must include justice

Now you might ask yourself how a picture showing a Spanish Matador being gored by a bull is justice? The answer is that it is not. It is a tragedy from every (sane) perspective. The bull and the matador are both crippled in the fight. So how come this post currently sits on the top of the /r/JusticePorn frontpage? It is simple really. Reddit loves to hate (and upboat anything about) cruelty/the death of animals while they worship bacon, and many other meat products. Simple fact of the matter is that such things happen on this planet, why would it be justice if a person is gored along with the bull. Shouldn't it just be viewed as a tragedy on both parts? Even still these sort of posts continue to be upvoted by the mindless /r/JusticePorn circlejerk that worships the violent injuring between two beings.

**The Comments Within**^^^oh ^^^dat ^^^uber-circlejerk

Comments inside of the /r/JusticePorn subreddit tend to follow one of these simple

or

&gt; I HOPE THAT (person x) DIES/IS MUDRERED/IS GORED

or

&gt; I THINK THAT (person X) DESERVED TO BE SHOT DEAD! EVERYONE WHO MAY BE GRIEVING OVER (person x's) DEATH IS WRONG AND SHOULD FEEL BAD FOR FEELING BAD

or

Many people use these templates to their fullest extent by changing some of the words to seem even more vulger/revenge driven.

One thing that I do want to make clear is this: Yes there are many bad people being displayed inside of the /r/JusticePorn subreddit

The actual comments of this submission are just as HUMANS BAD

&gt; I know what we need to do. We need to breed a new kind of superbull, rinse, repeat.

**Yes bullfighting is a cruel sport.** **Yes the matador wounded the bull.** **Yes the entire sport is a barbaric display of cruelty.** Does that justify *you applauding the bull for causing a possibly deadly injury in the human?* Spanish matadors usually have a family history in the sport. It is their culture

Any attempt of course to break the circlejerk and say, as always comments following this idea are immediatly downvoted as seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zpouz/matador_justice_xpost_from_rpics/c66rq33) [\[also here\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zpouz/matador_justice_xpost_from_rpics/c66u7ty) [\[and here\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zpouz/matador_justice_xpost_from_rpics/c66tsom)

In the end of course we must realize that as long as /r/JusticePorn continues to provide:

&gt;A place to see bullies getting their comeuppance. JusticePorn is about justice being served to wrongdoers

This utterly Ego-boost/gut-decision driven circlejerk will continue to grow and spread. So let this be an example of the normal circlejerking that goes on in r/JusticePorn. Anyways

Welcome to /r/truereddit

&gt;The bike is the ideal form of personal transport

Cycling is perfect but because of those damn corporations there is nary a bicycle in America.  Another uses agrees with the main premise

&gt;Eh, elderly, children, etc), who do not need to carry significant loads. There's also a significant safety issue...not a major concern to me given my fondness for both bikes and motorcycles, but significant nonetheless even if all you do is plow into a bench.
In congested cities I'd love to see more support of walking and cycling (I complain about lack of sidewalks constantly)

Comment sitting at 15 up 14 down currently.  How dare you question the convenience of the bicycle!  

&gt;We bike in the rain or snow just fine here in the Netherlands

The Netherlands is well known for it's brutal winters.  Not wanting to show up sweaty to the office is no excuse either

&gt;I work in IT. I show up sweaty or sometimes even change shirts when I arrive. It works out fine. It doubles my commute time

What about population density?

&gt;Not exactly true
Friend lives there regularly cycles a distance to hop a train to get to work. So cycles 4km to get train 40km and then returns etc.
Anything 8 -15km one way and I would feel obliged to cycle it there. It is not about geography it is about culture. You don't see the same in many similarly sized cities around. Edinburgh

Doesn't matter.  Another uses is downvoted for arguing that cycling might not be the ideal choice for every person

&gt;Note: I'm not hating on Cycling
You can't drag several hundred pounds of food over 5-10 miles with a Bicycle.
Also hills are my demise. To get to work I have to go down an extremely steep hill (going to say its &gt; 45 degree incline) and up one of an equal incline.

One of the more annoying trends is for people to post about the location of the OP (submissions in /r/tattoos are required to say who did the work and where) and to announce their upvotes because of said location.

The other trend is just general off topic crap. The subreddit is for discussion of tattoos - critiquing work

The comment reply mentions how many people he knows smoke pot in spite of the fact they could have serious career consequences if they get caught. When talking about pot on reddit this is apparently a good thing.

&gt;I work in DC. Most of my coworkers have clearances

&gt;Half the people here smoke anyway.

This guy mentions how pot got him his STEM degree:

&gt;I attribute pot to one of the sole reasons I was able to wrap my mind around coding while going to college. Early in my freshman year, they started us off in Java -- yuck -- I think as some kind of torture).

&gt;A half-bowl later, and also gave me the gumption and balls to just say, ""fuck it, what if I do this?"" instead of stressing about the ""correct"" way to do something before writing a line, and, like magic, it worked.

This post is a bit further down but I'm gonna put it up towards the top because I enjoyed how it's true in more ways than the author intended.

&gt;I smoked daily for an entire decade. I want to smack anyone who makes broad generalizations about how the drug affects people. **A good reason the drug is still illegal is because of the idiotic evangelism**.

Liberty and freedom are only acceptable when they aren't abused, and since there's no consensus on what constitutes abuse I find that it is not only easier but actually preferable to strip freedoms and liberty away so long as the society is unified in its decision to treat everyone well and attempt to secure happiness and constant comfort for everyone.

Many of you are probably familiar with the zealous debate regarding the use of NSFW tags that flares up occasionally, there is fervent criticism against his novelty and subsequent warnings from fellow users that the only responsible thing to do is provide NSFW tag.

The OP, implying that he's already harboring doubts about the way he handled this situation and needs to seek approval and reassurance from the reddit community. 

Moving into the body of the posting, he will passively leave a word document discussing the issue open on his son's computer. He includes in his post the text of the word document.

The word document opens rather benignly, telling the son that he loves him and it's ok to look at porn, he did it too, etc. He does strangely seem to harp on the fact that visiting porn sites could cause viruses that would damage his son's ""1800 dollar computer"" , but whatever, he has already shown himself to be a passive parent and maybe he feels too awkward discussing the actual issue at hand. But then comes the bombshell when the father ACTUALLY LINKS HIS SON TO OTHER PORN SITES, claiming that they are ""better"" because they will not leave a virus on the computer: 

&gt;There are sites that are completely safe and you can go on them and not have your computer turned into a piece of junk. You can go to these sites and not screw up your computer. Don't click on any links taking you to other sites and please only go to these. Ninty percent of porn sites have crap that can brick a computer.
www.pornmd.com www.pornhub.com www.xvideos.com www.xhamster.com www.beeg.com

The OP then goes on to re-assure his son that he's done nothing wrong

Although I was shocked at the fact that any parent could be so irresponsible, wishing their own fathers had acted the same way and the like. 

For example,000 upvotes:

&gt;This is an awesome approach. When my dad caught me

While ""well at least we know you aren't gay"" isn't a good way to handle this situation

And below

&gt;Much better than my parents. I had printed off a risque pic of a lovely young lady that was simply breasts and hidden it under my bed temporarily. Took it to my cousins later amd he asked about the writing on the back. I'm like ""What writing?"" and there it is...... my mothers handwriting.... with the note asking simply... ""What would you tell Jesus if he returned while you were looking at this?"" Never mentioned it to her.........ever.

The comments go on

&gt;Nah

But no one seems to reprimand the father or suggest that he should have handled the situation in a different way. It just goes on and on with people telling him he handled the situation well. 

You have to switch over to the controversial comments just to find posts that don't blithely approve of the OP's handling of the situation. This comment, took exactly the right approach:

&gt;This is one of the worst displays of ""parenting"" I've ever seen. Are you proud of yourself? Proud of showing your son that being cool and buddy-buddy with your son is more important than your relationship with your wife? Proud of showing him that it's okay to lie to your significant other? Where do you draw the line in lying to the one you love? How does he know that? How is he to respect his mother as much as you, and you encourage him to visit those sites, with no sort of guidance whatsoever as to what he is going to see. Do you think it's appropriate for him to have those sort of images in his head when he's hanging around young high school girls? What do you think he's going to think of them, after being encouraged by his father to view videos of girls like them being degraded and cummed on and treated like animals? If I had a daughter, I certainly wouldn't want her around some kid who watches that sort of thing with not only his father's consent, but his father's encouragement! Your son isn't allowed to drink or smoke for a reason. His brain isn't fully developed yet. He can't handle those things without damaging its development. And here you are pushing this stuff on him without a word of advice on how badly women are portrayed in porn. You have done him a great disservice, and you should be ashamed of trying to be his friend when he needs you to be his dad.

One other comment

&gt;Also you just possibly commited a felony by providing pronographic material to a minor

Look, but posts like this make me wonder if it's becoming a full-on bastion of moral relativism. Nothing is wrong; everything is permitted; the only moral thing to do in any situation is accept what others are doing. OP has done a major disservice to his child, who, while still developing mentally and emotionally, now has explicit approval from his father to look at all manner of pornographic material, including the number of disturbing, degrading

I'm not naive enough to think that the OP can truly do anything to stop his on from looking at porn; most people do, or maybe it is just another signal of our society's slowly failing ability to decipher between right and wrong. If reddit's comments are any indication of the views of the younger generation, my generation, then I'm beginning to fear it's the latter.

For starters, while a large number of police are outside. They bust down his door and arrest him. There is no prior information provided, but there are other videos where he appears to have a history of police, intermixed with a whole lot of crazy. The guy is clearly unstable, all of his videos reflect this, as well as his subscriptions.

&gt;Here's a message he posted on another video

&gt;&gt;""Outside my door on 7/16/2012 I hear my 65 year old military veteran woman neighbor screaming for her life for help! I crack my door and her 300lbs 7' tall 45 year old boyfriend who's an x cop - was about to kill her. I cracked my door and he stepped right thru me and the door in one second flat. Punched me in my nose and monologued for 5 minutes. After he left I called 911 I and his girlfriend desperate for help! I had to make 4 separate calls to get help. When it arrived you see by the video I posted (hit more videos button) see the police and paramedics refuse to help me. I turned on my camera to document it. They are clear on film forcing me to shut off. As soon as camera went off a cop put me in cuffs behind my back and brutally up punched my guts. The paramedics laughed they never arrested the x cop for assault as I almost died. The dr's said my Internal bleeding was so bad I was minutes from death had I not reached their care at that very moment i would be dead on arrival as more then 2 of our 4 liters of blood in our body had seeped hemeraged into my abdominal area. Was about to die when reached dr's care. The police and paramedics almost killed me what some call a stupid hero for saving the neighbors by opening my door. Don't play a hero it will get you killed and no body cares about you not the paramedics not the cops not anyone. You have no recourse. I posted these videos and when came home from hospital was warned by the police to remove these videos or else. The very next day with my open wounds they invaded my home on film nearly killing me and had no warrant.

&gt;One night, if a good chunk of guys wanted, they could do whatever they wanted to you and you couldn't stop it. She disagreed, I said, ""we'll see"" and quickly grabbed her and pressed her against a wall. Since I had so much longer reach and much more strength I could hold her there no problem. Initially there was quite a bit of panic on her face, she clawed at my arm a bit and tried to kick but I just let her. After the moment of panic I just said, ""now imagine I wanted to hurt you.""

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/zvpab/how_google_fiber_is_trying_embarrass_the_cable/

Before starting: [here's some blantant karma-whoring](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/zvpab/how_google_fiber_is_trying_embarrass_the_cable/c685mge)

Here's my gripe about the thread as a whole. Gigabit fiber-to-the-home projects have existed for several years ([2004 - HongKong deployed 1Gbps FTTH](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/100Mbps-Symmetrical-4850-87851), [2011 - Sonic.net Announces $70/mo 1Gbps FTTH trials (with two phone lines and free calling)](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Sonic-Offers-1-Gbps-For-70-114594?nocomment=1). Gfiber hasn't even been deployed to a single home yet, and yet there's already all these projects out there that are being ignored. (by the way, there are some other small 1Gbps FTTH projects in the US, but I left quite a few of them out of this on purpose).

The common mantra at work here is that Google's project is going to ""shake up the ISP industry"". As you can see

Of course, into the bin it goes!

Still don't agree with me? Then why does their contract with the Kansas City Government explicitly include a clause allowing them to [exit the project within (or after

Ah yes, Google fiber is [not a free market success story](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Google-Fiber-the-Free-Market-Success-Story-That-Wasnt-121078). They got very, very lucky for Kansas City, and the model they used there isn't something that they'll be able to replicate anywhere else.

Now, they're still going to be paying a LOT of money for the infrastructure. There's a lot of figures floating around on this, ranging from $6k to $1500, but it's pretty fair to assume, given current technology and Google's sweetheart deal with Kansas City, we're looking at around $1500 (for combined passby and consumer hookup). You aren't going to be making much profit off of $70/month 1Gbps service, even if you're Google, how are they going to make the money? The common theory here is by monitoring internet use

One thing we DO know about 1Gbps is that it's pretty damn fast. Seeing as I have a dedicated server with a 1Gbps fiber line

http://speedtest.net/result/1960836609.png

http://speedtest.net/result/2059787466.png

It's worth noting that those servers are located in the same city as my dedi

http://www.speedtest.net/result/1908466130.png

This is just using basic hardware. i3-2100, Cogent, and Tata Communications). Not a very fancy or high quality bandwidth mix, and my gigabit line isn't dedicated bandwidth.

So

http://i.imgur.com/D5x9E.png

No

Okay

[930Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/KlwFs.jpg)

Pretty good, this should tell you a lot about what kind of ""test"" they're using). Let's see what a third-party like speedtest.net shows.

[319Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/WyAbS.jpg)

Further testing showed that [downloads are ratelimited to around 300Mbps each](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r27511430-Interesting.).

Now, but Google is supposed to be showing us what 1Gbps looks like. I know what 1Gbps looks like. And this is not it. This is some extremely clever throttling. And it's false advertising to advertise 1Gbps but make it impossible to download that fast, even from servers that support those speeds.

Now

The average web server is sitting on a 100Mbps or 1Gbps line. Some people use 10Gbps servers, which allows many clients to connect at a slower speed, instead of providing 1Gbps to a single user and nothing to everyone else.

What does this mean (in plain english)? Most servers cannot deliver content at 1Gbps.

Netflix limits itself to around 5.4Mbps. Back in 2011

Okay, etc? I'm going to go log into my dedicated server, and give you guys some piping hot &amp; fresh results from some popular sites.

Mediafire download: [2.8MB/s](http://i.imgur.com/iks3D.png) / [23.1Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/qsMDt.png)

Ouch. Not looking good at all so far. How about YouTube

YouTube (4K video): [6.8Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/iAKgh.png)

Now, usually around 20-30Mbps, and a possible burst of 70Mbps a month or two ago. However, my point is, YouTube isn't even showing speeds to me that would saturate a 100Mbps line. Not very impressive at all.

Of course

As you can see in the above screenshots, but didn't get a screenshot) at the peak. 

It is important to note that 8Mbps = 1MB/s. They are two separate units. Please don't confuse them. Also

What have we established so far with these speedtests? Most servers cannot serve up or receive at 1Gbps. If you have more servers you would like me to test to

After looking back at that all, but I'll wait and see if this is or isn't a good place. Anyways, here's why Google Fiber is a big deal and redditors are obsessing about nothing. Maybe somebody will find it informative, maybe this will explain why I feel so annoyed about the hype over something that doesn't deserve it. Is 1Gbps FTTH cool? Sure. Is it a service that's worth it? Probably not. Is it good that kansas city ISPs have competition? Yes. Is this going to change anything for other ISPs in the country? No.

Anyway this is where I add my two cents right? What's really upsetting me is that nobody in any of these threads, in the thread with the OP who was abused by his father and subsequently beat him up, people were congratulating him. **NO REDDIT, THAT IS NOT THE PROPER RESPONSE.** I appreciate that they're just trying to reach out to a fellow person but they should really be telling him to seek help; telling him that it's nothing to be ashamed of. Didn't we just have this talk about expanding mental health care to all individuals? Oh wait, that was just when people were threatening to take away your video games. Guess it's back to business as usual.

Recently, who tend to stick to older games, and when they do venture into newer games, they were never demos, and typically either games one (or both) really wanted to play, they were sent by fans, or continued a running ""theme"" (see: Kirby Return to Dreamland and Donkey Kong Country Returns.)

This

Of the two main jerks possible here (Screw EA! and a hipster variant “They used to be cool but then they sold out,000 subscribers) kicks in, and instead we see any and all opinions remotely negative toward the video downvoted, and downvoted hard while the “Our preferred entertainment venue can do no wrong” jerk kicks into full swing.

The number of posts saying anything *negative* about the video? Zero. 

Huh. Four separate posts to address opinions that seem to be entirely contained in comments (both YouTube and Reddit.) We’re in for a looooong ride

Might as well start with the post for the [video itself]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16m8s5/dead_space_3_game_grumps/).

&gt;That is some dang-ass hilarious bird animation. (180|16)


Ah
&gt;I'll probably be skipping any further ""Sponsored Grumps."" I'm all in favor of them making money, more power to them. I just probably won't watch those videos.

… huh? That seems entirely reasonable. What else have they downvoted here?
&gt;I feel uncomfortable watching this.
&gt;And don't tell me to get over it
&gt;I like this channel because how real it was (aside from some censoring)
&gt;It just makes me uncomfortable and I don't have fun watching. If you don't agree
&gt;In no way do I feel bitter or judgmental


Another reasonably expressed opinion that just happens to not be a fan of this direction of videos. Maybe all the downvotes are for the “downvotes to the left” comment.

And honestly? That’s… it. Those are the people angriest about the video. Maybe the other posts will reveal what everybody’s upset about.


[This]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16mu12/i_personally_loved_the_dead_space_episode_but/) post specifically asks for dissenting opnions, level-headed explanation of the problems they had with the video?

Oops, shall we? Get to the meat of it all.

Here’s one

&gt;Reposted from elsewhere

&gt;The major problem I see about this is that it erodes the sense of fan trust with the Grumps as a product. Up until this point it has essentially be a ride between us as the audience

&gt;Now, and is often seen as an unfeeling, profit-centric corporation. EA being EA, between their business practices and their history, are de facto ""enemies"" of most gamers, especially the ones most likely to watch something like Game Grumps.

&gt;This in itself sets a worrying precedence (and I would argue rightfully so), and more towards products we may not be. In effect, we don't want our advertising in our GG thankyouverymuch.

&gt;This would have been a lot more sensible if the game in question was something like an indie game. It would allow less well-advertised games to be seen by the general public (let's be honest

&gt;In short, but were it to continue we could see monthly corporate sponsored game playthroughs become the norm rather than the exception. GG would do much better to target smaller independents to highlight as it would achieve the same effect as this video without the harsh stigma of a conglomerate like EA looming over them.

Sitting buried some pages down at (38|19), personally, didn’t like the video. What’s voted above him, you ask? Lots, and lots of people praising the video, as well as people *guessing* at why other people might not like the video, THEN praising it.

The thing is? I’m having a REALLY hard time finding the opinions of people that *actually* had a problem with this video. I finally found another waaaaaaaay at the bottom of the comments
&gt;Because it felt fake and forced. (12|23)

-11 for that? For an opinion that is *actually relevant to the question that was asked*? And those are… it? What are the other two posts going on about then?

Alright

It’s a meme post

Let’s see what’s hidden due to downvotes.

&gt;Wuzzat? You liked the Dead Space episode?
&gt;People care about as much. (9|14)

Sarcastic, but it does nothing but flip the post’s point around. Doesn’t seem nearly as acceptable as not caring about people who dislike it.

&gt; What's that

The jerk doesn’t like being called out

I guess no one will be really surprised that a smaller, invited them to share their opinions, then ensured those opinions will never be seen by people who aren’t specifically looking for them.

&gt;Not allowing them to exercise their cultural and religious beliefs is racist. 

&gt;Don't you embrace multiculturalism anon?

&gt;Don't you embrace diversity?

&gt;I think all women should start wearing Burqas as a sign of solidarity with them. It really is offensive to their beliefs if you do not. Why would you intentionally offend them by not covering your head as a sign of respect? 

Yeah, right? It's basically the same thing as forcing your religion on other people and making them wear burkas, isn't it? The other comments in this thread are equally insightful: 

&gt;It warms my heart to see how r/worldnews is slowly becoming /pol/

Hurr durr everyone who calls out ignorance and racism is a brainwashed PC-idiot and has no right to have an own opinion. Yawn.    
Let's take a look at other comment threads:

&gt;They don't want to integrate with you
&gt;&gt;Of course they want us to integrate with them. That is what their whole religion, Judaism\) alike. The apologist will say that this is the ""minority"" that is doing it, which I would proceed in calling out their deception by asking, ""why haven't the ""majority"" spoken out against them?"" It is essentially giving silent consent to the more militant members. If it is a minority then why must they oppress their women and mutilate their female's genitalia (granted we still to this day perform circumcision)? Furthermore why must it always be immigrants from third world hellholes that do riots or think that they ""need"" (read:leech) welfare. They actively exploit Europe's more socialist governmental policies as a sort of career. In summation they need to integrate or get out of their respective host countries. [\(+70\)](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5nqqq)

&gt;Let's consider some of the brilliant work put forth by Gerolf Annemans (the visionary quoted by this article)

&gt;Vlaams Belang is a far-right conservative Flemish political party, and went so far as to explicitly question the validity of Anne Frank's Diary.

&gt;Now that Islamophobia has replaced anti-semitism as the fashionable form of European racism

&gt;As for Annemans' individual contributions: he co-wrote the so-called ""70 point plan""

&gt;""The Vlaams Blok indeed does not feel bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This UN-declaration was written together with people from Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire. Here in Borgerhout [sub-urb of Antwerp ]

&gt;All of this information is not disputed and is freely and readily available on Wikipedia

&gt;Let's just conclude this little PSA by noting how eerily similar some of the comments on this post (and more broadly in this sub and on Reddit) are to the comments made by Annemans and company regarding Muslims and Islam. Not to mention the fact that by linking to articles like this

An insightful comment providing context and background information as well as encouraging critical thinking will surely be upvoted by reddit's self-proclaimed scientists, while the smug reply [""Well these rioting muslim youths are not helping their cause""](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5myu) is always between (+10) and (+12). There are some other comments calling out the source of the article who aren't downvoted as badly ([here](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5ohcx) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5oy5r) for example), but according to RES they all have a very low upvote-to-downvote-ratio (eg. 9 upvotes, 7 downvotes) which implies that a lot of the islamophobes downvote any fact which doesn't fit in their worldview. The same thing happens to [redditors who point out](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5nqx6) that many others are ""blowing it [=the situation] out of proportion"" and that, in their opinion, the issue is more a socio-economic problem than a race/religion one. 

I'll end this post by quoting a few other le racist gems:

Whatever you may think about the world

And although many people will proudly proclaim that ""nothing is black and white

Both the Dorner case and the recent Tesla/NYT debacle are the two shiniest examples of this. I'm sure most of you have seen what I'm talking about.

Watching drama unfold and being intrigued is one thing - you are allowed to be interested in anything you want, pretty overblown).

But it is absolutely unfathomable to me why people - in this case

1. Invent 2 distinct sides.
2. Take a side.
3. Act indignant and righteous in favor of their side.

It's possible to read an article about an event without splitting the issue right down the middle. Isn't it? 

But even if these dichotomies were absolutely genuine, no professional or academic authority in, and usually no life experience regarding the issues at hand. Not every single issue in the world needs champions to defend it, and they definitely don't need Redditors to be those champions. Why is it impossible for Redditors to observe a situation without making gut decisions off a 3-second headline, brandishing their pitchforks, and then marching off to battle? In a website whose base is so proudly Atheist, why do they reduce the world into God vs. the Devil fictionalizations? 

I'm too tired to really get into this

[Here's an /r/bestof post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/18ipuq/cikedo_answers_an_eli5_about_the_dorner_case/) that tries to give credit to someone for ""breaking the issue down into the two sides, if you don't have one already.

As for the Tesla stuff... it's even worse, Musk does - whatever Brodan's interests are is unclear, although apparently he's a shill for Big Oil so there you go), and also because it's so borderline a non-issue anyway. Shit can happen without a hero and a villain being involved. Can't we at least wait for a neutral, after-the-fact arbiter to assess the information reliably and objectively before committing ourselves to a cause and fighting to the death for it?

&gt; Just a bit under a year ago the a good portion of the internet was migrating and boycotting Go Daddy ... due to Go Daddie's [sic] support of SOPA and it's later attempts to weasel out of taking responsibility for supporting it. 

&gt; What happened? Now Go Daddy is advertising on Reddit - I'm sure people are buying their service through the ads... WTF Reddit

Well

For example

&gt; ""[the ideal boycott for a company that doesn't bend over backwards to reverse some harmful effect ... is one that drives them out of business. That lesson isn't for them

In other words, you deserve to burn in hell. Why would they think this? Because Redditors are incaple of actual contrition.

&gt; ""[It's like when you were a kid and your parents made you apologize...you didn't meant it and only did it to keep out of trouble.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z2rhj/just_a_few_months_ago_reddit_was_boycotting_go/c610dst)""

No apology is ever real. Gosh, being Reddit this person might be serious):

So why does Reddit think boycotts should last forever? Might have something to do with not understanding the economy:

&gt; ""[It is not gains but losses that drives the economy forward. Gains are of course necessary as an incentive and because without gains

How can we make Redditors understand this concept? (Poorly) connect it to (bad) science

&gt; ""It's pretty much like evolution. Someone comes up with something and ""mutates"" their company. If that mutation sucks

And then a Redditor admit he's effectively boycotting Reddit. I bet he complained when the site went down yesterday:

Of all the things that reddit jerks off about, and all of the popular science/literature on infants parents are exposed to uses months instead of years."" That's really all there is to it. There is a *reason* for it, and it is a non-offensive and innocuous reason. 

(As an aside, then year-conventions must be equally arbitrary. The question isn't why do we age toddlers in months, but why do we age adults in years? If you answer ""Well, aging by year is a well-established social convention..."" then you are also defending the argument for aging by month. In other words... No matter how you go about it, the ""proper"" way to give an organism's age is a non-issue.)

So this should be an open-and-shut case. Once a single redditor steps out and explains, because that's how doctors and everyone does it, because important developments happen on a monthly or even weekly, not yearly, basis,"" everyone should either go, ""Okay, but I'm arbitrary so it's not your fault, everyone just repeats the same bone-headed objection

&gt;That pisses me off, they're fucking two.

&gt;&gt;It's because babies develop by the month

&gt;&gt;&gt;Great

Obnoxious comment. There's not really an answer to that,"" or maybe, ""yes,"" because what kind of issue is this anyway?

The next comment basically says, development is fast at that age."" But no, no matter how many times this simple, non-intrusive, universal explanation is given it, it just does not fall on receptive ears. Next reply:

&gt;Okay. But most people don't give a shit about all that and are just asking to be polite.

This is like when redditors complain about how horrible their facebook feeds are. If you're in a situation like this and you somehow don't like it, cultivate a different set of friends, and either take an interest in their daily activities or stop using facebook. In the case of baby ages, either don't ask in the first place, or do ask and understand the nature of the answer you will be given without getting pissed off about it. 

I just don't get the damn issue! It seems so adolescent! If you don't give a shit, then just give a shit! Fuck! 

After a point, like I said, there *is* a reason, and it's not whatever arbitrary STEM-lord schema you personally care to develop.

&gt;I hadn't really thought about why it was annoying until now. Clearly it's something that bothers a lot of people and I think might be why: It comes off as very self-absorbed. Not only do most people not care about the exact level of your kid's development

If someone asks you a question and you give a proper answer, I can't even understand what you are saying, what are ""months?"" Speak ENGLISH!

And then the bit about dividing by 12 being presumptuous? Come again? You don't divide by twelve - that's the point. ""22 months"" isn't meant to be divided by 12.

And now

&gt;If you don't care about the difference between 16 and 17 months, nod, and move on.

&gt;&gt;I like this train of posting. I went into this also thinking ""yeah it is so annoying when I get told that"" and after seeing this back and forth

Wasn't that refreshing?

Onto the bone-headed horde of childfree anti-breeder anti-month-convention coworkers!

&gt;""He's almost two"" ""He just turned one"" ""He's one and a half""
All acceptable alternative answers that are relevant to most people. We get that there are big differences per month for a kid

BLOOP BLOOP EXTRAPOLATE DATA FUCK NOT GIVEN (If: then: goto 0 lolol)

&gt;But a person asking just to be polite doesn't give a shit about the exact month.

Blah blah blah. Please

&gt;Why was your first calculation on a 2 year old ""Oral""?

When I read this comment a few hours ago, I guess, so back to the topic...

&gt;The whole question is pointless and a waste of time

FUCK YOU AND YOUR BABY

&gt;Those parents are just pretending to be interested so you'll talk to them about their crotch spawn

**DING DING DING**

&gt;The typical defense of parents is that there is a massive difference between a 24 month old and a 27 month old.
they fail to realize that no one actually gives a fuck

First child comment (475|111)
&gt;Because introduction to programming is not about programming as a job or even a hobby.
It is about getting a certain mindset to tackle problems in a efficent way.  
One could rather see it as applied logic and maths instead. It contains strict rules but it also grants a gratification if you follow those rules.    
Set up correctly
But in a day and age when schools basically competes for the attention of the kids it might not be a bad approach. And having some sort of formal early education on a thing that basically run the world by now is not bad either.

""Because it has the potential to help some understand math better

Further down

&gt;I don't envy the schools dilemma in teaching a child
Between physical puzzles
Now if there were themes/groups to have a child focus on as an option sure. Such as one group focusing on sports
But I still feel elementary schools should focus on the core first
Perhaps evolve the existing traditional classes to a more interactive logic/skill building than wrote memorizing from a book.  
I never liked how schools were often more about memorizing than natural/dynamic comprehension. Were applicable of course

Further down

&gt;No

I actually like this, especially the more algorithmic thinking behind it. Learning to analyze the information you have and what you need to find out in various situations has way more real-world applications compared to learning how to analyze it for use in code.

Moving on, analogy voicing why it seems unnecessary

&gt;Coding should not be taught in elementary schools. Your bias is showing. Coding is not essential. It's not a life skill.
Do you think we should be teaching automobile maintenance in elementary school? There are many

Obviously coding and auto repair are far from essential life skills
&gt;I have to disagree with you on this. I was taught coding in elementary (I'm 35), physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, etc. It's not a life skill, but it helps teach a building block for a number of things that are.

""What's good for me is good for everyone""
&gt; Then why not teach logic? Serious question.

way easier solution to this problem, or yet have to hire more workers in a floundering market

&gt;The point is that teaching something like LOGO is fun 

What's fun for me is fun for everyone!

&gt;This is like saying kids should be taught accounting so that they can learn to add. Just fucking teach them to add.

&gt;Though accounting is probably applicable to everyone's life

The perfect circlejerk had arrived and it possessed the 4 major hivemind sins. Women, and Sex. The battle was rough and at first the post had taken place at it's rightful spot on the top or /r/gaming. No single voice could muster up the strength to call out the OP with serious regard.

The first attempt begins as a [sly misogynistic remark](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lsugu) denying credibility because the OP is a woman. The first attack begins with the incredibility based upon gender. *Of course the pandering is obvious with gender*. Let us mock you for it. Yet this brave night was slain quick.

Soon enough


A shining knight approached and the silver sword of biting scientific commentary. A critical [(comment) strike cut deep](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lswro). The beast raised its head and spewed out a storm of *evolution* which scorched the thread into a nonsensical joke where no further discussion could grow. A garden that had been salted. A weak plant that had been snuffed out by the soot and chaos of inane joke comments.


The lizard had taken enough. No Champion could reason through the hivemind and yet the post still stood with high. Only one bitter knight could take them on. Only one with the experience to set this post to rest. 

[http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lup2l](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lup2l)


Finally a fighter worthy of making a criticizing comment. The only hope in making any real commentary. A challenger who's blade was as keen as their (s)word. The battle raged long and hard. The hivemind had once upvoted the post onto the front page and yet would only be swayed to kill it when actual criticism began. As always, and other easy low quality content. 

It had ended almost as abruptly as it has started

**Point of the day: Reddit constantly screams and cries at any hint of active moderation. This jerk is probably one of the most self-destructive ones I've seen on this website

Reddit has gotten really
  
Eh
  
It's the lack of moderation. Quick (semi-hyperbolic) comparison here:  
  
/r/askscience, and won, for the best moderation team of 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bestof2011/comments/pr4yd/congratulations_to_the_askscience_mod_team/). Could the quality of the subreddit be due to the moderators removing it from the default list? Maybe. But the quality has no doubt been maintained since I've been here (inb4 'only 7 months hurrrrrr'. I have like 7 accounts).  
  
Then we have our most loved subreddit
  
To be fair, the top moderator has [always](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9em07/a_note_from_the_creator_of_the_atheism_subreddit/) taken a laissez faire approach, and says that [it won't be changing any time soon](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rg164/moderator_message_updated_community_policy_for/).  
  
Anyway
  
Redditors have always encouraged behind-the-scenes leadership. In fact
  
Then you have the 'democracy' thing. There's some kind of widespread opinion that [reddit is a democracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s4sgd/have_the_official_owners_of_reddit_told/). Old thread
  
&gt;But that's why we have upvotes and downvotes! The community can moderate itself! We don't need censorship!  
  
Yeah
  
Wait a second
  
[Yeah
  
Oh... wait....  
  
[I forgot that they shortened it to no-mod week
  
Yeah
  
&gt;Lol
  
Uh-huh. So let's check out these other laissez faire subreddits.  
  
/r/pics: Shit 
  
/r/funny: Shit  
  
/r/politics: Shit  
  
/r/videos: Racist shit. [Constant](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=videos+racism&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on) racist drama
  

/r/gaming: Shit. However it is a very [self-aware piece](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zguzc/hear_me_out_before_raising_your_pitchforks_what/) of shit. But what do you think will come from that thread of anti-jerking? Oh yeah. Nothing. That was less than ten days ago and the front page of /r/gaming is currently macros, and 'DAE PLAY THIS?!'  
  
The userbase of the default subreddits is *too content* with their shit quality. They won't change unless they're made to by moderators-- and ooh boy! What happens when moderators moderate subjectively?  
  
Well
  
Reddit has a tendency to give ridiculous backlash when moderators make decisions they don't agree with. Most recent example is Overly-Attached-Girlfriend's AMA removal by /u/SupermanV2.  
  
[In case you missed it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztvyi/i_am_laina_aka_the_overly_attached_girlfriend_ama/c67o6f2)

[*Here's*](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zw1k7/what_i_imagine_supermanv2_looks_like_the_iama/) the mighty backlash by /r/AdviceAnimals.  
  
Has this been the first time?  
  
[Hah
  
[And this is quite older in comparison
  
[And just think of the shitstorm this little comment cause
  
Also
  
So not only is reddit aware that there's shit quality around here
  
Possibly my biggest issue with this is that moderators choose this, this ""you can't tell me what to do"" attitude spreads and infects. It becomes the 'norm' to not moderate based on quality, and subreddits that *do* get [chastized](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/dmpzr/the_moderators_of_rchristianity_actively_censor/) in the process with cries of 'le censorship!'  
  
Also, whatever happened here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDramaDrama/comments/zafff/recap_the_great_subredditdrama_banfest_and/)  
  

I guess I'm going to wrap this up now because I now realize that I've watched five episodes of DBZ in the process of writing this and I have no life.  
  
Healthy moderation is required for quality communities

I am at a complete loss for words here. These guys are jerking so hard in defense of weed that they just go ahead an assume a hell of a lot from the commenter's story. They assume that:

* the driver was not obviously high
* the police did not do any number of the tests that don't require a urine sample (crossed eyes, and there's actually a [saliva test](http://norml.org/legal/drug-testing/item/the-abcs-of-marijuana-and-drug-testing) that determines weed use in the past few hours).

* the driver did not have any weed on his person

Obviously, like work for example, you're an idiot. 

Let's ignore the sarcastic comments about /r/atheism subscribers sending prayers for the move to go well and get down to the nitty gritty. It starts with a person pointing out that maybe the Christians aren't being purposefully lazy and that they want their friends' move to go safely:

&gt; To play Devil's Advocate for a moment - pretend this was an Atheist couple posting a similar request
Granted, we're praying the meningitis away""). But there are also many times when it's simply a gesture of emotional support for others.
Now, whether these particular folks are being assholes or not in this case (any more than I would know in the Atheist version I gave). Are they actually unable to help, and expressing support anyways? Are they just not wanting to help out, and pretending to care to save face? Who knows. Either way, this really isn't a great example of how/why religion can be harmful (which, I assume, is the reason so many posts like this show up here), and if we really want to demonstrate to the world that ours is a better viewpoint to operate from

This man

&gt; The key difference is that praying Christians actually believe they are doing something, not from the lack of help itself. +110

Christians aren't humble, am. I am smarter than theists, I have more critical thinking skills than theists, and I am far more humble than theists. In reply:

They said they were going to pray for their friends

They are too lazy to even pray properly. Thank goodness we have a /r/atheism subscriber telling us this

This commenter tells a story about how he witnessed a freshman in his high school gym class get ganged up on by the popular athlete archetype kids. He found out later that the kid was beat up and sodomized with a ruler. Pretty dark stuff.

One commenter wonders how kids can think this is okay
&gt;Really immature + low IQ + thinking they're really mature = 90% of highschool.

This next comment tells a story about his experience with bullying.
&gt;But what if there really is no other way out?
I got beaten up daily after school for several years. I tried everything. I told everyone about it
But all they did was saying that it must have been my fault because I was cheeky

Sounds like this guy *might* have been using some fighting words.

&gt;I really haven't seen a way out of this and one day took a rusty metal rod that ways laying around and chased them away from me.
This was also the first time that the school intervened. By giving me detention.

My generation, the market for video games is much more vast. From your nerdiest neckbeard to your casual grandma, companies want to tap into that market which means they need to change. Which is something some gamers fail to grasp.

One of the biggest thing is DLC.There have been really good DLC (akin to expansion packs) and really bad DLC (horse armor). DLC stands for downloadable content so it's a broad concept. Well

&gt;Nowadays, the gaming landscape has changed, and, as the demographic of gamers has grown

Okay

&gt;Those were the glory days, before EVE Online and WoW had driven every other MMO to extinction


The glory days? ULTIMA ONLINE ANYONE?!?!? OP has nostalgia glasses on so hardcore that he's become stupid. First off, etc... I'm not even gonna go into the FPS bit because I'd get an aneurysm.

&gt; For, every bit of DLC is really just a fragment of content, that was rightfully ours anyway when we bought the game, taken away by the evil publishers so they can charge us extra, for far more than it's worth.

Actually, much less a hardcore gamer exactly because of people like OP. Triple A titles cost a lot of money to produce and the developer doesn't owe you shit. They didn't take anything away from you. To call publishers evil and demand content reeks of bullshit entitlement. My opinion as an barely informed consumer is that if DLC's werent an option. They wouldn't have been fucking made for you to buy because life lesson #1 no one is going to give you shit for free. If they do it's shitty no good.

&gt;And so I'd like to ask a question of you

Let's start calling black people niggers again because OP is too stupid to read a fucking description.

&gt;And, and whether I should be OK with spending $5, $10 or $20 on it.

There are reviews and stuff you can read. Stop being a lazy fuck and inform yourself.

Top comment has this line

&gt;DLC:Short

Refuses to acknowledge that DLC is a encompassing term and sees DLC as some boogey man term. Goes into the whole DLC BAD

Luckily someone mentions this

&gt;What is this? You won't get the full experience without it? Borderlands DLCs were $10 - you didn't need them to have the full experience with Borderlands.
Saints Row 3 DLCs were absolutely not necessary to have the full experience.
DX:HR - full game without any DLC
Skyrim's Hearthfire - DLC
Skyrim's Dawngaurd - DLC
Assuming that all DLC is ripped from the full game is foolish.

Much like how old people want to legislate to benefit them or fuck the young people in the ass. Let's make publishers follow a rule of what is an expansion pack.

&gt;The problem is that publishers might actually start using it

Big companies don't give a fuck. We're moving towards a world of megacorps and a dystopian world. Enough people don't give a shit that it's gonna happen.

It's pure, awesome, voltron-esque mega-jerk wherein entire swaths of modern cultures are dismissed offhand.

Top comment...

&gt;The ones I hate the most are when they take a common name and spell it wrong.
Edit: TIL there are even more fucked up names than I thought... the world is doomed.
Edit2: I would also like to say that I try not to immediately judge people on their misspelled names... especially if they know I'll have to type it in and they go ahead and give me fair warning that's it's a weird spelling. If I spend a week trying to find a Michael in the company directory that ends up being spelled Mykel

I like this series of backpedalling, ""No, I try not to be immediately judge people... That said, I do immediately assume they were raised by absolute idiots."" So progressive, bro.

Blah blah blah...

&gt;Why do people seem unable to notice when they're in the middle of a fad? That any significant deviation from generally accepted styles and tastes will

Because naming every white American ""Bob"" and ""Bill"" for an entire generation isn't a ""fad"" of its own - it's just ""generally accepted style and taste, are universally true and eternal and unchanging. What about the ""Britneys"" and ""Jasons"" of the 90's? (Courtesy Hercules^TM for that one)

On a different note

&gt;My son's name is Anders. In all honesty, but it seems to be quite an every day name in Scandinavia. People always think his name is ""Andreas"" and just can't get down his name even though I think it looks fairly obvious. I hope I didn't make a terrible mistake. : /

Reddit *rushes* to this person's aid, decent, civilized name - there's a character in a popular workplace comedy named ""Anders,"" after all! It MUST be normal!

EDIT 2: Switching killed for euthanized

Now by his own admission, but involuntary euthanasia is rather, well, illegal. There's a good reason for that, which is basically the fact that it's murder. However, our friend Mr. Genetics want to show us his that he *feels* bad about murdering people with this comment:

&gt; [Right? I feel terrible about it

Oh well, if you feel terrible about committing murder, **Why are you trying to commit murder?** Is it because you have an unchecked superiority complex and haven't gone outside to realize that you're not really that intelligent, and that looking down on people you claim are mentally inferior is wrong? Or is it because you hate disabled people? Do you think them subhuman? Are you that selfish? Do you really think that that's the kind of mindset that you should occupy your time with? Or is it both reasons? Are you the kind of person who, if given the chance, would sign legislation into law with the intent of mass genocide?

&gt; [I know. I doubt if I would support it if it were proposed as legislation, but it's still my opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8ycz0j)

I think that we should kill all jews, before I move on the next enlightened quote, I want to delve into every reason why this quote is insane. This guy claims he wouldn't support involuntary euthanasia if it were proposed as legislation. Why? Well, because of the ethical issues of course. Well that's good to know. Because I would like to know why you think that eugenics on the mentally ill is a good idea if you think murder is so immoral? Did you purposely forget to fill us in? But then he gives us two interesting words to contemplate: ""I doubt."" As in, he doubts that he would support legislated **MURDER.** As in, he could be persuaded into making it happen, in that he still has conflicted feelings about killing people. Well

&gt; [As a genetics major
We as a species are severely inbred and unhealthy, people seem to often be more concerned with keeping functionally below-normal level people alive in 1st world counties much more so than helping all the people in 3rd world countries, I think people's priorities are seriously off here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yf10m)

A eugenics major with 10 upvotes. Well

&gt; In the ""wild"" so many people would have been killed off by natural selection already but because of better medical treatments and societal tolerance for mental handicaps such people are still alive and breeding.

There are so many things wrong with that statement I don't even want to go into it. I can't even believe I just read that. He goes on to say that the genes of the mentally handicapped are poisoning the gene pool and making our race suffer. I don't even know what to say to that. 

&gt; We have a serious over population issue and yet were saving people that aren't contributing to the species in any way. 

It's frankly ludicrous that this hasn't been downvoted to oblivion. Forget my original question, we all have people we depend on, and people who depend on us. It's not about mental handicaps, it's having some f*cking human empathy! This isn't funny! 

&gt; [I believed euthanized is the word you're looking for. Though the action and result are probably the same, but ""euthanized"" shows you believe they're suffering too much and should be given a chance to end the suffering.

**WHY DON'T THESE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THEY ARE BOTH MURDER?** There isn't some difference between what the two words mean! Involuntary euthanasia is murder! There is no difference? End of discussion! How can you even be in the same room with a person who thinks that killing disabled people is a good idea? 

&gt; [I'm actually totally for it too. In the back of my mind. I know. That mean blah blah. No, i'd abort it. My uncle is a paranoid schizophrenic and I've seen what it does to the whole family. No, I won't put my family through that or myself.

How can anyone be this arrogant? Is that baby somehow unworthy of living? Do you have preconceived standard of intelligence that you think justifies infanticide because you think it below you? Are you insane?

&gt; [Having a brother who is mentally ill beyond repair

Okay, being a parent is hard. It's difficult, sometimes it can even make you wonder why you ever decided to have kids. Raising a disabled kid is even tougher. But you should never **EVER** let that justify murder. If you do, then you are even more mentally incapacitated then your brother ever was!

&gt; [I think eugenics is the answer. You should have a licence to breed

**THIS. HAS. TO. STOP.** Can you imagine if people were ever forcibly sterilized? Do you think you would like it too? Do you think that you're going to be the one that is so enlightened that the U.S. government will just hand you a list of names and ask who gets a permit? How much of a deluded monster can you be?

&gt; [I'll bite.
It's the same reason some people chose to take their own lives instead of living out the rest of their lives bed-ridden or hooked up to some machine. The quality of life for people with debilitating mental disorders is very, but they sadly can't, because they have to take care of their child. And I know they'd say ""We wouldn't trade him/her for the world"", but I bet deep down, they do wish they had full lives without their autistic child.
There's also the whole ""they don't contribute to society"" aspect of it. There are people with disabilities working and living and participating in society as a whole, and that puts a burden on their families or whoever is taking care of them.
I'm pretty sure that's everything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yf083)

Yes, and you still do everything to make sure that they have the chance to be the best that they can be. And even if they never contribute to society, you should never think about how nice it would be if they were aborted or whatever. They're your kid, and if you had one you would understand.

Finally

&gt; [I never said I was disgusted by the mentally handicapped. If anything, I treat them like I would anyone else, because they're still human and they can't help or be held responsible for their condition. My feelings on this subject are based completely on the effect their condition has on those who are forced to support them for their entire lives.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yfnqb)

This is the definition of a dictatorship: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator

""A dictator is a ruler (e.g. absolutist or autocratic) who assumes sole and absolute power (sometimes, as in an absolute monarch.""

So according to Reddit

* The rich have a lot of wealth (OMG 1% OCCUPY!!!!)

* The rich are given tax cuts (which has nothing to do with being a dictatorship!!!). I don't even care if you believe that the rich should pay more taxes. It is stupid to think that just because they pay less taxes

* Companies are bailed out (WHO CARES if the wall street dies and millions of people lose their jobs? Bailouts are BAD!!!)

* The media is secretly controlled by one person (sounds like /r/conspiracy lol)

* The media forces people to supports policies that are against their interests (LOL AMERIKKKANS ARE ALL BRAINWASHED BY MSM, marijuanacurescancer.com)

* Wiretaps

* Certain racial groups go to prison (this one is really stupid. The US isn't actively suppressing a certain race!)

* Rigged elections (Depending on your opinion

In the end

I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS! If you have an opinion about which policies are good and bad

Some people may wonder: Why do dictators get such a bad rap from others?

Probably because some modern dictators haven't done many good things lately:

As you can see, and (again) only suited for [teenagers and old people](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jj1pz). Further down, we have people calling Apple [fascists](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jie46), and people attacking the iPad for not being able to load [custom code](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jik6n), possibly the geekiest thing imaginable, and people attacking the iPad for not having [standardized processor architecture](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jilf0).

Around the same time

[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bmnwq/ipad_users_have_you_noticed_these_problems_i/) talks about a list of problems with the iPad that was published on Yahoo News soon after the iPad's release (the article has since been deleted.) We've got pretty much the same jerk going on here. There's people waiting for the iPad sales to [crash and burn](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bmnwq/ipad_users_have_you_noticed_these_problems_i/c0njf8l) (and when someone points out that it's been selling well

Anyway

The overwhelming negative reaction to the iPad is a good example of how wrong tech geeks can be about tech not aimed at them. This is one of the driving forces behind the anti-Apple jerk, or it's lack of RAM, they care about very different things - which Apple understands, and is why Apple is currently [the largest company on Earth, by market capitalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012).

A similar attitude is found in the anti-casual gaming jerk (go to any Reddit thread about Farmville, or that they're going to fail. I suspect it ties to Reddit's entitlement, and also to the weird obsession they have with things that aren't aimed at them (Justin Beiber, Twilight, Farmville, etc.)

Let's not forget a politicaljerk.

&gt; ""Liking"" or ""sharing"" something on Facebook and feeling like you are actually helping or proving anything.

**(+280

&gt; Microtransactions with video games. Especially to get stuff that isn't just cosmetic.

**(+338, though, even if you can get something nice in return. 

So what if someone actually likes a trend that Reddit hates

&gt; Reality TV, simply because we know they're fake and watch it for hilarity's sake.

**(+288


It's been at least 3 comments since we complained about Facebook and Twitter...
&gt; Hashtags. Hashtags everywhere.

**(+341, is convenient to use, is understandable, and ubiquitous is a terrible fad. #FireFly #NathanFillion #Browncoats

 Every novelty account you can think of is coming out of the woodwork and making stupid jokes based on their account. The entire thread has erupted into a novelty account jerkfest and Reddit celebrity gossip party. Karmanaut is the only one who gives a serious answer to the OP's question:

Now, they can all be summed up as ""Well, it is a show for stupid people who like to make fun of smart people"". Literally, search for any thread about TBBT and you will find people making this argument again and again.

Now, that is completely valid.

What I am here to do is express my annoyance that these shitty arguments keep on getting upvoted again and again. Not only upvoted

So

&gt;[ [community]Toribor explains why so many redditors hate The Big Bang Theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1645o2/toribor_explains_why_so_many_redditors_hate_the/)

I guess I shouldn't be surprised - this /u/Toribor guy is validating an opinion held by the hivemind on a subreddit (/r/community) dedicated to another television comedy that Redditors love. Of course he will get upvotes. But /r/bestof? Really? Well

&gt; Because the show isn't for nerds

Yes

&gt; All of the humor in the show relies on Sheldon being socially incompetent and just saying random things like ""That's crazier than trying to play battletoads!"" or ""That reminds me of my N64!"" or ""Blah blah something something Battlestar Gallactica!""

*All* of the humor? OK, but from what I have seen, that is far form ""*all* of the humor"". Also, while look-how-inept-Sheldon-is jokes are common, most of them involve Sheldon referencing some random scientific theory/law/whatnot, not simple references to Battlestar Galactica.

&gt; I love Community and I love Arrested Development.

Like I said

&gt; They are smart shows about dumb people

And we get back to the elitism. TBBT is a dumb show

&gt; Ask yourself

Leonard. I've only seen a few episodes

&gt; The answer is Penny

No it's not. Penny is a protagonist, which is why the first season is basically Leonard chasing Penny and finally succeeding.

&gt; In short, and it has a god-awful laugh track.

I hate the laugh track, plenty of the references are actually pretty intelligent - they talk about legitimate scientific theories quite a bit.

&gt; And I don't think that the people who do like it are idiots. I just wanted to explain that TBBT is a low-brow formulaic sitcom. Everyone has at least one shitty show like this that they enjoy. I just hate when it's hailed as better comedy than some other truly great shows out there.

I do truly believe that /u/Toribor doesn't hate people who like TBBT. Nevertheless

Now, I would excuse the fact that it got on /r/bestof. But it isn't. This argument has been made over and over again. Seriously, just glance through [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/o0zou/aka_every_episode_of_the_big_bang_theory/) - which also contains some light-hearted racism - [or through this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/100liq/what_are_movies_or_tv_shows_you_find_painfully/c69cd7x).

That being said, I actually agree with this sentiment. However, no one (that I remember) was actually *defending* what bin Laden did. More disgusting, even, are the various bouts of Hitler apologies that I'm sure my fellow CBers are aware of. What sickens me is that this guy was neither a terrorist nor a genocidal maniac.

You can see reddit dislikes this kid but I'm not sure I used the greatest method to show it. I wanted to stick with picking out the top comments rather than handpicking the worst ones. I do believe this was a fair approach.

If you would like to see the hatejerk in full form take a trip to some comment sections on threads created around the release of ""After Earth"". I seem to recall that was the height of the hate-frenzy.

reddit has always been particularly vocal in their dislike for Apple, as well, and especially so during and after his passing - the brave, counter-culture redditors had the courage to stand up and vocally protest Apple and Jobs when the media and others were mourning his passing.  
  
Particularly amusing is the ability of redditors to deny that Jobs accomplished much of anything at all, to name a few.  
  
Let's take a look at some choice excerpts:  
  
&amp;nbsp;

*[dazonic 68 points 4 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z04uo/til_when_steve_jobs_accused_bill_gates_of/c60ek1h)*
&gt;You're wrong

&gt;He [built a frequency counter](http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/09/12-year-old-steve-jobs-meets-bill.html) when he was 12.

&gt;He knew object-oriented programming was the future and needed to be the foundation of future operating systems as soon as he learned about it

&gt;Eric Schmidt on Steve:

&gt;&gt; He was so passionate about object-oriented programming. He had this extraordinary depth. I have a PhD in this area
I should tell you this story. We’re in a meeting at NeXT, and he comes back out to argue with us some more. It was over a technical issue involving Objective C, a computer language. Why he would care about this was beyond me. I’ve never seen that kind of passion.

&gt;Eric Schmidt talks about this very argument in [this interview after Steve's death](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/77067952-google-s-schmidt-says-jobs-merged-art-science.html) (I believe the above quote is from here as well). He says something like:

&gt; Many people see Steve as a marketer and salesman and think he wasn't technically minded but this isn't true at all

&gt;In [This 70min video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnO7D5UaDig) he talks about many programming technologies at Apple

So the two-line comment which makes a false claim discrediting Jobs (and therefore in-line with reddit's desired notions) has nearly double the karma of a factual comment which corrects this falsehood and manages to provide a number of sources to back up that claim. Phenomenal.

&gt;You say that as if there weren't a hundred other companies with MP3 players out before the iPod. The iPod wasn't even a good MP3 player. It was kind of a piece of shit compared to some of the ones coming out of big Japanese companies. It was the influence of the media and celebrities that made the iPod as popular as it was. I doubt anyone envisioned it happening like that. Plus Wozniak.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Turns out that running a multi-billion dollar technology corporation doesn't require any technical inclination or skill. Jobs was just a hack fortunate enough to know reddit's beloved Woz:

&gt;&gt; I would bet everything I own that Bill spent more time programming than Steve Jobs ever did.

&gt;Well you'd be right

&gt;It amazes me in 2012 that people think Steve Jobs was an engineer or anyway technical

Here we learn that Jobs owes all of his success to Gates

&gt;Because it's not true.

When many people think of modern communism, the good intentions are there, and with some of these people you can usually stir up some intersting and productive debates, depening on who you talk with.  Let me assure you, /r/communism is *nothing* like that.  To get a better feel for what /r/communism is, we can start with this lovely piece of their [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/v1293/rcommunism_rules_and_guidelines_for_posting/) (the whole of which is entertaining):

&gt;This forum is for all Marxist communists. This includes those who identify as Marxist, Trotskyist, Stalinist, Hoxhaist, Maoist, and probably other less common lines.

B-b-b-but that has to be a formality, no shortage of Stalin ones either!

So how far down does the ~~rabbit~~ shit hole go?  Let's find out!  First

But that's the easy part, and they manage to pull it off!

[Freedom of speech is opression!](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/wuq8f/since_communism_doesnt_support_freedom_of_speech/)

[We need to arm only the WORKING class](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/wuaq1/help_me_develop_my_understanding_communism_gun/c5gk8ev).   Reads like bad 19th century propaganda.

[Reading is sooo uncool

[Marxism=Science!](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/wrmcz/what_is_the_marxian_science/)
Sound familiar?  For those who don't know, to make a science out of human history and behavior.  With his awful tools at his disposal, he arrived at the Kant-ian conclusion of a ""natural progression of history"", a sort of Teleology that is remixed to be compatible with materialism.  Naturally, that ""natual progression"" always ends in worldwide communism.  This is played a great role in making communist regimes inflexible.  Here's a choice quote out of that shitpile:

&gt;Why shouldn’t marxism be a science? It would be entirely metaphysical to draw a line between the evolution of human social organization and the evolution of human anatomy or behaviour

Apparently the principles behind genetic transfer are just as capable of explaining all of human behavior.  This is why you get sent to the Gulag for being against the state apparatus

[Fuckin Trotskyists and their baseless attacks on North Korea!](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/wot6k/propaganda_a_dprk_film_showcasing_the_american_lie/c5fc7cx).

&gt;CheFiegel's willful blindness of the DPRK's failure is pretty embarassing, Education, economic growth, industrialization"", which you say constitutes the category of ""EVERYTHING"" that matters.

Next he'll be using nebulous and abstract terms such as ""food"", an absolutely elaborate, insane defense of North Korea.  Worth reading to see how insane people truly are.

####Meta Policy  
  
The only real change made to the rules was that the ""Meta"" rule was clarified for submissions
  
&gt;* Discussion and criticism of CB belongs in /r/CirclebrokeDiscussion unless it suggests specific changes that can be implemented by the community or moderators.  
  
Under this rule

In short, try and come up with a way to fix it.  
    
####Discuss the Discussion  
  
When commenting
  
&gt;* We ask that comments discuss reddit instead of the topic of reddit's discussion.

&gt;She actually describes a pretty easy

&gt;Many of us are fortunate enough to not have to deal with true hardship. The entitlement mentality we've developed makes it hard to see that.

Yup

&gt;It's interesting how it's all about perspective. She might think she has nothing right now

This isn't the worst of the bunch but its just feeding in to the idea that because she's attractive

&gt;I hate these ""draw my life"" videos. They are overly dramatic and way too exagerated. You are making money off youtube videos, stop this shit.

I don't think this guy actually watched the video because she wasn't being dramatic in the slightest.

&gt;She herself didn't say anything about having hardship or that her life was sad. She mentioned in the description that it turned out sadder than she'd expected

We could talk about how shitty the subs are; how inherently negative the community is and how shitty hands-off moderation can foster it; how it's basically aimed toward making fun of people for the decisions they make or the way they portray themselves; how the comment sections just turn into a smug circlejerk over the *~-.-xXxcringeynessxXx-.-~* and inferiority of ""autistics""; how the cringe reddits are the perfect example of the destruction of a community by cross-linking from bestof/SRD/whatever; how the userbase has a strong disposition against feminists/LGBT/friendzone/whatever; how /r/cringe's inherent flaw is that the users can go directly to the Youtube pages of the people involved and tell them to commit suicide; how I'm probably just railing against kids bullying kids; and so on

First I'll point out a common trend within the /r/cringepics reddit specifically: The comment sections of the posts usually devolve into text that was used in the pictures themselves. Some examples on the first page:

* [Link 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/18jviw/guy_lacking_social_skills_tries_his_luck_on/) Literally every god damn comment was text that was used in the post. Every comment. Literally. I'm not joking. The post netted 1500. All threads derailed into the word ""why"". I just want to hammer down the point that every fucking comment in this thread has no meat or wit to it. They're just using the text from the post as ""funny"" comments. Just saying.

* [Link 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/18j92r/meet_ahmed_angel_the_king_of_cringe/) which of course was sitting on the throne of my front page last night with over 2300 points. The reply to the top comment is text from the photos. The 2nd top comment at 1000 points is text from the photos. The 3rd thread starting at 700 points is text from the photos. The 4th thread is derailed by text from the photos. There's probably more but I didn't go down that far

* [Link 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/18jgt2/friend_zone_level_dumbass/) Post is at 1400. Top comment at 430 points is the -- seriously here -- second of only two sentences contained in the post. Meaning there are two sentences in the FB screenshot. One of them was used as a comment. That comment sits at the top.

And as long as we're talking about the cringe subs, politics, tech, etc. but to a specific areligion) is a default, can other popular subs that have a rapidly growing userbase and posts that continuously net 1K+ become defaults? And if these posts (specifically designed to make fun of people using the subscriber home field advantage) are showing up on /r/all and getting upvoted to Saganspace, what does that say about the innate hubris or bullying tendencies of the users?

&gt;$100 dollar fine for stealing a blu-ray worth 20-50 bucks

&gt;A $5000 dollar max fine actually benefits those downloading. It essentially guarantees that it will be more expensive for the companies to go through litigation than they can earn from the lawsuit. They would be suing the individual to a point of bankrupting themselves if they went after everyone. And those who are set an example of have to pay out a non-life destroying sum.

&gt;As a Canadian who downloads content I have to say I am very happy about this news!

The law is reasonable because now it won't be possible to litigate.

~~When I first joined Reddit, it's never really appealed to me. I ate a pot brownie once and was high for nine hours; never again. However, I respect one's decision to put whatever they want in their body. HOWEVER, if there was ever a sub to make me change my mind about that concept, it would be /r/trees.

In browsing /r/all today

Now the students want to organize and protest the zero-tolerance policy that the university has on possession of illegal drugs. Now that's fine and dandy. However, seeing unapproved material being posted on it's property (well within its rights to do so), removed the offending items. 

/r/trees has proceeded to go apeshit

From the post

&gt;Several eye witnesses have confirmed that campus police are systematically removing all posters and fliers which call for organization or try to set up a meeting. Police are also actively ""trying to figure out who is putting them up"". This has to stop. They have every right to enforce marijuana prohibition

1) Eye witnesses
2) So the police are trying to find who put them up, you can't put these up without permission"".  
3) NOBODY IS STIFLING YOUR FREE SPEECH

The top comment is a voice of reason

&gt;This confuses me. Even if weed were legal in your state wouldn't the University still have a zero tolerance policy? Campus is University property

&gt;They still have the right to assemble and attempt to ask for a reform.

&gt;Perhaps off campus

&gt;I've honestly never heard of a poster not getting approval in my 4 years here. Including fliers for protests against the university and recently a bdsm/bondage club that wanted to meet (on campus) and explore fantasies. Those posters were up for weeks without being taken down

I was extremely impresses that I didn't have to dig for something like this in a default sub

&gt;UA is a state funded university so I believe that you can hang posters anywhere that posters are normally allowed as it is considered public property. +6

&gt;Might be ""University properties"" but every student there is paying to be their with THEIR money. The colleges run on those kids money. (I understand they receive donations and what not but still) It not high school

I pay you to go here

&gt;Just because the campus has a zero tolerance policy doesn't mean they have to be dicks. +4

Tearing down posters = literally the next Kent State

My answer to this is technology. Use things like Facebook, so you don't have to worry about things like this. Alternatively, read your school's code of conduct or student's rights and responsibilities before jumping to conclusions about the police state coming to your university.

Top comment

&gt; In Germany

High level comment

&gt; I don't really care about helmet hair, heavy, and restrict head movement / visibility. It takes the 'fun' out of biking.
Plus there's no good way of dealing with the helmet when you get to your destination. You can't roll it up and put it in your pocket
I mean, but I was on the fence about biking anyway. This just gives me a reason not to.
On the other hand, and made of a different material with a helmet. It might also change the psychology of falling (I need to protect my head less and my elbows more...), plus helmets are designed to break after they hit something.

Below the anecdata, it's all the same. 

&gt; I agree. I'm getting tired of the government telling me what I can and can't do with my own body. I know the risks. If I want to risk my life on a bike

But what about reddit's greatest fear

&gt; Depending on your injury
What about if you fall and suffer head trauma to the point you are now in a vegetative state? Now you are a drain on the hospital system and the taxpayer system because you decided to not wear a helmet. (+11/-4) [link](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/199pu7/effects_of_bicycle_helmet_laws_on_childrens/c8m5qco)

And...

&gt; I'm with you...except that injured uninsured cyclists impose a burden on society. Also
I'm pretty ok with saying to adults: ""You skipped the helmet AND you're uninsured? You are an organ donor.""
""b-b-b-b-b-b-u-t it's just a little road rash!"" (+11/-3) [link](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/199pu7/effects_of_bicycle_helmet_laws_on_childrens/c8m59kg)

It's an egregious thread because it completely fails to engage with the source material

* In my country we do it this way

* Anecdata being presented and upvoted as if it is completely relevant. Getting off topic is totally fine

* People who make any kind of choice that I don't agree with are burdening me with their medical costs. 

* Why won't the government just let me be free?

* Kids these days are lazy and useless.

So, the place where memes go to be tortured for all eternity.

It's a hive of the same old tedious jokes, ""Lori's a whore"", ""This guy says this phrase a lot"", ""We have a major problem with women"", ""This kid runs away a lot"", ""Lori's a fucking bitch"". But there's one in particular that /r/thewalkingdead are just big big fans of.

See, is a character who rarely gets any lines. For the first two series, he was basically one step up from a background character. And /r/thewalkingdead made good use of that. They took a stand, and they showed that they were much more racially-concious than the writers of the show, by... *never ever shutting the fuck up about the fact that T-Dog is black*.

What gets me about ironic racism on Reddit is this: if ironic racism, 'jokingly' saying they're an absent father and probably belong in prison, is something you do literally every time the topic turns to black people, or a black person appears on screen, you are not being ironically racist. You are *just a racist*.

And that's where it gets me.

I know what you're thinking. 'It's just a joke, /r/thewalking dead *has* to force it into a 'LOL IRONIC BLACK PEOPLE JOKE IRONICALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'? Huh? Man, it's almost as if they can't see a black character without immediately resorting to racist jokes they then hide behind a cowardly curtain of irony.

ALMOST.

The writers of The Walking Dead didn't write T-Dog very well. He could be said to be the definition of a token black character. Had very little personality, he took a moral stand against Rick's bullshit, toughened up, and sacrificed himself to save the others. Meanwhile, one of the newer characters, who just happens to be black (**SHOCK HORROR**), is in a conflict with Rick, potentially cementing him a place in the group. Some nicely written storylines, by HAHA BLACK PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALS AND DON'TY NEED NO MAN AND LOL TOKEN BLACK MAN AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

If you're not familiar with the song that has been turned into a karma train here, content-free circlejerk.

What makes it content-free

1) There is no joke or humor here. When people post random overused quotes from movies or TV shows or whatever it's normally at least supposed to be funny. This is nothing. It's the words to the fucking song and that's it.

2) If you know the name of this song then *you can look up the words to it in two fucking seconds.* You could substitute literally that entire comment tree for [the number one fucking Google search result for ""flobots handlebars lyrics.""](http://www.lyricsmania.com/handlebars_lyrics_flobots_the.html) There is just no point - NO FUCKING POINT AT ALL - to posting the entire song's lyrics one comment at a time like this.

3) In this particular case I don't even understand how the top comment in this comment tree is relevant to the thread. What the fuck. It's like it doesn't even matter if the comment or reference is meaningful in the context of the thread

This kind of ""post song lyrics, with the first post being mildly clever at best and each subsequent parody verse/line getting increasingly forced and awkward. I hate that version of the song lyrics jerk too, but at least I can sort of understand why somebody else might find it funny.

But this comment tree? There's nothing to get. There's no joke. There's no interesting or meaningful information conveyed by it. It is ""DAE know this song?"" and that's it. And it's got dozens of fucking comments. This is probably the greatest example of derailing a potentially interesting thread for a pointless circlejerk that I have ever seen.

My favorite part? Ctrl + F ""a comic book"" - 72 results. **72 fucking people posted the exact same fucking song lyric. I think that's all I need to say about how fucking worthless this comment tree,,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,True

The first post, because generally if there's one thing the average person on Reddit seems to detest more than jerking is everyone who comes to complain about the jerking, which I find wholly understandable. This is a post that concluded rather sternly with:

&gt;So in closing-

Momentary break: For all that many people despise WarPhalange

&gt;Hi. You guys remember me? Remember how I said all of this a while ago and you just got angry at me? Not a damn thing has changed since then.

I'm quite confident that this stunt made him the most RES-tagged person on the website.

----

Now, allegedly stating that he would rather have Valve disintegrate than be bought by EA](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/znna7/gaben_id_rather_see_valve_disintegrate_than_sell/).  The top comment thread details how much of a hero he is to the video gaming industry, the third from the top claims that Valve would be different if bought by EA (completely true), followed by a comment of ""Yeah, fucking their customers in the ass"" with double the points. This is already one of the finest pinnacles of everything we've come to loathe about this subreddit.  *But it gets better.*

Taking its place as the second post: [Turns out

This thread also features a top comment of calling out the subreddit:

It's not like these are even the only two.  Frequently the top comment threads of posts will directly call out that this is simply jerking, which actually shitpost all over its own meta by having the top comment thread hijacked by Sure_Ill_Draw_That, and even though I'll admit I really enjoy many of the things he posts, it's still a problem.

Ever since I saw this thread this morning, but on the other, there are so many responses that display such an ignorance of modern music that I couldn't help it. Personally, I consider /r/Music to be one of the worst defaults out there, but the fact I like music so much means I suffer through the bad stuff for the occasional good post.

Posts like the following

&gt;Modern alternative rock??

&gt;If Nickelback, I'd be so happy.

&gt;It's hard for me to describe what I think is so terrible about them. It might be the real hard instrumentals and the hoity toity lyrics with their stupid ass melodies. I just picture 45 year old blondes ""dancing"" to this shit with their ""woo!!!!"" girlfriends in some shitty bar in the country. You know the type: big blonde hair with an entire can of aquanet keeping it perfectly teased wearing tight tapered jeans and a leopard print tank top. Overly tan

Now

Then we go to what I think is the worst post in the entire thread.

&gt;As someone who enjoys a lot of music

&gt;This is one of the reasons I think nowadays has the worst era of music

Anyone who has even an ounce of historical music knowledge knows this has always happened since the advent of the record player. What separates people like Nicki Minaj from Elvis or The Monkees? They are all equally manufactured pop acts, when people try to pass off ignorant opinions as if they hold any merit. What kind of music do you have to listen to to not realize that popular music fifty years ago is just as vapid as music today? The fact this got 85 gross upvotes from the same sub who can't seem to let go of the most popular rock bands like Led Zeppelin and Tool is confusingly ironic.

There thankfully are some [voices of](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1fniow/what_era_of_music_is_the_absolute_worst_of_all/cac0lss) [reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1fniow/what_era_of_music_is_the_absolute_worst_of_all/cac0mu9) in the thread that shed some light onto the bias of some of the redditors. They more or less make some pretty compelling arguments that I think shed some light onto the bias that many redditors have against modern music.

There are more, but being willfully ignorant of music is something that irritates me. I understand completely that taste is subjective, but when you make such large blanket statements over styles that have lots of variety, that defense gets thrown out the window.",,False,,False,t3_1fp3py

Let's ignore the fact this happens everywhere and that the big fish eating the smaller fish is common practice. Nope, it's entirely the fault of the stupid corporations ruining our innocent game companies!

* Also /r/mildlyinteresting. It has 100k+ subscribers but in the event you haven't heard of it it is good. It is sort of like /r/pics but with less bullshit attention

* I'm adding /r/baseball just because it is a great community. People trash talk but generally it is all in good fun and it can sometimes be hilarious. In season it is great for news and highlights and out of season dumb baseball related stuff gets posted but it is still interesting and not boring.

&gt; [Netanyahu speaking candidly

At first glance this sounds like something significant

I'm sure you've all guessed where this is going - a blatant rush to post any criticism of Israel to accrue the most spoils. First comment:

&gt; [Israel is not our friend and never was our friend. However Israel takes the billions we give them (most of any nation) and uses it to buy our politicians and buy the best PR campaign money can buy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/13e9zt/netanyahu_speaking_candidly_not_realizing_cameras/c736cfz)

Residing at **1683 points 6 hours ago** (That's an upvote every ~13s) the tone is set with an anti-Israeli opinion straight off and a bit of subtle finger pointing to the amerikans. I think this is what kicked off the entire thing. It's the perfect storm and I can only imagine how smug the bloke must be now that he's been upvoted so much.

The next reply was inevitable given the open ended initial comment

&gt; [And if you make a view like this public you are immediately slandered as an anti-Semite and likely compared to Hitler. Quite the canundrum.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/13e9zt/netanyahu_speaking_candidly_not_realizing_cameras/c736fz2)

no words. 

&gt; I am fervently anti-religion now, none of that mattered... Shit pisses me off...

Now I see the light now. I've fully concluded every single part of the Isreali-Arab conflict - all by unbrainwashing myself from my repressive shackles of a religious family.

&gt; I also remember going to church, everyone at Church celebrated because ""God heard our prayers"". Even more ridiculous, when the Passion of the Christ came out, we prayed it would be successful, and when it did, we celebrated again. Looking back I realized how stupid it is, but at the time

&gt; I think there is too much spent on keeping people alive when there is no hope. Mostly I think this applies to old people (but I can see some younger cases also), it is time to say goodbye to granny.

I've never heard *that* one before

&gt; I never want kids.
People tell me it is unnatural for a woman to feel that way. And people tend to smile patronizingly and tell me I will change my mind.

May I direct you over to /r/childfree?

&gt; I think euthanasia should be legal. When people get really old, people with dementia, who are so out of it that they can't hold a conversation and aren't aware of their surroundings. People with painful terminal illnesses. Elderly folk who are quickly losing their health, where it hurts to walk around or maybe they're facing expensive and painful medical procedures to prolong life.
Just let them end it with dignity.
I also think fetuses with disorders should be aborted if it is detected. Down syndrome, etc. Try again for a healthy child--don't intentionally bring into the world something that will live in pain, or be unable to live independently.

&gt; I'm extremely uncomfortable around mentally handicapped people.

At first I thought, and the ""wipe out evidence of internet piracy around the world"" quote was the words of the author of the article, not of anyone in particular. The only thing quoted from any official is from the New Zealand Detective inspector who oversaw the operation saying that the FBI told him Kim Dotcom may have, ""carried a device with him to delete servers around the world"", which is a lot less outlandish than what the title of the post implies and a lot less unbiased. As such there was no official comment from the FBI. Of course Dotcom ended up having no such device making the FBI look foolish but it's not as ridiculous as the title implying he had a device that could wipe out all evidence of internet piracy. So I went into the comments section and saw most people [making fun of the Doomsday quote that no one besides Dotcom's lawyer actually said.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/y1szk/the_fbi_justified_the_insane_raid_of_kim_dotcoms/c5rk145)

To start, it is called 'День России, Den' Rossii', which literally means 'Day of Russia', or 'Russia's Day'.

Uh, perhaps?

&gt;""Independence"" day

And a redditor with two deft strokes of a quotation mark completely tore through the sham of Russian independence. Sitting there smugly

&gt;You mean oxymoron day in Russia yesterday?

I am afraid not to talk to you, because not talking to you and talking to others represents being sexist and is therefore sexual harassment (this actually happened to me, I almost got fired). I am afraid to sleep with you because you might decide it was rape. I am afraid to not sleep with you because you might accuse me of rape to get even, and today that accusation is as bad as having done the deed.

Except the news story is question is from a very conservative source, at my time of viewing, had at least 25 upvotes -- these aren't just pulled from the detritus at the bottom.

This was the line that made me realise what a perfect jerk stew we had going: 

&gt; Unless you support totalitarianism

THERE'S YOUR CHOICE AMERICA: Nazi Germany or allowing Obama to consider thinking about an executive order that might limit gun violence. 

In a very similar vein: 

&gt; This action would put this country on the fast track to a future dictatorship. Without the 2nd amendment

I won't lie; I love the idea that Nick Clegg is second in command in a dictatorship where the people can't legally take up arms against the government. 

And of course

&gt; The govt will start with banning the sale of assault weapons
Once the assault weapons are gone
Note: I currently own zero guns.

Now they've convinced themselves that Obama will literally rip their guns from the hands of their law-abiding

&gt; Whether you agree or disagree with the 2nd amendment, using nothing but an executive order, even sidestepping congress. BTW, this is nothing short of something that is at at the very least going to see thousands dead and hundreds of thousands more herded into private prisons. Most of these will be people that simply would not give up their firearm they legally purchased and use for protection or hunting. Most of these will be people who would never commit a serious crime.

And of course guns are necessary because without them the government is not afraid of the people -- the same government that has the largest military in the world

&gt; First, the British). If we, the people, let our government take our only right, our only true power to defend ourselves from the government away from us... what do we have left? The famous quote from Thomas Jefferson says it all, ""When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, I have never felt anguish and hate towards gun violence as bad as I did against the Sandy Hook incident. I have three brothers that are in elementary school now and I couldn't bear to lose them. However

This one is along the same lines

&gt; ""The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it.""

Similar stuff

&gt; So what happens when that .5% of gun owners decide to not let the government take their guns? We have 250

Some commenters get a little Tolkeinesque when talking about the potential civil war that they see breaking out over this:

&gt; That way lies civil war

Other commenters lean more towards George R R Martinesque (kingdom? peasants? what?): 

&gt; To be fair with all the other shit going down in the country the likelihood of more people getting frustrated or desperate enough to get a bit shooty increases. If I was in a position of power and saw my kingdom going to shit I'd want the peasants to have as little access as possible to weapons

DAE Americans are too fat and complacent?

&gt; The only question is how many if will take up arms for the cause if any? I have a feeling that today's complacent society will merely ""hide"" their guns rather than fight back. Much of America is too fat and happy to actually risk their lives standing up for their or anybody else's rights.

The constitutional scholars are all over this one (there are many

Semi-low-effort

A little backstory: 4G LTE is a standard for wireless data communication at high speeds. I'm sure many of you have at least heard of it. Verizon Wireless in the U.S. is notorious for advertising the living hell out of it. HSPA+ is another 4G technology (some say it isn't yeah but that's another debate) that competes with LTE.  

When 4G LTE devices first started becoming available in the U.S. and elsewhere

[LTE is amazing.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/xg2c7/lte_is_amazing/)  

[It was then that I decided how much better LTE was.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/qi8gs/it_was_then_that_i_decided_how_much_better_lte_was/)  

[So AT&amp;T LTE is insanely fast.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/n4tzm/so_att_lte_is_insanely_fast/)  

[I knew LTE was fast but... this is insane.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/nivum/i_knew_lte_was_fast_but_this_is_insane/)  

And a bonus: [PSA: AT&amp;T is going to screw customers with Fake 4G (HSPA+) now

You'll see later why I found this one particularly hilarious.  

-------------------------------------------------------  

So the general consensus was that LTE is insanely fast

BUT, the newest flagship Android device. It was generally praised around the board by tech reviewers, except in one area that it was harshly criticized for: **lack of 4G LTE.**  

Well, can they? NOPE. Nexus/Google fanboyism &gt;&gt;&gt; MUH DATA SPEEDS.  

[What is the LTE controversy?] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12m342/what_is_the_lte_controversy/)  

[T-Mobile's HSPA+ is 42Mbps down. I fail to see why so many people say the Nexus 4's lack of LTE is a dealbreaker when it seems like it's pretty much the same thing. HSPA+ even bested LTE in 11 cities across the country.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12dr9f/tmobiles_hspa_is_42mbps_down_i_fail_to_see_why_so/)  

[Nexus 4 Review - with much less emphasis on the lack of LTE - by CNET UK division] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12mnf2/nexus_4_review_with_much_less_emphasis_on_the/)  

So the above three links basically backtrack over the entire idea that LTE is so awesome guys, **with much less emphasis on the lack of LTE** you can see how mad they got over it.)  

Nexus 4 doesn't have LTE

Wait one damn second.... what the hell is going on today then?

There are only 50 or so comments and they arent upvoted very heavily but [this thread in r/movies about the new Muppets: Most Wanted teaser trailer](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ju0g8/muppets_most_wanted_official_teaser_trailer/) made me mad. I knew it was my duty as a muppet fanatic to preserve my childhood by grouchily complaining on circlebroke.

The trailer is pretty standard. Looks like how a movie trailer for the muppets would look. Barely over a minute long

&gt;Yeah I was onboard until the Moves Like Jager thing...this isn't a Smurfs movie

Umm

&gt;That killed it for me. I'm sure I'll enjoy it but that left a bad taste in my mouth. Also I don't get some people. They'll shit on the Smurfs

There's a reason people say you need context - because context is important in like 99% of situations, so they show you a pop culture reference. Like I said, 20 seconds of one song and it killed it for you? Sorry for your loss.

&gt;Scooter doing Maroon 5? Uhhhh

""So one awkward puppet who cant sing doing the song is bad, then it'd be good.""

&gt;jeez

Literally nothing about this sentence is true.

&gt;It screamed soulless cash-in for me

Yep

&gt;sigh All the voices are still very wrong. That's not how Kermit, but still sad - the poor man's Jimmy Kimmel.

Of course the voices are off

&gt;This seems like it'll be a cash in =/ Seems like they are giving up on sight gags / subtle humor and just going for cheap laughs and pop easy pop reference ... sad :( Also

How could they even put ""subtle humor"" in the trailer? It's only a minute long. You have no idea what the humor in the movie is going to be like.

The guy who posted the Alarm Clock monologue, has been brigaded all over the place because of the fact that redditors would rather have SLJ read *the fucking Navy Seal copypasta* than a motivational speech that might actually be practical and interesting for some people. I mean sure, it's cheesy as fuck, but this guy got *death threats* over this shit.

Reddit is OK with death threats and doxxing, being making sure that Samuel L Jackson never gives a motivational speech. I feel like this is the premise to a South Park episode, but without the self-awareness.

All comments there that so much as ask why the copypasta is so much better than a speech with actual effort put in have been downvoted into the negatives. I'm not going to go through the tedium of linking them all

I was browsing Reddit when I came across [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/) thread. Although there were a few positive comments

As a preface

And you know what? I still think that the teenage years are rough. For all the disadvantages that ""adult life"" has (bills, I can wear what I want, and I can socialize with whoever I want. Teenagers have no such luxury; they have to follow the rules at school and at home. They are subjected to arbitrary authority pretty much all day. 

So what is the general response of redditors when a teenager questions an arbitrary rule imposed upon them? 

[Apparently he's an ungrateful shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/c7q2zjp) or a [snot nosed punk](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/c7q4gnd)

After all

I am not saying that this is an important issue; in the end

[For example, those problems seemed like real problems. 30 year old problems seem like ""real"" problems when you're 30. A 70 year old might look at a 30 year old and say ""He has no problems. He has everything: a great job, youth, and a great girlfriend. What does he have to complain about?"" Yet from the perspective of the 30 year old, he has ""real"" problems: he has bills, his job is stressful, and he's concerned about his relationship. 

It's all relative. Yet because its ""cool"" to be dismissive towards teenagers on Reddit

Reddit loves the mantra ""question everything""... unless you are a teenager; then you are an ungrateful brat.

**Part 1:**

Gather round children and let me tell you a tale. A tale of justice and injustice, lets call him ‘John’.

John was a clever little chap and a helpful one too. After making a home for himself in the kingdom of Reddit he could often be found in /r/askscience spouting insightful answers and divulging his wisdom of Chemistry to his curious young students. ""When paint fades in sunlight over time

&gt;The color of pigments is related to their chemical structure. Briefly, can cause changes in the pigments (most often caused by damage from high energy UV radiation as you suggest). Due to these changes the optical properties of these pigments can change, such that they could absorb at different wavelengths, with different ""strengths"" (or extinction coefficients to be more precise). In some cases due to such changes the pigments will no longer even absorb visible light, making them effectively transparent.

To all who knew him, it seemed, could do no wrong… or could he??

Askscience was not the only sub that John would frequent, a place where people came together to celebrate everything that was good with the world. John was welcomed to this promised-land with open arms - he'd surely fit in perfectly. But, unbeknownst to the happy little elves of /r/aww, John had a dark side - an unrequited fetish for the devious and diabolical. He had devised a plan so deranged and so disturbing I can barely bring myself to type the words, and he was about to unleash this unthinkable abomination unto the poor and innocent aww-folk.

**John… would repost pictures of cute animals. He would take pictures that had already been posted and post them again!**

See the examples below

[The Horror](http://i.imgur.com/m65uCz1.png)

[THE HORROR](http://i.imgur.com/i3TaQ07.png)

[**THE HORROR!!!!!**](http://i.imgur.com/NbVGpa6.png)

John lived his deplorable double life for some time. He continued his good work in askscience, trying to act clever, but John had the answer:

&gt;A perfect mirror reflects all incident light regardless of wavelength, then light with the same spectrum would be reflected. Therefore a mirror can be said to be white.

He went on, all posts were lauded as being the pinnacle of originality, but now they just seemed tired and oddly familiar. The elves had never seen a repost before and what they experienced was leaving them confused, frightened and angry.

&gt;as the owner of this image

said one miffed OP. The next guy was a little more inventive.

&gt;Seven submissions, so please stop reposting other people's stuff only for your number to grow bigger. Also, this won't make any girl like you, so please stop trying.

and the next was slightly less inventive

&gt;Literally Hitler

The happy little aww-folk weren’t so happy any more. The sub was fast becoming a dark and terrible place. Someone was responsible and they had to be brought to justice!

---

**Part 2:**

I remember the night it happened. It was a dark and stormy night and John had just returned home from another hard days teaching. He looked out to /r/aww to see it ravaged and destitute. The monster had taken hold. A spiralling cacophony of reposts among reposts of reposts of reposts. Reposts as far as the eye could see and it was all his creation.  He gave a wry smile

The elves, anything, that could lead them to the source of all this madness. And then… there! In the distance! A new post popped up. Some cat… and a dog… with big eyes… looking fluffy. [THAT’S BEEN POSTED BEFORE!!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/tuzX2.jpg)

John looked up.

&gt;**Check out his post history... do it!**

one elf screamed (presumably the leader based on the number of upvotes he received). The game was up. John ran. The aww-folk mobbed together in a blind rage

&gt;repost slutbag!

one shouted

&gt;I've got him tagged as 'Reposting shitfuck'

bellowed another

&gt;We must win this war!

shouted one wielding his downvote fork.

&gt;“I am trying to fight him but his douchness is very strong.”

John couldn’t fend off the hoard and was chased out of the Reddit kingdom never to be seen again. But this was not enough for vengeful aww-folk. They wanted real retribution. John had gone, the karma in John's reposts was now too powerful to overthrow, their puny downvotes simply swallowed up by the now towering upvote generating machines. 

More frustrated than ever, the clever little elves could not only get back at him for the all those horrific reposts, they could simultaneously destroy his reputation as a reliable contributer as well. All of John’s comments, insightful and thought-provoking as they were, were mercilessly downvoted into oblivion.

I just don't think that this is an excuse to destroy a subreddit with memes

Hey guise. I bet many of you have already noticed that Simcity has been released few days ago and that the servers are still shit. How could you not have when /r/games (and therefore the front page) is constantly spammed with posts full of jerking and anti-EA semen. Our anti-EA hungry jerker can pick from so many options. There are, [rage based rage inducing posts which bring no information but only provide space for jerking](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19p4ks/thought_id_play_a_bit_more_simcity_before_bed/), or [""Simcity BAD BAD BAD reviews""](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19t1gj/simcity_35_on_giant_bomb_feels_more_like_a_really/). But since we've had here on CB already two posts about this, I'm going to take a look at this very shiny and original pearl - /r/simcity. [(play for better enjoyment)](http://inception.davepedu.com/)

I called it a pearl. It's complete shit. The shittiest shit of all shits. We, this subreddit contradicts this belief. Let's have a look at few threads there and see if we can find *anything* worthy of spending time reading. 

I will try to rate posts based on my opinion about their relevance and quality

1) [Curious about the SimCity server status? I made this to help -- check it out! (self.SimCity)] (http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/) Rating: 2/5

In my opinion, only user-made helpful website which can actually help you, even in small amount (you don't have to open the client to check the server status). Still, a neckbeard finds its way:

&gt;[What's impressive is that you had access to less data than the SimCity devs and actually made a more useful tool than any of their status updates from the last three days. Congrats!](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/c8rrbig)

This is the kind of posts our engraged neckbeard wants to read. Outside-of-reddit source approving of jerking to the max. You can see that Polygon started with rating for the game (9.5) and it's been dropping constantly. I don't want to comment much on it but there is one sentence that made me laugh: *""The experience currently on offer is now significantly altered from what was reviewed*

1358630106.0,16w78u,More on reddit and contrarianism: the subreddit where everything is always wrong ,citizen-blue,119,19,25,"My hatred of reddit comes in waves.  

The first thing that alerted me to the possibility that this might not be the place for me was the misogyny

Next, 'witty' comments above all else.  Whatever it is, I think this is the thing that quietly grates on me the most and makes me never want to open another comment thread.  Maybe I'm just a humorless asshole, but I'm sick of everything being a bad joke all the time.

Finally, I decided to investigate further.  

There is one subreddit that I believe most embodies reddit's contrarian nature: /r/science.  That is because the good redditors of /r/science will argue with absolutely anything, but I want to take it a step further.  I am here to posit that redditors doesn't dispute the findings posted there just because they don't understand or aren't interested in how science works, but because they are simply committed, on principle, to arguing with anything, anywhere, at any time.  Period.  

My hypothesis is simple:  in /r/science posts, one of the top comments will criticize 1) the title, 2) the methodology or 3) something else they've determined to be a fatal flaw in the complex, professional study they learned about 3 minutes ago.  Sometimes they may even be right.  Sometimes they may be wrong.  It doesn't matter.  What matters is that they found a problem.  

What bothers me is not just that there are always critical comments.  Given enough comments, they also love the guy who argued with the arguer.  This is the dark heart of reddit contrarianism.

I went to /r/science, but all that means is I looked for post about study findings, rather than, say, the discovery of water on mars.  I didn't discriminate based on the content of the studies.  These are the first 5 I opened:

**[Study finds drinking soft drinks (even diet ones) is correlated with higher rates of depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16ie2z/study_finds_drinking_soft_drinks_even_diet_ones/)**

Top comment is a direct quote from the article saying the study did not show the drinks actually cause depression.  

Neither the post title nor the article suggested otherwise.  Still

**[Asking specific groups of drivers to stay off the road at certain times can dramatically reduce traffic](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16m2hn/asking_specific_groups_of_drivers_to_stay_off_the/)**

Second highest rated comment complains that he doesn't see the specific groups targeted or methods for keeping them off the road.  

Good point -- should we investigate further?  No

**[minor \(even 3 second\) interruptions have surprisingly large impacts on ability to complete tasks](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16jxfa/minor_even_3_second_interruptions_have/)**

I have to admit

**[A 14-year study of elephants in northern Kenya concludes that the adult behemoths are more likely to die at the hands of humans than from natural causes](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16px85/a_14year_study_of_elephants_in_northern_kenya/)**

Top comment: National Geographic has been saying this for years. 

Ah, the top comment responding to this person explains why the study is nonetheless necessary, but fuck it, this is textbook contrarianism and needs to be higher!

**[No backboned animal has been found that can harness the sun – until now](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16tfx0/no_backboned_animal_has_been_found_that_can/)**

I don't why I picked this one, so here we go.

Second highest rated comment points out that the creature doesn't actually use photosynthesis

That's right fuckers, the next comment explains why this doesn't contradict any of the claims at all, but the damage is done.  Another dirty lying scientist taken down a a few notches.

So there you have it.  Proof that reddit will argue with anything.  Now I'm off to post this to /r/science so they can tell me why I'm wrong.  

Edit: fixed shit.

I agree, he's a racist jerk, but that doesn't mean that he wasn't an exceptionally good baseball player with firsthand experience of the league and of other players - even if someone is a deplorable cocksucker, or had done something terrible in the past, it doesn't narrow their identity down to something exceedingly easy to consume for the sake of distributing everything into black and white - unless, of course, where it's nearly impossible for anyone to accept the idea that people

I bring that up because in this thread, and he's conveniently timing the releases to generate more page clicks, or there is some other type of motive going on (questions like this *never* hurt, unless you're reddit because it's impossible for someone to be good and bad at the same time). We saw exactly the same thing with Snowden - Reddit's mind exploded that people were focusing on the person who did it and focusing on the fact that, by law, he committed a crime rather than focusing exclusively on the content of the leak (which the media did, wholeheartedly). 

And of course, and Glen Greenwald and Edward Snowden are angels sent from heaven who spend all of their off-time rescuing kittens from trees and helping old ladies cross streets. *HEIL GREENWALD*

These revelations are important but don't lose sight of the fact that although Snowden has moral reasons for the leak everyone else is doing this for a living.

Final Edit:

Thank you everyone for your input. I've learned quite a bit about people's opinions regarding this sub and my ideas. Moral of the story seems to be that CB is not meant to be the high court of reddit. It's not CB's job to point out what is in line with what reddit should or shouldn't be. CB's purpose is to call out and bitch about the circlejerks in its own self-recognized antijerk-jerk. I've realized now that CB can't possibly focus too much on the negative because is only meant to focus on the negative and because of that it needs to be only a part of your redditing experience. I think it's been interesting to see the CB community define its own role in the system. Thanks,False,,t5_2tnz9,1349005079.0,,,t3_10ojn3

The reason I'm unsubbing being that all the topics that ever hit my frontpage are ""The government is evil for spying on us"".


Now, and am not even american, so blind nationalism doesn't come into this. I *do* find it morally objectionable to spy on people.

But

And now the gov is doing, apparently, is evil.

To recap; Reddit is perfectly fine with the idea of people having their privacies ignored if they are suspected terrorists... as long as *Reddit* is the one who suspects them and breaks their privacy. Anyone else is forbidden, we totally apologised, 'tis cool.

I also find it dificult to believe that the government will have the time and manpower needed to read every single email from every individual

&gt;the government will only search ""terrorists""... which means anything they want really

Not half a year ago everyone in this goddamn website was saying that ""terrorist"" was ""people who dresses in black and have a backpack"".



There is also the strange notion that governments spying on people is something new.

There was a comment that went

&gt;Back in my day there was great respect for private communications

Now, such as WW2, opening the letter the soldiers sent home and censoring any information, from the name of the soldier to the places it named, was a common practice.



But really

The comments seem to go

&gt;The gubment is wrong to spy on us
&gt;&gt;Yeah I agree
&gt;&gt;&gt;Aaaany day now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yup

All the way to the bottom. There is no useful discussion, there are no links to organizations that oppose the idea and which people could subscribe to, just people agreeing that yes, I, too, find this evil.

 What?

This is appealing to reddit's upvote twitch-finger on so many levels. Allow me to elaborate.

* Superiority Complex. Without the majority of reddit having any influence on what's being mentioned in the post
* And last, I might go out on a limb, and give the author here the benefit of the doubt that he was attempting to make a sarcastic quip at the end.

The amount of people with the kind of genetic defects that can only survive due to the advances of modern medicine is quite small. And even if we kept all of these people alive until they reached sexual maturity and they all decided to reproduce

1344305537.0,xsugf,Let's see what Reddit's main demographics have to say on the parenting topic of teaching the body and privacy to a 3 year old. ,RhinestoneTaco,103,9,113,"In the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/xs7ap/so_we_have_been_teaching_our_3_year_old_that_her/), as kids are want to do) which then becomes a humorous issue when one of the child's books uses the phrase in another way. 

Awkward humor all around. Surely we can all just get a chuckle out of this

Oh no

Begin the lecture:

&gt;euphemisms help no one. 

And in response to that: 

&gt;They help parents who are too prude to be honest with their children

""Too prude"" in referring to genitalia being different than say

Deep breath folks

 
&gt; A three year old has no problem accepting that a vagina should be called a vagina. The problem is that we call it cutesy things and treat vagina as if it were a foul word. 

. 

&gt; I don't understand

. 

&gt; Vagina' isn't a dirty word. Despite what Republicans would have you believe. 

. 

&gt; Call the ""special place"" by a the name she herself could have used

. 

&gt; And this is why you should refer to the proper term ""vagina""

. 

&gt; At 3

. 

&gt; That is exactly why you should be honest with your kids

. 

&gt; Perhaps it would be best to avoid such confusion by teaching your daughter what her ""special place"" is actually called: her vulva. She knows what her nose, eyes and mouth are, right? The vulva and vagina are just body parts. You may stunt your daughter's growth by making her think that any part of her body is strange or mysterious. You may stunt your daughter's ability to be intimate with the person of her choosing when she's an adult by raising her to believe that her vulva and vagina aren't ever to be talked about.
The external genitalia are just like any other body part

. 

&gt; How about you tell your kid that it's called a vagina. That will clear up a lot of shit later on. Also
Am I the only one around here

. 

&gt; Thus

. 

&gt; Who the fuck lies to their kid about sex/gender/development/puberty any more. I mean seriously?

. 

&gt; Reason number one parents should just man up and teach their children real names for things. 

. 

&gt; ""Special place"" WTF ?? You couldnt have found are more retarded name for child's ""vagina"" ??? 

. 

&gt; Why not just call it a vagina? It's a vagina. Not a special place.
""Your vagina is private""
Problem solved. 

.  

&gt; THIS IS WHY WE TEACH THEM WHAT THINGS ARE CALLED. Vagina. Vagina vagina vagina vagina vagina vagina vagina. Read it over and over because YOU'RE the only one whose honestly uncomfortable saying or hearing the word from her. 

. 

&gt; I think using nicknames for items sometimes isn't the best thing. My aunts and uncles are racist and it wasn't until later in life when I learned that the item's real name wasn't the horrible racist nickname they had come up with.

. 

&gt; Believe it or not

. 

&gt; That is exactly why you should be honest with your kids

1374589733.0,1ivw2e,How to make a Subreddit Jerkometer Part 1: a study of /r/askreddit cycles and a comparison between /r/atheism and /r/atheismrebooted,acetylserine,121,31,25,"I've seen quite a few ways to measure the quality of a subreddit. They usually rely on number of words per post, I'm not. Here is the method:


1) Choose subreddit to use this 'jerkometer' on.

2) Circlejerking, I think that this means we should be looking at reposts, in the same way that if we were looking at the jerkiness of a single thread we may choose to count the number of jerky comments or something. So, we will go down the front page (we want to measure the *current* jerkiness) and find out how many times each thread has been posted before in that particular subreddit (You can begin to imagine what will happen when we look at /r/AskReddit given its much discussed cyclical rhythms). This will be the jerk-rating for a thread. I'm only going to do the first 10 or it will take too long.

3) Obviously

Let's begin then. For text posts

-----

**/r/AskReddit - you know you're leaning forwards in your chair**

* Guys
**4**

* Have you ever stumbled upon a dark family secret?
**50** wow (search string: dark family secret)

* What was the worst thing to get to the front page?
**2**

* Girls
**4**

* Which movie would you say had the most unnecessary sequel?
**6**

* What stupid things did you do when you were younger to try to look cooler?
**2**

* What's the first step that you would take if you accidentally killed someone?
**2**

* Let's pretend Hell has a room reserved uniquely for you
**430** oh lord (search string: personal hell)

* What movie did you absolutely love as a kid
**3**

* Desk workers of reddit - what are the ways in which you secretly rebel against the man?
**1** 

-----**JERKOMETER READING: 50.4**-----

So we can see that we get some decent questions interspersed with a few 'jackpots' which are asked every few weeks. We should find that less jerkier subreddits have fewer jackpots then. 

-----

**Let's compare /r/atheism and /r/atheismrebooted and see what happens!**

*Note: since /r/atheism has been around much longer, i.e. only doing the top 5 for each one.*


/r/atheism first

* I'm The 14-Year-Old Who Wrote The ""Jesus Isn't A Dick So Keep Him Out of My Vagina"" Sign In Texas And Was Labeled A ""Whore"" By Strangers Online (article)

A**1** + AR**1** = **2**

Riiiiight, the more downvoted the top controversial comment will be, we can use the karma of the top 'top' comment multiplied by the absolute value of the karma of the top 'controversial comment', then multiply by number of comments since we know that as a thread gets longer, it tends to complete shit, then divide by the number online to account for subreddit size. This gives us a different measure of circlejerkiness. So let's try again.

* * I'm The 14-Year-Old Who Wrote The ""Jesus Isn't A Dick So Keep Him Out of My Vagina"" Sign In Texas And Was Labeled A ""Whore"" By Strangers Online 

**(921x3x1077)/1210= 2459**

* Women's basketball coach pushed her religion on players and actually gets fired

**(370x1x469)/1210= 143**

Atheist war hero Alan Turing -- the ""Father of Computer Science"" and who shortened WWII by 2 years by breaking the Nazi Engima machine -- is finally to be pardoned for a gay ""offense"" committed in the 1950s

**[scores hidden so ignore]**

**(8x2x28)/1210 = 0.37**

* Tomorrow my Grandpa goes into open heart surgery

**(22x2x10)/1210 = 0.36**

-----**/r/atheism JERKOMETER SCORE: 527**-----

now for the moment you've all been waiting for!

------

/r/atheismrebooted

* Saving souls one bag at a time.

**(5x5x15)/131 = 3**

* It would be funny if it weren't to tragic.

**(19x1x15)/131 = 2**

* Jesus isn't a dick...

**(10x4x28)/131 = 9**

* I'm The 14-Year-Old Who Wrote The ""Jesus Isn't A Dick So Keep Him Out of My Vagina"" Sign In Texas And Was Labeled A ""Whore"" By Strangers Online

**(23x1x29)/131 = 5**

* A meme to honor Good Guy r/atheismrebooted

**(20x10x39)/131 = 60**

-----**/r/atheismrebooted JERKOMETER SCORE: 16**-----

I bet that's not what you were expecting, /r/atheismrebooted still has a comparatively low level of activity. The next two posts after the five I reviewed above actually have zero comments, which just doesn't happen in /r/atheism, definitely not in the top 10 on the front page oh no. At the moment, it seems that the big jerks are /r/atheism related (see the one that got a score of 60) and not atheism the subject. It's obvious that the memes are worse content, but they only have the *potential* to be more jerky then a text post. Without lots of people, there is no circlejerk (well obviously). The majority of people there seem to only be summoned by posts about the atheism-atheismrebooted war and so what I'm saying is that /r/atheismrebooted is not outjerking its bigger brother at all and is actually akin to a specialized /r/subredditdrama trying to focus, on its perceived superiority to its rival (in other words, so let's hear what you have to say.

Most of this essay is based on the idea that r/atheism has two primary purposes:

* To provide a safe haven for atheists (especially including teenagers) that may face actual discrimination for their beliefs
* To instill discussion regarding atheism and debating systems of religion and the effects they may have on a society.

In some sort of quasi-revolution against ""taking away our mee mees, inspiring many a ratheist to chime in with some well-informed discussion about the new moderation policy that was put in place.

---

The first brilliant comment that we see?

&gt;holy christ that was well done. that seriously summed up the argument better than any post i've seen so far [+1593]

Honestly

One is that the moderators banning memes has taken away the voice of rathiests in their own subreddit and takes away from the self-regulating voting system that has worked so well in the past. This would be a great argument if it weren't for the fact that it's completely wrong.

The moderation policy says that memes and images have to be linked to in self-posts

The other is that forcing memes and images into self-posts makes it significantly harder to browse it since there are no thumbnails. Okay... so what? Self-posts can still be browsed easily

That

---

&gt;&gt;The mod system is easily the worst part of Reddit. No transparency, and on an sub like /r/atheism they really wield their power like the fat little hateful nerds that they are. [+103]

Subreddits are **literally** a dictatorship and the moderators are **literally** Hitler.

If moderators putting images in self posts is taking away the voting power of redditors, dense argument that everyone and their mothers have been using to bring back direct links to may mays.

---

&gt;Well done and you worked in "" Stalin "" on cue. up vote sir [+118]

le upvote sir? so well played.

Clearly

---

&gt;This reflects my opinions perfectly. I'm left in awe. Hopefully we get some solution to the current crisis. [+41]

""The current crisis?"" If a change to how you're supposed to post macros is a crisis, if you really want to limit it to reddit, the doxxing drama that surrounded /r/jailbait.

---

Unfortunately, is too large for any movement against low-effort content to succeed. Not only will people become pissy over something as insignificant as a link, the same low-effort content will simply take on a new form. A look at [the front page of r/atheism](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism) at the time of this post reveals these top links:

1. [Alabama gets their first High School Atheist club. Christian response - death threats!](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fx8gs/alabama_gets_their_first_high_school_atheist_club/) [+1921]
2. [Oregon Senators vote to require parents who don’t want a child vaccinated (for example for religious reasons)to get a science lesson first.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fwfqc/oregon_senators_vote_to_require_parents_who_dont/) [+2041]
3. [Megachurch member was seduced by married pastor when a teen. Recounts how her mom and aunt had sex with the good reverend too! Oh by the way

It's closer to the purpose of reddit: aggregate links that interest a subcommunity, we see the same issues that have plagued it before:

1. **Editorialized title.** (""Christian response - death threats!"") The ""Christian"" response is the response of only people in that area and the story is intentionally bent to make it look like religion as a whole is the problem here
2. **DAE science??** Not particularly relevant to atheism in general and the title is editorialized to make it appear that fighting religious excuses was the main rationale for the Oregon senate voting to require a science lesson.
3. **Editorialized title. (x9999)** Holy fuck is this title editorialized to all hell. As soon as they see some sort of stereotypical child molestation from a church

Which should make the issue of may-mays on the subreddit seem relatively minor; which it's not. Atheism will continue to be confused with antitheism and fundies will continue to have their beliefs questioned by the enlightened and the euphoric, Sagans, and Nyes left and right and keeping their fedoras as trophies of war.

A comment which slanders the whole Islamic gaming community because of one person. He also makes it seems as if Muslims are part of this exclusive group which enjoy games and only enjoys them with each other. I hope he's a troll but even if he was the fact that he's near top is downright disheartening.

""They see me toleratin'

This person comments with an overused and boring meme while also bringing up brave comments of NASA and mars.

""Who gives a fuck

TIL has definitely become what is essentially ""today I copy pasted a link from thinkprogress"". Curious as to just how bad it is, the topical shift has been. In order to do this I used the wayback machine and picked various dates roughly 6 months apart. Then I looked at the top 20 links for that day and picked the ones that I felt purposely enabled a reddit-style jerk.  My criteria were basically anything bad about america, cops, religion, banks, corporations, and republicans. I ignore any comment that doesn't have substantial karma.

**June 16

**Sept 23

&gt;*TIL - The author of the original USA Pledge of Allegiance

Not necessarily a jerk

&gt;Pledging allegiance to a flag is just fucking ridiculous.

#
&gt;Indeed. It would be cool to live in a country where such a thing was completely optional.

(this comment is sarcasm

&gt;you mean in every other country in the world where it is not even optional

#
&gt;It would be even cooler to live in a country where it wasn't drilled into the minds of impressionable children on a daily basis before they could even understand what they were saying

#
&gt;Your sarcasm is pointless. Yes, you will be judged by others and you can make your life very hard.

#
&gt;My favorite thing about the ORIGINAL pledge is that ""under god"" was not in it. Later added by protestant politicians.... To this day I omit that phrase.

That's it for the day

**Dec 23

&gt;*TIL that the FBI and government are allowed to lie in courts for the sake of ""national security""*

Oh good.

&gt;This is why we need wikileaks.

#
&gt;the war on terror is the perfect excuse to be evil. 

#
&gt;The police can even lie while interrogating you. (Within limits.)

#
&gt;TIL some people need to read an intro criminal justice book.

There's actually a surprising amount of calling out the OP for sensationalizing, something amazing happens...

&gt;i guess i never bothered to look up much more on chip tatum past the hours of interviews online. that does raise a red flag tho

It was a simpler time.  It was a better time.

&gt;*TIL During World War 1, to sing carols, trade equipment and play games between their lines*

What a heartwarming story about

&gt;Regular men fighting their commanders' war. I will never kill another man for the United States

ehhh

At least this was the only highly upvoted comment in that vein.  Jerk averted

**March 11

&gt;*TIL that Tommy Chong pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife and his son during Operation Pipe Dreams.*

#
&gt;I watched a documentary about this on Netflix. It really was a pretty strange ordeal

#
&gt;Such is life in the police state.

The top submissions of way back in 2012 didn't get a lot of comments (just 17 for this thread) so that's it for this one.  In fact

**June 28

&gt;*TIL on June 27

Top link

&gt;*TIL Louis CK dropped his management agency because they asked Joe Rogan to apologize to Carlos Mencia for outing him as a joke theif.*

Second link

&gt;*TIL an estimated 5% of US flights have an undercover Air Marshal on board who carries a gun and is authorized to make arrests.*

Yes, so hey that's...that's something.

**Sept 27

&gt;*TIL that every time he stays in a hotel with a bible in the bedside table

Can you guess what the comments are?  No, and be amazed!

&gt;That sounds like a pointless exercise. 

#
&gt;Essentially destroying literature

#
&gt;Soo it's ok to destroy someone elses property as long as you believe in the cause? 

#
&gt;Thats a dick move. It has no real effect and is just disrespectful to Christians. Don't like it

All three with over 200 karma.  I literally would have never predicted this.  There are plenty of ""WELL YEAH BUT"" comments about how christians literally hate all gays

One person even said

&gt;The hypocrisy of the left

And got 65 karma.  What?  How?  What?

Don't worry though

&gt;*TIL an 18 year old freshmen funded his education by asking 2.8 million people for one penny*

#
&gt;Sadly

#
&gt;It is if you're not American.

#
&gt;Totally

To be fair

**December 27

&gt;*TIL that ""America's public school teachers almost uniformly now come from the bottom 25 percent of their college classes.""*

Marked as misleading by the mods.  1000 karma anyway.  Almost every comment is ""as a teacher

&gt;Teacher here. I doubt that things are THAT bad currently. The US education system does not

:)

&gt;*TIL 8.8 billion in Cash 

#
&gt;Could also be written as

&gt;""Under the table payment received in iraq""

#
&gt; How in the hell does that happen?

&gt;On purpose.

#
&gt;Ohh

**March 19

&gt;*TIL Louis Armstrong smoked marijuana during the entire 45 years he blew his trumpet*

The comments are what you think.

&gt;*TIL the Scrubs episode which poked fun at multi-camera sitcoms won an Emmy for ""Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing"".*

Dozens and dozens of iterations of ""Bazinga""?  You bet!  ""I hate canned laughter but only when it's on a show I don't like""?  You also bet that too!  I'm not even going to bother.

&gt;*TIL: Hundreds of TSA agents have been caught stealing from passengers.*

#
&gt;I hope this doesn't suprise anyone. This is what happens when you create a pseudo law enforcement agency and fill it with underachieving applicants. 

#
&gt;Security theater is the practice of investing in countermeasures intended to provide the feeling of improved security while doing little or nothing to actually achieve it.

&gt;Beyond the familiar hassle at airport security, would have a measurable impact on public wellbeing.

#
&gt;How many terrorists has TSA reported catching? None.

And so forth.  It's hard to find a comment that's *not* part of the jerk here.  Plenty of comments about how they were taking their 4000 year old sarcophagus to grandma's and the TSA stole it.  

**August 9

&gt;*TIL Under civil forfeiture, cars and homes from Americans who haven’t been convicted of wrongdoing, with almost no constitutional protection.*

#
&gt;*TIL the 'Department of Defense Excess Property Program'

#
&gt;*TIL Ronald Reagan once said that the effects of smoking one marijuana cigarette is equal in brain damage to being on Bikini Island during a hydrogen bomb test*

www.np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/

He has been given a total of ~~24~~ 59 reddit golds.  In fact

Whoever decided to allow people to gift reddit gold should have their salary tripled.  I cannot begin to fathom how much money it has made them so far, to literally give them a gold star for their comment.

Below is a catalog of his comments that received gold:

* [There are two things this could reference. One is the free/pay for software mix. The Internet has benefited from having lots of free stuff and lots of commercial software. It has been interesting see people inventing hybrid models. Even stuff that is pretty commercial often has free versions for some audiences. Even the most open stuff often have services people choose to pay for.  The second thing is the anonymous versus identified tension. This is another one where both will probably thrive since you want anonymity for some things and full identity for others. I am surprised how little progress has been made in the identity space but it will improve.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcpjm?context=3)

This one received an astonishing *six* golds.  All for essentially a politician's response to this question.  At least the top child comment calls it out.

* [Free software. Just kidding.  Books actually.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcq9w?context=3)

The gold for this one is either because he said ""FREE SOFTWARE"" or because he likes books.

* [Kids. Cheap cheeseburgers. Open Course Ware courses...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcsh6?context=3)

He's just like us!  He eats cheeseburgers!

* [I have enjoyed meeting other philanthropists and talking about what they work on. I think there is a movement to do more

This is one of his more deserving comments.  4 golds for it.

* [I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them. Warren Buffett was part of an article in Fortune talking about this in 1986 before I met him and it made me think about it and decide he was right. Some people disagree with this but Melinda and I feel good about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcuvm?context=3)

Bill Gates has been a proponent of a higher estate tax for quite some time now

* [Less than I used to. It was part of exercise for snow skiing. I still ski but I am not as hard core...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dd5m4?context=3)

3 golds for that one.

* [He and I respected each other. Our biggest joint project was the Mac where Microsoft had more people on the project than Apple did as we wrote a lot of applications. I saw Steve regularly over the years including spending an afternoon with him a few months before he tragically passed away...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dd9h8?context=3)

Bill Gates + Steve Jobs in the same comment = instant gold.

* [It would be nice if all governments were as rational as the Nordic governments - reaching compromise and providing services broadly. The Economist had a nice special section on this last week. Africa governments have often been weak but you can't write a check to change that. Fortunately the average quality is going up. Mo Ibrahim tracks this in a great way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8ddcgi?context=3)

DAE SWEDEN?!?!

* [Vaccines are very important in all countries. Some of the bad rumors have lead to kids dying of measles and pertussis.

4 golds for our friENT Bill Gates.



I definitely want to be clear that this is not about Bill Gates.  It's about reddit gold.  I am just constantly astonished that so many people give it out.  Bill Gates probably doesn't even know what it is

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17bhk0/a_survey_in_france_published_this_week_revealed/) on worldnews we have another fine example.

If it's about France

The first comments critices the study for being made online

This comment  [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17bhk0/a_survey_in_france_published_this_week_revealed/c84526x) is high quality and explains other findings that  this study had and also this one:

&gt; You also see a great difference on eduction

Which gets shouted down

&gt; People with low education are the ones competing for jobs with immigrants. People with high education generally live in upper class area's and don't have to deal with immigrants.

[We also do have the ""Islam-is-not-a-race -argument""](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17bhk0/a_survey_in_france_published_this_week_revealed/c843e4b)

&gt; I kind of see it this way. Americans have no real understanding of how small France is as a country. Some people talk about driving out of their home state on a vacation. You driving out of your home state is like crossing the entire country of France.

France literally is not a country with over 60 million people! God damn it

&gt; **You won't see bands of muslims walking through the neighborhoods and cities threatening women telling them to cover up etc like you now see in the UK and France.** Probably some of these fundies exist in the US no doubt. But they probably rightfully realize they'd be heading into a beating or **lynching** for doing so in some parts

TIL Europe is literally Iran and I wear rose-colored glasses when I visited my neighbor countries and my own and I just couldn't see all those Muslims forcing women to cover up. Best part about this comment? It sits on +390.

I also like this very ignorant world view

&gt; Because ""muslim holy lands"" are shitholes because of the extreme islamic culture. THey haven't seemed to realize that they cause the problems in their countries

.

&gt; There are too many Africans in France

&gt; Apart from the Africans who are well integrated and have jobs and act socially appropriate... (they are more than welcome) there are many who just hang around the metro, hang around in gangs and make visitors feel unsafe.

&gt; I hate low class black ghettoculture people

DAE hate niggers????! at +99

&gt; Unchecked immigration is not a good thing.

&gt; History shows that and common sense shows that.

&gt; Now

At +143. What parts in history have shown that? I wonder how the US would be if the founding fathers implemented anti-immigration policicies... Also how do deal with them? That's easy

And here comes r/atheism:

&gt; Islam isn't really all that compatible with most modern societies. To be fair

+103

&gt; Islam isn't compatible with anything that isn't Islam. It's like the Microsoft of religions. 

+35

&gt; Islam is not compatible with any civilized society. They are a mafia. A movement of the psychotic. A mental illness. 

+4

So I give up. Enough wading through shit. It's funny how on par with the Republitards Reddit is on immigration issues. I guess the indebt analyzes will not go very deep and stop on the fact that Redditors never had to immigrate to anywhere or having to adapt to a complete new culture that largely harbors xenophobia. From this high horse it's very easy to play the arm chair society expert.

&gt;See, is set your child up for a life time of correcting people. 

This is essentially the crux of the circlejerk. ""The child will have people ask how to pronounce their name/it's selfish"". Who cares? Name your kid whatever you want. Name your kid Jim. Name your Jyme. Let's keep in mind here also that the girl this commenter is ranting upon hasn't good a weirdly-spelt unique name for the hell of it, is actually complaining about his hard-to-pronounce surname, which if you're keeping track is the the name that *nobody actually chooses for their child.* 

But back to the white-people names like Jaylee and Cyndee or Heath (which actually seems like a pretty mainstream name to be it always is listed as an example) - there is an incredibly amount of hate for these. I don't know if this is a form of classism against what is percieved as ""white trash""

1357019968.0,15rfi8,VIDEO GAME WITH DINOSAURS MAKE IT HAPPEN! - I'll take my karma in a lump sum.,New_Wav,110,17,46,"/r/gaming has been on a karma kick ever since 4chan made a thread to fuck with Activision over how more video games need dinosaurs. The cultured video game elitist over at /r/gaming have had their foot on the gas of that karma train since it was spawned and haven't eased up on the throttle since.

The joke of all games needing more dinosaurs has been around for a while. We saw it a lot with people saying Battlefield 3 needed dinosaurs and everybody went fucking bonkers when the cool dudes over at DICE managed to sneak a reference to that joke into the game. Actual dinosaurs were never actually added to the game. Much to ~~everyone's~~ a small group of peoples disappointment.

The jerk however presses on. ""Skyrim had mammoths and dragons

Well the latest popular open world game to hit the market is Far Cry 3 and guess what people think should be added to that game? You guessed it

In one day you've had 2 post break a few hundred Karma saying that Far Cry 3 needs some dinosaurs.

How original of you /r/gaming users. You've once again re-hashed an idea/joke that 4chan came up with into yet another game via some less than creative photoshop projects. Good job

The comments are filled with some higher up responses that bring some reason into it all saying ""We need to make a dinosaur games general."" or ""So why don't you play Turok?"" or ""You know dinosaur D-Day exist right?""

But for the most part you get an assortment of comments like...

&gt; WANT!

or

&gt; I'm probably beating a dead horse here

Or 

&gt; and have the game be somewhat hard[challenging for the players]

Or 

&gt; How long have gamers wanted an open world jungle game with dinosaurs? I feel like its been 30 years. How has this not been done yet.

Or 

&gt; I would play this game INDEFINITELY.

Or 

&gt; More dinosaur games in general!

So yeah the comments agree, EA and even our lord and savior developer Valve are asleep at the wheel.

Gaming industry get your shit together. 2000+ people on an internet forum said they have a mild interest in a game idea. Make that damn game!

 Disregard the fact that this community has a high propensity to piracy and that if you know anything about marketing(which EA and company do) only X percent of people who say their interested in something will buy it.

 Also completely disregard the fact that the game is likely

Interestingly enough the comments touch on another thing. How Ubisoft fucking sucks because they don't offer mod support and that is a hindrance to the development of a game like this and many others. So really it is just an excuse to more so point out how gaming companies should allow more mod support in general.

&gt; Seriously! Ubisoft should release modding tools

and

&gt; Ubisoft...allowing mod support? That'll be the day.

and

&gt; This is how they should actually make games. Take a good game, graphics, ect.) I would definitely play Starwars Battlefield.

So yeah Ubisoft

Lacking mod support does kind of suck but don't use it as a reason to hate a company because some secret agenda stops a game you want from existing simply because it doesn't offer mod support. There are more factors than that. Lets put our thinking caps on and take a good long look at what it takes to make a game good

I conclusions /r/gaming beats the dead horse yet again by injecting Dinosaurs into yet another modern game. We know this

They then go on to show they don't always think, they are what matters. No other larger market demographics and past experiences could possibly influence what the entertainment industry makes or doesn't make. They, the piracy empire themselves, will buy enough copies of a game to make it profitable for *X developer* if *they(reddit and /r/gaming as a collection)* think it is a good idea. 

Fuck everyone else they don't know what is good for gaming. We do, you offer mod support, the sun is up, my headband isn't too tight, the price is under $20, my thermostat is set to a comfortable 19.4444 degrees celcious, it offers Steamworks, free DLC

Anyway, have been held in Greece without bail for over 70 days, without any conclusion in sight. Something may well be wrong here - at the very least, it's a somewhat interesting situation, I guess, if you personally follow these guys (which no one does, until it's karma-lucrative to do so).

So, the level-headed netizens of r/games make sure to jump to the quickest conclusions they possible can, and obviously that is that FUCK GREECE. 

Some parent comments:

&gt;Greece why are you being such a dick lately?

Top comment. Whatever. Generates pun-related jokes and a vague attempt at a dialogue

&gt; This is simply sad

Except not every tourist works for a company that makes military simulators for other countries

&gt;Isn't this borderline human rights violation? 70 days in a holding cell with shit conditions, and I am going to assume the legal system is purposely dragging their feet.

Look - maybe 70 days in jail is excessive for this. Maybe. Who fucking knows? Not me. And not you. ~~Human rights violation? What the fuck? There are people being bombed to pieces, a criminal is being detained in a country with is going through tumultuous change! I mean - not a criminal - just someone who, you know, harmlessly committed a crime! I mean - no, wait... He's just a tourist!~~ (Edited: This is something of a moot point and not something I would actually use in an argument. People have pointed out that this not a flawed perspective, and I don't want this one point to distract anyone from the rest of the post.)

&gt; Alright

Blah blah blah, it's totally useless to blame Greece in this situation. It's like when something happens in some tiny claims court or some backwater jail or some single person does something in America, and everyone goes FUCK AMERICA. There are two ways to approach an issue: the productive way, and the way where you boil everything down to a good guy (the criminal), and a bad guy (an entire country).

&gt; I'm sorry

It wouldn't be r/games without international politics.

&gt; Greece is such a shit hole of a country

Etc...

It's a somewhat tricky issue because obviously, except their words are in another country over something no one has any information about in the first place. 

How do these people just leap on conclusions like they do? Why would you automatically side with the alleged criminal in a situation? Just because thousands of tourists each year might accidentally take pictures of a military installation, if nothing else, an *unclear* issue? Grey, even?

Under the first parent comment is where you get a back-and-forth dialogue, and see how, surprise, it goes nowhere - one person presents the snippet of information they heard from one biased source, another presents the snippet of information they heard from another biased source, and everyone goes on 'bating over their outrage at Greece. 

Yes, ""nowhere should this justify being held for over two months with no bail and no trial date. If they are found guilty of a crime, then they should serve a sentence. First, they need to be given a trial."" I agree, in theory - but there's a big, real world out there, and frankly, real world works on a day-to-day basis

When someone mentions that maybe the dev's photographs actually constitute a security risk, like a country that isn't the USA has no reason to have a military or protect its secrets. It betrays a total lack of understanding of the subtleties of the regional politics, particularly, in this case, with neighboring Turkey... but whatever.

If he did pull up, the ground was right above his head, and he would not inadvertently pull the airplane “up” into it. If he pulled up, it was because he felt the inverted stall, and pulled just a bit to lower the angle of attack so as to un-stall.

[One comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gv4bc/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caoghec) even talks about how Bob Hoover’s seat came unbolted once while he was inverted and “he remembered to push the stick to gain altitude”, you don’t think through a series of rules to formulate the correct input: You just push the airplane away from the ground. (And if you push too hard and stall, then you pull back just a little to un-stall). There is no “remembering”, you feel the airplane and you command it accordingly. In any case... I really am insulted on behalf of the pilot if people are writing to say that he messed up the recovery:

&gt;[...you can see the elevator move in the opposite direction a pilot would move it in order to recover from that kind of situation](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caocmqd)

&gt;[She was basically a spoiler destroying the lift...](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/caoalb0)

No, and while she was generating weight and drag, she was probably not deflecting air upwards enough to deflect lift. If she did, she would be pushed down into the wing by pretty strong forces.

And then there are a bunch of commenters who don't even know what a stall looks like

&gt;[This really does not look to me like a stall. It seems to me that the aircraft would have wavered a bit before going in if that were the case.](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/cap611f)

Nope, not all at once. (For example, most airplanes set the inboard part of the wing at a higher angle of incidence than the tips, so that the inboard areas stall first, but the tips keep flying - which is where the ailerons are, the movable surfaces that control rolling). But in an old biplane, or in a modern aerobatic airplane, then stall the wing(s) on one side but not on the other

&gt;[Other folks keep talking about stalling - there's no sign of a stall from the way that airplane was performing.](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/cao5xbv)

1366167228.0,1cib4n,TIL people are not perfect,ike38000,120,33,93,"One thing I have noticed about reddit’s desire to feel superior is that they need to find faults in people who are usually considered prime examples of excellent human beings who had a beneficial effect on humanity as a whole. I will be sticking to TIL posts here but I am sure there are many better examples.

**Gandhi** The most upvoted TIL post when one searches for “Gandhi” is titled [Gandhi used to sleep naked next to young Indian girls in order to test his resolve to chastity](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10rvqm/til_that_gandhi_used_to_sleep_naked_next_to_young/)

The comments are fairly full of [jokes about his resolve breaking](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10rvqm/til_that_gandhi_used_to_sleep_naked_next_to_young/c6g8i2h) though there is no actual evidence in the article to suggest that any such thing occurred. One commenter also points out the article may be somewhat untrustworthy given that [the author doubts the link between HIV and AIDS](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10rvqm/til_that_gandhi_used_to_sleep_naked_next_to_young/c6g9hfi).

**Martin Luther King Jr.** You need look a touch lower to find the bad information on MLK. It takes until the 5th highest rated post

Though the first comment attributes it to his time and occupation the two top comments with 562 and 81 points claim that his time period does not count as an excuse. Now that may be true but it is important to realize that it was not until 1973 that even the APA stopped considering homosexuality a mental disorder

**Harvey Milk** The third highest rated TIL relating to Harvey Milk [talks about him defending Jim Jones of Jonestown](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/18alkw/til_nine_months_before_the_jonestown_massacre_gay/) Only seven comments on this one however so not much there.

**Mother Teresa** The top post is about her [withholding painkillers from her patients](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b1ft3/til_that_mother_teresa_believed_suffering_brought/) Dispite the fact that [the top comment provides a strong arguement](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b1ft3/til_that_mother_teresa_believed_suffering_brought/c92r8ga) which says that it is actually a lie.

The second post appears to come from r/atheism and was nicely covered [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/19l3f0/the_antimother_teresa_jerk_returns_with_a/)

The 5th article then talks about how she [once thought AIDS was retribution for improper sexual conduct](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1bnbxm/til_mother_teresa_once_suggested_that_aids_might/) from which the top comment is [the Penn and Teller episode which seems to come up whenever any mention of her appears.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc732uzUkw4)


**John Lennon** Though certainly not as notable as some of the above figures John Lennon is usually seen as a pretty good guy however the most relevant and 7th top rated post declares that [he was not at all peaceful and beat his first wife](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ue8u5/til_that_john_lennon_was_not_as_peaceful_of_a_man/?sort=top) The top comment restates the title then proceeds to devolve into beatles lyrics. The second comment also attacks him but for a materialistic lifestyle.

Cuccinelli's office argues further that the Lawrence decision doesn't render sodomy laws unconstitutional in all situations and that it is constitutional to apply the law in this situation because it involves a minor.

&gt;Diamonds are not rare. Diamond prices have been artificially inflated by Debeers for over 100 years.

&gt;Supply has always been controlled tightly by De Beers to make the world think diamonds are rare.

-

&gt;I was wondering if the DeBeer defenders would hop in here. Good to know.
As for ""more than a decade ago"", resulting in a settlement arrangement totalling $295 million USD. De Beers does not admit liability.

The circlejerk is over stereotypes. I would repeatedly make pieces of art and put them up for critique. The classes would always have a handful of people who were bullshitters. People who'd spend less than an hour on a piece and just wing it, especially if you were quiet or distant, you could literally take your preliminary sketches, unfinished, unresolved, put them up for critique and people would praise you. If you were gay then it was game over. You were loved, you needed our support and everything you made would be gold, you're probably drawing women because you're a misogynist

This bullshit became very apparent to me when I decided to try such a device and to make a piece explaining that I was synesthetic and Jewish.

My teacher started to seem like he genuinely cared about my opinion. It wasn't because I had spent 10+ hours painting or sculpting, it was because it helped put me into a new box, one that people could quickly digest because they felt like I had something to offer them, some sort of pity they could give me to resolve their own guilt, so that they wouldn't be labeled as oppressive, people don't judge your work based on whether or not you fit into a artistic stereotype, but it's not completely gone and the bullshit is known to be bullshit.

r/art has a nasty habit of over critiquing pieces that seem amateur. That use colored pencils instead of oil paints. Drug art gets railed. Hyper realism is trying too hard. If you're influenced by something pop culture and you're not critiquing it, I don't imagine that everyone here is going to see this the same way I do, some people genuinely may find this piece to be very very interesting, but I can't help but see that this is all a charade, that people are completely looking past the actual art presented and are being overwhelmed by the context that this person is 'unique' and has a different way of seeing things and therefore this person's art matters. http://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/wuwlj/i_have_synesthesia_and_this_is_how_sweet_child_o/

The writer of the article disabled the comments section and then asked for the discussion to take place somewhere else 

Full text here: 
&gt;The comments are off on this post. This is a reference post, my email address is at the top of this page, where your remarks will receive an audience of one. So please do use it. I will read and consider everything. (from the article itself)

This is the crux of this CB post isn't it? 

But sadly its overshadowed by captain I know how to run a fucking website

&gt;""The article is belligerent, only serves to create a platform for lectures.
This guy is pretty misguidedly attacking an entire community of people

Don't be fooled because the article is none of these things. Rockpapershotgun is not ""creating a platform for lectures"" they just write about the gaming industry and pretty much everything about it. Hell a good part of the article is about a Machinima Prime youtube video that was even bashed on reddit as being horrible.

&gt;""Yes, comments are closed. So I guess this is John Walker saying he knows best and everyone disagrees with him is wrong?

Sensationalist blogging piece? This article is actually pointing out and discussing legitimate problems. At no point does he say whoever disagrees is wrong and once again

&gt;""""What was wrong with having a website about indie and PC games? Why does this kind of filthy idiotic person feel the need to infest every platform?""
Uh. You do realize that the piece's author, he's been there since day one.""

That. and the fact that this isn't some ""pro-censorship"" article. This is just reinforcing the notion that no one is actually reading the article that comments like this.

I'm not really sure how to end this because the comments in the young thread itself are trying their darndest to fight this kind of idea. 

Maybe schools need to teach reading comprehension better or perhaps encourage reading at all? I don't know. Maybe this kind of article and the comments section being closed just angers people a little too much. What do you fellas think?


Well shit it got even better.

&gt;This bugs me. I agree with everything this article says, but then claims that every dissenting perspective is 'an attempt to silence discussion.' We've talked about how great it is that we're seriously discussing this issue, but then gotten angry when people who don't already agree with us join the discussion.
It's this bizarre them vs us mentality. Character designers who enjoy oversexualization, they're the enemy. They're people who are wrong and we need to do something about them, rather than their opinions, outlooks or actions. This argument isn't ""we try to convince/educate the industry,"" it's ""we're fighting the industry."" It's not ""Women try to get rid of damaging tropes in the media"" It's ""Tropes vs Women""- though more often framed as ""Writers vs Women""
Besides that, and then just sorta... rants. There's no attempt to win over the hostile audience it acknowledges exists, in fact it just sorta yells at that audience. Were it not for that pastebin deflection, I would be tempted to call it linkbait, simply because it isn't actually adding anything to the conversation besides a bit more of that nice, alienating outrage.
It's not persuasive
Edit; I acknowledge that the article also calls out this sort of response- according to them claiming that both sides are guilty of hyperbole doesn't add anything. I don't find that claim agreeable

It doesn't add anything? Maybe to you? I think its an insult to dismiss this entire article as just someone being mad on the internet. Once again the whole not reading thing but at least they're trying to discuss something.

&gt;It's bad. Well
Some neckbeard saying ""LOL NO GURLS ON THE INTERNET"" shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone. You know

In a rare
&gt;I'm just going to say it: Shooting at those ladies in that truck makes me suspect that the LA police wan't to silence Chris Dorner for sone reason or another.

I KNOW I'LL GET DOWNVOTED BUT DAE AGREE WITH THE MURDERER???

Ignoring the obvious grammar malfunction (which he corrects in the description)
&gt;I tend to be pro-police and pro-military, 2 people, etc. And they did it twice. ""Kill him before he talks.""

We see he uses the old reddit trick of ""I'm usually not part of the circlejerk group but today I am"" to gain karma and make his post sound reasonable. Its has nothing about how this man is obviously a murderer on the loose in one of the most population dense areas of the country
&gt;You're a fool if you still have the childish belief that all police officers are good

Same basic point as the comment its replying to
&gt;This.
TL;DR: The LAPD is acting like a gang.
Their explanation was that a lookout car radioed a suspicious looking vehicle that matched the description of Dorner's was moving towards them. The cops saw the truck slow down several times and it did not have its headlights on.
Protip: It was slowing down to throw a newspaper to the door.
A number of officers on a protective detail (unnamed individual from Dorner's manifesto) opened fire on the truck. You can see in the picture
ಠ_ಠ
How on earth does this not look like an attempt to gun down Dorner?
I get it. He's allegedly murdered 3 people (2 civies and a cop) and injured another (also a cop) but opening fire on a truck like that? Gangs do that. Not cops.

Reddit believes that ALL cops are gangs and he uses as many memes as he can to prove his point.

The reason for this post, which is the blatant use of the [tu quoque fallacy](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) in order to dismiss CNN and various news outlets' claim that reddit dun goofed. Apparently, if you make a mistake, you can't blame other people for making the same mistake. Except, of course, if you're reddit, in which case you can blame anyone you want because ""reddit is just a collective of people"", but they are users unified under one website and largely share the same views. You would think these people would have more tact than to avoid accusations by shifting the blame to others

A good example of the use of logical fallacies to dodge accusations comes in [this thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csxi6/cnn_reporter_states_reddit_not_a_reliable_news/) about CNN calling reddit ""an unreliable news source"". The brave OP chimes in with some of the most insightful commentary I've seen all week:

&gt;So watching CNN this morning, and therefore knew LONG before CNN reported that he was in a boat and knew BEFORE cnn reported that he was captured. So... who's a better news source? The people listening to the scanners... or the CNN reporters blocks away? REDDIT WINS EVERY TIME!

Reddit wins every time, as long as you're the first one on the scene with the musings of the police on the scanner, that's better journalism than what CNN or other news outlets do. Why wait for the truth when you can just get hearsay and speculation much quicker? 

While the comments do a good job of pointing out that reddit indeed messed up, you can shift the blame to someone else, always! Do something great? We did it reddit! Do something bad? Well, we're not all the same person, you know?

In [this thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1csy2x/cnn_partially_blames_reddit_for_boston_bombing/)

&gt;You mean you're not supposed to take the information you find and instantly release it without checking it? Is that the lesson you'd like us to learn

&gt;Do as they say

Yeah, first. Karma takes a backseat to integrity, right? Right, guys? Guys?

Another comment comes up [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1csy2x/cnn_partially_blames_reddit_for_boston_bombing/c9jqs3k) that I feel tries to shift the blame away from reddit by claiming it's not a news outlet

&gt; I was watching Jon Stewart's appearance on Crossfire and they were talking about the difference between Comedy Central and CNN. Stewart noted that there is a degree of responsibility that exists for CNN but not Comedy Central.

&gt;I think that goes for Reddit as well. Reddit is not morally responsible to be right. CNN has the moral responsibility of sound journalism to be a reputable source of facts. So to hold Reddit to the same standards as a national media network such as CNN would be irresponsible at best.

I feel like if you want to act like a journalist/detective/FBI agent/whatever

In closing, I experienced some of the same things when Dorner was still a thing and /r/DornerCase was a bastion of logic and facts. I only hope that news outlets continue to call out reddit for their role in the spread of misinformation. It needs to be known that this site is unreliable when it comes to news reporting and making a play-by-play of every minute and worthless detail is not worthy of a Peabody Award or any kind of prize. It's not journalism, it's not how news should work. I honestly am fed up with people praising this site every time they mess up because they're too sheltered to realize what journalism is. I can only hope these armchair detectives and pretend FBI agents learn from their mistakes and never do anything like this again. They had a large role in potentially ruining two people's lives: Sunil and Mike. If anything, they deserve an apology, not redditors patting themselves on the back for a job well done.

To be fair

&gt;If you can't feed em don't breed em

Le Human Husbandry 101

&gt;I think the world might be a better place if people stopped viewing it as the right to have children and viewed it as a privilege. My job brings me in to contact with poor parenting everyday. Some parents seem to have had children and then lost interest in actually bringing them up.

""Let me use my anecdotal STEM experience to tell you how to use your uterus.""

&gt;I heard an interesting speech on NPR yesterday. The speaker drew an analogy between people on Earth and bacteria in a test tube.

Humans. Bacteria. Do we honestly need to see what the analogy was? At least it came from NPR!

Speaking of analogies

&gt;If a single-father with no other family is convicted of heinous murder
No, sometimes those steps--like putting the child into foster-care--are tragic, but the alternatives are usually as-bad-or-worse. The parents' own actions have created a shitty situation, and the question for society-at-large is how to find the least-bad outcome.
That's not even getting into the cases where the parent is simply being abusive in terms of shifting all negative outcomes onto the child, I'll make sure my child feels the pain first, and you wouldn't hurt a child, now would you?"")

Heinous murder=fathering more children than I find socially optimal.

&gt;When society is configured so that children are a collective responsibility and everyone (by force of law) bears the burden of providing the welfare for all... Then society will HAVE to ultimately dictate permissible procreation practices in order to flourish. The number of matters that can be kept private or decided by the will of a single person will shrink and shrink when allocation of ""public"" resources is constantly at stake.

""I'm adovacting for government run population control

There's plenty of dissent in this thread but not much discomfort with the notion that *how many children you choose to have* is somehow not an inalienable right. It's symptomatic of a common theme in Reddit's ""liberal"" hivemind:

Try to say you can't actually get arrested for this sort of thing

Not only that

Here is OP answering the question ""You can get arrested for that?""

&gt; Depends on whether or not an overly-sensitive parent sees you take them in or not. Some (usually women) flip out when they see a man take a child into a restroom

Apparently the matter of arrest or not arrest depends on the presence of overly-sensitive parents.  Yep

For people who don't want to read or don't know what's going on the Tor network is basically a ""second"" internet. Only certain websites can be accessed through a special browser, and child (p)0rn0graphy. Which I will now call CP cause I don't feel like being a on watch list. Not all of the Tor network is bad, but to be honest I don't know many uses for it. Well the FBI just busted this network and closed down quite a few sites.

I am so glad the responses are totally supportive of the CP bust and Reddit is buying pizza for the FBI. 

MAJOR EDIT: fuck normal editing procedure this one is going to the top. Here is one of the top 5 comments

&gt;People are missing the point here. They're disguising it as a ""protect the children"" thing
Let's put it this way. If no CP sites, suddenly many people are behind the FBI's actions.
They're tricking you into supporting them.
Edit: It's also about crashing Bitcoin. The government and banks are terrified of a currency that they cannot control. They want it dead

1372881926.0,1hl78p,r/AdviceAnimals' gamers all share one image of a non-gamer,smogless_sunset,114,31,79,"In the early afternoons, entitled ""[To those who give me shit for playing video games at 25.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/)"" 

Now, the second amendment and ""men's rights""?) I was fascinated to discover that redditors who feel persecuted for playing video games can only conceive of three characteristics that adult non-gamers share: 1) less money, 2) serious bar habits and 3) a fondness for worthless television.

For the sake of completeness, but cumulatively, the effect is just a long list of redditors' ages, which is a silly and frivolous discussion. 

Let's move on.

The most prominent of the non-gamer jerks asserted that the only alternative to playing games is gettin' hammered:

&gt; I'm going to be playing videogames til I'm 80. Id take Enjoying an interactive story rather than getting shitfaced at a bar any day [+36](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav1wei)

which begets a subjerk

&gt; This! When I was in the Marines I was harassed because I would stay in the Barracks and play video games in my off time

and small fry like

&gt;You couldn't have said it any better. I'm almost 30 and I spend my money on games rather than dropping $80- 100 bucks at the bar in a single night. [+1](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav7wnc)

&gt;Even if you buy a new release

&gt;I bet most of the people giving you shit spend $60 a night drinking too. [+1](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav602i)

&gt;""Dude

But enough of that; let's look at *Section III: The Only Other Activity in the World is Watching TV*

&gt;My wife and I are 40 and we love playing video games together. The same people who bug you about playing games likely watch three hours of reality TV per day. And read People magazine. [+27](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav0mtx)

&gt;It's usually the ones who are obsessed with sport or some other sort of GAME who make comments such as ""aren't you too old for games"" or ""you play halo
Then they go off and cry because their team dropped a ball
I have never understood this world or the creatures in it. [+8](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav1myb)

&gt;There are some people I know that kinda have the same attitude OP describes. I have a buddy who is unemployed and just watches tv all day. I suggested to him get gfx card for your pc and play some games with us from time to time. His reply

&gt;People don't realize how much tv they watch. I can look on steam and see how many hours I've played games and I can guarantee its lets time than most spend watching shit tv. [+3](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav4r1v) (says a user whose name is literally ""tvreference"")

&gt;Growing up

&gt;I usually ask people how its any different than watching TV. That usually shuts them up. Hell video games are better. At least they challenge you and require some mental function. [+3](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav25c6)

&gt;These are the same people who either
1. Obsess over fantasy sports
2. Obsess over their kids to the point you block them
3. Follow celebrities and read gossip sites constantly
4. Whine about how bad this generation is
5. Watch reality shows constantly
6. All the above [+2](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav1vb6)

So, I can't say whether or not that actually happens, but the only thing it sounds like to me is high school.

And this is neither here nor there, but a $500 console with $60 games plus subscriptions and extra hardware and a tv to plug it into certainly sounds more expensive than the 3 hours of $4 shot and beer combos I'm going to put in at the local dive this weekend. 

So here is the Big Question: where are the people saying all the stuff these gamers say they hear so often?

I see one allegation of [manchildism](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav2vbd), and I see nobody saying anything about bars or TV being better.

I guess it's possible that, but this jerk is so monotonous and echoey, even in the lack of an opposing opinion, that I prefer to believe that this is the specter of people ragging on video game players, conjured up by none other than the players themselves.

Bonus points for a post hitting all three jerks:
&gt; I get crap from people sometimes because I'll spend a few hours on a game, but I'd rather grab a 6 pack on my own, sit in front of the PC and shoot noobs in the face, than go to a loud bar where I'll spend a lot of money and get nothing out of it but a headache.

OP links to a Twitter screenshot of this insightful tweet:

&gt;don't understand why dogs aren't allowed in most places but children are. [+1154]

Let's speculate

&gt;I've come to wonder this while looking for apartments. Our deposit goes up by $500 for our one, 5 year old dog. Yet the couple viewing the place after us has no additional deposit for their two toddlers. My brothers house has been absolutely destroyed by his 2 kids, while my year long lease ends tomorrow with absolutely no damage attributed to my dog or otherwise. [+47]

Or... maybe not.

&gt;Because animals are ""dirty disease carrying shredders"". [+20]

&gt;I think that definition applies at least as equally to children? ; ) [+10]

Should I just stop now?

&gt;Health codes. [+9]

&gt;Hard to believe children are somehow healthier than people's dogs. I'd gladly pet someone's dog long before I'd even pay their child. [+13]

&gt;Most of us feel that Brawl was a giant step backwards competitively and prefer Melee as the better game. +8

So right off the bat, and putting in forth in a demeaning and somewhat narrow-minded way. He also presents his opinion as the truth by saying that his opinion is shared by ""most of us"", not bothering to check the number of entrants at events that are equally Melee and Brawl focused, such as Apex (32 pools of around 10-11 for each game -- couldn't find the exact number of entrants). Although it is true that Melee is the game currently in the running for EVO, the Brawl community has gotten, to a greater or lesser extent, behind Melee, which are all perfectly valid points

Later on in the comments

&gt;Combos in the traditional sense of the term are essentially non-existent in Brawl because of the extremely slow physics

&gt;Infinite grabs are kind of their own thing

Combos are a staple of most fighting games, as opposed to having 0 to death combos like it seems people in the thread want, is a perfectly valid system. Also, he calls infinites not combos, which confuses me. The definition he provides, which is from Wikipedia, is:

&gt;In video games, that yield a significant benefit or advantage.

Well, he is admitting that there are combos in Brawl, thereby rendering his whole argument kind of moot.

Someone else posted:

&gt;Brawl is in many cases the opposite: it is deep in a horizontal sense. It's a wonderful celebration of all things Nintendo, and items, and you've got Brawl. While the outer layer of Brawl's onion is vast and aesthetically pleasing, the gameplay at its core is unbalanced and shallow. As gamers peel away Brawl's layers, they realize there is little to be found beyond the superficial.

Wut.

Players defending Brawl also got downvoted

&gt;Infinites are not combos

(which is in direct contrast to Wikipedia again; same author)

and

&gt;Almost all of Brawl's combos are really cheesy, and chain grabs. Melee's combos are legit and improvisational in nature.

are at +6 and +7 respectively. This comment

&gt;Brawl does have real combos.

linking to 9b vs. ADHD (a match exemplifying 9B's amazing grab game)

This sort of thing happens in other threads

&gt;That was one of the most boring things I have ever watched in my life +18

and

&gt;Man

The thread [""Why is Melee superior?""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/11eozy/why_is_melee_superior/) (just look at the title) from a while ago has intelligent discussion such as:

&gt;melee is a lot more balanced than brawl fox vs fox on final destination almost NEVERRRRRR happens in competitive melee play nowadays. that whole thing was a giant misconception by a bunch of dumb cocksuckers who like to spread their own ignorance. +13

and

&gt;Brawl is slow bullshit

The thread [""FACT: Melee is NOT more competitive than Brawl""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/10vevx/fact_melee_is_not_more_competitive_than_brawl/) (yes

&gt;Wrong. Melee is both more technical and more competitive. Firstly, the community is much smaller, but the game itself is by far the most complex fighting game ever. If Brawl is Checkers, Melee is Chess. You simply can't tell me that Chess isn't more competitive than Checkers. I'm not saying anyone can pick up Brawl and be great, but the years it takes to get very good at Melee is the difference. The strategies combined with the technical skill, and the speed at which it all unfolds is what makes Melee that much harder to master. +10

and

&gt;expect P:M to do better then smash 4 because Sakurai is just going to remake brawl with a couple new levels and a character or 2. i believe its now up to the community to make the game good not sakurai. Only +2 but then again no downvotes.

I stopped discussing the last comments because I think they speak for themselves. most of the examples I took were of people defending Melee mainly because I think that is far more common in the subreddit than the opposite. Then again

&gt;This truly is one of the best pieces of sarcasm I have ever seen. I can't conceive of a better way to portray this whole Muslims-going-fucking-bazerk-over-whatever-the-fuck issue. Huge thumbs up for The Onion for the amount of genius displayed in this article. Just WOW.

First of all, you'd think they'd catch that. Then there's the Muslim hate speech, then he calls it a work of 'genius'. I'll have to disagree, this is a decent work of satire, but I've seen the onion do much better: http://www.theonion.com/articles/obama-help-us-destroy-jesus-and-start-a-new-age-of,29478/

Maybe it's just another day on /r/WTF. Well

Seeing the piece in it's exhibition, is absolutely integral to understanding the piece. A few weeks ago another redditor posted a 320 square pixel jpeg of a [Joan Miro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3) that was ridiculed for being sold for millions of dollars. As I had just seen a wonderful Miro exhibit

The responses in these threads often follow very similar patterns, only a person pretending to be intelligent would find something I don't appreciate cool, right? [Here is](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xrh3p) a comment combining BOTH of these comments into one judgmental pile of butt, including the implication that artist and hipster are synonyms. And [here is](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xs5ar) a comment implying that anyone who appreciates unorthodox art is a drug addict or a freak.

Then there's the [painting modern art lovers as condescending jerks](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xreuu ). This one I find ironic

Lastly

So why is this jerk so successful? Every modern/contemporary art post on main reddit is so full of scorn and smugness that I find it mind boggling. Well the central theme of these comments seems to be that redditors (generally a very technically oriented and single minded bunch) are afraid of 'art lovers' pulling a fast one on them. So they seek to justify their lack of understanding or interest in this material by mocking the people who do appreciate it or even the industry as whole. After all, and thus must discredit the whole industry. I wonder why redditors don't feel comfortable simply saying *I do not find this piece of art valuable or interesting*. I think it stems from a lack of art education or exposure to a variety of contemporary and modern art. After all, if I don't know about it, it must not be worth knowing about, right?

Can you guess Reddit's reaction? They defend him. They think that because black people call each other ""nigga"" - *they* should be able to say the word too. Many even go as far to claim that it is racism to not allow white people to say it

Neckbeard Eleid writes this: 

&gt;You know what

What bravery. Notice the tone he uses? ""Shouldn't be tolerated""

&gt;Not ""oh this argument again""

**Wow**. Did you guys see that? This Neckbeard is calling it *racist* to be upset by white people calling black people niggers. **That's** the racist part? What a fucking smug idiot. 

And you want to know the scary part? **This guy is being heavily upvoted**. 

I've seen this kind of rhetoric spewed all over Reddit time and time again. Neckbeards are incapable of understanding social and racial context. There is a reason why black people can get away with calling each other niggas; it's because they share a specific history and culture wherein it is acceptable to do so. A white person doesn't have this tie - so it is therefore not acceptable to use the word in reference to a black person. 

I don't understand why the Neckbeards can't grasp this. Most of them (i'm guessing) are younger

Not everyone is equal and not everyone is free to communicate to others in equal ways. Double standards exist all over society and they exist for a reason. Language is entirely dependent on the context of the relationships of the communicators.

Ah, and game developers benefit from us neckbeards telling all of our friends to go buy your game!

&gt; This is true... I have been making this argument since the early 2000's. I remember when I was about 10 years younger and I liked to play around with photoshop.. the software was probably over $200 bucks... I know for a fact I wouldn't have been able to afford it(then).. so whether I pirated it or not.. it would have done Adobe no good. This same theory applies for music that I may have had a small interest in... If I didn't truly LOVE an artist I was not going to purchase the album.. If I liked it and decided to pirate it then that wouldn't have made any difference as far as the music industry goes either.

[[+30]](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1dcah8/97_of_game_dev_tycoon_players_pirated_the_game/c9p1oht)

Hear that, they benefit because I'll totally buy more of their albums later instead of pirating more. Everyone is owed a free trial on everything digital because, you know, it doesn't cost you anything to give it to me for free!

&gt; It's called cheap marketing. You upload a cracked version of your game to a torrent then contact a bunch of game news outlets with the catchy title that ""97% of game dev tycoon players pirated the game."" A few hours later
Pretty simple stuff...

Again, and... more people will go buy the game? BRB, E-mailing EA about this.

&gt;People who are considered mentally or physically retarded or otherwise genetically inferior should not be allowed to procreate.

Basically,

&gt; When a Libyan diplomat opened fire from the embassy window in London and killed officer Yvonne Fletcher


And the like. But more hilarious are all the Redditors who watched a bit too much James Bond and have come up with idiotic ways to get Assange out of the embassy. The two most common plans proposed are ""flash mobs"" (hint: they wouldn't be flash mobs):

&gt; Way to escape. Arrange with hundreds of trusted protesters to all dress i exactly the same hoodie and be on the streets in front of the building. Have 20/30 people from inside the building wearing the same hoodie run out all at the same time and blend in with crowd. Crowd disperses.


Yeah, they can, for causing a massive public disturbance. The cops can also do stuff like cordon off areas.

&gt; Here's an idea....flash mob call to dress in all black with an eyehole balaclava and arrive with someone else driving a car and who remains with their car parked anywhere...hundreds of people show up at the embassy...are led into the embassy on official invite...lights are turned off and Assange joins them under darkness in the room and with some loudish music playing...then everyone is told to all rush out of the embassy and run to their respective cars and race off back home.
diversion ... confusion ... obfuscation ... distraction ... he's taken to the coast
Edit: or he just remains in the embassy and we all watch while laughing our ass off!

Ugh. Open waters? ""Equiaorian vessels""?

&gt; The mob should slowly trickle into the building over a period of days. Eventually about 500 of them.
They all shave their heads, limp a little, etc) to foil canter recognition software. Others behave quite normally and don't wear any make-up at all. Some wear those big annoying looking sunglasses.
Simultaneously, also shaved. They rush towards the embassy as the other 500 rush out simultaneously. Everyone converges, mingles, runs and zig-zags.
300 or so pile into nearby cars that have been parked on the surrounding streets. Some leave alone
Another 300 or so remain lingering in the area waiting for a cue. Suddenly
Mind you
""If you support Assange, in Scotland and Wales. Shave your head, and go outside and mill about. Fly, my monkeys, fly!!""
Project Spartacus!


Ugh - fucking Spartacus? Really?
And helicopters. Yes


&gt; I've been thinking this for a while, drop down a ladder or something to Assange on the roof of the embassy, then fly him out over the channel either here to Ireland or to somewhere on the continent. They can deliver him to an airport, throw him on a plane, and drop him in Equador. Once outside of England, the British have no authority, and if there's a bird in the air with Assange on it, which would be an act of war


Yeah


&gt; I know this is far fetched, and he crawled up a ladder to the copter. And then it went for an airfield, where he could get into a plane. And literary didn't touch the ground of the English soil?
Could that be done in theory?
Don't worry

It could be done in theory

&gt; Assange is probably reading this.
Whats up Julian.
Helicopter Nigger.
International Waters.


Ugh.

Basically, he isn't protected. The ""flash mobbers"" causing a massive disturbance outside of the embassy aren't immune. Helicopters and airplanes would be flying through British airspace, and aren't immune. Airports aren't immune. You can't magically get a helicopter over the center of London without some sort of approval.

1373588193.0,1i4bii,Microsoft and the Death of the Tech Industry:Another NSA Circlejerk,Thyrotoxic,106,23,45,"[F]irst post be gentle ;)

I'm writing this mainly because I'm sick of all the uninformed bullshit that reddit is spouting as more and more of these leaks are uncovered. This is not going to really be about the NSA spying itself but more the fact that reddit is not as technologically competent as it thinks. I don't work in the tech industry but I do read a lot of tech news and tinker a lot with various devices so I generally know what I'm talking about. Reddit however does not. Let's dive into a post.

[Revealed: how Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages

&gt;The NSA has killed the US Tech Industry. Everyday there are more and more calls to stop using products and services of American companies.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0me7a

And so it begins with the top comment currently at +718. Yes that's right folks the US tech industry is now well and officially dead. You heard it here first. It doesn't matter that Google (the world's largest search engine and website), businesses and governments) are all US companies. They are now all dead. 

Surely somebody will come a tone down the hyperbole a little in a reply.

&gt;I've thought this from the beginning. While it sucks for the American public

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0pe4v

Nope. I was almost hopeful. The reply to this comment does have somebody with a few braincells still alive as they ask what are the alternatives.

&gt;Now we know why they are hunting Snowden. These corporations-government secret connections are the apex of greed

&gt;This is the culmination of political greed, like a crack addict crumbling over itself.

&gt;The only exit for trusting information technology again is the open-source, for private companies to trust it. Total transparency. And that might be the end for proprietary software companies.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0pnf0

Can't have an NSA thread without some conspiritards. This made me chuckle a lot. They're not stopping Snowden because he's leaking state secrets everywhere and embarrassing the US government immensely. They're not trying to stop him to ensure he doesn't fuck everything up a lot more. Nope

I love the last point involving open-source

Next we have a new jerk. XBone hate! We can't have a thread about Microsoft without mentioning XBone!

&gt;""Skype

&gt;So this will probably happen with Kinect on the Xbox One?

&gt;The Xbox One uses Skype.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0m9di

Followed by: 

&gt;The whole company is a fucking joke

 _

&gt;Microsoft: When Xbox One is on and you’re simply having a conversation in your living room

&gt;I very much doubt that. People need to realise the kinect is an NSA program for mass data collection

Yes the kinect is literally only there to collect data for the NSA. It's not a pretty cool little gadget expanding motion capture technology so one day we can do things hands free. It's only for the NSA to track us.

Fortunately somebody has realised just how stupid this statement is and corrected them.

Finally we have:

&gt;Yeah

They just assume nobody wants the pretty cool media centre functions and exclusive games.


Moving on to another top level reply.

&gt;I used to write games for the XBox360 and one of the TCRs for XBLA games is that you cannot do any encryption or compression on the voice chat data for online games. We could have compressed the crap out of them and saved a ton of bandwidth but I guess if we did that then the NSA would have to figure out the compression/encryption on each game.

Now I am not a programmer (I've dabbled) but I'm fairly sure they will want everybody using the same standard for voice chat so it isn't incredibly buggy when developers use their own home made chat functions

New top reply.

We have a guy, let alone on a US server that the NSA and MS is known to have backdoor access to. It's nice to be having some proper debate about this for once. Wait what's that? More hyperbole? Of course.

That's right, businesses and governments across the world. This ensures that it is also the most scutinised piece of software in the world. Thousands of security experts, hackers and government agencies have crawled over the OS with a fine-toothed comb and found nothing. If there was some kind of backdoor it would have been found.

&gt;How Can Any Company Ever Trust Microsoft Again? ""Microsoft consciously and regularly passes on information about how to break into its products to US agencies""

Linking to an /r/technology thread with an article of the same title. Something similar was posted in /r/technology a few days ago and it was mentioned by a lot of people (including me) that the reason MS gives early warning to security agencies about bugs in its software is to help them mitigate vulnerabilities. In fact they give it to [civilian security software vendors](https://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp.aspx#) and large companies too! But of course there's a conspiracy.

[r/WorldNews](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/) is home to a very similar situation. As many here know, apartheid fascists, and evil financiers of death and destruction. I've seen comments that look like they were ripped straight out of [*The Protocols of the Elders*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion).

&gt; Yes

&gt; I'm disgusted by how the main media doesn't bring that side of the story up

Yeah, you discount several articles that can be found on the websites of the BBC, CNN, CBS, Reuters, et cetera. People also love expecting downvotes from the Arab-lovers - downvotes that don't arrive.

&gt; The rockets have killed people now. These people couldn't make it to a bunker in time.

&gt; That's what you all wanted.

&gt; Do you give a shit now

Yeah

&gt; You validate Hamas' tactics. You are partly responsible for their deaths.

and...

&gt; i'm sure people will find a way to spin this against israel. the big evil aggressor destroying innocent missiles that just want to live in peace

and...

&gt; The Zionists put those buildings in the way of innocent

And it goes on and on.

Don't get me wrong - there are tons of the anti-Israeli assholes as well

1376040872.0,1k0mhj,A Subreddit-wide Jerk: An Analysis of TIL and discussion of how to accurately describe implicit jerks and jerks of omission,code_primate,102,18,28,"This post began as a planned comment to another CBer in a different thread

There are lots of jerks on Reddit. That's why we're here, when read plainly, true and seemingly uncontroversial, but something is definitely off. Sometimes it's when they congratulate each other for incredibly banal beliefs that one must wonder if they have actually deluded themselves into actually thinking their enemies are a goofily evil hyperbolic caricature. For example, something like ""Wow, the world would be so much better if we had more people like you who thought that people of all genders deserve equal rights,"" almost always implies that feminists actually want to subjugate men to achieve their goals, it is simply odd patterns in the frequency of posts. For example, one wonders why Reddit expresses such deep concern for male rape victims, Reddit's concern for male rape victims quickly starts to seem like concern trolling when one knows how vehemently they refute any mention of the well-documented male-on-female epidemic of sexual violence. (sorry to use 2 SJ examples. I know it's not open broke

I consider these previous paragraphs to be the beginnings of a discussion on reddit's jerks of omission and jerks of subtext. I have not fully considered the implications and would love to hear what you all have to say

TIL is poised to become one of the new worst of reddit subreddits. The thing is that the jerk is usually implicit. In TIL, mentions of things/people Reddit idolizing that rise on name recognition that appeal to people who already probably know the fact, and stories about ""badassery"". I venture that these categories make up &gt;85% of TIL. 

If you look at the top of TIL right now (and this is honestly amazing to me since I came up with 3/4 of my TIL categories off the top of my head before looking at the front page)

The [first link](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jz9xc/til_phil_hartman_you_may_remember_him_in_such/) combines both reddit's incessant pandering to fans of one of its favorite aspects of pop culture (Futurama), we get comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jz9xc/til_phil_hartman_you_may_remember_him_in_such/cbjwrth) (TL;DR, ""what a crazy b----"") as well as general jerking over how good he was by people who are obviously big fans and did not learn today about his death. It's tough to tell whether the ""crazy woman"" jerk or ""pop culture I like"" jerk contributed more to its success, and my categorization admittedly forces it to straddle at least two categories, but once again, it is hard to tell since much of the jerk is subtextual. 

The [second link](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jzweu/til_under_civil_forfeiture_police_departments_are/) is a straight up corrupt cop jerk. There have been interesting articles in the mainstream news about this very real issue

[Standard old school badass is third](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jzadv/til_us_marine_jack_lucas_survived_and_earned_the/)

[More jerking about against a political view](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jz498/til_companies_can_still_legally_fire_a_worker_for/) that, as equal protection has been the big quest for LGBT equality cases for years.

Fifth is a post where reddit [praises a cop murderer for trying to donate a pizza](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jyyxa/til_that_copkiller_philip_workman_declined_a_last/). I find this post extremely illustrative. Interestingly, but this is irrelevant. Why? We can reasonably assume from the 100-10-1 rule that most people did not read the comments. Yet people still upvoted the story based on a calculated portrayal of a ""cop-killer"" who tried to do a good deed but got shut down by the system. We don't need to get into any of the politics of capital punishment or the details of the evidence of this specific man's innocence to see that this is clearly part of the bizarre ""cop murderers are good/cops deserve to die"" jerk that has been full-force in the background since Dorner and occasionally resurfaces. To leave no doubt in your mind about this, the OP responds to [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jyyxa/til_that_copkiller_philip_workman_declined_a_last/cbjq2r3) comment with [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jyyxa/til_that_copkiller_philip_workman_declined_a_last/cbjua0x). I think what I am getting at here is that while we usually focus on jerks in the comments, the jerks implicit in the upvotes given to main submissions are also extremely powerful, and we have only scratched the surface of this phenomenon on CB. More on this later.

Moving along

[Seventh is a jerk against corporate America](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jyr77/til_gillette_and_schick_own_duracell_and/)

And below that you have mildly interesting things that lack the jerk power to propel them to the top of TIL

So I guess I'm trying to address three things with this post: Jerks through link posts, it doesn't matter since an entirely different group of people accept and upvote the sensationalized titles at face value! Upvoting a thinly-veiled political opinion in TIL is no less jerky than doing so for comments in /r/politics, although it has been extremely difficult for CB to quantify or analyze these jerks in the past. I took a stab at it here, and maybe there is some prior art for this, but I'd love to hear all of your ideas. I think the jerks of omission are even harder to spot, since they involve an intimate knowledge of Reddit's jerks and what important things you've never seen come up over the past several months, but once again they often take place outside the comment section.

Hopefully this novel contributes something. Someone should try this for a different subreddit's link posts.",,t5_2tnz9,1376041079.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1k0mhj/a_subredditwide_jerk_an_analysis_of_til_and/

and

Followed by LOL BROKEN ARMS!!! OEDIPUS!!! 

Some of the pedophilic comments aren't *too* bad but it just shows the repetition and idiocy of incest/pedophilia on reddit.

The second I read this I just became filled with rage. HAHAHA Fatty with a pretty girl? Now I know me and my fedora can escape the friend zone! This comment is just the start of so much shit posting.

&gt;Maybe he's funny or something



&gt;&gt;I seriously doubt it.

&gt;He must be rich right? Only way I can make sense of this. That or he gained 50-100 lbs. since they married.

When I read the ""He must be rich right?"" I thought he was gonna call them on their bullshit but nope

After all the fat bashing I was ready to lose it but then people ditch the fat jokes and go after the woman.

&gt;Maybe she's really annoying.

Seriously? Bringing him up to her standards didn't work so lets bring her down to his!

&gt;Uhh, or reserve. Just look at the shirt she's wearing. She'd cheat on him for a short stack of pancakes.

This is a fucking joke right? One picture of a woman with her family and he has her figured out. Judging from his other comments I doubt he's joking. It can't get worse than this though... right?

&gt;She's not a looker

&gt;Not saying she's a catch

/r/news and /r/politics are hot-spots for the ""NSA IS [le]TERALLY HITLER"" jerk. We all know that. But at least that makes a little sense. Edwrd Snowden is making news, and to therefore understand that Reddit is made up of largely young white males that spend too much time on the internet and have no real problems to be concerned with, you need to check out subs where it is thoroughly irrelevant. A sub like /r/technology.

Let's start by looking at [the new queue](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/new/). At the time of this writing

I'm sure there's an argument to be made that internet privacy policy falls under the sub's guidelines that content must be ""on technology (news, etc.)"" But it's a stretch at best. And even if such articles are appropriate, the idea that an article on Twitter reporting antisemitic tweets is considered more relevant to technology that [the invention of a Terminator-esque robot](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i4pkz/be_afraid_darpa_unveils_terminatorlike_atlas/) is absurd.

[I really really love what inevitably results from these threads.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61px1g) You get a little bit of everything. Misogyny, rampant assumptions. Everything that makes reddit reddit. And, of course, reddit's favorite past time: righteous indignation!

How side-splittingly melodramatic is that ""You owe her nothing"" line? And, ""...essentially saying that I am obligated to her not to spread this because it's no one else business."" That ""essentially"" makes it pretty clear she never brought up obligation herself, and he is giving her words a liberal butthurt interpretation. I'm personally working on the assumption that her words were closer to, ""Can you please not be a dick about this and tell people it wasn't working out or we decided to see other people or any other cliche phrase people say to reduce the number of unwitting outsiders dragged into their own personal drama?"" Actually, it probably wasn't that well-worded. I had time to mull over that line, and I'm not currently experiencing any extremes of emotion. 

Of course, of course she'll slander him. Because we know absolutely nothing about her except that she's a woman... oh yeah, that's all we need to know.

And let's not miss this opportunity to [demonize female sexuality](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61rvdu).

[SRS already mentioned this for its forceful, and what brings me back to my original point, is the repetition of the word ""obligated."" The reason this person used that word is because it was in the original post. But we can all be completely positive that the girlfriend-in-question never used that word. It is completely the OP's interpretation that she thinks he's obligated to do something, and now a word she never said is being turned around on this hypothetical, [very possibly nonexistent](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61sm0l) woman. 

Our next thread [ranks even higher on the DIDN'T HAPPEN chart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6vx2/update_im_100_sure_my_wife_is_cheating_on_me_with/). This is an update thread (these things always have update threads). In a scene right out of Cheaters, and DRAMATICALLY CLOSED THE BLINDS OF THEIR ROOM, all while OP frantically took pictures and video from the rental car. Don't think too hard about how OP knew exactly which window to look in. He eventually drew her out of the room by repeatedly setting her car alarm off. She didn't come out until the third time because suspense works best in groups of threes. Of course, OP is still wondering if he can patch up his relationship because he needs to cue reddit's response board on their predictable reactions. Why even bother linking to them? They're all exactly like the last one.

Thread number 3 is a bit of a departure in that the victim is not the poster. [I think my sister is cheating on her deployed husband. What can I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/) is also hilariously made up / written by a twelve year old and contains the funniest sentence I've ever read:

""I know what sex sounds like and I heard it: moans

OP KNOWS WHAT SEX SOUNDS LIKE! 

That's a relief. 

What's interesting about the viewer response to this is that, they preemptively accused her of making up lies to that effect. The wildly different responses in the comments sections to two basically identical stories based on the narrator's relative distance to the situation is enough by itself to discredit anonymous internet advice. So why do people still seek it?

FINAL THOUGHT:

Relationships are complicated. Often times, and one should always be willing to share the blame for a failed relationship. After all, nobody's perfect. Of course, most people who write to internet forums about being victimized by their girlfriends are amateur screen writers, and only people with no worldly experience could ever believe the hyperbolized soap-operas these guys cook up.

Part of the reason this is getting so much recognition is that there was an earlier thread about this, competing site with a similar purpose?

It seems to be a meme on Reddit that 4chan is this cool, horrible parts.

To be less of a smart ass

- treat an incredibly

- treat pretty much any kind of web forum as some kind of special secret anyone is cool for knowing about

- treat a website full of so much racism

- copy images from that site

In summary

Unsurprisingly 4chan seems to hate Reddit even though Redditors love it. Reddit is the less edgy, 4chan's little brother.

I'm astounded.

It seems like the US Military can't do anything right with Reddit. I haven't seen one comment in that thread so far that actually praises them or acknowledges the work they done. Because guess what? They've fucked **a lot** of the Taliban up. The Taliban are a total shadow of what they used to be - and that is thanks to the War in Afghanistan. What is so fucking evil about being grateful for that or acknowledging that? 

But wait! The War in Afghanistan has killed CIVILIANS! So therefore we can't mention the evil American Army. Forget the fact that compared to other wars civilian deaths have been quite low and forget the fact that the Taliban deliberately put themselves in situations that will lead to innocents dying when soldiers defend themselves. 

Look, is probably very grey. But God damnit, what makes these people so willing to completely demonize their own troops - even when they are eliminating a threat Redditors themselves despise.

and then

This is one of the more prevalent reasons why Reddit hates this show: ""because if you take the laugh track out, but I digress.  

Of course there's the ""I hate it because it makes fun of smart people like me"" jerk:

&gt; Because it feels like it's a group of people acting how dumb people think smart people act... rather than how smart people actually act.....

As you can see, a white male, is single, is more to the center of the political scale, has been to college, is unemployed or in school still, an atheist or agnostic.

Some things I was surprised about:

Christianity was the third most popular response for religion, I didn't expect.

More people to the center of the political scale than to the left. Also

We have a lot of Swedes and Irish people here!

12 PhDs? All in Atheism I suppose?

I hate /r/gaming. It's made me actively despise interacting with gamers. I hate them all. I hate Zelda. I hate motherfucking Mario and Luigi.  I hate Assasin's Creed fans even though I genuinely enjoyed the game. I hate Portal and its shit sequel, but at the same time, fuck Civilization.  If you want one more turn, than take another fucking turn.

On the other side, but because when I head over to /r/gaming for my daily dose of reddit hyperbole, it spawns the best comments.  I loved Spore. It was a fun game that I derived a modicum of enjoyment from for a few evenings. Then I put it aside. $60 for a game isn't unreasonable, because I think (and fuck you, I'm not going to find a fucking source) the costs for production and general length and quality of games have gone up over the years.  

I shouldn't love these former things so passionately, and I sure as heckfire (Fuck you, Groundhog's day.) would judge you negatively if you wore a jacket like the one from Assassin's Creed.

Yeah,"" but what are the alternatives? For example, what other site has all the features that Flickr has/had (Yahoo removed many of the sites best features this year with their terrible redesign) and also has a similar community and anywhere near as many users and viewers? And if they run Tumblr into the ground, what other site is out there to take its place? I'm fine with switching to other sites to share my work instead, but my concern is that Yahoo will kill them off and there won't be any real alternatives, or at least none that have the same features and reach the same audience that Flickr and Tumblr did.
Whether you use Tumblr or not

&gt;Those of you arguing in favor of Farenheit:

&gt;You are advocating that ""commoners"" use a different system of measurement than ""scientists"". If nothing else this only further separates the majority from science, especially in America where the number of STEM students is falling at an alarming rate. If there is a good reason for ""scientists"" to use a particular scale or unit of measurement then those same reasons should apply to everyone, because EVERYONE should consider themselves a scientist in their every day lives, even if the only experiment they ever do is to determine which brand of paper towel is a better value or whatever.

&gt;In fact

&gt;The mental disconnect between scientists and non-scientists is damaging

Ha. He wants to switch Kelvin to bridge the ""mental disconnect"" between ""scientists"" and ""commoners"". How much more fucking pretentious can you get? I mean yeah, and is merely advocating ""Everyone should think like a scientist"".

&gt;However

Ugh. Yes, 0 degrees is roughly the coldest you'll get and 100 degrees is roughly the hottest you'll get. It's a good system for weather because it has a common range of positive two-digit numbers. But no, it sucks because it was derived from something arbitrary. Never mind *everything else about the unit*. It *must* suck because it was derived from something arbitrary. 

&gt;While the Fahrenheit height scale sucks for measurement, and distance would be much better to switch to if we were to focus on switching to SI units.

Alright, they usually reference that NASA thing where someone did a bad conversion between metric and imperial, and it cost them a lot of money. Alright, yeah, that was one thing, but that's the ONLY time in science that the imperial system has fallen short. Anyone with a job in science whose job depends on making precise measurements is already using metric. I'm pretty sure most of the metric circlejerkers don't even know that. They think that everyone in America is forced to use imperial, and we all laugh in the faces of metric simply because we all think America is better than the rest of the world.

Pretty much the only thing we use imperial for is weights, and temperature. And anytime anyone is in a laboratory, they're using metric. So what's the big fucking deal?

I kid.  Jump on in to 4, 'why would these people emigrate' and more ground breaking insight into world's second largest religious group.

Partytime86 responds to Horse_Guy with a comment that really captures the essence of the thread. 

&gt;Unfortunately this nonsensical barbaric behavior will likely continue because of apologetics swooping in to defend this nonsense. I'm just waiting for SRS to swoop in like good apologetic and start defending this behavior. These barbarians need to be shocked into the modern cultural era where women

A) Love referring to them as barbarians, if you're commenting and can't work SRS, frankly I think you don't know how to reddit. D) This follows with four additional edits directed at the ""apologist"".

&gt;No respect for free speech, but honestly if seen this happen way too many times...

Maybe some sort of Islamic Liberia? No..? Well we'll think of something.

&gt;Why do muslims believe the world owes islam respect? If a country's citizens are free to express themselves

Probably the same reasons the other three quarters of the worlds populations believes they're owed respect? Also the contributions to mathematics

&gt;Why do they even go to Western countries with free speech if they know they will walk away butt-hurt when their stone age religion gets mocked? Why don't they just stay in their native Islamic countries where they will be free to fester in their ignorance?

Economic prosperity, escape war/regional conflict, oppressing you. 


Ooo

What appears to be an honest question:
&gt;Why did they show up to watch a movie that they don't want to watch? What a bizarre video.

And the answer is....

&gt;To incite violence. The fervor and high from righteous religious violence is a potent drug.
Ask any person at any riot after a big sports team win. Or the blacks who destroyed their own communities during the LA riots.

Excuse the sports reference

I find it interesting how Redditors like to act superior to 9Gaggers (is that a thing?) and dislike them for ""stealing"" their content while they praise and love The Pirate Bay for allowing them to download and use Hollywood's property. 

Posts such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11mf1l/the_pirate_bay_moves_to_the_cloud_becomes/) praise The Pirate Bay for tackling corporations that charge for the distribution of music and movies. But, whereas in another they seek to punish those that try to steal their intellectual property. 

I find this contrast interesting and although none of these posts are exactly topical currently

Didn't read? The poster tells /r/atheism about how he taught sunday school at a church, which is next door to two other big churches, and comes across a homeless guy. He tells the homeless man that he doesn't have any change so he will go buy him some food. When he comes back with the food, the homeless man is surprised. 

Sounds good, nobody from any of the churches has ever helped the man. I mean, there's a homeless guy on the corner of three churches, how can he still be homeless if it wasn't for the evil condescending nature of religion. The poster's conclusion is rash, but the commenters are only supportive of him. Feel free to look through the comments yourself since I am an evil, lazy Christian.
