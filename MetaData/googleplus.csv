Why do this instead of just leeching my circle list? 

1. This has a permalink (unlike circles).

2. You can add or remove your own post if you feel the need to.

3. My circle list may not always have only redditors.

4. People in my list may not want to be added.

5. It keeps your reddit username a secret somewhat.

Any suggestions - please let me know.

But if we want to give Google+ a fighting chance (and I'm assuming that if you're in this subreddit

**So let's list all the reasons people should give G+ a try, and the stuff it does that Facebook just doesn't.**

That way

I'll start:

Google+ offers users an easy and intuitive way to group contacts into smaller circles (like Family, etc.). Users can then picks and choose which groups to share updates and messages with. You can send a book recommendation to just the members of your book club, and save everyone else the update. And you won't get a call from your parents or boss about that pic you posted of you slurping beer out of a stripper's belly button.

So if you've got a reason to make the switch

Besides

Let's get 'em.

**Edit:**

So far we've got:

* Message formatting
* You can make a post to just one person
* Hangouts
    * Hangouts is a free
    * Video chat automatically knows who is chatting (or who is chatting the loudest) and gives that person precedence via the large window
    * A hangout allows all users to share certain Google products. [Youtube videos
* Photo sharing
    * Instant upload to private album off Android
* Google product integration
    * Google Talk window is on Google+
* Sparks
    * In Facebook
* Sharing
    * Instantly upload photos and videos to the cloud
    * Easily share photos
    * If someone posts/tags a picture of you then it needs your approval
* Google+ lets people leave easily",,t5_2slj1,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplus/comments/ie6s1/the_advantages_of_google/

Two hours later I receive a photo of the thief to my Google+ instant upload folder.,,86,10,32,"So the story goes like this: I dropped my phone this morning and noticed it right away (my headphones were connected and the music stopped when the phone fell). The reason I didn't stop right away was that I was in process of moving my wallet from the same pocket to my bag

Fast forward two hours

How did this happen?

The likely explanation is that as I reported the phone stolen to my employer, which was later uploaded to Google+ instant upload. My SIM card is locked and I guess he put his own card in. Also, the phone is protected with a pattern lock so he is not able to actually sign in and use the phone.﻿

So basically, he proceeded to remove my sim card and tried to unlock the phone.

Most of my posts are public and I felt like finding a way to auto-import them to my blog. Even though there is no API yet

You can get anyone's public posts from this url:

    https://plus.google.com/_/stream/getactivities/?&amp;sp=[1,null,null,10,null,""social.google.com"",[]]

The profile ID is 109412257237874861202. The actual JSON starts with )]}' to prevent JS/browser hacks and once you remove those

    pf = *paste the entire JSON and press enter - don't type these asterisks*

If everything works

    pf[1][0]

This will show the array of public posts

Edit: Each on the public posts in the pf[1][0] array has the following format:

    [4] = Full HTML text
    [5] = Unix timestamp followed by 3 digits for ms
    [7] = Comments
    [11] = Array of one or more links
    [11][x][3] = Title of link
    [11][x][5][1] = URL of image uploaded
    [11][x][21] = Description of link
    [11][x][24][1] = Linked URL
    [11][x][24][4] = Type: document, video
    [11][x][41][0][1] = Thumbnail of image
    [21] = Link to Google+ page for the post

Edit 2: If you want to use PHP's json_decode function, and all *,,* with *,"""",* first.

On the other hand though, an interesting shop, or a little drama or a funny anecdote that took place just there... Those are events that usually don't come along as very interesting unless you're part of the context, ie. at the location.

I love the nearby (ex-Buzz) idea, because many people are reluctant to post all out public. If there was a ""share this post with nearby only"", it would help flourish the geo buzz.

However, more importantly, until it fixes those problems, most computer-savvy people will hold on to their facebook accounts, and most ordinary people will not switch at all. This assumes, of course, that many of the current bugs and glitches will be worked out fairly quickly.

Here are some of the big issues I've found with it.

* Google+ does not emphasis relationships among users.

This is the primary problem I've found with Google+

Perhaps the problem is best personified in the fact that it is impossible to be ""In a relationship WITH"" someone else. It is important to remember that Facebook's relationship status is a huge aspect of the site; for the first time in modern American society

Users also cannot list friends as participating in the same class or activity as one can on Facebook. 

Additionally, check the profiles of my friends to see if anyone I know is now using the site and I am not aware of it.


* Google+ does not have a built in

Facebook essentially replaces email; Google+ has no email functionality


* Google+ and Gtalk chat integration is absolutely terrible. 

People I'm in mutual circles with do not show up in my Chat list. I'm not sure if this is a bug

I cannot emphasize the importance of this:

With Facebook

Perhaps a ""John Smith has added you to his circles. Would you like to add him to your circles and then be able to chat and message with him? Click Here"" notification/button would help to fix this problem.


* The profile ""Info"" page needs to change its focus.

The info page is a terrific triumph of Facebook

When one adds someone on Facebook, political views, favorite books, movies, TV, activities, and other interests of a person. This is huge in establishing relationships between people who don't know each other too well. HUGE. 

I kind of expect a reply to this along the lines of ""Google+ isn't for people who don't know each other!""; firstly, this issue doesn't just affect acquaintances. Countless times I have friended people who I genuinely consider my friends on Facebook, and then learned that they are into the same books/video games/political views/anime/activities as I am. Then, I was able to talk to them about the topic.

In other words


* There is no group/event functionality.

Most people stay on Facebook because of this feature. I cannot believe Google+ has not yet currently implemented it. 

For example, the group users could instantly chat with each other or post on the wall of the event, or upload pictures. A poll was posted to help decide the times. When potential new players were found, they could simply be added to the group and instantly be caught up with the affair.

This kind of social event is simply not plausible in the same way on Google+.


* Finally: Google+ cannot beat Twitter. It can beat Facebook

I feel that a lot of the answers to this may be along the lines of:

""Google+ doesn't need to do that! Google+ isn't *supposed* to do that!""

The point I have to make is this: If Google+ isn't supposed to do these things

It isn't going to become the next Twitter, and public events. 

Twitter is well-established in this market, weaker clone of Twitter which nobody uses. They're interested in communicating with their friends in an easy and simple way. Google+ can do this for them, but it is going to need a lot of work.

Edit: I've had a few responses, and my Google+ account isn't my real one. If you want to be circlemates, just PM me and I can give you the one I use.

x6: Okay. My fingers are about to fall off. Plus I think other people can easily do what I was doing if everyone sticks to about five invites per person (too many and it STOPS WORKING until you're on another account.) So if your friends/connecs have already invited thirty people

 The easiest way to invite people is to create a circle,) and click this link:

You can try other notification links, so results may vary. 

Then the person will be prompted to sign in. Hopefully they should be able to. If it doesn't work

Extremely easy. Post if it works. I'm curious to see why/how it does. And also whether I'm just magic or not. (I'm not.)

It's Google's new social networking site. When it was first unveiled


It's main selling point is 'Circles' (privacy settings based on who you want to share info with). Facebook already has this in the form of 'Friends Lists


Ultimately

**Privacy


See, they cannot put your posts in their news feed for easy access. They have to go to your page every time. This is difficult for people who don't like having randoms as their friends or well-known people who already have 5,000 friends (the Facebook limit). Oh, and up until late August, you were unable to change the privacy settings of posts once you had already posted them.


With Twitter, yet when I want to @reply someone that has not specifically asked to follow me, they cannot read what I send them. Also, of course, you cannot follow what everyone is saying in response to a tweet, like you can with Google+ and Facebook.


From the start


**The Cool Extras**

Right now, you may have to download a small plug-in from Google which only takes a moment. All you have to do is press, ""Start a Hangout"" on your homepage, set your privacy settings (in case you only want certain circles to be able to join), and bam. Your hangout will appear on your approved circles' news feeds and they can join by just clicking the button. From what I know, the maximum is 10 right now, but remember


I'm loving it so much because most of my closest friends have gone off to the same college/neighboring colleges within the past few weeks. I will be joining them for the Spring 2012 semester, but as of late August, the only time there is a problem is if there is a known internet connection issue with someone. Oh, and you can share YouTube videos and all watch at the same time, pretty much down to the second (even if you're popping in later than the others).


Games are also just now being implemented in a cool way, but I haven't used that much.

The most important part about the games is that, there isn't any question as to whether or not these companies are going to steal your information if you play their game. Also, I don't see any evidence of the pyramid scheme-type stuff you always see on Facebook (play this, get your friends to play so you can get better levels/stuff, then they have to get their friends to play...).



**TL;DR: Google+ is kicking butt and taking names... while in BETA.**

The project will revolve around a website that includes simple explanations on why Facebook is bad (objective reasons with sources, etc.), reasons why Google+ is better (features and politics), and invite people to ""change the social fabric of the web in 30 days"" or something along those lines.

To participate, though they can if they want.

This will hopefully have several effects:

* Introduce people to Google+ and its superior UX

* Make sure that people who join Google+ and add people to their circles will instantly have content to view and interact with from their friends.

* Increase the number of people on Google+

I dislike Facebook as a product and as a company and believe that there are plenty of legitimate reasons stop using their services (I moved to G+ long ago). Most people don't care and will simply go where their friends are

I fully expect that it will start with just a tiny number of tech enthusiasts participating. But if enough people announce that they are participating, etc., it could really gain a lot of momentum. That's the idea anyway.

This is especially true if you are the type who is anal about organization of albums.  For instance, love it, but if I go to share said photo it transfers to the From Posts folder.  From here it can be moved to a folder of your choice without breaking it in Google +...almost.  Comments and so on retain themselves, but the photos are removed from your profile photos.

In fact, but it simply doesn't work.  None of it.  In my opinion, there needs to be a step between Instant Upload folder and From Posts.  When choosing to share it should be asked where you want it to moved to, instead of putting it in the From posts folder.

I’m sick of tagging people on Facebook every time I want a group of people to see something I’m sharing.  I think most people who share things with a specific group of people in mind feel the same way.  Google circles addresses this problem very nicely

It seems to me that we, while eloquently designed and a better social networking option than Facebook, inherently cannot address this issue simply because it is new.  When you sign up there is no one there to immediately share your interests with, so most people sign up for it then forget about it.  There’s no point in checking an empty news feed every day.  It creates a sort of positive feedback cycle where no one is sharing things because people aren’t sharing things.

I believe I have an idea that will help to alleviate this; allowing one to invite someone to a specific circle.  Now I know circles are personalized for each individual, etc.. for themselves) and give them the option of finding others which I already have in that circle and befriend them.  Then they could immediately start sharing things of similar interest with that group of people.  In addition they would also have access to a substantial amount of user generated content that they would be interested in.   Now there is a good reason to comeback. 

People generally tend to have mutual friends

**TL;DR Invitation system that promotes immediate content of interest to the person being invited.  Invite people to a circle so they can immediately start sharing things with other people in that circle.**

   I should be able to tag people in addition to circles. Make it an advanced option so as to not confuse everybody if needed. Tags can be used to determine who to send something to just like circles

    **Use case**: I want to share an article on football with the 15 people I talk sports with

    **Why circles aren't sufficient**: I have hundreds of interests I might want to connect with people about. Making a ton of circles with the same people placed over and over would be time-consuming, and could muddle the privacy stuff. When I add somebody as a friend, I just type in things I know we are both interested in, and I can add those over time without big reorganizations.

2. **Opt-in option when adding to circles**

    Assuming they already have me in one of their circles

     **Use case**: I'm not 100% sure if my friend is as into Android phones as I am, but he's not sure."" They can then opt in or opt out at any time, and I don't have to worry that I'm bugging them with stuff they don't care about.

3. **Customization of which circles are included in my overall stream.**

     **Use case**: I like following Notch, family, and epic bros. The only place I see the real people I know all in one place is the home screen and the overall stream since they're split in groups. I should be able to keep that kind of view minus the people I follow for very different reasons.

If I wanted to add a new internet friend to say

In the past I'd have to create a separate facebook account for all my internet friends if I wanted to remain pseudo-anonymous. Then I'd have to check multiple facebook accounts

So here is my idea - and I know to some this may seem ridiculous ('who cares if people know your real name') but I like to keep a little privacy until I know the person better:

Add a little Personas section, let's say, 'LoL Friends'. Then you can edit exactly what the circle can access and HOW it looks for them - maybe you have different interests or different sites or a different name.

Then you right-click the circle and press 'generate persona code' which gives you a little code like 'a829fjs' or w/e.

Then you give this code to your LoL Friends and when they go to google+/yourcode they see your profile UNDER that persona

After that, but the profile they see, your boss sees, and your friends see are completely different.

After your done editing your profile it should automatically ask you to link your Picasa to your google account. After you do that you should be able to use the invite that someone sent you.

Hopefully this will help people having the problem where you click the ""Join Google +"" and it re-directs you to the tour / try later page.",,t5_2slj1,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplus/comments/idzju/possible_fix_for_being_unable_to_accept_your/

Google+ is intended to support these types of relationships as evidenced by the default ""Following"" circle. But since this method of following people by adding them to a circle provides no differentiation between two-way and one-way relationships, will not want the profile data which is intended for people who know them personally to also be shared with the people they follow.

*Edit*: After thinking about this a bit

1. Add a system other than circles for followers. I think that circles are a big selling point of Google+

2. You want (I think?) to be able to downvote posts.

3. I'm not actually sure on your thoughts on comments saying ""+1!"" and the like.

1. We have an official reddit G+ account for us all to add. It could save us some time if we could all go to one account rather than trying to connect everybody.

Comments like ""dumb link"" or ""lol, upvoted!"" are not terribly informative. Just click the arrows.""

3. In every post that will include people's gmail/G+ you should (or must?) put in a **bold** disclaimer saying something like ""**You post your email and G+ profile at your own risk of trolls/spammers etc.**""

It seems that Google+ displays the number of columns based on the window width the **last** time you viewed it instead of **this** time. 

So I have to manually reload the page every time I open Google+ to see the right number of columns.
