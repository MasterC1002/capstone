*****

### Myofibrillar hypertrophy

*****

Myofibrillar hypertrophy, which are the contractile proteins in the myofibrils (the type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers, or the “fast-twitch” fibers). In simpler terms, when lifting heavy weights and putting your muscles under new stress (**progressive overload** -- increasing either the volume or weight of a lift every workout to ensure increased myofibrillar hypertrophy), your body will respond by strengthening it’s ability to contract its muscles. 

The recruited motor units in the movements also increase with myofibrillar hypertrophy, hence the need to progressively increase weight.  Ultimately, the effect is an increase in the strength and response of your fast-twitch muscle fibers. The “stronger” your fast-twitch fibers, the “stronger” the neuromuscular response, and the heavier the weight you are able to lift.

*****

### Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy

*****

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, glycogen, creatine phosphate, and water. In simpler terms, when sarcoplasmic hypertrophy occurs, the amount of fluid (or cytoplasm) in the muscle increases (expands), creating a larger muscle. This type of hypertrophy is achieved by using slower

Note that increasing the size of a muscle **does not** require an increase in the amount of contractile protein in the myofibrils

*****

### How do I train for the different types of hypertrophy? 

*****

The primary way to train for size or strength is to measure the time under tension

Neuromuscular training focuses on the nerves and increasing the contractile proteins in the myofibrils. This is specialized by keeping your muscles under very heavy stress (within 85-100% of your 1RM)

Metabolic training focuses on the supply of energy of muscles

You may have noticed that there is a gap between 75-85% of your 1RM between these levels of training. That is because that is the spot where these two forms of training are generally on an even level (i.e. you will increase strength and size in a somewhat equal manner).

*****

### How should I measure my 1 rep maximum and the related percentages?

*****

Fortunately

*****

### How should I measure the time my muscles are under tension in accordance with my goals?

*****

The easiest way to do this is to adhere to a specific rep scheme. Naturally, when completing a higher amount of reps your muscles will be under tension for longer, and the weight will need to a be a little further from your maximum to allow for the higher volume (and therefore building size through metabolic training). Here are the rep guidelines to follow for your specific training goals:

Rep Range|Percent of 1 Rep Max|Achieved Amounts of Hypertrophy|
:---|:---:|---:|
1-5 Reps|85-100%|Mostly myofibrillar
6-8 Reps|75-85%|A near equal moderate amount of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic|
9-12 Reps|70-75%|Largely sarcoplasmic
13-15 Reps|65-70%|Mostly sarcoplasmic
15+ Reps |65% and below|Largely endurance

*Note that as you more you increase the reps beyond 15

*****

### How do I use this information to create a workout routine to meet my goals?

*****

First, or do you want to work on both at the same time? There is nothing wrong with any of these goals, and each has their own pros/cons:

* Primarily training for strength is a goal that has few cons, and overtraining can occur easily. If you want to train for strength, employ set/rep schemes such as 5x5, 6x4, 8x3 with high rest periods in between sets. Lift within 85% of your 1RM at 5 reps, and increase the percentage as you decrease reps.
* Primarily training for size is a goal that has benefits, you will eventually hit a wall in the gains you are able to make due to a lack of increased strength, and you will have to focus some on strength training at some point (this is the reason strength programs are recommended for beginners). The lower your level of strength, the sooner you are going to hit a plateau.  If you want to train primarily for size, employ set/rep schemes such as 3x15, 4x12, and 5x9 with a lower rest period in between sets. Supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest in between) also becomes a strong option to deplete even more energy. Lift at least 65% of your 1RM
* Training for both strength and size is in my opinion the best way to go. You get the benefits of both forms of training at the same time.  There are two methods that I recommend to achieve this:

## Method #1: Traditional Strength/Size Optimization Training

Employ set rep schemes such as 4x8, 80% for 7 reps, and ~85% for 6 reps. 

## Method #2: Linear Periodization

Linear periodization allows you to focus your goals on different ranges on the hypertrophy spectrum during different “periods.” Here are two examples of a linear periodization schedule:

Weeks 1-4: 3x15 reps at 65% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 4x10 reps at 72% of your max  
Weeks 9-12: 5x5 reps at 85% of your max  

Weeks 1-4: 4x12 reps at 70% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 5x7 reps at 80% of your max  
Weeks 9-12 6x3 reps at 90% of your max  

In the end, a pyramid rep scheme, etc. that you should eventually utilize all the different rep ranges if you want to your training to be as optimal and effective as possible.

Alrighty. In this post I am going to summarize my complete journey from a skinny “Do you even lift?” kid to where I am today. I’ll tell you how I got there and share all I have learned along the way
	.
I first got interested in building some muscle when I was about 17. I worked out with a bench in my basement and got **some** results, protein, or anything. I didn’t look so great. Here’s some pics from that time period, spring of my senior year of high school:

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/aPKYM) body weight: about 150 lb

I’m the blonde kid. Yeah

Flash forward a few months and I get to college, I hit the gym every day and gave it 100%. Sadly that didn’t matter because my routine sucked and my diet was the same as before, I was obsessed with having abs so I severly limit my intake. No tracking of protein or any other macronutrients. Here’s where this got me after about six months:

[Album]( http://imgur.com/a/GZINe) Body weight was about 150 lb

As you can see I had some abdominal definition, girlfriend, undergraduate research completely taking over my life. I was no longer limiting my food intake however, and was eating whatever I wanted with a healthy appetite. 

After my time off, I was flabby and out of shape. I weighed about 185 lb. Not huge for 6'2''.

I decided one day that it was time to change, pretty much all the meat I want, and not a lot of carbs. Maybe a half cup of oatmeal a day. I don’t have any progress pics from the start of this period, I wish I did, it would be interesting to see. 

I found r/fitness (the best thing that ever happened to me fitness wise) and took in  and applied the new information. I started doing squats (albeit not to parallel), but I always gave it my all in the weightroom. For every exercise I would do 5 sets of 10 reps, hitting every body part. I split my workout into a shoulder/legs day; bicep/back day; and tricep chest/day. I also did HIIT cardio (sprinting) because I thought it would magically give me abs. After about six months of that I got to here:

[Spring 2008](http://imgur.com/a/8eTvE) Body weight about 190 lb

Well, bench, deadlift, ohp, and power clean, which is the essence behind SS and SL. What I did was essentially do two compound barbell movements every workout. For example I’d have a squat/ohp day; deadlift/power clean; and a bench/squat day. My routine might have looked something like this:

Day A: Squat 5 X 5; OHP 5X5; Dumbbell shoulder press 5 X 10; pull ups 5  X AMRAP(As Many Reps As Possible)

Day B: deadlift 5 X 5; power clean 5 X 5; dumbbell bicep curl 5 X 10; chin ups 5 X AMRAP; dumbbell rows 1 X AMRAP

Day C: Squat 5 X 5; barbell bench press 5 X 5; dumbbell bench press 5 X 5; pull ups 5 X AMRAP

Then take a rest day

During this period I was eating

[Fall 2011](http://imgur.com/a/nQBLC#0) body weight about 200 lb

Yep, also notice I was doing pull ups/chin ups every workout. I think that was a smart move on my part. But I was still just getting started. Here I am a few months later after doing a little bulk and a cut

[Spring 2012](http://imgur.com/a/cYHZc#0) weigh about 190 lb in these pics

I cut a little more after this point, but I would guess 3600 kCal. I Always I hit at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. My training switched over to 5/3/1. As per 5/3/1 instructions, I tested my 1RM on all my lifts, they were: Squat 330; Deadlift 405; Bench 270; and OHP 160. 

So I kept up with 531 and eating like a horse for a long time. I broke up the bench press progression with some cycles of smolov jr. After about 6 months my 1RM’s were: Squat 375lb; Deadlift 450 lb; Bench 300 lb; and OHP 175 lb. Cool. So I kept on trucking with that. I stepped up the intensity of my workouts, 440 X 6, and 405 X 10; OHP 190 X 1; bench didn’t move much. Here’s how I looked after all of that:

[Fall 2012](http://imgur.com/a/SEJza#0) weighed 220 lb at this time

In about a year I had gotten bigger and a shit ton stronger. I also realized I fucking sucked at powerlifting. My numbers were garbage from some one who weighed 220 lb and I was getting sick of low rep sets. So I decided to cut and focus on hypertrophy training. Time to see what muscle I had built under this fat. I scaled back the calories to 2300 kCal/day and started doing PHAT. This has taken me to where I am right now

[A few weeks ago](http://imgur.com/a/BJDWj#0) body weight is around 195 to 205 depending on how much water im holding and if I need to take a dumper.

I’m very happy with how I look today. I've surpassed what I've ever though was possible

1362400107.0,19mv5r,Fat Cutting Guide,InMyDreams_Nahh,295,47,66,"###Introduction:

____

This is a guide to help you understand the process of cutting body fat without losing while minimizing any strength or muscle loss. Before I go into the details of the guide

* Losing weight and cutting fat are the same thing:

Quite simply

* Carbohydrates should be axed if you want to cut fat:

This is true and false. Yes

* Have a high fat intake is going to make you fat:

No, this will be covered under nutrition. 

I would like to say that while my knowledge of fat cutting will get you far, and my processes will teach you to cut fat the most efficient way I know how.

That said, the more likely you will lose muscle along the way.

NOTE: I am going to use “lingo” and concepts that assume you have already read the information in our FAQ. I recommend reading that before you read this

_________

###Methods of Measuring Body Fat Percentage:

__________

There are a ton of methods to measure body fat. The less expensive

* The mirror. If you have absolutely no tools

* Measuring tape method. All you need is measuring tape. You just measure your waist, and that should give you a measurement within ~3%.

* Calipers. Can be bought for as cheap as $4-5. There are multiple methods to calculate your body fat using them

* BOD POD. Can be expensive depending on where it is done

* DEXA Scan. Currently the most accurate method

____________

###Before Starting Your Fat Cutting Plan:

_______

I’m sure that you’ve been gaining and working out for a long time. It’s very important that before you start operating a caloric deficit that you stabilize your new weight. 

To do this, continue your workout routine at the same level you would if you were trying to gain. 

For the second and final week, I can guarantee that your body has been over-trained to some degree. Before you try to cut the fat, you need to make sure your body is *fully* recovered. During this time, you should do nothing but very light cardio (walking) and stretching.

On the note of recovery

Once these two weeks are complete

_______

###Nutrition:

_______

If you’ve been following our advice on /r/gainit for a while now, I am going to recommend that you do the exact same, but in reverse! Lower your calories by 500 below your TDEE, and you will now be in a caloric deficit. 

Now

The first technique to efficiently cut fat is to properly manage your macros. When gaining, your macro ratios are much more vital to your success. Let’s go over each macro:

**Carbohydrates:**

When gaining

That said, if you are 20% body fat and weigh 200 lbs. you have 40 lbs. of body fat, you will have 160 lbs. of lean body mass. This means your ideal starting number is 160g a day. It’s that easy!

Now, take advantage of nutrient timing. The best way to do this is to divide your carbs up for when your glycogen stores need to be replenished most:

* Breakfast – 25% of total daily carbs
* Pre-Workout – 25% of total daily carbs
* Post-Workout – 25% of total daily carbs
* The rest of the day – 25% of total daily carbs

Timing nutrients like this gives you a hormonal advantage and will optimize fat burning. 

The best sources of carbohydrates:

* Oatmeal
* Brown Rice
* Vegetables
* Whole Grain Pasta
* Sweet Potatoes
* Fruits

We all know fruits and vegetables are crucial to a nutritional diet. I have a rule for each. For fruit, and post-workout. These are the times that your body is less sensitive to insulin spikes, which **must** be minimized for fat loss. 

For vegetables, dark green vegetables, not the starchy vegetables such as corn, pototoes, and legumes.

Carbohydrates are also the key to keeping your progress from stagnating. Ideally you should be losing anywhere from 0.5-1.0% of your body fat a week. If you are in this range

The last note on carbohydrates is to take advantage of an advanced technique known as “carb cycling.” This essentially means that every once in a while, if you wanted to re-feed, you would eat 224g that particular day. 

As for the frequency of re-feeds, you may want to space your re-feeds out to more like 7-14 days. The lower your carbohydrates for a single day go, the more crucial these re-feeds will be for maintaining your muscle mass.

**Protein:**

For protein intake, not just lean mass. The only other thing to keep in mind about protein is that you want it as absolutely lean as possible. 

The best sources of protein: 

* Chicken 
* Egg Whites
* Fish
* Whey Isolate

**Fats:**

As for fat, 920+640= 1560. That means your remaining 940 calories should come from fat. Since there are 9 calories per gram of fat, that equates to about 104.5g. 

The best sources of fats:

* Olive Oil
* Coconut Oil
* Natural Peanut Butter
* Assorted Nuts
* Flaxseed

_______

###Supplements:

_______

There are certain supplements that can further your goals. I would supplement with a multi-vitamin 3 times a day. I also recommend taking fish oils and vitamin C three times a day. A multi-vitamin will help to make sure your micronutrient requirements are sufficiently filled during the rough period of low caloric intake and Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help greatly as well. Fish Oils are great sources of polyunsaturated fat

I also take 5g of BCAA’s, and while they aren’t necessary, I highly recommend them (although they can be pricy!)

Note that while I've found those to be the best ranges for me

Also take into consideration what you get through your protein powder. For example, you will get 5.5g BCAAs and 7.1g Glutamine per scoop. Just something to keep in mind.

Chicken Fajitas:
Super simple recipe. I do this once every 2-3 weeks and make a few to freeze and have ready whenever I want. 

**Things youll need:**
Ziplock bags
White round flower tortilla
Chicken breast
Fajita seasoning 
Cheese (your pick)
Cooked Beans (I dont like these so dont use them)

**Optional:**
Sour cream, guacamole 

**Cooking:**
Night before!!!
Start by thawing your chicken and slicing it in to strips and mix in your Fajita mix! Throw a little olive oil in there too. 

Next day!!
get two pans!

Grab the tortilla and cut them in half and throw a little cheese in there. Once your chicken is done, wrap and throw it on that second pan. Make sure to watch them dont burn or stick. You may have to lower the heat. 

once they are done (browning tortilla) set them aside and let them cool down.

Throw in a ziplock in the freeze. 2 minutes on half power microwave and you have got Fajitas. Want some extra zing and cals? Add sour cream

Need a side dish? Make 3/4 cup of rice

I was told to post this here for you guys.

I'm 23 y/o


Skinny Picture I was around 155
After picture I weighed in at 184.  


Food wise:
Being the kid who could stay skinny no matter what I ate I took to the food route.  Eat as much High Protein stuff as I can (try to be clean stuff). Lean chicken and turkey can be your best friend.  I make a salsa chicken in the crock pot all the time.  Pretty cheap and easy. 
* 2lbs of chicken
* 10oz can of creme of chicken soup
* 16oz jar/can of salsa
Mix the two cans together pour over the chicken and cook on low for 6ish hours.  Shred the chicken and put back into crockpot


The only Supplement I added was a protein shake after I worked out. None of that fancy super fancy stuff just some cheap stuff from [GNC](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3267268&amp;cp=3593187.2108294)

**Thursday**
Random stuff I felt like working more on that week.
**Friday Saturday Sunday**

I can't really tell you exercises I did cause it changed a lot along with the big stuff that everyone knows for each muscle group.  When you get bored of what you're doing look up videos online of the muscle group your going to work out next and do those exercises you don't always do.


Find a friend to help you when you get started.  I got lucky and had a buddy who was a football player for a small college who was will to work out with the weak kid and got me started.  It also gives you a great reason to keep going if you have someone that will make you go.

1375210002.0,1jd6wn,[Progress] 135lbs -&gt; ~182lbs,spudole,225,27,125,"So I'll start this with saying that my starting weight was 135lbs

**This will be a long post

This is my progress from November '11 until today. I have bulked twice throughout almost two years

I am 6'1'', a male.
I started bulking at 135lbs and I [weighed in under 188](http://i.imgur.com/YSP8oxG.jpg) (with a belly full of water and some sweaty shorts/tank). So I'm around 180-182lbs currently.

I'll start with a few pictures of myself before my first bulk.

* [First](http://i.imgur.com/rutE981.jpg)
* [Second](http://i.imgur.com/2jaUq6A.jpg)

In November of 2011, but they kept pushing me through it. The next day was Back/Bi day and I think that was when I fell in love with going to the gym. Ever since then, I would do my best to never miss a day of lifting (unless I wanted a rest week or whatever).

For the next couple of months (November until June-2012)

* Monday- Chest/Tri
* Tuesday- Back/Bi
* Wednesday- Off
* Thursday- Chest/Tri
* Friday- Back/Bi
* Sat/Sun- Off

That's right. I **NEVER** did legs or shoulders and looking back on that, I finally weighed over 170lbs. So that's 35 pounds that I've gained in a little over half a year. I looked like this:

* [170ish pounds](http://i.imgur.com/KnlBVLm.jpg)
* [Again](http://i.imgur.com/1MkrVuI.jpg)

I decided the best thing for me to do would be to cut once I hit 170lbs, as well as taking protein shakes, but this time with only water. I ended up cutting back down to 155lbs (kind of sad because I felt like I was starting back at the bottom). I believe it was August/September whenever I took this picture at the end of my cut:

* [sorry about the shitty quality


so from just cutting creatine/fats out of my diet, it wasn't the end of the world. I maintained that weight, fluctuating from 155 to 160, even getting down to 150lbs at one point. Late in January/early February 2013, I decided it was time to bulk again. I started on the basic **5x5 stronglifts** and this time I can tell you exactly what I ate with this neato meal plan picture:

* [woooooooo](http://i.imgur.com/su28JtK.jpg)

Meal 5 was [this shake](http://caloriecount.about.com/retooled-svunt-shake-recipe-r1115661) and I would only take that one days where I worked out and I'd try to drink it right before bed.
Now I didn't always stick to the meal plan. Sometimes it would be easier to have some mcdoubles and a milkshake after a workout, mcchickens, milkshakes, 5 layer burritos, 5 soft fresca style tacos, etc. would become my friend for whenever I was starving and wanted something cheap. (I know, I know, my stomach suffered from it and I grew a gut. My girlfriend would never say anything about it

**SORRY THAT THIS IS GETTING SUPER LONG

I was seeing my strength gains

* ***$ = ramp up the weight every set.***

**Monday Upper A - Heavy Horizontal/Lighter Vertical**- 

* Incline DB Press 5x5$ (80lb dumbbells for the last set)
* Bench 5x5$ (I think it hit a little over 200lbs on my last set)
* BB Row 5x5$ (180 for the last set)
* OH Press 3x10 (80lbs for these sets
* Pullups - 3x10
* BB Curl - 2x8 (70lbs)
    

**Tuesday Lower A - Heavy Squats /hamstring assistance and core**- 

* Squats- 5x5$ (I did 300 for my last set
* Lying hamstring curls 3x8 (100lbs)
* Back hyper-extensions 3x10
* Calf Raises 3x20 (over 200 pounds)
* abs 


**Wednesday - Rest**



**Thursday Upper B - Heavy Vertical/Lighter Horizontal**-

* Press 5x5$ (135 for last set)
* Weighted Pullup 5x5 (sometimes I do closegrip chin ups for bicep width with 45lbs)
* Incline DB Bench 3x10 (70 lb dumbbells)
* Bench 3x10 (160lbs)
* BB Row 3x10 (140lbs)
* Weighted Dips 2x8 (with 80lbs)


**Friday Lower B - Heavy Deadlift/lighter quad and core**- 

* Deadlift 5x5$ (320lbs with the last set)
* Leg Press 4x10$ (400lbs with the last set)
* Leg extensions 3x10 (around 150lbs I think)
* Calf Raises 5x20 (leg press machine with around 200lbs)
* abs

**Saturday - Rest**

**Sunday - Rest**





and that's pretty much it. Squats/Deadlifts I do barefoot so I can feel it a bit more in my calf muscles (they've grown a bit over half an inch since I've started doing this). With abs, or weighted decline sit-ups. I do incline benches before my regular benches because my upper chest was underdeveloped compared to the rest of my chest. Here's a squat picture (with a towel cause I'm a wuss and my friend took the picture on my way up)

**Diet**



This is the most important component.  Food fuels the building of your body.  In order of importance:


1. Caloric Goal.  Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the average amount of calories you burn each day including the energy needed to process food.  It's a combination of what your Basal Metabolic Rate (BSR aka what your body burns to keep you alive) plus any physical activity you complete that day.  You can get an approximation of your TDEE using [this](http://users.telenet.be/WBtE/cunning.html) or other calculators.  Bulking is eating above your TDEE (typically about +500).  Cutting is eating below TDEE (typically about -500).  Maintenance is eating at your TDEE.  A general bulking start point is 3000 calories/day for men or 2500 calories/day for women.  Weigh yourself regularly and adjust your goal so that you're gaining roughly 1 lbs week.  



2. Macros.  Macronutrients are protein (amino acids), aim for that goal to be met with approximately 30% protein, 30% fat, and 40% carbohydrates.  The 30/30/40 split is a general guideline and you may find that adjustments are needed to best suit your specific needs.



3. Micros. Micronutrients are vitamins/minerals/etc.  With your macros in mind




With the above in mind, Whole Milk, Beans, Nuts, Vegetables.  



Supplements: Supplements are exactly what they sound like



High Metabolism: People with ""high metabolisms"" only burn about 200 calories more per day than the average.  200 calories is a couple tablespoons of peanut butter.  In other words






**Fitness**



With the diet portion under control



1. Form.  Form is number one.  Read as much as you can about proper form and ask someone at your gym to check you.  Video tape yourself if you have the ability to do so.  Improper form can cause injury and



2. Frequency. Three times a week, you should be able to either workout longer, lift heavier weights, or push out more reps than before.  If you cannot do one of these, you have not fully recovered.



3. Style.  Full body workout.  Focus on exercises



4. Method.  Aim for 3-5 sets of 5-8 reps for each exercise each workout.  Rest for 90 to 180s between sets.  The last few reps of your last set should be very tough and take everything you have left.  The rep and rest ranges are geared to balance gaining both [strength and size (hypertrophy)](http://imgur.com/mvMuFAN).



5. Recovery. Your body is made up of more than just muscles (immune system, etc.) and effective gaining requires that they also get the requisite recovery time.  Every 9-15 weeks (depending on level of conditioning) take a full week off exercise and reduce calories back to a maintenance level.  




With the above in mind, Reddit Bodyweight Fitness FAQ workout) and exercises (Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift, Pull Ups, Push Ups, etc.) become strong choices.






**Tips**



* Track everything you eat at first to gain an accurate guage of how many calories foods have.  Sites such as [myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) are great for this.



* Track your workouts.  Looking back and seeing how far you've come is a great motivator.  A notebook or a site like [Fitocrarcy](http://www.fitocrarcy.com) work well for this.



* It may be tough to change your diet at first.  Consider eating a workout.  You will need to eat when you're not hungry.  You might not like it and you may struggle towards the end of it.  However, you will find that you're hungrier and that you can eat more than before.



* Plan your meals out ahead of time.  Cook them ahead of time if you find yourself often crunched for time after a long day.



* Listen to your body.  If an exercise hurts (not in the good way) back off, it's often better to take the time off to let it heal now rather than try to fix it later.



* Allow yourself small food cheats occasionally.  Don't go nuclear with your diet.  It's okay to eat cookies, etc. on occasion.  Just keep them as treats, not staples of your diet.



* The other people at the gym don't care that you're small.  Don't be intimidated.  You're there bettering yourself



* Don't sweat the small stuff.  It's cliche but true.  If your lifts stall or your weight stalls, not big ones.  



* Your rest days should get as much attention as your workout days.  A hard workout tears your muscles down while recovery days rebuild it.  As such

I'm at the gym and I'm on strong lifts program. I just finished my squats and head over to bench press. I successfully did my sets the previous workout so I increase and place 50 lbs on each side. 

I begin my workout and when I'm on my last set 4th rep my arms completely shut down on me. I honestly don't know why because I didn't feel tired and it was fairly easy. The barbell collapses on my chest and I'm trying  my hardest to lift it but nothing happens and I'm struggling. 

I start yelling for help but nobody comes over. The trainer was not in the room but there were well over 15 people. I look to my left and I see a woman staring. I don't mind her not helping because she probably thinks she can't lift the barbell but she could've told someone. I look to my right and some guy on the Smith machine is staring at me while he continues to workout. 

It's now 2 minutes later and I try to throw my weight to the right so the whole barbell collapses but i cant move. I'm losing feeling in my chest. I'm thinking what the fuck this has to be a dream

I start yelling again this time I yelled

Having spent a year bulking

I read Starting Strength and got with its program in May and stuck with it until late August. Then I read Jamie Lewis's book

I got in the habit of going to the gym at 5:30 pm every day which allowed me to see the same general crowd of lifters. I started to make friends and eventually found my now current lifting buddy and coach in late October. He's a bodybuilder and I'm now on a routine where we do a 5 day body part split in which we do our heavy barbell lifts first (strength training) and then focus on lifts for hypertrophy and machines after we're spent on the weights. My lifting buddy's form is flawless and he's been an awesome resource and support. 

As far as diet goes, make sure to get a lot of fat in there too.  

My diet is for a lazy person that pretty much just understands calories in and out; I suggest you do better than me.  

I have base meals I consume each day and change it up a little for one meal (sometimes two).  I buy all my base meals at Costco for cheap.

- [Breakfast 10 AM] 
A. Costco Blueberry Muffin: (Carbs) 612 Calories
[$7 for 12 (freeze them)]
B. Muscle Milk 3 scoops: (Protein)(Fat) 48 grams of protein

Total: 1

No Lunch 

- [Dinner 5 PM] 
Aim for 1000+ calories 
For instance: A Chipotle pork burrito with everything has 1135 Calories

- [8:30]
2 Cooked Cups of Organic Short Grain Brown Rice (carbs)

- [10:00]
A. 2 Cups of large curd cottage cheese (fat)
B. 1 1/2 table spoons of Metamucil Fiber.     

- [11:30 PM]
Muscle Milk 3 scoops: (Protein)(Fat) 48 grams of protein

Total Calories: 3949
Total Protein: 218 grams

I've pretty much been doing this for 6 months now and more repetitive meal patterns the previous 6 months.  I hate making food and I hate cleaning it even more


Now for my story: 

A year ago I decided I wasn't going to finally fill out by just sitting around doing my normal routine.  I'm not sure what finally pushed me to do it, but my 12 year old girl appetite holding me back.  And so I crafted a pretty lazy diet around that simple principle.  I really really do hate food after this bulk, I feel bad for fatties who do this for fun, god help them.

The great passion I have found in all of this is lifting.  Lifting is what has made this all bearable.  To all of you who want to get fit in your home if you are new

For instance, I had him watch me again, and he was like, never mind, I guess that's just how tall people with long arms do it.  He's now one of the people who I briefly talk to at the gym every time he's there.  

I want to build my body and increase my strength, and legs.  The accessories have done good things for my upperbody (chest, traps, and lats).

My numbers are meh: 

Squat - 280

Deadlift - 375

Bench - 215


By May or June I'd like to be at a 3 plate squat

I was always a smaller kid in my class. Around 5'10"", I would feel full to the point of nausea. I got depressed. I didn't know why I couldn't eat. Doctors told me I was healthy. I felt healthy even! But everytime I would look at food, or think about food, then would come the nausea. This lead to me smoking weed, getting drunk a lot of nights just to eat (obviously not healthy choices).

Fast forward to two months ago, to the amount of salt on my food, to the amount of ice in my water, anything! I was looking for any answer to my issues but I couldn't find one.

Then last Monday, and digestion overall. So I monitored how much I was drinking and figured around 64 oz a day. Little did I know I was drinking about half the recommended amount for a guy my size. So what have I done since? The past week I've around doubled my intake (drinking around 100oz a day now) and it has been a COMPLETE 180. I am hungry at almost all points of the day. I find myself thinking of food in a good light, actually wanting to eat (mind you I haven't felt like this since I was 18 and I'm 21 now). I'm finally happy in life, and I know it's still early, but it just feels so good! So good to get this off my chest, so good everything!

I know there are people still struggling. I talked to many people online when I was looking for help. Many of them were struggling with the same issues as me (not being able to eat, or gives one person the feeling the I have right now, I will be the happiest person in the world!

I'll cut to the chase with an album from January 2012 - April 2013

Here is me in High School &amp; January 2012 [@ 148](http://imgur.com/a/va3cp)

Here are the pictures i took 5 minutes ago [@185ish](http://imgur.com/a/TxDMI)

&gt;**stats**

- Bench 1RM 95lbs to 240lbs (230 - 3 second pause)

- Squat 180ish to 440 RAW

- Deadlift - 200ish to 469 RAW (no straps

- OHP - 60ish to 185lbs

- 54"" box jump

&gt;**goals for this year**

- 275 bench

- 475 squat

- 500 deadlift

- 200 OHP


&gt;**Workout Routine**

- started on a modified SS

- After about 2 months i started a monthly progression routine called Wendlers 5/3/1. This was sort of a mistake as when you're a beginner it's better to do a weekly progression routine

- the best routine is the one that you stick to and actually follow consistently. I think people get too caught up in trying to find the perfect routine. Hard work and consistency is way more important. As a basic guide 8-12 reps will get ya bigger


&gt;**Diet**

- the absolute reason how i accomplished what i did

- My main sources of protein were - Chicken Thighs, Whey Protein 2% milk and Soy milk

- My main sources of Carbs were - Rice

- My main fats were - Oils

- I ate a decent amount of Fast Food like maybe 5 times a week but really the only thing i'd eat was chicken fingers

- my favorite meals were BBQ's chicken on rice, Stirfrys, and this weird hamburger meal thingy i'd eat over rice. It basically was 1 pound of hamburger, veggies, soy sauce and eggs served over 1cup of rice. 

- i took 5g creatine daily, but it's not worth the money in my mind. If you want a quick pick-me-up go to your local drugstore and pick up caffeine tablets, 200mg is about the limit, however you can take as much as you want. My whey brand of choice is Gold Standard. 

**i'll tell you this right now, because it means you're not being serious, so save yourself the grief**

- i found the easiest way to consistantly reach my caloric/macronutrient goals was to eat basically the same thing every day

&gt;**TIPS**

- soy milk is a great alternative to regular milk. I think GOMAD is the most fucked up thing i've ever heard in my entire life

- yes deadlifts and squats build up your abs and core strength, ab wheels, planks are my favorite.

- do not ignore your glutes and hamstrings, glute/ham raises, lunges. Do that shit

- if you are just starting out

- **full fucking range of motion**, even if you curl without fully stretching and contracting the weight is almost a waste of time, and everyone is making fun of you behind your back because of it (people say you don't notice other people in the gym, that's a lie)

- don't be afraid to lift heavy if powerlifting is your thing

- don't be afraid of alcohol

- set goals,  you are wayy more likely to skip your workouts. Also if you have anxiety at the gym, this a good way to fix it. 

- yes, and those people only make up something like 1% of the population). Your skinnny because you don't lift, and don't eat...and no you think you eat a ton because you're full, but bulking means you eat until your full, and you do that 3-4 times a day.

- **i'll update this whenever it think of another helpful tip**

- for calf raises, then bouncing it up and down for 10 reps.

- for every lifts, you need to act like you are trying to push that weight through the roof. Not being explosive will cause you a lot of failed reps.

- don't be a douchebag and go around giving everyone advice. Even if your advice is 100% spot on

- i personally think you should be in the gym for 45-60 minutes if you are working hard

- BREATHE when you lift. Inhale on the negative

- socks

36 eggs

1 large white onion

2 green bell peppers

2 tomatoes

2 cans (4 oz each) diced green chiles

1 package of 20 frozen hashbrowns (they look like the mcd's ones)

Chop all veggies

Now, sausage) except the hashbrowns. I had to split into two bowls to do this cause it was so much fucking food. 

Cut a hashbrown in half and place it in the center of a tortilla. Use a half-cup measure to scoop the mixture on top of the hashbrown. Roll the burrito like this picture: http://static.home-ec101.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/How-to-Roll-a-Burrito.jpg

**EDIT: Routine and Diet:**

**ROUTINE:** I try to get to the gym 4-5 days a week. Sometimes 3, different exercises, etc. I always try to do different shit as much as possible. And I keep everything at 6-8 reps per set. I try to keep away from machines as much as I can, but I do use them a little. I like any freeweight based exercises, and I have been trying to stick to more olympic style lifts in the past few months. The most important thing is just making sure you *get to the gym* no matter how tired you are or how many lame excuses your mind conjures up. I realize this isn't a day to day breakdown of everything I do, but it's a set of guidelines I try to follow no matter what. (again, short on time


**DIET**:
This is a pretty confusing subject on this subreddit sometimes. You guys on here would consire this a *dirty bulk*, I do. I do eat shitty shit sometimes, but I think the important thing is to balance a lot of non-shitty shit. I eat a ton of sweet potatoes, chicken, and pasta. 

My average week day is something like this:

**Breakfast 6:30am:** Serious Mass protein shake (with whole milk), 2 eggo waffles, or a bagel. (although if I'm short on time I sometimes just do the shake and yogurt.)

**Before lunch (mid-morning) snacks ~10am:** 1 Clif bar (or builders bar)

**Lunch ~11:30am:** Usually I eat either: a subway sub

**Post-Lunch snack ~2 or 3pm:** Another Clif bar and an apple.

**-Around 4pm I eat the second half of lunch**

**-Work out around 6:30 - 7:30 or 8:00pm** - Immediately after workout

**~8:30 - 9:00 pm:** Dinner. Chicken breast with pasta


**WEEKENDS** - Weekends are what usually kill my progress a little. I'm always out with friends



Keep in mind, because I know my body very well. I know when to eat, how much to eat, and I can feel when I'm gaining or losing weight. I did some calculations based on that diet, and it looks like I'm around **3,750 - 4,500 calories per day**


I don't know what a ""macro"" is. I don't worry about being *too* *""dirty""* with my diet. I'm not one of those people who can write down every little thing I eat or do. I just know my body well enough. I make sure to keep myself balanced, unless you're trying to be professional.

ROUTINE
 I go 5 days a week for about 1.5 hours a day. Generally I lift heavy as possible while trying to get 6-8 reps for 3 sets.
Chest
 • Flat
Back 
• Dead lifts • Rows • Lat pull downs • Wide grip weighted pull ups
Shoulders 
• Shoulder press (Dumbbells or bar) • Arnold press at a lighter weight • A few cable work outs • Shrugs with Dumbbells or the Smith machine.
Legs • Squats • Leg press • Squats • Hamstring curls • Squats • Calf raises.. My gym has a few machines for calf workouts that I use. • SQUATS
Biceps
• Weighted chin ups • Hammer curls • Push ups • I'll also use the cable machines and do curls there • 21s
Triceps 
• Weighted dips • Skull crushers • Push ups • Tricep pull downs • Close grip presses
As far as abs I try to do them every 3 days.  I do mason twists

DIET:
I was really skinny from the start so I ate anything I could get my hands on.  My goal was to feel full all day.  It sucked at first but once you see gains it will motivate you.  I also did GOMAD for a month and a half and saw really good gains from it.  Now when I did it I didnt put on fat in one specific area it really just helped me fill out and look healthier (good genetics I guess).  I dont really want to add any more fat to my body so now I try to eat healthier. A lot of meats, milk, fruits and vegetables are all things I try to eat on a daily basis.

Supplements:

I take a weight gainer called Muscle Juice.  If I dont get enough calories for the day I'll mix this with a banana

I'm not looking to compete but I am looking to gain as much size as I can in, say 6-8 months, while keeping to a modest budget, allowing myself an enjoyable diet, working extended hours and enjoying social events. One of the things I'd look at is the fact that you can't be 4% BF and still go out with friends and have beers etc. It would be about which things need to be comprimised and essentially, is it worth it?

&gt; **Intro**


Found this sub over a year ago, then 182 -&gt; [around 188lb in four months.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/zterf/my_progress_this_summer_64_163188_lbs_in_4_months/) I then left for uni and started a strict diet eating the same thing, reaching around 200lb by December, 7 months in. I continued bulking until around mid feb (9 months) where I did not have any scales but I guess I was around 205lb. I decided to cut for the summer, and dropped down to around 195lb, realising I started cutting a bit too early I bulked again for a month and have since cut down to around 191lb. I went on holiday recently, which was why I cut and I was at the point of visible abs without tensing at 190lb. I also made sure I got photos the day before I left for holiday

&gt; **Stats**

* I have never tested my 1rm

* Bench - mostly used dumbbells so total weight was - 14kg(30lb) -&gt; 76kg(167lb). 

* Squat - smith machine to start with 20kg(44lb) 8 reps -&gt; 100kg(220lb) squat free weight - strict form.

* Deadlift - I started deadlifting 8 months in at 100kg(154lb) -&gt; 162.5kg(360lb) sumo deadlift. 

* OHP - 14kg(30lb) -&gt; 64kg(141lb) 

* Pullups - assisted (40kg) for 5 reps -&gt; 8 reps with full ROM (pause at bottom). 


&gt; **Initial routine for 8 months**


 The first 8 months I spent doing a full body workout three days a week. This used four main compound exercises

* Squat 3x12

* Bench 3x12

* OHP 3x12

* Assisted Pull-ups 3xfailure

* The accessory movements were a mix of - curls, assisted dips, incline bench, tricep extension and a few others that I cannot remember. 

The warmup and warm down was 5 minutes on a rowing machine at a decent pace (1000 metres in 5 minutes). 


&gt; **Routine for the past 5 months** 

* [This is a log of my last 5 months]( http://imgur.com/FLbtsQ1) - purple signals a start of a cut (500 cal deficit)


Although I added a lot of weight and gained a lot of strength following a 3 day routine, but I have definitely made much better progress aesthetically in this time. 

* I have logged every lift during this time

* You will notice that I haven't that much strength gains in this period

* I also made a huge effort to clean up my form. My squats went as high as 120kg(264lb) but I realised although I wasn't completely quarter squating I was still not below parallel. So I make sure I am deep now

* My low curl is because I normally do it at the end of a workout, z bar or dumbbells. 

* My pullups have not increased because I also made sure I was making a full ROM.  

* My routine changed slightly after my rest week

* I also added in a few ab exercises at this point

* I reduced my warm up warm down to 3 minutes row but at a faster speed at 3 mins for 800 metres. 


&gt; **Initial bulk diet**

Like many of the subs here, but definitely not enough for me at 6""4. 

* *First month* I didn't really know where to start, going from 163lb - 182lb. I didn't get fat enough to be annoyed by it, and I was much happier being at around that weight. I still ate chocolate bars, and started adding in things like bagels which could easily add an extra 1000cals to a day. Looking back I think I must have been at around 3k cals a day. 

* *Second-fourth month* I started eating a bit cleaner around this time, with lots of pasta. I also still had protein shakes and started adding in 4 slices of bread and peanut butter. 

&gt; **Fourth-ninth month** 


I got much stricter now, or anything most would consider 'bad'. My diet was now at around 3800-4000 calories a day. I did gradually increase my calories during this period by increasing portion sizes of my pasta. This would be my day:

* Bowl of oats

* ON protein shake

* 3 slices of ham

* 4 slices of bread with peanut butter.

* 2 bananas

* two handfuls of cashews.

* 7 crackers and cottage cheese

* 200g chicken

* Around 200g dry of pasta - around 600-700 cals of pasta.

&gt; **Bulking from the ninth month onwards** 

At this point I got super strict with my diet

* [Album of my food for the day - only missing a second apple](http://imgur.com/a/HxDb8)

&gt; **My cut during the 11th and 13th month diet**

I took out the peanut butter sandwiches

&gt; **Final comments**

* Start logging your lifts

* I only spent maybe 15 minutes a week focusing on abs

* I did drink maybe twice a month, I stopped drinking beer and went for vodka or another spirit with a diet mixer. 

* I also made sure I got 8 hours of sleep every single night.

* Only supplements I took was one scoop of ON protein per day. I have recently added creatine in the last month or so and I have noticed a bit of improvement. 

* To those on this sub that I see complaining that you are over six foot and your gains are harder,  that's when it matters!

* I only drank water

* My posture has also improved greatly

* The goal is to bulk for two months
Hopefully reach 1000 total within a few months then hopefully 500 deadlift within a year. 

* And yes

* Although the only cardio I have done during most of this time has been 3 minute speed rows 8 times a week, so I can eat a bit more as I still get hungry nowadays!

So today is my one year mark of lifting seriously. I've been lifting for a total of probably close to 3.5 years now

1. Tracked my calories/macros (IIFYM!)
2. Kept a regular gym schedule as best I could
3. Followed proper programming
4. Got into the big three lifts plus one I would personally consider a main lift

The first time I stepped into a gym or even working out in general was in Spring 2010, body weight stuff, and thought I could also curl my way to being aesthetic as fuark. In short, I was a fucking idiot, I saw some shitty noob gains, but no real increase in strength. If I recall correctly, around this time I was struggling to machine chest press 80lbs and I had no idea what the fuck a deadlift was.

I also never did legs.

August 2010 I left for the Army, body weight stuff, and mostly just push ups and sit ups; you know, real functional strength (Yeah, no).

When I was in AIT, with no idea what I was doing, proceeded to enter the gates of the fabled ""Snap City"". I heard an audible pop and a sharp pain in my lower back/right hip and dropped to the ground. I played it off as I didn't wanting to appear weak, thinking it was just a small injury due to my back/scoliosis. At the time it felt like, and sometimes still feels like, the right side of my hip is rotated out ahead of my body. I've gotten X-rays since then and all appears normal. However, during this time I swore I would never deadlift again. I was terrified injuring myself again and didn't want to risk anything.

After some recuperation, or at least the bench press and seated barbell shoulder press (Still hate it). Now that I look back at it, during this time I still had no real idea what I was. I don't recall working legs once, bench every couple of days, and doing P90x's Ab Ripper program. My bench was an embarrassing 115lb max, often setting 95lb for reps. I slowly progressed to 3x5 at 135lbs before graduating from AIT.

At this point I'm in Georgia, squatting, doing some small programming and making small progress. I was still an idiot though, I was so caught up in looks and appearance (Suffered from Body Dysmorphic Disorder, self diagnosed but either way, it sucked.) I was eating at a caloric deficit, though I didn't know it at the time, and in turn would be healthy. I also tried numerous thermogenic fat burners

* 5'8/150lbs (All numbers given in this format are 1RM unless stated otherwise)
* OHP: 0lbs (never tested)
* Bench: 160lbs
* Squat: 285lbs
* Deadlift: 50lbs (unofficially

End of 2011 I get separated from a lot of my good friends as I was switched units, was a challenge. I was pretty sedentary outside of mandatory PT and stuff till about mid 2012. My workout buddy had deployed, I was engrossed in League of Legends, and would often just order pizza and sit in my room on the weekends playing games with friends over Skype. This slowly led to a downward spiral, I'm sure many of you know I wasn't in too happy of a place during this time, and I'll leave it at that.

July 2012 I came home for a bit, some did both. But the big thing was, almost everyone grew up. This left a huge impact on me, and I wanted to change and grow up too. I wanted out of my hole and out of the shitty situation I was in. I started reading up on nutrition, programming, looking up videos on form, browsing forums religiously. Fitness and working out became a passion of mine very quickly. That second weekend in August marked my new beginning, B was Back/Biceps

I had been lifting serious for about three months now, slowly working my way up.

I quickly made good gains now that I was eating right and frequently lifting, but I wanted more. It was at this point I realized, I would never be able to give this up, even if I wanted to;

I didn't choose the gym life

At this point I was something like:

* 5'8/150lbs
* OHP: 0lbs (never tested)
* Bench: 215lbs
* Squat: 315lbs
* Deadlift: 385lbs

January 2013 I was back in the saddle, I went to the doctors immediately. I took it easy for a couple weeks, and also decided to change up my routine at this time. I opted for Jim Wendler's 5/3/1+BB and designed my workout around that, focusing on strength development first, and size as a second (powerbuilding).

On April 8th, squat, deadlift combined) after pulling a deadlift PR of 405lbs. During the past couple months I had been on a recomp diet (Leangains), which kept me fluctuating between 170lbs and 180lbs, but never really over that. I added OHP to my routine and had been doing it for a couple months. Soon my shoulders really developed, which were one of my weakest parts. I was sitting at around these numbers:

* 5'8/176lbs
* OHP: 135bs
* Bench: 240lbs
* Squat: 360lbs
* Deadlift: 405lbs

May 21st signaled my return to freedom, and with it being summer, sleep. I had a solid four months to just focus on my fitness, and that's what I did. I decided fuck the recomp; I wanted to bulk. I want to get strong as fuck, and I want to look like I am too – I wanted to be shredded and claim my spot in Brolympus, like Zyzz and the great gods of fitness had already done.

* My numbers at the time were:
* 5'8/175lbs (dehydrated/dried out)
* OHP: 160lbs
* Bench: 260lbs
* Squat: 410lbs
* Deadlift: 475lbs

Since then I've kicked myself into overdrive. I started eating around 4000cal a day, and sprints 6x a week as well. I'm in the gym for 2-3 hours a day, often pushing myself till I'm both mentally and physically burnt out, sometimes past that, but isn't that what it's all about?

So now that my first year as a disciple of iron has finished

* 5'8/192lbs (full of water)
* Bodyfat: ~13%
* OHP: 175lbs
* Bench: 315lbs (I think I can actually push more)
* Squat: 470lbs
* Deadlift: 515lbs
* Total: 1300lbs.

Here are the details

**Diet:** 40/45/15 macro split (protein/carbs/fat)

**Supplements:** Creatine, BCAA (In my protein), ZMA

**Work out:** 5/3/1+BBB

**Rest:** I sleep like 8-14 hours a day

**Motivation:** I lift to challenge myself. One of my core beliefs is that “there is no perfect, it's about beating the only person you need to ever beat; yourself. People talk shit, I talk shit, I talk a whole lot of shit, but when it comes down to it it's just that – Shit. It has no meaning, it has no meaning. You don't owe anyone anything, but you owe it to yourself to be the best you can be.

So you want to put on some muscle? That's good man

Diet: 
I did GOMAD for 2.5 months to gain half the weight during the second half of the year. In the beginning I relied on BSN true mass to fill in the gaps. Everyday I eat the same things to make it easy. I eat a lot of peanut butter,000 calories. My real secret to gaining is to drink your calories. Be it milk, protein shakes, or some kind of blender concoction with oats that's the way to go. If I drink 2 BSN true mass gainer shakes a day made with milk, frozen banana, and a big scoop of peanut butter that is over 2,000 calories I don't need to worry about. 

Training: I did a split body building routine. I find the best way to train for hypertrophy and mass is the 10-12 rep range with at least 3-4 sets per exercise.  I also add a lot of drop sets into my training as well as super sets between exercises. At the end of a drop set I like to do a burn set with light weight and high reps with no rest.

* DL:185-&gt;330 (x5)
* Bench: 155lbs-&gt;175lbs
* Dips: w/weight 45lbs-&gt;75lbs


December 2012- got on PHAT, especially while I was on my bulk. Did the typical 5 day split with very slight modifications (didn't do hack squats, squatted 3x5 instead). Never did AB workouts before but would do some hanging leg raises here and there.


Here are my lifts as of today 6/29/13-
Never maxed out my DL so I don't have an idea what that number is. 

* Squat: 350x4

* Weighted Pull Ups 3x5 w/50lbs
* Weighted Dips: 3x6 w/100lbs 
* Incline DB Bench: 90x5
* DB Bench: 100x3


Diet:
It all started in December 2012- bought a bag of ON Serious Mass. I highly recommend taking this
MYFITNESSPAL.COM and the App should be everyone's best friend. It is a great tool for tracking calories and only gets easier as you use it. It wasn't until I started tracking calories that I started gaining weight whenever I used to say that I had a hard time gaining weight. I started trying to eat 3400+ calories a day just eating whatever I could and trying to get in 1g protein/lb. Ate every single day
At the beginning of April 2013
Hopefully this can shed some light on what has worked for me and others that think they have a difficult time gaining weight. 
Btw- you shouldn't pay more than $50 for a 10lb bag of Serious Mass anywhere. Otherwise you are getting ripped off. The macro's in this are actually pretty good.

Bulking Foods: These foods helped me push my way over 3k cals per day while snacking through the day. I didn't drink milk b/c that shit makes me break out. 

*  PBJ Sandwhiches/PB scoops
*  ALMONDS- so dense
*  Serious Mass


Im planning on ending my cut this fall and starting another bulk

tl/dr: Started 145lbs

I had to go alone as I had almost little to none friends near my area that I can count on . It seems to be a silly fear and the thought having gone through 6 months with this fear is really silly .However 

How I did it ? 
I sought help .In reddit and outside .It has mostly got to do with the way I thought about this problem .A person who was qualified in helping people told me to imagine what it is like if I had no fear of going to the gym ,walk to the counter,walk inside of the gym,registering and going to the gym bench ,all these while imagining that I have no problem whatsoever and was relaxed.You should try it .
Fellow redditors helped eased it in by claiming nobody actually cares when you are in the gym and true enough when I entered the gym and started training ,since I was new there,they want to know who I am .Also,people inside were really kind ,the big guys who may have scared you in your thoughts were kind .Some redditors even encouraged going alone as you can manage your own schedule and you can have all the time to yourself in the gym .

I've always been pretty skinny due to the fact that I just don't eat a lot. Before gaining, I didn't eat a lot because I would get sick from gluten. 

Since cutting gluten out of my diet I can eat and eat and still not get full. It's pretty nice compared to eating a little bit and feeling bloated and nauseous. 

All my gains are gluten free and very light dairy. I eat a lot of nuts

This is the second time I've posted my progress here. The last time was about 8 months ago. The weight gain has slowed considerably since then, and Tough Mudder prep were the biggest hinderances in consistent gaining). If you're interested, my first post is here http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/121uxe/progress_8_months_151lb_173_lb_62_also_have_a/

Lift Progression (all 3x5 numbers):

1.5 years ago --&gt; 8 months ago --&gt; now

Squat 75 --&gt; 185 --&gt; 220 (265 max) (insanely bad progress with my squat. I've been trying to fix it but will probably soon seek some form checks. To make the long story short, leg press, assistance movements, and varied rep ranges, but nothing has helped me get past 2 plates consistently.)

DL: Never done (prob like ~80ish) --&gt; 195 --&gt; 315 (365 max)

Bench: 105 --&gt; 145 --&gt; 190 (205 max)

OHP: 45 --&gt; 90 --&gt; 110

Diet: nothing out of the ordinary here. ~150g protein and ~2700-3000 calories per day. Recently (2-3 months) I've taken a huge liking to Intermittent Fasting. The idea of it is you eat all your food in a 6-8 hour window in order to keep your inslulin from spiking too much throughout the course of the day. The reason I like it is because I get very tired after I eat, and I'll sometimes eat breakfast, or extend my food intake window from 8 hours to 10. If you wish to find out more for yourself, /r/leangains

Workouts: I started off just like most of us here, back/bis, legs, shoulders/core) and it's been working well for me. The only ""out of the ordinary"" part of my workout is that I've recently started to add Cleans which is something not a lot of people do. I love it because it's such a fun lift and you feel manly as fuck doing it. If your gym allows Oly lifts try it out - you won't be disappointed.

For all of you that are on SS, followed by a good morning at the top. With better core strength I could maintain much better form and continue progressing at a faster rate. I've started throwing in core work 1-2 times per week and I feel like it's helped all my lifts. It doesn't even take a long time - all I do is ab rollouts, planks, and hanging leg raises. I've also dropped a little bit of fat (as you can see from one of the pictures) while training for Tough Mudder and my Adonis Belt started juuuuuust barely peeking out. I doubt it would've made as big a difference had I not started doing abs.

Hopefully this serves as some inspiration to beginners that if I could gain weight

http://imgur.com/a/EEl38

I'm what you would call a ""hardgainer""

- Eat, if it didn't take 2.5-3min on high then forget about it. That will all have to change if you want to gain weight. I'm not one to count calories, so if you are indeed a hard gainer, eat everything you can find and worry about the healthy stuff later. Now that I have gained a lot of weight, I focus more on eating healthy, but when I was skinny...whatever i could find....I ate.

- Protein, after a workout, in the evening, and drink casein protein right before going to bed. It's a slower releasing protein and will hold you over for the night. (This can get expensive so be prepared to spend quite a bit on food/supplements). If your job requires a bit of cardio (mine did) I would also eat a Builder Bar (20g of protein each) every couple hours. Those are good if you don't have time to eat a meal as well. Also, be sure to drink your post-workout protein/weight gainer within 30min after you're done working out. Its when the body needs it, give it to your body.

- Biggest rule of all for hard gainers - No Cardio. I hardly did any cardio while i was trying to gain weight. If you are a hard gainer, but if you really can't gain weight, its what you gotta do. If you absolutely positively have to do cardio, then do HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). Basically doing short bursts of hard cardio, then longer periods of heart rate reducing cardio over and over. It's the best way to do it while trying to gain. I do jump rope HIIT exercises. Fact of the matter, you're going to gain fat, there's no way around it. If you're super skinny and trying to get big, your body's natural way of life will keep the fat down. I gained 40lbs of muscle

- I start off my mornings everyday with a protein shake and some fruit., vegetables, grilled things. I have also cut out soda completely and I try to keep my sugar intake down. The good thing about us hard gainers is we can have more cheat days than other people (I love cake). I'll still throw in my protein shakes throughout the day. Not weight gainers, just whey protein. The whey protein i use now is BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder. I do still use the BSN weight gainer as an after workout drink though.

- Other Supplements - Some people have different opinions, etc) in there to aid in the gaining process. I took Jack3d for a period of time....but it gave me the jitters, so I quit....comin up on 6 months clean. I now take Muscle Pharm Assault as a pre-workout drink 30min before i work out. I like it and the mango orange is the best i've tasted and it doesn't make me crazy.

- As far as a workout program is concerned, but you have to keep going. Once you do start to see results, you'll be hooked. Check out this website for a training program: http://www.simplyshredded.com/category/training/workout-programs

Just pick one and go with it, don't stop, even if you feel like you're not getting anywhere. Eat and get in the gym. Also after a couple months of doing the same workout program, switch it up. Pick something different that does different workouts on different days. You'll confuse your muscles and keep them growing.

And don't skip leg day....

I started with this [workout](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/criticalbench23.htm). I still pretty much only cared about bringing up my bench, and I started to make sure that I was getting enough calories everyday. A friend who had recently went through the type of transformation that I was looking to make recommended PHAT. Here's the [article] (http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) for anyone that hasn't seen it yet. So I started to do PHAT and that mixed with good nutrition allowed me to gain a lot of muscle. I made a couple switches to the workout. I swapped upright rows for dumbbell shrugs and rack chins for weighted pull ups on back/shoulders day. I also heavy deadlift and heavy squat once a week (one on each of the leg days and I take out the 6 sets of 3). At the beginning of the summer I wanted to switch it up so I tried [GVT] (http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/luis13.htm). Personally I didn't really like it because I thought that it was boring and the volume was awful. I only made it through 5 cycles of it and then I went back to PHAT.  

Side note: I see a lot of questions on here about people wondering whether or not they should do PHAT


Lifting numbers:

Bench: 1 x 100 to 2 x 200 (this is with dumbells

Squat: 1 x 100 to 3 x 265

Deadlift: Idk to 1 x 295

I know that my deadlift is really weak and that's because I literally didn't start consistently deadlifting until this summer. 

**Diet:**

My diet right now is not even close to as structured as it was during the school year, I would aim for approximately 3200 calories a day (70f/450c/200p). I try to eat fairly ""clean"" and the majority of my calories come from brown rice, milk, chicken, etc. If you guys want to know exactly what I eat,  I will post it, but there is a considerable amount of variation from day to day.

I don't think that my fat gains have been too bad (I estimate that I am probably somewhere around 13-15% body fat)

**Supplements:**

I take Muscletech Whey Protein. It is probably not the best quality protein out there but it is by far the cheapest. Also

Pre workout I take Beta- Alanine

Also


**Music:**

I saw someone post the music they like to listen to in a progress post the other day

This wasn't really a black/white transformation for me, then progressed to reading some fitness books and eventually joining a crossfit gym (where the ""after"" picture was taken). Generally, I do some sort of workout most days. Sometimes it's running or hill workouts, often it's a crossfit style interval type workout with pushups, pullups, squats, thrusters, shoulder presses

I actually didn't drastically change my diet. My challenge/goal is simply to eat plenty of good food. We all know what's good for you and what's not. (Junk food sucks, etc suck. Home made veggies and protein is good) I just try to eat a lot of good stuff, but don't sweat it too much.

I count this transformation as one of the 3 most important accomplishments of my life so far.  For all of you who are working at the same thing

I unfortunately don't have any pics of my starting point at 165 pounds.  If I had known what I was doing at the beginning

I started working out when I was 16 but really had no idea what I was doing- I just went to the gym once every couple of weeks with a buddy of mine and goofed around.  Mostly I was into things like mountain biking and hiking where light weight was an advantage so it never really bothered me to be so skinny.

When I was 18

Over the next 5 years, but then I got into BJJ and had to cut back down to 215 to make weight.  That's where I was at in the 2006 pic above.

One day in 2008 I was talking to a friend of mine about my frustrations

Me: ""Does that actually matter?""

I spent the next couple of months voraciously reading everything related to weight gain and hypertrophy that I could get my hands on.  I started studying anatomy and physiology on my own time so that I could understand journal articles.  I put a game plan together, with butter on it, and stayed so full that I literally had to have my wife tie my shoes.

This was one of the most exhilarating times of my entire life.

One day, but there I was.

I cut calories and lost 10 pounds

My entire life changed over those 8 months.  I became a different person.  People reacted entirely differently to me.  The weight was distributed so much differently on my body that I could feel a difference in the way I walked.  For the first time, or acting scared of me when they first met me.  I thought it was hilarious.

After that big bulk though, and then shifted my focus more into combat sports instead of lifting.  I spent maybe a few months a year back in the gym but never stayed focused long enough to make any major changes.  My weight bobbed around between 245 and 285 during this time.

I've spent the last 2 years doing competitive judo

It's basically a major mission in my life now to help the people around me make these kinds of changes in their own lives.  I spent SO FUCKING LONG thinking I was trapped in the body I had

So that's my story.  Along the way I've learned a LOT about diet, overtraining, cardio, cooking, etc. - ask me anything!

I see a lot of people struggling to eat to their 500 calorie surplus,500 calories to 3000 in one day and honestly that just won't happen.. In my inpatient treatment I was eating 6,000 calories, up from 800. How? The amazing doctors in the treatment center boosted my cals up 250-300 every other day.. This expanded my stomach and my appetite. Now downing 3,000 calories is very easy.

The fact of the matter is,500 to 3,000+ or you will just feel sick and won't be able to move. Just boost gradually and eventually you'll get there. I discussed something with a member today about how he ate fruits, which are extremely filling. Honestly I include greens and fruits into my diet, but just eating those won't get the job done. I include poptarts whenever I need the carbs/calories, it's very easy and non filling. That is why I like IIFYM diet.

To be perfectly honest, I guess that’s just a benefit of being young. I just tried to get around 250-300 grams of protein a day and just ate whenever I felt I had an empty stomach. It was definitely a dirty bulk though. I apologize that I can’t be more specific.

I'm ancient - 27 years old and I'm still in my ""before"" pics. 6'0"" 155lbs. Guess how depressed I am about it? Not one fucking bit.

I used to get down on myself for not going to the gym and eating the necessary calories to gain weight. The only thing worse than being skinny is knowing your lazy ass is to blame. 

Recently I realized my own thoughts were sabotaging me. Every time I would get pumped to gain weight, etc. Does this happen to you?

You see, inevitably, I was the scrawniest of the bunch and I'd say ""I'm going to try again. I'm going to get huuuuuge!"" Rinse. Repeat. For 10 years.

Then as Jan 1 2013 rolled around, ""What if I had just worked out twice a week, every week, since I was 17? Where would I be now?"" 

That changed everything. My New Years resolution was  set. I committed to working out at least twice a week for the rest of my life. By the time I die I will have gone to the gym every single week. 

This creates an amazing freedom in your life, and you'll adjust. 

Now I take pride in the ritualistic packing of my duffel bag the night before a gym day. I smile at the grocery store when I'm picking out sweet potatoes and grabbing a box of frozen chicken. And I can't tell you

For most of my 'youth' I was very insecure about how skinny I was

Soon after I turned 22, was as skinny as I was but was now well on his way to being 'built'. With his help, and a LOT of research into both nutrition and weight lifting, I began my journey into improving myself. Weight lifting and nutrition are now my main hobbies, and I'm becoming more passionate about it as time goes on.

When I started I was about 145lbs, playing volleyball and doing long distance running (10km was my preferred distance), I would only occasionally lift weights. I stopped running altogether when I started trying to gain weight seriously, I started eating 3+ meals a day plus 3 protein shakes a day (morning, pre, and post workout) and 1 very large serving of cottage cheese every night before bed (yogurt or maple syrup often mixed in for flavour). 

Initially my gym routine was a bit all over the place

After 6-8 months of the Max OT style training I met a power-lifter at my gym and started doing Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength. I wish I had started with SS because I got some pretty amazing results, though was carrying a bit of extra fat around with me, so I decided to cut a bit of weight for the summer. 

I found cutting to be extremely easy, and stuck to a low-crab, mostly paleo style diet. I now weight just over 185lbs and plan on starting my 'bulk' again soon. Hopefully hitting around 220lbs this winter before cutting again next summer. My ultimate goal is to reach about 210lbs at 10% bodyfat... but to never stop getting stronger after that.

General tips for going to the gym: (a lot of these you may have heard before

- Leave your ego at the door: in the beginning you may feel self-conscious about being skinny/weak... but you're at the gym to get stronger. I respect anyone who is making the effort to go the gym and better themselves.
- High weight
- Lift heavy, but if you push yourself with improper technique it can be downright dangerous... injuries can sideline you for months (or permanently).
- Get a gym buddy: Good for spots/safety
- Drink lots of milk!

**Routines and diet**

* Routines

    Started off by doing Starting Strength to build a base upon which to bulk.  

    My lifts increased dramatically during this time:

Deadlift 60kg/132lbs - 110kg/242lbs  
Bench Press 45kg/99lbs - 65kg/143lbs  
Squat 55kg/121lbs - 95kg/209lbs  

I've since moved on to [THIS](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beginner-to-advanced-bodybuilder-in-12-weeks.html) routine

* Diet 

    Consume roughly 3000-3500 calories per day. Still finding it difficult if I'm having a busy day as I try not to get the calories from majorly unhealthy sources and this can mean that meals are bigger and take more preparation due to this fact.  
Its not a dirty bulk

A typical days food:  
**Breakfast -** Three or four large eggs scrambled on four slices of wholemeal bread. Might put cheese on it. Pint of orange juice and an apple.

I've always been very lean and scrawny. Got tired of it and started to do something about it. I think my biggest problem was not eating ENOUGH! And also the biggest reason I gained around 10 pounds in a month. My diet consisted with eating more. But more of the RIGHT foods, chicken, tuna, bacon, steak. But getting the intake of calories that I needed per day. To get that edge I consumed a protein shake in the morning and right before I went to bed. I usually work out at night.

My starting weight was 139 and I just weighed in at 150 yesterday. I stated before that I did not use a gym to work out. The following link describes my workout that I did at home. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n3mbzcRHj8 .... I do have a bench but I have JUST started using it. I recommend HIGHLY doing pull-ups. They are fantastic. 

So here's what I look like then and now. Be nice! Any pointers would be appreciated!

Updated: Average Day Meals

Okay... Just got back from work. I got off at 10 pm today so it's a little late and I wasn't expecting this to get up-voted as much as it did. But first you MUST understand that I was barely eating much at all before I began my journey to gain more weight and muscle mass. I was eating maybe only 2 descent sized meals a day. So... that out of the way I will give you a round about what I eat a day.

In the morning I try to eat a good breakfast... Cereal

My next meal is about 3 to 4 hours later. We'll call it brunch. I'll regularly eat a sandwich consisting of different meats maybe chicken some pork provolone cheese. It's pretty packed. The bread is potato bread. I also eat a banana and an apple with some cashew nuts or pistachios.

Another 3-4 hours later I usually go to subway which is right next to the place I work and order a cheese steak packed with bacon, ketchup, and Parmesan cheese. Sometimes I get 2 chocolate chip cookies because they are pretty good. I'll either get a 6 inch or a foot-long. I'm usually drinking water or juice for my last 2 meals.

Another 3-4 hours later I'll have something random for dinner. Might be some pasta dish or flounder or maybe 2 hamburgers.... Random dinners. Sorry I can't be more specific.

I mentioned in my main post that I usually work out at night. So at least 15 mins after I workout I'll drink another 12-16 ounce protein shake combined with a good ole' peanut butter sandwich that's on potato bread. I usually get the Reese's peanut butter.

Any more specifics that I might of left out.... just ask.

1315544193.0,k9pfn,Ready to get your gains?,krugnasty,104,17,43,"All right people I have some helpful tips to help you on your way to get a bulky physique we all desire. One thing I want to say upfront is that there is no PERFECT diet

**Food prep**: Ok go check your cabinets if you do not have these you are missing out. Get a George Foreman fucking **ASAP** these things can let you cook massive amounts of your protein sources in fucking minutes so you can refrigerate that shit and enjoy later. Get a fucking Rice cooker (preferably a large one that can handle 10-12 cups of rice) they go for like $20-$30 at costco or sams club. You can cook massive amounts of rice for the entire week and just microwave it for a one minute and baby you got rice cookin. The last thing I recommend is a decent blender, one scoop of your fave protein, 2 tbsp of peanut butter, and a banana. Fucking delicious.

**Food**: Wanna get big on the cheap? Get a membership to costco or sams club. This will save you a SHITTON of money. Buy in bulk to -put on bulk. If you cannot get a membership to one of these you can still stay cheap and get huge. **#1** Buy the shit out of eggs. Buy 5-6 dozen at one time they go for $1-$2 (costco $3.39 for 36 eggs). **#2** Buy oats. No that quaker apple and cinnamon shit, fucking pounds, for $8. Havent gotten it from walmart in awhile so i forget how much it is there) so you can add a packet of splenda or some honey in the morning. **#3** Tuna. Nuff said. **#4** Get the little bags of brown rice at walmart for like $1.33 throw that shit in your rice cooker and you got yourself an awesome carb source. **#5** You need frozen chicken breast you can get 10lbs of this at costco for $20. it will easily last you two weeks. **#6** Get whole wheat bread none of that enriched shit that is simple carbs and that is no bueno you want stone ground or whole whole grain look at the ingredients on the back to make sure you know what you are getting. **And #7** Organic peanut butter. Calorie dense and great source of protein and good fats. After eating this stuff for a bit you wont want to go back to Jiffy or Peter Pan bullshit.

**Supplements**: First and foremost, pound this with a glass of your favorite juice and you will start making some serious fucking headway. When buying protein make sure that you get a Low temperature processed protein so that way the protein you are taking in is not denatured and you get most if not all of the protein that is stated on the nutrition facts. 

**Eating schedule**: Try and eat 5-6 times a day make each meal 2-3 hours apart. This will keep your metabolism fired the fuck up and burn up all sorts of shit you put in your stomach so that it doesn't end up as fat but used as fuel for your body. Now, it is the worst feeling, I do it about every morning and you just gotta get through it. It fucking sucks but once you start putting on some size you wont regret it. **YOU CAN** eat carbs before you go to bed (I would not recommend this if you are cutting bodyfat and even then its still ok) eat a peanut butter sandwich and milk before you go to bed. **1 gallon of water per day** no excuses drink it. Now if you want nothing else but to put on size, drink a lot of water before you go to bed so that you get up in the middle of the night and pound a protein shake before you go back to sleep to keep you body burning through food.

**Lifting**: To get bigger this is what I recommend 12-16 sets for large body parts (chest, bi's and tri's) shoot for 8-12 reps for size. (4-6 reps are usually for strength and 15+ is for endurance). Incorporate these in to your workout. Squats ( a fucking must), dips for chest and tris, and pull ups (get them lats brah) These are incredible mass builders. Keep your workouts to 60-90 minutes and keep the workouts INTENSE (less than 1 minute between sets and 1-2 minutes between exercises). If you don't feel like you need to vomit, you're doing it wrong.

That is about it for right now. I'm open for questions and possibly some requests if you want some personal help. GET HUGE R/GAINIT! DO IT FOR YOURSELVES!

P.S. sorry for shitty picture quality on the befores. My better half decided that taking a picture of the computer screen and sending it to me would work better than just sending me the actual picture.

**EDIT**: My diet and workout really weren't complicated. I tried to eat between 3000-4000 calories a day with my main focus on protein and carbs. All I did was get about 2 or 3 pounds of meat, subway for lunch almost every day, and entirely too much heavy-ass beer.

Examples of meals: 

cheeseburgers

1.5 lb steak w/6 eggs and 2.5c cooked rice (2272 calories

rice and chicken (again

pork chops and spaghetti

family size hamburger helper (1650 cal

stouffer's frozen lasagna (1450 cal

1 dozen eggs and 2 cans of spam (3320 cal

I've been eating entirely too much sodium but it's already pretty tough to get enough food without worrying about it. I ate 3-4 meals per day and didn't/don't take protein powder or mass gainers.

As for my workout

MWF: 

Bench 5x5

Pullups 3x8

Incline 5x5

High pulls 3x8

Decline 5x5

Bent-over rows 3x8

Dips 2 sets to failure

TTH:

Squat 5x5

DL 3x5

Front squat 3x8

sometimes Leg Press 3x5/5x5 depending on how I feel

Those are just the basics that I did every day. Of course I added in some accessory work and stuff

One year ago

Luckily i had a gymbuddy to go with, age 21, and decided to show you my progress.

*Before:* http://imgur.com/a/XeaDy

*After:* http://imgur.com/a/KtQU7


&gt; **Nutrition:**

To this date i still struggle to get enough calories in
I only drink 1 shake a day right after my workout
I never really counted calories

Things as eating a few spoons of peanut butter before bed and pouring some olive oil in my post-workout shake are becoming a habit.

I used to drink lots of milk but i had the feeling this was causing acne
What i haven't cut back on is alcohol although I am aware that the hangovers this has caused might has set back my progress a little. 

&gt; **Sources of advice:**

* First of all the /r/gainit and /r/fitness community
* Various people on youtube: twinmuscleworkout, PhysiquesOfGreatness and since recently CTFletcher.
* More experienced people at my gym.

&gt; **Problems along the way:**

* Shoulder issues; started feeling a kind of burning feeling in my left rear deltoid area after barbell bench press. Only lasted a few minutes and didn't interfere with my RoM but it still worried me a bit
	I switched over to dumbbells for a while

* Food.

* Tingling sensation in the middle of my back

&gt; **Best for me (maybe tips for everyone?):**

* Form above all; I don't mind looking like a weaker person in the gym as long as I can do safe form and full RoM.
* Make that mind-muscle connection; Especially during back workout this makes a big difference for me.
* Watch your breathing; When i just started i didn't really think about my breathing
* Don't be afraid to ask for advice; Most people in the gym are happy to help you
* Cliché: Put your ego aside in the gym; Who cares what people think of you as long as you're happy with what you're doing. 

&gt; **Routine:** Every exercise and weights are 3 sets (sometimes 4 on specific ones) of 10 reps
4 Days:

Day 1: Chest &amp; Biceps

* Flat dumbbell bench press - *4x 60kg -&gt; 132lbs*
* Dumbbell bench press at a different angle
* Dumbbell flys *4x*
* Chest Dips till failure
* Cable flys
 	
(Bicep workout varies most of the times

* Dumbbell bicep curl *4x*
* Barbell curl
* Dumbbell preacher curl


Day 2: Back

* Pull ups till failure - *4x*
* Behind the neck lateral pulldowns
* (Deadlift) (Once every 2 weeks) - *4x 90kg -&gt; 198lbs*
* One arm dumbbell rows - *4x*
* Cable rows
* Machine bent over rows
* Machine rows
* Weighted Hyperextensions *10kg* 

Day 3: Legs

* Squats - *4x 90kg -&gt; 198lbs*
* Leg extensions
* Lying leg curls
* Leg press *3x 130kg -&gt; 286lbs*
* Calf raises till failure *6x*

* Front raises
* Seated rear felt face pulls
* Tricep pushdown *4x*
* Skullcrushers
* Varies: dropset pushdowns or another triceps exercise

Abs

* Cable crunch
* Hanging leg raises
* Decline crunch

&gt; **Future goals:**

My goal from the beginning was reaching the 70kg milestone. 
Once i've reached that i might start doing some cardio to work on my endurance.

Sorry about the weird formatting...I clearly don't post very often.  This was over the course of a little over six months.  I had been lifting weights regularly prior to the original picture

I'm 23 years old and 6'1"".  I don't think this will be very popular

Edit: 
Lifting Stats (I could estimate 1RM's but who really cares about those)  Program was SS as mentioned above:
* Before:
Squat: 135x5, OHP:55x5
* Current:
Squat: 260x5, OHP: 145x5

Everything has been slowing down quite a bit lately

Diet:  Nothing too strict about it as far as macronutrients go, but I think I have a good sense for the amount I need to eat. The actual foods I eat the most are mixed green salads with plenty of meat and cottage cheese, more cottage cheese (seriously, all the time), oatmeal mixed with whey and PB for breakfast, Greek Yogurt and granola for snacks, and lots of canned chicken.  I eat very little fruit

Other tips:  Eat more than you think you should

People love looking at good progress pictures. People new to gaining can stand to learn many things from some of the more experienced members around here. Also

**Premise**

The format will be a bi-weekly thread (posted Mondays) highlighting a different r/gainit member every iteration. The person in question will answer a short questionnaire, which this person will (hopefully) answer. In this way, each thread is essentially an AMA for the highlighted person.

**Philosophy**

The idea of this spotlight is to highlight active members of this community; those who contribute regularly. It is not meant to be a soapbox for those who otherwise contribute nothing to the sub. As such, I won't allow it. TL;DR: Active redditors only.

We also want to see real progress. I'm not going to put in a weight gained requirement

**Nominations**

Anyone here can nominate anyone else who falls under the above guidelines, with pictures. I will then post the thread at a future date (and give the nominee advance warning so they can be active in the thread and answer questions). Note that you can nominate as many people as you want, whenever you want.

**Requirements**

* The nominee must be someone other than yourself.
* The nominee must have at minimum two photos. One ""after"" picture that clearly shows the development in the upper body **and** legs. Then, the more photos the better. If you have photos from in between, by all means, include them. Feel free to blur out faces and identifying marks (eg, tattoos).
* The nominee must be present to answer questions in their thread. Don't worry

**Final Thoughts**

Sorry for the stringent rules

So depending on the amount of nominations, I probably won't be able to respond to all of them. But rest assured, I probably got your message.

I always heard people tell me to go to the calorie calculators to figure out what I should be eating for maintenance

I also had a hard time eating a lot of food. I even tried the GOMAD diet, while I cook, or if nothing in my pantry/fridge looks tasty. **Tip 2: Try to eat as much food as you can during the day. Use GOMAD as your fall back if you're low on food, can't decide what to eat, don't feel like cooking, etc.**

Also, I know that even if I don't actually reach my calorie goal per day, I will finish off the day with a serving of Serious Mass which pushes me over the edge. I don't rely on this, but it is nice to have that cushion at the end of the day. **Tip 3: Get a mass gainer and save it for the end of the day. If you end up not reaching your calorie goal, add one of those on to your day before you go to bed. Liquid calories are easy to take down, no matter how full you are.**

Last, be stronger, etc. While that may work for some people, it didn't for me. I'm not gaining weight for health reasons. I know I will be healthier with more weight. I know it's better for my body to have more muscle than I do now, and it also pushes me to go to the gym more often. **Tip 4: Find your own motivation, and make it real. Find something that (almost) forces you to do this, solidifying your WANT to do this.**

I hope this helps those that are having trouble or needed another push to get going.

tl;dr: Here are my personal tips for gaining weight. Basically,,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,True

I've been following this subreddit for some time and actually posted my progress a few months back.  I've hit my goal weight (up 40 lbs) so I thought I'd post again to show my progress since my last post.  Any questions/criticism are welcome.

Edit: Thanks for the all the interest and support everyone. I will add my diet

Edit 2: 
ROUTINE
 I go 5 days a week for about 1.5 hours a day. Generally I lift heavy as possible while trying to get 6-8 reps for 3 sets.
Chest • Flat
Back • Dead lifts • Rows • Lat pull downs • Wide grip weighted pull ups
Shoulders • Shoulder press (Dumbbells or bar) • Arnold press at a lighter weight • A few cable work outs • Shrugs with Dumbbells or the Smith machine.
Legs • Squats • Leg press • Squats • Hamstring curls • Squats • Calf raises.. My gym has a few machines for calf workouts that I use. • SQUATS
Biceps • Weighted chin ups • Hammer curls • Push ups • I'll also use the cable machines and do curls there • 21s
Triceps • Weighted dips • Skull crushers • Push ups • Tricep pull downs • Close grip presses
As far as abs I try to do them every 3 days.  I do mason twists

DIET:
I was really skinny from the start so I ate anything I could get my hands on.  My goal was to feel full all day.  It sucked at first but once you see gains it will motivate you.  I also did GOMAD for a month and a half and saw really good gains from it.  Now when I did it I didnt put on fat in one specific area it really just helped me fill out and look healthier (good genetics I guess).  I dont really want to add any more fat to my body so now I try to eat healthier. A lot of meats, milk, fruits and vegetables are all things I try to eat on a daily basis.

Supplements:

I take a weight gainer called Muscle Juice.  If I dont get enough calories for the day I'll mix this with a banana

Post work out I take Torrent.  It's a bit pricey but me and most of my buddies will swear by it.  Definitely check it out.

**Diet &amp; Lifting Routine**

As for diet goes I basically started counting calories and tried to eat as much as I could. My TDEE was a little under 3000, 2 scoops ON protein powder, 1 cup of Greek yogurt, and some milk and almond milk. It came out to about 800 calories, and I have been drinking this shake everyday until recently. Besides that I just tried to hit my calorie goal for the day, and I tried to buy things with protein in them and high calories. I ate a lot of nuts, bagels, I'll probably continue taking it for the rest of my bulk

**My routine** was a 3 day split with 

* Day 1: Chest/Triceps/Shoulders 

* Day 2: Bicep/back

* Day 3: Legs and abs

* Day 4: Rest if I feel I need it

I basically just found various exercises online and made a routine from them, since I have been training them however, I have noticed some nice gainz. Unfortunately I go to Planet Fitness, so I cant do a lot of exercises, I plan to start going to my University's gym in the fall when it is free again. They should have more equipment and I'll be able to do deadlifts, and free bench/squat. 

 * **Edit Stating weight 155 Current weight 175 Goal weight 185**

So I've never been able to gain weight before this year, and even when I reached 6’0” I still weighed 149. I have always been in great shape, but was always been embarrassed at how skinny I was. When I took off my shirt at the beach, you could see abs, but you could also see my ribs through my chest. After I graduated a year ago, I knew I would have a gap year before I started grad school in the fall of 2013. I knew if I wasted this year and started grad school without changing my appearance, I would never set aside the time to do so, I decided to finally change all of it. I started lifting weights 4-5 times a week

7-day schedule (while employed)
-----
Monday: Chest/Back
Tuesday: Shoulders/p90x's Ab Ripper x (a 15-min ab workout at home)
Wednesday: Legs
Thursday: Ab Ripper x
Friday: Biceps/Triceps
Sat &amp; Sun: rest

(here's a link to the ab ripper video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qghZZ9yopno)

I did a lot of research on the best ways to bulk for people who aren’t also trying to cut fat, I had more time to work out every day, so I changed to a 5 day schedule:

5-day schedule
-----
Day 1: Chest/ab ripper x
Day 2: Shoulders (a.m.)/Back (p.m.)
Day 3: Legs/ab ripper x
Day 4: Biceps (a.m.)/Triceps (p.m.)
Day 5: Rest

So here's the schedule of exercises I’ve done for each workout. Every exercise I do in every workout, but I really like it. And I would choose the weight so that I'm having to struggle to get the 10th, but not until then.

Chest:
Flat bench press
Incline bench press
Decline bench press
Chest Flyes

With each of these chest exercises, and you can bring them together at the top in order to squeeze your chest muscles and work them harder, which you can’t do with a bar.

Back:
Bent-over dumbbell rows
Shoulder shrugs with dumbbells
Seated machine rows with a pulley machine
Lat pull-downs with pulley machine
Back extensions on machine

Shoulders:
Seated dumbbell shoulder presses
Standing front shoulder raises with dumbbells
Standing side shoulder raises with dumbbells
Reverse Pec-Deck Flyes

Legs:
Squats (on a free bar/squat rack
Calf raises (either on a machine or squat rack)
Leg extensions on machine
Leg curls on machine
Anterior leaning lunges
Leg Presses

Biceps:
Dumbbell curls
Seated Preacher curls with a bar
Hammer curls with dumbbells
Seated dumbbell isolation curls

Triceps:
Laying down tricep extensions with dumbbells
Tricep pushdown with pulley machine and rope attachment
Tricep kick-backs
Tricep dips (either on a machine

So if you have the time to go to the gym twice a day on the days with 2 exercises, then it seems to be best to split it up so that you do one muscle group a day, but only have 1 rest day at the end of the week or something, if that makes sense.

If you only have time to go to the gym 3 or 4 times a week, if you’re doing biceps/triceps at the same time, you can do bicep curls, move to tricep extensions, then back to bicep curls, then tricep extensions, etc. until youve done 4 sets of each

As far as protein/supplements, and here's the schedule I came up with, so that I'm either eating a meal or drinking a protein shake every 2-3 hours: right when I wake up I drink a whey protein shake (chocolate has always tasted the best to me), you can get them at wal-mart for like $16 for 2 lbs of it. With the shake I'll take a multivitamin, some glutamine and some branched chain amino acids (both are in pills like a vitamin), and a fish oil pill. Then in a bit I’ll have breakfast, then in between lunch and when I work out I'll have a protein shake and add in 5 mg of creatine. Then I'll work out, and either dinner or a protien shake. Then another protien shake immediately before bed. I’ve aimed to eat/drink 1 g of protein for each pound that I’ve aimed to weigh. I’m planning on continuing to bulk until around 185 lbs

Well that’s about all I can think of that I’ve done/found to work. So after all of this, let me know! Or if you have any advice on things you would change in order to help me keep up this progress, I'd love to hear it!

My thoughts:

* Take photos the day you decide to start lifting
* Try to get on free weights as soon as possible
* Avoid the smith machine if you can help of it
* Try to log what your starting lifts were
* Don't be scared of the deadlift
* When buying your gym clothes
* The same goes for any clothing in the first few months
* Gym footwear, try and get a firm heeled shoe - chucks or converse are fine.
* Your legs aren't big from all that cycling and football you play
* Chances are you are quarter squating
* Do not tell anyone that you are planning to gain weight
* Practice good form on the squats
* Do not worry that others are doing a four day split or something else
* If you are struggling for calories

For the first month I gained a lot of fat

Currently my meals include 

**Breakfast:** 2-5 eggs. 5 Large Strawberries. A banana. Blueberries. Large spoonful of peanut butter. Large glass of milk.

**Lunch:** .75lbs of chicken cooked in olive oil. I try and be lighter on the salt with seasoning. A garden mix of greens topped with olive oil balsamic vinegar. Tomatoes added. 3 or so strawberries on the side. Water or milk. Depending on how I feel about my intake lately.

All told I put down about 3000-3500 cals a day. 

I haven't been on the Whey Protein for a while

So thats it. I lost a ton of weight once I started up college and my focus changed. I went from 5'10"" 160 to 6'0"" 140 in a few years time. Luckly I had that experience so I knew what it took to get back into the swing of things. I don't see myself stopping my progress. I'd like to be 185lbs within a years time. Hopefully just as lean or leaner. Maybe then I'll make a second post. Feel free to ask me anything at all! I'm nowhere near done and you guys help keep my motivated! Thanks for reading!

My lifting routine
http://imgur.com/39vP8Ao
I have only been doing this routine for 2 months. The first month I was doing a 4 day split.
I try and add 2.5lbs to upper body and 5lbs to lower body excersices each work out. But since I don't have the option to add 2.5lbs evenly on the bar I just add 5lbs every other time I do those exercises.

My current numbers are
185lbs squat
120lbs bench
100lbs barbell row
75lbs OHP
145lbs DL

My diet consists of a lot of chicken, and milk. I have a lot of food allergies so I'm limited to what I can eat. Breakfast at 5:15am I eat a big bowl of Greek yogurt with fiber one cereal mixed in and a banana. Second breakfast at 8-8:30am, 2 chicken thighs and about 3/4 can of pinto beans and about 30oz of whole milk. Lunch at 11:30am usually a foot long meatball sub or double meat turky sub from subway. Days I go to the gym, I get an extra 6"" sub and eat that at about 3:30-4pm. Days I don't, I'll just drink about 20oz of milk at that time. After gym at about 7pm I eat about a 1lbs steak, or some chicken with close to a whole can of pinto beans and a large glass of whole milk. And before bed at around 9pm pretty much anything I can that doesn't require cooking. 

Any questions or comments would be appreciated!

Edit: I'm doing the second version of the lifting routine.
Edit 2: the numbers are my weight I do reps with. I haven't checked my 1RM in a while.

Growing up

It all started with my freshman crush, why?  I started to go down a road of slight depression.  It wasn't till a buddy of mine invited me to the gym for the first time  that I started my climb out.  

It started with that typical starter mentality of ""I'll work out a bunch and then I'll have to get big.""  I took no time to look at my diet and actually plan out a program.  I had no time to learn

About 6 months after started, but it was a slow crawl.  

I'm now 2 1/2 years into my fitness journey and it has become something that I will take with me for the rest of my life. I do not see me stopping anytime in the near future.  I just hope I have a similar story to someone else.

Relatively new to this subreddit but I’ve been trying to gain for about two years

It’s been a bit of a complicated/unconventional road. I started off quite thin and unhealthy. I have abnormally long arms which is lets say... challenging

At 31 a friend (equally skinny) and I started going to the gym very casually, and I had critically low energy at this time in my life. Deep down  knew I couldn’t stick with it, it was too busy, too expensive, and too inconvenient for me to really commit to going regularly. We were discussing how there had to be a better way to get fit at home without a lot of money and space consuming equipment. A few weeks later he mentioned hearing about the book Convict Conditioning on reddit. I was very quickly addicted to bodyweight training, the philosophy really appealed to me. (simple, free, and in my mind fitness should be all of those things)

So that summer (2011) I started bodyweight training as suggested in CC

I had no idea how to eat at the time so 6 months in I had barely gained anything, absurdly low. I ramped that up, nothing hugely complicated, just targeting 2200 at first, I only tracked for awhile to get an idea what was necessary, but it was enough.

Workouts

I stuck with convict conditioning for most of this time, and one day for handstand pushups and bridging. 

I’ve experimented with bodyweight666 and most recently the /r/bodyweightfitness subreddit

I love CC but also have some criticisms of it. I took my time with it, especially with my body type. Some of the rep ranges are completely out of wack and it’s very de-motivating to spend a year or more working out and not be doing full pushups, or completely unable to get a pullup. (that took me a year and a half to get a clean rep) On the other hand though, I did gain mass, and I have never injured myself.

I can’t give my current “lifts” obviously. :) I don’t train for volume but currently am working on diamond pushups with the end goal being a 1 arm pushup, full back bridges, pike/box handstand pushups, easier forms of dips, and what CC calls “uneven squats”, basically starting to transition to 1 leg pistol squats.

Diet

I’ve had stomach trouble my whole life. I don’t know how common this is for “hardgainers” but I didn’t eat enough because I found no joy in doing so, etc. Doctors have never been able to give me any effective guidance with this.

When I started out I was already on a diet without lactose, pork/chicken/fish, and salad, I just focused on eating more of it. I found an all natural whey protein at GNC with nothing weird in it which was a major help, great in a berry + OJ smoothie. Snacks were usually potato chips and granola bars. I gained about 20 lbs on this diet.

Late in 2012 though the stomach problems started to increase quite severely

This sucks because it rules out a ridiculous amount of modern food, regular iodized table salt, all kinds of strange vitamins and additives they cultivate with potato, not to mention everything with sugar in it. I literally have to skip 90% of what you’d find in a supermarket. If it’s in a box/bag, it will almost always have some form of sugar or potato additive. 

I took a leap of faith and tried to cut it all out though. I had nearly immediate improvements, something I’d *never* done before. Energy spiked quite nicely, started bouncing back from workouts much better, sleeping a little less, overall a big improvement, so (unfortunately) I am nearly positive she was right.

So while my diet is now *extremely* restricted and very expensive (we generally try to eat organic / hormone free / etc), rice, meat/fish, whey protein smoothies, and some granola bars that have no refined sugar which are a little tough to find but they are out there. I started doing things like mixing some coconut oil into my green tea for a little bonus, olive oil + lemon juice to flavor rice and meat/fish, drinking more fruit juices, I don’t track every day but only occasionally to make sure I’m in the ballpark

I have mixed emotions on the results at times, but there’s still a lot of work left to do. I’m learning to think of  those long arms as just more room for muscle. I am hopeful that chinups/pullups will be the answer for the arms, still not strong enough to do full versions of these regularly.

I have grown to love the flexibilty / convenience / savings of bodyweight training though, but not by a huge margin. I can’t target specific areas as easily and sometimes it’s a bit tricky to jump from one exercise to a harder one, certainly harder than just adding weight to a bar. Overall though it’s a good fit if you’re anti-social and frugal.

Incline Dumbbell Press - Warmup followed by 3 working sets at 10-8-6 reps respectively.

Incline Dumbbell Fly - 3 x 12 (sometimes supersetted with Incline Dumbbell Press)

Cable Crossover - 2 x 12 for Upper and Lower chest each (4 sets total)

**Day 4 Arms (Just started doing this 2 weeks ago)**:

My arms day consists of every tricep exercise from day 1 combined with every bicep exercise from day 2.  I may substitute an exercise or two if im getting bored like switching skullcrushers to overhead tricep extensions or dumbbell curl to preacher curl.

**Summary**:  Trial and error has gotten me to where I am now.  I was consistent for the first 3 months that I was lifting but with an awful split (literally just a chest/triceps day and a back/biceps day) and going 3-4 times a week.  Then I took a two month break where I didn't have a gym available because I was home from college for winter break/was stupid and didn't lift for the first month back at school after break.  Kept that pretty awful split going until April where I finally started doing legs! Didn't start doing shoulders until this summer and it shows.  Then I just threw an arms day in there because I figured why not.

If you have any questions feel free to pm me or comment.  And if I missed anything please point it out.  Diet is in a comment but I can copy into the post if thats an issue.

* 1. Lifting like a savage beast and beating PRs.
* 2. Eating 250kcal-500kcal more than you are expending.

Many people over-complicate both. The following is how to get big and strong

* **1. Lift Heavy and Hard... (and stretch!).**

* Aim for 5 sets of 5 reps on each exercise. For now.

* Deadlift
* Squat
* Bench
* Rows
* Pull-Ups
* Mobility drills

Beat your PRs every workout. Aim to lift 5lbs more than last time. If you can't, take an extra rest and try that rep one more time until you do.

* **2. Eat Muscle Food.**

* Eat the foods below so you are eating 250kcal-500kcal over your *maintenance*.
* Maintenance = BMR + Energy Expended Daily + Energy Expended in Exercise.
* 
* 
* Example: 150lbs BW, sedentary/little activity.
* Maintenance = 1725kcal (BMR) + 300kcal (Avg. daily energy) + 400kcal (60min Strength Training).
* **To Gain** = 2775-2925kcal (2425kcal Maintenance + 250-500kcal).

Instead of trying to put this all in a neat paragraph I am just going to list it.  These first few ones were probably the most helpful to me personally:

* Stop smoking (appetite suppressant)
* Stop drinking coffee (appetite suppressant)
* Substitute water or whole milk for all beverages
* Meal replacement bars eaten before breakfast (This was a big one
* Nuts : almonds, healthy, not too filling; I honestly keep a bag in my pocket to munch on at all times; If you don't like nuts try adding chocolate)
* Dark chocolate with almonds (LOL since I don't like almonds)
* Peanutbutter on everything
* Cook everything with Coconut Oil
* Added heavy whipping cream to my gainer shake
* Added pasteurized raw eggs 
* Oatmeal (sparingly
* Rice (sparingly
* Cheese
* Traditional greek yogurt (none of that 0% fat crap)

**NOTE** I have celiac disease so gluten is a no-go for me (in case you were wondering why there were no breads or pasta on this list; I probably wouldn't have included them anyways since they can be too filling)

I just try and eat constantly without over-eating

Age: 19-22

Routine: I lift 3x a week and run anywhere between 0-2 times a week depending on the nature of my weight gain. My gains are slow but clean and I very rarely have to cut weight. It took me about a year to get into a routine to where I was making consistent progress but I did notice a considerable increase in mass after I ditched machines. I don't have an exclusive ""leg day"" which may be a major point of criticism in my schedule--rather I favor staying at the gym longer to work more parts than coming in more frequently and narrowing my focus. I may consider changing my regime up to accomodate that. 

Diet: I plan on eating ~2500 calories a day but sometimes this stretches to 3000 if I feel I *really* worked hard. I'm a fan of the Pure protein bars and the Cliff bars (each have ~20g protein). These are almost always my breakfast and mid-afternoon snack. Most of my protein comes from chicken

Stats in lbs: (I don't consider 1 rep max

I've been lurking on here for a month or so now and I really enjoy seeing other peoples progress shots so I thought it was probably time to contribute. I'll try to be as thorough as I can

I've always been tall and skinny

I flew out to Australia in October 2011 for one year and started working as a labourer on a building site

Heres a couple of shots of me - http://imgur.com/a/ON1rJ#FExHzDI

The first is July 2012

At the end of my Australia trip (October 2012) I just thought fuck this I'm going to give it a go. I flew home to the UK

I had actually stopped drinking/smoking as well so I felt pretty motivated.

My routine consisted of:

**Chest and Triceps**  

* 3x10 Dumbbell Bench Press
* 3x10 Incline Dumbbell Bench Press
* 3x10 Dumbbell Flys 
* 3x10 Assisted Tricep Dips
* 3x10 Tricep Cable Pull Down

**Back and Biceps** 

* 3x10 Assisted Wide Grip Pull Up
* 3x10 Seated Dumbbell Bicep Curls
* 3 sets of 21's (bicep curls) on the EZ bar
* 3x10 Concentration Curls
* 3x10 Wide Grip Lat Pulldown
* 3x10 Close Grip Pulldowns

**Thursday - Shoulders**

* 3x10 Shoulder Press with Dumbbells
* 3x10 Lateral Raises with Dumbbells
* 3x10 Front Raises with Dumbbells 
* 3x10 Shrugs with Plates in hand or Olympic bar

I did that for the first month  - here are the pics of me two weeks in (quality isn't so great.)

In terms of strength

My legs still feel pretty weak, but I'm hoping to see gains soon!!

The one change I've made recently is to drop down from 10 reps to 8 on most exercises

The struggle to satisfy your calorie needs will get a lot easier with these.

.

**required time:** 25 min

**required skills:** a degree in rocket science

**required utensils:** a bowl

.
___________________________________________________________

.

**For the basic substance You need**

* 200 grams (2 cup) of **oats**
* 200 grams (1^1/2 to 2 cup) of **protein powder** of your choice
* 250 to 300 grams (1 to 1^1/2 cups) of **peanut butter**^1
* some **milk**
* about 3 spoons of **honey** (or more if you like it sweet)
* ground **nuts or flax**
* for the taste: whatever you like

.

^1) you can also use peanut mousse which is entirely out of peanuts

.
___________________________________________________________

.

Now here's how you do it: the steps are **very difficult**

 So if you feel up to it

.


**how they're made:**


.

**1)** throw everything in a bowl

**2)** Mix it with your hands until its a sticky mass

**3)** done 

(no baking required!)

.


If you made it this far

.


**4)** Put the mass on a baking paper as seen in [this picture](http://imgur.com/m6kku0B&amp;muHbRBt) and form a nice long block. (it's the finished product put you get the idea... i hope)

**4.1)** Put the nuts or flax on it

**5)** put it in the refrigerator until its hard (30 min)

.

.

___________________________________________________________

They contain A LOT of **calories

You can experiment with the flavor by adding different stuff.

.

One of these bars should be enough for **a week** and you can store it for like.. 10 days if it's cooled.

.

.

If you use cups you will get a bit less

.

I hope you enjoy it

.

.

**TL;DR:** if you're to lazy to read this you better buy meal replacement bars at a store.

I'm here to say that if you WANT it
It may not be the most drastic change EVER, going from 1,200 cals a day to 3,700 - 4,000 cals a day. I started eating until I puked, and then started eating more &amp; more. I lifted until I couldn't take anymore, and had to sit on the floor in a corner of the gym for a half hour

I am 5foot10 for reference.  
  
A little bit of back story; I've been very underweight for most of my teen life and got incredibly fed up of it in my first year at university. Found gainit before coming back for second year and swore to join the gym and eat more than I ever had before.   
So [this was me](http://imgur.com/a/8zDI7) at 53kg/116lbs.   

I had a 26 inch waist with hips and ribs that stuck out like a corpses.
  
  
Since that day I have been going to the gym three times a week and eating around 3000-3500 calories a day.
This has caused me to put on 6kg/13lbs in about 2 months. [ME NOW](http://imgur.com/a/uJUZ7) at 59.55kg/131lbs with a 30 inch waist.

**Day A**  
Deadlift 5x5   
Pullups/Chinups  
Military press 5x5  
Squat 4x8

Deadlift 5x5  
Barbell rows 5x5  
Bench press 5x5  
Squat 4x8

**Military Press**  
35kg/77lbs - 45kg/99lbs  
**Barbell rows**   
45kg/99lbs - 60kg/143lbs  
**Bench Press**  
 45kg/99lbs - 62.5kg/143lbs  
**Squat**   
55kg/121lbs - 80kg/176lbs  

**My diet on an average day**  
Breakfast - 4 large scrambled eggs on 4 slices of wholemeal bread  
Lunch - A few thickly spread peanut butter sandwiches  
Dinner - Large portion of Chicken
Each meal is accompanied with a pint of full fat milk and I will drink another if I feel hungry throughout the day    
Snacks - Fruit, I try to keep it healthy(ish).  

**EDIT: Found some pictures from week 3 and 5
And based on what has been said I've reduced deadlifting to once a week but may increase it to twice a week if gains slow in either bodyweight or the 2.5kg weekly add-on progression.

I do hypertrophy based training and do not go below 6 reps on my sets as it worked best for me. I personally never tried SS

Squats: 225 for 7-8 reps(going parallel)  
Deadlifts: ~200lbs for 6 reps  

**Nutrition**: Most important factor which helped me grow was my 3.5-4k Calories Diet. I'm a vegetarian but I started eating eggs to get some extra protein. A lot of my calories while bulking came Protein shake containing 2 scoops of Whey Protein, 1Tbsp PB, ~600ml Milk.

[Progress pic](http://imgur.com/i302q)

The first picture is actually more than six months ago but I was at that point six months before the ""after"" photo.
I went from 135 pounds to 160 pounds in weight. I increased my bench press by 85 pounds. I went from doing 5 pull ups to 10 with a +35 pound belt. My row increased significantly although I don't know how much. For lower body I mostly do machine hack squats (unfortunately) do to an old injury in highschool that required surgery so I mainly focus on higher reps with lower body. As for core I can now do 25 decline situps while holding 50 pounds at my head.

**I had tried working out before but it never really worked, it has blown my mind.**

Here is what I did.

-High weights low reps. Sometimes pyrimids. If I ever did more than 10 reps I increased the weight.

-Pre-workout: N O Explode

-Post workout: Gold Standard Whey from Optimum Nutrition

-Worked out only 3 times a week (full body)

-Inspiration from Fitit/Gainit

-Fitocracy.com

Upperbody: Pullups, shoulder press, rows

Lowerbody: Machine hack squat

Hey guys! figured I would do a post here since I just recently become serious about lifting. I started January 1st of this year and did Shortcut to Size (google

Before I started lifting I had fuckarounditis for a majority of the time in the gym. (been in and out of the gym since freshman year of highschool

http://imgur.com/a/MoxE3

The first picture is freshman year of HS without EVER lifting before. Than the following two is a bit of lifting (still pre-jan 1st). And the last three are current. I tried to get a lat picture on the last pic but was a bit awkward without someone taking it for me. Sorry about no legs

I followed a pretty intense bulk for the first month of 4000 calories and saw myself basically explode with weight. Then it slowed down

I eat pb&amp;j in the morning. then a cliff builders bar 2-3 hours later. Then I get a full italian combo at panera bread (work there full time) with baguette side. Then another bar before workout. Then post workout I eat the rest of the sandwich. And for dinner I eat 1/2 lb of whole grain/wheat spaghetti with tomato sauce. And Ill throw in random junk food through-out the day. I.E I was eating a bowl of ice cream before bed for a while to help with calories. And this last 2 weeks I drank about a 1/2 gal of whole milk a day to go from 160-167.

Hope I didn't leave out any other info haha sorry for wall of text.

I started training exactly one year ago almost day for day! I lifted on the Joe Defranco skinny bastards program and combined with decent food packed on a solid amount of weight. The true game changed though was switching to barbells and eating like a madman and this is what its about. Lift heavy and eat heavy. You should be competing in the gym but

**#1 if you dont own tupperware

**#2 Rice cookers are bliss**: Another huge game changed for me was buying one of those 10$ rice cookers. Nothing has been able to give me so many complex carbs like brown rice has. I can easily eat a 100 grams dry which is about 350-375 calories prepared. I make it with rice

**#3 Ziplock your portions**: When I go shopping for food, pasta and rice into ziplock bags. Why bother? Because a meal is a 5 minutes ordeal once I have everything measured up in ziplock bags and ready to go. Not to mention it defrosts super quick also. I do this with everything! Call it OCD but being able to mindlessly put together a meal will be the difference between you eating 3K call 7 days a week and doing it only 3-4 days a week. 

**#4 When in doubt stuff it down your mouth**: I hear so much talk about macros and other crap. The honnest truth is this; does it really matter for the average skinny guy? No I mean seriously as long as you arent a moron eating a bag of chips then having that mccain deep and delicious right after and thinking wow I got my cal on there just shut up and eat it. Good/complex carbs + meats + fish there is no other secret!

**#5 Use a spoon and use it fast**: Call it mental but damn its so much easier to eat with a damn spoon if you want fill your face as hard and as fast as you can. Why do I say as fast as you can? This is a timing game! The quick you chew and pound the food down

**#6 use supplements as rewards not a base**: I never ever allowed myself to relly on supplements to make up calories or help me perform better. I saw these as a reward, reach their ""bro plateau"" and give up. For me it was the opposite, end of reward cycle I could always look forward to the next one. I honnestly cant wait to get on Creatine when I hit 145 and hit my ultimate goal of 155.

I think thats a few of the basic things to know. This is info that most people learn going in by no means is your one stop guide. I could sit here and write all about what foods to eat

After completing GOMAD, I made sure I drank a gallon of water a day, started drinking a protein shake a day (Optimum Nutrition was the best value for $$) and counting calories/protein daily.  Through my sophomore year of school I kept making sure I was hitting 2600 calories a day through any means necessary, around 150 grams of protein, pushing myself every workout and getting some cardio work through pickup basketball.

Summer came around again (2012) and I went through GOMAD once more, I was hit with an opportunity to become a co-ed cheerleader at my university and get access to the varsity gym + strength coaches.  This changed my workout style, focusing WAY more on squats, OHP, and overall base + core strength.  I was a cheerleader for a semester, then went back to PHAT and continuing my calories/protein.  When I started dating at the end of fall semester, being the 400m track runner at my school, eating a lot healthier and cutting back some of my gainz.  I did not lose any strength, myself

To anyone struggling to gain weight

EDIT: A typical diet day for me would go something like this (note: I'm living on a campus so I have to live with whatever the dining hall provides me and some outside foods):

With all meals I have 2-3 glasses of water and 1 glass of whole milk
Breakfast: 2 large bowls of oatmeal and assorted fruit/yogurt smoothie (1 glass)
Lunch: Varies according to whatever is being served, just straight spinach and carrots. 
Dinner: Same situation as lunch, mashed potatoes, pulled pork) along with another assorted fruit/yogurt smoothie.(1 glass)

The only reason I'm writing this is because I see posts every day about people who are struggling to eat even 2500kcal a day. To those people i offer my story.

I always loved being active ever since i was young. I would always be the most athletic of my peers and I was very competitive and loved racing other kids ever since i found out how good i was/am at sprinting. I was pretty much the fit kid in the grade.


One day my parents told me we were moving to a Brazil and thats when it pretty much went downhill. Now you might not know this but Brazilian cuisine is delicious so i was well fed, fortunately, had not gainied any weight. 

When we moved back to the States this weakened body of mine didn't really need need to consume large amounts of food in order to function. Yes, was appetite. I could easily function with 1500-2000kcal a day. I hovered at around 120lbs at 5'9 for a good 2 years.

Then came the summer after my freshman year when i decided i was going to put on weight. I signed up for a membership at my local YMCA and lifted and did whatever exercises were available and actually did quite good for myself gaining 10lbs. I was still eating quite terribly

The moment that i think changed my life was when one of my friends wanted to workout with me. It just gave me the motivation not to pussy out. I started lifting 3x/week and forced myself to eat. At first i resorted to a 1100kcal shake that i drank with my meals but even then i would often skip lunch or dinner as i wasn't hungry enough to eat. I was averaging about 2000kcal a day. Then i learned about r/gainitmeals and i made myself the monster breakfast. I left out the 4 pieces of toast and omitted one egg and even then I was barely able to eat it. I forced myself to eat 3 MEALS (not snacks) a day even if they weren't large portions. I even had to cut my shake because i wasn't going to sacrfice a meal for a shake. Within a month of stretching and abusing my stomach i could eat 3000kcal a day with some effort. Within the next month i was making monster lunches and dinners barely eeking them out

I promise you people who are just starting out that you can do it. If i can do it

EDIT: Thanks guys!
For my diet, or fried chicken. Once a week I would get a baked potato with a chopped beef sandwich. I wouldn't ever be able to eat all of my food, so I would save some protein and carbs for a little preworkout meal. I drank creatine and Karbolyn preworkout. I drink Universal Torrent for a postworkout shake(High quality protein, contains carbs, amino acids, and creatine). My mom would always have some kind of home cooked meal for dinner. Some kind of meat, with a couple sides. Then I would make my nightly shake before bed which is 2 scoops of Universal Real gains(1/2 a serving. Also, half a cup of blended oats, sorry!

Here lately I haven't been making gains so I decided to try [this diet that another Redditor posted on here. ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNctsEFp7Zs) Seems like a pretty solid diet for cheap. I started it yesterday.

For my workout plan I do a four day split. Chest and tris, and then shoulders combined with another muscle group that was lacking. For awhile there I was doing chest and legs twice a week just because I love the gym. I'm usually in there 2-3 hours but that's too long so I decided to cut it back a little bit. I also do core training every other day. As far as weight goes, I just push my self as hard as I possibly can while maintaining form. For some numbers, my squat started at repping 135 with difficulty. My 3RM is now 315. Bench I started pressing 35 or 40lb dumbbells, now I rep 85s for my last set. I can get more in depth with this if you guys would like but I'm at work right now.

**Intro:** I have been watching my figure since junior year of high school. Back then, I'd be at my goal.

ALSO

**Around 155 lb:**
[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/QxN2m.jpg)

Fast forward to Freshmen year of college, away from parents. I ended up going up to about 180 due to nothing but 7-11, sugary drinks, and ice cream/pizza in bulk quantities. Furthermore, these late nights took a toll on my freshmen year GPA (1.1 cumulative for the first year). At this point, I got really concerned and started working out a lot. 1 hr of balls to the walls cardio (Elliptical, Track

[Me at 180](http://i.imgur.com/kGxQ4.jpg)

When I was gaining and losing weight at this point, I would have an urgency to use the bathroom but would not be able to. Enter laxatives.

As I'm typing this, and seeing what vitamins they provided. I wanted to achieve maximum vitamins at the minimal cost of calories.

Summer 2008 I traveled to a ranch in Mexico. I couldn't count the calories in food

[At slightly above 135](http://imgur.com/5mD4j)

Since that belly of adipose tissue was still in place

2008-2009
Sophomore year since I no longer had the meal plan at school, a serving size of bran cereal (to ensure that my fiber was at 100% recommended daily value), and then just nibbled on whatever. I took a multivitamin to ensure that I was getting nutrients. I tried to run 3 miles one day. I sprinted a good quarter mile towards the end, when I suddenly blacked out. Although I was sure I was healthy, I stopped working out as a result. At nights, I would wake up because I felt my bones hurt or my legs and feet would cramp up. I had several problems at home (relatives dying, my best friend changing and me not being able to relate to him anymore).

[Before I knew it


I was constantly cold and moody. I went through a lot of stress due to my bad grades, and depressed. Now that I was able to see what I thought was a six pack, I decided to put on some weight. Luckily, a friend of mine was a huge weight lifter, so he gave me a simple routine. I still have my starting stats (which include the barbell/dumbbell weight)

Me @ 110 lb
Barbell Squat -- 100 lb
Barbell Bench -- 65 lb
Barbell Deadlift -- 80 lb
Overhead press -- 15 lb dumbbells
Pull-ups - 1
Curls - 20lb dumbbell
Dips - 5
Misc Abs

I started to eat more protein at this point -- took protein shakes and egg-white omelets. I figured that if I'm going to gain weight, and cut. This went on for a good 3 years. When I would see a hipster that was skinny fat, I wanted to get skinnier than them but be able to say that I'm strong than them.

I noticed that my attitude started taking a toll on my relationships with people. People would pull away or just want to hangout with me less. I was no longer attractive to girls

My lifts around 120 lb were as follows:

Barbell Bench (quarter way) - 175lb
Quarter BB Squats - 185 lb
Rounded Back Deadlifts - 185lb
Military/Overhead press - 50 lb barbell
Pullups - 5
Curls/Tricept Extensions - 20lb

Around 2010, I did alright without them. I'd have my bad days like everyone else but I had my good days as well. Furthermore, I was embarrassed to take them and didn't want a lifelong dependency on them.

During my last month in college

&gt;&gt; 2012

Now that I'm done with college

[Yesterday -- September 08](http://i.imgur.com/Q8l5b.png)

(dat lighting)

I've decided to continue my eating habits of having everything as least processed as possible

I'm currently at around 135 lb

I started working out with my younger brother since he's overweight. We swap out gear between exercises (I deadlift

My current stats:

215 lb Squats (slightly below parallel)
205 lb Deadlifts (I need more weight and possibly gloves)
145 lb Benching (hits the chest)
Sets of 8 Pull/Chin ups (hands either way)
95 lb Bent over Rows
85 lb Standing Military Press
35 lb Dumbbell Lunges
35 lb Curls/Tricept Extensions
~8:30 minute miles (about 2+ every other day)

I know that I'm still at 135, I'm not quite sure where to go from there.

Sorry for the long read

27 years old male, than played soccer and basketball for about 6 years, after that I stopped to focus on my studies. Became skinnier and skinnier, always wanted to have a 6-pack without working out too much, so I just ate around 2000 kcals and did nothing all day.

Last year I started working out to overcome my mild depression

I started with a split routine suggested by the personal trainer at my gym

Right now I'm focusing on compound lifts (Deadlifts, dips, OHP), can't squat for shit since I found out recently I have anterior peltic tilt, I wondered why whenever I tried squatting I fell backward before even reaching parallel, so I just did it on the Smith Machine...my hamstrings are the weakest part of my body, I'm doing lots of stretching to correct my bad posture.

This is what I look like right now. Up until recently, with less body fat, and I’m only an inch or two taller. The way I look isn’t nearly as important to me as the books I read, the music I play, or the conversations I have, but it has it’s place. I look the way I’d like to look. I’ll always push myself to lift more weight, to get leaner, but I’m happy to see how far I’ve come. I’ve seen my physical discipline translate into mental toughness that helps me immeasurably in academic endeavors.

Grew up poor, and I grow up as a skinny food-paranoid twerp. It wasn't so bad, though; I was at least at a decent 90-95 pounds a few years ago.


The problem that occurred was this. I had to be placed on focus medication for my ADD, and I lost ten pounds in a few short months. They took me off the medication overnight, and told me I needed to regain weight before I can even think of going back on them.


This was some two or three years ago


Now then. I've been attempting on and off to regain weight, and I can go back to being able to think rationally and intelligently again. If it turns out that adding exercise and the likes will also fix my attention and memory issues without medication, well, bonus to that!


As things currently are, look healthy, feel healthy, and be able to THINK for once.


Thus far


As for food, I tend to always go for fruits, vegetables, or 'lean' foods that don't do much to give me actual weight. The thought of eating grease-heavy foods makes me cringe, and I don't know what triggers my IBS yet. Each meal is a bit of a guessing game.


I'm considering signing up for some sort of exercise course

I try to hit each muscle group minimum 2 times a week and maximum 4 times a week depending on what I'm doing. I know reddit hates the long workouts but personally I have no problem with them as long as you front load your workout with strength training and make sure to eat at least 2 meals/ protein before beginning a lift.

Day 1: Chest[bench, fly, pushups], Tricep, Abs

Day 2: Back, boxing (~20min)

Day 3: Shoulder, swimming (~20-30min)

Chest was something that was hard for me to grow for a while. I always had 'decent' form (no arching the back

So I've never really bothered to worry about my squat form because I've watched countless videos and done tons of research and shit. That being said

As I was mentally preparing to move up to a 190 pound set of squats for the first time (i do this by glaring at myself in the mirror and clenching/unclenching my sphincter) there were some fellow gym dudes around me doing various exercises. People at my gym don't squat. There is only one BB rack for squats and barely ANYONE ever uses it. I found this fucking weird because from what I had been researching on r/gainit, but reassurance came to me from within..my pants. 

Weights on, bar up, feet out to the shoulders, drop it RIP. I felt my shorts rip and was fucking horrified. Sitting, er, squatting there with the heaviest weight I've ever lifted in the toughest position of the lift and all I could think about was the indecent exposure of my hairy asshole to my fellow gym buds. This visualization (of my asshole) combined with embarrassment made me start to crack up, which is fucking bad news when you're below parallel with the bar on your back. Luckily I pulled it together and reracked to check my asscrack. Luckily

Felt pretty good after that. This was the first time my boxers had ripped

I can't really win any weight. My goal was to do the weight gain increasing muscle and maintaining BMI (10%ish). Is that aiming too far?
Should I win fat &amp; muscle and then burn the fat?

2. Divide into golf ball sized portions and roll into balls between wet palms. Roll into coconut and store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Freeze em  to make that shit firm.

10 december 2012 http://i.imgur.com/wIGCOEu.jpg This is a few months after the army at about 87 kg (192lbs) I was almost 200lbs at june

Then in this 6 months I made a cutting diet

15 june 2013 (today) http://i.imgur.com/K0VfFCJ.jpg at 77kg (170lbs)

It may seem a little strange to you but between the last and the second last pic are really 10kg difference. There you see that fat is fucking heavy.
I think everyone agrees with me that the pre-2012 pictures are not interesting. The biggest step I made between winter 2012/2013 and summer 2013. My workout routine

Mo Chest/Tri 5 sets a 8 reps a about 80% max weight for each (10 sets all together) + 30 min abs

Tuesday Legs (Squats

Wednesday Biceps/Upper Back also 5 sets a 8 reps a 80% max weight for each (10 sets all together) + 30min abs

Thursday Shoulders+Abs/Back 5 sets a 8 reps a 80% max weight for shoulders and Abs/Back until I was totally exhausted 

Friday Break

Saturday Legs (The same as above) sometimes I was busy on weekends and had no time for workouts

After every workout I made 45 minutes cardio (running

Every workout took about 1.5h + 45 min cardio. It was pretty hard doing that for 4 months (februar-may) 4-5 times a week but I think it paid off.

Food: I made a low carb diet, veggies and fruits, reduced amount of alcohol massively.

Supplements: I took a Weigh Isolate (from Olimp) for the last 2-3 months and a Extra Burner from Body Attack (for Cardio). I drank a shake in the morning and one immediately after workout

EDIT: What I totally forgot to say: I'm trying to keep weight until my exams are over (august) and I want to do a bulking phase between september-december 2013 - my goal is to go up at 87kg [190lbs]) I would appreciate any kind of tips about that!

When choosing a charter member

Xolace has had a long road to his gains, and fast. He restricted his caloric intake to as low as 800, and even as low as 500 on rare occasions. As he proceeded to drastically drop weight, his girlfriend and others complimented him on his progressively thinner physique, and this lit the fire in his belly to work even harder. 

Xolace quickly reached a point where weight loss was no longer advisable for maintaining proper health, he was now crippled by a fear of fat gain. 

He was now jogging 10 minutes before every meal, and culminated in him losing consciousness while weighing himself. 

Now a year deep in a severe case of anorexia,000 calories daily while forcing him to remain sedentary. The weight came on fast, with some well-needed water weight and fat filling out his small frame. At first, it was difficult, but difficulty soon turned into drive and motivation to gain and eat more. He peaked ~130 lbs., but proceeded to lose another 10 lbs. 

At this point, and was overwhelmed with the amazing feedback. He began studying fitness and health, and is now gaining at a nice pace of 1 lb. a month while increasing his strength. In his own words, *""I feel 10 times more healthier, 10000 times more stronger and 10000000000000000000 times more confident around females and even males since I've hit the 130 range. Every day is still a struggle and challenging, but it's getting easier as I keep growing, mentally and physically.""*

You're surely right about that. The beginning of your story is a somber reminder of how serious an eating disorder can turn someone's life upside down. That makes it all the more impressive that you've grown so much in strength, Xolace, and welcome to the Hall of Gains.**

**Background** 

I started going to the gym with the intention of gaining muscle mass in mid 2010 and getting a beach body with in a few months

This lack of putting on weight even thou I was eating well

After returning to uni, but this got to a point where would literally fall asleep if I sat down for more than a minute, it was highly embarrassing, this was my second blessing in disguise. I soon went to the doctor and explained my symptoms, to which after a short period of time, multiple tests and surgery, I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma (cancer of the lymphnodes). [This](http://i.imgur.com/r9bGTSd.jpg) is me just before I started 6 months of rigorous chemo.

My chemo worked out that I had 4 rounds every 2 weeks, any day I could with a pretty good split that I have modified a lot but the basics I learnt in this period are still the basis of most of my current plans.
After 4 months of chemo I was still going gym but one day (remember it like it was yesterday) I was on the smith machine doing chest press, I finished my second set, stuck to my rest period, then dug in for my third set, hit 3 reps and felt a flush of illness come over me, a feeling I had come very accustom to, I was going to be sick. I ran as fast as I could to the toilet but didn't make it in time and threw up in the hall way of the gym, I was highly embarrassed and disappointed

I didn't train for 3 months

At the end of my chemo (September 2012) and after the training that I could manage [this](http://i.imgur.com/Z3CoBOk.jpg) is what I looked like.

As you can see I look a lot better and I haven't trained in that picture for 3 months, especially compared to my house mates, and my confidence was remarkably low, so.. BACK TO THE GYM.

I started training pretty much every day using plans that I had read about online and combining them together to make my own, that was my life for 5 months. I ended up looking like [so](http://i.imgur.com/YY4hdp7.jpg).

I really enjoyed my training but I knew that my techniques were rubbish and that I really didn't no it all, exercises and techniques. After 3 months of training whilst I was doing all my qualifications, I gained around 20kgs (a lot of that was fat) but I was very impressed with the skills I had learnt and how well I had improved and how much I had gained. This is what my [front](http://i.imgur.com/PpTYBXO.jpg) and [back](http://i.imgur.com/jaadmat.jpg) looked like, as you can see I gained quite a bit.

Next I started a cut down as I was fairly happy with my results, but also lost a lot of muscle mass. Unfortunately my medical history meant I inevitably ended up in injury which meant I couldn't finish my cut down, a massive throw back in my confidence as I really thought my medical problems were over. Due to overtraining and not sticking to my own rules I damaged the medial collateral ligament in my knee and the ACL in my knee. This meant I had to wear a knee brace to stop my leg from bending, to allow the tendons to recover. I stuck to my diet and did as much upper body as I could and the final result of the cut down got me to this [state](http://i.imgur.com/zCVMRkm.jpg) which I was very proud of. I am on the left, with my brace nicely decorated by a fellow festival goer!

At this point (July 2012) I started my job as a self employed personal trainer

**January 2013**

I started my current ‘bulk’ and due to my now very large expertise and knowledge I have gathered over just under a year Im pleased to say its going very well. To keep on track I measure myself on a weekly basis and take photos

**The Plan**
Everything is in kg’s and the weight is the amount of weight on either side of the bar.

* Monday- [Chest + Tri’s](http://i.imgur.com/MqWgibE.png)
* Tuesday- [Back + Bi’s](http://i.imgur.com/p2eezAv.png)
* Wednesday- [Core](http://i.imgur.com/564a006.jpg)
* Thursday- [Legs](http://i.imgur.com/GviOQ4y.png)
* Friday- [Shoulders](http://i.imgur.com/j9Gai8r.png)
* Saturday (Every other week)- [Barbell Compound](http://i.imgur.com/uhYDPVu.png)

**Diet**
I have stuck to a very simple and VERY clean routine
[This is my diary for each day](http://i.imgur.com/XPlOXEy.png).
*On a side note i will only have casein protien on days i go really hard, i dont take it every day*.

Frustratingly last week I had to have surgery on my feet due to side affects from the chemo so my leg training has had to take a small break until the surgery heals

Im not where I want to be yet, its my drive for every day.

This post is kinda for myself just to remind myself of everything I have achieved as well as hopefully some people will see it and feel motivated by it

Everyone on this thread says ""you're not special, some of us have to be special. There have to be some outliers who would find it much more difficult to put on weight even if all other factors were exactly the same (diet, sleep, workout, intensity, etc.)

I obviously have a personal bias talking about this subject - I've never met anyone (girl or boy) with thinner wrists/ankles than myself. I have normal/smallish hands

I think there will be other users who can do the same, I have noticed no change in bone structure at all. Any thoughts people?

EDIT: I should have left the term hardgainer out of the title - it always creates a shitstorm of conflicting opinions. I'll leave the original post up above

How significant of a limiting factor is bone structure with regards to the absolute genetic-limit of someone's mass-gaining potential? Does anyone have any examples of progress posts/videos of lifters with abnormally thin bone structure successfully putting on a large amount of mass (so that I know what I can realistically achieve myself)?

Hello Gainit.
A year ago I decided enough was enough and I was going to bulk


**Beginning**
So

How little did I know. haha. Anyway

My bench press was two 17lb bells for three sets of ten.
This was me.  [http://i.imgur.com/0QvqOaP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0QvqOaP.jpg)

**Middle**
I started doing a bit of reading on bulking up and routines. I tried my hand at SS and SL but I just kept getting ahead of myself which lead to lots of small injuries left right and centre. Over the next few months I kept going to the gym consistently

Here was me in June: http://i.imgur.com/ErC89P1.jpg

**Present**

For the sake of keeping fit I took up Karate

**1RM: Deadlift: 258lbs - Squat: 219lbs -  Bench: 176lbs**


 My numbers aren't the greatest but I've come along way in 10 months of lifting I think given I've kept no real set routine and I started off being less than the weight of an empty bar. 
Here is a shot of me at 72Kg [http://i.imgur.com/OpVlaiw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OpVlaiw.jpg)


Edit: With legs.  [http://i.imgur.com/EUjkl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EUjkl.jpg)


**Diet:**
I hate to admit it, maybe got through about 750g (tub and a half) over the course of the year.


**Onwards**

I hope to dial in a decent routine over the course of this year and My goal is to hit the 1000lb club at somepoint in the next year and a half. I believe it's doable

Anyway


**TL;DR: Sloppy routine and diet held back both weight and lift gains

I'm fairly new to this subreddit
I started at 15, and it took its toll on my confidence. Now, after putting on 20 pounds (I'm Australian, so that's 9kg for my Australian friends) I feel as confident as ever. It's helped my mental health, physical health, and appearance. I've been going with my dad, and we are now somewhat similar in terms of strength. 

I began at 67kg (147 pounds. Note this weight is a rough estimate as I did not weight myself when I first began lifting) and am now 76kg (167 pounds) and am 6 foot tall. 

I began simply going 3 times a week, upper body. I'd start off and head to the bench every single day I went. Soon enough I gained a small amount of strength and hit a plateau, which is when I did my research and began a 5 day split, chest, arms &amp; abs, shoulders, legs

My diet has been lacking but recently I've simply been eating 6 meals a day and have put on about 1kg. Breaking past the 75kg mark was a challenge for me and was very rewarding when I finally did (and was the incentive for this post). Even though I know I'm nowhere near as built as some of you guys are

Last winter started seriously researching diet and exercise and stumbled across this subreddit. It helped me a TON! I started doing StrongLifts 5x5 and about a month ago switched to StrongLifts 3x5.

In August I was out of the gym for almost a month and a half due to severe bronchitis. Upon returning

Squat 75 --&gt; 185

But when I bend over it looks really fear. I have the skinnyfat gene and I have it bad. I'm really starting to get worried. 

I am planning to keep gaining till March (hopefully hit 180) and then cut for summer. Rinse and repeat for 1 more year after summer ends (gain to ~190 and cut to ~180). I DON'T WANT TO BE HUGE. In my mind

This is when i started to take legs seriously. I was not fond of legs but i soon realized that i needed to sculp my whole body. I do not seem much difference in the ~170-~182. I believe a gained a fair amount in my legs but mostly my stomach.

Im not to sure why all my pictures make me look lopsided but whatever. I know I have a long way to go but i though it would share with all of you my progress. Here is how i have gotten here so far.

Months ago i was on my own scedual. Whatever i fel like i needed to work out then that is what i did. I changed that knowing that i actually need to do a pre made regime. I have been doing the [shortcut o size program](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/shortcut-to-size.html) recently and i am on my way to finishing it.

Off the top of my head i normally do 3 sets of 10 depending on the workout:
Bench: 95-115-160
Squat: 115-185
Deadlift (4 sets of 4):135-275

My meals would vary from week to week. Normally it would be:
Breakfast- 5 eggs w/ salsa, granola bar, protein shake.

Lunch- Anything i made in my crock pot. Usually a big ass bowl of chilie or BBQ chicken. Glass of milk

Dinner- More crock pot or sandwich or hamburgers

I would also snake on anything throughout the whole day drinking a lot of water.

Im sure this wont be your cup of tea when it comes to getting pumped but it works for me:
Stars over Texas- Tracy Lawrence
If you're reading this- tim Mcraw
Letters from home-John Michael Montgomery
I'll make a man out of you- Mulan soundtrack
American soldier- tody keith

1363122187.0,1a662w,*As Requested* Cardio And Gaining,Gilbear3,50,10,18,"**Cardio And Gaining Weight**

Its a long standing view that cardio and lifting weights to put on muscle mass is a ‘no go’ however this is not true.

Its possible but must be done correctly.

The two most effective ways to burn fat and work cardio is via LSD (long slow duration) and HIIT (high intensity interval training). These two forms of training will reduce the chances of going catabolic (where you expend too much and start to break down muscle rather than build it)


**LSD**

LSD Training is very simple but MUST be done at the correct intensity and this is different for every single person. You have to work at 50-60% of your MHR (max heart rate). The best way to work this out is the karvonen method

Your max heart rate
Your resting heart rate

The method is simple:
((HRmax − HRrest) × % intensity) + HRrest

Im 21 so my max heart rate is  199BPM (220-21=199)
My resting heart rate is 56BPM

50%= (199-56)x0.5+56= 127.5 BPM
60%= (199-56)x0.6+56= 141.8 BPM

So for me to do LSD training my heart rate would have to be between 127-141BPM. This doesn't sound very high and thats because it isn't

The final thing to consider with LSD is when you decide to do this in your training schedule, you will have to wait 20 minutes (average male) before you start burning fat as you have to go though your energy stores before that fat will be utilized as energy.

I personally get on the treadmill stick it at 6.5kph and fast walk for 40 minutes at the end of my sessions as that hits my heart rate zone perfectly at 135 BPM. You will have seen people walking at a steep incline, as soon as you hold on to the treadmill you disengage those muscles and are wasting your time, so walk on flat!

**HIIT**

HIIT is something that has exploded into the fitness industry as of the last 2 years but has been around for years without people really paying attention.
If your brain is hurting [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1pGqkrkgr4) is a video I made a while back explaining HIIT.

HIIT works using your anaerobic energy system

The best form I feel for this is performing a 100m sprint (or 80m/60m dependent on the time it takes you) at full effort trying to get 12-13s time

HIIT MUST be performed as the last thing you do before you leave for home because of the way it works; something called EPOC (excessive post-exercise oxygen consumption). What this means is over the next hour or two you will breathe at a slightly higher rate, see the connection to LSD? This is the fat burning zone, so unlike LSD where you utilize your fat stores during the training, you are using them whilst doing jack all!

As well as being a remarkably efficient fat burner it is much more fun

For all of you that want to know whether you can go out for a 6 mile jog on a Sunday after your lunch

I hope this guide helps all of you

Good Luck!

**The story**:
I've ALWAYS been skinny and people would give me shit for it, but then my friend took me to the gym and I realized how much more working out I needed to be doing if I wanted to get anywhere. So I started going to the gym and taking mass gainer and eating a ton and over the past 6 months I have made awesome gains and I'm pretty happy with the results! I've gained about 35 pounds, but of course hitting puberty/growing helped too.

The pics don't really show much progress lately because I've been plateaued at around 170 for a little bit now. So I don't see much difference on the scale or the mirror

My current 5 rep maxes are:

Deadlift: 255

I know deadlifts and squats aren't suppose to be the same, the best I can do right now.

1366324233.0,1cmzcj,[Progress] 165 to 205lbs in 8 months,klawdi,44,12,88,"Hello fellow gainers

Before I start
Alright so

In my teenage years I used to be fat for several reasons (shitty upbringing, etc.) At my worst I think I was (5'11"" / 205lbs / 25% BF) or maybe even a litte heavier. Anyway, one day I woke up and I told myself I needed to lose weight and it became my obsession. For a whole year, I almost didn't eat anything and rode my stationary bike for 30min a day, at least 5 times a week. I was so determined to lose weight that I ended up losing way too much. I went from (5'11"" / 205lbs) to (6' / 165lbs). I'm not going to bother showing you pictures of me when I was fat because  I don't even have that many, I just hated taking pictures of myself back then.

When I lost all that weight, how stupid. 

Fast forward a couple months later, this man changed my life on so many levels. As I was scrolling through his page, mirin' every single picture of his, that's when it hit me. For once in my life I felt like I knew exactly what I had to do. I finally had a goal, a purpose in life. To get the most aesthetic physique that my genetics will allow me to get. I didn't care how hard I had to work or how long it would take me, I knew it would be worth it and I still have that same mentally to this day.

It's been 8 months since I've been going to the gym and I can safely say that I've never been happier in my life. Just thinking about my future progress makes me even happier (hornier too

So without further ado

After : http://imgur.com/a/alQAq#0

I eat about 3600 calories a day and I lift 5 times a week.

Thu : REST

I wanted to join the US Air Force

I was a longtime lurker of reddit and happened across /r/fitness one day. I heard of Starting Strength and had my doubts that it would work for me. After seeing multiple progress reports I decided I would buy the damn book and give it my all.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/dZzWf.jpg) is me before I was training. Sorry the photo is blurry

And [this](http://i.imgur.com/1YwRQ.jpg) is me today

**DIET**

I tried to keep my daily caloric consumption around 3500 calories a day, and as often as I could.

A typical breakfast for me would be 3 eggs, a banana, and a pint of whole milk.

I 'll usually try to get a snack of fiber(almost always vegetables like SteamFresh packs

For dinner I'll try to eat anything with plenty of protein and carbs and healthy fat. I try to keep dinner lenient while following these rules so I don't go crazy only eating healthy foods.

I take a multi-vitamin everyday. I took creatine for 2 months

**LIFTS**

* Squat from 95lbs to 205lbs 3x5

I've deloaded multiple times because of form issues with my low-bar back squat. The most recent time I had gotten to 225x3x5 when I realized I was letting my knees give in to abduction(caving in) on my ascent.

* Bench from 65lbs to 145lbs 3x5

I recently deloaded from 155lbs after some pain in my right shoulder that was from poor form. I was deltoid-dominant in my bench press until I read up some more on technique

* Overhead Press from 45lbs to 100lbs 3x5

I hated OHP until I buckled down on form and started doing it correctly. Now I fucking love it to death because it's given my narrow shoulder-frame actual

* Power Clean from 75lbs to 115lbs 5x3

My form sucks. I'm having a hard time utilizing my hips completely and I'm using a tad bit of arm strength to hoist  the bar up. I believe it's a mental block

* Deadlift from 95lbs to 265lbs 1x5

I like girls, huh?

**ACCESSORY EXERCISES**

* Chin-ups from 4 unweighted to 3x6 weighted+30lbs

My second favorite exercise. I do these Marine Corps style(arms completely extended between reps) with a dip belt attached. I alternate between these and pull-ups on different days. People stare at me when I do these. I don't know if they stare because my gym shirts have sweat stains in the pits and they're unsightly

* Pull-ups from 4 unweighted to 3x6 weighted+27.5lbs

Same situation as chin-ups

* Front Squat from 135lbs to 145lbs 3x5

I just started doing these a week or so ago. I have a hard time keeping my torso as vertical as need be and the weight of the bar rests a tad bit on my wrists when I'm in the hole.  I need to work on form. I'll make like old school Nickelodeon and figure it out.

* Calf raises(one leg at a time) 3x8 weighted+25lbs

I started doing these when I noticed my calves looked shrimpy.  IMO

I do one legged standing calf raises on a raised platform so I can achieve full ROM while holding a 25 lbs plate.  I also do the sitting machine with whatever the fuck amount of weight I use

* Dips from 3x10 to 3x5 weighted+10lbs

I recently incorporated dips on my OHP days to give my pecs something to do.

* Sit-ups

I use a sit-up station(?) at my gym that has a decline setting. I put it declined as far as it will go

* Barbell curls 72.5lbs 3x7

I do these when noone's looking.

**CURRENTLY**
I've decided not to join the Air Force because I've joined the Marine Corps instead: the recruiting station was closer to my house and I think their uniforms are neat. Jokes aside, and a darker side of me wants to see combat for some reason.

I plan on trying to gain around 5-10 more pounds of muscle before I leave for boot camp in December while running as often as I do now to keep my cardio and endurance up. I usually run around 1.5miles to 3 miles on my days off from Starting Strength

My confidence before I started training was almost nonexistent. Now

Training and working out has helped my mental health as much if not more than my physical health. My priorities are in order,,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,True

Also I'm looking for any tips on routine or specific muscles that need more help. 

Current routine is a 5 day split
Day 1-back 
Day 2-Shoulder/biceps
Day 3-chest

I'm here to ask a few questions about an idea I have. 


I'm thinking of doing a YouTube channel based off of the principal IIFYM (if it fits your macros) cooking.

 idea is to have:

Essentially, 40-80g fat and 300-400g carb. 


No bullshit like ""meals for gains""


Essentially:
Ideas for the show:
* macro breakdown for every meal

* Cheap! (student friendly)

* small stomach meals: medium/high calorie meals which do not take a lot stomach space. Avoiding drinking calories (no gomad/2DEAD)

* high carb

* high protein

* 3000 calories meal plan - workout day

* 2000 calorie day meal plan - rest day

Apologies for rambling. 

A bit of background first. I'm a 20 year old female. 5'5"" Have always been super thin and with the best metabolism ever. Have always ate like shit. Aka fast food all the time

I just finished school in December and live LITERALLY right across the street from a massive gym. Finally got a membership beginning of January. Am paying for a trainer right now because I had no idea on what kinds of exercises to do and what proper form would be for my main goal which was gaining strength and toning. I know I could GOOGLE these things but I like having someone to show me what to do

I meet with the PT twice a week, and then another 3 sets with 3-4 different exercises than the first time. Usually the exercises are with dumbbells and bars, and we vary a lot. I've been doing lots of planks, and negative pull-ups (let-downs, I call them). Lots of squats and lunges. When I'm there by myself I pick a 45 min ""get strong"" workout on the Nike Training Club app, and then do 15 min of cardio after. Usually the elliptical or the bike. When personal training is over I am going to start SS. 

As for eating, and tastes amazing and then I drink about 2-3 big glasses of milk. Few hours later, have a snack. Usually almonds or some veggies. Lunch consists of spinach wraps with either turkey or chicken, yogurt and granola, more veggies, and an apple. Lots of water. I usually work out in the afternoon so afterwards I make a massive smoothie. Strawberries, mixed berries, flaxseed, and some vegegreens. Make just under 1L of that stuff

It's been a month now of all of this. I don't get fatigued anymore like I used to. I enjoy working out. I enjoy eating healthy. The biggest struggle has been eating MORE. I used to think I ate a lot until I got the MyFitnessPal app and realized that I wasn't. 

I've gone from 113 - 118 pounds. I weighed myself today and was 119. WOO, I feel good!

I'm glad this subreddit is here. Most of my friends don't care that I have decided to change my life around and become healthy. They call me crazy because I want to get some muscle. Like girls aren't supposed to be strong. :\ I have about 2-3 friends that I can seriously talk to about this stuff because they also go to the gym and are looking to become stronger. So hopefully I can be welcomed with open arms. :)

1368430772.0,1e8ey4,You Can Squat More,onemessageyo,60,26,45,"So today and yesterday I've been thinking about ending things with my girl. I have a bunch of reasons I won't get into but I've been a little down today. Not because I'm going to miss her but because I know I'm going to make her cry and I know I'm not going to be able to console her about it. I felt shitty after work and took a little nap. I barely ate today and chugged ~1500 calories in a oat/protein shake to catch up and carb up for the gym.

I went to the gym way later than I usually go, good stuff.

I throw 45lbs on each side, making sure to tighten my posterior chain and quads, getting a nice bounce at the bottom of my reps. I got a nice pump going here. I'm really enjoying that I've taken my mind off of my stressors. No headphones here. Just meditative gentle grunting. I take a small lap and get underneat 175lbs. I'm all pumped up for my work sets and...DAMNNNN

Way harder than I expected. I missed my first workout in the 3 months on Saturday, the day after I miss one work out, not able to do 5lbs more than I started last week."" I felt like a disgrace. I kept my form tight and ignored all signals telling me I had to reset my weight. I finished the one set, ass to grass wondering how the hell I was going to do 4 more of those. (I do 2 warm up sets then 5x5 as heavy as I can, increasing 5-10lbs/week) I smacked myself in the face. I got beneath the bar. I looked in the mirror that was unfortunately there (I hate squatting in front of a mirror, it lets me see how hard it is for me) and I see myself turn into a 240lb beast. I know I can do this. I'm the fucking [strongest mother fucker in the world](http://youtu.be/YpC1KWe9dp8). I focusing extra on flexing every muscle in my body from my grip to hammies to my delts and traps and abs. I do a second set I almost called for help twice but focused. Kept my form perfect, ass to grass just giving 100% the whole time as I went up so slowly. I finish the set on the verge of tears. Holy shit

Holy shit. So I walk over and tell my friend who's using some machine that these squats were so much harder than I expected. I felt like a tool coming to this gym the first time having so much trouble on my first two sets, I set the weight down to 175 for my last three sets. 

The point here is not to do 22% more weight than you planned to do on a dangerous lift. The point is that real failure happens way after your mind tries to convince you it has. The true measure of a man is what he does when he's weak.

I feel like I'm going to gain 10lbs from the those squats alone. After that I set a PR of 195 on DL, 1x5. I feel pretty beast atm, although I just realized I lost my wallet. To make this post more valid I'm going to post pictures I took of myself flexing tonight that I'm waiting for my friend to send to me. 

* This was me January http://i.imgur.com/kZka0nE.jpg
* This was me two weeks ago http://imgur.com/rDGzCCX,Z7goQDo#0
* I will edit in tonight's pictures as soon as a get them.

Edit: Still waiting on those pictures. Due to the request of a few people who messaged me, you're not going to deep enough or your not squatting enough. I squeeze the muscles I want to use. I envision myself as a 240lb beast, and much like Arnold I think about moving mountains as I lift. I literally try to feel my muscles getting bigger through my lifts. On the way down, I'm preparing myself for the way up. If my last set is ever to easy, I make it harder by leaving my muscles under the tension. I'll go up super slow. This often makes people think I'm going to fail. I don't care what they think. I'm not there for them. I don't laugh in the gym. I don't joke about my fitness. I know this post was a little comical, but I'm very serious when it comes to lifting and eating, and I get quite offended when someone tries to tell me to use machines or to run cardio for an hour. Even worse when they try to offer me junk food. I don't eat garbage.

**Ok so diet-wise let's get my stack out of the way:**

* ON 100% Gold Standard Whey. Probably the most used whey in the US
* Animal Pak, vitamins, mineral, liver protection, and a whole bunch of other shit that's been really good to me. I've noticed way less dips in my energy levels with this, and I feel healthier in general. I haven't gotten sick at all since starting animal pak and I think it's a great thing to take especially when you limit the variety in your diet for simplicity.
* Universal Nutrition's Real Gains. Good stuff
* ACG3. A pretty sick PWO in my opinion although it is a little caffeine heavy. I'm waiting for a sample of Shock Therapy by Universal Nutrition and I might switch to something else just because if I take enough ACG3 to get a good pump
* Marijuana. I take a couple of hits right before going in

**Here's an average day in my diet (please note that I estimate calories throughout the day

* I wake up hungry as hell. I aim for 5 eggs, tomatoes, and ham.
* I used to eat 2 cups of oatmeal
* I make a weight gainer shake for work with whole milk and as much olive oil as I can stomach. I'm a butcher and I need the calories to throw around lambs and boxes of chicken and shit.
* I always think about my lunch for at least an hour before I take it (I get 30 minutes at work). I usually go with either a big ass burrito complete with beef, avacado, etc. Sometimes I'll feel beast and just get some hot sauce and buy a whole cooked chicken/turkey breast with one of those 30g protein Naked Juices.
* Towards the end of work on my last (15 minute) break
* When I get home I usually have a piece of red meat or fish (either trout if I'm broke
* I chase that meat/rice meal with a protein shake
* At this point it's around 8pm and I try to completely avoid carbs. I'll eat a smaller (4oz-6oz) piece of meat/fish by itself and have a protein shake. One of these will be right before bed and one will be around 9-10. Cottage cheese and casein supplements are just do damn expensive for me right now and if I really needed to

**This is my routine**

* I go Tues, my first time since I've started lifting again about 4-5 months ago. Days go ABA, BAB, etc.

* **A Day**
* 5x5 Squat (175? 215? LOL
* 5x5 Bench (175)
* 5x5 Bent Rows (130)
* 3x8 Shrugs (215)
* 3x8 Skullcrusher (75)
* 3x5 Chin ups (trying to work my way to 3x8 before adding weight. Before I could do chin ups I was doing curls here)
* 2x10 Hyperextentions (70)
* 3x15 Kneeling Cable Crunches (I set the stack on the cable machine to 57.5
* 3x8 Calf Raises. (Haven't really done these in weeks because I tend to pull my plantar muscle everytime I attempt calf raises in my chuck taylors.)

* **B Day**
* 5x5 Squat
* 1x5 DL (195)
* Press (70) (I injured my shoulder 11 days ago and I've been trying to recover. I reset my weight and I'm not going to push this hard until my AC joint is back to where it used to be.)
* 5x5 Bent Rows
* 5x5 Close grip bench (What ever weight I used on the previous A day)
* 3x5 Chins
* 3x10 Kneeling cable crunch.

This is my very recent gainit journey which has been very fulfilling to myself and has granted me a very big change in my life.  This is just as beginning of a new stage and day by day im looking forward on improving more.   

 This a long post and sorry in advance for any English mistake as it is my 2nd language. 

**Progress album:** http://imgur.com/a/rBiqe


* **Previous story:**

    Im 21 years old and just 5”4 tall.  I’ve always been athletic but only in light sports,  I always  had that sensation that I didn’t impose any presence, and felt very underwhelmed when hanging with normal / bigger people.  My friends threw jokes like:  man, if you keep like that, you’re going to disappear from this world.

    About 2 years ago I hit a low 114-115 lb, just stayed home playing guitar, wow and studying.  During this time my younger brother was already 6 months into the gym and it shocked how much it transformed,   it really hit me that my younger brother now looks like my old brother and my guardian,   this is when I decided to take a change.

* **Gainit path**

    Started unofficially and completely inexperienced around march this year (weighting around 116lb) .  I Started going to the gym in my residence (which is very crappy) and did lifts here and there without a routine. I started a new job by that time and it was extremely hard to eat good as I ate horrible before and my appetite was inexistent.    Short story

    Started going to the gym around may 15th just when summer started until today and only took a 2 week break around august when I travelled.  Im training 4 days a week in a very good gym with the help of a coach and a planned meals.  Diet pretty much consisted on 4 full meals a day + 2 services of supper mass gainer shakes ( 1 in the morning and 1 after training).  I probably averaged 2800-3200 calories a day and avoided fast foods and sodas.  I can report later what im lifting now in terms of wheights.  I also don´t skip legs and have gained a nice amount there.
 
* **Current feelings:**

    I can only tell that ive never felt better before.  I can finally fill a t shirt, I think those gains were pretty substantial . Feel free to gives comments or ask any question.

   I have to say lurking /r/gainit helped me alot motivation wise

* **Hitting a wall:**

    I haven´t been making any notable progress the last 4-5 weeks. First I started noticing more overall fat, I can tell that I did not make any notable gain the last month, just slightly more strength.  

    I really don´t know how to continue now, I don’t take it back but still.   The thing is i think I have to keep drinking super mass gainers to make progress but I don’t know how much fat I can take..  What can I do?? I am completely lost here.   As for genetics if that matters, most in my family are short and skinny fat.

    
TLDR:  Went from skinny bones to decent looking and now I’ve hit a wall with my progress.

I started working out


Three years of progress later (and yes, which makes me more prone to injury from lifting. Luckily, I don't have it as bad as most do, and the more muscle I gain the better ""connected"" my body will be. It does become an issue, because my wrists are weaker than they should be and are not keeping up with my deadlift (245x5 on the hexagon deadlift bar - I do use Versa Gripps straps to assist weak wrists). Occasionally my wrists get blown out (most likely my extensor muscles in the forearm) and greatly hinders my gym workouts for at least 1-3 months. If anyone has advice on how to get solid forearms, that would be appreciated!

Really enjoying peanut butter


**Blend 2 cups of oats by themselves into a powder**(tip: dry the blender if it's been recently washed before you do this.):600 cal/104 carb/20 bro

**Add:**

**7 cups of Milk** (I used whole):1

**3 cups of Peanut butter**:4

**4 scoops of brotein powder** (I used Optimum's chocolate whey:480 cal/12 carb/96 bro 

**5 Bananas**:441 cal/81 carb/3 bro

**2 cups of vanilla yogurt**:360 cal/58 carb/20 bro

**2 Tbsp of Nutella**:200 cal/22 carb/3 bro  

**2 tsp of honey**:120 cal/34 carb

You don't need a gallon sized blender just use the milk wisely. I also bought a rubbermaid gallon bottle that I pour it in and shake it all together at the end.

**Totals: Calories-7

**8 oz serving:487/35/23**

**20 oz serving(full blender bottle):1

This shake tastes much better and is cheaper than most commercial gainers and hopefully has a lot less sugar. Plus if you get bored with it you can always try changing to different flavors of yogurts or brotein. Maybe add a cup or your favorite ice cream or berries.

I didn't count the fat because a good chunk of it is healthy fat from the peanut butter. And I'm not to worried as much about fat intake as of yet.

1345939669.0,ytw44,A little motivation courtesy of Henry Rollins,punkandy26,39,4,5,"The Iron
by Henry Rollins


I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.

Completely.

When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, wondering why.

I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.

I hated myself all the time.

As stupid at it seems now, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn't going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you'll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time. I didn't think much of them either.

Then came Mr. Pepperman, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.

He told me that I was going to take some of the money that I had saved and buy a hundred-pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, but I couldn't even drag them to my mom's car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.

Monday came and I was called into Mr. P.'s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn't looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time was I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn't want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.

Weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.

Right before Christmas break I was walking to class

It took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, it wouldn't teach you anything. That's the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble. That which you work against will always work against you.

It wasn't until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking

I used to fight the pain

I have never met a truly strong person who didn't have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone's shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr.Pepperman.

Muscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.

Yukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion

Everything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt

I prefer to work out alone.

It enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you're made of is always time well spent

I see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly

Through the years, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.

The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential

The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.

I don't want to go to a gym at the moment as I want to put some weight on first (my self confidence is that bad...)
I can buy dumbells for home and do pushups etc but I'm not sure what routine I should follow

I'm finally trying to do something about it after a great lack of motivation for the past few years of my life

Thanks!

I've always been pretty skinny because I used to barely eat. I find it hard for me to be hungry and I have an extremely fast metabolism so I find it very hard to retain weight I put on. But I forced myself to eat more and I started using Optimum Nutrition's whey about a month ago to help get more protein in my diet. I've also been drinking much more water.

Male, started at 175 lb., goal was 200 in six months, but only got to 195. I'm attributing this to having to skip a few weeks (not consecutive) due to sickness and injury.

I lift 4 times a week, while letting muscle groups rest at least a day, and using each group twice a week. I can post a detailed schedule if someone wants to see it.

My main focus has been on chest, since my legs are hams, due to soccer, mountain biking, running, etc.

Diet is mostly protein shake (with creatine), frozen veggies, rice, and pasta.

As for the nutrition/working out - I had just posted them on the other thread



Nutrition : On a good day - Breakfast(7am) - Oatmeal Snack(10am) - Glass of milk and peanut butter toast Pregym snack(11:30a) - Toast Gym during lunch(noon) post gym gainer shake, or something small..protein related. Dinner - This varies, honestly I try to make it protein focused but it doesn't always end up that way. My girlfriend loves tacos, so I usually cook those. Before bed - I'll usually drink atleast 1-2 glasses of milk. This is a pretty good day, and I don't always stick to it. I just always try to keep eating every 3-4 hours or so
Workout- It's changed a lot from time to time. On average I do about 4-5 days a week working out. I'll usually do Chest twice a week(because it builds poorly), and an all around day where I work on whatever it is i feel I lacked that week. I've went from doing cardio and running every other day training, to doing absolutely no cardio at all.

For diet: I've found that eggs in the morning and a healthy meaty sandwich (usually turkey on wheat) for lunch help a lot

For workouts: I rotate on a 4 day workout with a lot of variation. The main days for me are [back and bi's], and [chest and tri's]. I work out abs every other day, and am stopping hard cardio until I feel I've gained enough weight. REMEMBER: It's hard to gain weight if you're using all your calories during cardio.

Some might ask: if I cut out cardio
My answer: No

The most important thing I've learned so far (for me) is that I haven't been getting enough calories to gain weight. Try doing physical activities during the day that don't necessarily raise your heart rate to a point that you're burning a lot of calories

Hope this helped.

TLDR: 1. Do physical activities that don't burn too many calories to raise appetite. 2. Eat more healthy foods and snacks even if they don't taste good

You should see results within a few weeks to a month. I gained around 4 or 5 pounds in a month. Any more than this is somewhat unhealthy

http://i.imgur.com/5GfYJZi.jpg

Took me about a 7-8 months to get the bulk of the gains. I went from 66kg to 70-72kg slowly initially then I started to take diet more seriously and gained very fast.

Goal is to get to about 90kg. Currently 18 years of age.



At request of some people I'll go into more detail.


I work out 5-6 times a week. It's usually 3 days on 1 day off. 

**Shoulders/Chest:**

Incline dumbbell press

Dumbbell pull overs

Flat dumbbell press. 

Arnold press or Shoulder press.

Lateral delt raise

Front delt raise

Rear delt raise or Face pulls.

Shrugs

**Arms/back:**

Pull ups or chin ups to failure as warmup.

Lat pull down wide grip 

Lat pull down close grip

Seated rows

Dumbbell rows

Barbell curl to failure x 2

Concentration curls

Pinwheel curls supersetted with hanging from a power rack for forearms.

Tricep pull downs

Tricep kickbacks

Tricep overhead extension or dumbbell extensions.

**Legs/Abs:**

Squats with just bar

Bulgarian squats

Sumo squats

Stiff legged dumbbell deadlift

Hanging Leg raises

Plank

Side Plank

Crunches

Bicycles on back

Barbell twists






I train 3 days hypertrophy(light weight/high reps) then 3 days strength(high weight/low reps). 3 or 4 sets going to failure on the last set.An example would be on hypertrophy back days I dumbbell row 20kg for 10 nice and slow reps for four sets whilst on strength day I will do 3 sets of 6 with 40kg with slightly worse form.


The reason I didn't put my routine initially is because I don't think anyone shoulder be doing the same routine as anyone else unless your goal is simply building raw mass and strength. If you are bodybuilding I think you personally need to look in the mirror and see how you need to sculpt your body to get the best look with the body you have. My routine took me long to formulate and I am constantly cycling different exercises in and out to see what best suites me and you should do the same in my opinion. You need to do the research yourself at the end of the day and make a routine for yourself because no one routine works for everyone. Learn what muscles do what and proper form for exercises.

Over the past year, I was fine because i wasn't overweight, but I had to begin looking at it as just as bad. Plus looking at how much more mature and filled out us men look with some weight was another tipping point as I've had so much insecurity with masculinity, being a generally quiet and gentle guy. Being mistaken for 17, or having other guys hit on my fiancee in my presence, done with that!

I have a really busy life, it's how I've been justifying not taking care of myself. A few weeks ago I began trying to eat more and load up, it was hard because I hated cooking and the time it took, plus the time it took to eat. In a stroke of luck as I see it, my fiancee started college about a month ago and I was tasked with breakfast and dinner for the family out of necessity. I used to love to cook, and I've found that passion again so I could check off that excuse. 

The next thing was the exercise, working out needed to become my lifestyle. So I decided to just start creating the habit. 

Last week, 17. I felt like shit about myself and my arms hurt the next day so I skipped a day. After the pain faded, I committed myself to trying for 3x15 a day of pushups a day, and I did it. Yesterday, I upped myself to 3x20. and halfway through the pain faded, I felt my breathing relax with each pump all of a sudden, and i just stopped counting until i got to ~80. As little working out as I've done, and today marks the true beginning of my journey. It will be slow

When i was a baby and started eating i was really fussy with food. I remember only liking chocolate and ice cream. Everything was force fed to me. I refused to eat even when they thought i would eventually eat anything when im hungry. This was not the case. This happened for a while and i got sent to hospital and fed through tubes until i was better. From that day on my family were more strict to make me eat wht they wanted. 

As i became older around 6-7 i still remember only eating my moms food. When we went out i would refuse to eat any proper meal but my moms food. I also used to eat really small portions. When i get forced to eat more than the portion i ate i remember throwing up because it was too much. 

As i grew older 11-12 years old i realised something might be wrong with me. I was feeling painful stomach aches. Doctors said it was probably heartburn and gave me gaviscon. Which didnt really help. A month later i went on holiday to damascus where i felt even worse. My stomach ache worsened and i was sent to hospital. I dont remember what happened to me but i stayed in hospital for while. I was given medication. I felt better.

Something felt odd though. Ever since that day i didnt feel hunger.

Here's what you'll need for the filling:

* 1.2kg (~2.6lbs) chicken breast - $8.80

* 180g (~.4lb) onion - 50c

* 400g (~.9lb) tin of kidney beans - 80c

* 400g (~.9lb) tin of chickpeas - 80c

* 400g (~.9lb) tin of tomato - 80c

* 453g (1lb) jar of salsa - $4.50

Total cost = $16.20

It requires minimal effort to cook; brown the onion in an oiled pan

I put the lot all into some plastic containers of about 350-400g which is a perfect amount for the tortillas I get. If I'm feeling lazy it's tasty enough just to heat up and eat from the container which is what I find myself doing at uni all the time.

About 90-120 min at 200 degrees (F) will have it just cooked all the way through and JUICY.

2 thighs with skin etc is about 800 cals right there and it's a LOT more flavorful than boiled chicken!  All my coworkers are SUPER jealous of my lunches.

I've been gaining for just a few weeks now and I have a question about these two exercises. The gym I'm at right now is very small and doesn't even have a bar for bench press. It only has dumbbells. So I usually get a pair of 40lbs and do my set. What I was wondering is how does that translate to my max on a bar? Does that mean I can only bench press 80lbs with a bar? So if the bar is 45lbs I can only put 15-20lbs on each side?

Also just for reference

The totals for ""actual"" was summing the wrong cell in the ""second snack"" chart. I updated the link with the corrected version.


Hey Gainit

I made an Excel spreadsheet to better track my caloric and macro intake. It's a pretty basic model that I'm sure people more Excel-experienced than me can improve but I think it's a good start. Since this is all based on only a little bit of research

Macro conversion rates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUTPd9mTvWY

Nutrition values: straight from packages whenever I could. For fruits/vegetables/meats


**A little about the workbook:**

The structure of the workbook relies on ""vlookup, simply type in whatever food you want to add (exactly as it's written on the ""food chart"" tab, capitalization doesn't matter) and the values will auto adjust.
 
The two highlighted cells in the ""Summary"" tab are the only areas that you'd need to adjust to meet your specific goals (and any foods that you want to add/delete...just make sure when adding more rows in the ""Food Chart"" tab to drag down from the bottom of the table

Right now it's set for my specifics/goals , I would suggest using the word ""blank"" (or whatever else you want to change it to) instead of deleting rows since it will make the formatting and functions work a lot better. Also, I manually added 100 calories to cardio days to make up for some of the burned calories...you'll have to manually remove those in the ""metrics"" chart. Any modifications represent add-ons/subtractions from the preset amounts...you'll have to manually change those, as well.

This is my first Reddit post

I'm a 23 year old University student, and have loved seeing the success stories of others. You see, I'm...very skinny. I know it's not because I'm some kind of genetic freak or anything like that; it's because I don't eat as much as I should. I get that. I have a very tight budget of only $200 a month for food, and I figured today is as good a time as any to start bulking up.

To get started into the meat of this post

Gender: Male
Age: 23 Years
Weight: 120 lbs. (54.5kg)
Height: 5' 6"" (66"")
Bodyfat: 4% (Measured with bodyfat calipers)
TDEE (w/ exercise 3 times a week): 2000~2300
Time lifting weights seriously: NEWBIE

The equipment I have at home (I prefer to work out at home if I can) is as follows:

Bench Press (Bench
2 Spinlock
Weight plates (2x25, 4x2.5) [Weight in pounds]
Exercise mat
Doorframe chin-up/pull-up bar
20lb Kettlebell
2x 10lb dumbbells
Weighted jump rope
Push-up bars

Ok

1. I can't do squats with weight, and are a vital piece of any workout, but I simply cannot do them. Would KB Swings compensate at least somewhat?

2. I've followed Stronglifts 5x5 for the past month

Is there a way I can workout at home, but is the lack of squats with weight a major limiting factor for mass gain?

Is there something anyone could suggest I follow as a program for mass gain? Ideally I'd like to be at 145lbs

Can a guy whose been told he's a hardgainer

So, and lift for 3 sets of 8-12 reps/5 sets of 5 reps""? Can it really be that simple? Anyone care to help me find out?

Intraworkout I took Xtend for the Amino acids (I also drank an Xtend every morning). I took daily vitamins and fish oil everyday as well.

Thanks to this friend, and the increased appetite that came with it, I quickly put on my first 5-10 lbs, but didn't really make any effort towards gaining anymore. As enough time passed I hit my goal of 180 and was satisfied. For about a year. I still didn't quite like my appearance, knowing that I could be bigger and look better so I added another goal: 190 lbs. 

This one actually took effort on my part in terms of eating. I learned what my friend meant every time he said, I was rarely hungry and ate myself to fill. But that wasn't enough. I learning to really shovel down food at every meal and surpassed 190 lbs. 

And then this past winter break came. I got sick to where I couldn't work out for a week

Progress: [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/jEXDj)  (all of them except for today's were taken post-workout)

And so now that I've reached 195 I've hit another mental barrier. I keep asking myself ""Have I become big enough?"" So my question for you gainit is whether I should stay at my current weight or gain those last 10 pounds?

Its just that I have gotten a million great pieces of advice on here that have helped so much and wanted to do something to give back. I may not have all the scientific knowledge but i really just wanted to share my story and to give some motivation to those new lifters out there or people who are just losing that feeling they had when they started.

Anyway, and i still have my 6 pack! Some of you may say, ""OH JEEZE I DONT WANT TO WAIYT A HOLE YEAR 2 GET 25 POWNDS"" (dramatization of what will probably actually be said) but alas, the reason I am ecstatic about that gain is that i did not even realize how much progress that was. Day to day you will (if you are like me) will check out and analyze every muscle in your upper body (or lower body if you're like that ;) ) while you are brushing your teeth and thus you will lose the overall perspective of gains made. I remember when i struggled knocking out 10 reps of 135 on bench, and now i threw up 185 5 times the other day without needing spot. That was literally my goal from the moment i started lifting, to be able to lift 185 one time without help. I completely forgot till i found an old list of goals i wrote down when i started lifting. 

I really just want everyone to step back and think about all the progress you've made. People are so worried on here sometimes about gaining alot of muscle way to fast and it really makes me upset. I know some of you just want to be that guy in the gym everyone is jealous of

This may come off totally lame, you look like you are 135 lbs. But guess what? I threw it on and it fit like any other shirt. In fact, i started putting on all the shirts i had that were mediums, and i really noticed they were way to small. All my larges that i was so afraid to wear are the only shirts that really fit me well. 

So basically the goal of this

**Middle School**

When I was younger I used to always think being thin was good. People called my skinny all the time and I embraced it. Hey

Looking back

I kinda backed off from sports by the end of middle school and finished eighth grade at 5'4"" and 120. I couldn't find any pictures of myself from this time.

&gt;2008: 5'4"" and 120 lbs

**High School**

I transferred to a small school (~120 kids/grade) and was determined to redefine myself. This didn't work very well due to the fact that I never really talked with anyone haha. I hung with a small group of friends (who were also new) and none of us put any effort into mixing with the existing student population (this school was 6-12th grade). I should also note that I got back into soccer due to pressure from my parents.

&gt;[2009: 6' and 145 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/SGYwW5ah.jpg)

I backed off (again) from sports after 10th grade and started eating out of boredom. Near the beginning of 11th grade I clocked in at around 6'1"" and 165 lbs (no muscle at all at this point; all fat).

&gt;[2010: 6'1"" and 165 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/j4zsm4A.jpg)

In spring of 11th grade I realized I needed to change my life for the better. I got back into sports (lacrosse) and really cut back on my eating. 

During fall of 12th grade (2011) I was 6'3"" and 155 lbs. Even though I was thin again

&gt;[Late 2011: 6'3""' and 155 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/msQ7BY9h.jpg)

&gt;[Additional pic from homecoming](http://i.imgur.com/vPTbpmJ.jpg)

I was hanging out with a lot nicer kids and wanted to improve myself even more. I asked my family to sign up for a local gym and started lifting weights 3 times a week a friend. 

At this point I had just started using the bench press and could max out at 85 lbs.
* 
By the end of the year I had made noticeable improvements in my arms. My peers really didn't notice until the end of the year when we had our 'Senior Squirt Day' and came to school in bathing suits and armed with squirt guns to torment the underclassmen. I caught a lot of girls staring and got comments like ""Man I didn't know you were ripped"" and ""You have the best beach body"".

It REALLY boosted my self confidence.

**College

I started school at the University of Florida (Go Gata) and immediately took advantage of the awesome weight room they have. I was still pretty thin but at least was making progress on muscle size.

&gt;[Late 2012: 6'3"" and 165 lbs. Bodypainted for front row seats at the opening game! I'm the tall guy in the middle](http://i.imgur.com/4D9cYxd.jpg)

It took me a while to adjust to college life and kinda stayed to myself during the first semester. I got myself a girlfriend ([pic

Spring semester is a whole different story. I realized that my girlfriend was holding me hostage from the rest of the world and ended things with her right before the new year.

I made new girl friends, anyone?](http://i.imgur.com/lLLwVNw.jpg)), and hit the gym even harder. I was doing a 5 day routine as follows (more details at bottom of post):

* Monday - Arms (Biceps
* Tuesday - Legs
* Wednesday - Chest
* Thursday - Back
* Friday - Shoulders
* Saturday

I started going downtown to clubs and got sucked into the whole Pickup Artist deal. I know it might sound bogus

This was a big game changer for me. 

I was now able to walk into a club

&gt;[June 2013: 6'4"" and 185 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/s9d6o0U.jpg)

I've been busy working during the summer but am trying hard to maintain my size while at home. I can now max out on the bench at 260 and hope to be in the 300 club by this Christmas.

I decided to visit friends taking summer courses at UF for the 4th of July and had a blast. I was also a huge hit with the ladies. Back of my car

*I give all credit for my recent success in life to lifting and the pickup community. I'm so happy I found this community and am motivated to continue by watching my fellow redditors make progress with me. 10 more pounds until my goal weight!*

[**TL;DR Read it! But here's a progress pic of me before and after I started lifting**](http://i.imgur.com/jTWLGuP.jpg)

Feel free to PM me about my lifting routine or anything about pickup stuff. I'm happy to help you guys out!

Edit: Added a couple more pics and details

Edit 2: Added detailed routine here

My 5 day split is a slightly modified version of a ['high-definition' routine](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/24-doug---s-5-day-high-definition-routine.html) I found online (all exercises are 3 sets x 8 reps unless otherwise mentioned).

Monday - Arms:

* Biceps - Barbell curl
* Biceps - Hammer curl (left arm
* Biceps - Concentration curl
* Triceps - Lying tricep extension/skullcrushers
* Triceps -  Rope pushdown
* Triceps - Bar pushdown (burnout on high weight; as many as you can with perfect form)

Tuesday - Legs:

* Quads - Squats
* Quads - Leg press
* Quads - Leg extension
* Hamstrings - Deadlifts
* Calves - Seated calf raise (I do these on the leg press machine)
* Forearms - Wrist curls

Wednesday - Chest:

* Pecs - Decline Bench/Regular Bench (I like the decline more to target lower pecs
* Upper Pecs - Incline bench
* Outer chest - Cable crossovers
* Chest - Incline flys

Thursday - Back:

* Back - Bent over barbell row (form is really important on this one)
* Back - Wide grip pulldown
* Back - Low rows
* Back - High rows
* Lower back - Hyperextension (3 sets x 12

Friday - Shoulders:

* Shoulders - Dumbbell press
* Shoulders - Side lateral raises
* Shoulders - Front lateral raises
* Shoulders - Rear delt fly (I usually find a machine for this
* Shoulders - Dumbbell shrugs
* Shoulders - Barbell shrugs (hands facing away from each other for good grip

You'll notice there are no core exercises in here. You should work on those every day. I have an ab wheel that I like to use Tues,Sun (timed holds at fully extended position for sets of 30, 45, and 60 seconds) and on M,W,F I do stuff like L-shaped pullups, weighted crunches (machine), but any oblique exercises are good).

Hi. Just discovered this sub-reddit and thought I'd give a quick update and some help if anyone wants it. 

Stats:
28 yrs old, 156 lbs.

Current Lifts:

Bench 195 x 5

Deadlift 285 x 5

Squat 225 x 10

Workout Routines:

First 2 months I did [kris gethin's](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer.html). I took a month off for travel

Diet:

Meal 1 - Oatmeal /w banana &amp; natural peanut butter mashed in. 3 hard boiled eggs

Meal 2 - Homemade shake. 16oz 2% milk, 2 scoops of BSN strawberry protein, ice

Meal 3 - grilled chicken breast

meal 4- Sweet potato

Workout

2 scoops of BSN chocolate protein

#5 Post workout meal - chicken breast

#6 - cottage cheese /w frozen fruit. 

Sometimes I get sick of the food and I'll go out and eat. Usually panera bread or Chipotle bowl. 

Supplements

BSN protein, ON BCAA, C4 preworkout, NOW Gingseng (more for my brain), 

**Tips**

Honestly everything you need to know is in this forum.

* Workout CONSISTENTLY. I have been working out 5x a week for 3 months straight
* Weight yourself every week
* Sleep 8 hrs a day
* Make your meals ahead of time. It's Sunday
* Do WHATEVER it takes to stay motivated. If I dont feel like going to the gym I watch Zyzz or Frank Yang videos. Look at pics of Arnold. DO NOT MISS THAT WORKOUT.

Honestly, and they will add up.

My goal is to get to 170 lbs

He is an exemplary example of what we all should strive to do: work hard, and let the muscle come on. Staying dedicated over 15 months is no easy task, but he did it and the results clearly paid off.

Excerpt from the post; If you read anything you should at least read this:

&gt; ###Prologue:
&gt; I remember years ago when I first started working out and posting here I went out and put together a program all on my own. I thought it through very thoroughly and was very proud of myself when I'd finished. I made a new thread about it and asked for people to critique it in the title. I expected for the most part people would approve of it and might offer tiny suggestions to improve on it.

&gt; What I got was people telling me it was awful and I needed to scrap it completely and pick up a pre-made program which was created by someone who was an expert in the weightlifting/strength training or bodybuilding field.

&gt; I was upset and annoyed at the time

&gt; Ask yourself this: Do you know more than Mark Rippetoe, ""no"").

&gt; Then why would you use some program you've made over one of theirs?",,t5_2s9bg,False,,tier1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1f1x0d/why_nobody_is_critiquing_your_workout_read_this/

* gain muscle mass
* lose fat

My physique is of such kind that if it were left to a sedentary kind of lifestyle, back, and lower legs. In fact that's the way it is. 

[Here

The picture on the left is me in mid 2009; the picture at the right is me in 2013 (which is what I also looked like in late '08

What you are seeing above is the result of a combined effort to lose fat: I combined strength training (just a full-body workout routine) with jogging gently at such a pace as to promote fat loss (so no endurance-training-type running activities). This worked back in '09. Then things happened and I'm back to being skinny-fat.

My plan was to gain muscle mass following the achievement of the fat-loss goal, etc.). 

Anyway so my approach had been:

* lose fat first

and I have this experience to confirm that it works (at least as far as losing fat is concerned).

There were drawbacks: yes there was no longer a gut, or skinny with a gut.

But there are two other possibilities I haven't yet tried and wanted to ask (before I tried either to save me some time). Namely

* gain muscle mass first and gain fat along with it

* why not both? (gain muscle

Has anyone had any success with either approach? If so

Surprisingly I have not gone to the gym yet, and it has been learning to cook new things everyday. The biggest thing for me was quitting nicotine though, because that shit ruins an appetite like no other. I have been tracking my calories very loosely, and have been shooting for around 3000 cals a day. 

Anyway, but that number felt awesome and rewarding as fuck. I'm going to try to make it to 160 within the next few months, maybe even 165. I plan on doing a progress pic update when I get 165.

Few quick food tips: 

1) Easy breakfast with around 800+ calories: Muffin with large glass of chocolate milk (2 cups). Prepared in 15 seconds lol

Hey gainit

This shows my bulk cut progress from July to December

I spent about 2/3 of my time this year cutting 1/3 bulking.

2013 will be 6 month of bulk

Diet while bulking was 2.8 - 3.2k calories with 60% protein

I did strength training 3 days a week from January to July 2012. I then did 4 days a week strength training

I am doing a 4 day split for 6 months

I have never slow bulked

Will try slow bulk Jan-Feb to assess how to limit fat gains. 

Ask any questions.

Lift numbers from Jan - December 2012 for 5 reps:

Bench 60KG-91.5KG
OHP 40KG - 62.2KG
Squat - 40KG  - 113.5KG
Deadlift - 60KG - 116KG (started this late)

Day 2 Update - Definitely shouldn't have started with a whole gallon

Days 3&amp;4 - Been drinking as much milk as my body will allow but letting how I feel dictate how much and how often. Averaged about a half gallon each of these days. Lifted yesterday
EDIT: Weighed in at 147 at the gym. My weight fluxuates a lot so I wouldn't contribute it all to pure gain but its more than I've weighed in months after only 4 days of starting the diet.

Today marked the end of the first week of doing it. Also the first time since the first day i got a stomach ache, mostly in my midsection. I feel a little stronger in my squats at the same weight, and I have also experienced a 10 increase in my bench press, from repping 155 to lifting 165 today which is the most I've benched in my life. I weighed in at 145 today, 2 lbs less than the last time I weighed myself but still heavier than i started out at.  Stay tuned for more.  ",,False,t5_2s9bg,True

So 7 months  i was tired of being a skinny guy.I got motivated and started going to the gym 6 times a week.The days i didht go to the gym i was doing calisthenics and managed to do my first muscle up.


I havent eaten junk food for 2 months now nor drunk sodas.
I try to eat healthy and lots of food.I also got my first whey protein.

What I've learnt those 7 months is that you can do anything if you want it really bad and keep on trying.There were days where i couldht eat more or was sore and wanting to give up but those days are the most important.I still have A LOT OF WAY but for the fist time of my life im happy with my progress.:D

My information:
    145lbs / 20yrs old / 6'2"" / Male
    Goal is to gain about 10-20 pounds and create muscle while minimizing fat gain. (Easier said than done)
    Quit smoking about a week ago. I really just want to be physically and mentally peaked and my motivation finally overcame my addiction.
    In terms of a history of diet/exercise: I ran varsity track for 3 years in high school (long distance, completely took a turn for the shitter and started smoking, drinking, and treating my body like complete shit.
    I have access to a full gym btw.
    And I have a fucking incinerator in place of a human stomach that just destroys everything I put in my body to make sure I stay a lanky

Okay, good sleep, do GOMAD, and eat about 3500 calories a day along with a workout plan. I ditched the running playlist and made a lifting playlist. I'm all set to go as I lay my first meal of 5 eggs, 2 pieces of toast with peanut butter and a glass of whole milk. On the first day, I ate like a madman and afterwards, felt like I was going to puke my stomach out. So I figured this would only last a day or two then I'd get used to eating such a large of amount of food (please note: I'm a runner. Always have been. It's all I'm good at. So I've never had an ounce of fat on my body because I just ran it off. Going from eating once a day and having ciggarettes as meals to eating 3-4 times a day was a huge shock to my body and it still is).

So here I am today, tips, comments, suggestions for me? Maybe something the FAQs dont mention. 

TLDR; I'm tall and skinny

Something to note: I took whey for the first month, I have been **supplement free** (I do take a multivitamin and fish oil). 

NOTE that I am not anti-supplement. I AM against the idea that whey (or even creatine) is considered a requirement. 

I started with a 3 day split that focused on the big three lifts plus shoulder press for the first three months. That got me up to 146lbs and 135 bench, and have been focusing more on endurance lifting and hypertrophy. My lifts are now 180x2 bench, 225x6 squat (high bar, ass-to-grass - I'd estimate my low bar 90* 1rm squat to be around 250, maybe more), 345x10 deadlift.

I don't know what my starting bodyfat was

Sample day of food:

4 eggs scrambled

2 cups chocolate almond milk (for calcium)

1 can black beans

7oz dry roasted peanuts

Other staples are steel cut oats, pistachios (more of a treat), grapefruit, flounder.

**Background**: I've always been the short,""Do you have worms"" etc...So recently I decided to make it a priority to getting into weight training to try and add some muscle and fill out before summer comes.

My goal was to be realistic for my size, and a small dumbell set I had at home. I assume some of you are in this same position and only have a limited use of equipment, so I thought I'd share my limited results with what I had. In no way is my progress drastically significant, but I do feel more confident for summer and look forward to more gains now that my awesome wife surprised me with new equipment the other day!

**Routine: M/W/F**

* Incline bench 3x8
* Flat bench 3x8
* Lat Pull-Down 3x8
* Seated Cable Row 3x8
* Overhead Press 3 sets 10/8/6
* Front/Lateral dumbell raises 3x10
* Dumbell Squats
* Abs- Planks after every workout

**Diet**: I didn't keep a detailed journal because my goal at this point was just to add a few pounds. I just made sure to eat every two hours or so during the day

Good luck to everyone on their progress and gain that weight!

* **Powdered Protein**: The main staple of every shake. There are many different types (whey, egg, etc.) and flavors. Buy the best deal that has the least amount of fillers and added junk. Whey is the best all-around.
* **Oats** (1/2-1 cup):  Excellent source of complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. Best take earlier in the day and before a workout. Blend separately.
* **Bananas** (1-2): A good source of simple carbohydrates and extremely tasty. Best taken post workout; tastiest when blended frozen or very cold.
* **Almonds** (handful): Good fats and a decent amount of protein. Shred them separately.
* **Peanut butter** (1-2 tbsp): Good fats
* **Berries** (1/2 cup): Strawberries, antioxidant, and metabo boosting properties.
* **Milk** (2 cups): Skim, whole, chocolate... whichever is best for you. Milk packs a lot of caloriesm carbs, and protein and adds great taste to any shake. Best after a workout because it can feel heavy. Can be substituted with almond milk, coconut milk, or coconut water.
* **Olive oil** (1-2 tbsp): Each tablespoon is ~100 calories and rich in good fats. Amazing
* **Yogurt** (1/2 cup): Greek yogurt is especially good. It packs an excellent amount of protein and some good calories.
* **Cottage cheese** (1/2 cup): Same with most dairy. high in calories and protein
* **Ice**: Adds that smooth coolness to any shake.

Mix and match these ingredients to create your favorite protein shake.


My own personal recipes go something like:

Pre-workout or morning shake. This is a light shake to fuel me at the gym.

* 1 cup oats
* 1 handful almonds
* 1 1/2 scoop Cytosport 100% chocolate whey
* 1 cold banana
* 6-8 oz cold water

Post Workout shake:

* 1 handful almonds
* 1-2 scoops chocolate whey
* 2 cold bananas

The other problem is I have no weight and the budget requires that I put them off for now. So a natural work out plan or any ideas to use subs instead of weights would help.

Now A major problem is motivation and energy. I have notice that I can not walk long distances like a block or two with out the pain in the gut most will get if they walked 10 miles etc. Sad

It's my senior year of high school in the US and I'm about to start my wrestling season.

I have 14% body fat and the weight class i'm looking to fill for next year is the 160 lbs weight class.

The trainer at my gym started me on machines which I have been using for my primary workout each morning for the past two weeks. Literally everywhere I have read has provided the opinion that heavy lifts using a bar is the way to go for gains. It is mid-August and the first competition is in November. Can I put on almost 10 lbs of lean muscle between then and now using machines to reach just under 160 lbs? Could I do it using different exercises?

Any advice on continuing to exercise in a different manner or pertaining to my target weight would be extremely helpful. This subreddit is such a valuable source of knowledge I'm glad I found it.

I'm a 20 year old guy.


Diet:
My main issue is that I'm not consistent
I'm a student so the hardest part was making high calorie
I've always found breakfast is the hardest meal to get high calories as I usually have little time to cook. The best way I found was to make oatmeal. The recipe I go by is 1 large cup of oatmeal, raisins, almonds, tablespoon of cinnamon and sugar. It tastes pretty good and is very calorific. 
I started taking protein shakes around 2 months ago and have noticed quite a change


In terms of my routine I operate on a four day split with abs and core spread in between and some cardio for good measure when I see fit. On mondays I'll work chest and triceps, 5x5 skullcrushers, a set of decline push ups and finish off with a chest press until failure.
Wednesday is bicep and shoulders, 3x8 shoulder fly and shoulder fly at an angle (not sure the name for these). Then Hammer curls and open arm curls.
Friday is leg day which is pretty much just your basic squat routine
Sunday i'll work back which is just sets of wide grip pull ups

Edit for info: 

So the picture was from 2 years ago

Still

As far as diet goes, some a bit under. But I try and keep the average that way. I find if I eat any less I will instantly start losing weight. I cut a bit during December, got right back on it in January. A lot of Eggs, bacon, pasta, chicken. But also burgers, steaks, whatever it took to make my 3000. Id consider myself dirty bulking only because I don't care. I usually eat what my parents make for dinner

Work out routine:

Day 1
Chest/Core
Dumbbell presses - 60lbs
Bench - 175lbs
Decline Smith - 185lbs
Core machine -155lbs (Rotates from Side to side)
3x30 leg raises
2x100 Hanging Situps

Day 2
Legs
Squat 185lbs 10x3 &lt;-- I feel like I can do a lot more
Leg Extension Machine 90lbs 
Leg Spread Machine 290
Leg Close Machine 205
Leg Press Machine-305lbs

Day 3
Arms/Back
Shoulder Fly 22.5lbs
Preacher 27.5 6x3
Dumbbell curl 35 6x3
Back Pull Down Machine 165
Pull-ups 10x3
Chin-ups 10x3

If rep/set isn't stated it is 8x3.

As you can tell I don't have any terminology at all. I have this in my phone only to make sure I keep lifting more than I did last week, and like I said earlier the smith press with bench press.  

Hope I don't sound too much like an idiot.

1356056669.0,157ca1,Female lifter - can't handle my gym anymore,,57,35,63,"Sorry in advance for how long this is. If you read it you are a gem and I really appreciate it! I will bold the most important paragraphs for anyone who wants the TLDR version.

I posted on here under a different user name awhile back about gym etiquette. Basically I said there was a guy hitting on me and asked for advice. The consensus was that he is a turd who should leave me alone

I'm going to reiterate a few things from that post. I love going to the gym. My lifts have gone up so much in the past eight months since I started. I'm a 5'9"" female, too. I started olympic lifting with a coach last month, and he has helped me a lot in terms of form for my squats and deadlifts. He has coached me proper form in assistance exercises like bench press and military press as well. I have a close circle of friends who lift, including my boyfriend who was a powerlifter in the past. This has helped me a lot as well. So while I'm  not perfect, I certainly know what I'm doing.

Going to the gym is my time to just feel awesome, and get pumped up. I'm not a total ice queen - I don't mind talking to people briefly between sets, or exchanging a nod of acknowledgement or a hello. But for the most part I think it's rude to completely interrupt people at the gym. So unless someone initiates conversation with me I don't talk to others. I expect the same courtesy be extended to me.

Anyways, that is where I currently workout. It's a pretty crowded gym most days, and mostly guys workout in the weights area. Consequently I am very used to getting looked at. But it's usually respectful enough that people don't stare or linger around too long. 

**I usually don't ask people to spot me on the bench press, and agreed. Then he does the first thing that pisses me off - tries to tell me my form and breathing are wrong. Now look... I'm not so hardheaded that I refuse to admit I'm wrong. But I've been training for 8 months, one of which is with an olympic coach who is a 7x canadian national champion. While I've been perfecting my form for months, this dude clearly has no idea what he is doing (tried telling me to squat using a smith machine - LOL). So I said to myself ""okay just get this set over with and then he will leave"". Wrong. He took the liberty to offer his ""services"" and spot me for the next 3 sets after that. Not only that, but he stuck around and didn't go back to his workout. So I had to sit there and talk to him during my break, which I usually use to listen to music and think. Let me make something clear - even if I was single, I wouldn't be interested in him.**

**Today, thinking he is being super generous. I agreed thinking it might be different today, but he did the same old shit trying to coach my form and tell me what to do. What really pisses me off most about this is how he's formed a bunch of opinions about me without having any idea what my life is like. He assumes because I am female that I have no knowledge of lifting. He told me not to curve my back because I was going to injure it, and tried to get me to bench with my grip as wide as his, when he is taller than me and obviously my wing span is much smaller. He is just an overall bum.**

**Then I go over to do pull ups and he FOLLOWS ME OVER THERE! I had my hand across my chest changing the music on my ipod and he tapped me on the shoulder and was like ""you all right?"" I'm like ""uhh.. yeah?"" he's like ""oh you looked like you were in pain"". We exchange a few more awkward words and I get back on for my next set. After that set I was standing there and I could see him approaching out of the corner of my eye and hopped up for the next set prematurely. After that it hit me - I was changing my workout for this douche

**To top it all off

I might think differently in thirty years when I am in my fifties and no longer receive this kind of male attention, regardless of whether you know if she is single.

So... **I guess I'm asking this community which is predominantly made up of men - how do you think I should handle this?** My two main issues are 1. that this assclown thinks it's okay to interrupt my workout and hit on me and 2. that he tries to correct me while knowing nothing about me and while knowing nothing about lifting himself.

I don't want to be mean to people. But I don't know where to draw the line - like I can't see any point today when I could have intervened and gotten him to leave me alone. I ended my workout early just to get away from him. I have entertained the idea of wearing a fake wedding ring to the gym

* $42/mo for 12 months
* $39/mo for 18 months
* $36/mo for 24 months

Regardless of whether it's a gym, I don't like signing up for anything for two years.  On the other hand, we're spending a LOT of money on food every month, and savings are good.  So what to do?

First

If you wish to void your contract, that doesn't live within 25 miles of one of their clubs.  Go online to the USPS official change of address page and, for $1, change your address to your relative/friend's place.

The contract requires proof of movement, they don't issue new driver's licenses, and instead instruct you to create a ""change of address"" label and show you how to print/fill out yourself.  Slap a label on your license, bring in the receipt of your change of address form, you can now void your contract without penalty.

My only excess income that I can spend would be that from my mTurk services. (Amazon Turk) - Which only nets me $100 a month or $50 per two weeks and that's if I'm being diligent.

I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on what meals to buy for consistent intake. My biggest problem was not being able to be consistent

1. Eggs 2. Milk are on my list, Vons and Valiarta are my shops. (Dollar Tree being the nearest and cheapest). They also have canned goods, should I think of getting these every x2 weeks?

2. I have 10-20 pound dumbells, access to pull up bars, perfect push-ups. Protein shakes and energy shakes. Again, problem is consistency...

3. For GOMAD

Or if anyone can kindly link me a post or sub that can help me out. I think there was one frugalmeals? but couldn't locate it. I'm also finding out ways to try to gain extra income

Thanks very much. Hopefully this can also help out people living in such status. We need to at least look decent to continue fighting :P",,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/13dxcc/budget_gain_food_for_the_poor_100_a_month_possible/
1351914645.0,12ju1c,My Gainit Stratagems,star_pilot,31,10,10,"Quick post about what I've done as a skinny guy (borderline-underweight BMI most of my life) to gain mass. In six months I went from 120 lb to 150 lb while adopting a Starting Strength regimen, but in the six months I've learned a lot about how to eat a lot practically (not cooking constantly or carrying tupperware everywhere) and hope that some of it is useful to others.

**Will add calorie/protein amounts later**

**Starting Out**

Initially, and right after workouts you should have a voracious appetite. Don't be frustrated if you can't eat 3,500 calories on day 1. Your appetite will grow dramatically as you gain muscle.

**Recipes**

These aren't the only things I eat

Gainer Meat Slop

Silverhydra's slop is great but intended for weight loss/maintenance. The cabbage is low-calorie stomach filler (competitive eaters eat it to distend their stomachs) that a gainer could replace with more calories. My version drops the cabbage for beans and replaces the processed red meat with whole chicken.

- 2 lb chicken breasts/thighs
- 1 c dry black beans
- 2 c kale
- 2 red onions
- 2 carrots
- 2 bell peppers
- 28 oz (1 can) crushed tomatoes

Optional

- 8 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp cayenne
- ½ tbsp thyme
- ½ tbsp fresh basil
- salt

Dump in a big pot

Tim Ferriss's Tuna Chili Mac

Ferriss uses this super quick meal to pack in calories and protein: wheat macaroni + can of tuna + can of turkey chili. More details at http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/timothyf.htm ctrl/⌘-f for ""favorite meal""

Post-Workout Shake

- 1 banana
- 3 c milk
- 1 scoop protein powder (ON Gold Standard Natural Chocolate)
- ¼ c mixed frozen berries
- 1 tbsp almond butter
- 1 tsp creatine

I don't actually measure the amounts (I really use a ""pad"" of almond butter on a knife); these are estimates coming from a guy who cooks a fair amount.

My morning shakes consist of just milk, get a 28 oz BlenderBottle® (Amazon, any nutrition store); the little ball helps mix so much

Breakfast

- 1 c plain rolled oats
- 0.8 c water

Optional: mashed up banana, brown sugar, cinnamon, bit of salt

Microwave 2 minutes

**Protein Snacks**

These are protein-dense and require little preparation. Some work well for eating inconspicuously throughout the day

- Almonds, encouraging one to eat more.)
- Canned tuna
- Canned chili
- Greek yogurt
- Cottage cheese (watch out for the fat)
- Protein bars (Pure Protein chocolate peanut butter 31 g are my favorite
- Milk

On a non-workout day I'll start off with a protein shake brought in from home, which is right before I work out. These bars are pretty filling, preventing hunger pangs during my workout, but it's not so much that I cramp. 

**On Milk**

I started with whole milk, so I switched to 1% and have used mostly that. Lower-fat milk is *much* less filling than whole but contains a similar proportion of protein. Skim goes down like water almost, and if you just want protein and not fat, consider having some with every meal. Going with whole means you'll be able to drink less of it, and will shift your protein-fat intake to more fat, less protein. Keep that in mind when deciding which type of milk to drink.",,,,

I'm posting this for you guys showing that no matter how thin you are

I never thought I would be able to put on weight (or even have muscles) because of how fast my metabolism is.

My workout was a pretty basic 5x a week plan:
Monday: Chest and Triceps
Tuesday: Back and Biceps
Wednesday:  Shoulders
Thursday: Legs
Friday: Chest and arms again (an easier all-over workout than mon-tues)

As for food

  Protein Shake was ""Serious Mass"".  I didn't measure out the milk but I had a very large beer mug I would mix everything in along with 2 Tbsp. olive oil

  Just the shakes themselves 3x a day was enough calories for a day.  IIRC

   My pre-workout was Jack3D but I think that got discontinued/outlawed?  It was still available in Spain

  I was also taking daily vitamins.  I don't remember what they were called

  My daily food looked like:

Wake up at 8am - Shake, orange, and daily vitamins
10am - PBJ and another banana
Lunch- Leftovers from night before*
        - about 45 mins later a PBJ
2 pm- Chicken Fried Rice + fruit
4pm- Workout
** Right after workout, I would take another shake.**
7pm- Dinner
9/10pm - Another Shake and leftovers from dinner

I'll share my 2-month [progress] inside (109lb to 129lb and counting)",AnotherDayAlone,31,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/15esav/good_weight_for_short_people_im_56_also_when/

My goal weight used to be 140lb but I'm almost 130lb now and still seem quite skinny. I think I'm going to set my new goal at 150lb. Any fellow shorties here that can comment at which weight you started looking ""swole""?

A little about me (edit: I actually wrote a lot more than I intended and unintentionally shared my progress) before I ask my 2nd question: 

**PROGRAM**: I began the Practical Programming novice program about 2 months ago because I heard it's great for gaining strength and mass quickly. After carefully reading Starting Strength

**DIET**: I weighed only 109lb at the start so I wasn't very worried about my diet at that point. So I ate dirty

But the last 2 weeks

* veggies (sometimes cheat with v8 juice)
* eggs
* lean meats (fattiest I eat now would be lean ground beef) or fish (the fattier
* whole milk (I try not to drink more than 2 cups a day. After drinking about 6 cups a day at the start, and I just felt really unhealthy)
* cheese
* oats/cereal/brown rice (I try to eat no more than 3 cups a day ever since I read ""Wheat Belly"". Keeping my carbs low now and might even eliminate wheat completely--after I gain mass of course)
* 1-2 tbsp peanut butter (going to switch to a healthier organic version later)
* 3-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
* I plan to add almonds/cashews into my diet very soon (loads of calories

I've been averaging about 2500 calories a day on this clean diet. If my weight gain slows

**PROGRESS**: In terms of body weight

(Sorry

As for my lifts

All numbers are 3x5 unless stated otherwise.

* Squats: 160lb. I actually got to 190lb before I did a major deload because I re-aggravated a damn groin injury early on. Funny thing is just last week
* Deadlift: 1x5 220lb. Starting to get a little heavy
* Bench: 120lb
* Press: 65lb. Another lift in which the light bulb finally went on quite recently. This feels easy now when I once struggled with a lower weight.
* Barbell curls: 3x8 55lb (I added curls about a week ago
* Chin-ups: 10
* Pull-ups: 8
* Dips: 12
* Abs: Nothing yet. I see a thin layer of fat where I once could see abs so I do plan to do crunches or something. Suggestions?
* Cardio: HIIT jump rope 3 days a week on off-days

**Next Program?** My goal has always been aesthetics (so I'm probably going to set my sights on a hypertrophy program next like PHAT) but I knew I had to put on mass first.

Should I wait until I reach my goal weight AND all my lifts stall about 3x? This is the lengthiest option and not one I am keen on. I like my strength gains but remember

Should I move on when I'm near my goal weight

Something else?

If I do chicken I usually just throw it on the grill. Add this to your sausage. Add two-three tbsp olive oil and sautee your onions and jalapenos. Now follow the prep directions for the Jambalaya mix. Essentially it's just bringing 4 cups of water to a boil and then adding the mix plus your meat, cover for 25-30 minutes. Once this finishes cooking I add my brown rice and mix everything together. You can season to your taste after adding the brown rice.

Hey guys! I thought I'd post the modest progress I made before my injury. At the end of last month I broke my arm arm wrestling of all things. I won the first round with my right hand but wasn't as successful with my left. The twisting motion caused [a complex fracture in my left humerus](http://i.imgur.com/hLJVmN8.jpg), nine bolts and twenty three staples](http://i.imgur.com/9E6TB7D.jpg) to patch me up, and now, two weeks later, I'm well on my way to making a full recovery. Thankfully I'm a natural righty so besides having to learn how to put in contact lenses one-handed, I haven't had much difficulty coping with the temporary loss of a limb in my everyday life.

While I was in the hospital I lost around 5kg and I've already noticed a significant decrease in the size of my upper body. I've gone to the gym a few times to commit murder on my legs/abs but doing bodyweight squats and incline situps just isn't the same. I'm a shadow of my former self without a barbell in my life. The doctor says it'll be another couple months before I can step into the squat rack again


Edit: Sorry if the stats seem a bit wonky. For clarification, dead is high because I was using straps. Again, all of these are my best 3 sets of 5 reps, not 1RM.

I have not been taking supplements yet although I will be starting on whey protein within the next couple of weeks and possibly creatine (thoughts on that?) also was looking at Dianabol but could do with some advice and help with that too.

I eat pretty clean - Cut out the crap: no fizzy drinks

Things I eat: lots of milk - chocolate milk is great, bacon, sausage etc. Dinner is usually chicken or fish based but will mix it up with friend eggs on tuna pasta just for the extra protein. I dont track my diet too much i just eat everything as it comes and THINK about what I eat before it goes in my mouth :p

1346804952.0,zd6e4,A plan for getting into GOMAD.,RedCanary,24,4,8,"Before anyone who says the typical ""GOMAD is the devil"" or so on. There are plenty of other diet plans out their for everyone and I wouldn't typically recommend GOMAD people who are looking to bulk without fat.

However

I first tried GOMAD 2 years ago for about a month. It worked well. I put on about 5 kg (11lb) and I definitely looked bigger. [Since then I've cut a bit due to high cardio sports - been happy with the physique but looking to bulk again.]

When I first started what I first noticed was the bloating

Since then I've tried GOMAD a couple times and couldn't get through a week. I felt incredibly sick and couldn't stand the taste of milk without wanting to vomit and then proceed with evacuating my bowels.

About a month ago

At moment I'm just about getting a gallon in



My plan has been as follows:

Week 1: 1 L (1/4 Gallon) of milk + 1 L of coconut/almond/oat milk

Week 2: 1.5 (or 2) L of milk + 1.5 L of coconut/almond/oat almond/oat milk

Week 3: 2 (or 3) L of milk + 1 L coconut/almond/oat milk

Week 4 and onwards: 4 L (1 Gallon) of milk



The idea is to slowly accustom your stomach to the lactose *and* to get your body used to consuming so much liquid. It will take a bit longer but you'll feel less like (and need to do less) shit.

The reason for coconut/almond/oat milk? It has the general consistency of milk and has a decent amount of calories.

Obviously

Now this may be a bit indelicate:
My dejection was very light in color on the first 2-3 days and mostly I had diarrhea. I drank 3-4L liter milk those days.

Now my first question: Is it possible

My second question may be already answered a couple of times
Should I already start lifting? I'm really skinny and I don't think that I can gain muscle with the amount of ""fat"" I got

My goal is to reach 185 lbs, this will be a long run, though I want to work hard for it to reach it someday.
However: Is it possible to gain 20 lbs in a month for me? I know, is there any number I can surely surpass, if I'm strictly holding onto my new diet?

no tl;dr

1360438974.0,187fqp,[Help] How does my program look?,-AKR-,20,2,16,"Hello fellow Redditors



I present to you


I'm looking for some feedback on my training program


First off,5 kg (180 lb). I'm studying and I have gym on campus, and I got time to train pretty much every day. My goal, as of now, is to gain mass. I'm not going to that huge size, but more aesthetics. But that won't be necessary to worry about for some years :D


I went to the gym for 2 months last summer on a 5x5 fullbody program

As of 2nd january, proving to myself that time for gym is something you take, not something you get. So I'm quite new to all this bodybuilding stuff, but I have been lurking on reddit since late december, gathering a lot of good information and watching a lot of Kai videos ;)


I were at 77, so that might have increased my waterweight. [This picture](http://imgur.com/QX2gwn2.jpg) shows my progress.


The program is a slight modification of [Dough's Mass Building Routine for Ectomorphs](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/dougs-mass-building-routine-for-ectomorphs.html)


	

The program:

Day 1

|Close Grip Bench Press | 4 | 8-10 | 30 kg / 66 lb |
|Skull Crushser | 2 | 8-10 | 22.5 kg / 50 lb |
|Dips (with assist as of now) | 2 | 8-10 | 5 kg / 11 lb assist |



Day 2

| Exercise   | Sets         |     Reps     |Approx. weight |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Bent Over Dumbbell Rows | 4 | 8-10 | 24 kg / 53 lb |
| Pulldowns | 4 | 10-12 | 51 kg / 112.5 lb |
| Cable Reverse Grip Rows | 4 | 8-10 | 20.5 kg / 45 lb |
| Standing Barbell Curl | 4 | 6-8 | 25 kg / 55 lb |
| Alternate Seated Dumbbell Curl | 2 | 8-10 | 9 kg / 20 lb|
| Concentration Curl | 2 | 8-10 | 8 kg / 17 lb |



Day 3

| Exercise   | Sets         |     Reps     |Approx. weight |

| 45 Degree Leg Press | 3 | 6-8 | 180 kg / 400 lb |
| Hack Squat | 3 | 8-10 | 50 kg / 110 lb |

| Leg Curl | 3 | 8-10 | 15.8 kg / 35 lb |



Day 4

| Exercise   | Sets         |     Reps     |Approx. weight |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Seated Dumbbell Press | 3 | 8-10 | 18.5 kg / 40 lb |
| Seated Barbell Press | 3 | 8-10 | 25 kg / 55 lb|
| Dumbbell Lateral Raise | 3 | 10-12 | 5-6 kg / 11-13 lb |

| Standing Calf Raise | 3 | 12-15 | 52 kg / 115 lb |
| Seated Calf Raise | 3 | 6-8 | 35 kg / 77 lb|



I'm trying to stay in the upper bound on reps, but I'm doing good ;)



The diet:

If you take a look at the [picture](http://imgur.com/QX2gwn2.jpg) of my weight progress, which shows [this](http://i.imgur.com/DV7mYjN.jpg). I'm aware of the fact that these gadgets can't be trusted on the actual bf%.

I have tried to calculate my BMR

I have very little appetite

I'm using MyFitnessPal to track everything, and 25% fat. This results in 188 g protein, 83 g fat, and 240 g carbs.





My questions to you guys:



- What's you 2 cents ?



- Should I go with a fullbody or 2-split as I see suggested for most starters? or should I maybe follow this program without a single offday (day 1, day 4, day 1....)?


- The program I'm using suggest abs training on day 1+3 or 2+4. I'm not sure what to train there

Though I have noticed gains on my legs, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the most effective types of squats (or any strength building leg workouts) with free weights? When I look at some of the progress numbers you guys talk about (in regards to squats), it's a little discouraging knowing that I can't hit those numbers specifically because I don't have a squat machine, and am stuck on free weights. Any advice would be really appreciated.

I also wanted to get your take on your rest days in regards to eating. Do any of you change your eating habits at all?

I thought I should do something about it back in feb, when I had some time and money. For the 2 years before I started lifting weights I had done virtually no exercise. 

So on the first day of the summer, which was mostly machines in the first month to build a bit of strength, I didn't touch legs (Newbie gains of around 18-19lbs that month!).

For the past three months, assisted pull ups, and a few others which I honestly don't know the name for, I only use machines when the free weight area is too busy. I tried to focus on compound exercises, so I haven't really done anything for abs.

Diet: Although I always thought I ate a lot, ham and cheese. I would make myself an afternoon sandwich, and then I would have a massive dinner to top it off. I also had a protein shake every day which had Greek yogurt  and whole milk in it.

My plan is to bulk to 210

Deadlift (I suck at deadlifts): 185 to 275

My diet is literally as many calories as I can, cottage cheese, avacadoes, sweet potatoes, peanut butter, and of course, oats.

So for the past month I have been feeling incredibly drained of energy. I had been sick with fever and I never really recovered. Exercising was becoming a fucking pain every time and I couldn't see myself make any progress at all anymore. Actually I was getting weaker. This week I got very sick again. I thought it was because I had just started in a new job and I had been working around the clock + had a few exams.  

So after visiting the doctor it seems I have mononucleosis. Thats what sharing a bottle of jägermeister with 12 other people does for you. Stupid


Now I won't be able to do ANY exercise for atleast 3 months according to my doctor. I can't even walk up the stairs without being out of breath. I could feel the side-effects for up to a year too. Fucking great.   


Now I am afraid of that I'll lose all my gains and muscles. Any ideas what to do? Anyone else whos had mononucleosis here on /r/gainit? My friend who had mononucleosis lost 10kgs in just a few weeks! Good god I don't wanna lose all that progress.

I'm 6'2"" tall and used to be (7 months ago) 250 pounds. I'm not really sure how much muscle I had but I was definitely fat. I tried the keto diet to see if it worked (didn't seem all that bad of a diet). Fast forward to present day. I'm now at 160 pounds and ""look like a skeleton"" according to my dad. He told me this and I think it holds true

Anyway, but I've become accustomed to eating my schools eggs and bacon every morning. Also, my schools cafeteria is buffet style and I have unlimited access to it. I can go in any time between 7am-11pm. Also another. Carb related question, should I try to eat them more towards after my workout and only on workout days? Or does it not matter that much?  As for exercises  I've  just been doing some dumbbell exercises as I'm trying to build up what little muscle I have left before attempting 5x5 or one of those programs. 

Another question:  it seams most of u guys have been skinny most of your lives and this able to eat ALL the things. Will this effect me differently since I used to be fat?

I just wanted to make my first post here and share some of my noob experiences and maybe get some advice. I would like to go from 5'8"" 105 lbs. to 130 and then see how that feels and adjust necessarily.

Over the last month I've tried to ease myself into gaining. I downloaded myFitnesspal and have been halfway using it. I'm just starting to get my feet wet.  I love the app and can find most the things I eat/cook.  I just need to be more consistent.  
Would a 3000-3500 calorie diet work well as a starting goal and perhaps increase from there?

My goals have been to eat some oatmeal made with milk and add 2 TBLsp of peanut butter and some honey every morning.(I am a terrible morning eater) If not the oatmeal than at least 16. oz of milk with Whole wheat toast and butter or peanut butter or nutella. Another favorite is yogurt walnuts and honey. Any other high calorie breakfast ideas?

I've also been trying to increase the tolerance I have for milk. My problem is that my digestive tract has been a little uneasy trying to figure out whats going on.
I've gone from no milk in almost a decade to try to drink a third a gallon a day. The most I've had in one day was a whole half gallon. Is it relevant that I add a little bit of Strawberry flavoring (nesqwik type) to make it taste better?

Sometimes my stool is hard and thin

Anybody have a recommended dosage of fiber for someone looking to start on GOMAD?  A calorie goal? and finally tips on exercises that makes you hungry. I've been a basketball player but that doesn't work this time of year. 10 dollar memberships at the gym though I think it may be worth it to get on a treadmill.

What I've found is that getting into the habit of eating things consistently will increase your appetite. Start small

What I've done is I've started with eggs. Before

First, add a hefty amount of pepper sauce (I like it spicy), and add a pinch of salt for a little flavor. Then, I fry it up real nice in a pan and make a basic omelette.

By simply getting into the **habit** of eating egg EVERY DAY, I could hardly finish one egg. Now, I eat two eggs in the morning, and two in the evening. I plan to increase that number as well.

**Here's what you need:** 

 - Two pounds stew meat

You can find this with the meat and it's literally called ""stew meat."" 

- Four onions

- Six Bigass carrots. 

- Two or three pounds potato

- Two cans canned tomatoes or tomato soup

- Beans. 

Whatever you find in the cupboard. Kidney, two, three cans-- you decide! I put these in for cheap extra calories and protein. 

**Preparation:** 

- Brown your beef. I just do it in the bottom of my bigass pot. 

- Saute your onions in a frying pan. Get em nice and brown

- Cut up the rest of your veggies and throw them in too. 

**Cooking:**

This shit's important, but it shouldn't look like Mt. Doom post-ring.

This shit isn't hard. Go forth and make your gains. Extra gainz may be wrought by freezing portions of this to eat later in the week.

1364575912.0,1b90wq,"[Results] Smolov squats through Base Mesocycle. Gained 5 pounds in 4 weeks, took my squat from 330-360.",gocougs11,20,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1b90wq/results_smolov_squats_through_base_mesocycle/, and I had a 445lb pull at that point. When I got my bench to 265 and realized I was benching what I was squatting

I did a 20 rep squat program, and took my squat 1RM from 265-330 (linear gains are awesome). I was a little disappointed that I could get 315x3 at that point, but could only get 330x1. I attribute it to the fact that coming off of the 20 rep program, my body was very used to doing high repetition work and not the maximal effort for 1 rep.

I took about 3 weeks of a break, because I felt my body was ready for high volume squatting, since I had recently done the 20 rep program. I used 315 as a 'training max' to calculate weights for the base mesocycle, to make sure I wouldn't miss any reps.

**Smolov training plan**

[Here is a google docs link to the spreadsheet which outlines the program.](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx-ZEX9Q2F_ESUFxQVhtOWVPVm8/edit?usp=sharing)

Smolov is a 12 week program, which I just completed. Now i'm moving into a 2 week 'switching' cycle, and finally is a 4 week long 'intense mesocycle'. Many people consider smolov to be one of the most difficult squat programs out there. It is generally said that you should NOT attempt this program if you cannot already squat over 300lb. I wouldn't disagree. During the base mesocycle, you're squatting every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. The first week, Friday is 7x5 at 80%

The second week, etc. On the third week, you add another 10 lb. For me, this meant that my last 10x3 day was 10 sets of 3 at 300lb, which was 95% of the training 1RM I was using for this cycle.

At the end of 3 weeks of this, and so whenever I squat I have to pay a ton of attention to proper elbow and shoulder position. On my last 10x3 day, my shoulder felt like it was going to fall off after my 5th set, but I got through 5 more. It is important to note that Smolov is about the reps, not the rest. Take as much rest as you need to. If it takes you 2 hours to get through 10 sets, so be it. I think my longest day squatting was 55 minutes for 10 sets.

I was icing my shoulder immediately after squatting every day, and leave without doing any accessory work. Other days I would bench and do some upper back accessory work, and always a bit of dynamic shoulder stretching. After resting it for 6 days it feels great, and squatting today gave me no pain at all.

After those three weeks, and get in the gym to hit any muscle group other than your (lower) back or your legs. Then you test a new 1RM. I just left the gym, I weighed in at 178 and my best squat was at 360lb. So, I gained 5 pounds and added 30lb to my squat 1RM, in 4 weeks. Going into the next phase of the program, the intense mesocycle, I intend to use 350lb as my training max

The intense mesocycle basically has me squatting 3 days a week, and Saturday, and again, it is high volume and training within 85%-95% of your 1RM.

**Diet**

My diet during this was pretty simple. I'm trying to keep my bulk fairly clean, about 700 kcal breakfast around 8am.

I lift around 11am, pork, or steak, and carrots or broccoli, with some rice and gravy, and a glass of whole milk which is all usually about 800kcal.

I keep a huge bag of trailmix in my desk at work that I snack on throughout the day. I'd say on the average day I get at least 1000 kcal from trail mix while at work.

For dinner, and snack on that after dinner until I go to bed. I also drink probably 1/2 - 3/4 of a gallon of milk a day while at home, just to make sure I'm well over my 3500 kcal/day goal.

* One Armed Chinup progression (cur: Uneven Chinups)
* Handstand Pushup progr. (cur: using a math book [roughly 5cm

I'm currently considering adding the pushup progression or a planch progression back in and might look for a gym after new year in order to add some leg work (which is not easily done using only bodyweight).
Some time after new year though in order to avoid the masses. I'm not in a hurry. ;-)

Sex: **Male**
Age: **18**(Turned October 26th)
Bodyfat %: ~10%

**My goals:**
Muscle gains

Disorders: **No disorders**

**Non-smoker**

**Nutrition:**

4-5 meals a day that consist with plenty of protein

*In-depth:*
Somewhat healthy, this includes pizza/mcdonalds/etc.

My favorite/most common meals is 5-7 fried egg whites with fried potatoes

I usually eat breakfast consisting of 3-5 egg whites and 2 pieces of white toast topped of with 2 large glasses of milk(Recently

I take 3-5g creatine about 1 hour after a workout.

**Exercise:**
For the last 13/14 weeks  have been working out 4-5 times a week

For the first month I did about moderately strenuous cardio for 30mins(warm up included) every workout but have stopped recently because I've heard/read almost everywhere that it eats muscle.

**My split** (with 2 days of rest somewhere in between):
1.Legs/lower back
2.Bicep/lats
3.Chest/shoulders/Triceps
4.Abs/Obliques/Calves

Sorry for the wall of text and any and all advice is appreciated!

P.S. Would performing full body workouts benefit me more instead of my 4-day split?

Here's the recipe:

2 cups whole milk (500 ml)
2 scoops whey protein (I use Optimum Nutrition Oats and Whey chocolate but im sure anything else does the same job)
1 tbsp coconut oil
2 tbsp peanut butter/nutella
one egg
Add ice for desired texture/consistency

Bugger it. I used to say I was a high metabolism kind of guy. I used to say I could never gain weight no matter what I ate. I used to think I had good posture.

All that was horseshit.

1. Eating 3000 k/cal per day is hard fucking work. Now I finally understand exactly how much I should have been eating all along. And low and behold

2. I don't really have a huge belly. I DO have some pretty severe Anterior Pelvic Tilt. It's exacerbated how big my stomach looks and been the root cause of all the lower back tension I've always felt. 
I'm going to start working on my APT this week (just ordered a foam roller) and I'm pretty terrified of how much more work it's going to take. But it has to be done. My stomach has bothered me for years and it's really strange that I never bothered to look in the mirror and notice the awful curve in my lower back. I can't wait to look in the mirror and see the APT gone.

I just finished week 4 of SS. Progress has been slow because I've been working my diet up at a slower pace:

Squat - 45 lbs moved to 75 lbs

Bench Press - 45 lbs moved to 75 lbs

Full Press - 45 lbs moves to 55 lbs (sadtrombone.com)

DL - 65 lbs moved to 110 lbs

Along with SS I do Ab Chairs (3 x 14)

In general my body is looking leaner and my pecs+arms are looking nicer already. I'm planning to start taking Creatine next week once I'm confident of reaching 3000 cal/day (I'm still seeing a day or two where I can't quite get there.)

I've managed to gain from 98 to 102 over the past five weeks *during* a flare of my disease, too). I've bumped from 20 to 35 lbs kettlebells, and am completely freaking out my neighbors by going into iron-slinging beast mode.

 However

* No dairy
* No eggs (not UC related
* Low insoluble fiber (I can handle lentils &amp; oats reasonably)
* Low nuts (I can tolerate a small amount of nut butter)
* Low glycemic index (ie no potatos
* *Not too much meat* - this is what's killing me

Not being able to rely on the brown rice/whole chicken combo is really making it hard to find things - and enough things - to eat. As my flare gets going, soft tofu, cooked-to-death vegetables through a strainer (ie baby food), and as much lentil &amp; oat as my body will let me handle.

 Started at about 145lbs and I'm currently weighing 180 pounds at height of 6'3.  My chest day starts with 3 warmup bench sets and then a 3x5 at 145. Then in no particular order I do cable flies 3x8, I switch those up.

So really what I'm wondering is if someone can explain how my bench can go up by 55 pounds but my chest looks very much similar to when I started lifting. Writing this on a laptop so I can't post any before pictures as I have none on it until tomorrow for a comparison.

I made a conscious decision to put on some weight a few months ago and have succeeded to an extent.  I'm a 5'9"" male and have gone from under 125 to 145ish.  I was lifting weights for maybe the latter half of this period (also gained the most weight during this time).

I noticed, it's quite squishy and I can grab a hand full of it.  I'm worried now if continuing to try and eat more is a good idea if it seems to be just making me fatter, or if this is just a phase while gaining weight and due to not working out the whole time I have been eating more.  I do have concerns with other men in my family line being really skinny while younger and then getting pot bellies later on in life, but I would hope the weight lifting (and not being quite at the old age yet) would avoid that.  I still look and feel underweight everywhere else but my stomach (and to be fair, my stomach isn't really some massive entity in itself).

Some notes:
I haven't been restrictive about my diet at all
I'm sore on most days from lifting weights 3 times a week, but maybe my diet isn't well suited for that.
I don't do any cardio.  Other than lifting weights I have a pretty minimal amount of phsyical activity in my days.

Really I'm looking for some guidance/advice/insight/related experience.  Should I focus down on a diet?  Add cardio to my routine?  Do nothing because the problem will fix itself?  Something else?

I've lifted off and on since I was 16 with no real direction. I wrestled in high school and lifted then (in addition to my practices), then got out of it as school got tougher. Near the end of my senior year, I was swimming 1250m a day in the morning to prepare for lifeguarding in the summer, and lifting a standard split in the evening.   

I decided I wanted to get serious about gaining after passing my swim test, about 12% bf. I ate tons of calories (typically 4500-5000), ate clean, and did a standard split with a pyramid rep scheme (each set increase weight and decrease reps: 10-8-6). I later moved to a more hypertrophy routine with 3-4 sets of 8 reps, some of my other lifts I go lower with higher weight. I didn't use GOMAD or anything like that,  a weight gainer powder (Russian Bear 5000) helped immensely, and I always used whey isolate and creatine. I also started using a pre-workout (which I'm weaning myself off of now, a test booster (MusclePharm Battle Fuel and D-Aspartic Acid), etc. I've heard omega-6 and -9 aren't as necessary

I am now 175 lbs and about 14% bf, but the gains have slowed after the initial growth spurt caused by just starting to lift regularly. Some random strength stats (that I can remember):  

* Bench - 165x10, I focused on incline DB presses because they are more efficient, but I have way too much fun doing flat bench so I added it in)  
* Squat - 215x6 to 285x6 (I still pyramid these
* Deadlift - 135x10x3 to 225x8x3 -&gt; I never really did these before recently so most of this has been from form increases.  
  
What are you stats, and more? I'd love to hear everyone's approaches. Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all technique, and what may work for you may not work for others. Learn to listen to your body, this is the greatest lesson of lifting.

The new school year is fast approaching - for some of you it may even be your first semester in school - but you don't really know how you can keep your diet where it needs to be while living the college lifestyle. With fried chicken and hamburgers at the dining hall, anyway)

Luckily for you, low calorie, guilt-free, gluten-free, salads - whatever you think is healthy is probably keeping you from making the kind of improvements you want. To get big and put on muscle, you really only need two things in your diet:

High calories

High protein

You can FORGET about the rest. Fat, forget about it. It doesn't matter. All your body needs to gain muscle is 1. a ""calorie surplus"" and 2. a huge surplus of protein. Having a calorie surplus just means that you're eating more energy-producing food than you're using up during the day, and you just need to have lots of protein to make sure your muscle can grow.

High calories is going to mean about 3000 or more a day. High protein means more than about 120 grams a day. Here are a few tips for EASILY getting enough of both:

-Drink milk instead of water. Whole milk has about 150 calories a cup

-Snack throughout the day on junk food (you read it right). I was always a big fan of twizzlers (about 50 calories each

-Eat meat at every meal. A hamburger for lunch and fried chicken for dinner are easily gonna give you 50-60 g of protein.

-Buy protein powder, preworkouts and other fancy supplements are not gonna help. A cheap whey powder (news flash - they're all the same) will give you about 200 extra calories and 30 or so grams of protein, taken just once a day.

If you do those four things, and put on weight. My freshman year, I literally lived for a MONTH off of four foods - twizzlers, pop tarts, milk and protein powder - all while making steady gains in muscle without too much fat.

Did Starting Strength from January 8th until June 21st. That's around 5 months.

My lifts: all in 3x5

* Squat - 85-215 

* Deadlift - 95-225(Had a back injury and only recently got back to it except this time using sumo stance and holy shit. I feel like I'm going to get at least 3 plates before I stall. 225 was incredibly easy for me last time)

* Bench Press - 85-155 

* OHP - 65-110

* Power clean - 45-145

* Chin ups - 5-12 this one is total number

[Here](http://oi43.tinypic.com/vnngoh.jpg) is an accurate comparison. Sorry for bad lighting in the first one. Should have known.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/7amA1s2.jpg) is me flexed. Not incredible

My diet was just eat as much as possible with a minimum of 3000 calories a day. I did this most days.

EDIT:  Diet
Morning:  I'll eat Protein waffles (Made with whey) - You can ask for recipe if you'd like but it's about 24g of protein.  I do add light syrup and strawberries and raspberries.  I'll also have a fiber one bar.  I just drink water.  Also I take one Opti-Men Multivitamin tablet as well as my Biotin tablet (which is just for skin, I'll just eat the Special K Protein cereal which has 10g per serving.  And I'm usually eating like 2-3 servings.

MidDay: I'll eat something like lean ground beef, white rice with egg mixed and very light soy sauce, brown rice, 

Night:  I'll eat some steak with eggs sometimes.  Or I'll eat some lasagna, but it's kind of a lighter meal because I usually eat it right before I hit the gym (Yes I hit the gym at night a lot because it's when I have time.  And I still get 8 hours of rest)

Snacks throughout the day:  Fiber One Bars, Banana split with greek yogurt instead of ice cream along with almonds or any nuts I have at the time, Strawberries, Bananas, 

I also take Gold Standard Whey Protein and Dynatize Elite Casein.

If I workout in the morning

If I workout in the evening

Both servings are 24g each.  The casein also allows me to wake up with half-full feeling and not each junk food
which I am always tempted to eat.

EDIT: Here's more pics of my arms to see progress (sorry I don't have any before pics of them): http://imgur.com/a/b2I3U

My diet at first was whatever protein I could get my hands on- fast food burgers, primarily. Lots of milk too. Additionally, 2 scoops of protein (52g) and 16 ounces of milk after every work out. Because I initially put on some fat with my beginner gains, I've now been trying to watch what I eat and not have too much of a calorie surplus.

As for my routine, Shoulders, Legs. I generally spend around an hour everyday in the gym doing 4 or 5 different exercises for the daily muscle group as follows.

Chest/Tri: 5x5 Bench, Tricep Pull Downs, Skullcrushers/Inner Grip Bench superset.

Back/Bi: Standing dumbbell curls, Seated Rows, Pullups, Standing bicep cable curls.

Shoulders: I'm not really sure what to call the exercise but I can describe it: Seated with dumbbells in each hand, swing arms out so that hands are on either side of torso (kind of like raising the roof), lift weights above head, bring them back down and reset hands to starting position. Repeat 8 times.

Deltoid flies

Legs: Squats 5x5, Curls, Extensions.

All of this is coupled with at least one mile of running on the treadmill at the end (and a 10 minute warmup on the bike before the start of the workout). Additionally

So, you can do it, too!

Then starting in June I want to start a clean bulk up to the weight of 185 pounds. The next step of the plan is to cut using leangains if Im not happy with my body fat after Ive finished my bulk. I mostly want to use leangains for cutting because Ive gotten tired of eating a traditional deficit for over a year and I feel like that would switch it up a bit. The program Ive picked out for the start of my bulk is Jim Stoppani's Shortcut To Size because it seems like a great mix of hypertrophy and strength.

**Diet**

Most days begin with Serious Mass + Whole Milk + Coconut n chocolate Peanut butter = 1800 + calories. 74 or more grams of Protein. I've noticed I get tachycardia and it's pretty a fucked feeling.
So if someone has a theory let me know.

After the shake I usually don't eat much til after the Gym. Its usually anything I can get. Sometimes Chicken Stir fry. Ham Sandwich, avocado, colby jack and honey mustard and mayo on white bread. Yeah I said white bread. 

Lets also be clear just as often I dont feel like putting up with that crazy heart rate shit and I dont have my shake or eat much. I mean not really. I'll have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich zone out on some video games and then snag some cookies or some veggie chips. Maybe before bed make a turkey sandwich with spinach. That is just depending how I feel in the morning. Sometimes I just dont wanna start my morning like I took a hit of meth.

In conclusion I like to have around 2600 calories a day when I can manage and cleanly as possible. I mourn every empty delicious calorie I eat

**Lifting**

I started what I would call serious lifting in May 2012.
Of course I started with SS. I never read SS like I was suppose too. As a result I was mediocre^probably still am.

I took two things away from SS a consistency I never had for the gym or fitness and squats. I went looking for a new program cause I thought I was hot shit. I found GSLP online free somewhere read it thought it was cool bought a Villain t-shirt from their merch but I never did the fucking program. I took one look at the neck harness shit and I was like that's gay. 
All in all I ended up downloading 5/3/1 and other programs from some place or other but never implementing them. 

Currently this is what I do.

BW Pullups

L-sit Pullups

Max weighted Pull ups and Neutral grip on occasion.

BW Dips &amp; Max Weighted Dips on Occasion.

Squats and Leg Press 1-3 times a week

Bench 1-3 times a week

DeadLift Once a week never more

OHP 1-2 a week maybe

I was 145 for probably 6 years. I was so surprised to see gains... I was stuck in the mindset that I'd be stuck at 145. I definitely feel thicker

I'm keeping it simple-- lots and lots of milk, yams, and noodles. Working out Monday / Wednesday / Friday, alternating squat/bench with a couple other exercises on one day with deadlifts and a couple others on the next.

My biggest tip would be to make a killer shake. Mine is usually my lunch and it's usually about 1.5 liters made with whole milk, greek yogurt, strawberries, bananas (2), oatmeal, olive oil (4 tbsp), flax seeds

I'm moving into leaner things including cardio and I've now cut the oil from my shakes. Looking to gain the rest in muscle weight
