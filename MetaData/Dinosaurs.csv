The first Dinosaur Family of the Week is now up and running!  We're doing [Vulcanodontidae.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dinosaurs/comments/scixz/the_first_ever_dinosaur_family_of_the_week_april/)  
Everyone have fun!

**/edit**


I really like r/Dinosaurs

I would like to propose that we brush up on various dinosaurs in a fun way

What would you say to having a ""Family of the Week"", they should submit it even if it's an unrelated dinosaur!).  

Example:  
[The Family of the Week is: Spinosauridae!](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Spinosauridscale.png)

And then submissions following it that week could look like:  

* [OMG is that a fish?!](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/173/8/8/baryonyx_walkeri_by_great_oharu-d3jnu6a.jpg)  

* [Nice detail of a Baryonyx Walkeri's head](http://www.dinosaur-world.com/weird_dinosaurs/species/baryonyx_walkeri.gif)

* [Do you find me... Irritating?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritator_challengeri)  

* [Oh man

* [Pretty battle-worn Spinosaurus...](http://i.imgur.com/tll6s.jpg)

And so on!  

Hah

So

I've *always* loved dinosaurs. As a child

So I propose that to help make one of my most loved childhood subjects (loved even to this day) popular, to make the interested dinomaniacs curious for more.

Should we make this subreddit scheme a lot more snazzy? How about an 'earthy' background with dinosaur fossils burried like how the Minecraft forum is (look behind/over the borders) http://www.minecraftforum.net/
With people digging down the way at the top/subreddit bar?

Oh gosh.. **DINOSAUR FLAIRS!**!

SO, you want to be ""Team Ankylosaurus."" OK, cool, that's a decent dinosaur, sure. However, there's no pic for that. If you want a pic, you can edit the css class next to your flair (if you can find that area) and type in the name of a default. Example: You could be flair: Team Ankylosaurus with css class: pterodactyl. OK?

History: There was moderator discussion of doing this a while back (a year ago?)

Then, and provided a little help to get the ball rolling. [link to post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dinosaurs/comments/1e3tog/im_thinking_we_could_improve_the_flair/)

You  might need to re-pick your flair to activate pictures

    parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurus, triceratops, stegosaurus, 

    pterodactyl, therizinosaurus

Oh, I added therizinosaurus as a default team with a picture. Win.

Would you buy a shirt like this? What do you think of the colors and design placement? Any suggestions for how to make it more awesome? (because obviously it is a dinosaur and has a baseline awesomeness)
