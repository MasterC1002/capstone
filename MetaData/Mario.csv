We need to consider the fact that Baby Bowser has another parent.

Thinking about it logically
A) Peach. Bowser spends a lot of time with Peach. Baby Bowser thinks Peach is his mommy

B) Yoshi
Bowser is a big turtle thing. Yoshi is a fruity dinosaur. They're both green. Baby Bowser shares some of these traits. He is green, Baby Bowser's voice is also just as annoying as Yoshi's.

C) One of the million Koopas
Kings have kids with their subjects all the time. They don't want them

Other teachers who did this usually called their quizzes by names like ""Green/Yellow/Red"" to signify that, or your second try (yellow), or, if necessary, a final attempt (red).

Any ideas for translating that into a Mario theme? I was thinking maybe 3UP, or maybe just three names of common Mario enemies (Goomba / Koopa / Piranha Plant). Wanted to see if you guys had any better ideas!!

We are a gaming marathon group called Play 2 Raise.  On on April 26th, depending on how many donations we receive.  You can find a lot more info on our website as to which games we are playing and some of our goals.

What we are looking for is some Mario paraphernalia you might have that you would be willing to donate to us to raffle off to a donor.  This may be a long shot

If you have any questions or concerns

You can read more about Child's Play Charity at http://www.childsplaycharity.org/about

My best memory was when I finally beat the final boss.(spoiler-y, and her head took just two or three attacks. Then her heart opened up and I went to town. I had to kill the arms/head one more time, and on the second time she exposed her heart, she was dead. I felt amazing and that ending was really satisfying as an 8 year old.
