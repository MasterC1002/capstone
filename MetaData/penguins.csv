I'm not one to get too worked up about rock star antics

The guy's record is pretty disgusting: convicted of possessing child pornography in the UK, and most recently arrested again in the UK for child molestation as part of the BBC sex scandal. Put simply, the guy's the lowest form of scumbag.

Why does this matter to a Pens fan? Because last season

Most other professional sports leagues have dropped the song (the NFL allows for a cover version

Do we go back to Blur's Song #2 (the Woohoo song) or find something new (anything but 7 Nation Army)? I don't really care. I just don't want to cheer for a pedophile.

What do you think?

TL/DR: The Pens goal song (Rock &amp; Roll #2) is written and performed by a pedophile. We can do better.

The second thing is about tomorrow's game thread, but please, please, please! just try and stay calm and not antagonize in anyway.  Let's be the bigger men/women.  Don't talk about fandom-based downvoting, or get upset when someone calls Crosby Cindy for the millionth time....it's not going to accomplish anything, and if nothing is said from our end, it's less fodder for them.  It's frustrating, but let's just try and enjoy the game.

So he told me when they won Games 6 and 7, but I decided not to tell the Detroit Fan.  I let him run his mouth for the entire 10 days we were out there.  Finally we pack up and go back to the rear, and as we are getting off the bus he says, ""Well I'm going to go watch the highlights of the Red Wings hoisting the cup again.""

**Big Story:**  

&gt; It's win or go home for the New York Islanders, will try to close out their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal and beat the Islanders in a playoff series for the first time in their history. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Pittsburgh opted not to practice Friday

&gt; All he's done in the next four games is score three goals and add five assists to bring the Penguins within one victory of a second-round series against the Ottawa Senators. But to do so

&gt; ""This is always the toughest one










**Islanders:**

&gt; New York has its own Hart Trophy finalist

&gt; ""I always look at what that player does for your team

&gt; Tavares said the Islanders' first trip to the playoffs since 2007 and their better-than-expected performance against the top-seeded Penguins is a group effort.

&gt; ""Obviously we're in this battle right now, or five or six guys pulling their weight,"" he told the media Friday. ""We had contributions from everybody down the stretch to get ourselves in the playoffs and now be in this position. Everybody has contributed in a big way.""

**Big Story:**  

&gt; After dropping Game 1 on Saturday night, in a 3-0 loss to the Boston Bruins in Game 1 of this Eastern Conference Final at Consol Energy Center. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Pittsburgh breathed a sigh of relief Sunday when it learned that winger Matt Cooke’s services will be available for Game 2.

&gt; Cooke was handed a five-minute major for checking Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid from behind and a game misconduct

&gt; ""I chipped the puck in early just after the red line, and he looks me right in the eyes. I think at the last minute he goes to make a reverse with the puck, but I've committed to hit him. I don't drive him through the boards. I make contact. I think it's a penalty, but I don't think it's an ejection or a suspension. That's my opinion.""















**Bruins:**

&gt; Tuukka Rask has somewhat flown under the radar this postseason

&gt; Rask was helped by center David Krejci’s pair of goals and a defense that held the high-powered Penguins to just seven shots on goal in the third period.

&gt; ""Tuukka stood tall and made a lot of saves at the right time














From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030312&amp;navid=sb:preview      )

### Injury Report:

&gt; Bruins defenseman Wade Redden (upper body) did not dress for Game 1. He missed the entire conference semifinal series against the New York Rangers. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Krejci now has seven goals this postseason and leads the League with 19 points. He has 45 points in his past 45 playoff games

**Big Story:** 

&gt; The Pittsburgh Penguins didn't have Sidney Crosby in the lineup for Game 1 of their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series against the New York Islanders -- but they didn't miss him. The Penguins completely outplayed the Islanders in a 5-0 victory and will try to take a two-game lead in the best-of-7 series before it shifts to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum for games Sunday and Tuesday. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; The stat sheet said the Islanders outhit the Penguins 41-36 in the opener
Forward Brenden Morrow wants that to continue in Game 2.

&gt; ""If we can slow them down by playing physical against them, then I think that's kind of what our focus is with a lot of their players,"" he said after Thursday's practice.







**Islanders:**

&gt; The only positive the Islanders can take from Game 1 is that it was only one game. New York was dominated for almost the entire 60 minutes on Wednesday night and generated only sporadic pressure while the Penguins were all over them. The Islanders looked nothing like the team that went 11-1-2 down the stretch to earn its first playoff berth since 2007.
One key for the Islanders in Game 2 will be to avoid dwelling on their poor showing in Game 1.

&gt; ""That's behind us

**Big Story:** After the Pittsburgh Penguins blitzed the New York Islanders in the series opener, electrifying the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum crowd, the Penguins responded to score the next four goals and eventually earned a 5-4 overtime win when Chris Kunitz connected on a power play 8:44 into overtime. They'll now aim to take a 3-1 lead back to Consol Energy Center. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; When it went on a two-man advantage with just over seven minutes remaining in the first period of Game 3

&gt; Even though the Penguins would let a two-goal lead of their own slip away in the third

&gt; ""We did a great job of hanging in there









**Islanders:**

&gt; Carrying the momentum into its first home game in the Stanley Cup Playoffs in six years

&gt; Of course, then John Tavares forced overtime with his first career playoff goal. A holding penalty by Brian Strait led to the game-winner by Kunitz, but the Islanders weren't hanging their heads afterward.

&gt; ""We didn't come into this series wanting to make it close. We wanted to win the series. We believe in ourselves and all the guys in here









From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030114&amp;navid=sb:preview     )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; Pittsburgh has played the entire series without defenseman Brooks Orpik (lower body) while forward James Neal skated 8:09 in Game 1 before sustaining an ankle injury that has sidelined him the past two games. Both took part in an optional skate on Monday. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Sidney Crosby had three assists in Game 3 after scoring two goals in his return to the lineup on Friday.Evgeni Malkin made a great pass to set up the first Kunitz goal and has three straight multi-point games to start the series. Iginla had two assists in each of the first two games before scoring his first playoff goal for the Penguins on Sunday. Kunitz finished the game with three points. … Moulson and Okposo have each scored in consecutive games for the Islanders.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Both teams will be well-rested and eager to get back to the Stanley Cup chase after relatively easy five-game series wins in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. The Penguins' offense erupted for 22 goals against the Ottawa Senators

&gt; Jarome Iginla



---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Like its opponent, shoring up on the back end and in goal. Indeed, as the conference final begins, the Penguins appear to be clicking on all cylinders again.

&gt; Vokoun is 6-1 with a 1.85 goals-against average and .941 save percentage since getting the call for Game 5 of the Islanders series. Kris Letang leads NHL defensemen in scoring with 16 points

&gt; ""It's going to be fun, a well-balanced team with a lot of depth, some good players. So it's going to be a good challenge for us.
 
&gt; ""Since I've been here














**Bruins:**

&gt; The momentum from an amazing Game 7 comeback against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round appeared to carry over for Boston

&gt; The Bruins survived despite a banged-up defense that got Dennis Seidenberg back in Game 5 and could have fellow veteran Andrew Ference in the lineup again soon. Their absences allowed Torey Krug

&gt; Boston also received balanced scoring from its forwards

&gt; ""We've played against [Pittsburgh] enough and we have a lot of respect for that team,"" said forward Gregory Campbell, who scored twice in the close-out game against the Rangers. ""And they know how to win, so I think it will be a great matchup. We're excited about it, and we're going to have to be good.""













From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030311&amp;navid=sb:preview     )

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ference (lower body) and defenseman Wade Redden (upper body) missed the entirety of the second round for Boston. Ference has been practicing with the team and could be a Game 1 possibility.

### Who´s Hot:

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Holding Sidney Crosby, Chris Kunitz, Pascal Dupuis, Jarome Iginla and Kris Letang off the board in the same game isn't an easy feat to accomplish, but the Ottawa Senators did it Sunday night. They also got an incredible shorthanded goal in the final half-minute of the third period and went on to defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins 2-1 in double overtime to climb back into their Eastern Conference Semifinals series. They'll try to tie things up Wednesday before action shifts back to Consol Energy Center. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; The opportunity is still there for Pittsburgh to make this a short series -- a victory in Game 4 would give them a commanding 3-1 lead heading back home. But the Penguins also may be in for a fight similar to or even greater than the one the New York Islanders gave them in the first round

&gt; Tyler Kennedy's goal late in the second period and the shutout goaltending of Tomas Vokoun had the Penguins up 1-0 in the latter stages of the third when Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson was sent off for slashing the stick of Matt Cooke. The Penguins didn't need to score

&gt; ""We let this one slip away, and there's nothing we can do about it. … We're still up 2-1 [in the series] and now Wednesday is a big game for us.""












**Senators:**

&gt; The big story at the start of Game 3 was the return of center Jason Spezza to the lineup after missing more than three months following back surgery. Spezza didn't have a point and was on the ice for Kennedy's goal

&gt; By the end of the night, and Colin Greening scoring the winner 7:39 into the second OT despite still having shards of fiberglass in his cheek from a high stick he took earlier in the contest.

&gt; ""I think if you look at our team,"" Greening said. ""In a situation like tonight when you're down 1-0, to be honest, they were playing really well in the last 10 minutes, they were staying above us and it was hard to get any momentum. But we had to keep at it and stay with the structure of our team. It was nice to see because you get rewarded for things like that.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ottawa forward Chris Neil suffered an arm injury in Game 3 but has been cleared to play. DefensemanEric Gryba (upper body) has missed the past two games. Defenseman Patrick Wiercioch (lower body) hasn't played since Game 3 of the first round against the Montreal Canadiens.

**Season Series:** This is the rubber match of the three-game season series between the Pittsburgh and Winnipeg and the first game at Consol Energy Center. The Jets won the first meeting, 3-1, on Feb. 15. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Pittsburgh has won 13 straight while dealing with key injuries to Kris Letang and Evgeni Malkin. Marc-Andre Fleury is on that list now

Fleury was injured in a 1-0 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday and had to leave the game. He's still being evaluated

Letang returned to the lineup Tuesday after missing three games

Malkin

Regardless of all the injuries

""He's going to bring a lot


















**Jets:**  They've won two straight since losing back-to-back games to the Washington Capitals by a combined 10-1 score.

Winnipeg has taken a six-point lead in the Southeast Division and is on its way to securing at least the third seed in the Eastern Conference.

""We're trying to forget about that Washington mini-series as much as possible
Kane broke a three-game pointless drought with a goal and three assists to pace the Jets in Carolina. Nik Antropov









__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Kane will look to build on his four-point night in Carolina

**Injury Report:** Jets defensemen Mark Stuart (undisclosed) and Zach Redmond (thigh) as well as forwards Jim Slater(upper body) and Anthony Peluso (hand) have been out of the lineup. … The Penguins will be without Letang (broken toe). Fleury (sore neck) and Malkin are questionable.

**Season Series:** This is the second of three meetings. The Carolina Hurricanes earned a 4-1 victory against thePittsburgh Penguins on Feb. 28 at PNC Arena. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:** Pittsburgh is coming off a split of a home-and-home series against the New York Rangers. After getting blown out in a 6-1 loss at Madison Square Garden last Wednesday

Pittsburgh enters Tuesday’s action three points ahead of the Montreal Canadiens for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Penguins officially clinched a spot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Sunday

“It’s always nice to have the X get put up there and know you’re going to the postseason, but it’s just the first step. We’re looking at these nine games with this group as a lot of areas to get better.

“Certainly just getting into the playoffs is not our goal. (Our goal) is not where we want to finish at the end of the regular season



















**Hurricanes:**  Carolina’s playoff chances are in serious jeopardy. The Hurricanes are winless this month

“I just think we have to take the positives, just try to move on and move forward and get ready for the game tomorrow.""











__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Pens forward Chris Kunitz has a goal and three assists in the past five games

**Player Bio:**


Born on December 6th 1986 in Virginia Minnesota, the Virginia/Mountain Iron-Buhl Blue Devil’s to their first state high school tournament appearance.  He was then drafted 28th overall by the Dallas Stars in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft and played for two years in the WCHA (Western Collegiate Hockey Association) totaling 45 (10G 35A) points in 77 games with the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs, and being named All WCHA First team in the 2006-2007 season.  After his sophomore year Niskanen decided to leave college and begin his professional career, signing an amateur try-out contract with the Iowa Stars on March 17th 2007, he would go on to sign a three-year contract with the Dallas Stars at the beginning on the 2007-2008 season and make the roster out of training camp.  Over the next four seasons Niskanen would play in 277 regular season games with the Stars, collecting 79 points (16G 63A) and an overall +/- of -5.  Most Pens fans probably remember his time with the Stars for when he fought Sidney Crosby during a game in Dallas on November 3rd 2010. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXhwSyTQS2M)  Since coming to the Pens in a trade, Niskanen’s time in Pittsburgh has been fairly standard for a d-man of his talent level, and 6 (1G 5A) points in 26 Playoff games.

**Career**

**Benefit to team:**

Trying to write down what Niskanen brings to the table is kind of difficult.  I’m not saying he’s a bad player by any means but I have trouble remembering specific times where he stood out, and he’s also prone to making costly mistakes that can lead to offensive opportunities for the opposing team.  I will admit that he cut down on those mistakes during this past shortened season, but I find myself asking if he is really worth the 2.3m cap hit.  Next season the top 4 D-men will be Letang/Martin/Orpik/Scuderi, leaving only two spots for Niskanen/Engallend/Depres/Bortuzzo, while Niskanen is without a doubt the top option for the bottom pairing he is the most expensive of the three by far; and seeing as how Despres and Bortuzzo were both re-signed this off-season Niskanen’s future seems in doubt.  Couple his inconsistent play with the Pens current cap issues I would not be terribly surprised to see him traded during this upcoming season, and even if he does stay the entire season I don’t see any way Shero can feasibly bring him back unless he takes a major pay cut.


**A couple highlights:**

[Goal vs. WSH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL6Bdjca5y0)

[Big hit on Jonathan Haberdeau](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDYntlI97IE)


**Closing Thoughts:**

Overall he wasn’t a bad acquisition as he was pretty much brought in to fill the hole when Goligoski left


/u/terotheterror would like to remind everyone that we still have a couple players available

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Both teams had semi-unexpected results in their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series. The top-seeded Penguins struggled with the eighth-seeded New York Islanders more than most people expected, cruising to a five-game series win. These teams were the only ones to average four goals per game or more during the first round, and each has the offensive personnel to create fireworks in this conference semifinal. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; The big question in Pittsburgh for the remainder of the playoffs figures to center around the goaltending.Tomas Vokoun allowed three goals on 69 shots over the final two games to stabilize the position after Marc-Andre Fleury's struggles in Games 2 through 4 threatened to derail the Penguins' anticipated run deep into the postseason. However

&gt; Offensively

&gt; ""We have confidence in both guys, but it's not up to us to decide who goes into net.""











**Senators:**

&gt; With this series the first of the conference semifinals to get under way

&gt; And that's important, posting six points to tie with Karlsson for the team lead, and late-season call-up Jean-Gabriel Pageau had a Game 3 hat trick.

&gt; ""Opportunity, you see that teams are peaking at this time of year and it's the best time to peak. Whether you're third seed or fourth seed or whatever seed you are, that doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're playing at this time of year.""











From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030211&amp;navid=sb:preview    )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ottawa forward Jason Spezza is the wild card in this series -- he's been skating with the team and testing out his back after surgery for a herniated disk limited him to just five games in January. There's speculation Spezza could play in this series

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Kyle Turris has goals in three consecutive games for the Senators. Cory Conacher scored the tying goal in Game 4 against the Canadiens, notching three goals and six assists.

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Pittsburgh was picked as a Stanley Cup favorite prior to the start of the season, Brenden Morrow and Douglas Murray in separate deals.

&gt; As the top seed in the East, who has yet to make an appearance in this series). But these Pens find themselves in a dogfight after dropping Game 4, and they must win two of the next three just to advance to the second round.

&gt; The good news is

&gt; “With all the expectations that we have and with the way things have been going, we haven’t played our best hockey yet. But we can’t change anything about what’s happened already. Our focus moving forward is the preparation and getting ready for this next game.

&gt; “It’s a best-out-of-3 now. We’re confident in the group that we have. We just have to make sure that we’re playing better.”









**Islanders:**

&gt; It hardly mattered to the Islanders that few thought they would even qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. It mattered even less when most “experts” picked them to lose this best-of-7 series to the No. 1 Penguins in no more than five games.

&gt; All that matters is that they believe in themselves. That belief – not to mention there’s more talent on the roster than most give them credit for – is why this series became a best-of-3 when they earned a 6-4 victory on home ice in Game 4.

&gt; “The last three games have been really good, but I think we play our best when we all play the same way, and that’s just playing simple.”

**Season Series:**  Fifth and final meeting of the regular season between these Atlantic Division rivals. The Islanders won the opening matchup
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Is this the day Jarome Iginla makes his Pittsburgh debut? That seemed questionable in the 24 hours leading up, 4-0, with veteran goalie Tomas Vokoun registering his 50th career shutout. Showing their tremendous depth, the Pens received a pair of goals from Pascal Dupuis, giving him 17 in just 35 games this season.

""We have great players -- and even the great players understand what we need to do to win



















**Islanders:**  Coupled with the rival Rangers being shut out in Ottawa, Colin McDonald tallied twice in the third, and after a late Scott Hartnell goal for the Flyers forced extra time, Josh Bailey connected in the fourth round of the penalty-shot tiebreaker.

""We need the two points in any way shape or form, but every line contributed and we battled back. We finished checks, created opportunities down low and it feels good to get this one here.""










__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Tavares has goals in three consecutive games for the Islanders

**Injury Report:** New York forward David Ullstrom (groin) is on injured reserve. … Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury left Tuesday's game against Montreal with a sore neck after a goalmouth collision and didn't dress Thursday. He's day-to-day

**Season Series:** It’s the first meeting between the teams. They’ll see each other twice in the next six days.
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Not much is new in Pittsburgh, Crosby, tied a career high with five assists on the night.

It will be a tall order when Crosby goes up against Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara. With Evgeni Malkin (upper body) out of the lineup, and the only one to have each forward boast 10 or more goals. Add James Neal to the mix, and the Pens have four double-digit scorers.











**Bruins:**  Boston got off to a slow start against Ottawa on Monday, coach Claude Julien addressed the injury.

“He’s been looked at

Boston may have one of the toughest defenses in the NHL

e to get back to the way we were playing on the road -- to get back into that mindset and how we've been successful.""









__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Fresh off being named the National Hockey League’s second star of the week

**Injury Report:** Malkin is expected to miss 1-2 weeks. … The Bruins will likely be playing without Kelly after Monday’s collision.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; In the previous round, finds its back against the wall after losing the first two games of the Eastern Conference Final on home ice. The Boston Bruins chased Tomas Vokoun from Game 2 and further muddled the Penguins' goaltending situation. Back home for a pair of games at TD Garden, they'll attempt to turn what most experts predicted as a six- or seven-game series into something much shorter. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; When Pittsburgh coach Dan Bylsma turned to Vokoun for Game 5 against the New York Islanders in the first round

&gt; Vokoun couldn't be faulted much for Pittsburgh's 3-0 loss to Boston in Game 1, and Fleury was back in the crease. The Penguins seemed to seize momentum when Brandon Sutter scored with 34 seconds left in the first, but Fleury allowed a goal 25 seconds later by Brad Marchand on the first shot he faced. Fleury ended up stopping 14 of 17 shots and it's questionable whether he showed Bylsma enough to earn the Game 3 start in what will be hostile territory.

&gt; ""It's not a feeling where we want to be













**Bruins:**

&gt; Following the morning skate prior to Game 2, they did just that.

&gt; The Bruins were all over the Penguins at both ends of the ice

&gt; ""We pretty much dominated that game












From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030313&amp;navid=sb:preview     )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; It's expected Boston defenseman Wade Redden, but the return to health of Dennis Seidenberg and Andrew Ference coupled with the emergence of rookie Torey Krug makes that an unlikely scenario. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Horton has five points in the series. He's posted three goals and five assists during a four-game points streak. Krejci has three goals and continues to lead in playoff scoring with 20 points. Defenseman Johnny Boychuk

**Big Story:**  

&gt; For as much trouble as the New York Islanders gave them in the first round, who got a rude awakening that they're now facing a team with a few more weapons than the Montreal Canadiens. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; There was plenty of talk in between rounds about whether coach Dan Bylsma might go back to Marc-Andre Fleury against Ottawa


&gt; Evgeni Malkin, then tied David Krejci of the Boston Bruins for the lead in points with 13 when he potted the game-winning goal at 12:15 of the first. Chris Kunitz added a power-play goal in addition to Dupuis' shorthanded tally to cap the offense.


&gt; ""We are way more near where we need to be [in Game 1], and we were able to get in the offensive zone because of that.


&gt; ""Tonight was a much better indication of where we need to play 5-on-5."" 











**Senators:**

&gt; Some of the pluck Ottawa showed in its five-game elimination of Montreal was present Tuesday in the series opener


&gt; For the night they put 36 shots on goal and generated their fair share of scoring chances


&gt; ""They played a little bit better than we did today











From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030212&amp;navid=sb:preview     )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ottawa defenseman Eric Gryba left Game 1 with an upper-body injury and is day-to-day. Defenseman Patrick Wiercioch (lower body) has been out since Game 3 of the Montreal series. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Erik Condra set up Greening's goal with a shot Vokoun had trouble handling; Condra finished the previous series for the Senators with a three-point Game 5 effort. … Malkin (3-10-13)

**Chris Kunitz** - Scored and added an assist for a total of 61 pts this season. Also a new career high for him. He had 60 pts a few years back with the Ducks.

**Pascal Dupuis** - Big big year for Duper. He set a new career high for himself in goals

**MATT COOKE** - Played his 82nd game of the season. This means he didn't receive a single suspension all year! What a turn around. AND he had a new career high in goals with 19

**Sidney Crosby** - After missing 41 games last year, being out for another 40, Sid ended up with 37pts in 22 games. That's 1.68 Pts/G.

**Brooks Orpik** - A personal best for Orpik this year

**Evgeni Malkin** - Of course the one everyone will focus on

**Marc-Andre Fleury** - Fleury finished with 42 Wins on the season

Congrats to all these guys for brilliant performances this season!!

***edit*** **James Neal** - How did I forget Neal (thanks BareFootEJ) with is 40G and 41A!!?? Also a career-year for him! Hopefully these last two games he missed were just to rest some soreness before the playoffs.

**Big Story:** After rallying for a 4-3 victory in Game 2 to earn a split of the first two games

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; After steamrolling the Islanders 5-0 in Game 1

&gt; Despite his superb return -- he was named the game's No. 2 star -- Crosby said he was feeling the effects of missing 13 games.

&gt; ""All right

&gt; With the quick turnaround

&gt; ""It's the playoffs. You lose games sometimes, and we definitely have room to improve.""








**Islanders:**

&gt; The scared, making the Penguins play defense. New York finished with 42 shots and used a couple of fortuitous bounces off the end boards to overtake the Penguins and even the series. Kyle Okposo's game-winner came on a shot from the slot that missed the net but caromed off the end boards into the crease, where it deflected off goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury and into the net.

&gt; It was the sixth time in 26 road games this season in which the Islanders won after trailing by two goals.

&gt; ""We've had a few wins like that, who had an assist in Game 2 and was a factor all night long. ""That's been the story of our season. We had a great second half of the game. We really brought it, and found a way to get it done. That was a big win for us, and we're looking forward to getting back home in front of our fans.""


&gt; The Islanders appeared to relax after falling behind in Game 2 -- they just went out and played. It's a formula they need to continue on Sunday.


&gt; ""We have to keep things loose and have fun

### Injury Report:

&gt; Pittsburgh played Game 2 without all-star forward James Neal, who hasn't played in the series due to a lower-body injury. Neal skated briefly at practice Saturday before leaving early; Orpik and center Evgeni Malkin did not skate at all … The Islanders report no injuries.

**Penguins:** The Penguins lost captain Sidney Crosby on Saturday

""Obviously, but at the same time we've got some good depth on this team and that gives a chance for some guys to step up, and definitely for some new guys we just acquired to step up.”

In previous years, Douglas Murray and Iginla.




















**Sabres:**  Don’t count the Sabres out of the playoff picture just yet. Although they sit 13th in the conference

The Sabres were held off the scoreboard against the Bruins on Sunday, Thomas Vanek has been sidelined with an injury and they are struggling to replace his points. Buffalo’s defense is also sitting towards the bottom of the NHL, currently ranked 25th with a goals-against average of 3.00.

In addition to the current adversaries the Sabres are facing

**Last 10:**  Pittsburgh 8-2-0

**Season Series:** This is the third of three meetings. The Pittsburgh Penguins took the first two games and will be looking to sweep the Ottawa Senators on Monday at Scotiabank Place. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; After clinching the top spot in the Eastern Conference on Saturday

&gt; Penguins coach Dan Bylsma took a different approach to addressing the situation. When asked if he expects shenanigans in Ottawa

&gt; The Penguins have recalled enforcer Steve MacIntyre from its American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and could possibly dress him for the game

&gt; Depending on how the season finishes




**Senators:**

&gt; Like Pittsburgh
&gt; Ottawa is currently one point behind the Islanders for the sixth seed in the East, the New York Rangers, Washington and the Islanders are all competing to make the playoffs with only four spots remaining.

&gt; After a devastating 4-1 loss to Toronto on Saturday




From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012020677 4 )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; Sidney Crosby (broken jaw), and Evgeni Malkin(upper body) will not play. Kris Letang (illness) is a game-time decision for Pittsburgh. … Mike Hoffman (collarbone) and Spezza (back surgery) will not play for the Sens. Karlsson (achilles laceration) is a game-time decision. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt; Before Saturday’s win in Boston


---

### Trivia:

&gt; The Penguins are 21 – 3 - 0 against playoff teams this year and 9 – 0 against seeds two through four. In comparison

&gt; If the Penguins win tonight

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Any hopes the Ottawa Senators have of getting back into this Eastern Conference Semifinal series will hinge on their performance in Game 3 against the Pittsburgh Penguins. After dropping the first two games of the series in Pittsburgh

&gt; Senators forward Jason Spezza practiced Saturday without a no-contact jersey and is expected to play. He was limited to five games this season with a back injury.



---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**
&gt; It didn't take long for center Sidney Crosby to make his mark on Game 2 of the series. The Penguins captain walked past Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson and beat goalie Craig Anderson to open the scoring. Kyle Turris would reply for Ottawa 10 minutes later, who was pulled and replaced byRobin Lehner.

&gt; Ottawa would continue to battle back throughout the game

&gt; ""Right from the drop of the puck we came out and had some great chances, but our first two games were good overall games.""










**Senators:**

&gt; The final score may have been close in Game 2

&gt; Perhaps most worrisome for Ottawa is the play of Anderson. After appearing unbeatable in the opening round against the Montreal Canadiens, starting from their net on out.

&gt; They'll surely benefit from the return of Spezza. The all-star confirmed Saturday he would be back for Game 3.

&gt; ""The obvious challenge is the speed of the game and hopping right into the playoffs isn't easy












From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030213&amp;navid=sb:preview)

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; The Penguins are fielding a healthy lineup. … Senators forward Mike Hoffman (upper body) is out. Defensemen Eric Gryba and Patrick Wiercioch are questionable.

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Penguins defenseman Kris Letang has eight points in his past six games. Center Evgeni Malkin is tied for the playoff lead with 14 points. Crosby is right behind him with 12 points. … Ottawa's Jean-Gabriel Pageau has six points in his past five games. Turris has four goals in his past five games. Erik Condra has five points in his current three-game point streak.

**TV:** RDS

**Season Series:** This will be the second of three meetings. The first match was a wild 7-6 overtime win for the Pens
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  The longest winning streak this season and first place in the East wasn’t enough for Pens general manager Ray Shero

It should be interesting to see what Pens coach Dan Bylsma does with the lineup card against the Habs. With Evgeni Malkin close to being back

Morrow’s leadership and skills on Malkin’s line would be the perfect compliment to Sidney Crosby’s line


















**Canadiens:**  Montreal coach Michel Therrien will be behind the bench in Pittsburgh for the first time since he was relieved of his duties in February of 2009. Therrien’s Canadiens are nipping at the heels of the Pens for first place in the Eastern Conference. Montreal is five points back

The Habs are coming off a tough 2-1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night

“They have a lot of world class players so obviously we have to do make sure we’re doing the right things

Montreal goalie Carey Price will surely appreciate the extra help around the net against the League’s highest-scoring team. In his last four starts against the Penguins









__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury

**Injury Report:** Kris Letang and Malkin will be game-time decisions for the Penguins. The Habs will be without Rene Bourque and Raphael Diaz

**Season Series:** This is the second of three meetings. The teams played here Tuesday
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Pittsburgh's methodical climb to the top of the Eastern Conference was built on offensive production spurred by Sidney Crosby and Chris Kunitz. Saturday against the Rangers

""When we go out there we try to do our best to play responsible (on defense) and then capitalize on our chances

The shutout capped a run of four games in which the Penguins have allowed four goals

""The stability at which he plays -- a stay-at-home defenseman, position-wise, has been excellent.""

Marc-Andre Fleury was barely tested making 23 saves for his franchise-record 23rd career shutout and could be given his first consecutive-days starts of the season.

""We all know how good [Fleury] is

Bylsma would not rule out a return by forward Evgeni Malkin














**Bruins:**  After avenging its second-most-recent loss Saturday

""We'd like to bring this kind of game into tomorrow's game and get another 60-minute effort, and hopefully we'll bring that to Pittsburgh tomorrow.""

Julien challenged the line of Nathan Horton, including Krejci's 300th career point.

""I like the way we played

The Bruins blocked 26 shots in the game Tuesday with backup Anton Khudobin in net. Tuukka Rask likely will start Sunday.






__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** The Bruins are 5-0-0 in day games this season. The line of Patrice Bergeron

**Injury Report:** Malkin is the only injured Penguins player. … Bruins forward Chris Kelly (broken leg) is out.

## Player Summary

Born 30 December 1978 in Syosset

He was drafted shortly after his 1st college season, and began his professional career in 2001 with the WBS Pens.  Over the next 2 season with the Baby Pens he would play 149 games, score 5 goals and tally 39 assists.  In 2003 he had his first shot at the big leagues, playing 13 games for the Pens.  During the lockout the following season he again played with WBS, before gaining a permanent spot on the NHL Pens in the 2005-2006 season.  Scuderi continued to play for the Pens up until the '09 cup win after which he signed a 4 year contract with the Los Angeles Kings.  Three years after winning a cup with the Pens, he won one with the Kings ('11-'12).

**Interesting Fact:** He's the first Long Island native to have his name engraved on the cup.

|PIM|4|0|

## Benefit to the Team

Scuderi is the kind of defenseman that the Pens were sorely missing last season, but more of a stay-at-home defenseman who can lay solid hits and keep the crease nice and empty.  His addition this off-season could be pivotal to the Penguins defensive success, and since he has already played with the Penguins it should be an easy transition.  He will almost certainly be one of the top 4 defensemen, and most speculate he will be paired with Letang, a positive since Letang is strong in the o-zone and weaker in the d-zone (the opposite of Scuderi).

## Highlights

* [Picking up some goalie slack and saving the cup run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMcQLu_K_Xw) - sorry for the quality
* [Wonderful hip check on Zubrus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKGO0gJNyEo)

## Final Thoughts

I was excited when I heard we had signed Scuderi again

**Big Story:**  

&gt; It's no secret the Pittsburgh Penguins have the type of offense that can erupt at any time and blow the opposition out of the water -- unfortunately for the Ottawa Senators


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Frustrated by the goaltending of Craig Anderson in a failed attempt to take a 3-0 series lead Sunday, and Dupuis scored shorthanded as the Penguins' special teams came up big down the stretch. Jarome Iginla added his second goal of the game on a power play after Robin Lehner came on in relief.

&gt; Goalie Tomas Vokoun won for the fifth time in six starts since taking over for Marc-Andre Fleury. Now the Penguins will try to avoid giving the Senators any life the way they did in Game 3 and earn themselves a little extra rest with a victory.

&gt; ""It was a tough one the other night to lose













**Senators:**

&gt; Throughout the Stanley Cup Playoffs

&gt; That went down in a flurry of Pittsburgh goals

&gt; ""Your focus has to go into [Game 5]













From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030215&amp;navid=sb:preview     )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ottawa defenseman Eric Gryba (upper body) has been skating but hasn't played since leaving Game 1 of this series. … Pittsburgh forward Brenden Morrow (undisclosed) missed Game 4. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Alfredsson has a goal in consecutive games and a team-leading 10 points for the playoffs. … Penguins defenseman Kris Letang had a four-assist game Wednesday and has 13 points in 10 games

“Obviously,” Laviolette said.

In any other season

Also of note

My only experience with Hockey was playing NHL for the playstation 1. My memory is a bit fuzzy on those rules and I'm sure there have probably been some changes since then. Are there good resources to get more familiar with the game? Are there any quick basics you can impart so I can enjoy these afternoon games a bit more? Anything else you'd like to say to help out a possible fan?

P.S. I'm thinking of making the Penguins ""my team"" because of already being a Steelers fan. Is there anything that I should know specifically about the Penguins?",self,t5_2r549,False,,87,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/penguins/comments/1e70em/new_to_hockey_thinking_about_following_the_sport/

**Season Series:** It's the fourth of five meetings this season. Pittsburgh has won the last two
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Pittsburgh is perfect in March

The Penguins are the first team in NHL history to have 10-game win streaks in three consecutive seasons.

""The importance is probably greater just because of a shortened season,"" captain Sidney Crosby said.
















**Islanders:**  If NHL games were 40 minutes long

The Isles blew a 3-1 lead by allowing four third-period goals to Ottawa on Tuesday

""We've got to have that killer instinct and understand that we can't lay off the gas pedal a little bit just because we've got the lead or we're playing well







__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Crosby is running away with the scoring title and has five points in his past four games. Marc-Andre Fleury has won his last five starts

**Injury Report:** Pittsburgh star Evgeni Malkin is hoping to return against the Islanders after two days of practice. Defenseman Kris Letang (lower body) didn't practice Thursday and appears less likely to play. … The Islanders are without ex-Penguins defenseman Brian Strait (ankle) and forward David Ullstrom (groin).
