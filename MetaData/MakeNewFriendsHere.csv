1360906281.0,18kewz,Statistics warning: I decided to check the number of comments based on sex of the poster...,Lord_Squint,47,5,28,"Well

http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/18i5vf/its_funny_how_each_female_post_on_this_subreddit/ 

made me curious as to the imbalance between male and female posters vs comments. And since I am enjoying my son deciding to sleep

The basics: I reloaded /r/MakeNewFriendsHere and started looking at the poster and the number of comments. Plain and simple. I took no regard of age, anything. Just sex of poster, and number of comments. (I lied, my son woke up about halfway through this part and started screaming). Since I didn't want to spend hours on this, I just took the first 30 posts that I ran into for each sex, and counted the number of comments.

Some guidelines:

- I didn't count posts with more than one person.

- I didn't count posts that were a random question (what's your favorite food that...).

- I DID count posts that had 0 responses

******The results:******

Average number of comments:

Male poster: 8.9

Female poster: 27.4

Now

- There were 3 posts that had zero comments

- If I removed the top and bottom 2 outliers for each sex: male averaged 6.96 comments

- The outliers mentioned above were (2 highest, 0, 0. For females: 121, 114, 4, 3. So apparently even the really boring females were enough to get a tiny bit of attention. Sorry bros.

- My nerd side wanted to complete the basic statistics and get the median as well as the mean. Male: 4.5

Disclaimer: This was a super small survey and so obviously could be more precise if I decided to expand the pool of posts studied. However, I did NOT look at subjects of any posts, anything said, age of poster, whether they acted like a tool, even if they couldn't type and were just banging their forehead into the keyboard... I just took the first 30 male and female posts that I ran into and got the number of comments.

**TL:DR Women are more entertaining than men.**

Keep doing what you all do! And I feel obligated to say it: join us on IRC and keep me from being bored at work (button is -----------&gt;). Follow the rules and play nice kids.

So

In terms of the short and simple qualities, [INFJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFJ#Characteristics_of_INFJs), and live in New England. 

In terms of, as far as anyone who'd want to befriend me is concerned, I'm...complex. I'm very intuitive, and often follow trains of thoughts that seem intangible or perplexing from an outside point of view, but this typically manifests as mere 'peculiar behavior'--or, as society more often prefers, I'm a weird geek. 

More relevantly, often going to great lengths to ensure that they're never troubled or upset, regardless of the difficult or lack of plausibility this brings up. 

I have a Steam account--avid gamer--, all of which I'd be happy to friend people on. My interests gravitate toward books and videogames. (I'm a bookworm, if a somewhat ignorant and not-well-versed one.)

And...alright, I'm lonely. Not in terms of the romantic ""Oh, gosh, I MUST have a loving caring partner NOW, or I will COMBUST,"" or anything typically attached to a statement like ""I'm lonely."" I mean more like I...often feel misunderstood by those around me. Which is also common, but what I'm trying to get at here is that I want a new friend who I can connect with on a deep level without being romantically involved with in any way. A 'partner in crime

I got in contact with the mods who said it was okay to make a post here about a new subreddit you can check out /r/randomactsofcards. (This post has also been x-posted to /r/needafriend) It's a new subreddit to either give or receive cards to anyone who wants one.  It can also be a good way to make a new friend. 

One of my close friendships started with a card.  I sent a deployed soldier in Afghanistan a card.  It took a month before he unexpectedly replied back.  From there it went to Facebook friends


So if you get a chance come check out /r/randomactsofcards.  Make an offer or a request.  Do a card swap if you like.  Look through other posts to see what people's interests are and comment on it if you have something in common.  You never know what might happen. :)

* Hannibal (I have 2 episodes left of the first season. I will probably finish it tonight

* Teen Wolf (BIG MAYBE. and only to make fun of it. It deserves a MST3K-ing I think.)

You can register by clicking register on the top right I believe.

You click Make a New Topic on the right side in that forum and you can post a little about yourself and we'll all stop in to say hello!

I'm a 25-yr-old girl from Germany looking for people that I can hopefully develop fun, for numerous reasons. In addition to that I simply like getting to know/interacting with people. I'm pretty outgoing, extroverted, social and optimistic. I'd definitely call myself a people-person. 

A little about myself: 

I'm addicted to anything audio. My favorite bands are Queens of the Stone Age (anything involving Joshua Homme for that matter), Bring Me The Horizon, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Sigur Rós. 

Whenever people ask me what's my favorite movie I say Fight Club though I do have many favorites. Unfortunately I spend too much time watching tv shows. 

I have eight tattoos and I plan on getting many more. Other interests of mine are reading, history. I used to play tennis and I still occasionally watch the Grand Slams. I'm a Saints and Giants fan but I wouldn't call myself an expert when it comes to football.

My humor is a little weird at times but anything cracks me up really

Hello everyone! I'm looking to make friends with similar interests as I don't often get to talk about the things I love with many people in my day-to-day life. Let me tell you a bit about myself.



I'm a student in university studying physics. If you've got a similar inclination

Miscellany:

* I quite like music. I've been playing the drums for 11 years now and I sometimes like to mess around on the piano, metal, instrumental music. Here are a couple examples of what I'm currently listening to! - [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0NyZPZdOrs), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKeTD8E8Nkg), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWTWM6XUoC0), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rFPXc9sWtDc), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWI0l4I2RaE). Let me know what you think!

* I enjoy reading. I generally read fantasy

* I tend to prefer television shows to movies as I feel they allow more time for character/plot development. My list of favorites includes but is not limited to: Star Trek, Breaking Bad, Flight of the Conchords, Archer. Just started watching Orange is the New Black, but I haven't seen enough to comment on its quality. I also watch a fair amount of documentaries. Anything regarding space is sure to pique my interest. I also enjoy the occasional episode of 'How It's Made' or the like. I did say I prefer tv shows, but that doesn't mean I don't like movies. In fact, there are a few I'm quite fond of. A few of my favorite movies: Midnight in Paris, The Room, among several others. Looking for a tv show or movie watching buddy? I'm your guy. 


* I'm learning to speak french. I'm not very far along, please let me know. I've been using [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com) and that's been working rather well. Also, the Pimsleur audio lessons work very well.

* I like to go disc golfing in my free time. I also occasionally play tennis and racquetball. 

* My personality type is INTJ. Curious about which type you are? Take the test [here](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp).  
 
* Want to see something awesome? Check out [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKPrGxB1Kzc) video about a creature that lives in the ocean.

I am 15, but I like to think that I don't let any of those things influence my personality. 

When it comes to school I am conscientious, Chemistry, Geography and German. 

Apart from all schoolwork, going out either to watch movies, parties or simply just hang out. I also enjoy travelling and meeting new people so I can consider that I am quite sociable. :)

~~(And even though I might commit Reddit suicide I'll have to admit that I prefer dogs to cats)~~ 

When it comes to music I can only think I have a weird bipolar thing going: I enjoy indie and hard rock

I also read books

You can hit me up any time

thanks and have a lovely time. you're awesome!

1367444770.0,1dic9k,35/M/Toronto. Evening strolls or simply shooting the shit by the Harbourfront?,teeohent,10,3,0,"I'm a very plain individual. Plain as a white cotton t-shirt I sometimes say.

I live in downtown Toronto, a (mostly) 9-5 job with various hobbies and interests that keep me amused. Not a whole lot of excitement happens in my life, and I try to maintain it that way on purpose.

I'm very fortunate to, I spend my personal downtime by taking myself for a stroll down by the Harbourfront area for a good hour or so - even when it's raining or snowing. When I go on these strolls, I listen to music, the news, text or call up a friend to shoot the shit for a bit, browse the web, or just take in the scenery and wax philosophical about life and the grandiosity of it.

That's all spiffy and good...so what am I doing here??? I'm trying to answer the question ""Surely there must be others like me!?""

Every now and then

By life state, 60 minutes or whatever, and then we simply go on our way to live our respective lives for the rest of the evening. Rinse and repeat every now and then.

I'd like to think that I'm a very open minded individual and won't judge you for your lifestyle if you don't judge me. I am mature and immature all at once. I'm old (relative to the the demographic here)

I typically don't drink (because of my unhumanly low tolerance for alchohol), but I felt it necessary to state my position on this for some reason.

I smoke cigs

I'm a proud Ent, you might not. There's no way I will be able to tell. If we ever hit up a smoke lounge, then sure whatever, but out in the open in a public space, sorry...byob. I will *not* share/sell trees. Period. Please understand that this is a firm position that I'm taking for my own safety. It's unfortunate, but I feel it is a reality of the current state of affairs on this front.  I would prefer meeting ent-friendly people, but they don't have to be ents themselves.

I'm not interested in organized meetups or group get togethers. That's a different aspect of my life that has already been fulfilled by my occassional participation in local photography club meetups.

One might ask: where's yo' wife in all of this? She likes to spend her downtime in different ways (prime time TV

My social network is quite 'complete.' I have a great network of close friends as well as an obligatory 'best friend', kids, prefer to stay home, etc.) I'm understanding. It's all good.

Still

I may possibly be among the most lonely

I always enjoy meeting new and friendly people, which is varied.

As the saying goes: The scope of my interests are a kilometre wide

Lastly

So with all that said...if you're the type that likes to do what I do

I'll toss out a bit about me if you're interested. I'm sure there's something we'll have in common. I have way too many hobbies, fire spinning, lock sport, Warhammer miniature conversions/painting and photography. I have a passion for anthropology and the engineering fields, though I have absolutely no formal training on either.

My favorite music is instrumental, Kashiwa Daisuke, God is an Astronaut and World's End Girlfriend. I don't watch very many movies or much television, so it's unfortunate I'm pretty ignorant of media culture in general.

My first memory ever is a headache. The worst, I had a headache. I was treated by my pediatrician from age five years old for a recurring sinus infection that was never really there. One day, when I was eight years old, I was taken to the local emergency room, slipping in and out of consciousness. 

I was given radioactive contrast dye through a shot into my veins, I was required to lay perfectly still for two hours while images of my brain from every possible angle were taken. I was pulled from the MRI machine and taken to a triage room while the images were compiled and read.

I was asleep when my parents were given the news. I had an Anaplastic Astrocytoma, there was a zero percent chance that I would live past five years. A neurosurgeon was called in immediately. He read the MRI, and his opinion was the same. I was immediately admitted into the intensive care unit, and pumped full of steroids to increase my appetite so that I would gain a bit of weight because the doctors said that I was not heavy enough for the extremely invasive surgery. 

After some time on steroids and opiates, I would not have been able to grasp the seriousness of what was actually happening to me. They also did not reveal to me my prognosis of five years until ten years later. The anesthesiologist came into the operating room, slipped a needle containing powerful anaethetics into my arm, put a gas mask over my face, and told me to count down from ten to one. I think I made it to four.
The next thing I knew, machines monitoring my heart rate and my breathing, etc. My head was shaved, and I was afraid. Nine hours had passed, and I was unaware of what had happened to me.
I was immediately aware that my body function had drastically changed while I was under. My right arm, etc.

I was in physical therapy for years afterward, as the next school year began, I had severe anxiety about going back. My right arm just did not work, and I knew that I was going to be made fun of for this.

I was right. All throughout the fourth, seventh and eighth grades I was made fun of, teased and bullied every day. I was sporadically beaten up because I was drastically different from the other children, and had a VERY visible disability. This caused me to become very withdrawn and depressed from an extremely young age. 
When I entered high school in a completely different part of the country, but was still very shy and withdrawn. I graduated high school with honors, close to being valedictorian.

I had dabbled in drugs as self-medication from a young age, PCP, Amphetamine, a plethora of prescription drugs, etc. I was in a downward spiral and really didn't care to pull myself out. 

Fast forward about ten years. My fiancé had broken things off with me and I was in a severe depression. We were still living together at this point, things only got worse. I left the horrible living situation and to avoid any more drama, I gave up my rights to anything that we had bought jointly. I gave it all to her just to avoid a fight.

I moved in with a person whom I thought was a good person, shotguns and handguns from all around the house, loading them, cocking all of them and placing them all around him on the couch. Eventually, a SWAT negotiator showed up, but they were unable to reach a mutual resolution. After a few hours of trying to reach a resolution, the negotiator gave up and told him that fully armed agents were coming in to the house with body armor. He also told my ex roommate that if he fired a shot, of course

Over the course of the breakup, I decided to cut my losses and not ask questions. Now, I am totally alone. I live alone, and due to my complex of being made fun of for several years am very shy. I also work an absolutely insane schedule, and do not have very much time at all to meet people. However, if a truly quality person or two were to step into my life, I could certainly make time for them.

I'm a university student studying science and just going through life experiencing the things any average 20 year old would. I'm not sure if it's a coincidence i picked now of all times since uni is starting back soon

I find so many things interesting in the world, i like pretty much any genre of either, ranging from classical to rap and movies like Infernal affairs to things like Eurotrip. I really enjoy learning things and i enjoy a good documentary as well.  Considering the time here (about 5AM) i am a massive night-owl. I've tried to break the habit and yet i seem to keep drifting back here, so, i'm well suited to talk to people outside my timezone.  

Probably one of my biggest interests is philosophy, i focus on philosophy of religion, so, i'm pretty big on sharing other peoples beliefs as well.  My favourite genre of music is probably symphonic metal but my music library is packed with pretty much every genre and i have a soft spot for eurovision. To relax, i like to walk through some of the nice parks we have here or go for a run, i also enjoy photography. I also like Sherlock Holmes (the novels and the current shows going on about him).

I'm Matt

I've had a somewhat interesting life, gave up owning their own house 26 years ago when their first son, my brother Brett, was announced as having Down Syndrome with a life expectancy of 18, they left and moved closer to the city to be able to have easier access to the hospital. He is currently 26, pushing that expectancy, making me worried that he is essentially on a countdown, causing the household to be very hectic, Dad lost his job in 2008 during the recession period, and went on to have an unmatched donor bone marrow transplant

Through my life experience I have been the Leukaemia Foundation's ambassador

Well a little About me : I'm a 20 year old currently living in Texas . I'm pretty shy and laid back but oddly it seems that the people I'm most comfortable around are the really talkative types . The kind of person that won't let a conversation go stale and likes to go on random tangents or keeps asking questions. I also don't mind asking all the questions if you are less than a chatter box 

I also like to draw people but I will admit I'm only somewhat decent since I still suite a long to go .( just as an example http://i.imgur.com/P14P5Ae.jpg). I also like to play games on either Xbox or pc. I particularly like fighting games such as  king of fighters 13

So, I'm a bit shy, but you probably won't see that side of me 'cause online I can be a little chatterbox :D However, I almost always prefer to be a listener whenever I can, even if I don't always know the right things to ask (what if I ask about something they don't want to talk about?! &gt;_&lt; ).

I like video games, but mostly I enjoy them with others. Cooperative games appeal to me the most. I love to talk about every day boring stuff (nothing is too boring for me, I promise!), but I don't mind discussing more abstract stuff, like math or politics or whatever. I much much much prefer to agree than to disagree, but disagreements can be okay as long as it doesn't get heated. Really, we're just two people, your fledgling romances, I'd love love love to listen :3

A little more about me: I'm a photographer, designer, graffiti artist, painter, etc and the only thing I love more than art is learning new things.

**About me**

I don't know what to say, slim, stylish, funny, adjectives. I have 0 talent in music but I love good music and dancing.  I'd like to say I can twerk it, but if the music isn't right I can be stiff.  Sometimes, you just need to feel it to work it, but I very much enjoy bands.  Most recent band to be added to my iPod was Band of Horses.  Listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar and A$AP Rocky.

I am also reading a lot more now.  Currently reading ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking and before that

This is starting to sound like I'm filling out an application so I'll just give you a run down of a typical weekday.

*Wake up. (drank).

*Coffee. (Breakfast)

*Shadow doctor in ER / Class / Research in lab

*Lunch

*Catch up on readings

*Class

*Dota 2/Reddit

*Gym / Dance studio sometimes

*Work (Read books and study)


So that's me. I am just looking for friends to go shoot the shit, and just have fun.

-------------------

After years of not having many friends, doing things, having conversations that extend beyond a few sentences, etc. If you're not in Chicago, just talking online is cool, too. 

I've been told that I'm ""shy, I think that I can be a little [zany](http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users9/dexy/default/big-pimpin-daddy--large-msg-113537718852-2.jpg), but maybe that's just me.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in English.

In college, [my photography was in an exhibition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dggEorHctA8&amp;feature=plcp). I haven't been doing much of that lately due to the cost and time commitment. I'll probably get back into it within the next few years. 

I wrote a screenplay a few years ago. I write every now and then for leisure, I'm definitely game for that.

I am [currently](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b-C4BZpO1pI/UKHaSWKXueI/AAAAAAAAAjY/OxoSXSzNxok/s439/photo.jpg) in the second year of a nursing program. I plan to work in an ICU prior before moving on to graduate studies. Working in health care has always been my goal. 

I have been working with people who have developmental disabilities for about a year. 

I am a CPR/First Aid/AED instructor. I think I'm pretty good at it.

Some of my favorite authors include Truman Capote, and Kurt Vonnegut. 

My favorite movies are *[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove)* and *[What About Bob?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_About_Bob%3F)*

I used to have a [radio show](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zN3K5faGsVI/S4YFyLEu4hI/AAAAAAAAAAM/vIbGiblgmlg/w537-h644-p-k/2010.02.11.JPG) at the University of Chicago (WHPK 88.5 FM Chicago). During that time, but the ones that I really enjoy listening to the most are [Frank Zappa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa), [Captain Beefheart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Beefheart), [Tom Waits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits), most funk, and [free jazz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_jazz). 

My favorite television show has always been [Twin Peaks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks). Currently, Breaking Bad, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. 

Every now and then, and [Delilah's](http://www.delilahschicago.com/).

Sometimes

I also like to show up in [news segments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQLSBv93m5Q&amp;feature=plcp). (3:26) Here's [one more](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKozu0igPM&amp;feature=plcp). (2:48)

I think that should about do it for now.

Anyway, that's okay, too. Shoot me a message, and I'll shoot one back. Tell me what you think. Let's ask each other questions. Let's try to keep a conversation moving beyond two messages.

I'm hoping to make a few new friends

So here's a few things about me::

~Books:: I'll read most anything. Except cheesy romance novels. . . ok, thrillers, spy/noir, murder mysteries, even conspiracy and horror. I like the occasional ""odd book"" like The Fuck Up, The Perks of Being A Wallflower.

~I love Horror. I love to scare myself. I even love B-Rated for laughs(: I scare and startle really easy but that doesn't stop me. At all. I don't really have a favorite movie

~I've found that I'm pretty nifty when it comes to making some pretty tasty treats. I love trying/baking new things and seeing what new thing I can come up with(:

~I love dogs. Especially big dogs. Something my size that will cuddle and love me to bits? YesPlease. Right now

~I love stuffed animals. Or just anything soft that I can cuddle and hold on to. It's a sort of safety blanket for me as well as just comfortable.

~I'm incredibly shy in person. I have a tendency to hide behind my hair or turn incredibly red when I first meet someone. I mumble somewhat but I'm getting better at that(: 

So tell me what you like

I'm a student in university studying physics. If you've got a similar inclination

Miscellany:

* I quite like music. I've been playing the drums for 11 years now and I sometimes like to mess around on the piano, instrumental music. Here are a couple examples of what I'm currently listening to! - [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYfQ1I-VV7M), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csBEUb_eNp8), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtQ2-5wWP8). Let me know what you think!

* I enjoy reading. I generally read fantasy

* I tend to prefer television shows to movies as I feel they allow more time for character/plot development. My list of favorites includes but is not limited to: Star Trek, Breaking Bad, Flight of the Conchords, Archer. I also watch a fair amount of documentaries. Anything regarding space is sure to pique my interest. I also enjoy the occasional episode of 'How It's Made' or the like. I did say I prefer tv shows, but that doesn't mean I don't like movies. In fact, there are a few I'm quite fond of. A few of my favorite movies: Midnight in Paris, Romantics Anonymous, and I just recently watched Shall We Kiss. I must say, I was left disappointed with that one. 

* This brings me to my next point. I'm learning to speak french. I'm not very far along, please let me know. I've been using [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com) and that's been working rather well.

* I'm not particularly athletic or knowledgeable in regards to professional sports. I've played many sports, and racquetball. 

* My personality type is INTJ.

* I enjoy playing board games and video games when I can find time in my schedule. If you're interested in playing co-op

* Information you may or may not need: I'm an atheist
 

What I'd like from you:

If you've made it to the end of this post (and enjoyed it) please post a description of yourself and your interests! Let's be friends.

I'm an **online college student with no time to venture out to meet people.** Not having a car sucks too. I have tried other subreddits

I am **mostly interested in making friends with a girl** because I currently have none. I have a boyfriend and I have some cool guy friends but the two don't mix very well. I don't have anyone to hang out with anymore. **If you are a guy and you are really interested in messaging me go ahead but please remember it is JUST FRIENDS** (reddit can be like a creepy dark alley for those who admit to having a vag.) Also, please.** I already spend 12 hours a day on the stupid computer. I can add you on facebook too.




**About Me:**

I love to text and talk on the phone. I like listening and helping with advice. I am not an extremely feminine/materialistic girl but I like shopping, baking, and talking about boys, etc. I am super empathetic and I can be very supportive. 

I do like hiking, and random drunken adventures. I have broken the law on occasion just for the bucket list. I like to party hard and I like to sit at home and do boring things. I love driving long distances. Hmm... and I like photography and looking at animals. Etc etc etcccccc.

My favorite movies are from Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill's) and Tim Burton (Big Fish). My favorite books are from Michael Crichton (Sphere or Eaters of the Dead). I don't watch TV, Xenosaga and Pokemon before.

I am in my last year of undergrad studying Microbiology. I just started volunteering at a marine science place and I do literature research for the boss as of the moment. No paying job

TV - Modern Family, It's always sunny in Philadelphia, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad. My guilty pleasure or one that I'm otherwise usually too embarrassed to admit is Desperate Housewives.

Food - ALL THE FOOD.
