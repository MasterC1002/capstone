Out of nowhere my HM2 (E-5) threw open my door and was wondering what was going on.

""Oh sorry Sir

""HM2 you dont have to worry about me.. Im squared away like sponge bob"" I replied

well... the Colonel thought that was the coolest thing he heard in a while.. so a few weeks later

She proceeds to hand me this red Marine Corps award packet and inside it was my award.

I displayed it with pride on my desk for months and got a lot of positive feedback from other officers (i was in charge of retirement physicals) until a new hotshot HM2 came to the clinic and thought ""it didnt look professional""... so i had to remove it.

If you are or plan on being a military SO/spouse or whatever

1) The military ALWAYS comes first. So acting like you are the top priority is laughable. You can be replaced and most likely will be if you act like a constant twat.

2) If you can't deal with early mornings

3) You have no say in your mans day to day at work. Don't act like you do. You have no business at his company unless you're dropping off cookies.

4) If you can't keep your fucking legs closed. Fuck you. Deployments happen. TDYs happen. VIPs happen. Get a fucking vibrator or get a divorce.

5) If your man complains about being treated badly at work chances are you're with a shitbag. Complaining to his chain of command will only make him more of a laughing stock. Shut your fucking mouth.

6) Get over yourself you're just making his life more difficult by creating issues that should never be fucking issues. STOP BEING A CONTROLLING TWAT.

For fucks sake support your man and he will in turn support you.

/end rant

*This was brought on from hearing a couple stories last night from my SO who is an NCO about a few wives who cant seem to wrap their heads around the lifestyle they married into. If this isnt a proper place for this then please let me know.

Edit: #5 is a personal rant that applies to my SOs company. I've seen it so many times in other units as well and does not apply to everyone. Didn't mean to offend.

Extra special edit: to those with their panties in a wad. This is a personal rant. It's a generalization. It does not apply to every single spouse out there and isn't aimed at anyone in particular. Being pissed at me for ranting when I clearly labeled this as a rant is just silly. To touch on male dependents. I spoke about what I know. I don't know male spouses so I didn't mention them sorry I left you guys out. I wasn't trying to be demeaning or insulting. 
Also: I'm a 30yr old with two jobs and a prior military marriage. I'm not new to this life nor am I ignorant to the exceptions out there.   ",self,t5_2qh8y,1350448041.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/11kzrx/a_rant_from_a_military_so_to_other_military_sos/

How should I follow up on something like this?,jhb2wr,392,85,467,"So I'm at the movies last night and I see some dumbass private in ACUs chilling with his friends in the theater at 2130 before the movie starts. Mind you this theater is about 40 minutes from post. Guy's got his feet all over the seats, so I got fed up and decided to correct this dude. I walk down the aisle and sit beside this dude and try to be tactful but stern about it. The exchange went something like:

Me: Hey private

Him: What?

Me: You're dead wrong right now. So what's wrong with this picture?

Him: Dude

Me: I'm a guy who's trying to give you a little professional development because *clearly* nobody's taught you that you're fucked up right now. Why are you in uniform outside of duty hours at the movie theater? Help me understand why you thought this was a good idea. 

Him: Man

Me: Let's try this a different way. I'm 1st Lieutenant Jhb2wr; what unit are you with.

Him: I don't fucking know you

Me: Do you really think that's the right answer? 

Him: *ignores me and just stares at the pre show commercials*

Me: What's your name?

Him: Pssh

Me: It only gets worse from here. Standby. 

After that I went back to my seat. Finished the movie and left. I've got his last name from his uniform, (We left at the same time). But that's all I've got. His unit patch was the same division patch that almost every swinging dick on main post has. I've never wanted to choke slap somebody so hard in my life. So here's my question. How can I follow up on this, because there's no way I'm going to let this go now. I'm planning on seeing my S1 on Monday to hunt this guy down. Any thoughts from someone who's dealt with something like this before?

Warning: I'm a Marine. I swear a lot. If that's going to hurt your precious little feelings (*looking at you


*


**Background:**

We just had a young Marine caught with female underwear he had stolen from the barracks laundry room over the course of a few months. 

Just another pervy, none of them were surprised, either. It's just kind of something you get used to.

I was taken aback, but not just him, none of the highers could deal with it. Sure, guys joked and made fun of the kid, but most of them seemed genuinely surprised that this was happening and even more so that their female counterparts were so blase about the whole thing.

*

**What's going on:**

So, that if I didn't make sure to shut my door all the way when I lived in the barracks, some drunken idiot would burst in while I was sleeping and try to climb into my bed. I've heard of male Marines getting a hold of the master key and letting themselves into females' rooms to ""talk"" or ""hang out"" or whatever. As females, we act like it's no big deal. Nobody wants to be the uppity bitch who cries wolf. As a community, we laugh about this shit like it doesn't affect anyone.

It *is* funny, man, it's not okay. The fact of the matter is that it blows to spend every day hearing comments about who wants to fuck you, to have guys leer at the gym, to dread seeing 1stSgt because you know he'll say something weird as you're leaving and to not feel safe in your own damn room.    
I'm kind of embarrassed by how alright I've become with this nonsense... and this is just the easy stuff. I'm not even going to get into how rapey the military gets. (CMC is working on it

* 

Anyway, first of all, sometimes they're bitches or whores because they join young and don't know how to deal with this shit- they either fight back or give in. That doesn't make it okay, but we'll talk about that in a bit.  
This post is for that 1/8th of females that you're cool with. Stop thinking about that uppity, fucking think about your sister or something because you're probably going to have to deal with this shit soon enough. (Thank congress, but don't bother bitching about it here. Write another post if you're feeling a diatribe coming on. This is my soapbox, holmes.)

*The point of this is that there's a fucking problem in the military and it's not going to get any better if we don't fucking acknowledge it and talk about ways to fix it.*

**What the fuck can I do

If you have a new female in your unit, and ask them if they'll take her out during off time. Most importantly, if you hear or see some guys talking trash about all they're planning on doing with her or betting on who'll fuck her first, nip that shit in the bud. Sorry to ruin your fun, boys, but there are *plenty of other women in the world*. You don't have to dip your pen in company ink. That's just pathetic... It can't be so hard for you to get laid that you have to prey on some clueless boot, and if it is
Bonus, well, I'm writing pro-cons at this point in my career and it's hard to overlook some Marines' conduct when they're jackasses to their peers. I try to be objective, but... yeah, it's hard to overlook. 

We're brothers and sisters in arms, you can help. Be that simply being there to make sure nothing escalates or finding an excuse to get them out of their awkward conversation or whatever. 


*

Some of you may think this isn't a problem because you don't hear the females you know talk about it. We don't talk about it because a.) some people consider complaining about unwanted attention a humblebrag, but military or not, they've been harassed and molested at some point, if not constantly. I guaran-fucking-tee it.

",41,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/jgph1/in_2002_me_and_a_few_sailors_prevented_some/,"Thought you guys might like to hear about this.

In 2002 the John C. Stennis battle group was steaming towards the Middle East.  We stopped in Changi Naval Base Singapore for a few days of port call.  My duty day was the last day.  That morning when I reported to watch I pulled bus rider for 8 hours.  My watch was to ensure that everybody riding the bus from downtown Singapore had military ID and the proper sticker on their ID Card.  I could only get off the bus at the Naval base and had to stay on for the entire ride into town.  I did however get to wear civilian clothes (khaki pants with a polo shirt tucked in wearing a belt

The Bus route took us to someplace downtown where we would park for about 30 minutes and pick up Sailors and Marines.  Everybody getting on the bus had to show proper ID.

This happened at the half way point waiting for Sailors and Marines.

Middle eastern bus driver wearing full Arab garb sans Keffiyah

Me with headache needing to use bathroom and probably thirsty

For the 30 minutes we were parked

Anyways

At this point a guy tries to get on the bus.  He is dressed like any other Sailor and has a backpack

Bus driver

Me, go tell Security, cause I can't let you on.""  

Again nothing

Bus driver is quiet and starts smoking.  I remember I wanted to get off the bus and find a CDO or something but I can't

Sailors start coming back and getting on the bus.  I check all their IDs in turn.  We fill up and the bus driver takes us back to Changi.  I get off the bus and find a CDO and tell him everything.  

Angry CDO

So I confided in the other bus riders.  And they all told me that had also happened to them during their watch.  At this point we were really freaked out and told the CDO who in turn said this.  

""I can't wait to get off this watch

I remember telling all of them to make sure they don't let anybody on the bus without ID and to never leave the buses.  Also we all agreed to pass down what we had all talked about.  

We finished the last bus ride without incident and upon returning to the ship I saw the CDO talking to another Khaki doing passdown.  I remember he was angry when he saw me I actually felt embarrassed.

The next day they secured liberty and we set out to sea as normal.  I was sitting in the shop telling my shipmates about the crazy bus drivers for a while. 

We were watching CNN when it broke the headlines a few days later that something like 27 people were caught in Singapore in a foiled plot to commit terror while the John C Stennis Battle Group was in port.  All the bus drivers were arrested along with some of the security.  They confiscated maps and explosives.

No one ever came to talk to me.  I never saw any paperwork, but I was so busy working I never really had time to talk to anybody else.

Years later I tell my guys when they are on watch to be as paranoid as they want to.  

This is a throw away account

TLDR:  It's in the title.

Now first I do not get how he is a former soldier since he never got past basic. The thing that is pissing me off is that people think this guy was in for a long time and then got kicked out for saying he is gay.

During the announcement, sitting in the center seat in the row in front of me just couldn’t pause his cell phone conversation for even 30-seconds.  Stifling my growing disgust, I had to lean forward to ask him to put the phone down for a few moments to pay attention to the Captain.  Thankfully I didn’t reach forward, yank the phone from his hands and stick it “where the sun don’t shine;” but I was a good boy and only used a stern voice to admonish this loser to chill for just a moment.  Nevertheless…I almost lost it.

Subject: MRE DATE (UNCLASSIFIED)

This is long but really funny. It will have you crying.

Ever eat an MRE? You'll love this one. In fact
one even if you have to learn what an MRE is. According to the sender
from a Marine gunnery sergeant -- who should know. And this introduction
should let you know the subject matter gets pretty

The MRE Dinner Date

I had a date the other night at my place. On the phone the day before
girl asked me to cook her something she's never had before for dinner.
After many minutes of scratching my head over what to make
settled on something she has DEFINITELY

I got out my trusty case of MRE's. (Meal
when eaten in their entirety contain 3000+ calories in each meal.

Here's what I made: I took three of the Ham Slices out of their plastic
packets
Chicken-a-la-king and eight packets of dehydrated butter noodles and some
dehydrated/rehydrated rice. I cooked the Ham Slices and Pork Chops in one
pan
Chicken a-La-King
looked suspiciously like succotash. I added some spices
everything together in a glass pan that I then cooked in the oven for about
35 minutes at 450 degrees.

When I took it out, ham slices, pork chops, and a bed
of yellow ""poop"". I covered the tops of the meat in the MRE cheese (kinda
like Velveeta) and added some green sprinkly things from one of my spice
cans (hey

For dessert, added five packets
of cocoa powder
stirred it until it looked like a sort of chunky gelatinous Sh** 
sprinkled powdered sugar on top of it.. Voilaanger Pudding.

For alcoholic drinks
(yes
$4.35 per fifth at the Class Six) and mixed in four packets of ""Electrolytes
- 1 each - Cherry flavored"" (I swear
an eerie Kool-Aid with sparkles in it (that was the electrolytes I guess...
Could've been leftover sand from Egypt). 

I lit two candles

EXPENSIVE... My set of 8 place settings cost me over $600 on sale at the
Lejeune PX)

She came over
spaghetti-with-meatballs
food
food. Throughout the meal
it
fine meals.

She kind of balked at the make-shift ""wine"" I had set out
tried it I guess she liked it because she drank four glasses during dinner.
At the end of the main course
delight at the ""Chocolate mousse"" I had made. Huh? Chocolate what? Okay...
Yeah... Its Chocolate Mousse. Took me HOURS to make... Yup!

Later on
room. While she was in there
a resounding but petite fart punctuated her utterance of dismay. Let the
games begin. She sprayed about half a can of air freshener (Air Freshener
1 each
to the couch
she excused herself again
time

kinda wet, LOTS
more air freshener.

Back to the couch. She smiles meekly as she decides to sit on the chair
instead of next to me. She sits on my chair
kind of rocking back and forth slightly. Suddenly
ROCKETED up and FLEW to the bathroom
for 30 minutes.

I turned the movie up because I didn't want her to hear me laughing so hard
that tears were streaming down my cheeks. She came out with a slightly gray
pallor to her face
wrong with me. I am so embarrassed; I can't believe I keep running to your
bathroom!!"" I gave her an Imodium AD

Later on
enjoyed it so much. I calmly took her into the kitchen and showed her all
the used MRE bags and packets in the trash can. After explaining to her that
she had eaten roughly 9

She called me yesterday. Seems she couldn't shit for five days

caloric intake
unless she was PERSONALLY present and supervising.

It was a fun date. She laughed about it eventually and said that that was

To start out some facts: I served in Iraq and was returned to drill status right before the new year. I was in the wonderful city of Mosul and if any of you have been there then you know just how wonderful it was. I served with the army and would proudly do it again any day.
After coming home and returning to drilling status, I stopped talking to friends, and I basically just fell apart. My fiance was starting to get frustrated, more so then while I was gone. There was a  indentation in the couch, friends stopped talking to me out of frustration, and i was putting on weight.
My fiance finally kicked me out of the house one day and said ""Take a walk and don't come back to you have something to do""  At this point i was so depressed i didn't know what to do with myself. I started walking

1. Infantry: Snake smells them

2. Airborne: Lands on and kills the snake. 

3. Armor: Runs over snake

4. Aviation: Has Global Positioning Satellite coordinates to snake. Can't find snake. Returns to base for refuel

5. Ranger: Plays with snake

6. Field Artillery: Kills snake with massive Time On Target barrage with three Forward Artillery Brigades in support. Kills several hundred civilians as unavoidable collateral damage. Mission is considered a success and all participants (i.e.

7. Special Forces: Makes contact with snake

8. Combat Engineer: Studies snake. Prepares in-depth doctrinal thesis in obscure 5 series Field Manual about how to defeat snake using countermobility assets. Complains that maneuver forces don't understand how to properly conduct doctrinal counter-snake ops. 

9. Navy SEAL: Expends all ammunition and calls for naval gunfire support in failed attempt to kill snake. Snake bites SEAL and retreats to safety. Hollywood makes fantasy film in which SEALS kill Muslim extremist snakes. 

10. Navy: Fires off 50 cruise missiles from various types of ships

11. Marine: Kills snake by accident while looking for souvenirs. Local civilians demand removal of all US forces from Area of Operations. 

12. Marine Recon: Follows snake

13. Combat Controllers: Guides snake elsewhere. 

14. Para-Rescue Jumper: Wounds snake in initial encounter

15. Quartermaster: (NOTICE: Your anti-snake equipment is on backorder.) 

16. C-17 Transport pilot: Receives call for anti-snake equipment

17. F-15 pilot: Mis-identifies snake as enemy Mil-24 Hind helicopter and engages with missiles. Crew chief paints snake kill on aircraft. 

18. F-16 pilot: Finds snake, but get direct hit on Embassy 100 KM East of snake due to weather (Too Hot also Too Cold, Was Clear but too overcast, Too dry with Rain, Unlimited ceiling with low cloud cover etc.) Claims that purchasing multi-million dollar, high-tech snake-killing device will enable it in the future to kill all snakes and achieve a revolution in military affairs. 

19. AH-64 Apache pilot: Unable to locate snake

20. UH-60 Blackhawk pilot: Finds snake on fourth pass after snake builds bonfire

21. B-52 pilot: Pulls ARCLIGHT mission on snake

22. MinuteMan Missile crew: Lays in target coordinates to snake in 20seconds

23. Intelligence officer: Snake? What snake? Only four of 35 indicators of snake activity are currently active. We assess the potential for snake activity as LOW. 

24. Judge Advocate General (JAG): Snake declines to bite

25. Signal: Tries to communicate with snake...fail repeated attempts. Complains that the snake did not have the correct fill or did not know how to work equipment a child could operate. Signal Officer informs the commander that he could easily communicate with the snake using just his voice. Commander insists that he NEEDS to video-conference with the snake, bitches, and takes credit. In the end, General Dynamics and several sub-contractors make a few billion dollars, the 2 smart people get out and go to work for them, and the commander gets what he asked for only in fiber-optic based simulations. The snake is forgotten.

Taylor, USCG  
Date of Action: 9 December 2003  
Date of Award: 12 March 2004  
  
Lieutenant TAYLOR is cited for heroism on 9 December 2003 while serving as aircraft commander of HH-65B helicopter CG 6523 during the rescue of two survivors from the S/V JA'DA, the crew encountered 45-knot winds and 15-foot seas exacerbated by heavy rainsqualls. Lieutenant TAYLOR flew to the last known position of the distressed vessel and located the 27-foot sailboat helplessly adrift and violently pitching and rolling in the heavy seas. Unable to establish communications, the crew delivered a hand-held radio, by which--in broken English--the two survivors revealed they were sinking and pleaded to be rescued from their vessel. Despite numerous hoist attempts, the sailing vessel's instability and rigging precluded any type of basket hoist. Confronted with a sinking boat and no other reasonable rescue alternative, Lieutenant TAYLOR recommended to the survivors to enter the water for rescue basket recovery. After the successful hoist of one survivor, the second survivor's flotation device was swept away by the wind-whipped waves. Overcome by fatigue and unable to climb into the rescue basket or return to the sailing vessel, Lieutenant TAYLOR determined to rescue the otherwise vanquished survivor, Lieutenant TAYLOR grabbed the victim and with all his remaining strength

As a private I was never invited to lunch or dinner by a senior NCO or officer yet I seem to see most females with an E6 or higher. Military baring seems to be relaxed when dealing with superiors. 

From what I've seen the living conditions

It seems there are cases where leaders are afraid to punish or discipline females because of the blowback from a harassment or EO claim. 

Let's be honest

I don't believe pregnancy should be a factor in a service members term of service. Becoming a father is a life changing event and we don't allow males to leave because of it. Women are put on light duty and removed from deployment requirements

A MUCH lower of risk of seeing actual combat. I believe the average percentage of KIA who are female is around 2%. 

So these are the things coming off the top of my head. I would like to have an honest conversation

Fast forward to now

What I'm saying here is I've been here a lot trying to join.

 I don't know if I could have gotten through this process of joining without you guys' advice, I want to give something back. Reading /r/military I noticed that several questions come up repeatedly, usually focused on eligibility, recruiter, job selection, DEP, and Basic Training. Over the last three years I've been bookmarking threads and sites related to these areas of questions

**Joining the Military**

**Which Branch is right for me? I am a ______________.""**

There are several opinions on this answer, and types of deployments. Regarding quality of life, it is generally agreed on this subreddit that Air Force has the highest, followed by the Navy, then Army and Marines. I haven't seen any discussions on life in the coast guard, but comments below may help. 

Regarding deployment, etc. etc. However, deployments will have much more to do with your job than your branch. A marine in certain jobs may deploy less than an Air Force combat controller, for example. Please do not think that there is any *safe* branch to join, including the coast guard.

Regarding types of jobs, Army and Marines have more combat oriented jobs. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. 

In the last couple of months

[Which branch is right for this guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/ijkso/need_help_deciding_which_branch_to_enlist_in/)

[I'm 29

[I want to be an officer

[I want to fly like one of the Guardian owls of Legend

You may also wish to research each branch's website or about.com's website for each branch

[Army](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/army/United_States_Army.htm)

[Air Force](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforce/United_States_Air_Force.htm)

[Marines](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marines/United_States_Marines.htm)

[Coast Guard](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/coastguard/United_States_Coast_Guard.htm)

**I want to join the military

When you've talked to a recruiter and you are sure you want to join, take a medical history, and perform a height and weight check. About.com has a website that can answer most questions about eligibility, including height, weight, age, ""moral standards"", etc. It's linked here.

[Eligibility for enlistment](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/joiningthemilitary/a/enlstandards.htm)

**I don't fit the above standards

Maybe. No one here can tell you for sure, who you are, what your other qualifications are, and a million little other things. However, waivers are granted, and are granted often. Don't lose hope, work with a recruiter

** I'm ready to talk to a recruiter

Maybe. Think of recruiters as car salesmen. They will tell you enough truth about the car, at the end of the day their job is to bring you in. Some advice that's been given here if you want to check on things your recruiter said: do a search here, or of the internet. Call a recruiter in another area of your state and ask them. If both of those things fail, feel free to post here and ask others.

**BASIC TRAINING**

There have been many discussions on basic, Marines, Navy, or Coast Guard. Here's some links on those.

[Here's a comment on BCT that has generally been upvoted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/h6aaa/leaving_for_bct_in_9_days/c1swehu)

Here's a [blog](http://bankingtobootcamp.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2010-11-22T08%3A08%3A00-06%3A00&amp;max-results=700) that was kept for one person's day to day experience at BCT at Ft Jackson

Each training location also has a website relating to training there. They are

**AIR FORCE**

Air Force Basic Military Training for enlisted is all done at Lackland Air Force Base in sunny San Antonio Texas. Here's some [advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/id23s/leaving_to_af_in_40_days_looking_for_some_advice/) from here but make sure you check out about.com's excellent guide to Air Force BMT

[LACKLAND AFB](http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/airforcejoin/a/afbmt1.htm)

Make it into Air Force OTS? You lucky son of a bitch. Here's some info on [that](http://www.afoats.af.mil/OTS/BOT/index.asp)

**NAVY**

Ah, according to some seamen.

Make navy OCS? [Here's a documentary on that.](http://www.projo.com/extra/2008/ocs/)

**MARINES**

You guys will ship based on where you live. west of Lake Michigan goes to San Diego

Here's a guide to [surviving](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marinejoin/a/marinebasic.htm) your training

**Coast Guard**

Coast guard does one location for training
](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/cgjoin/l/aacgbasic1.htm) which should answer many questions.

Hopefully this should answer your frequently asked questions /r/military, and again, and again.

Thanks again, so I'll update this with more frequently asked questions as they are suggested.

**You guys rock.**

1338522452.0,uf2xp,The Day I Decided To Kill Myself,cookie-cutter,187,26,50,"In September of 2009 I was a fresh faced and naive specialist on my very first tour of the big

Prior to heading out I was a young man from a small town who was chasing an American Dream of sorts. I pictured myself as this glorious super-soldier who aspired to be the Audie Murphy of my generation, ""SPC. Cookie-Cutter your unit is getting deployed, being that you're in college you aren't required to go (I was in the Army National Guard at the time) but if you were so inclined I know they could use an extra set of boots on the ground..."" Well that settled it. They wanted me to go, they NEEDED me to go, they wanted me to act as a force for good and go live out all of those glorious moments I had seen in my head since I was a kid. ""I'm in.""

Flash forward to 7 months in country; I am sitting alone in a dark room

I was getting deployed so I did what any young All-American young man would do

The wife and I would email fairly frequently and we had the occasional phone call but the contact became less and less frequent to the point where the only time we were really talking was when she wanted me to transfer money into her account ""for school"" (she was a college student at the time) or ""for gas"" or something like that. I was more than happy to provide for her and did what I saw to be my husbandly duty. When I would ask her to start chatting more frequently she woud say she'd been busy and she was so sorry and then set up a time for a phone call or the rare Skype session and then miss it with claims of how busy she got and restart the whole cycle. This had me fairly down but I threw myself at work and started counting down the days

Then came the day she made one of our phone call appointments. ""I'm not happy,500 to pay for it."" I was in total shock (I shouldn't have been but I was rather dumb at the time) and couldn't do anything more than stutter and say ""Uh...okay."" I didn't tell any of my unit what happened, I couldn't, I didn't know how. I was this young ""hot shot"" that was the ideal soldier, young, tough, hardcore and bullet proof. I worked through my shift

Like I said, the missing the phone calls, all of it. She was cheating on me (later confirmed) and I was powerless to do anything. I wasn't angry, I was just sad. I had failed to be a good husband and had no one close to me to talk to about it. I was alone, 9000 miles from home, in a dark room, ""depressed"" and with a loaded gun in my mouth. A bad combination to say the least. 

I've learned that the most dangerous thing in the world is a kid with a gun but I never realized this is true in cases of potential suicide. I almost did it

There once was this kid in Iraq
Who got too much sand in his crack.
When Sarge yelled
and then friction began
and now he's got burns on his back.

Not very funny but it had me in stitches. I had to share this silly thing I created with someone

Point of the story: In my young and seemingly lonely state I allowed myself to almost make some insane decisions. I've since made up with my mom, keep going for it. ",,False,self,t5_2qh8y,False,,
