EDIT EDIT: I didn't expect anywhere near this level of response - I've made one or two edits for clarity's sake.

Context: I teach Grade 8 (13-14 years old) in Ontario, and I am teaching something of a ""tough"" class. 

In particular, have gotten in fights, etc. There is one boy in this group (he will be known here as Harry) who is a little quieter than the others, but very popular. He’s a bit tough to get close to, and seems like the type to be resistant to new ideas and different people. He hangs out with another tough kid (let’s call him Mark), who is loud and boisterous and often rude.

Now that it’s so close to the end of the year, and if it’s appropriate, I play it. So this morning, Harry comes up to me and says, “I have a video I want to play.”

Now, them’s the rules. 

“I really want to show it

Given what Harry listens to, but I’ve heard some non-school-appropriate language come out of the music he listens to. So I ask him if it’s appropriate for school; he tells me yes. 

This kid is many things

(Note: I did read the lyrics

So he goes on over and pulls it on up, and about standing up in the face of hatred and homophobia. “Same Love,” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. The video was beautiful. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0.

And there’s Harry, lonely life culminating in a fabulous wedding. Harry. My “tough kid.”

The video finishes, and he says to me, “I told you you’d like it.”

And then his loud

The whole class applauded again – for me this time – and then I cried. I cried the proudest tears I have ever shed. 

Harry and Mark… they might tick off every teacher they ever have

tl;dr: Tough kid in my class showed a music video whose message is to stand up against homophobia


Important Questions Answered:

- Yup
- I told my kids I was gay for a few reasons
Having said that, I'm a Canuck. 
- To the idea that my sexuality is my own business
- No, really. I HAD heard of the Thrift Shop song but I hadn't listened to it. I sometimes avoid things that are over-hyped.
- ""Pink Day"", but they went ahead and wore the pink bandanas I brought in!
- My school/school board is in a very multicultural area of the province; there are a lot of immigrants from south Asian and middle-eastern countries, though it isn't a high Christian-evangelical population, it isn't a giant left-wing backyard either.
And of course, and I love teaching it. Talk about learning a lot!
- As for the controversy surrounding this song in a classroom down south (south of me
... because honestly this isn't the most controversial thing I've done by a longshot. A few months ago I had a trans* guest speaker come in and talk about his experience to two different homeroom classes

Thank you for the commentary everyone! Much love!

This same christmas

When it came to gift opening, and tvs and laptops, all I got from my family were very manly gifts that I so hated, like tuxedos and shoes (which were donated the next day to a charity for people who need them), and saw that nobody gave a crap about it despite me being super sad about it, everyone was too busy looking at their gifts, I gave my niece a wii with like 3 games and she loved it.

Anyway, and I was still supper bummed out but hiding it well. When everyone went to do their own thing, between playing with their gifts or just talking, my niece tugged on my pants when nobody was looking and asked me to follow her quietly, I thought she was bringing me to play wii with her, but she dragged me upstairs to her room, and she asked me to close the door behind me

Right now I'm staring at her, takes out a bunch of her clothes out and takes out 3 tiny boxes and hands them to me. 

I open them and they're really really cute earrings

An officer and a Brilliant man are both hospitalized after getting hit by a car Christmas night.

On Wednesday night, told Natalie Herbick his side of the story.

Starcher faced a judge Wednesday on charges connected to the investigation, James Coil, feared for their lives.

""Christmas was a bad day that day. We were taking a walk to take a breather

Just after 10 p.m. on Christmas night

""He asked, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'Nothing,'"" Starcher said. ""He said, 'Well, what's your name?' And I said, 'I'm not sure if I should give you that. Why do you want it?' And that's when he jumped out of the car.""

Starcher said the officer started swearing and got in their faces.

Wells Township police said OfficerJ.J. Kamerer only had intentions of lending a helping hand but sensed confrontation and merely wanted identification. Police said Coil threw a prescription bottle at the officer's face.

""He didn't throw the pill bottle at him

At that point

""Jimmy started to mouth off. I mouthed off a little

Police said Kamerer chased the men on Third Street in Brilliant. Starcher said he never ran

""I heard the officer running into the road screaming, and when the car backs up, there's Jimmy laying in the road.""

Coil is in critical condition in a Pittsburgh hospital. Starcher said neither of them wanted to start any problems

""He's never done anything to anyone

Starcher pleaded no contest in court and was found guilty of obstructing official business and failure to disclose one's personal information. He is set to be sentenced on Jan. 11.

Officer Kamerer is in Wheeling Hospital with a serious leg injury. NEWS9 will make sure his side of the story is heard once he is ready to speak.

I ended up telling him that I'd seen him in the park with a guy and that I just wanted him to know that if he was gay or straight or bisexual or whatever else that I didn't care and I love him just the same. I said I was sorry if he felt like I was invading his privacy

He just looked like he was in shock for a minute, which he's planning to do next weekend. We talked for a while longer then went and told my girlfriend together, who immediately burst into tears and gave him a big hug.

Since I was young I knew that I was bisexual.  I was a ""straight acting"", but nothing more than experimentation kind of things.  After highschool I started dating a girl and fell in love.  I thought that I would marry her and my latent questions about my sexuality were essentially moot.  After 3 years together, she introduced me to her gay friend from school, who I'll call Eric.  The moment I saw him (which I remember vividly), I got butterflies in my stomach, instant attraction.  We became friends but I never thought that anything more would come of it.

Eric being a young, went to a male strip club on an ""amateur night"" where he won the contest and got offered a job.  Not knowing my status, my girlfriend thought it would be an awesome idea to go to his club one night and check it out.  I, of course, didn't put up much of a fight haha.  The next weekend I somehow suggested going back without raising any suspicion from my GF ;).  He was only there for maybe 2 or 3 months before the creepy old guys weren't worth the easy money anymore and he quit, but I was secretly fantasizing a lot by this point.

Before college the next year my girlfriend and I decided to move in together.  However, my girlfriend got cold feet and we ended up breaking up over it.  Eric and I moved in together and over the course of a few months, we became best friends.  I knew that I was attracted to him, but I struggled with actually pursuing anything because I had always told myself that while I *was* bisexual, I would just limit myself to women.  I figured that it would be easy, like cutting out blondes for a straight guy.  This worked for a few months until one night when we were both pretty drunk and ended up passing out on the couch.  I don't know what came over me, but I couldn't help myself anymore and decided that if I didn't make a pass now

Looking back now, I don't want to get into an emotional relationship, just sex"".  To which he responded ""Sounds great!"" (typical XD).  

The next 10 months were very complicated for me.  Eric would periodically spend the night in my room, and that would cause me to try and create space between us.  Eventually I decided that I couldn't do it anymore.  I *was* getting emotionally involved and it wasn't fair to Eric to tie him up in my issues, so I cut it off.  We both eventually started dating other people (mine was a girl), and our friendship got very strained due to a lot of jealousy on both sides.   We had emotional fights and I slowly realized that I was in love with him.  After those 10 months, I decided: screw what anyone else thinks, I'm not going to give up a loving relationship just because some person I don't even know might judge me.  I told him I loved him, he told me too.

I told my friends, I love them so much).  I told my parents, who were just as stunned but less accepting.  That was 7 years ago.  We're still together and *very* happy.  My parents have come around and are not only accepting but are now *embracing*, which is freakin' awesome.  We have a dog who we love and while we don't live in a state where gay marriage is legal, I think we'll spend the rest of our lives together. 

So yeah, but it's been *so* rewarding and it breaks my heart to think that I was so close to throwing it away.

Here's the email he sent me at 4:30a this morning...

&lt;email&gt;

Evan
 
I felt that i needed to write something to you now.
 
I'm absolutely shocked about this. Frankly i've suspected it for a long time since you've shown no interest in girls. I'm still bothered about your lack of interest in &lt;girl&gt;&lt;/girl&gt; at the prom. That was a marrying girl and you should have kept her.
 
Anyway, i dont care who else is gay or how fashionable it is now. All i know is that i've lost a son to this madness.
 
Recall that prior to this news i had a lot of issues with you over the past three months. You are selfish, thoughtless, untrustworthy and a chronic liar. And ad to that this madness of agnotisism. In my book all that adds up to a bad person who is going to Hell. You've become like someone whom i dont like at all. I told Mom weeks ago that i didnt want to have any Father's Day since the last three years have been so very disappointing. I was very reluctant to come over this time, but i pushed ahead. It was very uncomfortable sitting there with you trying to make small talk with you. You've become like a stranger to me and I feel that you are lost in a wilderness.
 
I do not approve of the way in which you behave or live your life. You've made nothing but bad mistakes since high school and cost me thousands of dollars and much pain and heartache to the point where i had to push away from you for my own safety. I stayed in a loveless sexless marriage with your mother for years just to give you a normal childhood and homelife. You OWE me more than this.
 
You say you ""love"" me. Love is not just a word. It's the most serious word in our world and must be proven with good deeds. You havent done one thing to show me that love in a long long time. All you've done is disappoint me and hurt me. Your mother selfishly cheated me out of more children. I wish i had a back up kid to make up for you.  Now you've selfishly cheated me out of having grandchildren.  I deserve more than this. I never put any demands on you. I never insisted that you join the band or go to law school or be ""like me"". I let you blossom into you. But I'd rather you married, and if need be then satisfied your aberrant lust in private, like a gentleman.
 
I never want to meet your boyfriend. And frankly
 
I'm still your father
 
But
 
I'm very hurt, starting with your family. What you've done is wrong. You need to re-think this. You need to re-think a lot of things. Apparently my wishes and advice have no meaning to you. I've run out of things to say to you.
 
So for now
 
Dad
 
&lt;/email&gt;

*******************************

I know it's a bit douchey of me to say, things to make you think, laugh, I know we're not all the same and don't all share the same interests, but is anyone else getting a bit annoyed of the front page of this subreddit being flooded with pictures of people just because they happen to be Gay/Lesbian/Transgender? 

Some of it is legit. Like a wedding photo here and there or a cool story to go along with the pic. Lately though

If anyone is looking to actually meet people in their area or see what people think of their pictures there is always [r/q4q](http://www.reddit.com/r/q4q). There is also [r/AmIUgly](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly), and [/r/lgbtaww](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbtaww) if anyone wants feedback on their pictures. I'm just not believing that some sexy person posting their face pic is really just to ""introduce"" themselves more than whore attention. Really am sorry for being so harsh, but I know we can take it. 

**Edit**: Kinda getting hated on by some people for bringing this up. I'm not going to respond to many more comments here but I'm not going to delete this thread as there seem to be a ton of people who agree that the pictures are getting to be a bit much. It's easier/quicker to stop something you don't like by saying something about it rather than waiting it out. This site is obviously very democratic

********************************

I messaged the mods about this and after some discussion they have decided to add another link or so to the sidebar which is more open to these kinds of pics. Keep in mind

Thank you to everyone who supported or discussed the current submission trend and no hard feelings to those that lost their tempers (including me on some of these comments). I really just hope that we can see a trend of more detailed submissions than simple self posts with next to no explanations.

I guess this started around when I was 11, I just didn't find them appealing. I didnt understand it so I thought I was weird, I tried to convince myself some guy was hot, but in reality I didnt care. Instead of finding Justin Bieber and such hot, I was more interested in Emma Watson. I grew more and more attracted to girls, I thought I was a freak and just kept it bottled up until a week ago.

I really wanted to talk to someone about it, so I went to my priest.

Im a Catholic

 he's never said anything about homosexuality before, for ages, and it was awesome. He was so accepting and supportive. He kept stresssing how theres nothing wrong with me, how its perfectly natural and that God loves everybody, regardless of sexuality. The conversation made me feel a million times better, and much more comfortable about myself and less like a freak :)

im not sure why im posting this

I understand how upsetting it was for you when I blinked mildly in surprise and said I was here with my husband. I know it was a shock to your system

1) As a general rule we don’t walk around with big signs around our neck proclaiming our sexuality. No scarlet letters

2) We do not generally assume that everyone within 5 feet of us must also be homosexual – it was nice of you to immediately reassure me that you are hetero

3) Homosexuality is not infectious. While I am sure you meant no disrespect with your hasty departure; in the future you can rest assured that taking a few extra seconds in your mad dash for safety will not result in you being turned gay. It will however keep you from destroying expensive vases and knocking over senior citizens. 

4) This next one may come as a surprise; but you are not, being in the same room with a straight man does not cause a gay man to instantly lose all common sense and basic common courtesy. Though I am not so sure about the reverse. 

5) Homosexuals in general get a little irked when people treat us like some sort of leper. Rushing to another mutual friend of ours and advising him of my sexuality

6) Upon being told (by said mutual friend) to stop being an idiot and that you were not my type anyway… it generally confuses the issue when you then proceed to become upset that I DON’T find you attractive. Three seconds ago you were running through a crowd of people with your hands cupped protectively over your junk as if I might attack you at any moment with a blowjob. See hint number 4. 

7) We homosexuals have an odd sense of humor – I can’t help that. Something about watching you freak out as if all the demons of hell were after you just struck me as vastly amusing. 

8) While being pissed at me for dissolving into uncontrollable laughter might be understandable… gathering a couple guys together to “teach the fag a lesson” is not. 

9) You might also want to drink a little less and be a little more careful about the guys you approach for your little proto-hate-mob. 

10) Assuming the two tall muscle-bound bruisers must be uber-hetero and just as appalled by my presence as you was your first mistake. It was an understandable one though. How were you to know that pflag tshirt the first guy was wearing wasn’t a sports team? Also the rainbow ring the second guy was wearing could have meant anything I am sure. 

11) In retrospect I suppose that upon hearing your not very subtle hate-talk and seeing who you were heading for; I could have said something instead of just laughing harder. I apologize for that. I should have just introduced you to my husband instead of letting you walk up to him and ask him if he wanted to help you teach “that fag over there” a lesson.

link to original: [I came out to my parents

I am doing this from my main account because I don't care anymore. Sorry it's a novel, but it just came to a head and was unavoidable. 

The plan for the summer was for me to move back in with my parents in and work full time at a bakery. Things were tense all month as I had started meeting guys that I could go out to the local clubs with and dance and have a few drinks. Of course I just told my parents I was going to see a late movie or going to friends' houses. But my mom knew something was up, so we were all in the same place. Things happened that caused my mom to break, and started accusing me of hiding things, and why was I so protective of my phone, and on and on. So my mom and dad and I sat down in my living room and I came out to them. My dad was furious, started yelling at me; my mom nearly fainted, was crying and the last thing she said before she left was, and you stay away from (my sister)."" 

Within literally 17 minutes of them leaving, blocked my on facebook, my cell phone was deactivated, and they had left with my paycheck which I was going to use as a deposit for a new apartment. I used facebook to communicate with some friends a little older and much more established than me in a bigger city about an hour away. They told me to grab as much valuable stuff as I could and come down and stay with them for the night. I did, and they were angels. The next day I went back to my house to finish moving my stuff, I found my parents had come back and taken a lot of my stuff. They have half of my clothes, my jeans and summer stuff, but I don't know if I would feel comfortable going back anyways) It was devastating to see that they were trying to hurt me like that. I came back to my friends in the City and they have just been incredible, looking for job, and I know she would have been fine with it

EDIT 1: I just woke up and saw the incredible love and support you guys are giving me, OK. Thank you guys, y'all are incredible.

EDIT 2: I need to explain the whole job/stolen paycheck thing a little. I worked for a bakery in Tulsa that was owned by a precious friend of the family (went to hs with my mom). I had both mine and my sister's paychecks in my backpack, but long story short, I repeatedly said that I had not quit (just in case so I would have legal protection behind me), but she ended with I have to respect your mom's request (this is how scarily controlling my mom can be). Next morning I get a call on friend's phone saying after talking with her business partners, they can't fire me because that would be discrimination (smart). So I technically still have a job there, but I really don't want to go back to Tulsa at all, I need to leave that behind me. 
I did ask her to cancel my paycheck and reissue it

EDIT 3: Just wanted to give y'all a quick update because each and every one of you has been so kind to me, I really could use my jeans, shorts, and t-shirts they have, but those are really the only things I need back. Not sure how I am going to go about that one. I don't want any contact with them, but I'll figure it out. Not entirely enthusiastic about bringing the police into it. I have sent messages out to my sister's friends asking them to pass along the message. We'll see if that happens. I also got in touch with the local PFLAG and they are going to pass my resume around to see if I can't get a job. It's starting to come together nice and steadily. I will feel so much better once I have a job. Thanks again guys :)",,,,

Let me start with this. My mom is, and considers many things that have happened in her life a blessing. She's very Christian, I suppose. She said that if she was at gunpoint, and told recant her belief in God, she would be dead.


Anyways, which was VERY risky (I'm in Utah, the chances rise significantly), because organized religion is TOTALLY against that, and about 80% of the time, they're usually kicked out of their house and not allowed back in the family. It's happened to two of my friends already.


So, that she removed the jesus fish off the back of our car. I asked her why.
I was like ""Did you do something against your beliefs? Or are you an atheist now?"" I knew she was very big on her beliefs

What she started telling me just absolutely blew me away. She said it was ridiculous that organized religion is being used as a weapon nowadays, you have to dress a certain way, and meet in a certain building, and only specific people are allowed to worship god. She said Christians are supposed to love EVERYONE, no matter how they dress, their position in society, all that jazz. She said she was embarassed and offended about how Christians act nowadays, when I came out to her two months ago

Now, but I still respect that almost more then anything she's ever decided to do. I feel like she's become a martyr in her beliefs for the good of them, and in Utah, which is so organization-based that it's practically a cult, is just fantastic to hear. I'm so grateful for that.



One of those friends that was kicked out was a good friend of our family

SON
One dad puts his foot down about his son's sexual preference.....

I was a college professor for many years. One day one of my students, and had known he was gay since he was 11, but that he could not tell his parents. I got him into contact with a support group on campus and a good counselor.

At the mid-year he went home for Christmas with plans to tell his parents.

His mom was very understanding and let him know that she had pretty much known for years

This was his Sophomore Year. For the remainder of that year and into the next  he did not go home. He saw his mom and a sister every now and then. I did not see a lot of him senior year. He was very busy with internships etc.

Then come a the graduate honors banquet. He was being honored. I was astounded to see him setting at a table with his boyfriend AND both of his parents

Later I got my former student aside and asked him what was up. He said that at Thanksgiving earlier in the academic year

It was not an easy afternoon but they made it. My student and his boyfriend drove down and back the same day. At Christmas

Dad grit his teeth and accepted the situation.

On New Years Day, the dad made a toast to the two of them.

The son looked up and asked: ""I thought the door only swung in one direction?"" His dad grinned back and said: ""It did. So I got a new door.""

We assumed he's gay, which is NOT a problem in this house, and dropped a few pro-LGBT comments here or there. We figure that, if he is gay, he'll come out when he's ready.

Yesterday he came home from school in tears. I asked him what was wrong, wouldn't say exactly what happened to spark it but I assume some kind of bullying occurred. Today,  he was much calmer but he asked again about ""ex-gay"" therapy.

But the point I'm making is that through pretending it doesn't happen, it not only lets them perhaps think that what they are doing is OK, I imagine casual homophobia and transphobia would practically disappear overnight.

****


A few nights ago my roomates received a phone call from someone reading off our home ip and address claiming intent to burn down our house

The people who were kind enough to take me in and employ me however have plenty to lose and it isnt ethically right for me to endanger others because of how i moderate [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) . So after a long discussion with rmuser on the matter I decided it was best to step down as moderator for the safety of my friends. 

However I would like to make clear that the people against my style of moderation have won absolutely no victory here as my replacement is an even more radical transfeminist than me. My good friend [RobotAnna](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobotAnna) will be taking over for me

I have full faith and confidence in her ability to crack down on transphobia, sexism and racism and i will give her any advice and tips on moderation she is willing to listen to so the day to day operation of the subreddit should not change at all, this space is still safe for any marginalized group and the only people who have anything to fear are those who are bigoted. 

To the people who threatened my roomates and the people who have been spreading my personal information around reddit and other channels and the people allowing these things to happen i really hope it was worth it to you, and you destroyed your own cause with this extremism, this doesn't make you the hero, it makes you a fucking terrorist and everyone who supported you and helped you get my new address is supporting real life terroism. I want you to think long and hard about what you have done and ask yourself if it was worth it. I want you to think and ask yourself if it was worth the lives of other sapient human beings to get your way, though of course people like you have made it crystal clear you don't consider me a human being as many of you have repeated over and over, you like to think I am worse than Hitler when you are the ones who wanted to kill for your ideals, you are no better than the religious extremists who bomb abortion clinics or crash planes into skyscrapers. I see no moral difference between the ones who wished me harm and those who supported them

To the people of this community who have supported me I want to say thank you for all of your kind words and loving support and I ask you to show the new moderator the same respect and love you have shown me, or brothers and sisters die every day because of transphobia and bigotry and I will not rest until this has stopped so if people think they have heard the last of me, they are sadly mistaken. I will fight to my last breath for all of you and they will have to kill me to shut me up. 

In conclusion [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) will continue the set policies without me and they will simply be enforced by someone more anonymous than me. I will continue to post and comment in the subreddit and report posts as a normal user and continue to make suggestions for improvement and offer css code to the mod team

We are close family friends with another family who are like my own family.  The three adult sons are like my younger brothers

We were at this family's house for Thanksgiving

I went by her house recently to pick up some presents I'd had delivered there for my kids.  In conversation, but I hope she will.""
The mother of the family, firmly stated, ""ShellBell, I need to tell you something.  You *CANNOT* use Bodelia's name or refer to *him* (yes, she said ""him"") as ""her"" or ""she"" here at Christmas Eve, for the sake of my granddaughters.""  
I was pretty stunned.
""You can't do it.  You *CAN NOT* do it.  My granddaughters don't understand
I'm still speechless and rather stunned.  I finally reply with
Mom2: ""I understand that. But you just can't do it.  Talk about *him* all you want
She also casually asked

I was stunned and REALLY pissed

So, and one of them stated that although they don't ""agree"" with our decisions re: Bodelia and her transition, they still love and support us. That's cool, I get it; and thank you for continuing to love us regardless of your personal opinions.  They all thought their Mom was nuts. One even said, ""Wow, what a punch to the face!""
One of the sons then said

So, and that they would go ahead and do that, not foreseeing any issues.

So, ""No.  You will *not* stay home on Christmas Eve by yourself. That is not an option.  We all go, or we all stay home. And we're staying home.""

I'm not planning on telling Mom2 until 3 days before Christmas so as not to mess up her meal planning, phone calls, IMs and emails, which she tends to do late at night.
It just makes me heartsick that someone I've loved my whole life, and recognize the errors in her thinking.  But it kills me as a mother to know that my daughter is that rejected.  BTW, my dad doesn't accept it either, but we really could give a shit because he's a neo-con nut job anyway and it's easier to overlook.

So
(*EDIT for formatting)

UPDATE: 12/17 2:56 pm
I've never really experienced Reddit love until today.  I was surprised to wake up this morning and see all the comments and advice, thanks to all of you.  I do think I'm going to go ahead and draft a message to Mom2 to let her know sooner than later.  I do think regardless, we're sitting this one out this year.  I have made it clear to the sons/sisters-in-laws that I'd like for them to drop by my house on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  I'll make that clear to Mom2 as well.  My biological mother also wanted me to make it clear on here that I wasn't talking about HER, and that she's not the one with the problem.  She's not.  When I first told her about Bodelia's identification, her response was, ""You mean I could've been shopping for a girl this whole time?!""  I'll update this post with new developments as they develop.  Thanks for all of your positivity.  It is vastly appreciated.

UPDATE 12/17 4:25pm
This is the letter I drafted and sent to Mom2 today.  I've not heard back from her.

&gt;""Mom2
&gt;I’ve given some thought to what you said to me the other day. I have to tell you also

&gt;It seems as if Bodelia’s presence at Christmas Eve is problematic or that it will make people uncomfortable.

&gt;I simply cannot comply with your desire for me to avoid using her name or her correct gender pronouns of “her” and “she”.  Furthermore, although the name use is harder for me and I’m only sitting at about 50%.  The boys are having a hard time with the name use as well.

&gt;The reason I’m not able to comply with your wishes is that, she’s a girl with a penis, but it’s what her brain is about, not what her parts happen to be.  She feels like a girl. She identifies as a girl. She is getting medical treatment to facilitate her outward presentation to more nearly match her inner self-concept.  I’m so happy that I have a relatively healthy child. She’s the happiest she’s been since she was 11 years old, and you know the twisting, torturous path we’ve walked the past five years.  My daughter is gaining confidence like she has never possessed before. And all of it is due to recognizing and owning her true self.

&gt;No, she’s not cutting herself, she’s not in a hospital and she’s happy, or well on her way to happiness.  I have her, instead of a tombstone or a child committed to a hospital. Because that’s the direction we were headed.

&gt;So, pretty upset, Bodelia offered, quite generously, to stay home and suggested we go without her.  I bluntly told her, “You are not staying home by yourself on Christmas Eve. Not happening!”

&gt;I love the grace that my daughter is developing, she’s going through her second puberty, and estrogen is a bitch. So, we don’t always get along.  But, she knows that I have her back.  I will stand beside her, as I have, for as long as I am alive.

&gt;So, and whether it’s something that shouldn’t be further discussed with your boys and their wives for future situations.  If you’ve not discussed it with them, I suggest you do. In my discussions with your boys and daughters-in-law, it doesn’t seem to be that big of an issue.  Of course, I’m always available as a resource if you, they or the grandkids have questions.

&gt;I also hope that you and Dad2 will swing by on Christmas Day.  Because

&gt;As I respect your wishes in this matter, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (and Transgender)) started in the new year, I’d like to invite you to one of our meetings.  Our goals are to educate, advocate and support the LGBT community.  We will be having faith panels, and general group sessions to accomplish these goals.  We will welcome anyone who is having difficulty with dealing with a friend or family member who is LGBT, or who simply has questions.  I’m on the leadership team to help re-start the chapter here in our hometown. 

&gt;I hope you understand what I am trying to say here.  I really don’t want to have multiple conversations back and forth about this. Thanks for listening.

&gt;Love
ShellBell""


UPDATE 12/21/2012: So to update, and asked her how else was I supposed to take it?
She apologized profusely.  Stated that she hadn't slept much the night that she read it, etc.  That she loves me as her daughter and that she would never purposely do anything to hurt me or my children.  She asked if she could apologize to Bodelia, and I told her certainly.  She then asked what she should say in her apology.  
/Facepalm
I told her she'd have to come up with that herself
So, and how important it is to validate Bodelia as the young woman she is.  It also updated all the sons/daughters-in-law and grandchildren about where Bodelia is in transition; and that she clearly prefers female pronouns and her name.  So, while we've not completely decided about Christmas Eve, we at least have reconciliation.

Here's my train of thought. My eliminating the word marriage from domestic union laws we:

1) Remove any religious connotation (the word marriage has religion attached to it

2) Destroys any 'separate but equal' ideas by forcing everyone to have civil unions

This would only work if civil unions get bumped up to grant the same rights that marriages currently get (but this would be a forced occurrence if civil unions begin to replace the legal side of marriage).

Please tell me if there is something that I've totally forgotten about that needs to be mentioned. This is actually a very small part of my paper (in regards to the LGBT rights movement that is) and the bulk of it is on the separation of church and state being a sound argument for the removal of the word marriage from legislation which would allow this to happen.

Today marks exactly two months since I came out

One of my biggest concerns right after I came out was getting in contact with my sister. I was finally able to and we met. I had high hopes that she would be accepting and still want to stay in touch. Unfortunately, really hurt. I'm not giving up though. She will be moving to OSU in August and out of the immediate influence of my mom, so I'm really hoping that she will begin to open her heart and mind. So that put me completely disowned from my family.

After I came out I went down to my friends house and OKC and lived with them for a few weeks while looking for a job and a place to live in Stillwater. They were the most incredible people you will ever meet. They fed me, stay focused on getting everything straightened out for school and work, even put me on their cell phone plan. I couldn't have asked for better people in my life at that moment.

I filled out countless job applications, got an interview, and wouldn't you know it; I didn't get the job...Instead they hired me as the lead for marketing and customer service on a new project they had started! It had much better hours and paid better than anything I could have hoped for working at the bakery as originally planned; I couldn't believe it. 

At this point we are around half-way through June. I was contacted by a redditor from Stillwater who offered me an extra room to stay for the summer after reading my story. I can't thank you enough

About the same time I moved back to Stillwater, and we've been in touch ever since. It was an amazing feeling to know I wasn't alone, and she has been a great source of support for me. Well, somehow (I'm assuming someone was spying on my FB for her), my mom found out that the cousin was talking to me. She called her and started yelling and cursing at her, telling fer she didn't know what the ___ she was getting into, and how dare she talk to her son; asked if she was a Lesbian and threatened to out her to the rest of the family, a week apart. One from my mom; one from my dad. My mom's email was just plain weird

Ten days ago, and the bars. It's kind of weird living alone without any roommates, but at the same time, it makes me feel like I'm finally standing on my own two feet. I'm slowly, but surely building up my supplies to actually make it a home; but it's absolutely fantastic! 

And last but not least, frisbee games, Electric Beatdown Thursdays - always a new adventure. They have celebrated the little victories with me, and held me in their arms when I was crying my eyes out. I've never had friends like this, and to have a group that loves and accepts me for being 100% me, and that is fantastic. As a matter of fact, I even got me a boyfriend out of the group! :D 

I'd like to put something here for anyone who may think that they are in a situation with their family like I was. I know how scary it is being in that situation. If I could give you any advice it would be two-fold. First, but work your ass off so that you can support yourself and not have to face what I did. If this is simply not possible, and you are put in a scenario like I was, where you have to come out now - you can make it! It's hard, insanely hard, and scary as hell, but you can make it! Keep your head up, I had nights where I was so scared I was shaking, but [It Get's Better!](http://www.itgetsbetter.org/). If you ever need to talk to someone

TL;DR I came out to my family, jobless, and alone. Two months later, I'm completely independent, fantastic job, house, friends

""Mom


   There is a reason I got so aggravated about what Bill O'Reilly was saying earlier tonight on his program. It's the same reason I left your marriage ceremony a bit upset Friday after you made that tasteless joke in front of your friends


   I've wanted to talk to you


   I'm gay. I've known that for a long time, for fear of my friends and coworkers finding out, and for fear of whoever else might find out. Every day I have to lie to people. I have to suppress a very big part of my life out of fear of it effecting my life in a more negative way than it already has and it's eating me from the inside out. I can't take my significant-other to company Christmas parties, we can't hold hands in public, we can't get married, if I were dying on a hospital bed, he would not be allowed to see me, and to top it off,"" or ""trying to destroy tradition.""


   When you said those things a couple weeks ago, while you're planning your own wedding to a man you haven't even known a year.


   Don't get me wrong. I think Gary's a great guy,"" because it's really NOT some liberal, immoral, family-hating agenda like you think it is. It's people like me, who want a fair shot at happiness, the way you and Gary have a shot at happiness.


   I'm trying my best here to really let you know how I feel, had your car's window smashed in, beat up, teased, and had rumors start up about you from people you don't even know, all for something you already hate about yourself, I don't think you'll get it.""

I'm straight but if I have a son or daughter that's gay I'll be damned if they don't have the same rights that I do....

My family however

They live on the east coast.  I live in SF.

I've never let them say anything discriminatory in front of me without it being challenged and flat out calling them hateful bigots.

Anyway.  Last week I flew back to spend some time with them... They're my family after all and before this our relationship was good... I see them like 1x a year.

We're having dinner and somehow the conversation turns to Obama and ""Don't Ask

Long story short

I stand up and say that it's not right to discriminate against ANYONE regardless of sexuality

... then it dawns on me... they don't know that I'm NOT gay.

So I just come out of the closet.

I live in SF... I'm 35... I'm fit

(though for the record I have plenty of girlfriends

They think I'm bluffing but once I stick to my guns (and they can see that I'm visually upset) it dawns on them that I'm homosexual.

My dad goes silent and just leaves the table. My sister calls me a jerk for coming out ...my brother in law is pissed.  My mother is crying.

At this point I decide I'm not going back.  I'm going to be gay as far as they're concerned for the rest of my life.

It was pretty heated... I left shortly after.  My calls to the house aren't answered.  My sister says she's ok with it but that I shouldn't have come out of the closet....

In a way it hurts because I had a good relationship with my mother and father before this - however

So here I am.... one of you .  I'm ostracized from my family.  I'm out of the closet and kicked in the teeth.  

This is harder than I thought.

Didn't think that much about it - kids that age tend not to always fall into gender role toys - though I thought his parents deserved some credit for not forcing a football in his hands. I just said ""Awesome! Good for you!"" and forgot about it.

This weekend is Purim, a few cats, a bunch of super heroes, one or two army men. And there, in the front row, was my buddy wearing a purple dress and a tiara. 

And he said ""Does my dress look pretty?""

And I said ""Yes

And all I could think was, how amazing for that kid to live in an age when not one of those kids he was with made fun of him for wearing a dress or playing with dolls. It was just who he is.

Anyway, I choked on almost every word but they came out a few at a time. Just remembering as I'm typing makes me shake a little. 

This girl has been my best friend since we were in 7th grade (we both just turned 27) and have been together for almost 5 years now. She was soooooo supportive and happy that I was able to come out to her. I emptied my entire soul on her. I told her that I'm transgendered and that I cant keep living in secret. How much pain and suffering it has caused me over the years. The depression, I would spend my time alone wearing her clothes (Which she totally noticed) and just being myself. How in high school I would secretly dress up in full makeup and a wig and walk around the local mall getting cute looks from boys and sometimes girls. It was all I really had to be myself and relax. About all the collections of clothes and shoes and wigs I've gotten rid of in vain attempts to escape or hide who I am. All my stress, anger, anxiety, our relationship problems, everything, it all stems from me having to hide who I really am in fear of losing everything and everyone I love. 

She held me while I cried and told me everything was fine. She told me she loves me for who I am

That was almost 2 weeks ago. Since then our relationship has been so much more amazing than I could have ever imagined. We went on a trip for a weekend and spent the entire time talking about everything and enjoying each others company. We laughed about her insecurities as I told her what was really going on while she was at school. I told her how I would spend time here on reddit or other forum sites talking to people who encouraged me to stay strong. When we got back she told me I had free reign of her clothes until I got my own

I cant remember the last time I was genuinely happy. I feel like I can breathe again. My nightmares are gone. I smile more. I laugh. I wear color again. Everything has become so much easier. Even getting up in the morning to go to work. I get excited to come home and be myself with the girl I love. I look forward to my future instead of living in fear that I will never be myself. Trapped in a body that is not the real me. It will be a hard road ahead but as long as I have my beautiful

I needed to tell someone what an amazing and crazy-town banana-pants journey I've had the past couple weeks, thanks for listening my fabulous redditors, it's supportive communities like this that have helped keep me alive and sane knowing that I'm not alone. /hug

TL;DR - Came out to my wonderful fiancee

So basically

I'm an 18, the whole denial thing joined with the whole 'I'm not really ready to accept it yet' thing. I've known forever that I'm not into guys. This was something that gradually grew very obvious as I got older because, whilst all of my friends were out dating and entering that desperate zone where they were searching for a man as if their life depended on it, I was sitting at home staring at pictures of women and lying to myself that I wished I looked like them, rather than really acknowledging the fact that I wanted to date them. 

My parents had obviously figured this out before I had. My father and I were watching television yesterday afternoon before the topic of marriage came up, rather shocked at the fact that he'd even so much as mentioned it. And because I didn't outright deny it, he shrugged and told me that he didn't mind. With a huge, smug grin on his face. Then my mum laughed and told me that it didn't matter whether I was gay or straight or anything inbetween. 

So I pretty much came out, especially since I've been carrying it for years. So I'm now out of the closet, with parents who didn't make a huge deal out of it and going on as if everything is very much the same.
