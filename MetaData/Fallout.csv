This is where my life was changed.
 I come home from school, My mom asked me if I wanted his xbox and of course I did. So after hooking all of it up to my 10 inch tv I got on his account and loaded up fallout 3. This was my first time playing the game and I had no clue what to do. So I wander around and I eventually get to Rivet City, and was amazed at this place. A huge aircraft carrier that became a post apocalyptic town.  I explored it for a good half hour and eventually got to the top of the tower. I'm pretty sure you guys know who's usually up there. So I talk to Mr Lopez standing near the ledge, and of course I help him, But then I thought to myself,  I helped this old man who had nothing to live for found light in his life.. Why couldn't I help my brother? Then I felt like crap feeling regret that I could've helped him.(At the time I didn't really realize that It was completely out of my control and I couldn't help no matter what) So for the next year, I completely shut everything out except for fallout and helped everyone I could because I felt like it was my responsibility to help everyone to make up for the one person that I couldn't. So I ended up finishing the game on his profile and putting it to rest and I never played on it again, I just couldn't play that profile again. I guess it was just my way of letting go and moving on. 
This is also the first time for me telling this story to anyone. I just felt like it needed to be told.

Let players raise to the head or second in command of factions like in the Elder Scrolls

More options for non-combat, you need to get X item from Y 'dungeon', hire a guy to do it.  Maybe he dies and your money is gone, maybe he succeeds.  Maybe he gets item and decides to extort you, so you have to hire someone else to kill him.  Can actually have mercs that you do business with a bunch become more loyal and reliable to you.  A whole faction type set up could be made by having several competing merc companies, not just a 'good' and 'evil' one like in FO3.

Other than those, more everything.

Thoughts?
