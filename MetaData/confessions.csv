I come from a poor family, and we'd be forced to go to my aunt's house to be babysat; not always by my aunt. It began when I was 5, and we were visiting my aunt but she had left for work and were left in the hands of my alcoholic uncle.
 It started with verbal abuse, I understood why he was always yelling. It started escalating from yelling across the room to in our faces. By the time I turned 6, He was in our faces every time we were left in his care. It took a turn for the physical when he started throwing things at us. After months of screaming, throwing shoes, clothes, toys and different household objects at us, he finally started to take a turn for hitting us with his hand. I knew he would go after my sister, I would lock my sister in a closet and tell her to stay until I came and got her. For about 10 months I was subjected to beatings, and assaulted verbally and physically. Throughout the times I was being assaulted I would lock my sister away, I had learned how to patch up any wounds I received while being beaten. Spending time reading books and watching instructional videos on first aid and self defense. Teaching myself how to block some of the more powerful hits to stave off more serious injury. 

It continued on up until the following spring. 

That spring, which my parents agreed to. My mom said I would stay at my aunt's until morning when she could come and get me, because there was no more room in the car. After crying and protesting the idea, she still left, and my sister and I left in the hands of my aunt (who was dead asleep in her room) and my overly intoxicated uncle. 
When the party ended and I was in the family room awake, stumbling just to stand. He followed me and grabbed me by my arms, throwing me on the floor. after about a minute of him pinning me down, slapping me calling me a waste of space, Putting out is cigarette on my already scarred legs, he got up pushed me aside and started stumbling towards the family room where my sister was sleeping. 
I knew he wanted to go after her. I spent nearly a year hiding her away and protecting her from him, chasing me down and punching me with a closed fist. Something he didn't do before. 
I managed to get away from him and ran downstairs.. Enraged he tried following me

I stayed up the rest of the night, My mother came to pick us up, we left and I never said a word. The following night, he was arrested for drunk driving after crashing his truck into a pole. My sister told my mom of the screaming, and she told us she'd wouldn't leave us there anymore. He was in prison for 3 years, and when he came back out, I was already 11, my sister and my 2 brothers. I never saw him again

Now, and I learned to live with it until I confided in my bestfriend of 7 years who is now currently my girlfriend,Who told me that my paranoia, my fear of people and fear of pain isn't normal. 

I am now looking for help, was to write all of this out, and put it out there for the world to see. I didn't do this for Karma, points or whatever, this post was for me. And now, as hard as this was to write out, I'm going to find a therapist, when i'm comfortable enough in thinking I have dealt with these issues and problems


I can do this.

Why did I sign up for this? It's the greatest lie ever told. I work 1.5 jobs to keep my family just barely afloat, my wife is stressed out by having to deal with the needy kids all day, and I dread going home after work because all I get to do is take care of the kids until they go to sleep. And with one of them being a pain in the ass 5 month old, I'm lucky if I can get to bed by midnight. 

Between 8am and midnight there is always a child awake. They rarely nap

I got married because I love my wife and wanted to spend my life with her. That's not what I got. I now get 1% of her attention while the kids take 99% of it. When my wife does talk to me

People see me my family and tell me how lucky we are. And how much they miss those days of having little kids. Are you fucking kidding me? Does it actually get worse from here?

I have a deep passion for movies. Haven't been to a movie theater in 2.5 years. I have a netflix account. I watch less than 2 movies per month

I've known you for around 5 years. My girlfriend at the time H was a mutual friend of yours and your friends.  This is how our friendship began.  We had very similar interests, and a bunch of other stuff. H and I dated for around a year of that time.  We became very close friends.  After I broke up with her, I texted you and told you I was sorry for what had happened and what was about to happen.   You responded with, ""Gotta do what you gotta do.""  I didn't hear from you for quite a while, almost a year after that.  You added me back as a friend on facebook.  We began hanging out again, like nothing had happened.  Drinking playing video games all night.  Talking about philosophy, and what there could or could not be in this world.  

One night when we were drinking at your parents house, however, not opposed to it.  We fucked in the hot tube and then your parents bath tub and then in your bed.  

I thought the next morning was going to be weird, telling me that you had fun and that we should try it sometime with less alcohol.  I agreed.  We have fucked many times since then.  However, our hanging out is so sporadic.  Due to many reasons I'm sure.  This whole venture that we have been on has been exciting and strange, but I fervently enjoy it. The last time that we did anything together was not that long ago, but for the first time we did something different.  You gave me this look dead in my eyes, and the next thing I know your tongue is down my throat.  We've never kissed before, it's about the only thing we haven't done.  It was amazing, it made my distort and my head race.  I haven't seen you or talked to you since then

I understand that for gays and non-gay supporters of gay marriage this issue is seen in a similar light as the civil rights movement for African Americans in the 1960s.

I don't care for bigots

Rationally

On an emotional level

The government seems incapable of doing basic budgetary duties to keep the country running and it may hurt the already sucky economy further.   There is a huge amount of unemployment and threats to existing jobs.   Americans are earning less and less.   Global climate change is serious and nothing as serious as that problem deserves is being done about it.   Right wingers are rolling back reproductive freedom at a fast clip without any serious opposition.

Yet

Yipee.

I am *worried* about some big things and nobody is talking about them as much as they are talking about gay marriage.

Everyday I am worried about the economy and my job.  No group is standing up for me.   The activists I see coming out of the gay marriage office near my tea shop live in an elite area where most people earn 6 figure salaries.

I have a lot of women friends on and off facebook.  They all go on about gay marriage endlessly.

I know it is a worth issue

Ugly spleen venting done.

My mum was distraught, but no one ever knew as she begged me not to tell and my sisters were kept well by myself. 

Once my mum got over depression the anger started, but I of coursed still loved him and wanted to see him). Then my mum started to regret her life choices and wanted to be a teenager again, she stopped taking care of Sophia to such an extent that my sister would call me mum. All the time my mum would use me as a sounding board for her problems, she would be lonely and I would try and make her feel better by sleeping in the bed with her and doing all the housework and secretly sneaking her my savings from my money box so she wouldn't worry so much about money.
This went on for about a year.

Then the boyfriends started...

She had two

Joe was her old boss, she confessed this to me every time it happened.

She got pregnant, so it was spoilt by Joe and my mum. They forgot Sophia existed, and Sophia appeared to accept it, she had never really had my mum as a mother and had me instead. I saw it was wrong so I spoke up to Joe, to my mum, to everyone. 

My mum didn't like that

So, however it was never his fault he was a drunk, it was apparently mine, I apparently ruined their marriage by questioning their actions as parents. So, being cut off from anyone, she started to take her slowly dying life out on me, hitting me

I would fantasize about leaving, anything to get me away.  I felt like i could do nothing to help her and anything I would do would get me punished. I went into depression and became anorexic, maintaining 6st for over 3 years of my teenage years.

But I was saved... and got a boyfriend. My mum and Joe are extreme catholics so when Joe and my mum found out about my bf Joe threw me out of the house as he wasn't catholic or pre-approved. I went to live with my boyfriend and through him I re-met my dad and my extended family. I beat anorexia and never felt like committing suicide again.

I was saved, who I looked after when she was sick, who I taught to count, to read, to dress herself, to walk, to talk and to use the potty. I left her... and I feel so bad about it.

But I haven't ever told anyone how bad it was

I got my friends and my family to turn to when I feel like being sociable mainly on weekends.

I want to dedicate myself to being the picture of health. I just want to be that guy that everyone likes. That guy that doesn't have the weight of a mortgage, a crying baby, utility bills, city taxes, school taxes, car payments, oil changes

I want to be that guy that just has to worry about making his rent on time

I wish I could go back and do it all over again. I go to bed every night and wish that I would wake up and find myself back in my first year of college and have a real chance to not make the same mistakes.

If I divorce

I do not want any harm to come to them

My mom and I had been arguing and she is notorious for saying very hurtful things. I didn't know at the time that she had something very wrong in her mind. It all started over a fucking cheeseburger. My sister went to grab some dinner and I asked her to get me something while she was there. I asked her, you can't even do that right."" She had just beat the shit out of me a month before and I could feel it coming. She (was) a large lady and I was 100 lbs. She choked me til I nearly went unconscious. I managed to pull her by the hair to get her off. I never wanted to hit my mom.

 I yelled back to her ""fine, police came. I was sitting in my cedar tree outside where I relax. A cop found me, and seemed to care. I asked him to get me help. I asked him to shoot me if he didn't. I didn't want to live. I was obviously sent to the stress unit at the hospital. I was covered in bruises and cuts from both her and myself. I told the doctors and staff what happened. I felt relief after nearly 2 weeks there. Of course, I had to go back home. 

Literally the day after I get out of the hospital the police came back. I was next door (where my sister lives.) They asked for me and I came outside thinking ""wtf now."" I will never forget that son of a bitch cop who wouldn't tell me why he was there. Another cop car came and they told me to put my hands behind my back. I instantly started crying and freaking out. 

""Why??!?? What did I do?"" I wasn't even told my charges until they were driving me to jail. The cop said some smart ass remark about people who hurt their own mothers. He told me I was being arrested on a felony warrant of criminal recklessness. I tried to tell the cop that I had no idea what he meant. He finally muttered that my mother told them I stabbed her. WHAT THE HELL?

I was assaulted by a female cop when I went in. She did my strip down and cough and squat. She was training another female cop and when she got to my breasts

They threw me in the cell for sick people because I was still considered  very ill.I was cut off of my meds, I asked her why she did it. Why she lied. She acted like she wasn't lying and making it all up on the spot. I finally got to go to court. I never had the chance to speak other than entering my plea. I was appointed a piece of shit public defender. They let me out under the conditions that I don't live with my mother anymore, and that I continue seeking mental health care. 

I lived with a family friend after that. I got a thick envelope full of ""evidence"" against me. The knife I had used to cut with was laying on the floor where I left it. My mother had a small scratch (probably from me trying to get her off of me.) She called that her ""stab wound."" It was located on her forearm. She had me.  She never went to the hospital or even a doctor for that matter. The cop that believed her must have really been a fool. 

Fast forward a year later. My mother was diagnosed with a long list of mental illnesses and has accused 3 other people of hurting her since. She had to be moved to a nursing home because her brain no longer functions like it should. She is with it sometimes

I just went to court in August. I moved 200+ miles away and had to have my sister help me get my proof that my mom just lost it. We had papers from her doctors and my own doctors that state the obvious. My mother and I both have problems

I am so angry. I lost everything I owned due to my arrest

I had my life torn apart by this. Just the *thought* of me stabbing my own mom makes me sad. I lost everything, my bed and every single picture I had. I hate the police now, the system. Anyone can say you did something and the cops will believe them. I am already torn down by depression and anxiety, the PTSD has sat in and I am fucking tired of this mess.

I was in a time of real loneliness and neediness. I've never had very good self esteem, or going on a road trip with a girlfriend etc. I was imagining the same girl in all the fantasies. Eventually I started fantasizing about sex with her, and kissing her, and cuddling with her. I loved it. Before too long, this was all I thought about. Every night when trying to fall asleep, I would imagine her cuddling with me. If I had to go somewhere, I imagined going there with her. I was never alone, this fictional

Now, but I just thought that once I found a real girl I really liked, I wouldn't need the fantasies anymore. Well, one night I was watching a horror movie, and there was a scene where a guy's wife gets murdered in front of him. For some reason, I imagined myself and the fantasy girl in that situation. If I saw her get murdered in front of me. I almost cried. What I realized shortly after was something that would affect the rest of my life. I had actual feelings for an imaginary woman. 


Well

Over the next year or so, and even had experiences with real girls like the ones I wanted. However, the bad thing was that I had set the fantasy girl as my standard. The main problem with all my girlfriends was that they were't the fantasy girl. I was disappointed by losing my virginity because it wasn't lost to the fantasy girl. I knew this was bad, and I tried to get rid of her by ignoring the thoughts completely. Distracting myself from thinking about her long enough for her to fade back into being just another product of my imagination. But I found that I got upset and lonely when I did this. I needed her to not feel depressed and lonely all the time, and I needed her gone to be able to have a normal relationship with a girl. It was a lose-lose situation.

I just noticed how much I've typed

After a lot of mental discipline, and she flirts back and everything works out. Or if I'm feeling depressed and worthless, I might lay down for a while, and imagine the fantasy girl cuddling with me and trying to make me feel better.

(NSFW),badfriend64,57,18,38,"My best friend let's call her Nikki and I have been best friends for six years.  She is the best friend I have ever had I and I don't know if I'm actually sorry that I did the following events but I need to tell someone so reddit I'm telling you.

Ok the story starts a few days ago when she and I were getting ready for a trip to the beach that we are taking this weekend.  We went shopping for some supplies for the trip when she gets the idea that we should go hang out with another good friend of ours that coming with us I'll can him Dan.  Well we end up at Dan's house just hanging out and enjoying the nice weather this was around 8:30.  Now Dan and I hadn't seen each other in two years due to extenuating circumstances so we spent a lot of time catching up with each other.  Nikki didn't like that she wasn't included in a large part of the conversation so she started to hang all over Dan.

At this point I should note that Dan as been in love with Nikki for six years and she knows this and has never done anything about it even after he actually admitted his love for her she did nothing.  I still don't know how but somehow they remained friends.  Anyway back to the story well a few hours later around midnight we decide that sitting on the wooden benches we had been sitting on was getting very uncomfortable so we all decided to lay down on the large wooden deck table together. The three of us cuddled for hours Dan in the middle and Nikki and I on each side.  Now there was a lot of sexual tension building up as we were doing this but nothing was said or done it was just something you could feel.

Around 2:30 I realize that Dan might have fallen asleep and its late so Nikki and I should get home.  So I wake up Nikki and She wakes up Dan who pulls us both in for a big bear hug which ends with Nikki laying across his lap and me sitting on the table next to him with his arm round around my waist.  Nikki had fallen asleep again while laying on Dan's lap so Dan started moving is hand closer and closer to my inner thighs and he started rubbing my clit through my shorts.  I probably should have stopped him but it felt good so I didn't. He end up fingering me for twenty minutes before I make him stop because its almost 3am.  When he finally stops rubbing my clit we make-out for maybe five more minutes but then I decide its time to go home so I wake up Nikki and she and I leave.

On the car ride home I was so confused by what had just happened between Dan and I that I was visibly shaking and looked very very pale so Nikki ask me what was wrong.  I told her the Dan had fingered me and I wasn't sure what was going on.  At this point all she had to say was if anything happens between the two of you we can't hang out anymore.

The next day I decided to talk to Dan about what had happened the night before.  So I told Nikki what I was doing and she questioned if I was really going to talk with him or if something else was going on.  At this point I all I wanted to do is talk to Dan to tell him that what had happened can never happen again.  That night I go over to Dan's house and we do talk about Nikki's reaction and he is loving how jealous she and how she only seems mad at me and not him. He thought the whole thing was funny.  I feel I should point out that he only felt this way because of his feelings for Nikki.  He wasn't being a jackass to me and I agreed that it was funny that she was jealous of me.

Through the course of the night I end up taking a ride with Dan in his tuck and he has one big bench seat so we are sitting very close together and he put his hand on my leg.  At that point I knew what was going to happen. When we get back to his house neither one of us gets out of the truck we just kinda sit there and then all of a sudden something clicked.

We start making out and he starts grabbing my boobs and it feels good so I take off my shirt and my bra and he starts sucking on my tits.  A few minutes later he pulls out his dick and I give him a blow job. As I'm sucking his dick he keeps telling me how its the best blow job he has ever received which make me just want to keep sucking on him.  Maybe ten minutes later he is fingering me again and it feels fantastic and we both say how much we wanna fuck each other so he grabs a condom and we climb into the back on his truck

As soon as we're both back there we take off what clothes we still had on and go at it.  I was on top first and came after maybe fifteen minutes which was a shock to me because I rarely come that quickly.  When Dan realized that we switch positions so he was on top and he went at me like no man before him.  That was the first night I ever came twice and it was awesome.  After about a hour of fucking in his truck he finishes and we get dressed.  We both agreed not to tell anyone what happened and I left. 

Later Nikki sent me a text asking how the talk went and I told her that everything was gonna to go back to normal to which she responded if we were hiding anything from her our friendship would effectively be over.  The next time I'll see both of them is when we go to the beach but I know they have seen each other since Dan and I fucked.  I really dislike hiding this from her but I don't feel guilty about what happened between Dan and I.

Well there's my story thanks for reading if you read the whole thing.

1376036730.0,1k0kaa,Bad news takes me on from a prostitute to a random gang bang.,PervyMcPervPerv,55,19,13,"Where to start. 

4 Years ago my wife cheated on me. We had been dealing with an autistic child and escalating bills and the recent tragic death of a friend

She tried to keep it quiet but I figured it out.  It nearly tore us to pieces and unfortunately took our son along for the ride.  I hit a level of depression I didn’t realize existed. I struck back at friends and family for years of perceived slights.  She tried to explain that she thought I didn’t love her because I had been verbally abusive to her.  

I drank, until I finally had that moment of clarity.  

I embraced therapy, I did the exercises, I meditated, and on the other side of this long harrowing fight, I’ve never been happier.  I feel more comfortable with myself than I ever have, and while not exactly the most confident person ever, I’m worlds from where I was prior to the cheating.

Long before the cheating we had talked about moving to another state.  This had become derailed while we figured each other out.  Once we were on stable grounds we decided to try by playing resume roulette to the locations we had agreed upon: New Jersey, and Massachusetts.

She had a job in Seattle within three weeks.

I was leery but undaunted.  I was sure he was still out here but a small part of me realized: So what. Say he is, and you’ll deal, move on and be happier anyway.

We moved out, this is the job, there will never be another. They could cut my pay and I would stay. (That statement alone is half the reason I did a burn account.) But the marriage wasn’t working. Trust was shattered and not coming back. We agreed to split but we had recently rented a house so I would live in the same house so our son’s life wouldn’t go into to much of an upheaval and also to save money.  We made conditions: No bringing boyfriends or girlfriends to the house without the other person meeting them first and only if it was serious.  I made one simple condition: Please don’t contact the old boyfriend until we’ve completely settled this. She had agreed and made no condition like that with me.

While it’s summer time her mother came out to help us with our son while we worked, then talk to our child about it and I would move into the basement.  In the meantime we still share a bed.

I contacted an old friend that she had not liked and who I had given up to try and repair our marriage.  I went out and tried to see other people, but money was tight so I tapped it down.

On Sunday a stray thought entered my head and wouldn’t leave.  I asked her if she was talking with him and she was evasive.

I was floored.  We argued

I pointed out:
1) Because she promised 

2) Because I never had sex with my friend while married to her. 

She still didn’t understand the big deal until I pointed out two last things:

1) She asked me to promise I would be her friend, and she had a meltdown for two days after his birthday until he contacted her. )

2) I can never tell my family about her talking with this guy. Because even I have a hard time believing this WHOLE thing wasn’t just a big ol’ trick to get to Seattle.

I walked out after that. Walked around for over an hour and calmly decided what I was going to do.

I was going to find a prostitute

I went home

Next night I went to the woman’s apartment. I wasn’t nervous

Fucking Internet Photo Voodoo.

It was her from the pictures, you got issues and you are trying to manipulate your customers.  She worked her mouth well which helped but I just couldn’t get myself excited for it.  I tried for 30 straight minutes then finally just faked an orgasm into the condom. (Lube covered up I hadn’t done a damn thing) Then I hightailed it out of there.

I felt down, a whisky, a bowl of nachos and a copy of Assassins Creed 3. I had brought my GamerTag on a thumb drive and managed to rack up some Gamerscore to boot.  The guys were nice, the bar was awesome, I would be back soon.

Now I’m heading home and a stray thought hits me.  For being a technology sector

A 24-7 porn store? Really? What for? Wait

The stray thought hit

I go there

“Where does that go?”

“To the theaters in the basement.”

“How does that work?”

“Its twelve bucks for 6 hours

“I’ll take one ticket please.”

Through the doorway

I walked in to a medium room with a giant flat screen showing some blonde getting a proper pounding.  Some chairs, going straight back into another room, and another door directly left of that going into a room to the left.  

I tried the straight back room

In the room to the left

It was then that I noticed the entire room watching them and not the porn.

I casually walked by and into the last room, sitting there jerking each other off, on the screen was a BDSM flick.  

First observation is how amazing it is that everyone notices each other but there’s never eye contact

I think of myself as somewhat worldly

The couple continue to make it, but any many could cum on her body if they wanted.

And then three men lined up.

And sure enough, I felt the desire for a cigarette and asked the cashier about it.  She pointed out a place a block down the road. I walked out and saw a man who was just in the theater a moment ago, start walking back in, this time with a staggeringly beautiful woman.

“Karma obviously doesn’t want me smoking.” So like a puppy following the food bowl

By this time everyone who had been left were spread out in different rooms.  Three in blonde room, myself, and another man who followed me from upstairs when he saw what had walked in.  The woman and man sat in a corner, and it didn’t take long for all the rooms to empty and converge on BDSM.

The girl had a tight body and was vocal

She worked him like a pro then he stood up and she sat down.  She worked him more while hi fingered her and she moaned.  Finally he said the words the gathered men were waiting for:

“She needs a dick for each hand

Sure enough, and she started to suck on the dicks of each of the men.

One tried to reach for her pussy and was yelled at and replaced.  

“You’re lucky she’s sucking your dicks!” and the man left the theater.  The boyfriend asked for another and one stood in front.  Hand job to the left

Now I was aroused. She was beautiful, but she was completely in charge and she was loving this.

She bent over two chairs, cock out, waiting while she rested. The man on her left walked to a corner and finished off with three strokes of his cock.  

The boyfriend kept her hot while waiting for her drink, an empty spot to her left, the words came out before I realized I had said them.

“May I take the left?”

The boyfriend said yes.

I walked over

Ladies a piece of advice, but your actions will be simply that, technique. For the first time in my life I had woman suck on my cock not out of obligation or because it was what I wanted, it was because SHE wanted it, and every tug and lick proved it.

I asked for permission to touch her tits

She switched positions, so I stroked It twice and rewarded the wall with my semen, crying out louder than I ever have.  

When the night ended I thanked her, walking out at the same time as the man who had followed ME down with them.

We didn’t say a word

He said: “I’m gonna have to come here more often.”

“Me too” I replied.

I’m not sure if I actually will

No

The confession part of all this? I don’t feel shame, because there’s always something out there unexpected.

Since I was the only non-developer who was working on the product, customer service, PR, SEO — all that jazz — and I did it well. 

A few months later

We then went through 3 rounds of financing

In one month

But it's all theoretical. I don't become fully exercised until December. We haven't had an IPO. As good as this business is (we are making a lot of money!) things change. When the next round of financing closes

The rest of my shares are pretty much locked up until either our company gets bought *or* we have an IPO.

Making things more interesting to me is one more singular fact: as this company gets bigger (we have well over 700 employees now!), customer service, PR, or SEO. All I do with my time now is look over reports and develop product road maps.

We had a lot of common interests, we had conversations, we had a LOT of fun together and sex was amazing. I should mention that I had lived at my parents house up until shortly after we started dating.

From outside

They are a family of 8 - parents, but all she gets are mean words, occasional slaps and a constant reminder that her mother was a whore( she was found abandoned at a hospital).

But there's more.

Last week, I was single. We fucked. And after that she told me that 4 out of 5 brothers have molested her. She has to share a room with one of the brothers, and he constantly tries to force himself on her. If she doesn't wish to have sex with him, then she has to give a BJ just for him to leave her alone. She told me, even though she is not biologically related with them, she is disgusted with the idea of having sex with them. The brothers constantly grope her when she is working, she has learned to ignore it.

So I asked her

Her father molests her too. It seems when she was 11

More recently

In the past

Today I got a chance to talk with her again. It seems her dad is badgering her for a BJ and was willing to pay for it. And her mother is now looking for alliances for her. And she overheard her mother talking to her relative saying - I don't care what he does or looks like

1354754355.0,14cs7m,I'm a woman and I HATE other women,throwaway70000,60,26,41,"It wasn't always like this

I think my relationship with my mother is a big reason why I hate other women.  Not the only reason though.  Women have always been mean to me.  Some early memories include my paternal grandma buying gifts for my older brothers and nothing for me- I was 2 years old.  She also went on to treat me like shit every time I visited her.  Next

Fast forward to high school where I went to an all-girl high school where I was HATED for no REASON. I should let you know that I was a shy, throw snow at me, called me names.  I never did anything to these girls.  I never understood all the hate.  I was treated very badly.  College was not as bad but there were still instances where I would be harassed by other girls.  Given dirty looks, called names from them driving by in their cars, purposely excluded, etc.

Then the job world came and I entered a workforce made up predominately of females.  Again, tried to get me fired. harassment. This went on for a long time.  I made friends at work one time only to have one of them date a man I was seeing behind my back.  They invited me along to bars and gatherings because I attract men.  They were using me.  I cut them out of my life recently.

Today, get my nails done, I am met with nasty glances, looked up and down, being stared at and occasionally the catty comment (FROM and ABSOLUTE STRANGER).

I have no idea why I am constantly a target for bitches.  I thought as I get older it would get easier.  It hasn't.  Why do these cunts make everything I do so difficult?  I am sick and tired of IGNORING them.  That doesn't work.  

I HAVE A GODDAMN RIGHT to exist too.  I have done nothing to you cunts.  I mind my own business and don't bother anyone.  I'm still a quiet person

I don't want your fat

LIFE IS NOT A COMPETITION!!!  NO ONE IS KEEPING SCORE!  ANYONE with half a brain knows the illusion you put on to the outside world is just a cover up for your unhappy marriage

I prefer not to have any female friends because all of you suck so badly.  It's so obvious that you hate yourself.  

If I never make a female ""friend"" again then that is all right with me.

1368550401.0,1ebnu9,I think I am a psychopath,remorselessthrowaway,54,22,56,"TL;DR: I am a successful, but because I have no particular desire to

Whether you use the term psychopath, so many of the traits feel self-descriptive I don't see how it could be wrong.

Traits normally associated with these terms are: lack of empathy and remorse, and impulsivity. ASPD is characterized by at least three of the following: 

* Callous unconcern for the feelings of others;
* Gross and persistent attitude of irresponsibility and disregard for social norms
* Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships
* Very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression
* Incapacity to experience guilt or to profit from experience
* Marked readiness to blame others or to offer plausible rationalizations for the behavior that has brought the person into conflict with society.

I haven't committed any of the crimes one might normally associate with these disorders (murder, etc).  But the overriding reason is that risk of capture combined with severity of punishments make it not worth it to me.  I'm not a sadist - I don't crave violence.  I just don't care.  If I thought I could kill my wife's ex-husband with no repurcussions, I would probably do it.

I pretend to have Asperger's.  I might actually have it, and Asperger's is a more acceptable excuse for why I get things wrong than sociopathy.

I fake emotional reactions all the time.  My wife is sexy and a good wife.  My life would be more difficult without her.  So I pretend to feel bad when she is in pain

My wife is not my first wife.  My first wife gained a lot of weight, although she had a better excuse -- her husband was an abusive jackass).  So she said I needed to decide.  I chose her easily.  She was way hotter and liked sex a lot more.

I lie all the time.  Whenever I think I can get away with it.  I'm not a pathological liar - I lie when it will benefit me to do so.  But if I judge that the consequences of truth will be minor enough

When I was a kid, and are linked to homicidal behavoir.  I don't do them anymore, because I don't get pleasure out of them.

I don't think I'm alone.  I think the sociopaths that get studied, or flawed. Intellegent sociopathy, without sadism, is a survival trait.  One that, I think, explains politicians and CEOs (in general).

Just so you know I’m a 21 year old guy…

My whole life I've struggled with anxiety and as I've gotten older it has slowly developed into depression. My parents never took the depression seriously; they assumed that I was a normal teenager. I tried to kill myself twice

Whilst in hospital I saw a therapist who constantly asked me what I thought the cause of my anxiety was
My parents also asked me the same question; they argued that no one in our family was 'like me' and that there had to be an environmental cause to my anxiety and depression. They also told me about how they noticed that one day I was a normal child and the next day I became what I am.
I ignored this question whenever I was asked it because I never wanted to admit to anyone the real reason why I’m like this.

I remember when I was in primary school; I don’t remember when exactly
I had been taken out of class by a lady from the reception who told me my mum was there to take me to the dentist

He took me to the boiler room first which was in a separate building; he told me he had to quickly do something that he needed my help with. But once the door shut behind us he grabbed my wrists
I started crying when he pulled my trousers off so he grabbed my hair and said that if I wasn’t quiet he would kill me.

He raped me. I remember it hurt. I didn’t like it.

Afterwards he told me he wouldn’t do it again if I didn’t tell anyone

I remember walking back
I hoped I wouldn’t run into anyone because I didn’t think I could look them in the eye. It was hard holding back the tears; I had to exhale hard to make sure I didn’t cry. 

Sometimes I think this is what broke me
I never told anyone I was raped, to see if that will help me sort out my issues.",,False,,t5_2qq6g,1345759495.0,,

1300920308.0,ga23p,I feel like a terrible mother,cinnamoninitinamin,35,5,13,"I have twins and they're still infants. Currently my husband and I are living in a 2 bedroom house with his mother, there's not enough room

Don't get me wrong, just long enough to regain my sanity. I don't think I'd ever do it, because I love my husband and I love my kids too much. I'm burned out.

When I found out I was pregnant

My husband was in school full time at the time, money was (and still is) extremely tight. He was attending school throughout my entire pregnancy and the first 4 months after they were born. He was gone from 6am to 11:30 every night. Although I live with other people, they aren't trustworthy enough to ask for help.

My husband has been out of school and working at his new job for the past few months, which he has to take to work (an hour and a half away) so there's no option of me driving anywhere to get out of the house. I have a stroller, but our house is on a busy road with no sidewalks and therefore isn't safe. We have no money for babysitters, no money to find another place to live. No money for anything except the very very basics. 

I feel like a terrible mother because I can't take any of it any more. One of my children is going through a shrieking phase, and they don't deserve it. They're babies, they're supposed to cry, throw food, throw tantrums, whatever. I have no patience left any more. 

I'm the only one who ever gets up in the middle of the night to feed them, but he doesn't see it. When he gets home, they're all smiles. He doesn't see what it's like the rest of the time. 

I have no privacy, it turns into a ""Why don't you take one of the kids with you?"" I'm made to feel guilty for needing time to myself. I'm made to feel guilty for leaving my husband in charge of both of them. He's perfectly capable, and I trust them with him, but he doesn't want to do it. I can't go take a bath without interruption from the other members of the house, as we have one bathroom. 

I wouldn't do anything to hurt my kids, ignored, unappreciated, unloved, spat upon, shit on, pissed on, pinched, but i don't know where to start.

EDIT: Thanks for all the support and kind words. My husband and i have talked about this fairly frequently

We've also decided to move, parks within walking distance, and a safe and clean environment for my kids. It's also so much closer to my husband's work, so we'll be able to save 10-12 hours a week in driving time and gas, which makes a huge difference.

1359880243.0,17staw,My brother and I were sexually abused by our cousin as children - I've never told anyone,throwaway271986,33,3,20,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

I'm a 27 year old male and a disabled veteran.  For some reason this incident popped in my head a few days ago and I haven't been able to get rid of it.  I hadn't thought about it much since I was a kid

About all I can do is talk to my dog about it.

My cousin lived two houses from me.  She is three years older than me while my little brother was 3 years younger than me.  She was one of three siblings and was the most responsible one

But when I was 10or 11 things got a little weird.  One evening, removing the towel.

It seemed fun, but each of us did it.  My brother and I giggled from embarassment but we danced.  I hadn't hit puberty and wasn't feeling *those* kinds of feelings yet, but I kept wanting to look at her crotch because I'd never seen that part of a girl before and I was genuinely curious.  She had pubic hair and I had no idea yet that hair grew down there on men OR women.  When she'd catch me staring at her crotch she'd say my name, as if to scold me, and get my attention to her upper body.

This went on for a while.  When she would babysit us, it was a towel instead of a blanket.  She told me that she and her brother had done it without anything in between, sort of daring me to do that, so I did.  

So for a while we would have our strip show game and then get naked and lay on her.  

One day my brother and I were at her house and she was the only one there.  I think she was babysitting us at her house, she wanted to try something else.  Wouldn't it be fun if we stuck our wieners in her pocket?  She and her brother did it, after all, and it was a lot of fun!  My brother and I were both grossed out but she kept on it, daring us and calling us chickens.  So I took my pants off and walked over to her.  She spread her pocket open with her fingers.  I took my little prepubescent wiener in my hand and guided it to her pocket.  I hadn't hit puberty and had never had an erection before so it didn't really go in, it just sort of bumped into it.

""Keep trying, but I didn't want to.  It hurt when I did it the first time and wasn't fun at all.  She tried to get my little brother to do it but he wouldn't give it a shot.

I don't know why but after that incident we never had our strip games again.  We never got naked and laid on her

I'm not sure what coming out about it would do anyway.  Who would believe me?  The other witness is dead.  Besides, I would have no doubt been called a liar and have been accused of trying to ruin my cousin's life or something.  There's nothing I could have done and nothing I can do now.  

Do sexual abuse help hotlines even exist for male victims?  Would anyone even believe that it has affected me negatively?  ",,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/17staw/my_brother_and_i_were_sexually_abused_by_our/

	Here are some events from early on in my life that I believe have had some impact on how I feel today:

1.	When I was six, but I wasn’t allowed to talk about him. I remember lying next to her in bed watching TV and crying my eyes out when she instructed me not to tell my dad, because if I told then I would never see her again and have to live with my dad. At this time, we had Direct TV satellite and my father had a subscription to the “adult” channels. I discovered the Playboy channel (channel 143) when I was 6.

2.	A year later, I rushed upstairs as soon as I got home. I had been watching the Playboy channel every day for about a year without anyone knowing about it. But this time I heard footsteps and I froze. My mom barged in, and she saw what I was watching. Then I was spanked extremely hard. With tears running down my eyes, I pleaded that I’d never eat or sleep again and I would never watch the Playboy channel. I ran to my bedroom to hide under my bed, but I was pulled out from under it to have my bare ass spanked again. The last thing I remember from this event was feeling so stressed that I dragged my fingernails down my cheeks and left lines of cuts on my face (thankfully they healed completely).

3.	By the age of 12 my mom had left the house and it was just my dad and me. I had gained weight since I had been sidelined by a knee injury I had when I was 10. You can imagine the names I was being called in middle school on a daily basis. This was where I had my first murder fantasy. I’d think about a kid calling me a “fat ass” and then stabbing him in the windpipe with a pencil. At home

4.	November 16, right as my dad was logging his lard-ass downstairs. He asked me why I was shaking and I started to cry. Then it got worse. The motherfucker mocked me. He kept calling me a “titty baby” over and over, from the time I was in the house till I was dropped off at the middle school. It was the most mortifying experience of my life. I will never forgive him for his despicable actions. Today I relish in causing him emotional pain by ignoring his phone calls and spending as little time possible with him. I see him as an object that I exploit for its financial resources.

5.	Honorable mentions: Dad forced me to go to church with him from the age of 6 to 19 (waking up at 7:25 A.M. for the 8:30 A.M. service); friends manipulated me and I didn’t care (until recently – I decided to get rid of them by ignoring them altogether); Mom attempted suicide; earlier this year a guy who manipulated me into buying weed for him every day and picking him up from his work that was 30 minutes away sexually assaulted me (forcing his mouth on my penis and sucking on it for 5 seconds before I managed to get up and run).

Those are things that I think have shaped me psychologically. In a similar fashion to the events

1.	Body image: Every time I see a mirror, shoulders, stomach, face). I lost forty pounds in the 9th grade, and I’ve been obsessed with diet and exercise ever since. My body isn’t where I want it to be, partly because of conflicting priorities (e.g. I want to gain muscle so I lift, but I don’t want to get fat so I limit my diet.). Now my biggest fear is losing my hair and rotting my teeth. I run my tongue around my teeth to see if I need to brush and I run my fingers through my hair because I want to reassure myself that my stress isn’t going to make me go bald. I don’t want to be an unattractive bald man with yellow teeth.
2.	Pornography and dating: I watch porn about 3-4 times a day and I’ve gone without sleep on some nights by alternating between online porn sessions and browsing the rest of the Internet. I’ve never had a girlfriend. It’s not because I am unattractive, I feel like I am not ready to deal with the reality of being cheated on. I still obsess over a girl I had a crush on in high school, and I still look through her Facebook pictures and I try to spot her car when I’m driving through town. I always think about how I can explain myself for my awkward conduct with her, and sometimes I’ll be alone and talk to her in my head.
3.	My future: There isn’t a day that goes by without the feeling that I am hanging by a thread. It’s always something. There will always be a deadline with a bunch of errands leading up to it. It never ends. Right now I’m doing well in my sophomore year of college but I’m unsure of my job security and debt after I graduate. I feel like my own death is a deadline of its own. Because one day

There is much more I could put down here but I feel like I have written too much as it is. I would like actual advice and not something I’d hear from an armchair hack therapist. I want to rid myself of this constant feeling of discomfort and begin looking forward to waking up every day.

After I broke up with my first Gf at 14

Fast forward to today, not six months ago we almost split after she admitted having feelings for someone she went to Uni with, and though she tells me she doesn't want to talk to him anymore a month or so ago I couldn't help myself looking through her phone. I found him asking almost weekly for them to hang out or her to go to his place, but the real kicker was finding six or seven sexts from him to her about what he wants to do to her, and while she didn't sext back, after every sext she replied ""Go on"" and then ended with ""Well I must admit you had me hooked :P"".

And now I'm back to the weird-masturbating

Not to mention I've recently embraced my athiesm, not many real future prospects. I desperately wish I had someone I could talk to about all of this, about life and death and religion and my fucked up thoughts. I'm too scared to tell it to my SO lest I scare her away.

and decided I needed to get a few things off my chest. I would've posted there but it seems it has been archived and I can no longer reply there. 

1. When I was young, but not that. We come from the same household and I know that we were kids that were pretty oblivious to how the world works. That boy though, is still in the community. Every once in awhile he comes up and other people allude to what a terrible person he is. I will say something like, ""yeah he is horrible, blahblahblah."" My dad doesn't like him either but once the boy had come up and he asked me why I felt so strongly about it. I couldn't bring myself to tell him because it would hurt my brother. I know my brother must feel horrible about it. But I can't talk to him about it. 

2. I dated a boy about 2 years ago right after I'd gotten out of a serious relationship. He was extremely aggressive sexually from the start, I allowed anything to happen with this guy. He made me feel bad about myself, I barely spoke to him during our entire relationship. We dated for about 7 months. He wold push me aainst walls, throw me into bed, in the street he would take advantage. I would have bruises. He would yell at me if I didn't do things the way he wanted. He raped me, multiple times. He made me feel incredibly guilty if I wasn't in the mood at the moment. I was completely broken and still fear him. It eventually ended because I kissed someone else and he found out. I still miss him and would've loved to meet him at this ""healthier"" time of my life. I feel most guilty about that. 

3. I think about killing myself pretty often. I honestly believe that my life has no bearing in this world. I think I'm a horrible screw up and I will never get myself together. All of my efforts go to trying to better myself but I never seem to get anywhere. I don't have a good job. I think I am an intelligent person and I work hard but I am leagues behind everyone else in the ""where I should be"" category when it comes to my career. Nobody understands why I try to take care of certain people or why I try to be understanding. I see it holding me back and a lot of people tell me how bad it is for me. Even in the above examples I try to help these people to the best of my abilities. I take on a considerable amount of responsibility for my brother so his life can be easier and manageable. My life is not manageable, and probably wrongly, blame my parents for what is wrong with me. They don't really have their lives together either. There are so many factors that keep me from being someone memorable in my mind. I don't think I will ever be happy. I do not believe that is possible. And if that is not possible I would rather die. I often think about walking to the bridge in the bitter cold and fog and jumping off and how little time t would take for people to move on.   It keeps me alive to think that someday that might change, but realistically I know it will not. 

That's all. I guess I just had to say that.

Reason number 1: He convinced me to have a threesome with my best friend. Was in love with him and wanted to make him happy. He couldn't get hard during act for some reason

Reason number 2: He started texting inappropriate things to my other best friend, etc. Found texts on his phone, but of course that was my fault because I was invading his privacy.

Reason number 3: A year into our engagement he told me he has sexual fantasies about Best Friend #1. He said it had nothing to do with me since our sex life was great

Reason number 4: A week before our wedding he has his bachelor party, whatever, doesn't bother me. But a few days before our wedding I finally see him without a shirt on (he had managed to keep one on while he slept which he usually doesn't and when I questioned him on it, he said he was just cold) his chest was covered in hickeys. He told me the stripper kept biting him even though he told her he was engaged and about to be married. I don't think I believe him, but I'm better at sweeping things under the rug and ignoring problems so I let it go.

Every once in a while I think of all these things and probably more that I forgot for the moment, and hopefully I can get some form of therapy by sharing this with everyone. I've never told anyone all of the details of how I feel, I think because I know that they will tell him I need to leave him and I've spent so much of my life with him that I don't know how my life would be without him.

I was raised Catholic in a low-middle income family with mild aversion to sexual topics. My parents are always making sexual jokes and they don't mind if we laugh, they don't shame sex but they are very open about their belief that sex will only lead me to pregnancy which will lead me to poverty and unhappiness. I'm not sure if this has fueled my shame over my sexuality but I do think it has helped it a bit. 

From the time I was 12, I could only watch lesbian porn. I was so incredibly ashamed of that, I would even lie to myself about it.  I would convince myself that I wasn't turned on by the lesbian porn, I was just getting weird feelings because I was straight. From then on, I  wanted to watch lesbian porn or look at pictures because I was so turned on by two women getting off with one another. I tried to ignore my feelings and what they meant because being a lesbian wasn't a possibility to me. I liked men and believe me, I knew I wanted sex with men because they turned me on just like women did.

When I was 14

At 16

At 17, no one has ever told me this or has ever discussed it with me so I can't quite understand why I feel this way about my body. 

no matter where I touched myself, I decided to try masturbating again. I started off slow, rubbing my nipples and getting them hard and then slowly, rubbing myself. It started to hurt, a good kind of pain. It was like small fireworks of pain were exploding out of myself from that small area. I needed more ""fuel"" to get me hornier (cheesy way of saying it, but i think you get the idea) so while scrolling through tumblr, I found a blog of a guy who had recordings of himself getting off. I listened to it and honestly, feeling small spams of good pain until my frustration went away but I was so ashamed of myself. I couldn't understand why I wanted to give myself an orgasm.

And through all of this frustration

I’m confessing this because my inability to bring myself to orgasm has stopped from developing relationships with others.

It is how the diversity of the species is maintained. To sum up Bullworth ""everybody just needs to keep fucking everybody else until we all turn the same color"" or something like that.

I've never cheated on my girlfriend, the longing for ""strange"" is strong in this one. I can't seem to get over it. The longer we are together and more committed to my girlfriend I become the stronger this urge gets. It's not that I want to see what else is out there as far as a long-term relationship, it's I just want the freedom to have sex with any woman who would like to have sex with me.

1343941717.0,xl1mc,I present the world with a fake version of me and I have a few things to get off my chest,confessedthrowaway20,32,6,11,"tl;dr: i play a character in real life and don't let anyone know me

I'm a 37 year old single man with a solid career. No one really knows me. I grew up in a small coastal village in a loving family. I had a great childhood and love my parents and siblings. 

I've lived abroad for a while before coming back to the US to start a real life. I've had a lot of adventures and misadventures

I never felt particularly connected to people. I never understood the standard ""get married, tv, celebrities or any of the other things that so many people invest themselves in, instead feeling such things are meaningless and hollow. 

I spend all of my time building things. I build extensively in several virtual worlds ranging from Second Life to OpenSim. I create and sell wiremesh models on several independent online marketplaces. I have a carpentry workshop that no one I know is aware of where I build furniture and the such

I live on what I will call a ""facility"" on the outskirts of a village. This facility was at one time a machine shop and consists of two connected structures and an out-building. The first half of this structure, which I have converted into a workshop and computer lab, with a dividing wall between these two functional spaces. I use the outbuilding as a studio. The road leading to my facility isn't paved. I have no neighbors and do not want any. Mail isn't even delivered here, I go to town to pick it up twice a month.

I have ""friends"". I do the bare minimum to maintain those relationships. Where these friends are interested in doing normal people things such as dining out, etc, I have no interest in those things and go to just enough to maintain those relationships. Instead I'll go to my lab or my workshop and spend my time in solitude producing things. 

I prefer to be alone. I prefer solitude and perceive liberty in that solitude. My one wish in life is to be left alone to pursue my own ends. 

I wear a mask. I allow no one to see the real me. I isolate my social groups

To maintain relationships, fixing or building PC's for people, providing free ""tech support"", etc. I have bailed friends out of trouble, provided temporary lodging, driven people all over the place, lent them money, helped them with advice

The mask that I show these people is a mask with opinions and tastes that are similar to my friends. I've sat through countless football and baseball games quietly suffering while pretending I was vaguely interested in what was happening on the screen. At least there's usually beer. 

Behind my mask

So while I've stated all of this

1. I secret am a little resentful that these people haven't seen through my facade

2. I am resentful of some of these friends in particular

3. I have no idea why I am like this. I have suffered no childhood trauma's

4. Despite not being able to explain myself

Additionally

1. Sitting in front of a tv watching nonsense for hours on end

2. Investing time and money in narcotics instead of investing those resources in building something

3. Creating unnecessary drama and apparently thriving on it

4. Investing time in hurting and demeaning other people simply because they are a little different or have different views and values

5. The apparent overwhelming desire that so many have their needs fulfilled by goverment AND the apparent joy that so many other people seem to have at the idea of curbing the good social programs that give needy people some much needed food.

Humanity confuses me. I do not understand people

I also concede that I am a monster and am open to the possibility that this fact is what leads the real me to live on the fringe of society. Regardless,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,t3_xl1mc

My gf and I had only been going out (off and on) for about a year and I was never that serious with her - each of us had gone on dates with others that we both knew about. We decided to move in together as a matter of convenience as much as anything else (both leases ending, but she knew I wasn't ready for anything permanent like marriage, and I didn't get the impression she was either. The one thing I did suspect that she was into me more than I was into her, but it was never really obvious.

She is a very sexy woman and we had lots of sexy times, and in any event we both knew it would be difficult if not impossible in our circumstances to have children with my job being phased out in a year (and still big student loan debts to repay) and her obligated to leave the country. So for that reason and the fact that I never thought of her as ""the one"" I was always conscious of birth control. Both of us preferred sex without condoms and I eventually gave those up (mistake #1) but she was on the pill, so I figured the chances of pregnancy were pretty low. Boy was I wrong.

One bright morning in bed she told me she was pregnant. I was floored. I knew the chance of getting pregnant on the pill was less than 1%

She asked me what I thought we should do. I told her I wasn't ready to be a dad, because it seemed like she had already made up her mind.

(Time out: Some of you might say that she may have gotten pregnant on purpose to get into the country, work, or immigrate to just about any country she wants. In fact she had worked in a few countries in Europe for international organizations before we even met)

But back to the difficult choice. I kind of felt like I was being taken biological hostage here. But it's not the baby's fault

I have confessing to do. The confessing is regarding the feelings of self-hatred and sadness that I have tried very hard to supress these past few months at my new job.

These feelings came back to the surface the other night because I went on Omegle. Not a single person took me seriously - they all laughed at me. Girls all acted like they had seen a ghost or a murder and clicked to move on as fast as they could. I can understand that they were just teenage girls and I am way older - and believe me it wasn't my intent to chat with them... but they reacted like I was some monster and not a human being.

Now that I am typing this I feel sort of stupid. I mean

Anyway... our office has a clique. I'm not in it. At first I didn't care

I am good at chatting with people or emailing. I am very witty and funny and make people laugh - they like me! But then when I talk to them on the phone or meet them in person... I am boring. Then the emails stop coming as well as the text messages. It makes me want to cry... why do I have to be this way? I AM the guy on the email/IM... not the locked-jaw weird guy who says random things that don't even have anything to do with the current conversation. 

I am scared because I have excellent relationships with my work partners across the country

I almost want to somehow get out of it because it feels good to be liked and valued. I haven't felt that way since grade school - haven't had any friends since then actually. Haven't made any friends certainly.

So ... any advice for me? I know I am feeling sorry for myself but I am really sad. Just sad sad sad all the time... I can't really help it. It is who I am ... a sad

Please let me at least get promoted to a respectable rank so I can at least tell people I am someone important. that would make me feel more valuable as a person. As it is... I feel like a complete and total loser.

Started dating, flirting, hooking up, and all the other great things about being young. I started feeling better. My mood improved, and I even got myself a female acquaintance

Cut to today. I was on a dating site I started using after my ex and I broke up, the personality which I loved extremely; and upon seeing it, I just broke down. My body started aching, my eyes got heavy, and I really just wanted to rip out my lungs so I wouldn't have to worry about breathing.

I have a best-friend. Let’s call her Gabby.

Gabby and I met on the first day of school and we’ve spent very little time apart since. Even now whilst I’m at university and she works full-time we visit each other as often as we can.

Over the years we’ve shared sleepovers, make-up, clothes all the stuff typical girlfriends do together. I’m like a second daughter to her parents and vice-versa, forever welcome in each other’s homes. Gabby stayed up all night with me when by now ex-boyfriend hit me, she held me when I cried and was there for me like no other friend I had. I even introduced her to her fiancé.

Gabby has a little brother, he used to annoy her when we were younger, and follow us about like younger siblings tend to do. I never really paid much attention to him over the years.

But when he was 15 and I was 18 I started to realise that he was developing nicely. I mostly ignored it until one afternoon when I was over their house, I don’t remember the exact details of our conversation but it ended with me tossing him off (hand job?).

I remember trying to catch him in such a situation again

I guess it worked because a couple of months later I gave him a blow job and about a year later we had sex

Gabby doesn’t know

It’s been 3 years and I still really like Nick, I’m scared that she would never forgive me.

It's even kind of tedious for me to listen to people who are upset at the whole thing because it's like listening to someone go on and on about how you should eat your broccoli because kids starve in Africa.

None of these kids were special.  Not even human life is special- there have been over 100,000 people so far so to claim someone is special seems kind of ridiculous.

The honest truth is that nothing of value was lost.  Most of these kids would have grown up to do nothing with their lives and the few that *may* have will just be replaced by the other million people who would do that job better.  And as for the teachers... seriously, who can fill those few spots.

And as for all the ""Well what if it was someone you knew?!"" I keep hearing... that's different.  I recognize that I'm biased and sentimental to the people I'm close with.  I would be destroyed if my mom died, clever.... or anything.  She's absolutely average.  Just because she's special to ""me"" doesn't mean she's ""special"" to everyone.

I really feel that when people try and talk about it, they'd have so much empathy that they'd be a wreck all day every day.  Because people die all the time and nobody cares.

After a while I'd steal huge packs of batteries (~$20) and those Pom pomegranate drinks (~$10) and cookies and brownies (~$2 ea.) and books (~$10) and I'd sneak into the meat department and mislabel pay $1.75/lb for rib-eye steaks (They're about $15/lb).

If you have more useful stuff to tell me, bible quotes, or encouragement to kill myself (one guy followed me from post to post for two weeks, every comment I made on anything was immediately greeted with suicide encouragement). Like I said, I'm not depressed, just don't want to live a life thats not the one I want to live. Thank you!

I was living halfway across the country and decided to go home after I realized I was really losing it. I began hearing voices. The television would talk to me and I had 3 people at any given time sitting cartoon-anatomy style in chairs in my head telling me to do things and who I could trust. at any given time they were kurt cobain or a boy I had a crush on for years or a guy I used to work with or my long deceased grandfather. I also thought my cat was trying to tell me things. I finally went to live with my mother telling no one anything because even at my most unhinged I recognized that telling anyone would result in at best going to a doctor (which I loath) or getting psychiatric treatment.  I was absolutely convinced there were 3 levels in people comprised of angels and demons and that greek gods from mythology inhabited everyone and were looped through native american folklore in a way I can only barely remember enough to comprehend unless I really tried which I am reluctant to.  Essentially every mythology or folklore I ever read interwove and made a very very detailed web of heightened belief in my head. I was never diagnosed after about a year I was together enough to get a job..for the next few years I still would have conversations with the people in my head and to this day still struggle to disregard what they say.  No one ever tells me to kill anyone or myself and they don't try to warn me that someone else is killing me anymore.  I'm aware thanks to google fu that this is probably some schizophrenia related illness but to be honest I have it under such control now that what I have left I enjoy and I don't want it gone. The most bizarrely comical of it all is that when I wasn't afraid of being assasinated it was actually pretty wonderful.  Feeling connected and powerful and part of something greater thats rooted through the universe.  The part I hold on to the strongest still is this belief that there are really only a handful of types of people in the world (again

 My X girlfriend and I dated for about 4 years. I loved her very much. I had a crush on her for several years before that.
  Well to the point early on in the relationship  she asked what song reminded me of our relationship. I said some song that made me think of her. She said another. 
 The thing is I listened to it a few months ago and got what she meant.
 The song was talking about Somebody not being happy and wanting to break up and not hurt the other person. I didn't like the music she listened to so I had never heard the song until I looked it up.. 4 years later. We lived together for a while and (from my perspective) were general in love. We knew each other very well.  We spent a lot of time doing things together. Movies and dinner. You know just normal couple things.
 Well I know how she thinks
 We broke up and she was married 6 months later. She had been cheating on me for the last few months we were together.

1363844398.0,1apuev,I Have a Drinking Problem and it's Only Getting Worse,itsmeagainjohn,28,5,16,"I have known this for a while; everyone who sees me at parties usually tells me that I am a shit show or sloppy. Even my best friends have mentioned that I may drink too much.

I have gotten into legal trouble by getting a DUI last summer at the tender age of nineteen. It wasn't my first time driving under the influence but it was definitely the last time I have driven since. Even worse I attend a Christian University in Southern California where I have incidents of being reported for drinking. Since I am under 21 and on contract as an athlete they try to hold me accountable. 

The DUI has cost me almost 8

Yet despite all of this I cannot for the life of me put the bottle down once I pick it up. My Irish father's mother was an alcoholic and my Korean mother's side is filled with alcoholics - one of her brothers died a few years back of liver failure. I can say no to drinking until I start and from there it all goes down hill.

I didn't start drinking until I was a senior in high school - my parents never kept alcohol around the house nor did they drink and kept me pretty busy between church

Ever since then I have been out of control. As I have mentioned above I have faced legal trouble and school punishments. I have disconnected with a few close friends because of my drinking habits. I have cheated on my now ex because I got too drunk. I have passed out in anywhere imaginable from Denny's bathrooms to outside in the freezing cold with only a tank top and shorts on. I was denied an almost guaranteed dream summer job of working in a music shop because of my DUI. My blackouts are becoming more and more frequent. The worst part is I feel as if my problem is only beginning to escalate.

Recently I have started ""double-dipping"", with the help of a few other of my friends to the garage and covered me with blankets before going home. 

Strangely I woke up without a headache

Recently I met a girl who I like a lot; she's a straight edge (goody goody) but I know that's what I want in a future spouse. If I married someone like me I doubt it would go well. Anyways she has shown some interest back aside from her constant reminders that I ""need to be a good kid and stop doing bad things"" and the crazy thing is I'm considering it. Nothing before in my life has made me stop and consider if I need to stop drinking yet for some reason the thought of being with her for the rest of my life makes me want to change. Even my friends say that she's worth changing for. 

If anyone's made it this far thank you for actually taking the time and reading a clueless idiot's rantings.

1362726856.0,19wfst,Just some fucked up shit about me,blackbobniggapants,36,13,12,"Once when I was about 4 years old I straight up tried to murder my 2 year old brother with a pillow. Almost succeeded too. 

When I was about 7 and my brother was 4 I was mad at him so I pissed on him to show dominance.

I have a deviated septum from a fistfight I got into in 8th grade, got punched in the nose, both of us suspended.

I broke my foot playing Dance Dance Revolution.

I've generally committed a shitload of petty larceny from communal fridges

I was a pretty accomplished shoplifter of random shit in this small town I moved to- mostly small stuff in the stores with no cameras

I stole probably $200 worth of beer over the period of a few months from a couple of organic grocery stores. Got caught by loss prevention though

Also stole a couple hundred bucks worth of weed growing nutrients and general supplies through crafty ass shoplifting. 

I stole 1.5 ounces of weed and and ounce of shrooms from a celebrity's daughter at college.

Only sold drugs once

I transported 50 pounds of weed in my car's trunk for about 10 miles for $100 once.

I don't even feel bad about a lot of this stuff. I don't think I'm a sociopath though, which stirs things up a bit, gets people out of their usual routines.

I've jacked off in my fair share of weird places like airplane bathrooms. Also while driving long distance in sweatpants (not too common a situation but it happens) I will slow jerk it with one hand on the wheel to stay entertained. I've jacked off under a blanket in the same room as my parents while looking at my laptop

When I was 7 I had a girl friend, being 7. I spent the night at her house and there were bunk beds. She was on the top bunk and came down to me and we started exploring each other. I discovered that girls were, well, girls. Then the lights come on, and her parents come in, and sit us both down and have a talk with us, telling us we can't do that kind of thing until we're older, but the shame came through

I ""wrestled"" naked with my female cousin when I was about 10 and she was like 8. It *was* pretty much just wrestling though

This girl and her friend flashed me their pussies when we were at this party with our parents at like age 10. Ended up trying to get with one of them in middle school and she rejected me.

 I have a fetish for jacking off in broad daylight, mating, breeding, but I have never found a girl who's up for that. I used to live in a rural area and would go to national parks and stuff, and find a clearing, and strip naked and whack it to the fantasy of rutting like beasts in the tall grass. I don't think anyone ever saw me but it was pretty thrilling. Wouldn't do it here because being seen is too risky.

I lost my virginity at age 20, but her pussy was damn tight. Not illegal either because I was in one of *those* states. Have only been with one girl since and that was a long time ago.

I have saved folders of fucked up porn on my computer. Nothing illegal. Just kinda weird and socially stigmatized by people who weren't raised on the internet. Tentacle hentai, yiff... And I don't really hide it well, like I'm just asking for someone to see it.

Generally I identify as a straight male, wanted, taken. I would want a woman in that role though. I am not really into dudes. I've even posted a bunch of pictures on imagefap of myself fucking my asshole with my fingers or a buttplug. I wanted to know what the girls on /r/gonewild feel like, except I have to make due with my profile being commented by gay bros telling me I'm hot instead of dominant bitches. 

I once compared dicks with my friend from elementary school. His was way bigger, but that doesn't clarify much. Long story.

When I was in Spain I encountered a dude just standing next to a ditch on the Camino de Santiago

When I was in India I stood and watched a cop use his cane to beat the shit out of a rickshaw driver who accidentally bumped his rickshaw into the cop at like 2mph. I only mention it because I think it's fucked up that I didn't do anything

On the same trip this ""hijra"" (dude who tucks his sack back and wears womens' clothes and is considered a third sex in India) flashed me because I didn't give her money.

So I have this girlfriend.  She's wonderful, loves popping pills with it, which is a step up from where she was 5 years ago, I guess.  But I am getting to the point where I don't know how to handle it.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will marry this woman.  I love her more than life itself.  But it feels like I'm walking into the abyss when I think about it.  It could go beautifully, or we could tear each other apart.  I try to be supportive, to monitor her legitimate pill intake, limit her exposure to alcohol, physically and mentally.  I've been doing this for two years

I just got out of jail tonight.  Why was I in jail on Christmas Eve, while in one of her ""states"", she became belligerent and violent for no reason I could discern.  I tried to take her pills away from her and she went all catlike, with the claws and the hissing and whatnot.  I subdued her the best way I could without hurting her and took them away from her, but alas, our ruckus had alerted the neighbors that something was amiss, who, alerted the authorities of the same.  She gets up, I did what anybody would do and shoved back, and if he would like to speak with either of us

Her constant drinking and drug abuse have lost us our newborn son, she just continues to make stupid decisions that harm our case.  Like this.  Now I have a violent charge against me while I'm trying to fight to regain custody of my infant son.  She subsequently gets even more fucked up, gets arrested, can't hack it in jail, and ends up being sent to a mental health facility for a period of time.  I have seen to it that she will not be coming home, but rather will be taken directly to a long term rehab facility where she can try to get the help she needs.  This picture paints her as a horrible person, but she's not.  She's the most wonderful woman I've ever been around.  But this monkey on her back has other plans for her.

**TL:DR A long time ago, and alone abroad, I think I was raped(Was I?). I was also robbed and jailed on false charges.**

**Is what happened to me and the associated trauma the reason why I've failed miserably in life? Or is this me looking for an excuse to justify my failings? If you were me, would you seek revenge if there were no legal recourse?**


I graduated at 17 at the top of my class, so he pulled some strings and I got a plum job at age 19 in a foreign country with a corrupt police &amp; judiciary system.

I woke up one morning in my rented room with my rectum throbbing in the worst pain I've ever experienced and a bit dizzy and disoriented(drugged?). The locked door to bedroom was broken; I would lock it from the inside every night. Everything was stolen: laptop, yearbook, childhood photos, passport, birth certificate, social security card, high school diploma, he refused to talk to me throughout the whole ordeal. All of my family and friends welcomed me at the airport; Not him tho

After arriving, and fap. Man alive, was there some serious fapping going own. I was so ""far-out"", lost in the recess of my mind, that I would fap everywhere, oblivious to decorum or even the risk of prosecution. I would discreetly(or so I thought) fap at the public library(no filters, high speed interwebz). Just to clarify, anguish

Oh


At the time, and being yelled at by my dad. When I think of that traumatic time-period, that's what stands out. Not the ""my ass is on fire"" pain. For reasons I still can't fathom, my brain merely registered it, like, ""Ok, so my ass is on fire. Why is my ass on fire? I don't know. More important matters to grapple with."" I swear on my honor(whats left of it) that it never occurred to me, that it might be rape. Not even a fleeting thought.

Let's be real: an ass doesn't just catch fire. Asses don't have a spontaneous combustion mechanism. It's very likely that I am/was in denial. So let me just put it out there: Was I raped? I have zero recollection of the night before that morning. All I can remember is that I woke up to a throbbing pain in my rectum and being a bit dizzy and disoriented. Looked up, and found everything gone.

Some circumstantial evidence:

- When I went to said foreign country, my guard(usually alert) was lowered. Anyway, come to find out years later that the guy was accused of sexual assault which when I dug further found out was attempted rape of a young man. Of course he got off; wasn't even formally charged. $$$ speaks.

- A mutual acquittance would tell me that he personally heard the creepy guy boasting about the robbery(only robbery) and how he had everybody fooled.

- A few years ago, saw me online and started a chat with me. We got into some irrelevant tiff(It's called soccer, cabron. No, futball, maricon), and after cussing each other out, and in order to (presumably, he emailed me a random porn picture of a teenage male on all fours getting railed from behind. Ever heard the phrase, I still vividly remember doing exactly that

Finally, since they broke-in and robbed me, it's very likely that they committed the ""incident"". How? I don't know. Was I drugged? How come I have zero recollection of what took place? Wouldn't/Shouldn't I have woken up? I'm a light sleeper.

After I got back

- Pops wouldn't talk to me for weeks; he clearly could see I was depressed out of my brain, not a single word.

I don't know why I crave the approval and love of a man I literally consider to be lower than dung

- got fired from every job I had. Literally. Just got fired from one 3 weeks ago. Why? I was so antisociall that I dreaded coming into work, using the toilet. Showing up for work and having a work ethic didn't rate high compared to ""just keep on breathing"" and ""god is there no end to this darkness"". 

- ripped almost every relationship I've had (family, fwb) to shreds. I'm commonly referred to as ""obnoxious"" and ""difficult"". I don't deny it. While I can be charming and funny when I ""have to"", I quickly turn into a manipulative a-hole at the slightest hint of conflict. My motto: Hurt others(if they give cause) before you get hurt. Preemptive a-holery

- was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder type II by two different psychiatrist(nobody knows the diagnosis but me). Which explains the brief bursts of energetic and charismatic ""highs"" I had when I would ace job interviews, dropped out college(multiple times), got fired(multiple times), relationships ended(multiple time)

- Cheated on my ever-patient ex-gf. Twice. She doesn't know. 2nd time it was with a married mother of 3. Husband found out, technically, an actual victim(hope that makes sense). I take full responsibility and will be feeling the guilt for the rest of my life.

- Not sure if this is psycho-babble or not, in order to ""force"" you to side-step. I ""won"" because I'm more dominant than you and forced you to change your walking path, even though you had right-of-way. I know it's pathetic, but I counted those as victories.

- Was raised in a very religious, or the ""ass on fire"" incident. No one, except maybe a counselor, will know. I will take it to the grave with me. Thems the breaks.

- became a high-functioning alcoholic which i still am. luckily for me tho, and no criminal record. I hide my drinking very well.

If you were me, and you had the ability and the means to take revenge(whatever it may be) and get away with it, would you take revenge? I am under no illusion that revenge will bring peace or closure or change my life for the better;No; For me, this is almost clinical: I want to inflict the same pain and trauma that shattered a young man's innocence on those responsible; The perpetrators, quite simply, must pay the pied piper.I am the Pied Piper. I am the one who knocks. Pied-Piper-Who-Knocks

Please be blunt and honest. Please don't filter your thoughts. And Please don't ask me about details that I've kept vague for obvious reasons. But if it's something that will help you understand me and my confession better, I will answer. The thing that has allowed me to keep my sanity (relatively) intact is a strong and irreverent sense of humor. Thats my advice to anyone reading.

My brother has sadly picked up a few of these tendencies. He is also gay. His anxiety amplifies feelings of being an outsider and abnormal, all 4 years. Not because he's stupid, but because of his uncontrollable use of video games. His school is really trying to help him and are doing so many things they don't need to to help him move on, yet he refuses because he feels like he's not worth it. He's attempted suicide 8 times and has made 2 serious attempts of killing me out of rage. He's been to therapist after therapist, been suspended from school for making violent threats once to a teacher and another time to a student, and put on various medications. All 8 attempts at suicide were through cutting. When he was 9 he tried to drown me and when he was 11 he attempted to slit my throat for having the tv too loud. Any little thing will send him into a frenzy of rage and hatred of everything that ever dare have the audacity to exist. He has screamed and almost beaten me because i watched Netflix or used the microwave. He is a total hermit. 

My father works long hours and works extremely hard to keep our family above water. He's my idol. Sadly, all of the house work and trying to find a job (only to spend less time at home) is making my life incredibly taxing. My dad resents my brother completely because he knows my brother will never be able to live on his own without a high risk of suicide or rampant substance abuse. Also, because he spent the better part of $45k on an education my brother threw away.

i love my family but because of their adamant refusal of professional help it makes it miserable to interact with them. Talking to them is like walking on eggshells

Saying these things makes me feel like a hypocrite but i just need to get it out there. 

Don't get me wrong, should not have to deal with this anymore. Constantly worrying about whether or not he is going to come home to a dead son or raging wife is not what he deserves. 

i feel like a horrible person

So there it is. i wish (selfishly) that my father would leave my mentally ill mother and brother so we can move forward with our lives.

I attempted suicide about 5 weeks ago, then another two weeks in the psych ward to get started on meds. The meds work a little bit. I don't feel that crushing sensation in my chest that used to accompany my depression, but I still am depressed. I just want to sleep. I have no desire to do anything.

Anyway, that's what I owe so far. The bills just keep coming. And even though my employer was notified of my absence, and I presented a doctor's note, I was still fired. I just got hired part time as a line cook, and I'm trying to find a second job. I withdrew from college last semester because I could feel myself spiraling down and decided that having W's on my transcript was better than ruining my high GPA. The plan was to go back in the fall of 2014 and finish my degree, I guess.

My account is negative. All of these bills are due NOW, but that just makes me feel even more guilty. And I cannot talk to her about any of this because she just shuts down and doesn't know what to say, so I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. It isn't her fault, though. If you knew more about me, you'd probably shut down, too. My county gives me free meds and about 30 minutes of therapy a month. 

Life is worse now than it's ever been, and I should stop feeling sorry for myself, but I just keep thinking about how nice it would be to end it and have it all be over. Every day I get a new bill in the mail. Every day I feel worse. I have no energy, no sex drive (it used to be really high before I was put on these meds), no ambition. 

I just feel like shit because even though I know I love my girlfriend, but the honest truth is I don't feel like this life is worth living, and hasn't been for the past 21 years I've been alive. And she will get over it. She deserves to be with someone who isn't mentally ill, someone who can get her shit together.

I know I'm selfish. I won't deny that for a minute.

I am emotionally drained from things at work. I am emotionally drained from my relationships with men. These things are beyond my control at this point. I am sick and tired of seeing my fat body. 

My weight was taken out of my control when I was in middle school. I was never thin, I never have been until the last year, two friends of friends (both body builders) have bullied me relentlessly behind my back. My best friend stuck up for me, but the other let it slide.

I have also had a problem with self mutilation in the past. My chosen method was razor blades. I cannot wear shorts. There are numerous fat scars on my legs and arms that should have been stiched up but never were. Things have been much better since I really started taking my couseling seriously. It has been nearly 5 years without an alarming cut (small nicks here and there

This brings me to my actual confession. I have traded one form of mutilation for another. I am attempting to control the one thing that I can take back. My body. Diets haven't worked, I couldn't get used to it.

Last week I did it. I figured it out. I am trying to drink more water and have a 100oz mug that is great. I drink one a day. I had drank a lot of water over the course of an hour so my stomach was pretty full from that. I then ate about 8 small eggrolls for dinner. (frozen ones you buy from costco

I knew that it was going to take hours for my stomach to not feel so bloated and horrible. Then I got a thought. What do you do when you're sick and know if you throw up you'll feel better? You know you're going to throw up

I want to be a part of your life. I don’t want to have to wonder why it is that you don’t connect with me. You used to – how is it possible that we’re not getting along like we used to? What is it, girl. I want to be your friend, but I don’t know how to get over you like that. You seem to have been over me since a little while after we said our last I-love-you’s to each other – at least mutually, because I could never stop telling you that I loved you for who you were. 

Perhaps I’m just attached and not really in love. Perhaps I want someone a little better than you were, and I love the fact that you were always completely honest with me and tried your best while we were seeing each other and talking to each other on a regular basis to be a sweetheart. But you never let me get close to you, once you decided that you didn’t want me to be your boyfriend. You never let me back in all the way, and you never really wanted to open up to me. Maybe I didn’t ask you enough, but after awhile it was difficult feeling like I needed to provide all the energy for what I wanted to be our relationship. I wanted you to meet me halfway, and it’s okay that you didn’t. I’m just a little upset, because I still have that as my ideal. It’s not directed at you. It’s not even directed at me, because now I’m not sure if you’d ever come back

I don’t want to get over you, especially when you’re fine with things the way that they are. You’ve always been my friend; I’ve been the one that’s been in love with you. I know it’s tough to deal with me, and I’m sorry. I’m focusing back on myself, trying to make my life into something for my own sake.
 
I’m getting over you

I love you.

I used to have a crush on him in high school, I found it strange he wanted to go out with me. Then

*Sigh*. Ok. I haven't been out for over a month, is over 60, never finished school. I have to pay for everything. I need a night out.

Anyway, I had an inopportune customer"". He brags about his business all night long and shamelessly flirts with M., buys her drinks, pays for her dinner, but not mine. Near the end of the night, I ask him, ""you should show me your shop one of these days"", he says. He takes me home

So, can I come over to your shop?"" Sure, he says. I het home, shower, and change into the sluttiest outfit I can find. No panties, no bra? check. A sleeve-less t-shirt that fits me tight and shows cleavage? check. A mini-skirt that only covers half my ass? check.High heels? check. Seductive make-up? check. I really didn't have a plan up to this point. I was just angry and jealous and was acting on it.

I take a taxi to goto his shop. The driver can't stop staring at me. Gross! And yet

I show up at his shop at closing time. There are no longer any customers and his last employee is just leaving. ""Why don't I show you around?"", processes, costs, products, and I pay no attention at all. Whenever he points at something, I look somewhere else. I just make sure that whenever he looks at me, he can see a little bit of skin.

He closes shop, I ask him. 

""Do you want to watch a movie? I just bought this blu-ray and we can order some food""

We step into his car

We get to his apartment. He lives alone. We order food. He keeps talking boring

We sit in his couch, into his eyes. He tries to kiss me, and I push him. ""Don't"" I tell him. I just wanted to tease him. He doesn't stop. He starts kissing my arms. I don't stop him. He touches my breasts and starts playing with my nipples, on top of my shirt. I don't stop him. By instinct, I grab his thigh.

He tries to kiss me again. I push him, but my hand is now on his crotch. He looks at me, unsure what to do. I suddenly realize where my hand is at, and I start stroking his penis. I look at him flirtly, and he finally kisses me. I don't stop him this time.

He carries me to his bedroom, he replies.

I decide to just go with it. He keeps touching me and kissing me, I am not kidding, this guy is done. We didn't use condoms, I wasn't on the pill. And worse yet, I didn't even get to orgasm. I look at him and ask him, ""was that it?""

Finally, and upset. I feel worse than last saturday when we went out. 

After that, and I didn't say anything. When I leave, I tell him, ""don't seek out M. Don't call me again"".

I take a taxi cab and go home. My mom is there. She sees me dressed as I was and judges me silently. I take another shower and lock myself in my room. I tried to sleep

This morning, a slut that fell into his game, and completely demoralized. I don't know why I did what I did. I don't know why I ruined M.'s chances with him, either. It appears, she really liked him. I feel like I've betrayed her, and betrayed myself. I feel like such an idiot.

I just needed to post this here to get it out. I'm such a mess.

1349531861.0,111huv,After gf cheating and a break I sexually exploited her while manipulating her and her partners for my own sexual pleasure. Got back together and took her along a downward spiral for my dark fetish.,freakyflag,33,10,12,"[verification](http://i.imgur.com/Aekdp.jpg)

While dating and rooming my girlfriend cheated on me while most of my time was consumed by working and going to school

Back then and to this day guys say she's a 10. She's fair skinned, slender hourglass body with huge 38DDDs tits. Most guys noticed her in the reverse order since she's always dressed sexy in revealing outfits. She's fun to be around, loves sex, plays video games, is big into movies, and is definitely a guy's girl.

2 years after the first breakup I was unemployed / working odd jobs while she supported us both. She was getting rides home from a guy who put the moves on her. I was pissed but she told me not to get involved

Still unemployed I had nothing going on and no control over my life. Even though we were good friends I and enjoyed each others' company I tried to get back with her and failed each attempt. Rather then get her back I began manipulating the situation. 

I started with building her confidence in my advice as a friend and a guy. Soon I helped her shop for clothes on a date. She was shocked that I didn't go for something less revealing but went extremely sexy with my suggestions. I befriended whoever she was seeing at the time, and things they wanted. She opened up to me with details and brought the guys home to her room. I became a middle man for her sexual encounters and complete living vicariously through her escapades.  

Controlling the one thing I had control over at the time I was taking her along my downward spiral of what becomes my cuckold fetish and exploitation. She and the guys she was with were unaware of what role I actually played.  A year and a half I saw an in

When we got back together it was a lot of great times but my sexual fantasies in the bedroom involved her both enjoying and being exploited by other men. I told her about my fetish and she was reluctant at first because because she was oblivious to it this whole time. I told her it came about from her telling me all those sexual details and she felt part responsible. We started with threesomes with an ex. Soon just enjoyed watching and a few other exes came into the fold. I encouraged her to meet them on her own. Things got complicated and emotional for her so we took a break for a few months. 

We went back to it trying a pickup bar where I posed as her friend at first and then we'd come clean. It was working out great. Our day up until getting intimate was perfectly normal. Soon I planned arranged meetings with other men through the internet who come by to pick her up. Occasionally I had her find someone through chat or websites. It started as a fetish and turned into obsessive behavior.  

My spare alone time was soon consumed with finding ""meets"" for her that went into extreme detail. I'd buy outfits for her according to what the other men were into. I was witholding having sex with her for months at a time while she meets other men. It soon affected our everyday and I took a break from it while leaving our relationship open on her end.

We're happily married and have been together at some level for over 12 years. I'd say we are monogamous 2/3 of the time. I go into these cycles where my fetish resurfaces for months where she meets others. I try to go for what she's into too (new experiences

1. When my oldest turned one, did we?  I came home from work daily to have lunch with my son, and almost every day she'd taken him to the store to buy just enough 2% milk to give him for lunch.  I found it one time and tossed it, then she started trying to hide it in the fridge.  Since then, I searched that fridge daily and tossed it all the time, which she got completely pissed about because I was wasting her money.  She tried to make me get studies done by people she approved before she'd give him whole milk.  I called the pediatrician in front of her and explained the situation, he damn near freaked out because of how dangerous that could be and said to toss any remaining 2% and only give the baby whole milk.

1296715937.0,feclt,I found internet porn of my cousin (it gets worse),unknownextreme,33,11,10,"I had a cousin, but she was my cousin (though not by blood) and when you're young a year or few of age difference seems so insurmountably large that nothing of any significance ever happened. It was just a friendship.

Anyway, trolling the internet for porn. Being naive and stupid, I believed that it would be less morally wrong if I were to look for porn of girls my age. I'm sure you see the problem with this. Yes, that means child porn. Lord knows how I didn't manage to get arrested or something.

Well, but the tools were crude and you mostly got what you got.

Among the pictures I found a picture of my cousin. Child porn. Of my cousin. She was maybe about 10 in the picture. I can tell exactly where the picture was taken, totally naked, on a beach. 

But still, I'll never know. I can't imagine, from what I know of her, that the picture that I saw was taken with her consent. Most of the adult men on her side of the family were vile, miserable people. I beat the everloving shit out of one of our uncles at one point later in my life, and destroyed my stepdad's car with a golf club, but that's a different story.

As far as I'm concerned any of them could have been responsible. It of course raises questions about what else might've happened to her when she was young. I felt sick. I still feel sick. That something like that could happen to a person I care about.

But I just didn't know what to do after I saw that picture. I didn't do anything, I deleted all of it. That picture is still seared into my mind though, I doubt I will ever be able to forget it.

He hadn't even read the message (Facebook tells you when a person has read a message you've sent them). So I text him after a few days about the job
I asked him if he'd tried resetting it via his email address, I requested a new password for him, went into his email account, changed his password and text it to him. Job done...

I wasn't done, being the nosey git that I am, I signed into those sites (had to get new passwords via his email account) and checked out his profile. He's very obviously trying to cheat on his fiancé with whom he has a son that is less than a year old. I don't know her other than through him and have only met her a couple of times, so it didn't phase me much.

However, naked photos, you name it. He isn't even remotely shy about it, he literally just says ""Hi"", tells them he's horny and/or jacking off and asks if they're interested. I now sign in to his Facebook everyday and read his PMs to all these girls - he doesn't know (or at least hasn't asked me) how to change his password, so it's the same one I changed it to back when he'd been ""hacked"".

Luckily, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time until he finds one that will. A few have engaged in very dirty talk with him via PMs until he shoots his load, then he just moves on to the next girl.

Anyway, just in case he notices messages not showing up as new when he hasn't read them yet (though I doubt he would, he really is that much of a technophobe).

He deletes Facebook everyday when he's done with it. I asked him why and he told me it was because his fiancé didn't like him being on there and he sometimes leaves his phone lying around, before I sign into his Facebook, I check mine to see if it shows his name (profile active) or ""Facebook User"" (profile deleted). I only sign in when his profile is active.

I don't plan on doing anything with the information I have, and I do feel a little bit bad for not acting on this information, because I guess someone should let her know what he's doing behind her back.

He's come very close to meeting up with girls (he works nights and his fiancé works days so he's home alone a lot)

So yeah. That's my confession

He had a nervous breakdown at a high school party about 10 years ago, obtaining an online high school diploma. He wants to go to college, and to have friends, and to have a life, but no one in my family seems to know what to do to make any of that happen.

My mom doesn't think he can work. He's incredibly smart, with no regard at all for time). I think he could hold a job, but I don't know if he could get one that would be fulfilling for him. The great tragedy is that he's disabled enough to not really be fit for a lot of work, but he's unquestionably smart enough to know that he'd be deeply unsatisfied with a job sorting screws or stocking store shelves at night (not to disparage on those jobs).

He has also never had a girlfriend, and makes unsettling remarks about how involuntary chastity is a major health risk, as it leads to high rates of suicide. Now he even avoids watching TV at the risk of a show making light of someone's virginity. He has talked about using a prostitute, just to get his virginity out of the way, but I really don't think that will satisfy him. I think the heart of the matter is that he sees that his life isn't going anywhere, and he is unbearably lonely, and this depresses him.

It also really depresses me. I wish I knew of a way to help him. I'm his 24 year old little brother, I went to college, and I have a job, all things that my brother doesn't have. He needs friends and a life. The city we're in has no public transit, so I wish I could move him and my mom to a city where he could at least use the subway or the bus.

I don't know what to do for him. I honestly worry that he might kill himself one day. I wouldn't say that he's an immediate suicide risk

I'm also terrified that one day, and this will make my own life's progress come screeching to a halt. I don't want to have to take care of him. And that fills me with a deep resentment. And then that makes me feel terrible.

1339695884.0,v1ys6,After a trip...,TAA6142012,24,4,3,"I recently came back from a trip with what I'll just call business associates. We basically split into groups of ten and throughout the week I grew closer to everyone within my group

When I got back home I was very lonely as my girlfriend of a year was still on a trip of her own with her family

My girlfriend got home and I told her none of this as I still loved her and wasn't entirely sure of my feelings for this co-worker. 

When I returned to work on Monday my group and I milled around the office just talking as usual. The woman whom I had developed feelings for and I were much more ""friendly"" than my other co-workers were used to. One of my friends in the office who was also friends with my girlfriend took notice and confronted me about it. I told her that nothing was going on and that we were just friends

In the middle of the week my team had to come back later in the night to work on a project and the woman whom I liked informed us that she had been offered a promotion. All of us were ecstatic for her and offered her our congratulations. She then proceeded to inform us that her and her boyfriend had celebrated before she came in to work.  I was crushed. 

That night I confided in one of my co-workers that I knew would offer advice and who wouldn't judge me. She told me that I should tell her how I felt. And so I did. 

I told her about my feelings and she told me that she felt the same. From that point on we flirted quite a bit. She confided in me that she hated her boyfriend and that she only stayed with him out of fear. 

That weekend I told my girlfriend that we were having a guys only movie marathon

Me and my girlfriend are great now and the co-worker has since left her abusive boyfriend. I still feel bad about having feelings for this woman and I still find her incredibly attractive. 

TL;DR
I had feelings for a co-worker even though I have a girlfriend. Co-worker told me to stay with gf things are better than ever. 

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest. ",,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/v1ys6/after_a_trip/
1337986831.0,u57n0,Unloading my brain. Secrets of a 29 years old man.,trowaiz007,21,1,8,"Hey r/confessions. This is the first time I've been to this subreddit. I saw it tossed around in another thread and decided that I needed to share myself with you (I'm using a throwaway as well). 
 

In my 29 years of living I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of (ashamed works here too). I'd like to get them off my chest and finally hone up to them. I'll keep everything short and sweet in an effort to curtail verbosity. Feel free to ask me anything
 

* When I was younger I would expose myself to my younger brother. He was around the age of 3-4 while I was 10. I don't know if he remembers this. My dad caught me once and had a talk with me. He didn't come down on me, WTH was I thinking?
 

* I started masturbating really early
 

* I started becoming sexually attracted to my cousin towards the end of middle school/freshmen year of high school (so like 13-14 years old). Not sure how it happened but I suddenly realized she was hot (GG puberty? She wasn't even developed @_@). Right around this time my masturbation was at an all time high. I lived with her, I just felt that by doing it I was closer to her vagina or something.
 

* I continued to do this for years, the kind that couldn't finish sophomore year of high school. Coming from the blood heritage I do, losers were not accepted. Secrecy was my friend.
 

* While dating the less than desirable and the subsequent dry spell that followed, oh I have a girlfriend but its not serious enough for you to meet her. Etc. You see, my dad was a real playboy when he was younger and he casts a rather large shadow. I was more socially awkward and very shy. I felt really insignificant and never told him. I mean, he dated some powerful men's daughters from his country of origin, whereas I dated powerfully dimwitted daughters.
 

* While all this is going on I was using my cousin's hamper as my personal spank bank. By now I'd say I was around 17 years old. I would pilfer some of her panties and keep them with me so I could enjoy them whenever I wanted. I still have them to this day and it's been over a decade. I don't ever want to give them up. Funny thing is, ""Oh, let me get my clothes first."" She picked everything up except for the thong she had just taken off prior to showering. I could see it was loaded with juices. I looked at them, then looked back at her. Saw her eyes fixated on my bounty, she stood up and left. I jerked it while eating those panties with voracious, ravenous hunger. I then took my morning glory. I was sure to leave them exactly how I found them. As I left the toilet I could see she had a smirk. I still spank it thinking about her once in a while (even break out the old underwear box). You know what's funny is that she would say things like, ""You have a cute butt. I tell all my friends how cute you look."" I never knew how to respond. If she were to say them now, I'd probably run some pickup on her. Fucked up
 

* Sometime in my late teens, but 10-15 pens must be way better. Then the handle of the vacuum cleaner while it was running...anyway. Finally bought my first double dong, then a few other dildos. It wasn't the dick that turned me on, it was the fact that I was doing something taboo, something wrong but also exciting. It was the same feeling I got when using my cousin's panties. It was exhilarating. Over the course of time, I was able to take the entire 12 inch double dong and essentially hide it in my rectum. This persisted for a few of years (not all the time, just once in a while
 

* I never had a relationship that lasted longer than a few months (most of the time it was less than 4 weeks). I'd lie to people and tell them I was still seeing my now ex-girlfriend even though we had already broken up. College kind of broke me out of my proverbial shell and I became outgoing and sociable. I got more comfortable with the ladies and started to use them for my own desires. After a couple of years doing this I ended up meeting a girl. She was a real winner let me tell you. Our first week together she had her phone shut off, and had credit card bills that were passed due. I don't know why I didn't run for the hills. Instead I helped her get back on her feet (She's actually a top notch person these days. Graduated school, got her finances in order, still has a pretty fucked up affect still but everything else has lined up nicely).
 

* I was totally infatuated with this girl from the start. I stopped talking to my friends, and I was essentially going broke. It was all about her. She was a walking drama man, let me tell you. Her family was a train wreck. Step-father was a real douche, mother was a ditz to the 1000th power, sister married a drug dealer, none of them had education beyond middle school (except for her mother - high school). All the while I was settling for her. My dad knew immediately she was bad news. He said to just use her and get out. I didn't listen. We were together for a few years (note to self, listen to playboy dad instead of thinking I know WTF i'm doing).
 

* I hated being with her but was too scared to leave. I didn't want to be alone again. She was sexy as hell but had ZERO prowess in bed, ""I had a sandwich for lunch,"" and always expected us to go out and spend money to make her happy. Worst part is, when I would treat her out she would treat me to a BJ and by BJ I mean, she'd gnaw on my unit like a goddamn rat chewing on a nut. She cheated on me, broke my heart on several occasions. I was really unhappy. I felt this way after the first year. Extrapolate this over the course of a few years. I never told anyone this. I told everyone that everything was fine and that I was happy. I wasn't.
 

So r/confessions, bewilderment, enlightenment, and even reflection. If you want to ask me a questions feel free. I'll answer them as I get them.

1325466157.0,nz5v2,My parents used to degrade and molest me in odd ways. (long read),JbzzJnes,40,19,12,"I am currently a twenty five year old male from Anderson

My first memory of being molested was when I was five and my mom caught me innocently touching my ""winky-baba"", she made me sit in front of my father while he masturbated onto the linoleum tile in the kitchen, she watched as well. Upon finishing, I was told to clean it up using a paper towel before I was forced to smear it on my mothers vagina while she shouted something along the lines of ""This is what your ""seed"" is for, not for playing with and this is how you were conceived!"". From that day forward, I had a corrupt view on perfectly innocent acts of masturbation that all normal humans engage in.

The next major thing I remember was when I was nine years old. My equally fucked up and grotesquely obese aunt with diabetes and her daughter, we decided to play ""doctor"" and got a little intimate with it. My mom and aunt found me cramming the part of a stethoscope that goes into your ear into her vagina as she giggled playfully (Maybe this was wrong, but I really didn't know any better and had already been perverted beyond belief). 

Immediately, stripped naked and the AC was turned down as low as it would go. We were told to stay where we were until my dad got home, upon which he came into the basement to find us crying. He then proceeded to set up a video camera in front of us and turn it on, then filled up two metal basins of ice water before ordering us to stand in them until we were shivering and frozen to our core. This is where it got rough.

My dad brought the water hose in through the basement door and adjusted the nozzle so that when he pulled the handle on it, my mom and her aunt put a carrot in our butts before subsequently belting the crap out of us. This lasted just long enough that we were on the brink of hypothermia. 

When the terror finally ended

The last thing I can remember was probably the strangest. We lived on a large plot of land on the outskirts of Anderson that was surrounded by trees, made me stand in the yard with the water hose up my butt (turned off, god thank you). I was then told to take a water bottle and squirt water into my mouth every thirty seconds and then spit it out like I was a rotating sprinkler. I had to be as realistically like a sprinkler as I could and every time I failed to do this, my father would ""penalize me"" by peeing in my mouth instead of using the water. If I still failed he would whack my penis with his large, leather belt. This specific task lasted the better half of a day while my parents sat on the porch and laughed at me and hocked loogies on me.

I was made to do other strange sexual acts like stimulating my mothers clit at the age of twelve while a well hung, balloon knot first (no pun intended), between my butt cheeks. He then took pictures and sent them to his friends claiming ""I had blown up a balloon with my poo gas"" (my dad really called it poo gas because he was an immature weirdo, obviously).

Of course, it was just the sound of my dad using a chainsaw to euthanize several wounded swine in the pigpen. One thing led to another and the police discovered that my dad was running an ""illegal pig farm"" on land that had not been zone for agriculture and livestock.

My parents were quickly arrested and it was soon discovered that my father had been running an illegal pig distribution ring for years

Among other things found in the house was a bag of dildo's

The worst part about all this, the chief of police for Anderson, SC at the time, was dumber than Chief Wiggum and Officer Barbrady combined.

I was put into foster care after this and lived most of my life in and out of miserable homes where I was molested and beaten from time to time. Most of the people I'd been paired with were your stereotypical pieces of trash from around the local area. They had less teeth than they had morals and were all wrought with emphysema and COPD. Most of them were in their early thirties and looked like they were on deaths doorstep. I remember not getting much sleep during this time due to the sounds of my foster parents violently hacking themselves to sleep every night.

When I turned eighteen, got a shitty job at a pizza place and saved up money while I lived in a small, windowless supply closet in the Bronx that had been seemingly neglected. During this time, the only thing I bought was a lock to put on the heavy metal door. I didn't even buy a cot or a blanket because I had to sit down to sleep.

I finally got a second job, I got the place at a steal. I only paid nine hundred a month, which is incredible for New York. My landlord was an alright guy but I eventually had to move when he was shot dead by suspected Russian mafiosos over a poker dispute.

I wound up moving back into the broom closet for a while until I could afford another room in a steel Con-ex situated next to what was a dilapidated

I eventually got a job at Balducci's groceries and eventually became a department manager and at the age of twenty four, consoling chat, we found that we're both very attracted to one another. I will be going back to South Carolina soon to visit her. As well, her mother died after slipping in the bathtub about a year ago. Supposedly, she was so fat that she got crammed dead center in the tub and was too weak and fat to pull herself up. When she grabbed the soap holder, it actually broke off. She tried screaming, but as she was alone, she died. Neither me nor my cousin really miss her much

Now I am just hoping to move on

Anyway, the awkwardness of friendships was something I could relate to again. The story, though designed for children; it actually taught me to be more open, face my fears with laughter, and how to be a good friend. Skills someone as depressing and cynical as I usually am certainly need to improve on.

The story isn't all that moral however. Princess celestia, just because she decided to not let dawn break because she was a little sad at everyone being asleep during the night which she ruled. What a bitch! I mean, a thousand years! However, When Luna (the shunned princess) got her freedom, she took the ""two wrongs"" approach, so she's not exactly innocent either. Kudos to Luna for forgiving Celestia in the end.

In this real world, harsh, lonely. Where all I'm encouraged to watch on TV is stuff about serial killers, getting drunk, a million different ways the world might end and a bunch of shit that rednecks do (the discovery channel +nat geo basically)...

1376432557.0,1kb4wc,I feel uncomfortable around my brother,frowabay,31,10,4,"My brother and I are 12 years apart (I'm 23; he's 35). We lived together until he left for college, after having not seen him years

When I was younger, and always wanted to hang out with him (though he didn't want to). I remember that whenever we'd visit family friends he was always the center of attention and I was envious since I'm more introspective and shy. He was never great with grades or set to get a great job or anything, so I never thought he was perfect, but I always looked up to his passion with computers and his charisma. 

It's been a long time since those times now, and he talks in a really nasally and odd-sounding voice. I can't really have a meaningful conversation outside of asking about his experiences in away from home, because when I try he doesn't seem to be able to say anything other than really shallow observations. And he makes a lot of jokes that I just don't find funny, and so I give a pity laugh and try to avert my gaze because it's uncomfortable for me. Normally if I felt uncomfortable with someone, I would just let distance grow between us, but it's complicated because he's my brother and I have a lot of emotional baggage.

I can clearly see it's not that he's changed; it's that I've changed. I knew him only when I was really young, and I just don't know how to. It feels like the older brother I had was a lie, and that I'm the older brother now.

What should I do? I feel absolutely *terrible* (I started crying while writing this). It's not his fault he's different than what I thought he was

**TL;DR: I only really knew my brother when I was really young, and so I just can't relate when I talk to him. This hurts a lot, because I love him, but it feels like my older brother is gone and now I'm the older brother.**

Alright. I was a really chubby, but there was one good friend who stuck with me over the years. We'd fall out now and again (we could both be very stubborn and opinionated) but we always had a good connection and friendship. Sometimes we'd get busy and go months and even years without speaking much, but when we started up again, it was as if no time had passed at all. 

We were friends like this for over a decade. I'm female and he's male... there were times when I had a crush on him

I'm not sure what happened, sometimes, if there was something more than friendship between us... I didn't know, though. I always thought he was the sort of person who would be frank with me if he wanted something to happen between us. I felt that he knew that I'd be willing to explore that.. but maybe I was wrong. I guess that part doesn't matter now, since I am very happy with my boyfriend, but I just wonder if that is why he stopped talking to me. He deleted his facebook. I have his email, but he doesn't reply when I send him messages. He's always tended to 'disappear' sometimes

Everything in my life is great. I've been with my current boyfriend for a bit over a year. The job and everything is amazing... but I wish I could share all this with my friend. I wish I could know what he is doing. I hope he is ok. I hope he is happy. 

B, I am sorry. If I annoyed you or asked for too much, I'm sorry. I can try to be a better friend. If you'd rather not speak to me again, I hope you are happy and well.

What shames me even more is that my tribe has been close to 100% white for several generations. And no one even knows about it. Even all our Chiefs have been white. We white Cherokees also owned slaves. That is even more shameful part of my tribe's dark history.

Can anything be more shameful? Yes! A few days ago, the world didn't even notice. I am truly ashamed to be part of a racist white tribe that gets government benefits because we are federally recognized. This is a huge fraud we of the Cherokee Nation are playing on American taxpayers who support us financially. Of course, the Cherokee Nation will send out this link on a listserv and all my white Cherokee brothers and sisters will downvote me for speaking the truth.

1371495758.0,1gj6yf,Confession about the last week that I have to get out there. I'm just going crazy.,awaythrown3656,26,7,35,"I did this in the form of a very poor short story for some reason. I don't know why. I'm just dying for some response

I don't even remember when we started touching that night. But it was going to happen. We left the house party and went to go eat with a few other people and we held hands on the way there. The others ignored it  We played footsie under the table. We exchanged meaningful glances but we mostly avoided eye contact. The eye contact can be the worst. With the eye contact you know there's more than just lust or drunken fumbling.

After dinner it got bad. I don't know how or why we did this. Our friends were walking ahead, into some office building entrance where we sat and talked and kissed and I curled up against and into him.

I think I said it all. That I loved him, questioned my commitment and motivations for staying with the boyfriend if I have that sort of view. He suggested we go back to his and promised we wouldn't do anything more than we already had. I'm usually not great with promises to myself, but I needed to keep this one.

We got a taxi back to his, he played with my earlobe. As we lay together, he wrapped his arms around me. He moved under my top, which had a tie around the waist and his hand stopped there. When I untied it he made a noise I feel I've heard him make before. It was a bit of a moan of pleasure combined with a groan of resistance and imminent regret, though his hand didn't hesitate. He tenderly cupped my breast and played with my nipples. I don't know when we fell asleep, but it wasn't the same restless sleep of the week before. It was comfortable and warm. For me at least, I may have been pushing him off the bed a bit. I find that funny, I'm the one who's always pushed and he always takes up all the space.

When we woke in the morning we spooned and took turns being the little spoon. I rested my head on his chest with one arm laying against him while he wrapped his own around my shoulders, which I was thrilled with. Maybe my new conditioner works. I did stay in bed, though. After a while, he returned.

""Cold light of day doing anything for you?""

It wasn't. We agreed breakfast was in order and he dressed, but not about the thing that was just sitting there, waiting to be brought up. But it was so enjoyable. If we had been on a first date, it would have been ideal. It was slightly awkward, but interesting and fun and lighthearted. We bonded a bit while keeping it very casual and we avoided touching. I had left my coat at the party and I was cold. We found a place for breakfast that was so much cooler than we were. All the tables were reserved, but we took two seats at the sharing table. There were two women there, one of whom was very American and talked the majority of the time. She took a picture of her food, but she carried it off well.

We ordered and talked and ate. It was brilliant conversation. I don't remember the last time that we talked while sober. We don't even text or chat online. There were times he would say something about ""don't think I haven't noticed that…"" and I realized how incredibly in sync we are for people who rarely converse. Everything we did was completely obvious and known. We really never had a chance of hiding from each other. It took a long time for our food to arrive and it took me a long time to eat. Everything was so perfect and there were fleeting times that I was able to forget the situation and just enjoy being with him. I'm so grateful for that. But of course it couldn't last forever. At one point I said it.

""You know we have to stop doing this.""

I don't think I needed to say why. We'd never really addressed this before apart from that one time last year. But that was when he had a girlfriend and I was single. And it wasn't in person. I know how much I am to blame. I didn't try to make it stop because I just didn't want it to. I enjoyed it too much and no one was really getting hurt. But we went too far this time. And we have to stop. The potential for pain for everyone involved is too great. The one thing I couldn't read from him, sitting side by side. I'm proud of how forthright I was, how I left no room for doubt, but I couldn't have handled it if we were sitting directly in front of each other. Though, there was one thing that I desperately needed him to know, and I looked him in the eye to tell him.

""You said something last night that cast doubt on my relationship with him. But this isn't me being bored in my relationship and looking for something else. This is specifically about my feelings for you and nothing else.""

He has such beautiful eyes

The long walk back together to my car was a relief. I didn't want to be alone. I wanted to be with either him or the boyfriend, so much wishful thinking. And I knew we may not have this kind of time together ever again. I swear that I could feel the physical tear in my heart.

We said goodbye and we hugged. We tried not to linger, to hold him, to be held by him for as long as possible. To breathe ""Oh, fuck it"" into his ear as I grabbed him and kissed him and we stumbled back to his. But I knew I could not and so I let go.

After what felt like an exceptionally long and fraught and traffic-filled yet empty-feeling journey, warm in his arms, I felt happy, safe and comfortable. I thought about him and how happy I was with him and until he had to go to work, I was okay.

Then the loneliness and the doubt and the thoughts came rushing back.

The strange thing about loving two people, it is as though each of them occupies an entirely separate space in my heart, devoted just to himself. Apart from actually being able to be with me, they are in competition for nothing. I don't know what it is in my brain that allows me to physically feel the pain, as though a piece of my heart has been closed off and blocked but is wriggling about desperately trying to reemerge, but I hate it. Maybe it will go away. Maybe it will be like this past year and a half and I'll be able to push it out of sight, out of mind

My boyfriend I met shortly after moving here lives an hour away And is as broke as me. To top it off, or help landscaping).

 
Recently I found another thing that I thought would be pretty decent for me. Another student at my college said he was looking for someone to help him recover from a bad car accident that didn't seriously injure him


I thought to myself ""why not?"". This guy sounded like he needed help bad. I have moderate experience with physical therapy for rehabilitating injuries. I also have a fairly good knowledge of anatomy and physiology


So we messaged back and forth for a bit; he asked if the price was ok


He was right in that i didn't get it all the way; i can be rather naive sometimes. However, but never with that kind of addition. It was late at night when i was responding to it, and i didn't think much about it. i replied, ""oh, well not for that price!"", to which he responded with an offer of $40 dollars for 20 mins instead.


I dont know about the rest of the world, his car, and my dignity. Then i said i would do it.


I'm a very sexually open person, but at a much lower magnitude. The one thing i couldn't stop thinking though was that, in essence, i was selling myself. I felt disgusted with my agreement and resulting feelings about it. We arranged it for the next day where we both hand an opening in our schedule of classes.


The next day, on the fitter side. I don't know what i expected really. It was clear that we were both a little nervous, it didnt seem to be something he did often either.


In his room, mentioning that he cleaned his room and groomed himself to prepare for my massage. Truth be told, i tried to not look so gross myself. It felt eerily similar to a first date between two geeks. His awkwardness reminded me of my first date with my current bf, which made me feel disgusted with myself with renewed vigor.


I straddled his back (clothed, then got to work on his ligament and muscle damage. I asked questions about where his pain was, located the tight muscles that would correspond with the pain, and work out the knots. Thinking of anatomical models and remembering what my chiropractor had told me distracted me from the situation. I talked with him about what i was doing, why i was doing it, and how he could help fix it. We also talked about our lives. In retrospect, it very much reminded me of talking to a hairdresser.


When i got to particularly painful areas


Eventually, he craned his neck around to look at them (as he certainly ""hadn't"" before).


I feared this situation would arrive, i could never figure it out. He proceeded to awkwardly work toward the final objective. ""Can I touch them? Can I see them? Oh, they're so warm, can you put them on my chest?"" By that point, he dropped the pretenses and began touching me in various places; sucking on me, squeezing me - all the while i only sat there in self loathing and guilt.


After a bit, he thanked me and complimented me some more (as he had been throughout the whole time). We got dressed, i took the money of the dresser, and we both went our separate ways to class.


Now i was completely unable to focus properly. I thought about what i had just done



TL;DR- Broke college student (me), and agreed to continue. Basically, feel like a prostitute of some sort.
 
It feels a bit better to get it off my chest.  

I can't stop thinking about if the money is just some justification for some weird sort of affirmation or rush i get out of the encounters. and i can't decide what level of horrible i am for doing this.

I threatened to kill the neighbor kids. I have no idea why I did this.

My sister and I took nude pictures of each other when we were kids. 

We wanted to get married when we were too young to understand what that meant, watched our parents porn together, performed oral sex on each other, and attempted to have sex at one point. I tried cuddling her a few years later, and she wasn't interested. We have never talked about any of this.

We are 21 months apart

Our parents spanked us if we misbehaved, my mom's ""cheating boyfriend"" split up with her and went back to his wife. There was later sour grapes and my mom went to get some money he owed her, he assaulted her. I can't help but feel she brought some of that on herself, but that's another topic.

I have been touching and penetrating myself anally since before I was a teenager. Now I enjoy receptive anal toying, bisexual is alright, and t-girl pron is good too. Some of them are extremely beautiful. I'd probably sleep with a t-girl, but probably not another man.

I don't really talk to my family much. My sister and I share a pretty strong bond because our mom left us alone so often (her boyfriend lived 2 hours away). I wish we could talk about the incest stuff

1340396276.0,vg9tw,I've been obsessed with one of my classmate because I have daddy issues ,THROW_AWAY1lol5,20,1,7,"My dad divorced my mom in December. He left us (4) to live in a small apartment, because she hasn't been working for 17 years and couldn't find a job that can pay the rent. We live near Paris
My dad cut off all contacts. He sent one letter
Anywho, wether if it's being a ""surveillant"" at school or translating things at home, earning just enough money to have food on the table.
Fast forward a bit. So the international school has a lot of rich kids in it, we know better. I try to act indifferently to the fact that her dad is famous. Feel somewhat bad for her, as she still has to doubt everyone who's friends with her. I still hang out with my friends, and watch half the class almost lick her boots. I can see she's trying to ignore it. She's a nice girl, doesn't like to doubt everyone, but you can't help but notice the way she acts when her father is mentioned. Nevertheless, at one point I overhear a conversation with her and some other people about her dad. She says she really hangs out with him a lot. She goes along well with him
At that point all the memories of all the excuses my dad gave me flood back into my mind. I remember all the ""I have too much work"" or the ""the whole section is depending on me"" even the ""if I don't do this, damp basement for a whole night, preventing us to come help her because she had acted badly. He never hit us. He knew that my mom wouldn't accept it. But he still was a bad father.

Anyway, I find myself looking for them, possibly seeing a family moment. I start imagining what it would be like if I had a father like that, I start thinking that all the excuses my dad gave me was bullshit. I start thinking that if a famous guy like him can take care of his daughter, why can't my dad take care of his daughter too? I start wondering about all the moments they could of had together, what it would have been like if my dad did it too. 
Then I remember a single phrase my dad said: ""when I come home now that I'm divorced
I'm worse than furniture to him. I'm worse than fucking furniture.

I still have class with that kid. The last day's Monday. Then I might move over the summer, or having a dad that doesn't care?

She'd revealed to me later that night, essentially without my asking, that they were now sexually open(with the exception of friends, which was never revealed to me but in retrospect I should have figured out before I'd tried anything), it had never occurred to me what I was doing or why I was following through with it but I went along with it.

Well, but we kind of forgot about it after a while. Well we were serious and stuck to it. I was 160, she was 140. At first, her goal weight was 120, mine 120 too.

I have no idea who they are or what their backstory is. I just easily feel sorry for people. Sometimes to the point of where I'm actually crying for them. 

A few things that trigger me are older couples, disabled people, etc. Helpless people, more or less. 

I work in a craft store so I see older people all the time buying sewing necessities and whatnot. Just watching them struggle to hold their bags or take money out of their purses and wallets just really makes me sad for them. I always think it must be horrible to be in pain all of the time. It has to be sad to not be able to remember, or move like they once could. Fuck, old people make me sad. 

Another thing is disabled kids and adults. People with Downs Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy. Since my job ""reaches out to the public"", think it's beautiful that these people get to enjoy this little thing but it makes me so sad to look into their future. They may never get married or have kids or travel or whatever. I have a special place in my heart for special people. I want to one day work with special kids but I'm afraid my  ""too much emotion"" issue with interfere with my future career. 

It's so bad that I actually cried in a drive through line. I was waiting for my food and this person came out with a child (about 2-3 years old). He was holding a balloon and this balloon was the greatest thing ever to this kid. He accidentally let it go and he started crying. You could tell that this kid was devastated.

I became fascinated with vaginas and promptly started reading/learning everything I could about them. Down the line this has turned into a full blown obsession with pleasuring women. During sex I no longer care if I even cum as long as they do. I've perfected my skills to the point that several women have told me they can't even masturbate themselves as well as I can for them. The negative part to all of this is that I have become obsessed with sleeping with as many women as possible simply for the fact that all vaginas are different and I want to experience as many as I can. Sadly this has resulted in me stacking up a rather embarassing list of previous lovers that kind of eats me up inside a little. I always wonder if I'm some kind of freak...

   	There are so many things I want to say to you everyday. But there’s no place to start. No where to end. No way of breaking this cycle
     	I’m surprised to say this. My hands tremble as I type this because I hope it’s true, I don’t need you anymore. Please don’t look back at those pictures of yourself as a lonely, motherless girl and see me. It’s not as bad, but just as true, and what’s done is done. The last thing I really want is for you to suffer. We stand, not mother and daughter anymore, but sisters. Tied by blood and sacrifice. And we belong to the same sorority of suffering. 
	I’m so sorry you never had a mom. That you never had anyone to braid your hair. That you never had anyone to dance with you, I miss you. 
	For years I was just waiting. I waited for you to come out of whatever it was you were in the middle of. Waited for you to come back to me. Waited to be able to talk to you again.  So many times I would try, there was no hand to grasp mine. There was no caring. No laughter. No talking. I was just alone. Reasoning with a stone wall. It’s been ten years. And it doesn’t hurt as badly anymore. But it still hurts when I think about you. That’s why I don’t call. That’s why we don’t talk. That’s why I don’t stay over when I come home on break. Because it’s painful every time.
	This letter isn’t about blame. That’s why (hopefully) you’ll never read it. It’s about being honest. It’s about saying the whole truth. Saying that I miss you. Saying that I’m sorry for wasting the time we had together. I was a child, you’re the only person who’s truly broken my heart. And although I know I will eventually heal, and the pieces are regenerating and reconnecting as we speak, it’s hard to believe that I will ever be whole again. 
	I’ve spent the last ten years experiencing and coming to terms with our separation. The last five years have been the hardest for me. I still needed you. I needed a mom. And you were so starved for one of your own that you failed in being mine. I can forgive you for that. I always have. But I’m here to say that it’s over. I’m no longer interested in a real relationship with you. I no longer need a mother. I hope there is a God, this is goodbye I guess.
I love you Mummy.
I’ll be seeing you.

    4. Where superiority complex comes in
    5. Where sexism comes in
    6. Enough is enough
-----------------------------------------------
^1.
I'm engaged to a wonderful woman and am starting to come to terms with some very fundamental limiting beliefs I hold

^2.
**Personalities:**
    *Me:* extroverted, obsessed with my perception/diagnosis [ENFP](http://www.personalitypage.com/ENFP.html). 
    *My fiancée:* more like an [ISTJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISTJ.html) personality.

^3.
**Example situation:**
I catch myself having a one way conversation when I want to discuss something I think is important. Fiancée becomes stressed and is incapable of speaking her thoughts or feelings without becoming upset. Sometimes I have empathetic body language and things to say

^4.
**Where the superiority complex comes in**
If I'm honest with myself I realize that I often think I have the best answer/opinion

^5.
**Where the sexism comes in**
I treat women and men differently -- I accept more thoughts/opinions from men because they challenge my complex with confidence or argument, not win an argument right? It is one thing to consciously understand this -- but unconsciously? **This is where reddit comes in.**

^6.
**Enough is enough**
I refuse to subject my fiancée to this stuff and wish to seek help. Why settle for topical treatment (conscious efforts) if there is a way to attack the root (unconscious changes)? I think I need a therapist or hypnotist to fundamentally alter these limiting beliefs.

So a guy is digging for treasures... or in real life I am putting my spoon into my cereal and eating it. The brown cereal is dirt. The goal is for the guy to dig up rare ""stars"" (star shaped marshmallows). Unfortunately he runs into ghosts, like in a video game. When I get the star, I win. So here is what I have to say in my mind when I get each marshmallow (I apologize for the stupidity of this.. but I don't know what else to do with this strange confession):

lighting bolt ""AHH! a lightening bolt!"" (imagines electricity noises. guy dies and fails.)

ghost: ""AHH! a Ghost!"" (hear a ""booo!"" I lose the ""game

Bat: ""AHH! A bat!"" ... no real imagination with that one.. accept maybe some flapping.

Star: ""ooooo! a star!"" He has found the ""gold"" and has won the game!! This will make the boss happy!

And it is ESSENTIAL for me to end my last bite of cereal with a star marshmallow. there is no other way. The thought of ending with something else just makes me feel totally uncomfortable.

perhaps they should make a real video game out of it

I used to be a fatass from age 8 onwards. I've toned my body and am now in stellar shape but I have fucking scars all over my skin. You literally cannot find a spot on my lower torso - front

Being a fatass, never had the balls to ask girls out. My secondary school experience consisted of hearing about my friends experience their first kisses, first loves, first hand-holdings, losses of virginity, etc etc. Sure, they all broke up eventually but they still remember those times fondly

Fast forward to senior year of college. I'm now in very good shape but I think being involuntarily celibate for so long has taken an impact on my personality and behavior. I try to flirt with girls but it's like I have an aura of repulsion around me. They usually force conversation and then move away quickly at parties. No girl has ever willingly been alone with me in any context.

I think this is because not experiencing teenage romance has severely fucked me up in the head. I get depressed and frustrated at myself, enough to be in a relationship. Relationships are a factory now. People settle.

I don't want to be someone's 10th or 20th lover. I want to think of kissing and sex as a special thing. I want to share my ""firsts"" with someone who's inexperienced like me.

When we first were together you told me I was perfect, you decided I was less than perfect. You became frustrated with me, and started picking at my insecurities. You told me everything that was wrong with me and my body and face.. You cut me deeper than I've been cut in a long time. You started hurting me physically, too. It's been more than once and you don't even pretend to be sorry you did it anymore. You just tell me how it was my fault, how I was asking for it, and how I could have prevented the injury. You're sorry that I got hurt while you were pushing, shaking, shoving
I'm at war with myself. On one part of my brain, I see me trying to fix myself and help out, and be a better girlfriend, and it gets discounted. You get mad at me for the same stuff you do, and you're so judgmental, I'm afraid you may get hurt if you fall off your high horse.





I'm not sexually satisfied, but good god, you and I when we work, we work perfectly. We can go so far together. I want to hold out for therapy and see if it gets better, but darling, I can't. I'm going to end up committing suicide if I stay with you, I'm sure. I believe all the bad things you say about me. And when you told me that I'm the cause for the lifetime of abuse I've had... Well maybe you have a point. I am the reason. I got you to hurt me when you've never hurt another girlfriend physically.




You are my sweetest, my greatest weakness. The man who's made me cry the most, and who's saved me. The man who throws me to the floor, tell me its my fault you did it and my fault that it hurt me, only to tend to my wounds later, wrecked with guilt, and having me tell you that its okay, you were right. Oh, do you? You've always had such a healthy self esteem.





Well, I was being abused then and it was ignored and I'm being abused now, and I'm ignoring it.





I love you is not enough, harder than anything I have ever done. I feel like a failure, and that I'm walking away from the best thing that has ever happened to me... But you're also the worst and I can't fix you.

2. I believe politically correct bullshit only further emphasizes that we are different. ""Oh shit, how's it hanging."" To which he should make a wise crack about his penis. Hilarity ensues. Stop worrying about this and stop bitching about terms for people. Humans are humans, fuck trying to figure out names that ""correctly and politely"" explain their differences.


3. Progress is slow, its GOING to happen. Get over it and stop bitching. A mass population is like a child, you have to let it come to its own conclusion and mature. If you try to force it to mature, you just make it fight back more. Anyone that has ever tried to feed a child vegetables can attest to this. Full human rights for all people is a vegetable. It's healthy, we need to eat it but by damn a lot of people are going to huff and puff and cover their mouths. Guess what, those people are mostly OLD and will die.

Think a remake will be bad? Then why the fuck are you lining up to pay 12 bucks to fucking watch it and bitch. You are just feeding them!


6. On that note, you would hate it as much as you hate everything made for children today. I mean really, have you seen the shit you used to watch? I remember how awesome ninja turtles were, I totally smurfed with the smurfs, but guess what, they were fucking awful shows. Honestly, I'd rather sit with my kid and watch spongebob at this point than some old turtles episode.


7. People should be required to take tests on parenting before being allowed to have children.


8. Pot should be legalized


9. Suicide. Just fucking do it. Stop threatening.


Either you are serious about it then you disgust me. Have you seen what suicide does to a family? To your friends? Don't care or think that no one likes you. Fine, there tons of people who are living your life, have lived your life and dealt with your shit. Guess what, some of them bitched, some of them slit their wrists and some of them nutted up and dealt with their shit.

You think my life was easy? You think that guy next to you on the bus had an easy life or all the other kids in your class. Guess what

Chemically imbalanced. Yeah that sucks

If you aren't serious and need attention then jebus claus this is the most pathetic disgusting attention ever. You wouldn't be more pathetic if you threatened to shoot up a school. 

Suicide is not funny, it HAUNTS your loved ones and friends for years. It's one of the most selfish and awful things you can do to the people that care about you.

After getting trashed I told her boyfriend that he could stay at our place in her room since I knew she wouldn't have minded. We both continue to get drunk and close out the bar. We took a taxi home (at least we didn't drive drunk) and once we got home we kept drinking and decided to smoke a bowl. After that it get hazy, hair pulling, she's also one of my only closest friends. Both her bf and I decided not to say anything to her and say we came home and ended the night after a shot. But I'm feeling terrible and I'm not sure what to do. They have an amazing relationship and I like him a lot as a friend. Should I let a drunken mistake ruin their relationship and probably end our friendship?

Also from this I want to stop drinking. This isn't the first time I've ended up at home with a guy from a bar. Luckly they have all been random men and not my friend's bf. But I end up having sex when I reget it in the morning once I've sobered up.... So I think drinking is a HUGE problem for me.

My sister and her husband are hard working but they're a single-income teachers'-wage household with two kids. I know that they pretty much live paycheck to paycheck as it is and that going to a restaurant where you'd spend $125/couple would really be a stretch.  However

The big night comes and we all have a wonderful time. My mom insists on paying the entire bill, oblivious to the arrangement I had worked out with my mom, begins to protest and my mom replies, ""relax, this is your birthday present!""

I'm a coward and a lazy piece of shit.  If not for him, or get to work on time.  I'm thankful for that, and I love him for that, but my biggest fear is marrying him and realizing years from now that it's not what I wanted.  I can't take time back once it's gone by.

Our sex is not fulfilling.  I'm dreadfully kinky.  I have a massive bondage fetish.  Vanilla sex cannot get me off.  God, I can't.  I'm stuck with this.  After years of trying to explain, he sort of knows what I like, and he'll do it for me, but I have to beg and barter for it.  I don't blame him for being bad at it.  It's not his thing.  He's never going to be a natural dominant. I'm always going to have to stand there and tell him what to do.  I'm never going to know a true submissive role with him.

But like I said, are astronomical.  I already spent years trying to explain my desires to my partner and I don't want to have to face starting over.  Please understand, it's very uncomfortable and  baring to sit in front of someone you want intimacy with and have to explain what kinky shit gets your rocks off.  It's embarrassing when it turns into a goddamn psychology lesson.  Every funny look, every failed attempt hurts deeply and you can't show it or else the whole show stops.  Why does it have to be so complicated?  Holy fuck, I wish I were normal. 

And I know I prefer women.  It's taken me years to admit that, pretty curves of a woman so badly.  I like his hair long because sometimes I close my eyes and just nuzzle into it, pretending.  I hate myself for this, too.  All I have to do is marry him and I'll have a nice, normal looking family.  I know pride is on the rise but I've already had my ass beaten once.  I remember the blood and the pain and my mother's sour face.  It's hard to let go of the fear. I don't think I can.  

Sometimes I want to just pack up and leave.  I want to go somewhere far away from here where the LGBT community and the leather community are alive and thriving. Maybe the girl I want is out there. But honestly, I sometimes don't even leave the bedroom.  My roommates make fun of me and they should, but it hurts.  They don't understand what it's like when the world outside becomes stale and unappealing.  

I went to a bridal open house.  We watched a wedding fashion show and it just hit me hard.  I don't want to wear the dress.  I don't want to be the bride.  Later, wondering what the fuck I am doing.  I don't what to hurt him, but it hurts me.  Every goddamn day, it hurts.",,False,,False,t3_1att3v
1363481664.0,1aftju,"So, this is a first time I'm doing this. Well, I have a confession.",crazyjavi87,22,4

I'm twenty-one. I'm a student at BCIT, and a happy family. So what is there to confess?

I'm alone. I have good friends, I lie, and pretend nothings wrong with my life and worry. Worry about tomorrow.

Worry about what going to happen to me, say he has no money, and have my brother come home from Calgary after a month and tell him he has a savings account with fifteen thousand dollars in it.

Which brings me to my brother. My brother is a genuinely nice guy. Blunt and rough, and, like everyone in this family, adds fuel to the fire when there's an argument.

Then there's me. The cheerful, and family at the same time. 

The one who feels he's always alone because almost everyone he knows is better than him in every way. I'm not a good person. People tell me I'm a good person. I'm not. I lie every day, I was bullied alot. But I'm sure alot of people have been through that, probably worse then me so I never complain about it.

But it's the fact for almost my entire school-life, ask why I wasn't like a student like him.

My mom would say stuff like that in an argument when she got angry, it followed me. I went to an entirely different route of life, it followed me. My friends know about this and try not to do it, but sometimes it slips and it upsets me. But all I do is smile and say it's okay. It's okay.

It's okay. Always with the 'It's okay.'. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of saying it. I'm tired of lying about it. It's not okay. It's never okay. I fear each day for tomorrow. But I don't have anyone to complain to

All because I don't want them to worry. So I made myself into the cheerful guy who never get's upset or angry. Who always smiles

I wonder what would happen if I was never here. Maybe my brother would've gotten his shit together. Maybe my mom, have been slowly increasing over the years. Even recently, I feel that I'm slowly breaking apart. Just barely holding myself together in order to move forward.

I have no dreams

I'm a liar

But even so. This liar will keep lying if it'll keep my mom from breaking

That's all I really have to say and confess.

I knew I was at the time, like most abusers, it made me feel powerful since with a few words I could turn this girl, this girl who I loved at the time, miserable. And like a lot of abuse-es, she didn't leave me.

Sometime i could feel a little voice in my head telling me ""You don't need to do this. You don't need to hurt her or make her feel even worse."" but I blatantly ignored it.

I truly felt as if I loved her, but that I could also toy with her.

Just like the innocent voice telling me to stop, me to just all of a sudden tell her the truth about the kind of person I really am, just to see the expression in her face. To tell her ""I don't actually love you you dumb cunt, you've just been a toy for my amusement."" and then laugh about it. It would be during times when I would be comforting her and making her feel better, and that urge to say ""I don't actually care about you."" stone cold to her.

I dunno, and then the other side who didn't really care for her and even manipulated her on a number of occasions.

 It wasn't until middle school that I started to realize I was being abused. The sound of a belt buckle still scares me to this day, but eventually the door would be broken down and I would be beaten even worse. I remember looking at myself in the mirror, my boyfriends black shirt torn at the collar,  blood on my forehead, my eyes puffy and my cheeks covered in tears, my hair in disarray. I was the typical image of abuse against women. I'll never forget. He choked me once to the point that I blacked out and fell to the floor. When I came to, I couldn't even remember my name or who I was. That peaceful moment of unknown made me more accepting of death.

In middle school I had lots of suicidal friends who cut themselves daily. I didn't blame myself for the atrocities I'd suffered

My father would befriend my friends parents and then borrow money from them without me knowing. He would tell the neighbors I was in the hospital and he needed money to get me. If family members asked where my new gameboy was

I had a high school sweetheart. It was the happiest I've ever been in a relationship. It was romantic, spiritual, fun and positive. I can die happy knowing I was once so very much in true love. However, I will always feel guilty about how I attained this love. I broke up with a close friend of his in order to date him. I know that this led to the greatest love of my life, but I will always feel like a bad person for putting someone through something so traumatic. It is one of the most fucked up things I have ever done.

When I started college, my first year, gone. Pictures from high school - senior trip, prom, old middle school photos, all of that was gone as well. Mementos I will never be able to bring back.

My mother is a real piece of shit. I told her that she had to kick him out or I was leaving. So, too. We were both depressed and would spend endless days locked up in his bedroom smoking pot.When I go back to visit, I still feel as if I've finally arrived home after a long journey. I would cook for him and give him hand and feet massages daily, no questions asked. I used to love pampering my loved ones. Perhaps I still do, but I am too afraid to act on the instincts. I can still remember how he didn't appreciate any of it and it hurts.

I was depressed the entire time I lived in Manhattan, never even got into a fight, didn't have to repeat any grades in school. What did I do so horrible to deserve to be tossed away? When I did see her, she would call me stupid, dumb, idiot, moron - no matter how successful and intelligent I was. 
The pain of all my past gnawed at me that entire year. I avoided visiting my parents for most of the time that I lived there. When I finally did go visit

Now, he constantly took me for granted and I knew I deserved better than that. My mother is never nice to me. Both of them have let me know that they wish I wasn't born and that I am nothing but a burden. They let me know in middle school that I was supposed to be aborted. 

Luckily my father has nothing left to steal from me. I sleep nearly on top of my iPad and iPhone. I take both wherever I go - even the bathroom. I have no choice. I am still an artist
 I have a natural talent and I don't know what to do with it. Still, I am engrossed.

He's losing his mind

I'm losing my mind, and yet I get none in return. Its my own fault because i do not ask for help when I need it (because I am used to rejection and people being selfish). 
Luckily

I'm dating someone now who I'm not sure about. He has already cursed me out and disrespected me in unforgiving ways despite the relationship being so new. I don't know if I'll be able to forgive that - it's too much of an echo of the abusive past I have already lived. I want a sweet man who is kind hearted through thick and thin. I am tired of trivial arguments and crying. As cliche as it sounds
 I'm also convinced he isn't attracted to my entire body. He's used to beautiful white women, but the insecurity is there regardless. So, I don't know where the relationship will go, but I do know  he makes me happy in a big way. If he didn't have a mean streak, things would be perfect.

It started after we put my little brother to bed. 

He said that he wanted to show me something, and having always enjoyed learning new things totally bought it. I laid down, I think he told me to take my pants off and my underwear too. He began by gently blowing air on my penis. It was cold and felt great, unlike anything I'd ever felt really, and began to get erect (as erect as my little penis would go, at least). He kept asking me if it was ok, if it felt good and I kept saying yes. We never kissed, just laid back and enjoyed pure new sensations. He eventually sucked me a little bit

At some point when I had made it clear that everything felt super good and was really excited about it (I even wanted to wake my brother up to show him these new amazing things (and feel awful about that))

At this point I realized that there had been a terrible misunderstanding

I tried to avoid mentioning anything as long as possible, and told her what had happened. She kind of flipped her shit, we went to the police, and there was a hearing but I didn't go to it. I know my father was even more pissed, and pissed at my mom for letting it happen and everything. 

The weird thing is that I don't feel bad about it at all. I enjoyed myself and if it were a normal part of growing up I think that that would be completely fine. I consented and enjoyed myself at every point, and I could have stopped it at any point. 

The thing is that despite my ""consent"" it has fucked me up a bunch, or the police or something. How I really should feel terrible, and taken advantage of, while just a powerless little child. I know this might seem ridiculous but the worst part came from telling my mother. If I had known what I know now, I would have kept it a secret so we could keep doing it, **fuck society**.

I don't get a lot of this form of emotional expression in my life, and irreversible as some of the stuff on spacedicks, I am almost FORCED to feel the most extreme form of empathy for these people. They were people who didn't choose to live in some fucking third-world country, who are probably better/stronger people than me. And yet there they are, suffering from an electrical burn that has destroyed their entire lower body, or a disfiguring crash. I don't see a lot of things that are authentic and deserving of such extreme forms of empathy and human emotional response in my privileged life. So when I get the opportunity, I feel for them. Because they deserve it. 

Also, for fuck's sake. Now they're dead, and there are seven billion other people who don't give one single thought about it. I think of all the suffering in the world done by those who don't deserve it and who go unrecognized. Whose suffering has meant nothing because nobody has/can see it. And it makes me sad. Deeply, truly sad that these people will never be remembered, and that their lives are forgotten so quickly. It seems unjust to just let someone become forgotten like that, and that is why I watch /r/spacedicks.

Then it was time for stock take and alarm bells went off and they vamped up security. One night they decided to do a random body check and that's when I got busted for something of very little value. Fired on the spot and got taken to a police station under that one item but they must have known it was me. Few days later I get a call from my ex-employer saying they found my ebay account where I sold all the stuff I stole. Said if I'm willing to pay $30k in damage they won't report it to the cops. I don't know if I actually stole this much but it was definately $10k+. But it put a lot of pressure on the family to pay it and had to borrow money from family friends. Don't know if they know the truth or even whether my siblings know.

After a few weeks I tricked my exchange student staying with us into giving me money over the course of a few weeks. I had used a key logger on his computer and accessed his bank account to send money to myself. Then I would tell the student that I need to withdraw money but can't because parents are checking my account. I would show him me transferring money(originally his) to his account

Few weeks later I got several big bags of cashew nuts and labeled them peanuts(you write the code on a label) to get cheap cashews. Casually told my parents without realising who told me to stop.

Somewhere along the time line in between one of these events I occasionally stole money from parents wallets. After a few times they started commenting out loud that they appear to have misplaced money and I realised how obvious it must have been and stopped. They must have known but never confronted me about it didn't last long.

Needless to say after each event excluding the last

Motivation? I already stated I was just young, as a SAP I got moderately popular just for owning all the trendy gadgets and this made me feel beter about myself. Decent car, made it look nice with rims etc, paid several thousand to replace my sound system with amp and sub woofers etc. Several ipods when they first came out, 2 laptops, psp, expenssive watch

Some are pretty regular, I've been acknowledging that I get really turned on by watersports pics and videos. I didn't mention it to anyone. Most of my former online friends with benefits weren't into it, nor was my RL woman. And I was quite ashamed of it. So I kept looking at the videos and pics online. 

I also like to venture onto Omegle and find a female companion there (not by sticking it out at the cam, I'll find a playmate. About two months ago, one of them surprised me (without my mentioning it) and took her laptop to the toilet with her, taking a pee on cam. Oh wow, talk about turned on... It also made me want to experiment. A few times, I'd drink a lot of water and get off on Omegle or to porn for a while, then played with my pee in the bathtub before cumming. I always felt horribly embarassed. Then, after subtly placed questions

Yesterday I sat in my chair by the computer, too shy to ask still) if I could pee for her. I let a little bit into a glass, then, horny and curious, let the rest of it all over myself, shorts, chair and all. While peeing, but it felt very much like the second (and a lesser) orgasm to me.

1317688015.0,kzy6x,I think I'm gay. Or Bi. Or I don't know. ,ImightBeGayToday,15,1,6,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

So here's the deal. For as long as I can remember, at most. I've always been attracted to both men and women, but more instinctively attracted women. However, I have fantasies about men all the time, but never act on them. I've never been with another man, and am quite honestly petrified to act it out. 

Here's my History: I was in a long term relationship with a woman, I never wanted to marry her because I knew I could not get along with a woman for the rest of my life. I find women to have a great sense of empathy and emotional understanding, but I just do not, and cannot completely relate to them. On the other hand, I have this amazing guy friend. Let's call him ""Q."" Q and I have been best friends for over 12 years and I honestly never get sick of him. I can listen him talk about anything forever. I've been there for the best and worst moments of his life, as he has for mine. I've seen him at his best and I've seen him at his worst. We tell each other everything, and it's the closest, I think I could spend the rest of my life married to this guy. I could spend all day

So I guess that's my confession. I could very much picture myself married to a man, because like I said, my libido has a faint heartbeat. But at the end of the day, I'd rather talk to Q, than any woman. And while women are great, don't get me wrong, I've only had sexual experiences with women

So what gives? Am I fucking crazy? Are there some questions that I should be asking myself? How do come to terms with this? Is it strange to float in the middle between sexual orientation?

When I was quite young, making me feel as if I was no better than a spec of dirt. 

One day we got some cats, I am what you might describe as a introverted weirdo, so I never had any sort of release for the anger and confusion that was building up in me because of my fathers daily abuse. Whenever my cats did anything wrong (and sometimes when they didn't) I'd scold them, but part of me would enjoy releasing the anger, and part of me enjoyed having power over something, so I'd scold them for much longer than I had to, usually up to 5 minutes of tapping them on the head when they tried to get away or shaking them if I happened to catch one. I never did any lasting damage or broke or cut anything and would always feel like a monster afterwards and to this day that time of my life still haunts me.

A few months later, but I think I was a little too full on with it as it ran away under the TV stand. I don't know why but some predatory instinct kicked in and I decided to chase after it. I reached in and pulled the kitten out, but it scratched me. At that point my anger flared and I threw it away from me. At the ground.

The image I see when I remember that day always brings tears to my eyes, clawing at everything. I thought he had gone insane, like I'd broke part of his brain or something. I soon realised that I had actually broke his spine. He was dying and all I could do was sit there and panic. I tried to give him water or food, I was panicking, ""what have I done? what do I do what do I do?"". I considered just throwing it away and saying it ran away, but I imagined the neighbours dog finding it and being put down or something.

At this point my father returned, but he seemed to believe me. The kitten had calmed down now, and I sat there as he died.

I have never been cruel to an animal since that day. I have since moved away from my father

There is nothing really wrong with me. At least


I'm a fairly old-fashioned person. I don't like one-night stands or fooling around. That doesn't mean I'm a social pariah - far from it. I get along fine with women (if I had to say, but it has never escalated into anything further as I just don't let it. If I had to examine my love life, I'd say that I've been asked out 3 times in the past decade, but all three I chose to turn down because I didn't feel comfortable or it just didn't feel like the right time. There was always something preventing me. Work. Family. Travel, etc. It just never seem to be the right noment to jump into a relationship. After a while, I started to avoid it just out of habit.


It's funny how one day you wake up and you realise an entire decade has passed you by and that horrible sensation that *another* decade could roll by and you wouldn't feel it because


But I do get lonely, where I sit back, take stock of my life and realise that deep inside, I am very lonely. That I want to have someone to share my life with. That my home is just too big for just one person, and that I would love to talk to someone about my insecurities and my doubts and my silly urges. But I just can't bring myself to do something about it, you know? I don't know how to even do it anymore. And when it gets really dark, when I am about to drift off to sleep, that's probably the case.

I've (19M) been driving for 4 years now. I've always loved driving. Been driving lawn mowers, anything that had wheels, I'd drive it. I loved driving. I wouldn't speed more than 3-4 MPH over the speed limit. I worked on cars constantly for fun. I loved the feeling of being behind the wheel with a 300hp engine and the windows rolled down blasting anything thats on the radio. Loved it. 

1 month ago I was on my way to my new job (been working there for 2 months at this point). Its about a 45 minute drive from my home to my work. I'm driving in my brand new (new to me) car that I just bought 1 month ago. Couldn't have been in a better mood since my birthday was a weak ago. 10 minutes out from my work I take a right onto a country road on the peak of a hill. As i start driving up tot he speed limit (55), with a dip on both sides. Eventually we hit a straight away so that the asshole could pass, which he does. Stunned by this I stare as he speeds off. Next thing i know, I look into my mirror with a cop with his lights on behind me. I am releived on the idea that the cop just saw all of this. NOPE. He pulls me over, doesn't believe my storie, and gives me a ticket. (69 in a 55).

Ever since, if its a the same shape, I still freak out. That 45 minute drive has turned to absolute hell. I'm taking a little over an hour to take that same drive. I'm now that incredibly slow asshole who nobody's likes. I'm that person I always yelled at in my car. I hate it. I hate is so much. I avoid driving at every chance I get.

1373304490.0,1hvj0j,My best friends dream...,JoNnYtHeUnKnOwN420,17,6,9,"Well here is a little back story first. I'm 19 M and I'm a simple guy with few friends and one best friend(we will call her Mary) I've had for almost 3 years now and a GF I've been with for a year and some change. I have always had a thing for my best friend because she helped me through a past relationship with her former female best friend that ended badly and caused them to stop being friends.   
  
So back to Mary's dream. She text me after about a month of us not talking, 'what do I get if I do take you?' So me being me I said 'well what do you want?' she then slightly blew my mind saying all she wanted was for her dream to happen. I was speechless due to me having the feeling for her I have always had. Then we proceeded to talk about our feelings about each other. Then we decided we should find a place where we could 'make her dreams come true' (yes I know the pun was bad) So this is where I get caught up because we are both in faithful relationships, except I don't agree with hers due to her bf getting her hooked on drugs (I do them too but she does one I don't agree with, but I still don't judge her) and we both agreed to keep it a secret for the sake of our relationship.  
  
So is it bad that we are doing this? if not is it bad that I would want it to become more? and finally a side note I forgot she has a baby (she's allergic to latex) that I love like a nephew   
  
Thanks for your time and any and all advice is welcome

Aside from my last confession about caring too much for strangers

Long story short: my best friend's friend just had a miscarriage. My best friend called me tonight and told me the news; completely a mess. She's also pregnant and was so upset that I instantly thought that she herself miscarried.  That I would've cared about. 

I felt no emotion for Theresa (best friend's friend). I literally did not care that she wasn't going to be a parent anymore. She was pretty far along. Twenty five-ish weeks I think. She'll have to deliver a dead baby tomorrow and I give zero fucks. 

That shocks me because I'm actually a mother and I couldn't even fathom losing my own son. 

I feel like maybe I should feel a little remorse for her since we are technically friends

I guess it's just that I know her too well and that she's not ready to be a parent. She's barely 20, ridiculously childish, drinks like a fish (while pregnant) and actually to be quite blunt: she's a massive whore. I don't mean that in a cunty ""chick on chick"" rant kind of way; she's actually a whore. For example, which while still in a relationship with the jerk off that impregnated her, she introduced herself to an additional 5 dicks in a 3 day period because ""he wouldn't answer his phone"". Then bragged about it. 

Her boyfriend is the same way. He's one of the few people I know with herpes from his own outside flings. Now they both have it and they're ""so in love"".

I just feel like maybe I should feel some sort of sadness for her since I was once in her pregnant state. I feel like maybe it's part of human nature but honestly

I never told my mum the truth about my grades etc (eventho I was never less than a B student), waiting for her to get home, get the scream-treatment and get it over it. Just to then repeat next month. This went on all trough high school too.

My mum is not a ""bitch"" or anything. To be honest she's cool and loves me a lot. But I always felt like telling her the truth would disappoint her so much I beter make some make-believe to make her proud of me. It wasnt just the grades and homework either.

That brings me to my current situation. I was a ""I'm genius, some years after I'd have a lot more work to do.) Obviously I never told my mum about any of this.

I have a steady and decent paying job and work 40+ hours a week. I browse Reddit for about 35 of those. She works from home about 3-4 hours a day. We live together and have for a while. I pay for most things since I make far more than she does.

A few years back I did some traveling and I loved every second of it. Every day since I’ve been back I think about going back or traveling somewhere new. The people I met

I’m really stuck. Both things make me happy. I love both very much but I fear that they won’t ever merge into awesomeness. Living overseas is a dream I’ve had for a very long time.

I’m also bitter about my job. Browsing the net and Reddit most of the day sounds awesome but really

There are tons of other confessions but we’ll start with this…feel better about it a bit already.

I feel that it was my fault because I drank way more than I should have

Now, and have been made fun of for it, which makes me feel like a prude and even more worthless.

Fast forward to university, and stopped. Now, anytime we get close to having sex, and then stop, I attribute it to me not being good enough. I've only ever told 3 people about the rape, and one of them I only told that I wasn't a virgin.

1327885664.0,p2by7,It's my fault.,konvers8,15,2,6,"Hi there reddit. I just need to get this off my chest.

A few days ago, put her husband through architect school, and saw her youngest daughter emigrate to the US and live there. When I was six months old, my grandmother came over from Ukraine to help out my mother. She took care of me while my mom was out working and teaching and while my dad wasn't home. My dad died when I was one, and my grandmother stayed in the US to help take care of me when my grieving mother was struggling to stay afloat.

My mom remarried, I remember more. I always got permission from her to go out and play, she was the one who tucked me in at night and who fixed me up when I got hurt--never my mother. I remember her frustrations at learning English, and I coached her for her citizenship exam, which she took and passed with pride with my help.

My mom got a divorce and moved out, and I moved with her to a small house and virtually no income. My grandmother gave us her pension, her foodstamps, what she had saved from baby-sitting, to help keep us afloat. My little brother was stuck in a custody battle and I  was starting my freshman year of highschool. She was at home every day, with a smile for me and genuine curiosity about how my day had been. It seemed like she did everything around the house, laundry, even yard work--and no matter how many times I offered to help

My mom remarried. I now had a second step-father and he seemed as volatile as my mother. They argued constantly, and his second oldest son hated him and constantly ran away.

My mother began to argue with my grandmother too, and I never forgave my mother for doing it.

As I got older, by the unpredictability of my parents. We were both at their mercy--we had no money, and relied on them, and we were subject to their every whim. She stood up for me and I stood up for more. I remember my parents talking about sending her off to a retirement home, or getting an apartment for her so she wouldn't ""interfere"" with their ""parenting."" My mother begrudged her the very food she ate to the point of my grandmother refusing to leave her room for days because of the threat to her, and refusing to eat.

Things calmed down as I got older

One year, 911 was called, and we broke down the bathroom door and carried my grandmother onto her bed. I held her and talked to her, and when the EMT's showed up, I was the one that rode in the ambulance, tried to keep her awake, translated for her. I was the one who stayed with her in the Intensive Care Unit while my mother bawled her eyes out somewhere else. I was the one that read to her and stayed with her alone for hours in the hospital while my mother cowered somewhere else. I was the one who held her hand while her grip got weaker and weaker, I'll admit now

Where was my mother? Where was the daughter of the dying woman? Somewhere else. Crying her eyes out.

My grandmother died several days later in July. There was a funeral no-one came to, unforgiving clay far away from the place she was born.

It's been a while, and she was probably knocked unconscious.

When she woke up, nobody woke up in time. I don't know how long she was laying there--alone, scared, half-paralyzed.

And the worst thing was that she wasn't calling her daughter's name

This was the woman I loved the most in this world, calling my name for help, and I just couldn't wake up. I couldn't fucking wake up and help the one person I loved on this earth.

I'm pretty damn sure I'm responsible for the prolonged suffering and eventual death of the one person I cared about on this earth.**",,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/p2by7/its_my_fault/

Months went by, sleep, not to anything, and she would just stroke my hair and play games right next to me. It was like my own personal paradise. She had no idea how I felt, until the night I finally told her.

When I did, in my dorm. My roommate had just moved out cuz he got his girlfriend pregnant. So, instead of having someone else in my room, I had an empty bed. I told her she could stay the night (we had just gotten back in from hanging out with a bunch of people). As we lay there, next to each other, my iPod was playing all the sappy lovey dovey songs and right then, in the right moment

It was amazing. Her lips were cold, mine were a little rough and chapped. It was like the perfect match. When we finally pulled back, she apologized, but I told her it was something I'd wanted for a long time. Over Thanksgiving, she stops talking to me suddenly. I get so torn up about it, I end up with my ex for a little while. Back from Christmas break, she invites me over to have some wine. That was the night I learned I hated wine (too bitter for me

She apologized for cutting me out, mainly because I was tired of waiting for her to realize how much she meant to me. Then, all of the sudden, everything gets really serious. She tells me she's fallen for me, she's wanted me for so long, and as an added bonus, for my birthday

A month later, and had come to me to tell me she wanted me to be in her life in the way we had both wanted for oh so long. Too late. We have remained friends to this day, but she'll never know this.

I love her. I've loved her for a really long time. If she ever wanted me, but if the girl I loved came for me and told me of how it could/would be if we were together, I know it would be very very very VERY hard for me to turn her away.

I ask Amy out and she says yes. We go out a couple of times but nothing comes of it. A couple of months later we run into each other and get talking.

Lets call this guy she's with Mike. Now

We go out again for maybe two months but I've a lot of shit going on at home and I can't manage to be in a relationship. I can't give her the time she deserves and we just grow apart.

They're pretty good friends and we start hanging around in the same social group for a month or two. I become infatuated again. My friend finds out she's interested in me. I ask her out yet again

A couple of months into what seems to be a promsing relationship and she becomes close to Mike again. I get upset. I get really fucking upset. What's Mike doing that I'm not? I start thinking about how she picked him over me. I confront her. She explains to me she use to cut herself back while she was with Mike. She told Mike at the time. He started cutting. She blames herself for Mike starting to cut. She tells me they mostly just text checking on one another. 

A year and three months since we start going out and the relationship is going wonderfully. We have our ups and downs but generally everything's perfect. I adore the girl.

So now we're on today. Amy was doing some collecting for charity and she asks a friend (Susan lets say). Susan asks Mike to give her a hand but has to cancel at the last minute.

Okay. So there was this post in r/sex about thinking of murdering when having an orgasm. I thought 'in b4 serial killer get therapey!111'. I have had violent fantasies for much of my life

Anyway, but what about the future?

I am doing a PhD in physiology, here is my little story.

When I was really young, I just stuffed them all in a jar, practically full, closed the lid and left them there. I don't remember why. But the next day, I opened the jar to find a smelly mess of dying caterpillars. This was my first memory of feeling guilty. It was horrible. No more hurting little bugs because they want to live too. I will help them live. So I made little gardens for bugs, and put all this sugar for ants to swarm. I would rescue spiders from people who wanted to kill them. But one day, I had this urge to squash a spider. I did it and it felt really good. It was unusually good. But then I felt bad for feeling good. It was strange. I called it the 'evil emotion'.

Later, like animals had some drive to live. I tried to help the small animals, but later on, I looked forward to my cat catching animals, in a way. These animals never let me touch them normally, but if my cat caught them, I could. I tried to catch birds myself. I liked how they were scared of me, other than just hold them for a bit, where she would grab onto when trying to escape

So that's just a few early experiences with animals. Later on, I would think of a story to daydream in my mind. They all pretty much had some element of violence in them. I was trying to induce 'evil emotion'. They'd just be things like being a vampire and hunting down people (or werewolf, or something like that) or some kind of giant like Godzilla, destroying the city, or leading an alien invasion. Funnily enough, I grew up Catholic. I had this ritual of saying one 'Our Father' prayer and make the sign of the cross before I was allowed to think of any of this stuff. It's like it made it okay. I don't know how or why I thought this, but making the sign of the cross was like logging on and off from God's mind. I logged on to pray, God could listen if he wanted, found in kids shows. Or educational stuff

When I was getting to puberty, I read it over and over again, and it was simply a paragraph about how aztecs would do human sacrifice by cutting out beating hearts. And I also watched an Indianna Jones movie where a beating heart was ripped out. I was obsessed about ripping out hearts. I even found a story I wrote in grade 6 about it, but it looks like the teacher never corrected it. I still wonder what would have happened if she had seen it.

As I got older

I had a boyfriend when I was 17, trying to impress classmates who couldn't stand me. Anyway, all we would do is make out and it was so boring. I only felt arousal a few times. When kissing him at the school ball, and someone thought it was disgusting. And when I was lying on top of him, it felt like I holding him down. I wanted to hurt him. I had these dreams where I dismembered him, and thought 'shit, better break up'. I didn't feel anything towards him, and I learned that if I did it, and they asked what I thought about when I masturbate. I knew I couldn't say 'wrapping my legs around someone

I'm in my late 20s and just started having sexual relations. They are just casual and I have to think of this crap to have an orgasm with a partner. At least the fantasies are kind of impossible to act out

But one of my fantasies with a partner is to put them to sleep and hold them while listening and feeling changes in breathing and heart rate. But I just get my partner to lie there while I do this

Up to here, and I did behavioural tests in rats. At the end, we perfused the rats to harvest the brain. Part of it involved grabbing the beating heart and sticking a needle in. It did not feel good at all and I was relieved. I felt horrible, and was worried the rat wasn't properly anesthetized. So, I went on to do more animal work.

But sure enough, and tried to make them as comfortable as possible. We killed rats by injecting sodium phenobarbital. They'd simply fall asleep and die. I began to like holding them and nuzzling against them as they fell asleep. I would hold them until they stopped breathing. I would dissect some. Must make full use of exploited animals.

This thing seems to be some kind of defense mechanism. I find something disturbing at first, and I was taught how to do cervical dislocation. So now I would put mice to sleep with gas anesthetic, and break their necks. This feels so good. Recently, I have been putting them under, and breaking necks as soon as they start waking up, so I can feel them struggle a bit. The next 'escalation' will be to do it fully awake. I don't want to do that. Cervical dislocation is a humane method of euthanasia, but I do it under anesthetic so the mouse is completely still and there is no chance of mucking it up. Awake it fine too

Look, is the capability there? I do have a reasoning mind, which says nobody's (no animal's – except maybe insects) pain is worth my pleasure. When I hear about lust and thrill murders, or anything like that, I think 'in what mind do you think killing somebody is worth a bit of pleasure. Doesn't anything else feel good, or what?' Because that's the thing, making animals feel good works just as well

I used to avoid any sort of movie, I didn't actually cause it, so just why not? Oh its animals eating each other, totally natural, predators need to eat'. But yeah, now I'm killing animals for a job. I could do whatever to mice without anyone knowing before I kill them. This is the scary part. Once I taped a mouse's tail to its cage and poked at it and it became angry at me, which was the point. That's probably the worst I have done. I don't want to like it

Is anybody else like me? Is this common? As the Dahmer interview said

*TL;DR Have various violent fantasies and have started to enjoy restraining and killing small animals. I also have violent sexual fantasies and need them to orgasm. But it only feels good if I also think of how bad and wrong it is.*

The thing is I'm married.  I have a kid and another on the way.  I really do care for my wife, sometimes when I'm home - even though she disapproves and it hurts her way too much for it to be ok.

We could get better, takes much better care of herself, and is just different.  I'm tempted to continue flirting just to see where it goes, but I have a family.  I know what damage I could cause by cheating to both my wife and my kids, but part of me doesn't care - which sickens the other part of me.

Since then, the part that no one should ever speak of. Sometimes I'd even make stuff up about myself. I became helpless in their eyes. Nobody would truly know who I really was.

Well, In school I had little to no friends and would basically follow all the kids around only to get made fun of. Since elementary school I was bullied by most kids and rarely had friends. The “friends” I had always either called me gay, ugly, or just made fun of me in general. I had also developed a bad habit of stealing. I would steal whatever I wanted which would mostly be Yu-Gi-Oh cards from other students or stores such as walmart. I would always feel really guilty afterwards but I was really interested in them but I was too afraid to ask my parents because they wouldn’t let me buy things which would distract me from school. Which I admit was really brattish of me. Don’t get me wrong though, my parents weren’t terrible. My mom did beat me and they were very sheltering and close-minded but they worked really hard to do good for my sister and I. There was constant arguing between my parents in the house and there were RARELY times where we acted like a family. I’ve seen my dad slap my mom and they were always going back and forth with yelling, throwing and arguing. Everytime I would see or hear this I would be extremely depressed and was worried they’d get a divorce. 

Moving on too middle school, like how I just got playstation or how my dad sells cars to celebrities. I’d go to extremeties to prove my lies to be correct by taking pictures of fake receipts to show my friends and what not. I basically quit stealing but developed a bad and serious habit of lying. My grades also severely slipped as I started acting like the class clown in attempt to make more friends. 

High school is where all the serious problems started. I had moved to Canada from America and the crowd was much tougher. I started losing interest in school, I started telling her stories about how I know all these girls and one of them likes me in attempt to make her jealous. I even went as far as to making a fake msn account and talking to her through it to make my stories seem real. I’d use this account and talk to her and tell her “secrets” about me that only this imaginary person knew. 

It grew worse and then I started telling her lies about how I’m in a gang, hook up with so many girls when in reality I was always sitting at home staring at my computer screen. At home, my parents started hating me for failing school so I made up a lie that I was approached by a major record label and they wanted to sign me. So I was telling all these people a billion lies just to get them to accept me. I went on to tell this girl that I’m a year older than I actually am since she was older than me and only liked guys her age. I made MORE fake accounts and talked to her through all of them to tell her crazy stories about me and what I do.  She eventually started liking me. To seal the deal, I lied to my parents about how I needed money to pay fees for a music attorney to get enough money to take her to a fancy dinner. We started going out and I continued lying to her as she kept asking me stories about my past. I told her how my dad went to jail, his family sells drugs, I was constantly abused as a child and how my parents hate me. In the meanwhile, I also kept taking money from my parents to take her on dates by giving wild excuses about how my music career was sprouting.

Moving on to current day, she doesn’t know anything. Our relationship is built on lies and same goes for my parents. I’m probably the biggest dirt bag in the world because I stole money and about $1,500 worth of gold from my mom to use on my girlfriend. I’ve also been telling my girlfriend how I just got $100,000 by signing a big record deal. I told her this because there was a time in between where I had no job, dropped out of high school and I wanted to give her a reason to be with me.  I still have fake accounts I use to talk to my girlfriend which are mainly ""friends"" who help give her relationship advice (Basically they tell her all the shit i wish i could say but i'm too scared too and too find out what she thinks of me). So i pretty much have a huge network of fake ""friends"" aside from the couple ones that actually exist.

I continually tell my parents lies to keep them happy and same with my girlfriend. I’m completely dead inside at this point

I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life, but I’m tired now. I know I'm crazy but I don’t want to do this anymore. The only problem is I also don't want to lose my girlfriend as she’s the closest thing I’ve ever had to a best friend/lover. I can’t tell my parents because they’ll hate me. All i want to do is tell them everything, give them hugs, kisses and say how much they mean to me but in real life I know they'd leave.

I am having to help her financially because if not she would have to move away to move in with her family or my son would effectively live in poverty when with her. I have enough money for this but know she will depend on my help but she is adamant she does not need my help but is accepting of it anyway. She refuses to acknowledge that finances will be a problem without my help but seriously, we are very financially viable


Secondly my mum is battling 2 types of cancer and has been undergoing chemotherapy on and off for some months. My ex-partner is simply not interested and has never thought of this as something which will affect me as I rarely show my feelings but for god sake this must affect anyone to some degree. We are not openly affectionate as a family and I don't know if this makes it worse or better. I had a lot of difficulties with my mum when growing up including a kind of abuse but have moved past that as far as I can even though I will never forget it.


My dad is an alcoholic and effectively leaves me and my sister to run our struggling family businesses. I have my own business also and we have had to turn his companies upside-down to keep them viable and successful. They were run in such an old fashioned way but to him in his drunken haze


I feel numb most of the time and show little to nothing. This is not because I don't want to but it really does feel like I will lose it if I let it out.

It was not long before we packed up our stuff after a closing shift for a very spontaneous road trip to go get drunk together with a friend of hers a state over. Hell, for some reason

She talks about her fiancée a lot and I know he travels for business most of the time, surprises, or when she tries to be sexy for him, he is very insecure, and he is extremely paranoid that she will cheat on him (note that he does not know that I do tons of things with her that he cannot due to his job, let alone that I even exist). So, during random talks, and she doesn't mind.

A few weeks ago, but I dropped it when I found out she was engaged (only half true). She wasn't creeped out and thanked me for telling her. Since then, she has been talking to me even more and even called me before her fiancée about a pregnancy scare she had just a few weeks ago. Just yesterday, She called me to see if I wanted to hang out. Little did I know, yesterday ""hanging out"" meant me showing up at her house alone to talk with her while she tanned in what her fiancée apparently says is the skimpiest bikini she owns. He doesn't like her wearing it in public because he doesn't like other men gawking at his gorgeous fiancée. She is even mad that he won't drape her around his arm and walk with her like the trophy wife she is (going to be at least).

At this point, and that I would better appreciate her. I feel like I deserve her more than the man she plans on marrying. I would do anything/everything to/for her.

To begin with, namely getting married and having children at a young age. As such, she often despised my boyfriends and claimed they were a bad influence. In reality, they were really trying to help me become independent from her, and I think she knew that. 

However, and my sisters both married and had children and did not complete their education. They express regret for this, but they all claimed they did so to get away from my mother who is, again, extremely controlling. Truthfully, I don't much blame them, and I recently moved in with my boyfriend to get out from under so that I could live more independently (to her rage and consternation). 

BUT what I'm really trying to say is this. I've been pressured my entire life to make up for the mistakes of my siblings and be, she verbally tears me apart for it. That, and I'm terrified of disappointing her. She's faced so much disappointment and heartache in her life, and I want to be the one to make her proud. 

I'm in school currently studying for a double major in Criminal Justice and Political Science, and I know she wont be happy if I postpone my education.

Truthfully, and despite her faults, she's still my mother and I do love her. But I also want to live my own life on my own terms but I don't know what the right decision is.

And finally, and I'm not even sure she realizes how much it stresses me out. I really just want to do something that makes me happy, but I don't know...I don't think me being happy will be good enough for her, because half the time, anything I do is never good enough.

That is fine and that is trite and cliche.

The problem is what happens after.  When I am writing I am focused I am there.  You could break a 2x4 over my head but I'd keep writing.  After it is like...the world is wrong.  Something is just out of place.  I fight with it for awhile and try to press on and then I snap.

I drink or engage in some other form of binge...sex or drugs or whatever.  I become incredibly vicious toward those I care about.  I unroll this outrageous list of shit and throw it on them.  Somewhere in my head is this camera recording every slight and every betrayal and then it comes out.

I have lost friends.  I have lost lovers.  I have destroyed relationships with family.

Everyone thinks I'm a *nice guy* because they never hear or don't believe.

I tried not writing for awhile but I felt useless.  I tried writing without going to that place and what I produced was terrible.  I hoped

All I want is to do what I love to do and every time I do...I pay and make other people chip in.  I tried to explain these things to people.  Tried to tell them how I see the world and how I function in that world but as I've aged I have realized that I cannot make them see it.  I can either write and be alone or be with people and not write and be fucking miserable.

Anyway we went at it.  He took an end, once you've seen that another man's junk is significantly smaller than yours it's hard to respect him.

At one point she said, it was odd and fun and just odd.  My buddy was holding her arms, and fucking her mouth intermittently, slapping her tits... mostly he was just focused on chanting, ""Fuck that slut, fuck her!  Fuck her whore pussy!"" while I was balls deep in her.  He got all animalistic with his voice, was kinda creepy.

When I was ready he said, ""Swallow it whore!""  Then we switched sides, had he on her back on an ottoman, and he told me, to ""throat fuck her,"" while he fucked her in the ass.  ""Slap her tits, harder... she really likes it.""  When he was ready he busted on her stomach.

No swords ever crossed and I went back to my hotel room after, and he took a job (at my company) where he would be required to travel a lot more.  The only time he mentions her is to say how pissed off he is that she got so fat, or to complain that she's going to make their daughter grow up fat, and to warn people to say off the Eastern European women, ""They just don't age well.""

It is still very awkward. It's also a real bummer because a lot of friends that I was close to before I introduced her don't really talk to me anymore. I miss those friends a lot; I know it will never be the same with them again.

I also feel like I am being judged due to stories that my ex may have told about petty complaints she may have had when we were together

I do not like making a scene, she would make it known that she was not happy. Her issues with me were not usually a big deal, they were normally small things, like going to a workout class she taught, just work schedules got in the way.

Also, I just don't toot my own horn when I do something right, or make my actions that I do for other people this big public ordeal.

My best friend (I'll call him Sam) and I have had a very long, and I was really immature and superficial and broke up with him multiple times for stupid reasons, including that his sense of humor annoyed me and I hated the way he dressed. But I had self esteem problems and dealt with being rejected by a lot of other guys I liked, so I kept going back out with him when he initiated stuff. 

We were each others' ""first"" everything. But when I got to college, I'm a horrible person for the way I treated Sam, and I regret it all the time. But after not speaking to each other for several years, out of the blue he sent me a message saying he missed how close we were in high school, before we dated, and he wanted to be friends again. I agreed in part because I was still dating Tony, and regretted it all. Tony was abusive, to support me until I was ready to leave Tony, and there have been issues of jealousy that have come up on both sides.

At this point though, acting like he's smarter and more mature than me because he's older and has done it all, seen it all, and accuses me of having anger problems. I have a temper, yes, and I don't control it with him like I should because I let my guard down too much, because we are so close. But when I feel like I have a legitimate reason to be mad at him, or other subtle abuse, because he is my closest friend

I want to ""break up with him"" as a friend for good, maybe I'm paranoid about the gaslighting because of the abuse I dealt with from Tony, and I'm the one really at wrong here, just like back in college. I don't make friends well, I'm very introverted and afraid that if I alienate him and our mutual friends side with him, I'll be virtually alone. ",,,,

I saw a lot of my classmates who didn't get into the societies be negatively affected by it.  They started seeing themselves as subtly inferior.  This manifested itself in their choice of career path, as well as just generally thinking of themselves as less than first-rate.  I was determined not to let myself be hurt in that way, and perhaps for that reason, I cannot seem to let go of my outrage at being rejected (over 10 years ago at this point).  Just yesterday, I had an episode of internalized rage.

This has also hurt my relationship with my family.  My father, among other things, that he sent me to an inferior public school system, even though he could have afforded the finest prep school, his fear being that I would self-identify as a member of the elite, and not one of the masses, if I went to a private school.  I was at least able to convince him to send my little brother to a private boarding school.  Now, with his preppy pedigree

I realize many of you will think I am an elitist caricature, I wish I could meet a fellow alum without being afraid of being asked whether I was in one of the societies.

It started when I was browsing the internet and my thoughts started tugging me towards looking at porn. It starts and even if you don't plan on anything happening you'll convince yourself and you go through your tribal routine, but I have a fetish for facials. Namely, giving them out. So after browsing the normal spots and realizing nothing new was there, I decided to google for tumblrs of amateurs enjoying my fantasy out.

I found what seems to me to be a fairly legitimate website, so I clicked on it to see where it would lead me. That was stupid in the first place, but it took me to a website that looked like a redtube with plenty of video links splayed out. I saw one that looked good with a hot brunette and I clicked it, and my day was instantly ruined.

I saw about .2 seconds of the page after it loaded

After taking a minute to breathe I put things in a little context. I'm honestly so naive with computers I was worried about the feds getting my ISP at first. Then I took a minute to think and realized I didn't really intend to go there, I've never been to such a dark place before but I tried to put it behind me. 

This little incident brought up a flood of dark guilt from my past

The reason I think this incident sparked such a visceral response for me is simple. When I was younger I had homosexual encounters with a neighbor. It's not really as simple as that, y'know how kids are curious and don't really have a concept of sexuality. We were the same age, around the time you can first get an erection, and we would literally swordfight and it just progressed to having anal sex and other things and it was all so natural at the time. We thought we were playing, but it would haunt us both for years to come.

What vexes me though is that we knew it was wrong. It's not like we did it in the open, he lives in New York and I'm still in Texas but he comes to our hometown and we keep in touch. That is my first confession, that my first sexual encounter was with another guy and it has been a dark horse riding along in the back of my mind for my entire life so far. I'm sorry Jack.

Second confession is more broad, she had never done anything before. She was in love with me and I knew how to exploit her, I hated love and she thought she could save me. By the end she was a broken heart who was reduced to begging for me. She hated swallowing and sometimes she would fight but I would shove her head into my cock until she gagged. Then I would dump her ten seconds later and walk out while she was crying. I all but about destroyed that girl. Thank god she's happy and well adjusted, we've actually seen each other a few times and I feel that we've indirectly reconciled to be friends. I'm sorry Kate.

There were a string of girls that meant nothing in college. Sometimes I would make rounds fucking them and trying them to do embarassing, how far could the envelope be pushed in one night. I have some great stories, but it was so sociopathic I'm actually ashamed. I'm sorry Sammie, I'm sorry Allie. To the rest, no apology because I think you enjoyed it as much as I did.

I've repressed these things for quite some time, so I'm hoping by writing this out I can let it slowly wash out and become a new man, or even just a better one. I don't want to say sorry to this one.

Other than that, now I'm going to fall asleep and hope I wake up very refreshed.


tl;dr

I had an abnormal sexual experience at a young age that has influenced every stage of my psycho-social-sexual development and those feelings resurfaced today in a strong way. I'm here to confess.

I'm not sure whether it was the divorce that made me question the world I was brought up in or the sudden maelstrom of hormones in my 15 year old body but I woke up to the world in the summer of that year. Since then I began rebelling against the church and hating my parents like many would have in my position. Except I was the only one. The black sheep in my family and my church.

My Dad slowly dwindled from my life and I have allowed my self to sever that particular wound but my mom is a different issue. She was the one parent who I knew had my back when I had an issue with my estranged father, I blamed her for. If she loved me she should have respected my decision to not believe instead of forcing me to listen to old men telling me how to avoid the unavoidable human nature that they call ""sin"". That is what triggered the hate, I think.

There is nothing more pathetic in my mind than the hypocrite that was my mother. A middle aged woman of 250lbs should not be complaining about her weight when there is an unused treadmill set up in the next room for her. A divorcee clinging to book which condemns divorced women is the most pathetic of her hypocrisies. She never leaves home. She does nothing but play her stupid little game on her computer day in and day out.

At this point being around her depresses me. She is alone and depressed and wont talk about any other aspect of herself. I have my own emotional issues (which i attribute greatly to her and my dad) without having to feel like the life is sucked out of me every time she's in town. What's worse is that if I don't let myself swallow my anger and pity and spend some time with her when I can,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,t3_1ipwb6

What I feel like I wasted my time in college is I wish I was more active and social sooner instead of after I lost the weight during the last semester of college. I use to feel like everyone placed judgement on me, or my religion. And because of my view of people, I shut myself in my apartment the whole time I was in college without making many friends, without joining clubs. I just sat at my apartment playing games on my computer being miserable for no reason at all. 

right now, I am suffering from a language barrier whenever I meet someone who doesn't know english. It becomes even more awkward when I cant talk to people that remember me when I was younger and end up ending the conversation as though I never meet them before. This could have been prevented if I wasnt so afraid of people and just had the courage to engage in a conversation. instead I ended up handicapping myself by losing a large portion of arabic during my time in the United States.

We had been going through a rough patch and I thought things were getting better. She seemed to be happier. Turns out she was happier because she was about to move on...

I can't help but feel like it is all my fault. Like I wasn't good enough for her. I know I'm being stupid and she and I weren't a good match and she was probably slightly emotionally abusive. She was constantly calling me fat and saying I needed to lose weight. She didn't like the fact that at 25 I was taking some time to figure out things because I'm still getting over my mom's death (about a year and 3/4 ago) instead of doing what I went to school for (teach). She even went so far as to say that my dad had a shitty job and he should have been ashamed of it (he was a store manager in retail).

I tell everyone how bad she was and how shitty she treated me but in my head I keep thinking how amazing it would be if she called me and asked to talk because she missed me and we patched it up. It is to the point that I think I'm worthless and the depression I thought I had gotten over is catching up to me. I broke down a week or so when I was changing a tire and couldn't loosen the bolts. Just sort of... gave up threw it all down and walked inside. Feelings I thought I'd dealt with involving the death of my mom are starting to show up again.
