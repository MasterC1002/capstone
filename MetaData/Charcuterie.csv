I grabbed the package from the freezer

While applying the cure, but no big deal, it'll just be a bit on the lean side.

Throughout the week I checked on my curing meat and kept thinking ""this sure isn't behaving like my past bacons""

Come the following weekend I smoke it and slice it.

Drat! This bacon isn't just a little lean

It still tastes good, I froze the bacon with the thought that I would just use it for cooking in other dishes.

A couple of days pass

Hey, didnt I just cure that?  And wait, didn't I have a beef brisket that I hadn't smoked yet?

[**Meat Smoking And Smokehouse Design** Stanley Marianski


[**The Art of Making Fermented Sausages** Stanley Marianski
The majority of books written on making sausages do not tackle the subject of fermented sausages at all. The topic is limited to a statement that this is an advanced field of sausage making which is not recommended for an amateur sausage maker. Well, if he only knew how. Highly technical papers were published in Food Technology journals which unfortunately were written in very difficult terms. Thus the idea of bridging the technology gap that existed between Meat Science and the requirements of the typical hobbyist was born. With more information obtainable every day, and commercial starter cultures available to the public, there is little reason to abstain from making quality salamis at home, regardless of the climate and outside conditions.


**[Nose To Tail by Fergus Henderson](http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Beast-Nose-Tail-Eating/dp/0060585366/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329202504&amp;sr=8-1)** The Whole Beast: Nose to Tail Eating is a certified ""foodie"" classic. In it, is a world-renowned destination for people who love to eat ""on the wild side"" -- presents the recipes that have marked him out as one of the most innovative, yet traditional, chefs. Here are recipes that hark back to a strong rural tradition of delicious thrift, and that literally represent Henderson's motto, ""Nose to Tail Eating"" -- be they Pig's Trotter Stuffed with Potato, Rabbit Wrapped in Fennel and Bacon

[**The Alchemist's Book of Salami and Other Fermented Sausages by William R. Mende**](http://www.thealchemist.us/alchemist1_007.htm) Included are chapters devoted to meat, pathogens and their control, cultures and their use, as well as formulas for Cervelat, Salsiccia Spalmabile, Longaniza, Lebanon Bologna, Chorizo, Soppressata

This book uses ""industrial methods"" applicable to the hobbyist. Learn how to make your own fermented sausage.)

Moderator Hamsterdam has given me her blessing to post this thread so big thanks to her.

We are a fairly new subreddit focusing on

I know a lot of you that come here make your own cured meats, as a matter of fact I have been a subscriber here for a month or so and currently have a pork belly curing in the fridge. Why not show off what you've made and what you do with what you've made over at /r/fromscratch? I think charcuterie is a great albeit rapidly disappearing art. The more people we can get interested the better!

So what qualifies as ""from scratch?""

Make your own bread? Share it!

Made a sauce or soup? Let us check it out!

Obviously any kind of charcuterie

Anything that's made from scratch we want to see!

Also

Well

One more big thanks to Hamsterdam and the great community here!

I want to start off with something easy


---

I found what I believe to be a good recipe

One 5-pound slab pork belly
For the dry cure
4 garlic cloves
2 teaspoons pink salt (see Note)
1/4 cup Morton’s kosher salt
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons juniper berries
4 bay leaves
1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
4 or 5 sprigs fresh thyme
4 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper
DIRECTIONS
1. Trim the belly so that its edges are neat and square.
2. Combine the garlic, dark brown sugar, juniper berries, bay leaves, nutmeg, thyme, and half the black pepper in a bowl and mix thoroughly so that the pink salt is evenly distributed. Rub the mixture all over the belly to give it a uniform coating over the entire surface.
3. Place the belly in a 2-gallon Ziploc bag or in a covered nonreactive container just large enough to hold it. Refrigerate for 7 days. Without removing the belly from the bag
4. After 7 days, refrigerate it on the cure for 1 to 2 more days.
5. Remove the belly from the bag or container, roll up the pork belly tightly, as you would a thick towel, and tie it very tightly with butcher’s string at 1- to 2-inch intervals. It’s important that there are no air pockets inside the roll. In other words, it can’t be too tightly rolled. Alternately, the pancetta can be left flat, wrapped in cheesecloth
6. Using the string to suspend it, but a cool, humid basement works fine, as will most any place that’s out of the sun. (I often hang mine in our kitchen next to the hanging pans on either side of the stove.) Humidity is important: If your pancetta begins to get hard, it’s drying out and should be wrapped and refrigerated. The pancetta should be firm but pliable, not hard. Because pancetta isn’t meant to be eaten raw, the drying isn’t as critical a stage as it is for items such as prosciutto or dry-cured sausages. But drying pancetta enhances its texture, and helps it to last longer.
7. After drying

*(Any other suggestions?)*



**Meat:**
And of course



Now a few questions: To hang dry sausage it seems like I don't actually *need* a full length fridge (I'm interested in fairly short sausage not the longer styles) or could I make do with a mini fridge?

1370623115.0,1fvcui,Sea Salt Only Bacon,mtkd,11,4,2,"There has been a couple of posts about pink salt lately.

I started making bacon a couple of years ago. With only sea salt.

1) Take a full pork belly with bones in

2) Bone it myself using a filleting knife to ensure there are no holes or flaps in the belly for moisture to trap

3) Rub course sea salt all over the belly

4) Place in a large stainless steel bowl - folding the belly in half (I have seen people cut it in to two instead and stack them)

5) Fill gently with enough filtered water to just cover the belly and tip some extra salt in to the water

6) Cover with upside-down plates to keep the belly submerged

7) Fridge it for 3 - 4 days (5 days gets a bit too salty)

8) Take out

9) Store skin side down in your separate cured meat fridge on a baking rack

This is ready too cook immediately

I've got a 7 month old end piece in my meat fridge which is too hard to cut with a knife now but hasn't spoiled at all.

The only issue I've had has been leaving a flap and moisture getting in - but could smell immediately the problem and it cut out fine.

This is after a couple of days - you can see where it has stretched a little on the left from being hung:

1337447731.0,tuvy5,Confused on home cured bacon! Would appreciate some help!,transt,5,1,6,"Hello

So last week we did our first attempt at home cured bacon and smoked it ( http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/tdt9o/smoked_bacon_for_the_first_time_today_what_do_you/ ) and it turned out very well.

I am confused now though because we want to try a maple cured bacon recipe

http://stephhicks68.hubpages.com/hub/maple-cured-bacon

that was very similar to other recipes that I saw. The confusing part is that they don't actually smoke or cook the bacon in the oven before frying.

When we did the first batch, and brown sugar. We then smoked one as shown above, and did the other in the oven similar as described here:

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/dining/the-art-of-making-your-own-bacon.html

(oven cooked). We then fried it to crispy before eating.

So my question is:

Will the bacon be safe to eat with just curing and then frying in a pan? Why does the NYtimes recipe (which was very similar to a bunch of other ones online)

None of the recipes use ""pink salt""

Thank you!

I've been searching the interwebs for fresh ham recipes. I see a lot of them are really recipes for pre-baked store-bought pre-smoked hams.  That's not what I'm doing.

[I've found this recipe](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2012/12/roasted-fresh-ham-with-citrus-and-rye) which I was planning on giving a go.  However, and then baking.  I'm not sure if it should be dry cure (because the recipe doesn't say that, but it doesn't say add water either).  And, if so, if that's okay.

Also, this doesn't seem necessary (I'm trying to fill in the blanks for my self here).  Do I understand something incorrectly.

I can cook many many things without recipes.  I'm pretty handy in the kitchen.  So I really want to make sure I understand what's going on so I can do it right.

It seems that the recipe calls for baking right after dry curing.  No soaking.  No smoking.  Sound right?

Can anyone help fill in the details for me? ",self,t5_2t1u1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/150v3d/fresh_ham_uncured_unsmoked_questions/
