This act is original purpose was to identify individuals who are/will be responsible for publishing any defamatory or anarchistic material or anything of its likes.


However


This act does not take into account of factors of identity thefts and computer hacking. The offense will also be weighed on the owner of the page/site even if the comments/posts is published by other people.


This greatly affects us

How can you help with the Stop 114a movement even if you're not from Malaysia?


The very least I can ask from you would be to post on Twitter with the hashtag #stop114a or post on any social network regarding the flawed Act 114a and it's withdrawal.


TL;DR New act in Malaysia which states that you are responsible for any defamatory posts on your site/page even if not your own.

Timeline:

1. RH Bill is introduced due to overpopulation and high crime rate
2. Religious sectors against it. Calling it abortion. Condoms and contraception is abortion.
3. Senator Sotto writes/copies melodramatic biased speech against the bill. He a powerful voice of the Religious sector.
4. People call him out for plagiarism and melodrama.
5. He denies
6. In his embarrassment
7. The Law passes
8. Alleged PNP Facebook account uses new law to threaten people for criticizing them

Here's the link to the threat:

http://www.rappler.com/nation/13410-pnp-warns-against-using-foul-word-vs-officers-online

The police are denying that it's their account.

All of this started because we're trying to get the RH Bill passed. A law that will allow people to have access to contraception and birth control. A law that our Roman Catholic

A Senator against the bill plagiarized a blogger when he wrote a speech against the bill. The whole country confronted him for lying online and he cried ""Cyber bullying"" and inserted libel into the Cyber crime law so no one could criticize him anymore. Now the police are abusing the libel clause in the bill.

We are not like you America. We are afraid. We cannot protest the same way you do because you can go to jail here without any formal charges. The police and the government are in control. We are a people who just goes about our lives not really concerned with all the death, we don't care. Well God damnit I DO! I'm sure a lot of people do too!

What can we do? Can you help us spread the word like you did for SOPA

Please, always question authority and think before voting... I don't know what else to say, I don't think I want to live in this country anymore because after 20 years they are still voting a Mafioso, believing all the stupid promises he makes. You'll pay no taxes! Oh that's great, let's just vote him.

The truth is that Berlusconi is a mirror of this country. Italy is a country of thieves and dogs

Everyone knows that Berlusconi won't keep his promises, whose fault is it? Is it our fault, 'cause we didn't react, or is it the government's fault for spreading the plague further?

I cannot describe what has been happening in this country any other way: it's a sickness

Berlusconi entered politics helped by the Mafia while holding a massive media empire and that was just the start of it all... Despite all the shady things he's been doing in all these years, to a public show of whoredom and stupidity. That's Italy, have some ass! Wanna talk about economy? How about some nice piece of ass? Culture? Have some ass! Ass is better than shit like reading or thinking. Have some ass, idiot, and vote for us.

I haven't watched this country's shitty TV in years and now I feel like George Nada in *They Live*, if you question them further they just tilt, you can see the steam come out of their stupid ears while their brain is melting.

Is it really possible to brainwash a country this hard with just TV? I didn't want to believe so

This corrupt government has done everything they could to prevent Internet and international culture from spreading

We are such an ignorant country and ignorance brings corruption, but that won't happen of course.

So how can you fight this? How can a country think it through when it has brain cancer? How can you prevent this sickness from spreading when it's taking over? How can you trust other people when half your country is supporting the Mafia?

At this point I just don't care anymore. I don't have any motivation to stay here,,False,self,t5_2qh9a,False,,True

This isn't even the first thing, and you would be denied the greatest tool mankind has ever created


And that is what is at risk here, exposure of human rights abuses by governments trying to brutally repress their people in Syria, and the list can go on. The unifying response by corrupt governments who want to hide their actions is to censor the people, and block social networking websites.


In the west, or a dictator but the entertainment industry. Are you kidding me? The peddlers of petty distraction, over-hyped rubbish music and film, these are the people taking a small percentage of their profits and using it to bypass democracy, with expensive lobbying throughout the first world? The people who brought you commercialised rap, Justin Bieber, Transformers 3, this is the industry damaging the greatest tool mankind ever created? In the name of their profits for the garbage that they peddle? I can't believe it only it is happening right now


It is a sick joke, one which is frankly irrelevant, and this leads me to my response.


We are the target demographic, Blu rays, cds and so on that funds these companies, and a percentage of that money is put towards damaging our rights to a free and open internet, instead of investment in modern digital distribution models, it is put towards subverting democracy. We stop giving them money.


The Kony 2012 video demonstrated the power of the internet today, this is an idea whose time has come and you and everyone who reads this has the power to fight back. We must be vocal, we must spread this idea, and boycott old media. Their motivations are monetary and we can send a loud message by saying that we will not stand for this and we will hurt them where it matters, in their wallets.


I personally feel sick at the thought of the young man from the UK set to be sent to the US, or when I look forward to seeing The Hobbit, or the new Batman film.
I will not pay to see either of those films, I will not prop up this industry who does not respect the value of the internet or democracy itself. This from an industry whose contribution to humanity is petty distraction for a couple of hours.


This can be hard, discussion forums, youtube, podcasts or new independent artists are all embracing delivering media in a modern open way. Comedian Louis CK saw unprecedented sales of his DRM free, direct downloaded show which I bought a copy of myself. Bypassing the old dinosaur of physical distribution more money went to Louis and the people who made that video and facilitated its distribution digitally, and we the consumer got a better product.


This is an idea whose time has come, and that we can be heard now. We can hit back at their profits, the only thing they care about. We can make this idea spread if you can help.


#boycottoldmedia can trend on twitter, we can share and suggest new entertainment mediums, some of the channels on youtube are very professionally done, share new artists with each other, support new media business models and so on.


This has been heavy on my mind for a long time

**Boycott them

----

Edit: A good point was made in the comments, the entity driving the campaign and questions about it's legitimacy. With the recent controversy, the campaign lost momentum.

This idea is different, of subversion of democracy. This idea is organic on on our collective mind, the large scale protests and responses to ACTA and SOPA show this, the subsequent failure of our politicians to oppose these acts showed the unfortunate reality that the money behind the scenes was still more important.

If we can take the momentum and determination of all the people who opposed those acts, mentioning it to friends and most importantly, not giving these companies your money, you can have a direct and real effect on these companies and affect their prime motivator, profit.

I've watched every single World Cup there's been since as long as I can remember, but I'm sickened by the Brazilian government's response to these protests. Like other major international sporting events, the country hosting the games should be an example to other nations on all fronts. 

As a football fan

Considering the government's behaviour

I know skipping a World Cup, as fans, we shouldn't let sports be tainted by undeserved privileges (which hosting the World Cup is), or by political masquerades (we've seen those before); and as human beings we should fight to protect peaceful protests, wherever they may be taking place.

I doubt Brazilians will be enjoying the World Cup very much after this week's events. I don't see why we should be any different.

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**Syria**

Surprisingly

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination.

We only have elected representatives and our, historically, it was unfeasible and logistically impossible to include everyone in decision-making as a group. As a result, a representative for each population is chosen to vote and speak on their behalf and vote on a consensus. 

So many problems have arisen from this: lobbyists, etc.

Well

Why do we still outsource decision-making to representatives when we can do this ourselves?

**Identifying the creditors and why they have precedence over the future lives of whole nations of people?**

Think clearly about this for a moment.
""austerity"" means your lives will be less free for decades.
Since all nations are ""in debt"" to extreme then their must at it's core be a group of private creditors benefiting from this situation.

governments everyday have the moral right as representatives of the people to weigh and balance private citiziens rights against those of a small minority of other citizens. This happens with other individual citizens property rights being sujugated to community interests in processes such as eminent domain everyday.
It is moral and right for the governments to identify the core group of private people hiding behind all the debt shell entities who are supposedly ""owed"" money by these countries citizens. Those citizens likely never voted for the debts anyway. Collectively the governments should all subjugate all these false debts to the rights of the people in a national worldwiode form of eminent domain. 

Austerity for millions is not an acceptable situation to recognize diffuse, ""debts"" often made by politicians serving the very ""creditors"" rather than the people.


Millions of people should not be forced into a lifelong form of loss of freedom (which is what ""Austerity"" really means on an individual level for each citizen) as a result of putting false debts unto the backs of their governments.

India reports [24

In the US, and although many victims also don't come forward, the reporting rate is much better, at about [54%](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf) of rapes not reported (to give the US an advantage in its reporting rate, we can round down to 50%).

The US has roughly 1 quarter of India's population (US has 300 million

So to compare them,000 rapes/year in the United States. We take India's and multiply it by 10 to account for under-reporting, we get 240,000 rapes/year in India. Factoring in under-reporting (which is pathetically low in India, the UK, and the US -- although admittedly way better in the US than the UK or India), **the US still has slightly under 3 times the number of rapes as India per year.**

As for the law -- conviction rates for accused rapists

Conviction rate in India: [26%](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/04/statistics-conviction-rates-for-rape-across-india/)

Conviction rate in the US: [5%](http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates)

Conviction rate in the UK: [5%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/28/AR2008052803583.html)

**Rapists are convicted 1/5th the time in the US/UK compared to India. India's conviction rate is itself astonishingly low

If anything, namely in the US and UK, is even worse. So blaming India's culture/nation for rape is, if anything, a way to distract people from the even worse rape crisis in some parts of the West!

What wont be in the news however is the shear force trying to counter the effect of these rallies. Today a full 24 hours before the organised demonstrations there have been road blocks from all points of access to the 'allowed' point of assembly. Just so support is not as strong as propagandized main thoroughfares have been blocked such that even normal citizens have been delayed in excess of 4 hours without any form of notice or reason outside of simple rumor.

The source of this whole unrest is a far more interesting matter. Malaysia from 1981-2003 was led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad a charismatic fellow who envisioned a islamic inspired capitalistic democracy. Having been in charge for so long he was corrupted by a messiah complex that lead to a rather weak heir to his legacy who was overturned quite easily by stronger forces in the ruling party. This new force (Najib Razak) has a rather colourful history. There have been allegations of morally objectable action with a mongolian model who was found blown to pieces by a grenade along with some other more questionable accomplishments.

This has led to a rather forced march to global acceptance and respect to further profit a ruling class that is inundated with corruption and nepotism.

Thus we are at present day with an unhappy growing middle class

A lot of people already know these

**Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the leader of Iran.**

The President of Iran is not the leader of Iran. Political power is largely held by the [Supreme Leader of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran)

**The President of Iran is going to try to destroy Israel**

Some have pointed out that Ahmadinejad's comments regarding Israel being ""wiped off the map"" can be translated as referring to the political entity

**Ahmadinejad is too loony to have control of nukes**

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has [no say in Iran's nuclear policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad#Nuclear_program), and even things he does have a say in can be vetoed or overridden by the Supreme Leader, and in fact have been.

**Ahmadinejad is representative of Iran's religious leadership**

Actually, and [others seemed to come down on the side of the protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Iranian_election_protests#Clerics).

**Iran's military is a joke**

While they wouldn't be able to withstand a full scale assault by the US military (who could?), and enough marine mines, missiles, and torpedoes that they could do enough damage to tanker traffic (or threaten to) to [shut down oil flow through the Straits of Hormuz for several months](http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/more.php?news_id=92875&amp;date=2012-01-06) if they wanted to. The US could easily sink most of their navy, or at least the bigger stuff, but Iran has a large fleet of fast smaller vessels used to fire anti-ship missiles, launch torpedoes  (including the scary [Hoot supercavitation torpedoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoot_%28missile%29)), including an Iranian version of the fairly deadly (even to large aircraft carriers) [Chinese EM-52 rocket mine](http://www.strategycenter.net/research/pubID.117/pub_detail.asp).

**Iran is building a nuclear weapon**

The IAEA actually reports that Iran's nuclear program, that they continue to allow international monitoring to prove they aren't building weapons, but that the IAEA saw signs that they think mean that at some point in the future Iran might be capable of starting a nuclear weapons program if they want to. So not only do they currently not have a bomb, they aren't developing them, and they aren't even capable of building a weapon at the moment should they want to. But they might want to in the future. Either way, any potential Iranian nuclear weapon is years in the future, and the world would have plenty of warning that they were actually building one (they'd stop allowing inspections

**EDIT** - an example to clarify the difference between a nuclear weapons development program and being nuclear capable: Lets say that I decide that someday I want to build a gun in my basement workshop. There are certain steps that I know I need to take before I can even start. I need to understand metalworking, and understand something about explosions and basic physics. I can buy a lathe, learn metalworking, take chemistry and physics courses, and even apply some of those useful skills to other stuff *without actually making a gun.* I'm just getting to the point where I can make one if I want to. When I actually decide to go ahead and start making one, you'll see all kinds of bright flashes from my basement, hear loud noises, that kind of thing.

What the IAEC report shows is a lot of signs that Iran is at stage one, and infrastructure that they would need to develop a nuclear weapon. Stage two will be when they have the knowledge and equipment, and that's what's called nuclear capable. Even then, they still won't have an active weapons program. Stage three is when they actually decide to go ahead and build it, and that's actual nuclear weapons development. At that point they won't be following their treaty agreements, so IAEC inspectors are told to leave, and they start producing weapons grade nuclear material. Even then

But that's assuming they will want to go ahead with it when they have the ability. By then

Maximum estimate - 1'033'000



[2007 Article on Iraqi death estimates in war on terror](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=6848).

At the time of this article the 'official' count was 75'000. The article cites [a study that found about 75% of civilian deaths in conflict zones go unreported](http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/11/counting-the-war-dead.html). Referencing other data the article estimates it could be as high as 1'200'000. Five years ago.

Considering the implications of that study, it seems very probable that the US's war on a word has killed more than 1'200'000 civilians in the past decade. 

And if we compare american and non-american civilian fatalities; for every single american civilian killed by 'terrorism' on and since 9/11 in this war between 40 to 400 non-american civilians lay dead. 

The US total losses in the 'war on terror' is ~9'000 (military and civilian). If the war on terror has caused an even million deaths
