1374725593.0,1j09dc,Just sent my girl off to spend the night with another guy - really excited for her... (xpost from /r/nonmonogamy),sexplus-anon,76,12,20,"Ecstatic to have a sex-positive story to share!

I've been in a relationship with my girl (let's call her B.) for three years, but we like some variety, adventure, and the occasional validation from others.

We've talked about being casually open throughout our relationship. However, we haven't been able to make it work. Several things got in the way: our shared focus on a particular type of openness (no poly/emotional relationships and no pickups, only FWBs); social constraints due to heavy work schedules; communication issues; and some really unfortunate timing during a few opportunities.

With all of those complications, or whether we were only OK with openness in theory...

Last weekend

For several years, and we often host visitors). We agreed, and since B. had to work most of last weekend, C. and I made friendly plans to hang out. B. and I knew that C. is pretty sexually open - one of our group sessions was with C. and her guy at the time - so it seemed possible, but we had no expectations.

As soon as C. arrived, and C. and I spent most of the night making out on the couch. We took it really slow - clothing didn't even start coming off until after an hour of heavy making-out - but it was intense. C. and I spent most of Saturday and a little while on Sunday in full-on hookup mode (while still managing to keep our evening social plans with B. and others).

B. and I sent C. back home on Monday. That evening, almost ritualistically - very powerful experience), and had sex. It wasn't intense or prolonged (truth be told, I was a little spent), but it was the emotional reconnection and closure that we both really needed.

Throughout the weekend

I was deeply moved and grateful for her openness - and I really wanted to return the favor. ""Some day

But by sheer luck, the timing is perfect.

""Would you be OK with me seeing him tonight?""

""YES! Have fun! Be safe!""

We share a car, filled it up with gas, and came home to turn it over to her.

""I have no idea what to expect tonight. Things might work out

""Whatever happens is fine, let's say, 10am tomorrow.""

I sent B. out the door 30 minutes ago

Some observations:

1) Timing. Motherfucking TIMING. Like normal relationships

2) My hookup with C. kind of flipped a switch in my mind about the context.

While both B. and I want occasional sex with others as a supplement to our relationship, and I trust her completely - it's just a product of lingering social anxiety that I've been working on my entire life.

Sex with C. put it in perspective. My emotions and mental calculus finally hit home:

This isn't a big deal.

To be clear, and I'm hoping that we can meet up again - but basically, it was just some friendly, fun screwing with a friend. It didn't change my relationship with B. at all. Sex with C. finally gave me a mental framework for totally accepting and supporting B.'s own sexual adventures.

B. has been saying that all along

3) Sex with C. not only satisfied my cravings - it also strengthened my relationship with B. First, the variety of sex with C. reminded me and made me appreciate what I've loved about sex with B. (not as a competition, but simply as recognition of the contrast).

4) Maybe the most important thing that reinforces the OK-ness of this all is: developing a relationship safety net. Throwing a little more time into my relationship with B.

So that's my story. Hope it's helped some of you and entertained others. I'll be eager to read your feedback

Scenario 1: Long-lost twins meet for the first time and are attracted to each other. They engage in totally kinky

Scenario 2: A parent rapes their 16-yr old child.

It really bothers me that whenever something like scenario 2 happens

I got a bunch of downvotes in a TrueAskReddit thread about incest, because it seems obvious to me that we can be comfortable with scenario 1 without having to get into those creepy reddit discussions about grooming and how difficult it is to determine consent, etc, because where there definitely IS consent, there is definitely no problem.

But when most people hear the word ""incest

So on one hand, you see these abstract discussions about pederasty like we're suddenly in Ancient Greece and that's somehow not a bad thing.

I'm making this post, whereas the more common/mainstream use of the word should be militantly condemned as a manifestation of rape culture, using ambiguous language about something which should not be ambiguous in the least, namely rape.

I guess a possible alternative would be to decide that ""incest"" refers only to cases of coercion

Internal condoms have been my go-to for STI and pregnancy protection during penetration for almost three years.  Here is list of tips

* Internal condoms are non-latex and cannot cause allergic reactions.
* You can put them in long before you have sex. No need to stop sexytime to make the condom happen. You can grind all up and down your partner before you ever fuck
* You can get your partner to put it in for you. Unlike putting a condom on with your mouth
* It is easy to alternate between fucking and oral sex. Internal condoms don't have a taste the same way latex condoms do, on your chest, or whatever you've negotiated.
* They're quite handy for multi-person sex. If two female-bodied people want to fuck one male-bodied person
* Internal condoms can be used for a safer DVP (double vaginal penetration).  Note that there is no way to perform a ""completely safe"" DVP with three warm bodies.  At least two partners must be fluid-bonded or not use protection together.
* Unless you mess them up (which admittedly a lot of people do)
* Another fun thing about internal condoms is spontaneity. If you have a partner restrained and blindfolded
* Use lots of lubricant. If it feels like having sex with a garbage bag
* There are actually two kinds of internal condoms, I'd guess about 1 in 20 is a FC1.
* You can use the internal condom rectally, but then again, neither are traditional condoms. An added bonus is that the external part of the condom will protect you from potential poo.
* Internal condoms are a great option for people with external frits (read ""front bits""). If you're smaller, it streamlines sex when you don't have to put on a new condom each time you get an erection.
* Internal condoms are not damaged by the same temperatures as latex condoms. If you were camping in the heat of summer
* Most people have never used an internal condom. It can be a difficult conversation to bring up. ""Hey, try bringing it up before you get to a sexual scenario so they'll know to expect it. Bonus points if you're cool about it and can help them put it in (assuming you are doing the penetrating).

I hope this convinces you sexy people to try sexy sex with a sexy internal condom.  I receive no karma for this post

1375198802.0,1jcqsd,Sent my girl off for a night with another guy - terrifically positive experience! (update) (xpost from /r/nonmonogamy),sexplus-anon,65,12,4,"An update to the [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1j09dc/just_sent_my_girl_off_to_spend_the_night_with/)...

As my girl, I was riding an emotional high - this was exciting, and I really enjoyed supporting her adventures. But I wasn't sure how my emotions would respond.

I made one request of her: Please be back by 10am. (We had a 1pm obligation that required our mutual attendance

She agreed

My evening apart from B. started out fine - ordered some pizza, what if, what if...? Of course, it was all nonsense - my relationship with B. had been rock-solid, and our sex life was consistently great - and I knew better than to give them any credence, but the buzzing in the back of my mind was becoming a nuisance.

Two things helped.

First, I don't depend solely on her for my needs. The weekend with C. was fulfilling for many reasons: developing a closer relationship with a friend; the basic pleasure of physical contact; a reminder that I am desired and desirable; the feeling of personal growth into a new area; and of course, some great, fun sex. In addition to simply enjoying the memories, it reminded me of what the weekend had been about - and that that's the experience that B. was having with D. that evening.

Second, because I really wanted to talk to her and I knew she'd be up late. Our discussion neither avoided nor focused on B.'s evening with D.; we just talked about everything - life, work, hobbies, the past weekend, future plans to see each other. Feeling the strength of a social connection further steadied my nerves, and when my thoughts returned to B. after our call, again

Our bed felt huge and empty that evening, when B. texted me:

*I'm coming home.*

A sense of calm and happiness washed over me

Bless her heart

I joined her, and we love *talking* about sex, so this was just a sharing of experiences. That these experiences were brand-new, and had arisen during our relationship, felt... completely irrelevant, actually.

(Sadly, D. admitted that he's having a bit of difficulty with the situation: he would really like to *date* B., but that's not what she wants, and he wants to be careful with his emotions. Props to him for recognizing the difficulty; B. is giving him space to work through it.)

Going forward: B. and I are talking a lot about how where things might go. Our circumstances with C. and D. are different, B. and D.'s relationship is more casual - closer to a booty-call relationship - but D. may be moving to our town for work, so it could be more common. Because of the differences, B. and I are talking constantly about these relationships to ensure that we're still on the same page, and still OK with each others' actions.

I'm sensitive to all of the ways that we could fuck up this arrangement: neglecting each others' needs and our relationship; letting our other relationships become serious; a relative imbalance in our side activities; etc. Seems like good communication can mitigate those problems.

**tl;dnr**: Everything that I'd *hoped* would happen from the first post has come to pass.

I have considered myself a feminist for about two years now but absolutely hate when feminists put other women down for doing what they want with their own bodies. Yes I don't think women should be seen as simply sexual objects but I don't think things such as modeling or even porn really cause any gender inequality in themselves. There is some other issues around them but there is no reason to hate on the industries as a whole. 

I also really dislike when people say that you can't be a feminist into BDSM as this is making so many untrue assumptions such as all feminist are women when in reality anyone who is willing to fight for gender equality could be considered a feminist. It is also assuming that if a woman is taking part in BDSM she is always being the submissive one

I've never saw myself as a terrible person
About a couple of years ago, it kind of got out of hand. Now I know sex doesn't always come from a kiss, but this was a special kiss...
Anyway, and I don't even recall how she got naked. It wasn't me. I felt like she was being attacked, of course now I realize it was me. There was a dildo in there, never penetrated her, but just kind of teased her. I don't even know how those got there. The others left the room, and I stopped and asked if she wanted to continue. She said no, so I helped her up and put a blanket around as she sat down on the couch and passed out. The next morning I got up and left

Well she comes up to me a year later telling me of how she felt of the situation. I thought it was mutual till she told me that she felt violated. When I heard that I couldn't believe my ears. I didn't know how to react, I couldn't believe what the fuck I did. At first I wanted to tell all my friends, just to be open about the situation (protected her name), but eventually I grew quite as the shame and hatred for what myself grew more and more. I try so hard to be kind and play safe and be cautious, but one fucking night I don't even know.....

She has contacted me a few times, but they say that won't do anything. She says she's getting over the trauma which is great to hear, but I know that I have directly made an enemy in the world now.

Anyway I needed to share the story, and only those who are interested in talking about the current way sex is dealt in society are on this subreddit. I never saw her as a lesser or greater individual before and after the event. I do see myself beneath her though (and now she has emails so that's digital proof of something) and all I want to do is make her feel better, and live beyond it. She said she wasn't going to let that part of her life define her and that that part of my life define me. I'm just so full of shame-I feel shitty, I wanna die.",,False,,False,t3_1491vs

[Here is the thread in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/119fjl/fellow_ladies_do_you_mind_lots_of_body_hair_on_an/)

Every bit of marketing that I've seen since I was a kid has shown me men with hairless bodies

I've made many google searches only to find hairless men:

* male models - shirtless surprisingly often
* condom ads - rarely including pictures of shirtless men
* beer ads - same as condoms
* razor ads - I was thinking of leaving these out
* fire fighter calendars - stereotypical male soft porn
* romance novel covers - I was expecting every image to be filled with hairy men

I would also like to add that I have been ashamed of my body hair ever since puberty, trimmed it, etc.  I would be waxing it now if it wasn't for the price and pain involved.  I have worn shirts with high collars to hide it, thinking everyone would be repulsed by it.

And now, I am impressed that these constant images have seemingly little effect on women's desires.

I'm considering taking him up on it, just for the sake of exploring this dimension of sexuality that I have otherwise never identified with.

Do any straight males have experience with this?  I guess I'm wondering if this will be too much of a mind fuck for me...or maybe it's really no big deal.  What are the challenges of integrating an experience like this?

Celebrate sex; it's playful

Celebrate sexual desire (the hungry

Sexual needs are important.

People feel miserable when their sexual needs aren't met.

Give a helping hand (or mouth, or pussy) to people around you who have a hard time having their sexual needs fulfilled.

There's bad sex out there

Show compassion to people whose sexuality has been injured; we all need time and support to heal our wounds.

It's not everyone who is comfortable with sex; be mindful of that. We hope they get there someday

If your sexuality has been hurt

If you're blessed with a healthy

Sex workers provide a valuable service by helping people meet their sexual needs; they're an important part of our community. The problem is not their work

Forever alone? It's hard, take good care of yourself.

Look at what makes people attractive

Look at people around you

Compliment people on the things that make them hot. How come so many people feel unattractive?

Masturbate! Fantasize! You deserve the pleasure

Make porn! Write some, or film some.

What's in your pants matters

Gender matters, love, and get horny.

It's okay if you are monogamous at the moment, and only one, person for the next 50 years of your life?

It's fine to be in love with more than one person at a time! Love is not a finite resource. It's a blessing to have more than one amazing person in your life.

It's okay if you don't feel like having sex right now. Take the space you need

If you have a kink

It's okay to express your curiosity about your friends' sexuality. No one should shame you for being curious.

It's okay to ask friends if they'd be cool with showing you how they have sex. It's not normal that you've seen strangers in porn fuck more often than you've seen your own friends have sex.

It's okay to have sex with friends! Friend sex can be awesome! Do it right

Organize a sex party! Like all sex

Condoms give us the freedom to fuck around safely! The condom god must be worshipped and honoured! ;)

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Ask! “Would you like it if we did that?”

Reassure! “It's okay if at any point you change your mind and want to stop or do something else. I'm here for you.”

Check in! “How are you feeling? Are you enjoying yourself?”

Speak out! “I'd love to do this! Do you want to?”

Respect! No means no. Unless there's a safeword. ;)

Between yes and no, and who knows – you might end up having more fun than you thought you'd be having.

If everybody had their sexual needs met

If we're all a bit more open

Be the best sexy human being you can be! :)

EDIT: Wow. I'm saddened and disappointed at the amount of vitriol in the comments. This manifesto comes straight from my heart

To the asexual people I have offended

To the couple of people who have leveraged the accusation the manifesto is not sex-positive... *shrugs* You can keep your toy. I have no issues with just calling it ""A Sex Manifesto"". I'm convinced however that there are plenty of people on this sub who thought it was sex-positive. In fact, that we should enjoy it as much as we want, and that we should celebrate it. There's enough people who will gladly remind everyone of how dangerous and bad sex can get (and as a sexual abuse survivor, I know a page or five on that). I also believe that everyone here is savvy enough to understand that you don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

I beg to differ.

My definition of a successful relationship is one in which:
1) The balance of pleasure against pain is overwhelmingly pleasure.
2) Lessons were learned (on either side or both).
3) You did not part ways as enemies
4) You would do it over again

People come and go in our lives...I believe we need to allow those comings and goings without looking at them as failures. Learn your lessons

The deep intimacy of a long relationship is something most people really want. But we have all seen relationships that have endured for too many years in a state of mutual torture.

I'm not saying a long relationship is bad and short ones are good...rather

I know I would.

A couple years ago, just oral/fingers/toys, no PIV. We hooked up with this friend a few more times under those circumstances, then circumstances changed with that friend so no more adventures happened there. Figured that it was a fun time and we wouldn't be going down that road again.

Fast forward

See, and despite being VERY committed to each other at almost 7 years together we both have confessed to curiosity of what it's like to ""be with"" other people in the PIV sense of the word, and in our romps thus far she's had very little opportunity to fool around with another man at all (basically limited to a short bit of time in the foursome, mostly I've been the lucky guy since she likes playing with girls). While she likes playing with women she also wants a chance to play with men in general. While I have some trepidation about including another man, I want to think I can get over this and give her the same opportunity I've had (via an MFM, or MFMF/variant) even if I'm not interested in playing with another man, and prefer to focus with another man on my woman or his woman.

In a world of perfect equality there has to be some homeostasis, and if we can't, how then do we break down this double standard when the gap between the men who actually are thinking of the women they have casual sex with in this way, and the feminists who believe that that group are the only type of men in existence is so vast, and every voice in the middle gets lost behind a constant chanting of ""sexual women are sluts"" and ""men who want sex from women are pigs""?

1339986016.0,v7do8,The Paradox of Sex-Positive Language: How sexuality terms perpetuate the categorization and generalization of sexual identity.,Veritas1982,26,5,11,"Over the last few years as sex positive information has been increasingly available, they are re-evaluating their own sexualities and gender identities within this enlightened, an individual can be any particular 'shape'

However, naturally, create terms for them so that we can communicate. So in terms of gender and gender identity, we no longer have only male, female, and transgender. We have cisgender, trans, sexually cisgender but socially trans

However, we commit two crimes, both against ourselves. 

The first, cisgender male, bottom, who is masochistic but decidedly dom rather than sub, you are actually INCREASING the number of generalizations and assumptions that person is making about your sexuality. For every label their is a set of assumptions that someone can apply (here we are not focused on genuinely sex positive people as the audience, because the struggle for sexual freedom is not against those who are genuinely sex positive and open minded). As you list off the labels you have agreed apply to you, you are listing off a set of assumptions that your are granting someone permission to make about you. You are actually offering them a menu of assumptions and prejudices to apply to you. This is the first crime

The second, rather than being content to simply be ourselves, with no label. So if you've decided you're a bi female, you may 'force' yourself to participate in sexual acts that you don't genuinely enjoy simply because you feel it's 'what you should do, if that is your sexuality'. For example, let's say you love giving oral sex to another girl, but only enjoy receiving oral sex from men, there's no reason I shouldn't like this

There is this great paradox where we claim that we are seeking sexual freedom, the first thing we want to do is slap a label ON OURSELVES, categorize our sexuality, and determine what we 'should' or even 'could' do next, according to what the label prescribes we do. We stop allowing our desires to guide us freely, because we are so obsessed with picking a category.

Fight the paradox. Refuse to label your sexuality. Just. . . be. Just be yourself, of course). It's none of anyone else's business, and it is NOT their right to ask you for a neat and tidy little label that they can slap on your sexuality so that they can keep you organized in their mind. Are you bi? Are you gay? So are you a butch or a femme? So wait, you have short hair, you talk like a guy, you act butch, and now you want to wear a girlie dress to the party? These are all questions that lead into each other

Stop asking yourself if your cis or trans, or NO anal play, are femme or butch, or flamboyant or macho or conservative. Just let yourself be free, to be yourself, whatever that looks like. When someone asks something like ""So are you bi?"" Just smile warmly and genuinely, look them in the eyes, and I don't really care to jump to conclusions about myself,,

i’m a Masters student and technically speaking my thesis proposal was due thursday but thirteen days ago (after submitting my proposal over a month prior) i woke up to an email from my advisor saying that if i did not change my thesis

it was pretty much the worst feeling in the whole world.  i have been laser focused on my topic for three years.  this was topic that made me apply to grad school

i was in third year when i came up with this topic.  i was going to do my final course essay on it
so i did.  i spent a year in violent, in the library, anywhere i could to stay safe and focused.  i busted my ass to get into grad school. 

and then ten days out - flash.  bang.  it was gone.
ethics issues were the problem.  the ethics of online research are not set in stone and i was told (and i quote) “if you had six months to fight with ethics

so i’ve had to start a whole new topic.  out of the blue

so consider this a cry for help.  ***i am looking for any first person writings (be it in an autobiography, etc.), published from the year 2000 to present day, from North American cis-gendered white, Black, or Canadian Aboriginal women who have engaged in prostitution or exotic dancing.  i am also looking for any online resources (NOT personal blogs - ethics says noooooo) of the same.***

i am essentially uglycrying for help.  its like trying to fit in doing three years worth of research in just over two weeks and i wasn't even given clear guidelines for my topic until this past thursday.

My friend and I are tentatively planning on opening a sex shop in the next few years. It would feature a wide selection of safe, where we could host classes and other events. We would seek out knowledgeable staff members (worker-owner style, a co-op type of thing) who represent a range of sexual and gender identities. We would not carry any mainstream porn. We have a pretty clear vision, but we would benefit from your input and suggestions. Here are my questions for you:

1.) What are some of your favorite sex shops? (What is it called and where is it?)
*Side note: Major plus if you can recommend places in the Southeastern U.S./Carolinas that we should visit (cities like Athens, Richmond, etc...)

2.) What makes a great sex shop? (Specifics appreciated!)

3.) What features do you think subtract from the experience of shopping for sex accessories? Why?

4.) Is there anything that you've wished for in a sex shop but never seen?

5.) What sex toy/accessory can you not do without?

1316959534.0,kqubi,Struggling with and accepting your kinks,fetthrowaway333,27,5,42,"Obvious throwaway account. I was brought up in a non-religious household, which probably contributed to the following. 

When I was about 13 I realised I had strange feelings towards certain women (for the sake of keeping this on-topic, naturally I was very confused. At least, I understood the *concept* - I was supposed to like attractive women (which 13-year old me defined as the few images of pornstars I had inadvertently stumbled accross on the internet) right, so what the hell was this? 

My tiny immature mind refused to accept it, followed by a wave of guilt). I avoided discussing sex, was too nervous to ever seek out a relationship for fear of someone discovering my terrible secret. Though I was too afraid to speak to anyone I knew  I sought help online several times, and then ignored the people telling me to relax. that a fetish was nothing to beat yourself up about (unless you're in to that).

My breakthrough finally happened at the beginning of this year, but actually *embracing* it. I never realised someone could be so open and accepting - and for good reasons, since I'd tried to cut myself off from sex entirely until I had 'straightened' myself out. I started listening to other peoples stories, first on the podcast then on other places on the internet, eventually to here on reddit.

And once I had finally realised the obvious, and much less anxious. My fetish has just become another small part of my life. I'm now courting a lovely girl for the first time, and my life is infinitely happier.

Update time! After reading over the wonderful advice everyone gave in my last post, followed later by my SO and Mike. We kept it relatively low key - fingering and toys, except for the oral that I got from Anna at my SO's encouragement.

All went well! We were fooling around, and fooling around again until almost 4 AM when we went for a Denny's run prior to calling it a night. We definitely plan to do so again. My only regret was not going down on Anna, since she and Mike had not been screened recently and while they've each been with very few partners I insisted that we all be up to date on screenings before the point of unprotected oral sex. No one was really interested in dental dams, so there you go.

The other gentleman was in fact larger than I am, after screenings are done. And in the interim I've bought a new mattress (something I've been needing to do anyways), and it's a king size :D [SO MUCH ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FpBjN7MYSuw/UL0xDilZ9fI/AAAAAAAAAe0/u0EchNYIINM/s320/tumblr_mded1mklTP1qfvgpgo1_500.jpg)

The farthest we've gone? Me eating a whole pint of Ben&amp;Jerry's (temperature differences in bed turn me on- ice cubes are amazing) while in cowgirl (condom goes on BEFORE)

If it's any consolation

**TL:DR: My SO likes when I eat during sex because he fantasizes about me gaining belly weight

I hear a lot of people say ""my body is not a fetish"". I just don't think I mind that my SO loves my body- especially the more cuddly parts. It's really helped me accept my weight and take care of my body better.

I'm male, which has perpetuated itself and always left me feeling inadequate, especially with this last girlfriend.  She expressed her preferences for ""rough sex"" which, due to my inability to last and being easily discouraged, I was never really able to provide the endurance or enthusiasm.  

This has been a big confidence-killer for me.  Now that I'm single the sexual urges still come from time to time, though I'm open to other forms of, hm, mental stimulation.  So currently I feel very alone and very horny, but I have this apprehension about masturbating because it feels like a reminder that I am single and sexually inadequate.  I'm almost afraid to do it because in the back of my mind I'm thinking about how my ex could easily go out and get gorilla-fucked by whoever she'd prefer if she wanted to, and it just adds to the insecurity.

I generally have this feeling that I have not fully realized my sexual potential i.e. I consistently feel unsatisfied, which makes me feel this pressure to be confident and free as well.  

Can anyone provide some insight or resources?

Thanks!

I went to the Alexander McQueen exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art yesterday. There was some clear genius in his work. It made me think and helped some obscure thoughts coalesce. I feel inspired to pay closer attention to my primal side for the sake of my mental health. These are some thoughts.

My childhood upbringing involved labeling the human primal instinct and nature Evil, well through puberty and well beyond my point of reaching sexual maturity. Internally I automatically rejected these teachings. It was damaging to my mental and emotional development to be entirely denied of childhood romances, and instead to be trained to deny my own natural desire to experience closeness with women. I was taught that I was too young. This teaching continued for several years too long. I was strongly discouraged by my mother against seeking a girlfriend at all, so the subject of whether or not I was being abstinent was never even a question. It would have been better for me to be permitted at least some degree of intimacy with girls my age, so at least even a small emotional connection with a girl would have been available to me. Such a connection would have been healthy for my emotional development. The deprivation caused serious depression in my preteen and teen years. I became an outcast in high school because eventually I was too far behind the curve in the arena of intimate connections to be able to successfully connect with and relate to my peers. My mother rejected outright my suggestions that I was depressed, and my desire to seek professional help.

Now I feel it is important for me to pay close attention to my primal nature

In summary, and atheism are important to me.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,True,,

I didn't really have the best ""sex talk"" growing up. It lasted about 10 minutes and I was left feeling like sex was a pretty bad thing. I didn't even make the connection that what I was doing was an orgasm until I was in my 20s and began studying sex on my own since my partners weren't really getting me off. I also sought counseling for my sexual abuse and eventually developed a more sex-positive attitude. I've experimented with kegels and sex toys

However, not even my husband. It is not achievable during penetration (edit: or any other partner or other kind of self-stimulation). I thought kegels would possibly bridge the gap, and I would be able to achieve it through other means, but so far it hasn't worked.

My questions (long time getting here...

As soon as my roommate left for class

I've never done this before but have kinda recently been fantasizing about my gf/so tying me up/pain among other things. So, broke out a belt that I knew if I wiggled enough it would loosen up and put on a sock hat over my eyes and got undressed except for my socks haha(my feet were cold!). I wasnt really worried about getting stuck tied there because if worst came to worst I'd just have a very awkward day with one of my good friends after he untied me lol

First I stuffed a washrag as much into my mouth as possible(made sure my nostrils were clear!) I tied my hands together and to a metal bar under my couch with my belt. I put the hat over my eyes and kinda braced my legs against another part of the couch. (Ideally I wish my legs were tied too but that requires another person probably)

It was fucking awesome. I've never been tied up before but it got me going crazy and a totally different mindset. I really really like the feeling of being tied up

Only two problems: I was getting pretty into it but my leg got stuck for about 10 seconds and of course I freaked and stopped all I was doing. I wish I would have gone longer but I was way out of the mindset at that point. I got my hands out very quickly and it was no prob getting my leg out. And my wrists kinda hurt while I was doing it but I'm not afraid of a little pain ;)
I started the traditional fap and sat on an empty booze bottle while i finished (clarify: the broad side of the bottle not the top owww)hahah.

My roommate came back probably 10 min after I was done because his class was canceled. So that could have ended horribly hahaha.

Ok

Now, and a willing and enthusiastic one might I add? This guy added that most people have sex before getting to blow jobs... I'm the opposite. I want to explore every little bit of a person before taking that plunge. Not to mention I've communicated this to him VERY clearly. He says he wasn't trying to push me into sex, but wanted to make sure that I really wanted to give him a blow job and just wasn't doing it to do it.... 

I'm not willing to budge on the intercourse part. Until I'm fully comfortable with the idea, especially in a new relationship.

*Update*: So here's the situation. I talked with him and things kinda went down hill. I was very straight forward about my reasons for not wanting to have sex, just unusual and something he hadn't encountered. He states that he thinks I'm closed, guarded and shy and that its hard to approach sex with me because he's afraid he's going to scare me. This post from an earlier conversation is basically what I told him:

Idk what to think. It's not that I don't like sex. I just don't want to have sex with him. To me, he will be leaving for law school in a month or so. I see no reason to just sleep with someone, to me it means something, even if it doesn't to the other person. Its a personal thing that I don't expect others to understand.
This being said, its ok to move on right?) or if i'm really just making a call and deciding that if a 32 year old can't be as mature about sex and boundaries as my 22 year old self then I am perfectly capable of being alone again.
Don't get me wrong, at least in some capacity. When I feel cared for and desired, I'm a confident and classy lover, willing to take charge and dabble in all sorts of new adventures. But when I feel uncomfortable or unsure, I doubt myself, I doubt the motives of why someone is with me and I'm self depricating. I don't like that.
Lastly, in essence that's it right? I didn't miss some lesson, not being too idealistic or too pessimistic? Cause apparently its a foreign concept, or at least a fairy tale...

And this was his response...

Him: ""I initially thought you wanted to have sex with me. At first I didn't realize you were shooing me away. Yes I tried to engage you in sex. But you said no and I stopped. You make it seem like I'm going to rape you. That is serious and not a thought which should cross either of our minds when talking or thinking about sex. I've tried to be intimate with you and failed

So yeah

So the divide between the words used for male oriented vs female oriented oral sex has been bothering me for a while. On one side ""blowjob"" is a word that just rolls off the tongue, because oral sex is a lot of fun no matter the sex of the person receiving it.

Words are important, let's find a better term for female oriented oral sex!

I have two suggestions myself:
- A simple solution would be to use ""blowjob"" no matter the sex of the person receiving oral sex. That doesn't sound ideal
- For the past few month, and append ""job"" to sort of normalize it and make it part of the set of ""somethingjob""'s (""handjob"", ""blowjob"", ""titjob"" and so on). But the most important part is that **it's fun to say and it sounds like we're gonna have fun**, and I think that's what matters most.

So what do you guys call cunnilingus? What do you think of using ""blowjob"" or ""bunnyjob"" instead? Or do you think we should just stick to ""cunnilingus""?

I contracted HSV1 genitally about a year ago from my boyfriend at the time. He spread it to me through oral sex when he hadn't realized he was getting a cold sore. I was devastated. Since then I have had about 4 outbreaks. We stayed together for another year and just recently (2 weeks ago) broke up. While we were together I never really worried about unprotected sex with him. I'm on birth control and since he tested positive for the virus, last week, while on the rebound, I met this very nice boy. We met up for a first date and ended up very drunk and had sex. Honestly, I didn't think much of it since I am not showing any symptoms (I can always tell very early on what's going on down there) and we used a condom. Ok, so then we also met up the next evening (last night) and ended up in bed again. This time much more sober, but unfortunately the condom ended up slipping off inside of me and he finished without realizing what had happened. Luckily, I am still on birth control (Nuva ring)
He of course feels awful and I tell him that it's ok
Anyways...my questions are: What is the real possibility of me passing it onto someone else, what are the chances you will also contract it genitally? I mean if you already have it, can coming into contact with someone who has it genitally cause you to have an outbreak?

but as i have explained before, receptive, kind, and i could literally feel that she was just as happy to be there as she was, and even though i had just met this person, i don't think i have felt that close to anyone emotionally in a long time, let alone physically.

so when i get ""into bed"" all my inhibitions drop and i am able to be my happiest, but i know that I can't just up and go to sleep with random people, especially in my area which is definitely in the conservative christian side of things. That's when i heard about Sex-Positive culture, which promotes healthy sexuality and exploring, and kinda has the vibe of Free Love which has interested me before.

I guess i just want two things, which seems to be exactly what i need to feel comfortable expressing myself in not only a sexual way, but just in a way where i don't fear offending somebody

I can say that I'm a virgin over the anonymity of the internet, I could do everything but vaginal intercourse and I'd still be a ""virgin"" because the heteropatriarchal definition of ""sex"" is PIV intercourse.

Now I am absolutely not at all whatsoever looking to become the centre of attention and take airtime away from rape victims so this is why I'd like to run this idea by a few people first. I'm thinking I could tie my status in with the greater picture of consent, ""Look at me, I've never raped anybody, look at how awesome I am."" I'm all for ""allyship"" and showing support and solidarity so I figure I can find some kind of common ground. I'm all about consent over conquest, and male virginity is all about the failure or lack of conquest. Either way, if you're not on a sexual conquest, you're not a man so by some extension, if you get what I mean.

So what do you think

I’m interested to know, are there women who are really into visual stimuli the way men often are?  I mean, I have definitely enjoyed and gotten turned on by pron. But in general, I have to somehow buy in to the overall scenario. It can be cheesy as heck (the hunky pizza delivery boy), but if they are into it – and the women seem to be truly aroused – that’s what gets me. It’s not about the “stills” of what the body and the parts look like and how they fit together, it’s about her turn on and pleasure. If it’s well done, there is an underlying scenario – whether of dominance and submission
That is really different from a gay friend of mine who loves jacking off to 60 sec cum-shots

halle206:  so how come our messages never get far? lol. what i mean is am i in some way

me:  yeah

me:  Essentially

halle206:  ahhh

halle206:  so what are you looking for?

me:  So sorry about that. I don't really have time for a full on relationship because I've got loads of course work

halle206:  no strings fun

me:  Not exactly

me:  Someone I can hang out regularly with

me:  Is that quite common for guys on [site]?

halle206:  no i dont think it is really

halle206:  not the ones i chat to anyway

me:  So they're more into long term stuff as well?

halle206:  well im looking for someone who i can be with for at least 6 months

halle206:  i think so yer

halle206:  but problem for me is that.....lots of them believe casual sex to be an ok thing

halle206:  but i believe strongly thats its not

halle206:  and am lookin for someone who thinks the same

halle206:  so thats where most blokes go wrong

me:  What about if they've had casual sex in the past

halle206:  no way

halle206:  if they have done it then no way

me:  No way - as in you won't date them?

halle206:  yep no date from me

me:  How did you arrive at your opinions of casual sex?

halle206:  i want them to believe in respect for women!

halle206:  well iv always had them really

halle206:  just as iv grown up iv thought more and more about how wrong it is

me:  I say that just because it's relatively uncommon to find a non-religious person who also believes casual sex is always immoral

halle206:  yer i know

halle206:  im VERY unreligious too

**me:  Is it wrong if the woman enjoys it as well?**

**halle206:  yep**

me:  Also

halle206:  totally wrong everytime

me:  Because you believe the women are being exploited even if they enjoyed the experience?

halle206:  yay go atheists!!!

halle206:  nope just cos sex is the most intamate thing people can do.....so it should be saved for people you love only

** halle206:  the only time that is an exception is......**

**halle206:  if you are experimenting with same sex stuff!!**

me:  Why do you say that?

halle206:  well cos that person  cannot get into a relationship then have sex if they dont even know for sure if they like someone of that sex

halle206:  so they need to have sex first to see if they lik it

me:  I think that's a tenuous argument. I knew that I would enjoy sex with a woman before I actually did

me:  before she actually did.

me:  You don't need to do something to know that you will like it.

halle206:  well i can do more than imagine because im in this situation!!

halle206:  i think u do need to do it before knowing

me:  You're in a same-sex relationship?

halle206:  nope

me:  What do you mean by ""well i can do more...""

halle206:  but i feel that i need to have sex with a woman before i am able to get into a relationship with her

me:  So you are bisexual?

halle206:  nope im bi-curious!

me:  ahh okay

me:  So if you had sex with a woman and enjoyed it

** halle206:  but am finding it hard to experiment in order to see if i actually am bi. because i dont believe that casual sex is ok**

halle206:  yes i would

me:  Hmm. You're in a bit of a bind.

halle206:  yer i know dude lol

me:  I'll put my opinion out there: (but please don't go because this is fun!)

me:  I have had casual sex

me:  She enjoyed it as well

me:  Sex in relationships is better

me:  But sex outside of one is still great

me:  It is very possible to separate sex from romance

me:  They aren't intertwined

me:  Sex is just fun and people usually like doing fun things.

halle206:  i think if they arnt for you then they should be 

halle206:  i think its about love first then fun

me:  I'll admit that I did used to share that viewpoint

me:  But if two people enjoy something and no-one gets hurt

me:  then what is the harm in that?

**me:  Why is consensual casual sex between two mature adults wrong?**

**halle206:  cos its the wrong thing to do in my opinion**

**me:  That's not really an answer**

halle206:  cos you shouldnt be doing that because its meant for lovers

me:  Why is it meant for people in love?

halle206:  people who are in a loving relationship

halle206:  becasue its love making

me:  Having sex with someone doesn't make you love them

halle206:  its makes the bond betweeen people stronger...thats what its meant for...to show how much u love each other

halle206:  no but it often get people to have feeling for each other

halle206:  besides casual sex people do often get hurt

me:  It definitely makes the bond stronger within already established relationships

me:  I don't see why a fraction of people being hurt by something should exclude the majority from doing it

me:  People are killed in cars; it doesn't mean we ban driving

me:  or that driving is wrong

halle206:  but it can make one person lik the other when the other doesnt like em back

halle206:  people do often get hurt

me:  it can do

halle206:  besides its just like prostitution but you dont actually pay

me:  but most mature adults can deal with mis-matched feelings

halle206:  no they cant it had nothin to do with maturity

me:  Well I can't see us agreeing about this.

halle206:  so ur sayin that ur mature if you can block out all feelings. is that what ur sayin

halle206:  that not what mature really means

me:  No - I'm saying that if you get hurt after casual sex then eventually you heal

me:  Maybe you learn to do it less

me:  Maybe you have just as much casual sex

me:  It doesn't make it wrong

me:  Anywya

** halle206:  who says you eventually heal??? not everyone heals at all

halle206:  but thats why they have come to a therapist i suppose

me:  So you're saying you have a group of friends that have all been wrecked by casual sexual encounters?

me:  Because I have a group of friends (guys and gals) that high five over casual sexual encounters

halle206:  no not at all....im talking of friends and clients

**me:  But you do know personally at least one person who has never emotionally recovered from a bad casual sexual experience?**

**halle206:  yes**

**me:  How long has it been? Months

**halle206:  years**

**halle206:  and i know more than 1**

me:  Well I am honestly incredulous.

me:  Anyway

me:  I think that you should chat to the [University she goes to] LBGTQ people

halle206:  why?

me:  I think they might be able to help work through your bi-curious feelings

me:  They might also have some sex-positive material for you to read. It could be enlightening

halle206:  nah im just gunna go for the causal sex thing....but chat to the gal first about the whole thing

me:  Ok well I hope everything works out for you eventually

halle206:  but when iv sorted out whether i am or am not...then i certainly wont be doing it agian

me:  Good bye!

halle206:  bye

Even though I enjoy being intimate (well, both mentally and physically, I find myself fantasizing about women who would be SSBBWs in net-parlance (super-size big beautiful women, women above 350 pounds or so).  I keep on thinking to myself, ""Gee, wouldn't it be great if I could have sex with my current girlfriend (who is capable of more positions and who I feel really connected to, which I'm certain makes it feel better) and also have the occasional fling with larger women?""

For the record, but not quite (forgot the condom like a moron!).  Anyway, it was fun, but she lived really far away and started to have health issues, partly because of her weight (or her weight was because of her condition, it was based on co-morbidity).  We kind of drifted apart, because it was hard to meet up with her and she would often need to have a test done.  We just weren't able to get that close.  Anyway, but apparently in the Northeast, couldn't breath fully).

Is there any way I could bring up the idea of me having relationships with SSBBWs on the side, and I feel like I could have the occasional one-night stand without complicating my feelings for her.  However, I understand it would be a gamble to ask her.  Other complication: I haven't told her I like big women yet, but we haven't really had the ""what turns you on?"" talk yet.  She has body image issues, and I'm concerned bringing it up too soon/the wrong way would make her feel like I liked her because she was fat, thus she's fat.

TL;DR: Not sure if it's time to break up

I know it's kinda childish to ask for this kind of advice, on the contrary he's the laid back type and I'm becoming the more neurotic and angry boyfriend stereotype. Not without my merits I guess, I have this constant feeling that he's not contributing to our life together. 

Then again

I guess this is issue number one. 

I work in a bank and I get about 2.5 his salary, friday and saturday - but usually he stays a little bit more to get some after party in the morning, as it is his only time to relax. 

But I have this hard impression that half of what he's telling me is bulshit. He says he has a lot to do during the weekdays

So basically he's kinda like a liar, he doesn't seem to notice how much wasted time he has during his day. Add this together with some sort of guilt for not doing things, he seems paralysed. 

I've already managed to get him a psychologist

I guess the main issue about this is to hear that he'll do things, and whenever I press him on these matters, he'll complain that I'm asking for a housewife. 

How are these roles distributed in non-standard relationships? Am I being a jerk? Should I feel like he should be doing more of these chores

While that is a major problem

Again, I feel rejected, unattractive. It's really bad. And when we do have sexual contact, he seems like a dead body, barely looks at me, and just waits for me to finish. We already talked over and over about this, but somehow he's unable to let himself go when were together. 

Which leads to the fact that he complains that we don't cuddle or be in non-sexual situations. In my defense, cuddled in the sofa watching TV, without any sex. These last two weeks I've just had it!

On the other side the kind of sex I'm looking for is something intimated that I want to have with him

How does sex work in an open relationship? Are there any examples of couples that get all their sexual gratification without their SO? 

And the last issue is finance. 

We're always broke, he'll simply ignore. It seems that if I don't do all the work on that matter, he won't even try to help. Weekly market is a good example. Every sunday there's a free market across our street, and every sunday I'll go there to buy vegetables of the week, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, zucchini, peppers and whatever. It's just so cheap

This particular sunday I was with my family, and didn't even mention anything on sunday. I know sometimes people forget, but this goes back to something I mentioned earlier, he's always forgetting. 

I guess these would be our major issues, specially because I'm not sure if I'm right about this, or if I'm actually being a jerk and wanting a housewife to support me. 

Again

I just feel constantly let down. With someone I can't rely on or even trust. How can I be sure I want to end this relationship? He is a great person. I love spending time with him. And we have lots of gun together. 

BTW, but to no avail. 

Maybe I should just shut up and hang on a little bit more, even with some shrink helping him out. 

**FOLLOW-UP:**

I did some reading on ADHD and a lot of it seems to fit the profile. We had a talk yesterday about all of this and it was very very positive. 

I appreciate everyone's help and support =)

Still, OkC is really a lot about maintaining your profile and trying to message people and from there it's hit or miss. There's also lots of Redditers on OkCupid, as well as Fetlife which i'll talk about now. 

**[FetLife](http://fetlife.com/)**

I just found FetLife and it is similarly made by nerds, but it's certainly nice to see the community getting together. It's not ""exclusive"", but it would be nice if it wasn't directed for or away from kinksters, and just open to everyone. Still, the concept is sensible because they avoid the classic mistake of dating sites that focus on...dating. FetLife is much more about networking. Dating happens when you socialize and meet new people and eventually find someone who you like and likes you back. FetLife builds on mutual interests and doesn't emphasize the same things more conventional dating sites do. 

**[Pirate Date](http://piratedate.com/)**

The Pirate Bay has also been advertising Pirate Date on their homepage, and seems to prefer Facebook integration (but it's only an option, not required) but the idea is something like building up a real social network.

By my teenage years my negative self-esteem broke me down to the point of being barely functional. I drew away from everyone I cared about and spend the majority of my high school years alone. I didn't feel like I was worth anyone's time. I made myself believe everyone hated me and no one wanted to be around me. 

After grinding half of my way through high school it got to the point where every night all I'd wish for was just to not wake up again. I don't want to go into detail why I was like this because most people would just stop reading after a while

Anyway, and make it into a strength. The easiest and most apparent thing was my sexuality. I now identify as a pansexual. Getting to the point of accepting that required me to fight a lot of repressed urges. My family is fairly religious and not very accepting to these kinds of things so I learned early on to hide them. I spent most of my early years deluding myself into thinking they were wrong, that everything about me was wrong, and that being 'normal' was the only true image for me.

Through a lot of struggling and soul searching I came to reason that the various components of my sexuality that I taught myself to hate were harmless. I reasoned that they themselves could have no negative effect on my life or others as long as I was responsible. I was very naive to think it could be so simple. 

Fast forward three years, but my sexuality poses a direct conflict of interest. Suddenly this part of me that I've spent years accepting and securing is being threatened by someone I love. I hoped we could reach some sort of compromise but she refused.

I asked around on other subreddits but very few people were understanding. With what little help I could get I've managed to resolve the situation for now. I've worked really hard to accept my sex-positive mindset

I resolved to change my lifestyle for her... But every day it really hurts

This is all a completely new and frightening experience to me. I've spent most of my recent life alone, why I'm controlling her. I'm really not trying to do any of those things. I honestly just need help.

There is a naked person in my bedroom. You knock on the door, offends some people. When I invite you in and you see a naked person, I have accepted responsibility for understanding both of your rules and have consented on both of your behalves. You are not repsonsible for invading the other person's privacy; if they are offended then I am responsible. They are not responsible for revealing themselves to you; I am. I know some people who would say that the naked person should cover up just in case the newcomer does not want to see nudity. I know a few people who would say the newcomer should always ask through the door for anyone inside the cover up. I say that neither person is responsible for taking either of those actions, because I have absolved them through my actions and decisions on their behalf.

In another situation, who has experienced the sensation before. You walk up to me with a friend of yours, who I haven't met before. You say to your friend ""hold his hand"". How should I proceed from here? Having encountered this specific situation some hundreds of times I have mostly established that if the new person seems eager then I will allow them to grab my hand immediately and if they seem wary then I will explain what is going to happen to them first. I have upset a few people by not informing them of what would happen when they touched me. I have also scared away some people by explaining it to them, who I later found out did enjoy the sensation and would have wanted to try it, sans explanation. Many people will, at this point, say that I am partially (or even mostly or completely) responsible for the potential violation of consent here. You, have established by setting up the situation that YOU are willing to subject them to this sensation without their consent.

There is an alternate version of this scenario, and the device is simply sitting on a table. When you say to your friend ""touch that device"", and they follow your instructions, the total responsibility for the outcome is split between you and them. If I have responsibility in the previous scenario, where did it come from? Do you or they become less responsible for the outcome because of my participation?

This concept extends to sex. Some people want anonymous sex, with arranging for a friend to be fucked by multiple people that I knew and she did not, without her meeting them beforehand or them being able to identify each other during. I am currently involved in a similar situaton, although more aimed at second base than at fucking. How could any of my friends accept that invitation, without getting consent from her? They trusted me to enforce and implement their requirements. How could she ask me to have them do this, without getting consent directly from them? She trusted me to convey and enforce her preferences and requirements. I, as the initator and facilitator, and I accept responsibility for any errors in that regard.

Now, cover her eyes, pull down her top, and say to me ""lick her nipple"". You have chosen to offer third party consent on her behalf, for her to be topless in public. You have consented on behalf of the other people in the room, to be exposed to nudity. And you have consented on her behalf to be ignorant of my identity, to be touched sexually, nor even an isolated incident.

So, should you, would you accept consent from one person on behalf of another, and if so then for what actions? Are there things about their relationship that would affect your decision, such as if you know they are acquaintances, friends, lovers, in a D/s relationship, etc? Would you give that consent,False

I've formatted it with the code formatting rules here on Reddit because

Here it is:

    * What does cognitive science mean for sex-positive activism?
    ** Introduction 
       This talk is about words, and (as a non-expert)
       what the science around them might mean for sex positivity. I'm
       going to touch on word reclamation
       could mean in light of this ""new"" knowledge.
    ** Understanding Check: We're all sex-positivists here
       - don't wanna upstage the panel later
         say:
    
         ""Sex positivity is the position that what consenting adults do
         for pleasure is not inherently shameful or harmful.""
    ** Name Check: George Lakoff
    *** Reason
        - Enlightenment
          + Beliefs about Reason 
            1) Reason is conscious
            2) Reason is disembodied
            3) Reason is emotionless
          + Also
        - Modern cognitive science has shown that all of that is false
          1) Reason is unconscious
             - even when you reason consciously you do a lot of
               unconscious processing
          2) Reason is embodied 
             - it's in your brain!
          3) Reason is emotional
             - when people acquire brain damage in the emotional centers
               of their brains
             - instead
               can't ascribe a value to anything or tell good choices from
               bad. They can't make plans!
             - You can't be ""rational"" without emotion
          4) Words don't fit the world
             - words don't exist in a vacuum: they come pre-packaged in an
               envelope called a frame.
    *** Frames
        - A frame is a collection of anecdotes
          narratives.
        - ""Girl Next Door"" has a frame
          that people here for Maggie Mayhem's talk will recognize
          + The Girl Next Door is young, often
            bespectacled and usually a student
    *** Metaphors are circuits in the brain (1997)
    **** Metaphor is how we think
         - When experiences activate different parts of your brain at
           once
           from clouds and ground objects during a lightning storm.
         - When they connect
           metaphor. It's a physical link in your brain! And it's made
           stronger every time you see that metaphor in action.
         - We then project these bodily understandings of the world into
           abstract domains
    ***** primary metaphors
          - precede language acquisition
          - up for increase
          - warmth for affection
    ***** Other metaphors
          - I mentioned morality up there.
          - purity and corruption are our moral metaphors
    	+ have people do something nasty in an experiment and then
              give them the opportunity to wash their hands
              they jump at the chance
    	+ doing something nasty or ""immoral"" has made them feel
              physically dirty.
    ***** Mutual inhibition
          - some metaphors cancel each other out (nurturance and obedience
            to authority
    *** Reframing
    **** ""Virginity"" 
         - Metaphorically connects sexual inexperience with purity (thus morality)
         - Some sex educators have reframed this brilliantly (though I can't attribute)
           + your first sexual experience is your ""sexual debut""!
           + Completely evades entanglement in the frame of ""virginity"" as a word.
    *** Word reclamation
    **** ""Slut""
         - one of the first things that came up after SlutWalk got going.
         - But what is the frame the word ""slut"" is attached to?
           + Too much sex is bad
           + Being sexual will make you a victim
           + Implication that victimization is DESERVED.
         - We must be cautious using this word.
           + Since the word is connected to this frame
             and thus REINFORCE
             stereotypes of that frame.
           + This is the opposite of what we want.
         - We can change what the word means in our own communities:
           that's been done.
         - The general public will understand it differently
    **** ""Sex""
         - the term ""sex"" itself bears consideration in this light
         - Is it too big a concept to reframe? Possibly.
         - As a sex-positivist
           discourse about it.
    **** Reclaim frames
         - when a woman asks her partner to call her a dirty slut:
           + does NOT necessarily mean she believes she's immoral or dirty
             * If that were true wouldn't she just call herself that
               rather than ask her partner to do it?
           + rather
             associate carnality with dirtyness
             * would enhance the experience if that is how she understands
               sex physically.
         - So we as sex positivists can endorse the use of sex-negative
           metaphors and language for the mutual pleasure of consenting adults
           + THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION HERE
    ** Conclusion
       1) we want to be a rational movement
       2) We must understand framing and metaphor in order to reclaim
          frames used against us for our own use
       3) We must MASTER framing in order to tell the truth
       4) We must be careful not to work against our own interest when we
          try to reclaim words.",,t5_2r7c9,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/qixil/i_gave_a_short_talk_on_cognitive_science/

&gt;Sex is many things. It's a fun and extremely pleasurable activity, it's an intense bonding ceremony, and when you want it to be, it's a glorious expression of love; most importantly, sex is nothing to be ashamed of. These sentiments are often misconstrued, but please avoid stretching the truth. Nobody thinks that everyone should have to be open about their sex life if they don't want to, nor that anything about anyone's sex life should change, due merely to cultural norms

&gt;What is sex-positive? As [defined by Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_movement), those limits would be maintained. For instance, sex may not belong in the office, but sex outside of the office should never be cause for firing. While understanding such reasonable limits, the sex-positive movement opposes unreasonable and harmful limits on the expression of human sexuality.

&gt;Being sex-positive is being comfortable with our own sexualities and accepting of everyone else's without preconceived notions of what that is. I'm straight, she's transgender, we're polaymorous, they're not, and it's all okay! Most importantly, everyone should have the basic human right to express their own sexuality freely. Ironically, a sex-positive culture is a culture in which [sex is not an issue](http://sexwillhappen.com/what-is-sex-positive). If you're open enough with yourself

&gt;Why is it that the movie industry is so tolerant of so much violence yet won't allow even artful depictions of sex? Why is it that religious groups push for abstinence-only education, but also has proven to have no impact on the actual rate of sexual abstinence? Why is it that same-sex couples have to fight so hard for the same basic civil liberties as everybody else? Why is it that the very same laws that are supposed to protect youth are instead [criminalizing them en masse](http://freestudents.blogspot.com/2009/09/there-is-fury-and-and-sadness-inside.html) with punishments far exceeding those for murder, even for consensual acts within the same age range, for doing what is an expected element of growing up? Why is it that erotica is frowned upon when [40 million](http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/internet-pornography-statistics.html#anchor6), over 1 in 10, US Americans in 2006 admitted to regularly visiting internet porn sites and when all that viewership actively serves to [reduce sex crimes](http://www.slate.com/id/2152487/)? Sexual repression hurts society.

&gt;So let's fight all of this sexual negativity. Let's build a creative, and don't let societal norms and taboos stop you.

&gt;In this vein, so despite those potential consequences, i will do this as an act of retaliation against them. I think it'll be fun, i want to do it, and let's face it, we all watch porn.

&gt;People warn that i might regret it, great! I'm doing this because i want to oppose a society where that would be newsworthy, or anything frowned upon. It's just sex, naked bodies sharing a ritual as old as humanity itself. In the future they will wonder why we were so bothered by nude images and recreational sex. 

&gt;The final product will be a tasteful erotica which is not degrading to either partner. It will be distributed via torrent and the Internet Archive for free under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License, ""The Good Girl"".

&gt;So, i'm not doing this with a girlfriend because it isn't necessarily something i want tied to a relationship, both for the relationship and for the message i want to send. Lots of couples make sex tapes and lots of random actors who don't know each other make sex tapes. Meeting someone like-minded for this specific purpose and establishing a friendship-level relationship that can both sustain the project and last beyond it just makes more sense.

January 1 is CIRCUMCISION DAY — the day Catholics traditionally celebrate the circumcision of the Baby Jesus — and what better way to observe this ignominious day than to send a letter about YOUR circumcision (and your subsequent foreskin restoration

An initiative of the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project (CAN-FAP)!

Savage’s views on circumcision have become progressively more enlightened over the years. He wrote disparagingly about foreskin in the early years of ""Savage Love"", perhaps Dan will dedicate an upcoming column to unhappily cut men and sharpen his position on this controversial subject. 

The Savage Love email address: mail@savagelove.net

Some tips:

SUGGESTED LENGTH: max 200 words; THE SHORTER THE BETTER. Over the past several months

-Keep it personal. Don't claim that circumcision ruins sex or that circumcised men don't enjoy sex, has commented on this in the past.) It is fine to talk to talk about how circumcision ruined YOUR sex life — such details will differentiate your letter from the others — but don't assume that most other circumcised men are in the same boat as you. Feel free to indulge in a bit of dark humor or cynicism about your situation—this will endear you to Dan and his readers. Your real name will not be printed, and you can be creative with how you are signed... Dan likes cute acronyms! 

-Don't criticize Jewish/Muslim circumcision unless you are Jewish/Muslim yourself. If you are Jewish or Muslim

-Please don’t expound unsubstantiated or otherwise unproveable personal theories linking circumcision to a laundry list of personal and social problems. If you stick to your own personal sexual harm and how you feel about it

Please familiarize yourself with ""Savage Love"" a bit if you don’t know the column. (Don’t worry

***Please send your letter on January 1. Not before

If you would like another pair of eyes on your letter

Thanks for your attention everyone! Perhaps we could make this a yearly event?

PS. Please pass this event along!

From a 2004 article in Vancouver’s Georgia Straight:

Sex columnist Dan Savage isn't a supporter (of circumcision) himself; he and his partner didn't circumcise their son

""The social argument 'I want my son to look like me,"" the Seattle-based Savage says on his cellphone. ""My son and I don't compare dicks....A circumcised penis doesn't obviate the need for showering and bathing. My son knows when he's in the shower that he has to wash his legs and feet and has to roll back his foreskin and wash in, around, and underneath. If my six-year-old can do it, a 26-year-old can do it.

I have, with someone whose … scent I find attractive (aside: scent is a major component of attraction in general for me, and I’m fully convinced this is because we use scent to determine genetic compatibility. I’m also blood type B, and the only long–term same–sex friendship I’ve ever made was with someone who is also B. Type B being the rarest, I think this is a major reason why attraction is as rare as it is for me: fewer people are genetically compatible). I believe I was confused in almost all my past relationships: the need, the craving, the desire—it wasn’t emotional passion and it wasn’t (with somewhat rare exceptions) sex; it was this. I used to maneuver into watching movies that I didn’t give a damn about, just because I knew it would be an excuse for us to be close

I’ve never been abused or abandoned, I recoil and it actually makes me angry. And I should clarify that I quite literally get a very vivid sort of high. As someone who has done large doses of LSD and psilocybin, and plenty of cannabis sativa, I know what does and doesn’t deserve to be called a “high.” This really has been on par with some of my most intense psychedelic experiences; and it is in fact so strong that I’ve genuinely wondered if something like pheromone addiction might exist. It’s arousing, but (usually) doesn’t make me want sex; it just interrupts the trance, and then at climax the high basically ends. I wrote this (http://tinyurl.com/vangoghmalady) after a particularly vivid experience, which essentially involved no more than us looking in each others eyes for a prolonged period. I remember one of the only times one of my exes didn’t lay next to me when we sat to watch a movie: she thought nothing of it, I felt this deep overwhelming sinking feeling, ‘how the fuck do I get her back next to me!?’ I bore it because I couldn’t figure out any nondesperate way, I assumed that everyone else was like this

At first, and he spoke about ideas such as matriarchy and submission to females as valid, real world ideas, not just fetishes. Maybe I'm ignorant, but as I said, I kept things like female dominance in the fetish realm and never analyzed them too seriously.

But Marston had very interesting ideals. He talked about how men naturally craved for a mother figure their entire lives. Even if they seemed to become dominant towards women as they got older, and rational than men, and if they ruled society, war and crime would be almost nonexistent. He basically stated that men needed a mature, cool-headed female presence to submit to in order to overcome their natural tendency towards unruly and anarchic behavior. He even admitted that his writings in Wonder Woman were pretty much propaganda for matriarchies, and he took Wonder Woman's overwhelming popularity as partial proof of his theories.

Highlights of my thinking from there:

The term ""porn"" itself seems to me to have meaning only the context of anti-sex+ attitudes

Something created for the specific intention of arousing lust

To me, but no one person or group IMO should have the authority to place such a derogatory label on any given work.

What tends to bug me is the argument that a 15 year old girl can't consent to sex.  I find the logic superfluous.  Now

In my opinion, then why is a law that makes sex illegal by virtue of that age necessary?  To be quite honest, I think that what I'm proposing actually makes anti-sexual assault and anti-rape laws stronger.  By replacing the age of consent with a law like I'm suggesting, you're extending the same protections we currently provide minors to *all* people of limited autonomy.
