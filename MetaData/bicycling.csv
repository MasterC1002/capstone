My girlfriend was hit and killed by a truck yesterday in Denver. She was 23 years old. She just moved out there from our apartment in Brooklyn. I was going to move out there with her after Christmas. I though I was going to marry this girl

I don't know if any of you live in Denver

My girlfriend and I biked everywhere. Not just for ourselves but for everyone around us. For a better world, and environmental awareness. The world needs more people like her, not less. 

If you think you can help me in any way

Thanks.

Below is the verbatim crash report given to her husband David Morgan:

*THE CYCLIST WAS WEST BOUND ON MS50 NEAR THE TRULOVE LOOP INTERSECTION.  V1 WAS WEST BOUND ON MS50 APPROACHING THE CYCLIST FROM THE REAR.  THE FRONT OF V1 COLLIDED WITH THE REAR OF THE BICYCLE.  THE IMPACT THREW THE CYCLIST INTO THE AIR BEFORE LANDING ON THE HOOD OF V1 AND ONTO THE WINDSHIELD.  V1 CONTINUED FOR A FEW FEET BEFORE COMING TO A STOP.  THE CYCLIST WAS THEN THROWN TO THE ASPHALT WHEN V1 STOPPED.  THE DRIVER OF V1 EXITED THE VEHICLE AND OBSERVED THE CYCLIST WHILE TALKING ON THE PHONE.  D1 THEN REENTERED HER VEHICLE AND RAN THE CYCLIST OVER AGAIN BEFORE BEING FORCED FROM HER VEHICLE BY WITNESSES.  V1 CAME TO FINAL REST FACING WEST IN THE WEST BOUND LANE ON MS 50 JUST METERS WEST OF THE TRULOVE LOOP INTERSECTION.  THE CYCLIST CAME TO FINAL REST NEAR THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE OF V1.*

Both bikes are extremely rare in the states (there are fewer than 100 of those Dogma XC's and I'd bet less than 2 or 3 dozen of the Marcelos) so if you're in SoCal or AZ and see either one in the near future

First off

About a mile or so in

Further up I can see tents and things so I keep riding. I feel as though somethings wrong but I haven't put it all together yet.

Just then a pack of about 10-12 riders blows past me followed by a scooter.

Scooter guy slows down a bit

So I thank him and look back.

OMFG I am in the middle of a damn race. I see a huge pack coming. I panic. I swerve into the middle (center island) of the road and the pack (maybe 150-200 people

So I am in the center island and I just want to GTFO. Any sane man might have just stayed behind the pack and continued on

I make a decision that seemed logical for the .005 seconds my brain considered it. My embarrassment made me rush. So what did I do? I go to the other side of the road and head back as fast as I can towards the barrier.

[ Edit Clarification: The course was a long straight road that had a east bound and west bound side and u turns at either end. The island was in the middle. I started going east bound (with race traffic) when I switched sides I was now going west bound. Meanwhile the race that was going east bound was going to u turn and come west bound behind me on my side. I was not riding against traffic at any time.]

As some of you may have realized

I was almost at the barricade

I see the  turn up ahead (at the barricades) and everyone in the lead pack is starting to veer to the right side to prepare for the left U  turn. I realize I need to get out of the fucking way for the main pack but I don't have time. 

Before I realize whats up

Every other guys that passed me seemed to yell at me ""asshole!"" ""get off the course!""

All I could think was do not stop, hold your fucking line. Meanwhile I'm like a stone in a river with water (bikes) flowing all around me. Then my fear gets worse as I realize I need to be far right to get off the course. If anyone is to my immediate right at the barricade I will have to turn with the pack!

Luckily I got far right and manage to squeeze out of the barricade area as they all made the turn behind me. I was still in the somewhere in the middle of the pack by the time I got out. 

No one told me what was going on. There were no signs that said anything like ""Road Closed For Bike races"" or similar. Had I approached from the other direction it would have been a different story as there were vendor tents and registration at that end. I swear I felt like a fool but yet there was something humorous about it too.

So if any of you were witness to this

Edit: I was riding a trek fx 7.1 wearing a bright orange T shirt and a black backpack for you internet slueths.

1) I live in a fairly urban area in Vancouver

2) I don't know what type of bike to get. I've done a bit of research, so my question here is - while it would probably be easier to learn to ride on a mountain bike, would it be that much more difficult trying to learn for the first time on a road-ish bike?

3) Finding a helmet could be tricky, and places in Vancouver to find them?

I hear this sort of thing a lot from drivers, and filed an official complaint with the BPD. 

I was worried about harassment

A district wide email blast was also sent out, ""Failure of vehicle driver to pass safely at a distance of at least 3 feet when overtaking a (bicycle, EPAMD, motor scooter). The fine is $80.00 and 1 point, and $120.00 and 3 points when the violation contributed to an accident.)

So as I lay here in the hospital having just experienced my first chest tube insertion from my collapsed lung, and it completely surprised me that our arms would make any contact. They should not have, in fact, unless you intentionally meant for it to happen. Then after the fact, why did you keep going? I flipped, my ribs broken in 16 places and 6 fractures in my spine and you just went on like nothing happened. As I struggled to get a single breath my only question for the EMT was to ask how you were, and he said you were gone. Didn't even stop. I don't understand your apparent lack of  humanity and it surprises me that you could be so cold and indifferent to a complete stranger who you directly injured. It didn't even occur to me until last night as I replayed the event over and over in my mind that what happened was an outright assault on your part. Now I feel like a naive fool for that

So pain and suffering aside I just like to let you know how your actions go to affect a lot more. I'm stuck in this hospital bed for at least another two days. I expect my final bill will be about about thirty thousand

Two friends of mine encouraged my wife and I to get into cycling. A local used bike shop built up a mid-90s Trek 930 for me basically taking the steel frame and adding parts to make it into a comfort bike.  We also just purchased a Giant comfort bike for my wife. 

Today was my third time on the bike and the first time I wasn't scared out of my mind that I was going to hurt myself. The first two times were only a couple of miles as got used to riding a bike again after 20 years. The ride today was on a rails-to-trails path in my city. 

I'm buzzed on endorphins right now and can't wait to take the bike out again this afternoon. Once getting over my initial mini-panic attacks my only problem is that my wrists hurt a lot after 20-30 minutes so I may need to raise up my handlebars.

I had been riding my dad's old Specialized Allez around for a year or so, and the sudden increase in force just snapped it through.  As it was aluminum, and old, I decided not to repair it and obtain a new frame.

I managed to get a, and it would have worked but I decided I wanted to take opportunity to follow through on an art project that I had been thinking about for a while.  The [Sharpie Lamborghini](https://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1_____enUS408US408&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=794&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w_fGTtW4BJHRiAL10KTWDw&amp;ved=0CD4QvwUoAQ&amp;q=sharpie+lamborghini&amp;spell=1) was my main source of inspiration.

I used a paint remover in combination with a paint scraper to remove all the paint, doing a wet sand where there had been a paint streak or buildup.  I did the same with 3 layers of black matte.

I then made it into a community art project, it was exclusively handled with latex gloves.  I then used an entire can of clear coat.

I used all the same components from the previous bike, and maintenance.  I was extremely happy with the results, it is too infrequent that we have an idea, and follow it through to fruition.  Thanks for taking the time to look at the pictures, and I apologize for the initial phone pictures.

But  I know some of the calls he got were from here because his ADA posted a response [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/i6pcr/my_friend_was_hit_from_behind_while_riding_her/c21gbza).

We're not asking the ADA to skirt the laws to find the woman guilty.  We just want her to go before a jury and let them decide based on the facts.  He previously said there was nothing she could be charged with

I had to stop at a light in my neighborhood (Washington Heights


We were both going the same direction so we rode together

After about 15 miles

He told me that delivering pizzas is the best job for him because he gets paid to ride a heavy mountain bike up steep hills and sprint up apartment building stairs on foot all day to work out his legs. When he told me he was doing all this to become a professional racer as to provide for his mother

I had a glimmer in my eye

We came to the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge and I was still hurting after a couple blocks of walking rest. We got back on our bikes and clipped in. He gave me a sly grin and asked

He jumped on the pedals and took off like a rocket up the bridge saying something like ""See you soon!"" I tried my hardest to keep up with him.

After watching the mens Olympic RR on Saturday, I had a good week on the bike so far but I was behind on my miles.

I'm in my kit and I sit down to eat

Then The guy at the table next to me finishes his phone conversation and then asks me how far I'm going today. I probably was a little too verbose saying I'm not sure

He asks if I like my bike

He mentions he bought a bike but he never could get into it for one reason or another. I sympathize, its not bad. He says he enjoys taking his motorcycle out to the track.

Yatta yatta yatta, don't have room and my wife would kill me (I just sold 3 bikes), I just booked our honeymoon on credit. I'm picturing an old Allez or a Schwinn from Target. But I don't even bother to ask at this point.

He nods and lightly asks

I chuckle again and ask why not just put it on Craigslist

You sure? It's a good bike, but I think I really don't want a litespeed or a TT bike (I think to myself). We both kind of laugh a nervous stalemate laugh. Oh well, he wraps up his trash and walks out, have a good one we say.

He grabs his dry cleaning next door and pulls away

I roll up to his truck because he's waiting to turn and he rolls the window down.

""I just live two blocks that way (the direction I'm headed). 1234 whatever street. Make a left. Just come by and take a look

So I take the bait. I'm in a nice neighborhood in the suburbs of Seattle, but his house is behind his neighbors. On a hill. Looking out towards the lake.

This is a bad idea. My wife would never do something like this, I've been jumped and fought back in Chicago, I've had people swerve at tail gate me as I ride, in Oakland. But I've seen American Psycho. So again, I'm in my kit and I'm rolling down this guys driveway with somewhat tall shrubs lining it creating real privacy.

He pulls into his *very* clean garage with those giant puzzle piece like floor panels made out of some polymer. I notice right away theres a very nice not-street-legal Ducati 1098 (slicks, no mirrors) in the back and a modest arcade room. Ok this guy is serious but I'm still watching for signs that its a trap. 

He says hey and hang on a minute. I'm standing there in my kit still

Then he pops back to the garage with this black and red bike with flat tires. It's got white handlebar tape and its just about my size but the seat is quite a bit lower as he's 4 or 5"" shorter than me. It's brand new (well

I notice within an instant, but they're freaking Dura-Ace. This instant where I'm processing what I'm seeing, where I am, what this means and what I'm going to say takes less than a second and feels longer than the entire ride I was on up until this point. I don't even know the guys name and he's telling me I can *have* this bike.

http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7249/7677458074_91a0c0ae4f_b.jpg

Well here it is in my apartment. No strings. Theres no messy divorce he's going through (I really did ask). I didn't have to give him a BJ or give up my cornhole or any sort of man on man bodily fluid swap. No money involved. The dudes just doing really well for himself and wanted the bike to go to someone who'd really use it and we were in the right place at the right time. Yatta yatta yatta...He drops the bike off

I decided I want to get a little healthier because I never exercise and frankly I don't like exercise. But I used to love riding. When I was a kid I could ride for hours and hours. 

So I just got a bike. I rode for a half hour on a bike trail against the wind. I'm exhausted. And I don't feel good. My body feels like jello. But it was fun. I think the ""feel good after working out"" thing comes when you're in shape. And I'm determined to get that feeling of exhilaration back for riding. You guys inspire me.

I realize that's a tough sell for most people.   My commute is 5 miles each way.   I tried to bike every day of the week to start and that was too much, only enough room for maybe 12 cars, and all surrounding street parking is permit only), but they still drive.   It shouldn't be a tough sell - it's fun, it gets you exercise, it costs a *ton* less than driving, and you never have to worry about traffic.   It's so much fun that, I began looking for longer routes just so I could ride a bit more.   Now I regularly take a longer route up over San Vicente
 
Despite that, borrow, or buy a cheap used bike and just try for a week.   If not commuting, then just try riding around town, on the streets, for a few days.   It's good to experience the road in someone else's shoes - I find that a lot of things I've done while driving around cyclists before that I felt were completely innocuous are actually pretty harrowing for the guy on the bike.   I hear my friends complain about cyclists blocking the lane really often, and none of them realize that we don't do it to be jerks, please read up on what a ""right hook"" is
 
So what have I learned in the past year?
 
It's great exercise.   I have jeans that I couldn't button at the beginning of this past year, it does make you sweaty, which sometimes sucks when you show up to work.   The idea that ""it never gets any easier, you just get faster"" definitely applies to me, I've nearly halved the time that it takes me to get to work, so the sweating hasn't stopped.   The nice thing is, though
 
It's made me a calmer person.   I don't get as aggravated as easily as I used to, along with getting a good dose of serious exercise a couple of times a day.   Now, when I do, it's just one of those things, there's traffic.   I don't feel like it's something I deal with every single day.   Which leads to...
 
I don't have to worry about traffic reports anymore.   It doesn't matter if Obama is visiting town, and it's a nightmare.   Driving up it is this constant battle between trying not to block intersections combined with having to assert yourself to be able to make it through the intersection at all.   I don't have to worry about that anymore.   Carmageddon?   Still making it home in 20-25 minutes.
 
You actually get to enjoy your neighborhood.   You learn more about it - I had no idea that Ohio actually goes uphill as you head east...it's actually a pretty decent climb.   You learn little side streets that now I use when I do have to drive, like the parrots I heard the other day by the VA hospital in Westwood, then I got to watch them fly away, bursts of green on the blue sky, while my fellow commuters couldn't.
 
It's not as scary as you think it is.   For the most part, are pretty good about sharing the road.   It's rare that I've been honked at, buzzed, or tailgated, though those things have happened.   Just take some time to go through some safety guides online, and follow their advice.   Stop at stop signs and red lights (I wish more of my fellow riders would do this, especially the stop sign thing).   Signal your movements, I find.   When they don't
 
Rent, and spent a decent amount on one.   Turns out, I had no idea what I wanted and bought another one a few months later.   I love that second bike, and am looking to sell the first one.   Any takers?   Also, don't buy your bikes from Performance.   Just don't.   Or from a big box store like Target, Walmart, or a sporting goods store (except REI, though they're not amazing either).   They will be much cheaper
 
I'd list more negatives, and sometimes you're tired - damn tired.   However, I've never dreaded my commute.   I've thought ""This commute is going to be hard"", but never ""This commute is going to suck.""   I look forward to my commute every day, even a year on.   I looked back through some of my tracked rides, and I remember how hard that first ride was when I bought the bike - 2 miles around Westwood.   My legs were tired and I was breathing hard.   Now, both my wife and I are planning on doing 50 miles at the LA River Ride, or at least very nearly done.
 
I honestly can't recommend it enough.   A year in and I'm hooked.   Of course,False,self,t5_2qi0s,False,,us,t3_ukj12

Rough description/translation:

*Jens Voigt, finished his last bottle of water. He saw a young child on the side of the road and decided to roll the bottle towards him. However a man pushed the kid aside and took the bottle for himself. Jens stopped, turned around, and biked back down the hill to confront the man.  Under pressure from Jens and the rest of the crowd, he gave the bottle to the young boy. This prompted one of the biggest cheers of the day.*

**Actually**, put them in my back pocket. Whenever you have drivers not sharing the road, or passing ridiculously close to you, throw that on his car, at the intersection. It's a magnet, so no need to carefully place it; it'll just stick without damaging the vehicle. I took a generic ""fake"" scratch design, but would like to make some more ""subliminal"" that aren't associated with fake stickers. They'd be pretty mad
