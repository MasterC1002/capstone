*Music*

This is a big concern to almost everyone switching from iOS to android. There are a few different ways you can get all of your iTunes music onto your android:

1. Plug your phone into your computer via USB and drag your iTunes music folder into the phone or the SD card. When that’s done, and all your music will be there. 

2. Use Google’s music service. Get Google’s [Music Manager](http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1229970) and upload your iTunes folder and any other mp3 folders you may have. Get the Google Play Music app on your phone and you can 1. stream your iTunes music from the cloud 2. download your iTunes music to your phone via Google Music.

3. Use Doubletwist player. I don’t have any experience using doubletwist, podcasts, videos, etc. over your wifi network.  

*Group Texting and iMessage*

Group text messages work in the newest version of android (4.2), however, is locked away by apple, so no one can build an android client for it. So the short answer is: group texting works, iMessage doesn’t.

*Siri*

Google introduced Google Now in android 4.1. It's a lot like Siri in that you speak into your phone and it responds. You can ask it for the weather, just like siri. You can also use it to give you phone commands like ""open Temple Run"" or ""set an alarm for 5:30 AM."" The coolest thing about Google Now, however, is its card system. I'll use the weather card as an example. When you open up Google Now, it automatically brings up a [card with the current weather and a 5 day forecast](http://i.imgur.com/Jpj3i.jpg) for your location, without you even asking for it.  [Here's a Google Now vs. Siri video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_pclCFpjgw).

*Facetime*

The best two alternatives to facetime are Skype and Google+ Hangouts. Skype is a free video-calling service that runs through a Skype account. Google+ hangouts are run through your google account and are great for video-calling with multiple people at the same time. President Obama uses them for his ""fireside chats"". 

*Other apps*

There will usually be an android version of any iOS app you want in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store). If not

I have a lot of questions ranging from lazy and stupid to complicated.
I'm hoping one of you lots is kind (and bored at work) enough to go through these and answer them.  I know I can look a lot of these up, here goes.


* Can I not change music with the headphones that came with the phone?  I want to go to the next song
* Kind of confused about syncing with my gmail account...under account and sync, so I can use the Titanium back up.  Is there even a better option to do that, maybe without rooting it?
* Is there any way to modify what shows up on my notification bar?  I'm guessing there are ways if I root my phone, can I get weather to show up on the pull down notification bar?  And to make the full circle, is there any way I can have some music control show up there too?
* This might not have an answer...my fat palm sometimes squeezes over and hits the soft keys when I use it with one hand.  Any solution for that...?  I guess I can hit the gym....or play more smash bros to work out my hands?  


Maybe I'll end it here.  Any feedback/answer would be much appreciated.


**edit**  Oh man!  I love you guys.  I must say, I now have another lingering question.  

* Whenever I try to install Google music manager, it seems to freeze and it says ""not responding.""

Tried to look it up, but can't find info on this anywhere...so I turn to you again, reddit.
* Can I have a badge on the Gmail app icon

According to all your suggestions it looks like there was some sort of mis-communication with the carrier or there is a corrupted message database or something else that is technical that I don't understand fully. It has never happened before and I am told not to worry unless it happens again.

I'm a long time HTC user EVO &gt; EVO 3D &gt; EVO 4G LTE. Played around with the One and it kind of diminished my excitement about the device. The design is top notch but I don't feel that makes up for BlinkFeed, lack of two-stage camera button (I use that a lot), Kick stand (negligable but I'm one of the few that use it often), changes to face buttons (again, I used the menu key often, anything to free up screen real estate), among other things. The One felt like a progression towards Apple's design philosophy. A ""streamlining"" of sorts that seems to limit the phone's ability in favor of features they feel we need and don't need.  Also

Samsung's device is starting to look more interesting to me. While I've never been a fan of Samsung's designs and while I feel that their overall aesthetic is cheap (fonts

I'm looking for experiences of people who used to have HTC phones and made the switch to a Galaxy or a Note as I am currently leaning towards the S4.

This page was blank and loaded no content. I have never had this happen on any rom on any of my devices. Play store reviews of SMS Backup &amp; Restore make no mention of any similar occurrences and google search of ""android teenspartysluts"" provides no relevant results. I have two questions: 

1) This was the first time Browser was opened on my phone. Was the google login dialogue a result of that

2) How can I find out the cause of this behaviour so that if I re-wipe and try again I don't re-install the offending app?

Hey I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Nexus to replace my slow, but what else could I do with it?  

Well that got me thinking.  I removed ""Phone.apk"" and put the droid into Airplane mod.  Mind you I was running some outdated version of CM7 2.3.7 with a custom kernel I forget.  I removed all the pointless ""bloatware"" I had amounted over the past few years, and I think there could be a better solution.  

I am traveling overseas beginning early feb, I can download tons of emus and bring along a wiimote to play classic NES games.  This device has a second life.  This is what I'm trying to say.  To throw this device into a desk to die a slow and abysmal death of obsolescence is a waste! 

**STATEMENT**

As the droid 1 becomes a non-network commissioned phone

An Android Retired Device Commissioned OS build would be a hit with the future users, long lasting MP3 battery life, and pocket sized gaming platform with solid battery life. Retired phones, specifically Droid 1 can do this! I think it would be awesome, and tons of people who don't even realize it will love this device.  The battery life I get with this phone (now that I am in Airplane mode) is amazing! (4 days today).

1313344479.0,jil4g,Please read: Add and Update your own flair through the /r/AndroidQuestions automated process.,deodrus,21,3,16,"Hey everyone

We have implemented a system whereby all /r/AndroidQuestions readers can now add, but more importantly, it allows other readers to help you with device-specific or carrier-specific problems.

*Follow this method below

**Here is how it works:**

1. [**Send a message to BigFriendlyRobot**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=BigFriendlyRobot&amp;message=DeviceName

2. In the message body, WindMobile*

3. Press SEND

Note: Developers are also allowed to change their flairs (see Rules below). Your icons will remain. Readers who want to get a developer-icon next to their flair
***

Since the flairs can be misused for spam (or misused as a facebook-status)

**Rules Regarding Automated Flairs**

1. If you are a non-developer

2. If you have multiple Android devices

3. If you are a developer

4. Developers are also allowed to mention their Android-Device info

5. No URLs are allowed in your flair. Top-level domain is allowed (example.com)

6. Your flair must be of reasonable length (40 characters is the maximum limit).

7. Please don't type your flair text as ALL CAPS.

8. Please don't swear in your flair.

***

**The Flair Warning System (Three Strike Ban)**

There might be a small few, a transparent three-strike ban has been implemented.

**Here is how it works:**

1. If a reader disregards the rules of the subreddit (but the act is not a banworthy offense)

2. Succeeding offenses will result in [2] and [3] tags. On the third-strike

2. A reader with [1] or [2] next to their flair will lose their automated flair-changing privileges (the bot will refuse to honor the flair-change request and will inform them through a reply). Only a moderator may change that reader's flair

3. Note: You can [appeal your case to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Android&amp;message=Please+reconsider+my+flair+strike+because+...&amp;subject=Flair+Strike+Appeal) to get your strike erased.

**These offenses will earn you a warning:**

* Grievous misuse of flair.

* Hateful comments towards other users.

* Harmful trolling of the subreddit/users.

* Providing links to pirated material.

* Gray areas when considering spam bans.

***

This new flair system will allow readers to see who's who in the comments, and also makes spammers more visible.

If you have any suggestions or criticisms for improving on the proposed model

Thanks for all of your suggestions! My phone* works perfectly now

First thing I ended up doing was downloading a wakelock detector to see if anything was waking up my phone constantly. The only thing that was was 2x battery. An app that turns your entire networking on/off every 15 minutes. So although it was waking the phone up

Then

Afterwards i did one final test. I (again) charged my phone up fully

So as some of you suggested

**92%**

So. What can i gather from all this? The average discharge rate of a HTC One X is about %0.5-1 an hour on idle, turn off networking) but if your phone is still horrible then chances are the battery is fucked

1372074676.0,1gyp66,I got an android phone that I want to set up for my son's games. Need help with a few things!,davidsmeaton,20,5,5,"For starters

So here's the situation

[edit 1: I found this page which seems to confirm that it's a Pantech](http://www.handsetdetection.com/properties/vendormodel/Pantech/IM-A710K)

My son is 16 months and he already knows how to unlock the phone and open his games apps. I want to set the phone up so that he can play with it

1. I need to root it - I tried using gingerbreak (followed the instructions carefully) but it didn't work. The phone got stuck in a ""rooting"" screen for 2 hours before I gave up and rebooted. When I try to use gingerbreak the SD card unmounts

I don't have a usb cable

Post-root (if I can figure the root method out)

1. Disable emergency call (or disable the phone functions entirely). My son plays with buttons and sometimes presses the emergency call button. Twice it's gone through to a real person before I've realised what he's done. I've removed the SIM card already (and only enable wifi when I am trying to download root apks) but emergency call still goes through.

2. Remove all the ridiculous apps. Korean phones come with about 5 pages of unremovable apps. Most are complete crap! I'd like to get rid of as much as I can to clear up memory and not have them running (or able to be started).

3. Maximise the phone's speed. It does get sluggish because of all the background tasks that are running (many of which I don't need). So I would like to get rid of all unnecessary tasks which are always on. That includes stuff like contacts, so I don't care about dumping apps/processes which I don't immediately need.

Aside from kid's games

***

I know that's a lot ... I'd be happy with just rooting for now and working on the other stuff later. I have done a large amount of reading and I haven't been able to figure out the root issue. I'm sure once it's rooted there's ways I can get the other stuff done.

Apologies for the wall of text. I appreciate your help guys!

I would be prepared to unlock bootloader or frankly anything so I could use the phone. On eBay there are Droid Razr's that are unlocked..

Chrome locks up when I try to load web pages. Google Play Store and Music seem to just stop altogether randomly. My phone has been moving slowly recently

This gives me a fresh start, the same way I do my computer, but Android hides data from me. I don't necessarily want to root my phone because I've heard all kinds of horror stories about bad ROMs and phones that just don't want to accept the new ROMs.

The main things I use my phone for are calls, maps, music, podcasts, and some social stuff like fb/twitter. My iPhone feels stale. I hate having to sync to one computer. I hate dealing with iTunes at all. The podcast app constantly loses my spot when resuming a stream. Safari and the stock email app on iPhone are also dull. 

My questions about HTC One/Android in general...

1. Does the device basically act like a USB drive when plugged into a computer? As in I can open it up and drag and drop anything on it.

2. Could I be at home on a PC, and then go to work and plug it into a Mac and drag more music on it without it erasing anything or doing some sync? With iTunes this would erase my music I put onto it at home because it's not also on my work computer. 

3. I know there are android podcast apps, streaming, etc?

4. Does anyone else here run an iPad and an Android phone? Is it confusing, etc to switch between the 2 systems?

5. Other than the openess of Android in general, it's fast, it's easy, it's foolproof, most apps release first for iPhone, etc.

I followed video tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/user/nexus7root. If anyone can point me in the right direction I would be tremendously grateful. School starts in less then 2 days and I want to have my lovely apps back. Thanks!

I've had my SGS2 for nearly a year now and it's seen some rough times. Most recently it decided that it would be finicky with my chargers

* Performing a reset on the phone caused the battery to immediately drain to ~6%

* The device would randomly say the voltage was too high or that the battery was too hot to continue charging. Upon touching the device you would not assume it was that hot.

The other day the HTC charger stopped working and I had to play around with it to find a way to get it to charge. I would push the plug in, but it charged slowly and would often randomly stop. Also, sometimes it would appear to be charging but the battery would stay at 0%.

Help me please before I pull out my hair!,Teeklin,10,0,10,"I work for a home health company and the head administrative nurse for our hospice division has a company phone - a Samsung Galaxy S2.  For some unknown reason

I used the S2 for a long time, or composing an e-mail or text, or even just attempting to turn the phone on using the button in the upper right and the screen will go/stay black.  It will be completely unresponsive to pressing any buttons at all for between 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and then you'll hit the power button and it will boot back up with the Samsung/Sprint splash screens and work fine again for a while.

She is on call constantly and literally dealing with life or death issues and is now forced to set an alarm at night every hour just so she can wake up and make sure that her phone hasn't shut itself off and this is getting ridiculous.

Here's the kicker...this is the second phone that has done this, so I called Sprint and they sent out a replacement phone with yet another new battery in it.  Even with a BRAND NEW PHONE AND BATTERY this still kept happening, so I took it up to the Sprint store and they tested the battery and said that it was failing and had ""bloating"" so they ordered another battery for it and upon getting it back to the office and putting that brand new battery in the phone did it within 30 minutes.

I was the PR Director for Occupy Portland, and generally get information they shouldn't have.

So I searched Google Play for an app for protesters

So

- Create a profile, and ""role"" (self defined)
- Create a protest
- The protest has a live ""wall"" that anyone can comment on and post pictures/video to
- Content can be removed from the wall if 2/3 of active users mark it for removal
- Content can be hidden from the wall display on an individual basis
- Inside a protest, and expirations (i.e. after their expiration, the event is archived)
- Inside a protest you can also create a channel, password controls, invitations, and current status of everyone in the channel (status set by the user)
- You can lock the app by shaking your phone (its an option that can be toggled) or other quick
- You can tie it to your email, etc. that can be triggered when you submit something
- A copy of the legal information relevant to protesting for your current jurisdiction (yes, and yes it means that I'll have to maintain a list of supported countries/locales)
- Recruiting and inviting protesters, a web page, twitter, facebook
- A map showing current activities and reports of police/official activity
- Password screen allows you to type in (or more likely, facebook, distribution plan, etc. letting them know that you've been detained; this allows you to let other people know that you have been detained by giving a false password (that fakes access)

So... what exactly am I getting myself into here? What do you think of an app like this? Some of the things in Protest4 I was already thinking about

I know what this kind of rough scope means as a web developer, and this is what I see (I actually think this will be more useful for protests in non-US jurisdictions for a variety of reasons).

My friend is in Korea these days and he says he has found a pretty good phone for pretty much free with amazing specs. I already have an HTC One X and didn't think twice about it but out of curiosity I researched it.

This is the phone :

**Pantech Vega Racer 2 IM-A830L**

Specs on GSMarena : 

http://www.gsmarena.com/pantech_vega_racer_2_im_a830l-4738.php

Specs on Android.com 

http://www.android.com/devices/detail/sky-vega-racer2-im-a830l

Now what I found the most weird thing about this phone was just how cheap and powerful it was. After some researching I found these things about it :

- This company is the second most sold in Korea after Samsung and in front of LG.

- This phone is cheap because of Korean currency value being so low

- In the benchmark tests

- It is pretty well known in those regions

- Its battery life is claimed better than my phone too

- The bloatware by Pantech is pretty good too

I found a 30 minute video of someone going over it :

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMX6dyDWVs

It's advertisements and website also seem to be top notch and the company has been making phones since 1991/92 and I think they also sell them in the US (I'm in UK).

**My questions are these :**

- Should I buy this phone? I do need a second phone and this is pretty cheap and I'll never find a phone with the same specs for this price.

- If I buy this phone can I remove everything from it and change it to a custom ICS installation without any bloatware that comes with it? Like Pantech's own personalized widgets

- My friend has held the phone and says it is very smooth and solid, why is this so cheap then? Why does it have a 1.5Ghz dual core for so cheap?

I've been flashing CM, and started experiencing a slew of issues. Many times, an error saying Youtube, or Google Voice, or camera has stopped working would pop up. Also, when I would lock the phone, the phone would sometimes wake up immediately after

I began to think this was due to the rom being an unstable nightly, the phone's backlight will flash and other times, the phone will reboot. Sometimes the lock button is just unresponsive. 

I've tried flashing the stable mod multiple times and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. My normal process is:

1) factory reset 
2) wipe cache 
3) wipe dalvik 
4) install CM 10.0.0 
5) install the appropriate gapps 
6) reboot 
7) set up google account 
8) test lock button

Any ideas?

I love flashing roms, but the One X seems like a beast in specs, and I don't know if I'm sold on super amoled. 

I checked XDA developers and the one x is rooted, I'll give the new version a try but I'll most likely be throwing AOSP or AOKP on the One X straight away.


The way I see it, screen looks beautiful, but I really really love the Nexus and the whole idea of the Nexus, I'm really torn here, trying to weigh up the pros and cons.

Pros of the Nexus

* Pure Android

* Always wanted a nexus!
* Removable battery(As long as I can get at least 12 hours I wont need to remove the battery)
* Great developer support

Cons of the Nexus

* Specs are kinda outdated
* Knowing a new nexus will be out in a few months is really killing me and I feel I'll regret buying the Nexus right now
* The build quality on the thing just doesn't seem very ""high end""
* The camera seems a little poor

Pros of the One X

* Specs are awesome and seem pretty future proof
* Really like the screen
* Has easy root and unlock
* Camera seems better
* Build quality and overall design looks better (to me)

Cons of the One X

* Non removable battery (Is this a big deal I don't know... I always pull the battery on my G2 when it crashes
* Bit more expensive (Tho I think it's justified)

I'm leaning towards the One X, it just feels like the wrong time to get a Nexus, with a new one just around the corner, buying it now ensures that I a)Don't get anything off the price because it's currently the latest model and b)Don't get the new Nexus because it isn't out yet. I know one person with a Nexus and one person with a One X, the One X looks a lot cooler to me, it's definitely better spec wise, the only thing left is developer support, and Nexus owners too

Alright

I went to Verizon and explained the issue to them. The rep told me that it was losing all data because I didn't have location services turned on, but it was fixed with a new SIM card. They gave me a new 4G SIM card.^2 I left, a little weary that they were just trying to get rid of me. I walked out of the store, sat down in my car, and looked at my phone. Signal dropped as soon as I turned the screen on. 

So, and was seen again pretty quickly. I showed the rep that I had the location services on as they had turned it on for me. While I was showing the location services status to the rep, the signal cut out again. I pointed it out to the rep and was taken back to the tech area again. They took my phone back in the back and left me standing there for about 10 minutes, just waiting. During this time, the rep walked out twice and got additional reps. Eventually they came back out and told me that there were a few things that might be able to help. They uninstalled Advanced Task Killer, explaining that it could be interfering with the 4G radio.^3* Then, they uninstalled a battery widget I had installed to tell me the % of battery I had left in the notification bar. I was told that this battery widget could cause my signal to drop randomly.

Is this legal, but we want a nice phone that works when we want it to.

We currently have a HTC Hero and love it and were looking at getting t he HTC LTE

Thank you for the advice.

However

    1. Low on app data space message appears erroneously.   
I've moved every app that I could over to the SD card, SD has over 2GB free, internal phone storage has 5.96GB free, and phone memory has 609MB free. 

    2. Gmail doesn't work at all.  
I had 3 accounts associated with it

    3. Notifications only work with SMS / MMS. 
    Nothing else notifies until reboot. Then it only notifies once.  
Wordfeud and Facebook don't notify at all anymore until a reboot.

* **Notifications**! - There's no system wide notification centre like there is in iOS (or maybe I just haven't found it?). At the moment I have widgetlocker set up with NiLS which is pretty buggy and ugly. I'd like to use the native lockscreen but that doesn't show notifications. StatusBar+ also manages some notifications while the device is unlocked but sometimes they fail to show and generally its unreliable. 

* **Lockscreen** - Kinda covered in the previous point. I'm using widget locker with a jellybean theme and I find it sometimes doesn't unlock properly. Also

* **Statusbar** - At the moment I am using StatusBar+ which allows a bit of customization but not really enough. In the statusbar I want battery percentage, 4G etc..) OR wifi icon. As well as dynamic icons such as silent/vibrate, new notifications, alarms set.

* **Shortcuts** - On iOS there was activator which was great for assigning tasks for long home button press

* **Multitasking** - I'm not a big fan of the current recent apps screen which appears on long home button hold. Only 2/3 apps are shown at a time and generally its very clunky to use. Is there an iOS like multitasking bar available?

I am comfortable with flashing new ROMs

* Having the track name and other ID3 tags displayed on the stereo display.

* Being able to answer calls through my stereo and have the audio play through the car

* No reliance on an actual data connection.  Once the route is sent to the phone the phone should download all of the relevant maps that'll be used on the trip and cache them on the phone
* Decent turn by turn navigation

Now the bonus wish list:

* Diverge routes from a point or points on a given trip route.  For example, less scenic but quicker etc.  So when you get to town X the app prompts you ""which route do you wish to take from here to get to your destination?""
* Easy to set POI or waypoints.  For example
* Fastest route from here button.  Anywhere on your route have a menu button that changes nav to quickest route to destination from here
* Breakdown a trip into ""legs"".  For example, leg 3 is return home via a different route than leg 1

For about a month now, but the lack of an official games library is what really bogs the phone down. However, earlier this week I went to a Verizon store that had the phone on display, played around with it, and really enjoyed my experience! The lack of a fleshed out games library on the official side of things isn't even that big of a worry of mine, as the majority of gaming I plan on doing is through emulators, which this phone is supposedly awesome at doing.

Another thing to note is that this is the first Android phone I will ever own. I was really considering waiting for the Galaxy S II, for instance, actually playable. In addition, the phone is only one cent through Newegg or Amazon Wireless if I renew my contract through Verizon (and I'm eligible for an upgrade), minus the cost of the data plan and such. I've heard good things about Amazon Wireless, and I understand the early activation fee and the potential issue of neither side taking responsibility for fixing my phone if I need to get it fixed, but are there any other catches I might be missing
