Keep in mind that I will link mostly to manufacturer or retail pages

I will admit that I am weak in certain areas, and gun hardware. If you have something to add, please feel free to post and I'll add it here. 

In the world of guns, take caution before buying. The world of firearms is a very specific place. You must be sure that your gift will be compatible with your shooter's needs, or that you're able to return your product if something is not a match. 

Alright

------------------

General: 

* You can never go wrong with ammo. Magazines (the ones for bullets) are also a good bet. Spend as much as you want here. 

* There are plenty of gun magazines (the ones with words) to subscribe to. Find one that suits your shooter's interests.

* Something from [Magpul](http://store.magpul.com/) or [EOtech.](http://www.eotech-inc.com/) Prices vary from $50 to thousands. 

* General hunting gear and apparel (boots

* You could arrange to have your shooter's gun colored, but it may be best to consult with your shooter beforehand. 

* For non-shooting gun enthusiasts

* Consider signing up for self-defense

---------------------------

Less than $60:

* Reactive (explosive) targets. Need I say more? [Tannerite](http://www.tannerite.com/) for a good time. 

* Gun cleaning supplies / kits. [Otis](http://www.otistec.com/Products/Hunting_and_Sporting.asp) is a good place to start. Notes: Try to avoid screw-together rods. They can damage the barrel rifling.

* Safety supplies. [Electronic muffs](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/671923/howard-leight-impact-sport-electronic-earmuffs-nrr-22-db-green) are good for light shooting. If you're playing with high caliber rounds

* [Magazine loaders.](http://www.midwayusa.com/find?userSearchQuery=magazine+loader)  

* Soft gun cases. Here are some from [Allen](http://allencompany.net/gun-cases.html).

* Zombie-hunting ammo. This is mostly a humorous item

* [Gun Slings.](http://www.cabelas.com/slings.shtml)

* [Snap Caps.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_cap) Make sure you get the correct caliber. 

* A [12 Gauge thermos.](http://www.buyholsters.com/product/Stansport-12-Gauge-Shotgun-Shell-Thermos)

* Books. Admittedly, but would be best suited for someone new to hunting. Regardless, it is an informative and enjoyable book.

---------------------------------

$60 to $150:

Keep in mind that pretty much everything listed above can be stepped up a notch. So

* [Bolt action tactical pen.](http://uncrate.com/stuff/bolt-action-tactical-pen/) Yup

* [Hard gun cases](http://www.midwayusa.com/find?dimensionids=10801) and [range bags.](http://www.midwayusa.com/find?userSearchQuery=range+bags) If you're artistic

* Custom engraved [pistol grips.](http://www.westvirginiawoodarts.com/Gungrips.html)

* In this price range

* Entry-level scopes and optics. Glass gets *very* expensive, varmint hunting, or target shooting. 

----------------------------

$150 to $300:

Now we're getting into the price range of new or used firearms. 

And again. Everything listed above can be improved. 

* Lower receiver custom engraving. This one might be difficult to pull off. You would have to either get the receiver from your gun owner

* Mosin Nagant. A cheap Russian surplus Mosin can be had for around $150. I'm not familiar with its ammo prices.

* Ruger 10/22, or simply have a good time at the range. A box of 550 rounds cost about $20 a month ago. That's a whole day of fun.
 

-----------------------

$300 to $600:

Now we're getting into the range of good scopes and other sights. Upgraded rails, or other hardware are in this price range, too. Additionally, $600 can buy a wide range of firearms. Leave a comment if you need a specific recommendation. 

Something


--------------------

More than $600:

The sky is the limit here. There are so many guns and other products on the market that it would be impossible to list them all. Use the above information to get an idea of what you want

--------------------


Keep checking. I'm updating every chance I get.

My boyfriend is the kind of guy who has everything. He's very into tech and gadgets and owns an iphone, an e-reader and every video game console you could imagine. He really enjoys gaming (both PC and console) but his interest in video games seems to come and go with every next big thing. He's the sort of guy who gets really excited about a new game, buys it, then only plays it 10 times or so. I've attempted to buy him new video games several times, and he goes out and buys it for himself. I'm also not into the whole video game thing, so I really struggle with picking games that he would be into. It seems like every game he mentions in conversation, he goes out and buys for himself. The only gift I've ever gotten him that he seems to enjoy is a computer mouse made for PC gaming. He is also very into writing, and I was planning on getting the heads of his snare drum replaced for this christmas, since he does have a rather nice beard but I'm unsure if he would use that type of product.

Now that Christmas has come upon us, it is not too early to think about next Christmas/Birthday. So in this thread I'd like people to post what you received as a gift this year.

Some simple rules:

* You must post your Age, 
* Mention hobbies you you feel willing.
* Do not post obvious gifts (Example: ""I got an iPad!"" or ""My SO gave me Diamond earrings!!')
* Really only post gifts that surprised you

***
One more thing. Please feel free to post any other gift problems you may have over the course of the year.

Country we live in: Switzerland

My sister's interests/hobbies:

* She likes to read fiction books and has in my opinion a terrible book taste (50 Shades Of Grey

*  She is also a big movie fan especially horror and comedy movies. 

* She likes Hawaii a lot (right now she is on vacation there again for the 4th time) and travel in general. 

* She really likes shopping (so when she is travelling she spends her time mostly with shopping). Especially clothes and jewelry.

* She likes fitness/jogging/wellness and has been jobbing as a fitness instructor for a while but not anymore.

* She wants to quit her boring job and go back to college to study tourism this Fall


Hope this is useful.

**Books/TV/Movies:**

* There are a lot of very informative and nice looking books on cars, or type of racing you can probably find something on it. I would suggest a nice history of [insert brand, model, racing series, etc here] coffee table book like [this one on Corvettes](http://www.amazon.com/Corvette-Sixty-Years-Randy-Leffingwell/dp/0760342318/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352954069&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=corvette+history) or [one on the history of Formula 1](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Formula-1-Race-Car/dp/0760337314/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352954094&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=f1+history+coffee+table+book).

*  Outside of Amazon another good source is [Motorbooks](http://www.motorbooks.com/)

*  If someone is a DIYer try getting them the Haynes or Chilton manual for their car. These are how-to repair manuals for specific models of cars and they're very useful. Most of them are on Amazon and they're usually around $20.

* Top Gear is a British auto enthusiast show. It's well done and incredibly popular. They mostly focus on newer European cars. [DVDs of their seasons](http://www.amazon.com/Top-Gear-18-Brian-Klein/dp/B007Q0JHYC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352954167&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=top+gear+dvd) would be great for someone into that kind of thing.

* Unfortunately I don't have the time to link all of these but a brief list of good car movies:

&gt; Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 version or 1974 version)

&gt; Fast and Furious series

&gt; The World's Fastest Indian (great movie)

&gt; Senna

&gt; Grand Prix (1966)

&gt; Le Mans (1971)

&gt; Two-Lane Blacktop (for older American car enthusiasts)

&gt; American Graffiti

&gt; The Gumball Rally and Cannonball Run

&gt; Tucker: The Man and his Dreams

&gt; Vanishing Point (1971)

&gt; The Doctor the Tornado and the Kentucky Kid

&gt; Long Way Down/Long Way Round (adventure motorcycle riding TV series)

**Memorabilia:**

* Again, keychains, etc can all be had for most manufacturers.

* If you're handy with needle and thread, and had a very nice custom gift. eBay will probably be your best source for patches.

* Vintage memorabilia is also a lot of fun

* Old license plates are fun. If the vehicle is old enough

* A hubcap makes a nice wall piece. For example

**Tools:**

* [Vice grips](http://www.amazon.com/Irwin-Original-Locking-Pliers-Contains/dp/B0015YJDNK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352952814&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=vice+grips)

TABLETS

[A STYLUS $5.99]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FFNL3W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006FFNL3W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – There are 2 of them that also write in ink here. It’s very handy and easy to keep with your tablet. This is a must have for all tablet-holders.

[Coby Kyros 7-inch $89.99]( http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=snewzbuttonco-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B0075W8C4M) – Let me start by saying that I would avoid buying tablets in this price range. There’s not a lot going for anything at this price, so you’re really limited. 

Under $200

KINDLES

[Standard Kindle $69.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HCCNJU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007HCCNJU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – **NOT A TABLET** The battery life is astonishing, you can ‘borrow’ a crapload of books for free. If the person you’re buying for would only want a kindle for reading, this one is the way to go. The paperwhite kindle is so close in price to the Kindle Fire that I’d just go with that one instead.

[Kindle Fire HD $199.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083PWAPW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0083PWAPW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – I bought my mother the original Kindle Fire last year and she adores it. She takes it everywhere. My mother is retired and takes herself, but it doesn’t have a camera for skype and stuff, and it only has an 8GB hard drive. The extra $40 makes the Kindle HD worth it.

 More TABLETS

[Asus Google Nexus 7 $282.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009X3UW2G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009X3UW2G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) -  Like the Kindle Fire, it’s really the best thing in small tablets. The only downside is that it’s a small tablet.

[Toshiba Excite $340.00](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007L5O3G4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007L5O3G4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) - I actually own a Toshiba Thrive, microSD inputs, and runs Ice Cream Sandwich. The only concern I have is that Toshiba is really slow with updating the operating system, so it may be a while before they put Jelly Bean on it. That said, it's a hell of a nice tablet and Toshiba does a great job with their construction.

[iPad starting at $465.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FRNKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FRNKG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – There are a bunch of options and prices

[Transformer Infinity $470.00](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008F4NL04/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008F4NL04&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) - At the beginning of the semester, an SD card reader, and... well, it's basically a notebook at that point. 

[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 $549.99]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007M506WS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007M506WS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – The Note is actually even more highly rated than the iPads, greatest tablet on the market. If you’re buying anything above this price, you’re probably looking to get 4G connection and stuff like that.

I find most of them on ebay and they're surprisingly affordable (most are well under $100)

A couple of things to watch out for:

1. Make sure you're buying an ORIGINAL autograph and not a preprinted or facsimile autograph. Ebay has categories for ""Original"" instead of ""Reprints"" but not everybody plays by the rules.
2. If possible
3. While shopping, so trust your gut! If you see that most Leonardo DiCaprio signed 8x10s are going for $125, the one that's selling for $30 probably has something wrong with it.

Get the photo, Matthew McConaughey actually had this photo in his hands!""

She's REALLY into zombie lore–probably the only reason I find the idea interesting. She talks about zombies and brings up scenarios all the time. She often goes out of her way to be ironic and eccentric.

* **16 year-old half-sister:** She's extremely outgoing and girly. She's a cheerleader at her school. She's also Mormon (because of her mom), ???

* **49 year-old stepdad:** He's extremely old-fashioned and also very athletic. He was on the track team through high school and he owns/operates a fitness program with my mom. He likes Dale Carnegie a lot. He gave me one of his books last year and told me that it changed his life when he was my age. He likes movies like A Perfect Storm, 300, etc.

* **40 year-old mom:** She's very... motherly... and also very athletic. She likes to go trail-running with my step-dad for fun. She also does photography/web-design for the business that she owns/operates with my step-dad. She has a very ""do-it-yourself"" mentality about her artistic hobbies and she's very proud of that fact. She's a die-hard organic food eater. She's read the entire Hunger Games series and loved the movie.

A few years ago I was told they were very competitive and liked fighting so I made sure to get them similar (but not identical) gifts. No clue if they are still like that. 

I am able to see my sister's likes on facebook and it's typical teenage girl stuff - Justin Bieber, especially football and cross country. 

I don't have any contact with their parents (and therefore them) which is why I don't know anything about them. It also means that I won't ever know if they even receive the gifts if I mail them so I don't want to spend more than $75 total. 

Do you suggest that I try to get them a generic gift in the $25 range and hope they like it? Or send gift cards? Another idea was to send something small so they'd have something to unwrap and then also send gift cards but I'm not sure what to get. Last year I sent them DC sweatshirts (where I live) so I probably shouldn't get DC stuff again. 

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

My Mum's 45th Birthday is coming up soon and would love some fresh ideas. Here is some info about her:

* She works as a caterer and makes lots of Indian food at home. 
* She does a lot of housework (we help of course!) 
* She recently started drinking green tea. I already bought her an infuser and she bought some sencha green tea along with a nice kettle. 
* She loves cooking traditional and western food and she has some cookbooks written in her native language. She cooks vegetarian food. 
* Jars, kitchen stuff and ornaments are cool too. 
* She likes not too sweet chocolates (but not dark chocolate)
* She likes flowers and indoor plants (which I have previously gifted) 
* She loves natural beauty products 
* She has long-ish hair
* She likes watching Indian soap operas (a lot)
* She doesn't put too much make up on except lipstick and nail polish
* She obviously likes simple garments (sadly I cannot spend more than $50)
* She wants to exercise more from her home

So I've gifted plants, kitchen stuff, clothes, garments, beauty products, spa treatments etc (but I want to avoid the spa/massage treatment stuff since she already does them herself). 

So

Thank you.

There are two pads which is just a strip of copper that acts as a resistor and get hot.. I'm sure you can make the heating pads yourself pretty easily but I Found these gloves because they had a switch that came with it.

Next step is to get the pads seperatley and buy the thing you want to be heated..( I originally used these as a pocket heater for my jacket in the winter..sewed the pads into the fabric lineing and had a battery pack in my pocket..  but I dont use that jacket anymore.

Personaly I'm using slippers so I'm going to rip the felt or cloth layer and insert the pads under them.. and wire it to a battery pack and switch somewhere on the top of the slipper or somewhere that doesnt look strange.

I feel that, cologne, alcohol, hunting/fishing/sporting equipment, and tools can only go so far. Last year, I thought I would shake things up for my stepfather a bit and get him a $20 remote controlled miniature helicopter. He has been employed in aerospace technology-related fields for most of his life and it's a career he's sincerely enjoyed. I remember he had a miniature remote controlled [HIMARS](http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/himars12.jpg) when he and my mother first met and how he thoroughly loved to annoy his dogs with it. In my mind, it was a great gift and I counted the days until he could open it.

My little sister was furious when I told her what I got him after I had arrived at the house for the holidays. Absolutely livid. With her loud voice barely contained and her finger pointed at me, to the point that I refused to tell my mom what I got for my stepfather. 

But Christmas Day eventually came, I still come home every other month or so to my stepfather flying the little helicopter, chasing our boston terriers around. 

So it's a year later and I can't for the life of me figure out how I can top last Christmas' success. I'm still a broke college student

Anywho, and two brothers. Below are basic profiles for all of them. We're all fortunate to have good jobs and basically acquire anything we need on our own, so I typically stick to fairly quirky or silly gifts for ""the people who have everything"" so to speak. 

We all live in the Midwest in the United States. Budget-wise

Feel free to recommend a gift for any or all of them! Thanks in advance for the ideas!

 *Mom:*

* Age: 58

* Career: Accountant in small family business

* Hobbies/Likes:


- **Cooking.** 

She refuses to buy kitchen gadgets for herself but is always blown away by how helpful newer appliances can be. I.e. she still had her old food processor she received as a wedding gift 36 years ago which barely worked

- **Reading** (she has a Kindle but loves printed copies as well)

She's a big fan of historical fiction (i.e. stories written during significant historical events from the perspective of a fictional character

- **Community service** 

No she's not a convict haha, schools, etc.

- **Board Games** (she mercilessly thrashes all of us at Scrabble)

- **Traveling with friends**

When their schedules occasionally align, etc.

* Career: Pharmacy (owns his own small business--a community retail pharmacy... that's where my mom also works as an accountant)

* Hobbies/Likes:


- **Planes** (has pilot's license

- **Cars** (all around handy man

- **Old Movies and TV shows**

His two favorite movies: ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Sargeant York""... which even I enjoy even though they are older films... Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper respectively. His favorite two old TV shows: ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Amos and Andy.""

 *Younger Brother:*

* Age: 22

* Career: College student

* Hobbies/Like:


- **Gaming**

He and I both enjoy console games as well as both own gaming PCs and love playing online games together to keep in touch.

- **Bacon**

No seriously. Bacon. It's an obsession. 

- **Books**

Primarily scifi/fantasy. He currently has a Kindle that is linked to my Amazon account so he can enjoy all the books I own without having to blow his limited college budget on books of his own.

- **Food**

We're both very into cooking... primarily experimenting with seemingly crazy concoctions which sometimes turn out delicious and sometimes turn out terrifying. He's usually up for any kind of quirky restaurant or new food experience in general.

- **Music**

I'm honestly not sure of his specific tastes in music. I can tell you it is far removed from my own

 *Twin Brother: (nope

* Age: 28

* Career: Dentist (currently back in school working on periodontal degree)

Dad-

* Recently retired from the military (last month) after 21 years

* Enjoys little DIY projects around the house (currently obsessed with new pool)

* Fan of motocross and Yamaha dirt bikes

* Also likes tech gadgets and security systems

Mom-

* Has become obsessed with P90x and all things fitness

* Enjoys sweet red wine and Corona beer

* Big reader


Sister#1- (16)

* Glued to her iPhone (typical)

* Sucker for cute things

* HUGE fan of ""Friends"" television series

* Plays guitar and listens to music 24/7 (what teenage girl doesn't?)


Sister#2- (10)

* Parents bought her a kindle last year

* Loves the pool in the new house

* Actually likes to read (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" type books)

Here's what I know: 12 years old, size 7 shoe, would love cd player, has pierced ears, needs sweaters &amp; socks.    That's it, that is the entirety of what I know. I don't know her name, anything else she likes or even what she looks like.

There are 12 of us shopping for the same girl so I'm going to assume that someone got her the CD player. Sweaters? That means different things to different people and I'm afraid to get her style wrong and her not have a way to exchange it. I am seriously considering getting a bunch of fun colored socks and a nifty bag (backpack/makeup tote/etc.)  Dollar amount is $10 but I'm willing to go up to about $25 total. 

My personal goal is the most bang for your buck. For example I'd rather not buy one $15 sweater when I can get two $10 sweaters. 

Also considering a gift card. (is that tacky?) Local stores are Rue21, Burkes (outlet store), Hastings (movies music games books) Walmart.  I'd rather keep the giftcard local since I'm not sure she has a way to get to other towns. Thinking about Rue21 since its got fun cute stuff. Also Hastings since they have new &amp; used cds.

She has a PHD in immunology so she is more on the intellectual side, Qatar, Germany). She is not overweight by any means, but her and her boyfriend try and exercise and eat healthy. She enjoys wine, a good move (Pride and Prejudice type stuff Walking Dead Dexter Game of thrones).

I have gotten her nice earrings and a necklace, so the jewelry department is kind of done except for a ring, which I have been told is a bad idea unless marriage. All i have for her is I was planning on going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans and wanted to save money for that, but I don't know how to get her something that would relate to that without being underwhelming. My other thought is she has a really crappy phone (blackjack very old) and doesn't have pictures/social media etc, which girls these days seem to really like for taking pictures and loading them on FB or isntagram and generally documenting their excursions. She does have a camera, but her parents pay her phone bill and that would require an upgrade (she has basic phone unlimited text) so that idea is shot since you can't have an iphone without the data plan.

I think something sentimental would mean a lot to her. She is very fashionable, very compassionate, likes reading. Has a nook, but no books on it (can't you pirate these?). She doesn't wear make-up, naturally beautiful. 

Current ideas are:

An outfit of her choice

Collection of scarves of assorted colors

Pedicure

Date night

Picture frame with our pictures

Flowers?

uhhhhhh... very sweet girl. chocolates?

My father is an amazing person who has been given a raw deal in life. Without going into great detail, OR while I attend grad school. Needless to say I am extraordinarily poor as a result of my extensive schooling. 

I am looking for some presents for both of them that will not leave me even poorer than I am now. A rough price would be $100 worth of gifts combined for the two of them. My father is a Ravens fan but otherwise has very few hobbies. He is a small business owner who runs his own trucking/paving/excavation company. Anything that could make his job easier or more enjoyable would be ideal. I am contemplating a round hitch lock since he got his equipment trailer stolen out of the driveway last week

My brother is 6. He is very into construction stuff(he wants to be like Dad). He also thoroughly enjoys the outdoors

He has talked about a tablet, though I'm not sure he'd really use it.  Still he likes to have the latest toys.  He did have an original Droid 1, and had a car GPS when they started making them, etc.

Other interests, so I'm not sure if there is much room for gifts there.  Maybe a cook book or something along those lines?

Also, so they have gone to several games there.  And he is also a Pistons fan being from Detroit.  But I would say they try to watch most Thunder games, and it is just about the only thing they watch on TV.  He also loves cars, as most boys who grew up in Detroit do.  I think his first car was a used 57 Chevy, or something close to that.  Last year I got him a model car with some paint, that we put together.  We used to do that when I was a kid, but I have sense grown up finished college and just started working at a real job.  I was thinking it might be cool to do another model

1352861489.0,135s2y,Boyfriend and I are buying for his Mom and Dad and sister.,polarregression,2,0,2,"I have been going out with my boyfriend for almost a year now, and about his past presents:

DAD: His' in his mid to late 40's and is self employed as a radio/commercial voice.  He records commercials on TV, and he plays Guitar and perhaps Piano.  He's into classical rock, oldies, some alternative, and is very open minded and exploratory about any genre.  He also likes moving around and doing things (not necessarily handy-man though).  I have no idea what the BF got him in the past.

MOM:  She's in her mid/late 40's, and she gets out in the community every now and then to do different things.  She loves reading.

SISTER:  She will hopefully be an easy one... She's a teenager in her last year of highschool, and she plans to continue it in college, which she will be attending locally.  She does wear makeup, and she likes clothes shopping, but she's usually in sweat pants and a hoodie with her hair pulled back.  She got her license last summer, but she doesn't have a dedicated car to her name yet, I believe.

I would like to leave him something special before I go to work that we can enjoy when I get home on Christmas Eve.  I like the idea of a Christmas Eve Box and I have a couple of things to put in it (details below)

I am thinking of maybe doing some sort of scavenger hunt with little packages at each place containing what we'll need for the night.  For example:

He wakes up to a text from me with some cute riddle to find the first clue.  When he figures it out

So here's where I need help: 

What else do I put in there?  
--I'm making him 2 pairs of PJ pants for christmas
--I have some really nice hot cocoa packets
--I'm thinking I'll make some cookies


Riddle ideas? Not too hard.  He's smart but gets frustrated easily.

I was thinking he could open all of the packages at the end...or maybe he should wait until I get home?  As he finds them?

The goal of it all is something he can do ""with"" me until I get home and then actually with me. We're pretty broke so the cheaper the better.  That being said,False,,t5_2vjt7,False,,,t3_154zp8
