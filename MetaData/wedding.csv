I'm currently married--haven't been for altogether too long, too worried about ruining a tight friendship we had forged. When neither of us spoke up, we ended up with other people, were mutually crushed, and we lost contact for a couple of years. 

But, he moved across the country to be with me as I finished some school, I moved down the coast as he went on to his next phase of training, and here we are, years later: with two dogs, in a sunny little apartment, in the most phenomenal relationship I've ever even heard about. 

But, invested, and like I have an official teammate to weather life with; it's a joyous sensation.

Our marriage came about on the heels of oppressive medical bill debt. He had surgery to repair a ruptured ACL, ""Hey, we know this is it. Why don't we go to the courthouse and get married? I will throw you under my health insurance, and I'll have the peace of mind that you're covered."" 

...and so we did. 

I think we both underestimated how much it would mean to us. It was supposed to be in effort to assist in health matters (knowing full well that we will be getting married anyway in a couple of years when medical school timing for both of us is appropriate)

The point being: when two people love each other to a degree that they vow to spend the rest of their mortal lives as one, and money, and location.... take a deep breath. Because, from the other side of all of that, I can tell you that it's amazing. 

Be well

I'm the girlfriend of one of the bride's sword men (marine corps tradition for a sword ceremony involved in a wedding) and flew out with him to North Carolina from San Diego as his plus one. I had met the bride only one time before. 

I volunteered to help with any last minute wedding stuff she needed done having no idea how much was left for last minute. She saw on pintrist (damn pintrist!) a stick arch she loved and wanted and I commented how simple it would be to construct (not two day simple...); so that became my mission. 

We hunted for sticks in the woods near by (she specifically stated how she would NOT allow anyone to cut any sticks off of living trees in an effort to be green) and I went on probably 6 trips to find ""good"" sticks...later on in the construction (as seen in the photos) she decided she wanted the arch wider because she wanted to stand UNDER it for her vows

So after 48 hours of pretty much non stop work, constant risk of collapse, and sleepless nights...here is the final product! What do you guys think?

Finally done
These required an obscene amount of careful measuring and cutting.  I like how they turned out

Total cost of paper, and printing was $41.10 for 43 invitations, with 18 extra gift bags since they came in packs of 20, and almost as many extra envelopes (with a couple sacrificed to printing error).  I didn't have to buy the linen paper, glue, cutting materials, or sealing stamp.  Permanent double-sided tape only came in packs of two, since we're the type of people who might use it again later.  So I got 8 oz for $22.25, wax

What I would do differently:
None of this notches, fold them like a book, stick them to the blue paper with *permanent* double-sided tape.  Also stick the clear stuff to the front with the tape.  The permanent tape is clear, unlike the removable, and if I got the 1/2"" tape instead of the 3/4"", and cut it with scissors, you'd barely even notice it.  Then, I'd make damn sure the RSVP cards fit.  I would get our custom seal made properly in the first place while we had time, but that's not something I would change.",t5_2qhtr

In order to address this

1. /r/wedding posts should be kept to things wedding-related. Questions, and other related and substantive posts are all welcome.

2. Self-promoting businesses or linking to sites that are clearly meant to drive up search results for pages is banned IMMEDIATELY. This subreddit will improve in quality if it's kept free of posts that clearly violate this rule. While this may turn off some- and I apologize if you are affected- this needs to be done to maintain a subreddit that doesn't feel like it's a big advertisement. While this doesn't seem to be a problem so much now

3. Recently engaged? There's now a subreddit for that! Head on over to /r/JustEngaged to post pictures of your bling. Anyone posting ring pictures will be messaged and asked to post their photo in the appropriate subreddit

More changes will be coming as I assess how best to go forward from here.

So I go in on Friday, and it zipped just fine when I bought it. The seamstress looks at it and says ""we have nothing left to let out"", and then proceeded to rip open the seam and show me, that there was literally nothing left to let out. 

It appears that they had taken the dress in by mistake and then trimmed off all the extra fabric. On top of this, which my mom and I refused. They said they would deep clean it and we could get it on Monday. My grandma and mom were supposed to go in Monday to pick up the dress (I had to go back to school) and I didn't hear anything about how it went, so I assumed they didn't go.

I texted my mom this afternoon and asked her if she could pick up my dress

She immediately called me and said that it was physically impossible for my dress to be spotless. She had seen it on Monday and the alterations manager stated that there was nothing that could be done and the dress was ruined. ***RUINED.*** 

The spots that were on the dress had been cleaned with something that made them appear to be grease spots

I have no idea how to approach this. DB claims that they are trying to find another identical dress

Any advice?

1359392114.0,17fpdv,Rehearsal Dinner Tips from recently married restaurant owner,ether_bandit,73,8,10,"Rehearsal dinners can be tons of fun, and as a restaurant owner, but here goes!

The most important thing to do is to keep a sharp focus on the big picture. This is a once in a lifetime event that you want to be memorable. You're likely going to pay more than you want to, especially if you have a spring wedding. 

* The first step is to figure out your total budget(including gratuity), you can look at restaurants with their menu prices as a starting point. It's far better to feed everyone well at a nicer casual place than to skimp at a fine dining establishment. The goal is for people to eat and be merry in a celebratory mood, not to impress people by feeding them poorly at a fine dining establishment. 

* go to potential restaurants that you would like to use and have a meal there, attention to detail, atmosphere, everything. the people working there may well be the people there the night of your event, and the way they are acting when you are there for dinner is a great preview. If you get especially great service from someone, you can request that they are there. 

* after you have narrowed it down, be aware of what you can spend per person but do not reveal it. The chef should be able to help you plan a menu, and advise you of the options for alcohol. Think about dishes you have had at that restaurant, or favorite dishes from elsewhere. If the chef offers prices, then you can see if they have any wiggle room at all. Some smaller places may want a deposit the week of the event. This is to help them pay for the food they are ordering for you. 

* once you have your spot and menu, who in turn can offer you the exact service you want. If you want speeches after appetizers and before soup, for example, this is a very good thing for them to know. set the order in which things happen, not the exact time unless you only have the place for a short time. Speeches immediately after entrees are finished is no problem, but speeches at 7:45 may not work out. Events always run late, better to go into it knowing this rather than stressing that everything is running late.

* figure out your alcohol policy! there are lots of options. I like the idea of setting a budget, but some people like this approach. You can do full bar, but limit it to all beer and wine and then lower quality liquor. You can do unlimited beer and wine, and a cash bar for liquor. You can do certain beer and wine and no liquor. You can do all of this for a certain time, say during dinner and until you decide to switch to cash bar. talk with the chef, they will help you. 

* putting everyone at one gigantic table is not always the best idea. Tables of 4-8, our parents, and siblings at one table, and then had the rest of our guests at tables of 4. Making the seating chart was fun, and it led to people making friends that they may not have made otherwise. We kept husbands and wives together and mixed couples. From a kitchen standpoint, splitting people up can make the evening run smoother. If you are going with an independent restaurant, serving a huge party at one table may just not be possible. If people are split up they can order in waves

*  Some places may want to charge you a venue rental fee, then this may be more reasonable. We went to a place that was just big enough, and they simply wanted us to match their sales for the night. this was awesome, as we could really take the time we wanted to take and not have to worry about other people's screaming kids or anything. 

* Expect a 20% gratuity. if you are making a ton of special requests from the staff,000 and they want 25%, the extra 5% is only $50. If they are unwilling to waver on this, is it worth it to lose the spot you want over $50, especially if the chef has been very flexible on food and alcohol pricing?

* ask your wedding photographer what they would charge to shoot this event. If you have a friend who takes pictures ask them. ask your florist about flowers. ask your cake maker about a groom's cake

* if you have the place to yourself for the night

* at the end of the night, then you'll be pretty confidant that the restaurant did not add any drinks in. 

* Remember that while you may have rented out the entire restaurant, or other stuff you would not normally do. The staff is there to accommodate your reasonable requests.

* don't get wasted. you don't want to be hungover on your wedding day.

Hope this helps you! If you have any more questions,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1359401924.0,,,t3_17fpdv

Well, it was frightening! She always repeated ""they can't start without us, we have plenty of time! They can't start without us, we have plenty of time!"" like a mantra. So after about 15 minutes the pants were as good as new or even better than before.

1333997229.0,s16mb,My best piece of advice for those planning their own wedding.,,67,6,21,"**The short** - do not tell anyone anything. Not a single detail. Surprises are fun.

**The long** - there are exceptions, ask her to not tell anyone else about your dress.
Your grandma hates roses. Don't let her know that's your flower.
Friend A hates Friend B. Don't make the guest list public.

There is always going to be someone who dislikes something, and that is how it should be, unless you hire a wedding planner/trusted friend. Maybe your MOH points out you shouldn't have an open bar because you met most of your friends in AA - this one we can let fly. There are good opinions/suggestions, and then there are the ones that are just *opinions*. 

I came to this conclusion when my husband's mom picked out a very non-traditional headpiece for me (she showed me a bunch, she went behind my back and told everyone my headpiece looks like a piece of pizza (in fact, it looks like a miniature top hat with feathers sticking out, and in no way resembles food). Not only did they now know what it looked like, they were also not looking forward to it.

I, then told my sister (who also likes surprises, and did not appreciate being told everything). If I could go back and change one thing, I would have kept every single thing that I could, a mystery. I do not like being told what to do, how I should wear my hair, what shoes I need on, when it is my own wedding. My mom had two weddings - shouldn't she be tired of planning them by now? ;)

Certainly not everyone will be or is or was in this situation, haha. Then it turned into a bad family sitcom.

1345560623.0,ykysu,Friendly tip from your wedding videographer/photographer,dangrous,66,9,24,"I've been filming weddings for almost 2 years now (photographed a couple

Quite regularly, for as long as it takes to get their picture/video (which is footage lost for me). Being that I'm the one getting paid to get this shot, I think it's safe to assume that the couple would rather I get the shot than this guest, right?

Being that social sites like Instagram, there are even more people taking pictures/video at big events like weddings, which means even more people not being aware that I've been hired for this very thing. I've done a bunch of things to make it clear that I'm the pro: Said it every time I ask someone to get out of the way, dressed the part, carried around big bags for no reason...still, it's crazy how people don't really care :(

Only less than a handful of times I've filmed a wedding has the person announcing that the wedding is about to start (if such a person exists) has asked to silence all cell phones...***and to be aware of the photographer/videographer***. I've heard about some weddings where it is announced that the couple has asked that everyone put their cameras away altogether. Having just gotten married myself almost 4 months ago, guests shouldn't be getting those pictures/video clips at the expense of the pros!

This tiny announcement has helped me get perfect footage. I wonder why this hasn't been announced more often?? All they have to say is ""please be aware of the professional photographers and videographers [over here and over there]

A little thing that also helps immensely is roping off the center aisle. You can do it any fancy way you want (I used tulle and flowers)

More often than not, for your friends to see online (I post mine on a public Facebook page, and they are able to be shared with whomever). That way, guests don't really even need to take matters into their own hands in order to see pictures/video at all.

Hope this makes sense...it would help us out a ton!

TL;DR - Make an announcement right before your ceremony begins to tell guests to turn off their phones/electronics...and ALSO to be aware of the photographers/videographers so they don't get in the way trying to take their own pictures. Also,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1345577884.0,,,t3_ykysu

I was just taken aback. I am pretty liberal in the do-what-you-want for your wedding department

Boyfriend offered to pay, but to be expected to pay upfront to offset the cost of the wedding seems entirely ridiculous, greedy and stupid. If you can't afford the wedding you want, then get your parents to help or lower your expectations - or go to city hall, or something. Just because you're young and have limited funds does not mean your guests should pay for your wedding.

**1) BE FLEXIBLE.** I don't just mean this in a shallow, that has to be changed? Wow, looks great now!"" or ""The wholesale florist didn't get enough flowers so we have to run to Harris Teeter and get more? Ok!"" (By the way, turns out that Harris Teeter has *gorgeous* flowers!) The thing is, the only thing you'll change *whatsoever* by being inflexible or stressing is... yourself. And the attitudes of those around you as they take in *your* stress. The more relaxed and flexible *you* are, the more that rubs off on those around you, and the more relaxed the day will be.

**2) Take some time to be by yourself.** I had a 5:30 wedding, it was the most precious gift to have that morning. Even if you're an extrovert or having a morning wedding, take a little time (maybe a 30 minute bath, just something slow and soothing) and be alone.

**3) Take 10 minutes with your new spouse.** The first thing my husband and I did (HUSBAND! *Dang* that's so cool to write!) after walking back down the aisle was go to the room where I got ready and sit by ourselves for 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes seriously flew by

**4) Feel how you feel, but it wasn't nervousness. I had a twinge of butterflies when I was about to turn into the venue, as I thought ""when I leave here, I'll be married!"" But other than that, total peace. You may be so jittery you can't sit still for 3 days. You may cry a lot more than you think you will (shoot I cried buckets), or you may not cry at all. Those things are all *ok.* Take them in your stride.

**5) Focus on what matters.** Decorations are fun. Food is yummy. It's nice to have pretty pictures. But none of that is why you're there

I was given rings to put on dresses I wanted to try

Then I was told to wipe my hands with an antibacterial wipe, even though she wasn't touching any dresses...and didn't have a trash can for her to throw it away in so my mother had to ask. 

I fit mostly into 16s, just to see!) So she pulled them...but then each time the next dress was a 14, she'd point out again that it wasn't going to fit and even asked me if I just wanted to hold it up in front of me. No, no I do not - I want to put it ON. And, shocker, they went on and just didn't zip all the way. I was able to tell if I'd even like them. She did the same for the too big ones -- kept trying to get me not to try them on. Why? I can pull it together and see how it would fit. If its a dress that can be ordered, why not let me decide?

They also mentioned numerous times in my short visit how all their dresses are one of a kind. I'm not sure who believes that

I also did not want to put on a strapless bra. They never fit me correctly without custom ordering and they're uncomfortable. Plus

Also, the consultant said something like, ""I don't know what you mean. It's lovely and makes her look great"" and ""don't listen to them, hun, it's great"". No, it didn't look good. Not at all. And of course I'm going to listen to my 2 favorite and most trusted women - that's why I brought them.

The consultant wasted a lot of time -- shouldn't the point be to get me in and out of dresses quickly so I can try on a few? She actually fastened up the dresses I had just taken off and put them away before even letting me get into another. A better way to do this would be to help me in a dress, not leave me in the fitting room alone and undressed for long periods. 

Speaking of the mirrors

Also (and this happened elsewhere) I did not like the consultant telling me what I should or should not do. I do not want a train at all, you shouldn't do that"" or ""Oh you don't really want to do that, trust me"".  No, trust ME. I know me and I know my style - I do not want a train. I know this. Having someone who met me 20 minutes ago telling me what my style should be is annoying. Same goes for the veil - I don't want one, so quit telling me that I'll rethink that later and change my mind.

Here are the details

**Asking her father for permission**

A month ago we traveled the 5 hours to spend the weekend at her parents house. I was really nervous about being able to get alone time with her dad (and hopefully mom too) to ask them for their blessing. Luckily for me they have been getting up early every saturday to go to the gym. So all I had to do was get up extra early and was able to talk to them both for a long time before my now fiancee woke up.

**The Ring**

I was really worried about the ring size being several sizes too big. I had the correct ring size ordered

The venue's insurance company is requiring them to refund all monies and resign a contract if we want to still have it there with tents. I personally thought their tents look tacky so we decided not to do that. One of the other venues in the area has offered to discount their rental fee $500 if we choose to book with them. We toured the new venue yesterday and were taken away with all the scenery and the grounds. http://www.lilybarn.com/ if you are interested. We are in the process of signing the contract for the new venue. (they had to write up a new contract for the weddings they are taking on from the other venue) I am so excited and relieved that we found a better venue so soon after the other venue burned.

Limited backstory is - I got engaged 2 years ago, unable to find work).

About 4 months ago

Over the course of 4 months - I kept all my receipts. I showed itemized budgets to my father. We did go over, shook his head, and wrote the check saying 'I knew we were going to spend over, don't worry about it.'

I cleared the Reception and Menu with my dad a month ago. I knew we were going to need to adjust down on the menu options

My mother called me this morning. I am 48 hours away from getting married and told me that they may be able to pay for the reception (approximately $5

Whatever. My mother's odd behavior aside, how do I swing this? I believe it's too late to cancel anything, so is my current plan of maxing out all of our credit cards and then paying it off with returning all of our gifts legit?

This is, but I need some advice from 'those that have gone before me'.

Thanks

Edit: Update Numero 1. 
I've spoken with my dad and he seems to be under the impression my mother has gone crazy. He assures me that they will be able to cover it, but I knew money would be a stressor right before the wedding. Essentially my dad wont accept any of my help, and my mother is threatening divorce if I don't pay for everything. At this time I am kind of stuck between two very angry people, neither of which will give me a budget to keep it under other than 'We wont pay for anything' or 'don't worry about it, we can cover it.' Neither of which are budgets. I have reduced the menu down to bare bones and also am considering drink tickets instead of an open bar. I don't think the overall cost will be lower if I paid in cash, and I am working with the venue to limit costs

I will talk to my fiance about how his parents would feel about paying for the reception instead of our Honeymoon like they had originally offered. I also like the idea of volunteering to pay my parents back for half of the reception cost, so I don't think the loan route will be feasible or any less expensive than a credit card.

I'll let ya'll know how it shakes out. But I think this is a good thread for anyone that gets stuck in my situation as well.

Edit/Update #2: Spoke with my father. We have gotten the catering budget into a reasonable alignment and we are setting a limit on the bar tab. Now I will address some assumptions folks have made.
1.) I never expected my parents to pay for this wedding. I planned 2 wedding dates, I planned a courthouse wedding with a small reception.
2.) My family STRONGLY opposed elopement. And by strongly, I said, let's have the ceremony and reception on the property of my fiance's grandparents. Simple country wedding, using their barn as coverage. My mother threw an absolute fit because there weren't enough 'nice hotels' in that area for people to stay at, and told me everyone would 'try to drive home drunk and die, then it would all be my fault.'
3.) So fine, 'But I really don't think we can afford a ceremony and all these extra people' and they pushed for it because 'I only got married once.'

I am NOT a bride that dreamed about her marriage since childhood. In fact

Reddit- I love you guys, because I trusted the people in my life to be there for me and help me when they were the ones guilting me into over budgeting and promising that they would pay. This wasn't a 'Tee hee here's the final bill dad' situation. This was a 'Here are several options, I've mapped out them in rank of increasing expense. Which would you like to help me with?' And they inevitably pointed to the most expensive option. When I tried to tell them 'Well, that's kind of expensive...' They would say shit like 'You only get married once' or 'Don't worry, we have you covered.'

Edit #3: Also the Open Bar was at my parent's initial suggestion because they didn't want to give people the impression they were being 'cheap'.

Edit #4: I feel like you should all see this thing full circle. It's the morning of, that all three people should be looped in on the conversation, and it should never be assumed he will communicate anything. As someone mentioned - they obviously have some big issues in their marriage that they are working through, and we have all luckily come to the conclusion that my wedding can be a learning device to all move forward with our mutual lives. I have spoken with my mother and committed to the following things so the wedding will not be so stressful for her - My fiance and I will help her with my two younger siblings and all their weekend activities so they do not need to hire professional movers. We will also both offer our lifting services, and those of our friends, and all of our vehicles (we have trucks and large vans) to get their house moved out by November 1st. If they are unable to afford a portion of our wedding, or it puts them at a financial strain to do so, we had a discussion about any 'future assistance' in the form of a down payment, but was unable to cancel 48 hours before the wedding on any of my contracts. It would not have saved me *any* money. 

Moral of the Story - There will always be drama right before your wedding. Somebody will always say you aren't 'doing it right' or 'shouldn't be doing it this way.' Even if they don't say it to your face, and never assume that everything you discussed with one parent is being communicated back to the other. And finally - for the love of whatever you find holy and sacred- plan your own wedding, don't let other people plan it for you. If this had been planned by me and my fiance and *only* by us, it would have had half the guest list and cost a quarter as much.

Was asked to stand for one of the two of my best friends, so there was plenty of time to arrange and save up for everything. She isn't helping us bridesmaids with any costs, which I didn't mind that much. There was enough time to save up for everything even for the girls in school, and myself who has been in some shitty financial situations recently. So the dresses are bought, shoes are ordered, save the dates are out. I get a text tonight saying she is cancelling everything and getting married in Cancun in January. So now what was going to cost me about $600 is going to be around $3000. I have applied to some crazy pipe dream schools for the fall where I would be an international student. The tuition is crazy, but it would be a life changing opportunity for me. I don't know if I can afford this vacation! She's giving us less than a year notice and quite frankly I would rather spend that kind of money on tuition. I'm just working a bar right now, it's not that big of a deal"". But her husband makes $100K a year

TLDR: Bride changed wedding from local to Mexico with everything half planned. Poor student bridesmaid can't afford that shit.

UPDATE #2: Apparently enough people have said they can't go now that they've cancelled that plan to go to Mexico and still do it at home. They're cutting the reception but going a vacation now instead to ""save money""

So thank your vendors often. Tell them how happy you are when they do good. If they mess something up, and they'll return the favor.

1327343985.0,ot66m,Some advice from someone who processes photos for a living:,thismustbethursday,46,3,9,"I work in a photo lab and I process a LOT of wedding pictures. There are a couple common mistakes that lead to headaches for you and us. 

-First of all, most receptions are indoors, and nine times out of ten, the camera is handled by the elderly and young kids, who don't know how to keep their fingers out of the view finder, much less how to turn the flash on. Many people don't understand that the lens doesn't see the same as a human eye. If you really must do this, expect to pay at least $100 to get them all processed and developed with a couple of good pictures to show for it among many many pictures of thumbs, silverware, I would strongly recommend only getting the pictures processed onto a CD first. That way you can choose which pictures you want

-Crop your pictures before sending your professional photos off to us to be reprinted if you are changing sizes! This is because your photographer edits his/her photos to fit a specific size. You can't just turn a picture formatted to fit an 8x10 into a 4x6 or 5x7 without cutting out part of it, but the reason you are printing your photos here is to save money. The reason your photographer charges so much is because of his/her education in photos, and the individual attention. We simply don't have the time/resources to sift through your 500 pictures and individually crop each one.

-Call immediately after placing the order, but mine has software that takes digital orders and defaults to auto correct brightness/contrast levels. In my opinion, it makes the pictures look terrible. 

-There are always coupons. Don't be afraid to ask. 

-Buy the copyright release. Please don't put us in the position to break the law for you. You may not think it's a big deal, you are asking a stranger to put his/her job on the line so that you can save a few bucks. Would you do that for a stranger?",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,True,,

She's got a tea party, Hepburn inspired short wedding dress; and she emailed me the other day to say she had found and bought the perfect one... For thirty dollars at a Forever 21.

That in itself is not the problem. The problem is the dress is awful

I do not say this lightly. I myself had a jealous bridesmaid insult my dress (it was traumatic and I had to eventually uninvite her for other reasons), and telling her that the dress is really unflattering. My sister is a glamazon; big boobs, hips, and legs. I won't go into detail about the dress; but the way it is cut and sits emphasizes all the wrong things and hides all her beautiful features, and is way too short for her height. It is also way to informal for what she tells me the wedding will be like.

My sister is stubborn to a fault; I've talked to the other bridesmaid (my best friend) and we both feel the same way about the dress

Basically,000 cash and a paid-for honeymoon if we decided to not have a wedding because it would be cheaper for him. He said he’d even call my parents and see if they’d match him because it would be cheaper for them too. I didn’t think that my parents would go for it because they are very traditional. However, I talked with my Mom about it yesterday, just to see what she thought, and she didn’t seem upset at all and, in fact, liked the idea

My dilemma is that I’ve always dreamed of the (somewhat) traditional wedding with the ceremony and reception and the whole nine yards. But,000 (or possibly $4,000) would be a nice start for a savings for us to build on and… FREE HONEYMOON. The more I think about the offer, the more appealing it becomes to me, but I’m still conflicted because, let’s face it, I want the big party too. I’ve read all the advice and suggestions on making sure our wedding doesn’t become a bill for us to pay off after the celebration and my FFIL’s offer seems like a great way to not do that… We’d be getting paid to not have a wedding. 

What does weddit think? Should I accept my FFIL’s offer? Or should I stick to what I’ve always wanted and try to do our wedding on a tight budget?

TL;DR – FFIL offered $2

Her sister and the other semi-local bridesmaid have been planning and talking and whatnot, wedding help, or anything, and although the other bridesmaids don't seem to care, the bride seems to have taken this as a personal slight. I've mentioned that I'm completely in the dark about things to both them and the bride, but it hasn't changed. The bride seems very irritated that I haven't ""contributed"" enough, and I feel like I'm failing to meet expectations that I didn't know were there to begin with. 

I feel like for the past several months, she's preoccupied and busy, I've tried to be understanding. 

This all kind of culminated about two weeks ago when I was just chatting with the bride over facebook and she seemed to have a bit of a meltdown. She told me she was sick of me talking about my life and the things I was doing (I don't think I'm a very self-centered person, that's ok. Then she proceeded to tell me I hadn't payed enough attention to her and her wedding. 

Here's the thing. I introduced her to the groom. I've listened to her gripe about her long-distance relationship for years. I've helped them through fights when he was 1000 miles away, I spent hours with her shopping for her dress and accessories, picking out a cake, on youtube for 3 hours debating first-dance songs. I'll admit I haven't helped much with planning for the shower or parties because--again--I'm being left out of the loop. 

All of this I could take in stride, you know..."" and other veiled threats. I've gone from feeling a bit confused and dumped on to irritated pretty damn fast.

So I'm a pretty complicated situation. This is going to be a long story

This story involves 4 people, and myself.  About two months ago I told my friend Sarah, who is close friends with my girlfriend, that I was planning on proposing in early August. A few weeks later, Paul texts me and lets me know that he is planning on proposing to Sarah in June.  He lets me know this because he doesn't want me to feel like he's stealing my thunder.  Personally I could care less who gets engaged/married first...

Now

As I mentioned before, but she has expressed that she can't help feeling a little disappointed that she isn't engaged first.

That being said
Now that Sarah has been engaged for about a week or so...she has been talking to my girlfriend about her wedding plans constantly... This would be a great bonding time for them...except Sarah has started to take multiple key ideas from my girlfriends wedding plans (which they discussed in great detail before all of this).  For example... 

My girlfriends favorite flower since she was a little girl is the Sunflower. All of a sudden Sarah's favorite flower is the Sunflower and she wants them in her wedding. I've known Sarah for 6 years..NOT ONCE has she ever had sunflowers or talked about them. 

My girlfriends talked about how she wanted her colors to be yellow and gray. She showed multiple pictures to Sarah in the past months of how she envisioned her wedding. All of a sudden Sarah's choice colors are yellow and gray...

As I stated before, but frankly I'm starting to feel pretty angry myself. I would love to hear everyone's insights in the matter... whether you feel my girlfriend and I are being unreasonable in the matter, or if you have advice for us. I appreciate it!

Each of the boxes was a surplus ammo box I bought online. These boxes themselves make great gifts - they're sturdy and waterproof and make excellent tool boxes or tackle boxes. Each box was spray painted with their name (only one visible) and on top ""ZOMBIE SURVIVAL KIT"".

As far as the contents - really the leatherman knife/tool was the main part of the gift

- waterproof matches
- firelighters/cooking fuel
- Army MRE meal
- cheap compass
- cheap binoculas
- length of rope
- water bottle
- no-doze pills
- Zombie weapon - in the photo it's a pipe wrench

The contents have all been moved/fiddled with (and you can see my brother's watch) so it's not presented well in the photos

All week the forecast called for severe storms, I woke up and the sky was clear and although there was a lot of cloud cover in the afternoon the rain held off.  

The ceremony went off without a hitch, which nearly doubled the cooking time.  The cork screw broke off in one of the wine bottles.  The CO2 tank in the kegerator was empty.  The control box for the sound system was locked.  We had no booze, no music, and the only food we had to set out were finger foods.  I panicked.  Then they kicked me out of the kitchen.

We found someone to unlock the control box

Amazingly, for all you soon-to-be brides, take a breath and remind yourselves:  If there's something you planned that doesn't happen, no one will know the difference.  Everyone who is there loves you and will think it's the greatest day ever, no matter what.

* Good News: I'm 90% sure he will say yes
* Bad News: They live 5 hours away
* Good News: We're going to visit this weekend
* Bad News: My girlfriend will be around the entire time

So I see these as my only two options:

* Call her mother tonight or tomorrow and ask her to find a way to keep my girlfriend away and busy for a while.

  * Cons
     * Her mom has no poker face and I seriously doubt her ability to keep the knowledge to herself
     * Her mom has actually already expressed interest to me that she wants to be involved in this conversation  (a comment she made months ago)
   * Pros
      * I get alone time to talk to her Dad

* Hope to God sometime comes up that leaves me alone with her mom and dad
   * Cons
      * Probably won't happen
   * Pros
      * Her mom is part of the conversation


**Proposing**

* Good News: I have the ring she wants
* Bad News: The ring size is too big
* Good News: They ordered the correct ring size I need
* Bad News: The order time is 5 weeks
* Neutral News: The projected arrival time of the fitted ring is plus or minus 3 days of when I plan to propose

So

Also

I'm really stressed out by both of these questions. Any ideas or suggestions will be greatly appreciated!

**UPDATE:** I'm no longer worried about the ring size and won't let it affect when I propose

**UPDATE 2:** Right now it seems the plan is to pull one or both her parents aside tomorrow, or if there is another way to be alone that they would prefer. This is super exciting, thank you all so much for your input!!

**UPDATE 3:** I was able to wake up early and talk to her parents for a long time before she woke up. Everything went great. Now I've only got 1 more person to ask... her!

**UPDATE 4:** Here are the details of the proposal:

I really want my wedding dress to be stunning

Problem? We're both terrible dancers, is likely to turn into a clumsy, awkward shuffle while we just wait for the song to end. 

I've been okay with a lot of wedding compromises. I even was okay with an iPod instead of a live DJ... But I really wanted to (for one day, and admired. Now it looks like I'll just be ordinary me, looking out of place in a dress, looking dumb at my own wedding because I can't dance well. It hurts.

What's more, and I should just be happy to be with the man I love. Of course I'll be happy about that, it just sucks on the one day I'm supposed to embody the essence of femininity and grace, I'll just be ordinary me. I'm never the center of attention, have always shied away from the spotlight, but on the one day it's supposed to be about us, I'll look ordinary. 

I'm sorry

**EDIT** Thanks for the advice, so at least we have something basic to work with. I felt better just being in his arms and working on it, so I'm not going to worry so much about it being complex, and he promised to practice it more often with me.

We got engaged in October. Life was busy with grad school and LDR

My wife booked a dress from an extremely reputable-seeming dress maker on Etsy. The style was right

Initially

Mid-March rolls around and no communication (bad sign) or process pics (worse sign) regarding the dress

""I don't have a record of your order, no dress began. This should have been an early warning. No worries, we'll pay in full to guarantee a May 21 delivery for a June 1 wedding.

The end of April rolls around and we get a message that basically reads ""I'm so sorry my etsy store is gone

""What do we do now?!"" We thought. Well, her online ratings at the time were wonderful.

Then it got dicey. No response to emails for weeks, we get a ""your dress will be finished an I will overnight it"" response. AWESOME! This is great.

Some background: My mother was diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer in late 2009. Since then, rendering her unable to digest food as one normally would. She had a stent placed in her stomach that would relieve the symptoms she was experiencing (pain, nausea, vomiting, etc.), but the reality is that after cancer has spread this much, and this procedure is done

For the past few years, she wanted me to have my wedding as planned. She epitomizes the spirit of living life to the fullest and not letting cancer become this dark thing that engulfs you and depresses your spirit for life.

However, as I pray that she will make it to that day. One was fitted a few months ago, but when my fiance and I checked to see if everyone had been fitted (the deadline is today), I saw he had not gone. I sent him a text asking if he would do it. He replied, saying he would consider going tomorrow. I got upset and asked him to tell me if he was really going to do it because I was frustrated with him not being direct about it. I had asked him repeatedly for months, even before my mom became gravely ill.

He called my sister crying

My mother is not bed ridden. The reality is she may be at some point

When my new dress came in today, it was TOSSED over the door, and I was on my own. Ever zipped your own wedding dress up? Not easy! I had to use the hanger..... Anyway, the dress fit. Beautifully. I walked out of the fitting room (because they have no mirrors), looked in the mirror, didn't see my consultant, went back into my fitting room and tried to get the dress off. It was not budging.

1375106890.0,1j9yl0,[UPDATE] Trying to Reason with Future SIL,badcountrygrammar,30,1,9,"So it's been roughly two months since my last post about my future SIL and I'm here to update! I haven't been on Reddit much since I've been so busy with work and wedding festivities. Anywho

After her nasty text message back, so it came down to this. We just want 30 minutes of peace and quiet so we, along with everyone else, can enjoy the biggest day of our lives. I'm not saying that your children would be screaming the entire time, but we don't want to take the chance with any children. We have plenty of friends that are coming and bringing their children and bringing a parent or a babysitter that said they would be happy to watch your children for the wedding. We also offered to hire a babysitter for you, but neither of these options were acceptable to you. Hopefully we can be adults and move past this, and if you change your mind about coming

She didn't say anything back to that. A few weeks later we went down to FH's parent's house for her birthday and future SIL and BIL were there with their two children. They screamed. The. Whole. Time. I'm in no way exaggerating. Future BIL and SIL just let them run around screaming their heads off the whole time chasing the dogs and pulling stuff down off bookcases. They're also the type of people who think it's acceptable to bring their huge dog with them everywhere. The funniest thing was, there was complete silence. It was glorious. Then my future MIL says to me ""Yeah, maybe you made the right choice about them not being allowed at the wedding"" to which future FIL agreed, even though they were also pressuring us to let the kids come to avoid a huge conflict in the future.

The same day, but we don't have the money to fly down there and rent a car and hotel room."" To which future FIL said: ""What are you talking about? We offered to cover most of your expenses for the trip, we told you we would fly you down and you would just have to pay for a rental car for two days and your two night hotel stay in the wedding room block."" Future SIL looked like a deer in the headlights and quickly said ""Oh well, future BIL can't get the time off work to come (Friday before)."" To which everyone rolled their eyes because they had already told us they could get the time off, but that was before they heard about the no kids rule. 

So a few weeks later, and since we have a long standing tradition with my family, we had to decline, but invited them all down for dinner and fireworks on that Saturday, to which they were very excited. I also told them they couldn't bring their dog because there is a strict leash law and my parents dog is very protective and doesn't like other dogs she doesn't know in our house. She said that was fine and she was going to text me when they were on their way down. But they never texted me or showed up. That's the kind of stuff they do. We had planned this for two weeks in advance and they blow us off. This apparently isn't a new thing, as confirmed by other family members.

She also blew off my bridal shower. She RSVP'ed yes

Then just last night they posted pictures of football tickets that they bought for all four of them on our wedding day. The ticket package with a parking pass was well over $600. Kind of a large unnecessary purchase for people who claimed to be strapped for cash. 

As of now

So there's the update. I sincerely hope that any of you dealing with the ""no child policy"" at your wedding have more understanding guests. ",self,t5_2qhtr,1375122156.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1j9yl0/update_trying_to_reason_with_future_sil/
1373408176.0,1hyri2,How do I un-ask a bridesmaid to be in my wedding?,tittysprinkles8022,41,9,30,"I got engaged this year but had been thinking about who my bridesmaids would be for a long time.  I asked these pre-determined girls to be bridesmaids and they all said yes.  Since then, I had been throwing out ideas for fun things to do...sashes, a veil

The next 2 nights were the same.  I was able to go out with the bride and we partied until the morning hours, she said she almost cried during a taxi cab ride because she missed him so much.  We were only in Vegas for 3 days.  She said 3 days is way too long to be apart. Are you fucking kidding me right now?!  Did I really pay to go to Vegas and hang out with people who don't want to go out and just want to sit around and cry about missing their boyfriends? One night, Jen and Kim offered to go get the bride and the rest of us dinner.  They left and didn't come back for 3 hours.  They also would not respond to text, but we saw them posting pictures on facebook of their ""date night"".  When they got back with our cold dinner, Kim tried to blame Jen behind her back and said it was all Jen's idea to go watch the Bellagio show and walk up and down the strip sight-seeing.  Kim said they had a nice little date night though, and wanted to know if we saw their pictures on facebook.  I was mad but kept my mouth shut.  The bride asked when they bought our food and Kim said they bought our food first because THEY were hungry, then walked around with our food for 3 hours before coming back.  WTF.  I am having a hard time comprehending how they thought that was ok.  There was sooo much miscommunication, who likes to play stupid if you call her out for giving misinformation.  People were getting irritated with each other and it took everything in me to keep my mouth shut and not say anything.  Jen and Kim even had the nerve to complain about how we didn't look like a bachelorette party because all the other parties had sashes and boas and veils

 Now I'm trying to organize getting the bride a gift from her bridesmaids.  I thought this would be nice since the bridesmaids collectively have done nothing for the bride (only 3 out of 7 went to Vegas).  I sent an email discussing a gift idea and volunteering to spearhead it.  Jen emailed me back to let me know she thinks I should have talked to everyone before sending an email saying I think we should give a bridesmaid gift.  She seemed very irritated that I would do such a thing.  She also said she doesn't really know if she wants to participate in the gift.  Jen has let me know that I've been way too much drama with all this wedding stuff and I should just sit back and relax instead of try to plan.  She also threw out that she thinks I am the cause of all the drama within this group and the bachelorette party

So herein lies my dilemma...Jen and Kim are bridesmaids in my wedding.  Everything they have done for my best friend's wedding makes me want them out of my wedding.  I want my wedding to be fun, I feel that Kim and Jen cause a lot of drama with the prissy, self-centered, and self-righteous attitudes they've developed.  They like to say that we are all such ""good friends"", but do not include me in any of their plans.  I only find out they went out or got together through Facebook.  

I asked these girls to be in my wedding because we have been friends for the past 19 years and we used to have so much fun together and share all these great memories.  But lately their attitudes suck and I feel like I don't really trust them or feel like they are very supportive.  I have other people in my life who I spend more time with, which is still over a year away, I want to feel like I'm surrounded by people who can be fun and silly, and who love and support me.  How do I ask these 2 girls to not be in my wedding anymore, without permanently losing them as friends?

I am getting married next month in a destination wedding. This is our dream wedding and we are super excited. We are taking a cruise to the Caribbean

Sounds amazing right? One problem though...I ordered my flowers (the bouquets I have had picked out and saved for 2 years mind you) from a place that does ""Realtouch"" flowers. I sent her the photos

The photos came and none of the 3 looked like I asked for. I emailed them back, well it looks like they tossed some greenery in it and it still looks nothing like what I asked for. So I emailed them back. Asking what we needed to do to fix it. Do we need to make it bigger...ok how much? Get more greenery? How much? Just tell me. No response. I called. No answer and no response. I posted to their FB account. No response. 

My boat leaves May 9th. I have nothing for flowers right now for my wedding and I am about to cry. I have looked online at dozens of other places and nobody can delver to me in time at this point. I do not know what to do.

Does anyone have ANY suggestions??? People to contact? Subreddits to post in? I really need some help and I am running out of time!

I've been trying to plan a wedding on a modest budget for 2014 and I recently went on my first dress shopping trip to a discount store to get some idea what might look good on me. Well,000, but that is still a huge chunk of change). 

In case anyone is interested

Since then I've checked out a couple of other stores but I can't get this dress out of my head and I haven't found anything similar. I really don't think the pictures do it justice

But...

a) I'm still over a year out from my wedding! Should I really be buying a dress this early?

b) $1500...argh! My fiance thinks I'm crazy to want to spend this much on a dress.

c) I don't have any family or good friends over here

Unfortunately it is a one-of-a-kind sample dress and once it is sold

On the other hand:

a) It is gorgeously light and airy and I'll be getting married in a hot place overseas

b) I feel like it is something I could maybe wear again to balls or operas

c) I just REALLY LOVE IT. And I do have some money from an inheritance I could theoretically dip into to get it (there would still be plenty left over)

This is the second wedding for which I've been a maid of honor. In the first situation last year, she lightened up considerably and we have a better relationship than we even had before her engagement.

Because of all the trouble I'd had with the first gal, laid-back person. I thought her shower/bachelorette/everything would go smoothly and be a joy. 

Everything was pretty much fine until a couple months ago (the wedding is in July). We'd had a couple disagreements because she kept badgering me to ""lock down"" my own boyfriend (I presumed maybe because she wanted a partner in the planning process?) and it's not the right time for us, the pictures, the venue, the money, the dress, I've heard her complain about all of it--but the real trouble is the dates/details of the shower. She drags her feet every time I try to set a date (I'm throwing her 2 showers in 2 cities so things need to come together soon). She is snarky with me about my choice of date--it's limited because I'm in med school and just trying to eke out my first year, and I have finals/ceremonies/mandatory internships I have to work around. 

Negativity is one thing. But now she isn't responding to my requests to hang out. When we hang out in a group, looks visibly uncomfortable, and goes out of his way to include me. There was a death in my extended family a couple months ago and she barely talked to me about it, even when I brought it up. I can forget about venting about school to her; she just launches into how much harder her situation is because of wedding-this and wedding-that. 

I am honestly doing my best

So I need advice. The fact that my first friend totally returned to baseline after her wedding makes me want to hold my tongue. I know that this friend is incredibly sensitive and holds some major grudges, since the problem won't evaporate in August? My best friend is unrecognizable to me and my feelings are getting hurt. 

I understand that this is ridiculously long but I'd appreciate any insight. Tell me your stories and help me understand the wedding-planning mindset. Thank you :)

For those of you who are recently engaged

Ahead of you are some amazingly hard times

Plans will fall through

But just keep pushing though!

Keep thinking about the real reasons you're going through this, and (possibly the biggest stress reliever) keep reminding yourself that this craziness is only temporary; all this planning and spending and organizing and crying and saving and spending and spending (and spending!!!) will pass by so quickly, and soon you'll be two days away, just like me, making a post like this yourself.

And all that will be left is to party and to see all of your friends and family and to leave on your honeymoon and to have lots of sex and to build your home and to finally -- FINALLY -- be husband and wife. To finally start the family you've always dreamed of. Whether it's 1.5 kids or 12 kids or 15 cats

We made an appointment for the top designer I had picked

Shoot to the appointment. We pick out a number of dresses and start trying them on, and then I pretty much fell in love with it. But there were a couple of other specific dresses I came to try on, so I tried those on as well; the first I didn't really like on, but the second was really, really close to what I felt about the first.

I wanted to put the first one on again. At that point, she had seen the dress, and that it looked terrible on me (bullshit!- it was just as flattering to my figure as the other one was, and my consultant and mother had agreed to that). The manager told me that with my figure, not much in the store was going to look as good on as that dress did. (I am 4'11 and weigh 150 lbs, although I am working on losing weight).

At that point, and at that point, was so shaken up I told my consultant, who was incredibly sweet and really standing up for me to her manager, that I had to walk away. I got back in my clothes and proceeded to leave the store, with the manager harassing me and my mother about buying the second dress the whole way out while the consultant is firmly telling the manager to basically back off, .

A few hours after the experience

I wrote an e-mail to the company's corporate office about my experience, if that's what I had been wearing the exact moment she walked in. I could tell she thought I was indecisive and wasting the consultant's time, but seriously, when we're looking to spend $1100 on a dress, before accessories and alterations, I feel like the manager should have let me take my time and make my own decisions without making me feel fat and like I had no sense in fashion. Is this the norm for boutiques or something? I've seen this sort of behavior on Say Yes to the Dress, but I can't see how it actually works. Anyways, so that experience kind of sucked.

Again

We talked a couple days ago. Long story short, all of which she dismisses--the fact of the matter is, I just plain don't feel like it, and neither does he. She told me that she takes it personally when I say that I don't want to get married right now. There may have been more specific details (about which of my reasons she takes offense to, exactly) but she didn't articulate them. I didn't know what to say to that. This argument actually escalated to raised voices, which is not something that has EVER happened between me and a friend, especially this one. This discussion ended with her saying ""agree to disagree"" over everything I tried to say. The reason why I am unhappy with that is that I don't think she should be disagreeing with me (and my boyfriend!) over my marital status. I tried to say so and was not acknowledged.

The second argument was about one of her bridal showers. People who read the last post will remember that I was stressed because she was being negative and complaining about the choices I gave her. She told me during this argument that she felt that because I had only given her 2 choices of dates, I honestly did my best. When I tried to explain my side of the story she said that we weren't going to discuss it. She repeated that over everything I tried to say.

There were a couple of moments where I felt so attacked that I needed to leave. I didn't, I expressed guilt that I wasn't able to help out with his estate because of school commitments. She told me that I shouldn't feel bad, that I should be protecting my own emotions, and that sometimes I need to look after myself. 

This loving advice made me realize that she may be lacking insight. In both situations the central theme for me is that I am doing my best and hoping it is good enough. In the dead-relative situation

I'm just plain heartbroken (and honestly, obviously, but I just realized that this turned into more of a standard relationship-advice post. I still think it belongs in /r/weddings because of the lack-of-insight situation surrounding her wedding that I described. Should I just let this slide because of other wedding stress that I know she must be under? Should I try to tell her how I feel at the risk of aggravating the situation so close to the showers/bachelorette/wedding itself? I truly want her to have 2 beautiful showers and an awesome wedding and I don't want to stand in her way but at the moment all the planning has me sick to my stomach because I'm so upset.

I apologize if this if the wrong place to post

I have a big milestone anniversary this year

I know this is a long shot, wedding invitation-style request to join us for this special occasion.

I'm thinking something really fancy.  Multiple layers, you feel obligated to at least open it even if you throw it away immediately afterwards.

The problem is that I don't know where I can find someone to make something custom like that.  Especially someone with a sense of humor.

I am willing to pay

My girlfriend and I went ring shopping the other day.  We spent a few minutes browsing and the clerk was giving her different ones to try on

[Option 1](http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/RobbinsBros/0379869_T?$normimg$)

Tonight I found 

[Option 2](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VDIC3xeoL._SL500_AA300_.jpg) 

on amazon, looks better than Option 1.

  Now the money isn't an issue for me.  I could pay cash for either and not feel a pinch, reddit?  Option 1 or Option 2?

If there are other options or viewpoints you'd like to contribute

**EDIT 2**  So I'm fairly confident about option 1, especially since she's going to wear it forever.  A little extra money now for her long-term satisfaction is worth it.  I have also been reading that the lifetime warranty/repair/replace/trade-in/cleaning package that comes with rings from Robbins Bros is worth the extra expense of buying from a major retailer, from a frugal standpoint, so that will help me in justifying the extra expense to her.

My nan lives with my mom and dad and she is very good at making there lives hell if she does not get her way. She was the same with me growing up, i would always cave into her to make my parents life easier. 

Then came the argument with my mom

Since that day they have mostly ignored me

Now it has come to the wedding dress. I have my maid of honor coming with me on Sunday to try on dresses for the first time and i asked my mom if she wanted to come along and she said ""no thanks"" that's all i got.

I just feel so..... lost right now. All the work I've put into this wedding, I know that the most important thing is that I'm getting married to the man of my dreams. We're going to go on a wonderful honeymoon (and get away from this mess!) and I know I'll be happy. But this certainly wasn't what I envisioned for my wedding day.

Right now, it's still smoky indoors (the fires started just under a week ago, and the whole town's been getting smokier every day since Saturday).

We have 160 people that were planning on coming, it's dangerous to be outside.

Unfortunately

When planning for an August wedding

I just don't know what to do right now. Help? :(

UPDATE: We got a venue indoors!!!!!!! The private school that we were hoping to get into has allowed us to hold our wedding there, thankfully!) There are 6 basketball hoops unfortunately, but two will raise up, and we've got cloth to drape over the other ones. We'll be stringing lights across the various hoops so at least it will look pretty when you look up.

It is by no means perfect, as opposed to our former venue in the park outdoors, we have REAL BATHROOMS instead of port-a-potties, and there's hardwood flooring so I can wear heels instead of the wedges I would've been wearing outside (which I didn't love so much). My dress will not get ruined by the smoke now, and the bottom of it should stay cleaner, too. I'm definitely happy and trying to look on the bright side now. It's actually a beautiful school, and I can get ready in one of the classrooms.

It's costing us more money (our old venue was free, and so relieved. It won't be the wedding of my dreams, but we can still make it look nice, and the most important thing is we're getting married! The school is even letting us have the alcohol (which we'd already purchased) and they're letting us use the kitchen to warm up some of our food (most of the food is catered but a few things are not). The photographer is going to meet with us  and do our bride/groom photos somewhere outside (he said the lighting caused by the fire is actually really great for pictures), and then get the rest of the pics at the school (it's not the most attractive place for pics but will have to do).

So I've been working on my July wedding for a long time (obviously!). As you all know

So here's the rub. My MIL calls my fiance and proposes a party on the Saturday after my wedding. Just his side of the family at his aunt's house. The underlying idea would be to celebrate our wedding and honor my fiance's mother (MIL is actually his stepmom

I HAVE to be back at work the following Wednesday after the wedding. I made this commitment long ago and thought it through carefully because this gig will pay a lot of money (money that we desperately need after this shindig). 

My fiance is really keen on the idea. This would drastically cut short our getaway. 

My feelings: When this wedding is over, I have been feeling her loss terribly through this whole process, so I can surely empathize with my fiance. I can even safely say that if it were my family offering up this follow up celebration/honoring of my mom I would politely decline.

This was longer than I wanted it to be. God damn. Words of advice/comfort would be so much appreciated because I am now in full-haven't-cried-this-hard-in-years- meltdown mode.

TL;DR: Dead moms. Too much family. Also hate my MIL for planning shit around my wedding without even consulting me. 

UPDATE** I posted it in a comment

Thank you all for the responses.

The big issue is that fiance really wanted to do this as well.

We came up with a compromise: They will try and hold it the day after the wedding. If it's the day after the wedding

**UPDATE** I sent my friend a message telling her that I had to talk to her about something. I mentioned that I wanted to ask someone else to be my MOH, as a bridesmaid. That I just think it makes more sense that way. And finally, that I hope she understands.

The arbor had antlers from deer the bride AND the groom had killed over the years.  Decorations were empty multicolored shotgun shells with lights in them.  Orange and Hunter Green Crepe was everywhere.  All the flowers were silk bouquets the bride's mother had arranged.

The cake was camo frosted and the tiers were empty bud light 40's from the groom's stag party.  Food was from a local chicken shack (coleslaw and wings and baked beans and the like).

The Bride sewed a camo panel into her dress; the groom had a camo cumberbund, head to toe in hunting gear.  Including face paint.  And guns (not loaded at the bride's request).  The bride's processional was an orchestral recording of ""Freebird.""  The song they exited to was ""Highway to Hell"" by AC/DC.

Just as the wedding began, sternly, and gave the bride and groom a massive thumbs up, blowing his horn.  Everybody basically went nuts at this point, giggling all over the place.  

Post marriage, there was contention over the throwing of the garter, as when the Men organized to go catch it, one smartly asked why.  On learning that the one to catch it was going to get hitched, the common reaction was, and I quote, ""F**k that!"" and the grooms went back to the beer cooler.  The Dude of Honor, got the Groom another beer.

The ever-appropriate gift from bride to groom and vice versa were new hunting guns.  The wedding party got ammunition for theirs.  The honeymoon was likewise well timed -- the day after was the first day of deer season.  Guess where they went?

1360773336.0,18g9tj,How to deal with a psycho bridesmaid?,justwondering87,22,6,15,"This story could be a novel so I will stick to the basics.

I am in my sister-in-laws wedding this coming April.  I am in it with my two other sister-in-laws (the brides sisters) and the groom's sister (problem child 1) and the groom's brother's wife (problem child 2). 

Problem child 1 wants to save money, to the point where she is suggesting things and I am afraid she won't help with the output.  Usually to save money you have to put in more time and effort (again something we are willing to do) but this girl is a lazy brat.  She isn't even the problem though.

Problem child 2 wants the entire thing to revolve around her.  She is coming from out of state (so is one of the sisters of the bride, and she is worse off financially, but she managed to get a plane ticket! The money situation is funny to me because I am currently UNEMPLOYED and I am not complaining. 

 Then, they think she is fantastic, and we are the bad guys. 

What we have done so far to keep her from dicking everyone over:
MOH (bride's sister) sent out an email to everyone saying that we should not include the bride and groom in drama involving the bachelorette and bridal shower.  We should discuss it together like ADULTS.  Talking about it with the bride only causes her undue stress. (obviously!) 
Also, or even the groom for that matter, to avoid problem child 2 changing her flight plans.  We are also having a gathering on that Wednesday as the bachelorette party, but now there will not be pressure to stay anywhere and stay out all night.

As of now though

I met Polly while I was having problems with Mary. She quickly became a close friend who I could trust with just about anything. We started doing almost everything together, to the bars on the weekends and never got sick of each other. 

Then, so we only talk once every couple of months.  Mary, on the other hand, has recently moved closer to my current city, and we've started to hang out more and more.

Some of them are willing to work with any budget

They have found everything for us - the perfect venue, catering, etc. And since they have relationships with these companies, we get a better deal. As a couple, you are a customer once. Wedding planners are repeat customers, so to speak. They find us vendors they have worked with in the past and know they are excellent. Plus, they only show us things in our price range. 

Our wedding is this October

I am so happy.

* The wedding is western/Christian styled (although no one in attendance will be Christian)

* The wedding ceremony will be followed by a ~2 hour reception

* Following the formal reception, it is more or less expected that we will play bingo. 

* Guests give us money! Not super small amounts either. Apparently we can expect upwards of $200 per guest. More from closer relatives. 

* That last point is good, god. For a wedding of about 40 guests, at our not overly priced location, we're paying $23k. This is base costs. This does not include things like wedding photos, dress rentals (the wedding dress RENTAL is another $3k), or the assumption that we'll pay half of our guest's commute costs.

* We're getting $5k from my parents, waiting for the axe that is the bill to fall.

* We are kinda expected to invite our bosses at work, they'd have to sit at the front center table during the reception, while our parents and family would sit in the far back corners. 

* I helped my bride pick out her wedding dress. I've taken pictures of her wearing it. :P

* There is a six day week of 'fortune stuff' in Japan. 1 day is lucky, 1 is lucky only in the afternoon. Wedding places offer huge discounts for weddings on that unlucky day. There was absolutely no way that she was going to go for that. The entire family would have been scandalized. Ours will be held in the morning, on that 'morning is lucky' day.

I don't mind sating anyone's curiosity if you have any questions about... anything. I'm bored at work all week. :D
