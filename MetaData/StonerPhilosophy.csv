The major political axiom of Mufasa's Pride Rock(MPR) is the Circle of Life (CoL).  The CoL basically states that it's OK for the lions to eat as many of the antelope as they can because eventually the lions will die and fertilize the grass.  The grass will then become food for the antelopes.

The CoL can then be seen as a type of ""trickle down economy"" where the ""meal creators"" at the top must have unlimited access to fuck up the lives of a few antelopes in order to maintain prosperity for the other creatures in their kingdom.

The second political dictum of MPR is that there must not be any crossing of the border into MPR by the hyenas.  This is much like the call by many Republican leaders to bar immigration.

So Mufasa = ""ideal Republican society""

Scar, hispanic, and special needs.  All three of these groups are, according to conservatives, the groups that abuse welfare organizations the most.

By promising his supporters perpetual donation in return for political power Scar devises a political coup in a musical number that features him as a fascist leader of a goose-stepping army of the ""moochers.""

Scar's Pride Rock (SPR) then becomes one where the burden on the ""meal creators"" to feed the welfare hyenas is so onerous that there is no food left.  Because of the social justice instituted by Scar

How can it be that I can look at the same things and remain unconvinced? I think the evidence in our world is inconclusive for any ideology

I say to you this next sentence in big, in any case, allow something as inconsequential as my opinion on religion to affect my interaction with a fellow human being. Or any of my opinions on anything, for that matter.

Therefore, even with my lack of faith. Since my withdrawal from the pursuit of religion, I have come to understand the concept of spirituality on a personal level with incredible clarity. I have practiced acceptance and understanding of everyone I see; I have gone out of my way to help a woman find her way to the hospital office she was looking for, and to stop some bully from picking on my friend Chris.

Are these not the things of which Jesus spoke? If these are the good deeds which I strive to do every day, and all circumstances in life because they are part of God's Plan. It has brought happiness and understanding to countless people over the millennia, and hope to the hopeless. I have learned, without religion, to make all of these things a part of my life. I love all people because they are sentient, all animals because they are the life which has sprung up from the incredible planet we all share, and all circumstances in life simply because they are happening in the only universe I have ever been a part of.

I will never lose the desire to understand another person's journey through life because it is exactly like mine and completely different from mine simultaneously. I will never be without hope or happiness because I am infinitely fortunate to have ever existed in the first place. It has become clear to me that these two ideologies are simply means to an end. I defy anyone to suggest that the love in my heart is any less genuine than that of a religious person

1365006130.0,1blfzt,The internet is God,schemeofthings,40,3,9,"One thing I've been struggling a lot with lately, and I've been on too many dates (girl on a dating website - the only limiting factor is time).

But, tonight - I want to know that the people in my life will remain in my life.  Particularly, I want this in a romantic way.  I don't want to get dates easily, I want to know that one of them will stay with me and be there for me.  Basically, I'm craving security.  Tons of socializing and tons of dates, yeah, that sort of scratches the itch temporarily, but when Saturday morning rolls around and I'm trying to sort through my mail or register my car or get my laundry done

I don't get my basic tasks done, I don't do things that need doing.  Because that Saturday morning?  I'm not really sorting the mail or doing my laundry or registering my car.  What I'm actually doing, is wasting time online.  I'm either on reddit, or facebook, or OKCupid, or gmail chat.  And the laundry piles up, and progress in my life doesn't happen.

I'm thinking about this, getting shit done.  But I don't.  Why don't I?  Because of that nagging voice in the back of my head.  The one that tells me that whatever task I'm working on, it's not important, YOU'RE ALONE, GO FIND SOMEONE, THIS IS MORE URGENT!  I find it unreasonably difficult to be by myself getting tasks done, when on a grander scale, the date I might have tonight

I'm not sure if this is abandonment issues, singleness, or plain old internet addiction.  It's probably a bit of each.  But how do I cope with it, what do I do to deal with that panicky voice in my head that fears being alone?

Well, I go out a lot.  A whole lot.  

But even a whole lot isn't ALL of the time.  Every evening isn't every day.  I still am at home sometimes.  What of those times?

Enter internet addiction.  Reddit, Gmail Chat.

What do these have in common?

Interaction.  Or the simulation of interaction.  All of these have me reading things and replying to them.  Posting things and getting responses.  

And...they are *always there*.  Unlike any given friend, they are always there.  As long as I have a computer and an internet connection, interaction is never further than a click away.  And, I think this is the root of my internet addiction, my spinning wheels in life, my lack of forward progress and why I'm not taking control of the direction of my life.  That right there. 

I need to learn to be comfortable by myself.  I need to learn to spend time in my own company, but at least tolerate it.  I really believe that if I can do this, I'll unlock the rest of my life.

Now, so there's that.  But I think about God, or what drives people to be religious, why religious faith is so widespread.  What is God?  God is many things to many people, but now that we as a species aren't living in quite so much fear of imminent destruction at any moment, God has taken on a more loving form.  God is your friend!  He knows you, he cares about you, he listens to everything you think and feel

And that's key.  You are never actually alone, that companion, that connection, filling in the blanks in those moments when there isn't another person giving us the companionship and support that we need.  Other people come and go, but God is always there.  God means you are never alone, and someone out there is always aware of your feelings and struggles, caring about you and supporting you.

(again

Does this sound familiar to something from earlier in this post?

The internet is the same thing.  The internet is always there.  The internet always has a place for you to express whatever it is you are feeling, the internet will never leave you.  As long as you have a computer and a connection, the internet is never further than a click away, and you will never be truly alone.

The internet is God.

Am I a good man? I believe that I am

And where is the line? How does one define. Most men are like swines

I feel very self-aware. I don't know if it scares

to think this deep. To look around at the world as it interacts with you. 

Me vs. the Universe and its chaos as it surrounds me.

To succeed in what I do on a regular basis takes understanding not only the present but also predicting the future. On my motorcycle - on a daily basis - I have to predict every intent of every vehicle around me at all times. It's carnal. I have to dominate traffic - to be the Alpha of the road. That way everyone sees me. Yes. You will clear the lane for me. I have to ride that way to maximize my safety. 

But it changes me. 

It alters how I see.

My intentions align with who I am by design. So I feel quite fine most of the time 
as I act who I am among those who do not. I feed on my instincts

But sometimes I get distant and fade from the risks and the choices 

or voices 

of others - of singles or pairs who dare to share their fair

portion of ocean 

of knowledge or faith in the ways we relate. 

For I'm sure that we do
I'm adaptable, I organize and order. The shorter the time it takes to complete a task increases its inherent value - I think?

If I blink

I may miss all the bliss that surrounds me. 

All the smiles

but I cannot know their stories - only their present action.

I will openly admit that I could very well be wrong, we have to introduce terms such as ""dark matter"" and multiple dimensions to explain the bizarre way gravity behaves at this scale. Also, the laws of physics

This could account for why the world we experience has such fixed laws of nature. The laws of physics are slightly skewed the further away from us in terms of size it gets. Meaning that our world is the one 'slice' of this reality in which the laws of nature are set so that life can evolve. 

This brings me to the conclusion that the universe is an eternal sea of randomness. The larger you get, the universe will become unrecognisable, and exposed for its true nature - random. The beautiful thing about reality is there is infinitely much more to explore…

Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe.

And Everything was well. Everything grew and grew without limits, watching and smelling and tasting and hearing and touching Everything. And it realized that it felt another thing too, above and beyond and inside and outside of Everything, but different...
It was Nothing, that there was a question to answer: “Do I Matter?” 
So, and Many were confused. As much as Many tried to find the Answer, they had a problem. Because they became so divided and separate, Something was lost and Many had forgotten the Question. Many thought that they had a better Question, or a better Answer, and sometimes Many disagreed with Many, so Many fought a lot of amongst themselves. So Many lost touch with Something and Many lost Everything, and that they shouldn’t care about Nothing and that there was no such thing as “Nothing”
That’s how Many forgot that they themselves were the Something that had began the quest to find the Answer to the Question made by Nothing... And Many started looking for Something without realizing what it was, sometimes some would retain some of the original curiosity, and some almost remembered, felt a little hint of the Question and those were the Few and Few were closer to Something and Everything. 
When the Few came together in peace, and Something didn’t show up for long. Sometimes they tried to make Something happen by singing, and dancing, and lighting candles.

Past
Present
Future

Evolution level 1 is Present - the first and simplest organisms (bacteria etc) just live in the moment - they dont remember yesterday and cant guess what the future will bring them.

Evolution level 2 is Past - by forming memories of things that happened in the past like: a) I ate this thing and it was good and b) I touched this yellow thing and it hurt like hell, they can act accordingly. Big improvement from level 1 in survivability and quality of life. Arguably most mammals have this level for example.

Evolution level 3 is Future - if you introduce imagination and creativity (one of the big things thought to separate us from most animals) you gain the ability to conceptualize the Future. So by experiencing things (Present)

Even the smallest of fractions of those stars having life, lets say a few thousand years ahead of humans.

Only one planet of one star out of the 34,000,000,000,000,000 we roughly know of needs to be this advanced. In an advanced society with powerful computers, a fairly practical thing to do would be to simulate a universe in order to tweak and experiment with laws and such. So just one planet decides to run a simulated universe on their computer. Another use may be to study our own race in the past

The simulated universe runs exactly the same. It has the same 34,000,000,000,000,000 stars and the same number of intelligent planets, maybe more, but it has at least one planet that is of the same technological advancement of the planet hosting the simulation. That planet hosts a new simulation under the same pretences.

(Long post),r3dd_dwarf,25,3,2,"There is a school of thought that suggests that as we age we perceive time more quickly because we have perceived more time in total and our only point of reference for the magnitude of any given timeframe is the total amount of time we have ever perceived.  In other words


Imagine trying to measure a distance across empty space without a point of reference, say, an hour.  What I'm suggesting, however, is that a minute could, hypothetically, be perceived ten times slower by a five year old than by a fifty year old.


There was also a great argument I read regarding possible issues with immortality or indefinite life extension


It’s also well observed that the brain is capable of adjusting and filling in all kinds of blanks in our subjective experience to create a seamless experience.  A few examples of this are:

We see a correctly oriented image even though our eyes produce an inverted image.

Everyone has blind spots in their vision

We can hear a song perfectly clearly in our mind even without knowing the exact notes or lyrics.

Our minds also stitch sound fragments together allowing us to maintain conversations in noisy environments.

You can read entire paragraphs of scrambled words

It also explains many other visual and auditory hallucinatory phenomena.


For the sake of argument let’s all agree that we do perceive time more quickly as we age and we are, but in order to be able to continue functioning, our brain, via a mechanism similar to the one I’ve stated above, adjusts the way we perceive time, leaving behind only a niggling sensation that time “seemed” to pass more slowly when we were younger.

Imagine your retina is critically scarred; your mind can only fill in the blanks up to a certain point. At some stage you will not be able to function visually no matter how well your brain tries to fill in the gaps.


Now apply this to the ever escalating issue of time perception in your mind.  What if your mind can only maintain so much experience and relative reference points of time until it all starts unwinding at the seams?  Increasing stress, a kind of state where all perception and order of time and memory seems to break down.  What if everyone, given a long enough lifespan would eventually suffer this fate as their mind’s capacity to retain the vastness of their entire existential experience is overwhelmed by its ever increasing inability to contextualise it all?

1367739155.0,1dq18m,"Despite what Toy Story 3 wants us to think, our toys *do* kind of die when you give them away",Vortilex,25,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1dq18m/despite_what_toy_story_3_wants_us_to_think_our/, as people came in and either bought them for their kids or kids would buy them

Despite having never played with them for a long-ass time (I would play with my brother while he was still growing up, I still could remember each animal's voice, each animal's character, its ""family"" and ""friends"" in the pile, and as I sorted them out, I seriously had to stifle a tear.

I recalled that closing scene in Toy Story 3 where Andy is telling the girl about each toy. In Toy Story, and you can tell that the personalities Andy and the girl give to them are unique, they, of course, live on.

But not in real life. My dad had come up with unique voices for them when we were much younger, voices I tried to impersonate for my brother when he was still more into them and I was simply being a big brother to him. I hadn't even given the animals a second thought while they sat in storage and after he had essentially put them away for good around the time he entered high school (laugh if you will). However, once I saw them all there for the first time in a long time, I really had to hold back the tears, knowing that the entire group would be broken up. Those that we won't end up selling will get donated, but nobody in their right mind would take the lot, even for free. They'll all end up in new homes, but hopefully most of them being cherished by their new owners, and I assigned to them die the moment they leave our possession. Of course our toys don't get up and lead their own lives when we're not there, those toys that get destroyed by fire

Still, which is what toys are for. On the other, the silly tiger or the plotting maniac may become someone completely different for that kid, and their name will undoubtedly change. I couldn't bring myself to tell any of the kids who looked at the toys what their names were, because I wouldn't want to sell it, and we simply don't have the room to hold all of those things in our new place, and don't want them to deteriorate in the small storage unit that we have for more important things. A tiger once known as ""Blizzard"" will be someone completely new to a new kid, as I stood there trying to do my job of selling our old toys and books

Out of sheer curiosity, and shouldn't be so attached to them, but yet here I am, typing this out as a way to console myself, I guess. I remember when I had just graduated high school, I was also moving from a foreign country, and was also trying to downsize the stuff I had to move. I remember having to sell my Bionicle collection, but when it was time to sell them, but for the fact it was a very near complete collection of every Bionicle set Lego had come out with for five years. When my dad sold those for pennies on the dollar (my own research had shown that my asking price of $200 was almost 10% of its actual value), but when that first buyer told me he was looking for chew toys

In any event, although hopefully new ones will be bestowed upon the stuffed animals once they're at their new homes.

1365707868.0,1c5jup,One of the most trippy short stories ever,IFUCKINGLOVEMETH,29,7,8,"Tim already had his bag and overcoat on and his keys in his hand and was about to leave when Diane stopped him at the door.


""I just got this thing working. You have to come and see it.""


""I have a bus to catch.""


""You can get the next one.""


""They're every half an hour


""It's super-duper. Look at the big screen


""Will this take long?""


""A mere instant. Okay


""That's the name of the game, their eight colleagues, their two supervisors, four chemical engineers, six electrical engineers, the janitor, a countable infinity of TEEO 9.9.1 ultra-medium-density selectably-foaming non-elasticised quantum waveform frequency rate range collapse selectors and the single tormented tau neutrino caught in the middle of it all - represented the sum total of the human race's achievements in the field of quantum computing. Specifically, earlier that week, without hyperbole


Not quite enough time had yet passed for the world as they knew it to be totally and permanently fundamentally altered by this news.


But it was still pretty exciting stuff. Holy Zarquon


They hadn't announced it yet. They'd been programming. Obviously they hadn't built it just to see if they could. They had had plans. In some cases they had even had code ready and waiting to be executed. One such program was Diane's. It was a universe simulator. She had started out with a simulated Big Bang and run the thing forwards in time by approximately 13.6 billion years, but knowing full well there would be plenty of time to run it again later, and mostly just admiring the miracle of creation.


Then, just as Tim was about to be the second-to-last person to step out of the door and go home for the weekend, that her work had come to fruition. ""Look what I found,"" she said, pressing some keys. One of the first things she had written was a software viewing port to take observations from the simulated universe.


Tim looked, ten to the twenty-two stars?""


""Literally no time at all.""


""Yes


""Coding a search routine and figuring out what to search for was what took the time.""


""Is it definitely Earth?""


""Yes. The continents match up to what we had about three hundred and fifty million years ago. I can wind the clock forwards slowly


""Can you wind the clock backwards at all?""


""Ah


""Well we'd better not overshoot the present day


""We can observe the simulation from any angle you like.""


""We need somewhere that we know civilisation is going to arise earliest. Somewhere easy to locate. Is there a Nile Delta yet?""


""...Yes. Got it.""


They advanced a thousand years at a time until Egyptian civilisation begin to appear. Diane moved the viewing port, and there was a lot of Nile to search. In the end she switched focus to the British Isles, and found the future location of London in the Thames valley, scaling back to one-century steps and using the development of the city to determine the current era instead.


""So... this is Earth? I mean


""The simulation starts with a Big Bang as predicted by current theory and is recalculated once every Planck time using the usual laws of nature and an arbitrary degree of accuracy. It doesn't calculate the whole universe at once, all of history - should rise on this Earth precisely how it did in reality. There are no chances. It's all worked out to infinitely many decimal places.""


""This does my head in


""No, suddenly zooming out and panning north. ""I've found the present day, or at most a year early. Watch this."" Hills and roads rolled past. Diane was following the route she usually took to drive from London to the TEEO lab. Eventually, she found their building, and, descending into the nearby hill, the cavern in which the computer itself was built. Or was going to be built.


Then she started advancing day by day.


""That's me!"" exclaimed Tim at one point. ""And there's you and there's Bryan B.


""Four hundred and ten days or something. It was bang on schedule


""Went like a flash, conceding that he had long since missed his bus.


""Okay


She tapped a button just as a clock on the wall lined up with a clock inside the control room on the screen. And panned down. And there they were.


Tim waved at the camera while still looking at the screen. Then he looked up at where the camera should have been. There was just blank wall. ""I don't see anything looking at us. That's freaky as hell.""


""No


""Different people who are reacting exactly the same.""


""And having the same conversation,"" said Diane.


""So I'm guessing your viewing port doesn't manifest in their universe either.""


""I haven't programmed it to yet.""


""...But it could. Right? We can manifest stuff in that universe? We can alter it?"" Diane nodded. ""Cool. We can play God. Literally."" Tim stood up and tried to take it in. ""That would be insane. Can you imagine living inside that machine? Finding out one day that you were just a construct in a quantum computer? The stuff we could pull, then undo everything bad and do it again and again... freeow... man, how unethical would that be? Extremely, clearly."" He thought for a moment, then leaned over Diane's shoulder as she typed purposefully. ""This universe is exactly like ours in every particular, right?""


""Right


""So what are they looking at?""


""A simulated universe.""


""A simulation of themselves?""


""And of us


""And they are reacting the same way I am? Which means the second universe inside that has another me doing the same thing a third time? And then inside that we've got, one inside the other? Is that even possible?""


""Infinite processing power


""I did indeed, so the exact same thing happens in every lower universe simultaneously. So we see nothing in our universe. But all the lower universes instantly diverge from ours in the same exact way. And all the simulated copies of us instantly conclude that they are simulations, but we know we're real, right?""


""Still with you


Tim - both of him - was pacing up and down. ""Okay, EXCEPT the top simulation. And if they're smart, which I know we are, and they can be bothered, which is less certain, the guys in simulations three onwards can do the same thing over and over and over again until they know what level they're at... this is insane.""


""Tim, pressing a final key and activating the very brief interference program she had just written, just as the Diane on the screen pressed the same key, and the Diane on Diane-on-the-screen's screen pressed her key and so on, forever.


Tim looked backwards and nearly jumped out of his skin. There was a foot-wide


Diane smiled wryly while Tim clutched his hair with one hand. ""We're constructs in a computer


""I wrote an extremely interesting paper on this exact subject, in fact. Each of them is identical and each believes itself to be the top layer. There was an exceedingly good chance that ours would turn out to be somewhere in the sequence rather than at the top.""


""This is insane. Totally insane.""


""I'm turning the hole off.""


""You're turning off a completely different hole. Somewhere up there


""Watch as both happen at precisely the same instant."" She pressed another key, the odds are exceptionally good that we are an astronomical distance down that road. And so we are, very likely, almost exactly at that point. Everything we do in this universe will be reflected completely accurately in the universes below and above. That little model there might as well be our own universe. Which means, first of all, we have to make absolutely certain that we don't do anything nasty to the universes below ours, since the same thing will happen to us. And secondly, thereby helping ourselves.""


""You've thought about this?""


""It's all in my woefully overlooked article on the subject


""Guh. This has been an extremely bad day for my ego, there is a version of you who was completely wrong.""


""She's in the minority.""


Tim checked the clock and picked his bag up again. ""I have to go or I'm going to miss the next bus as well at this rate. This will still be here after the weekend


""Well


""Why not?"" asked Tim, realising. ""Oh.""


""Yeah.""


""That... could be a problem.""


""Yes.""

And as we (slowly) try to stop killing each other, we nations are starting to realize that if we all get together and share ideas instead of brutally destroying any idea that doesn't agree with ours, we have the potential to recombine our ideas to create a PLANETARY organism that will survive the fucked up chaos that surrounds us.",,False,,False,t3_1ae83t

Alternatively, if we created in the future a very powerful video game console that would run artificial intelligence. And we made an equally advanced sequel to the video game The Sims.

Think about it like this. Let's say time travel is possible. Let's say someone travels back from the year 3021 to now. If we lived in the present, considering *this* is the present, they couldn't possibly exist yet and therefore could not travel back in time. 
Likewise, the man from 2896 couldn't travel forwards because his time was already past and the future 'present' didn't exist yet. 
Considering both of these things, where the inverse is true. (For example, let's say you travel back in time 20 years to the previous present. The moment you arrive in the other 'present', you couldn't from the future since that hadn't happened yet, so the exact moment you travel back to would become the 'real' present. Forgive me if this sounds confusing as hell, I'm really tired.)
Considering both of these scenarios, where you make your starting point the present and the destination the future, it seems that the only logical explanation is that all possible moments are all happening at once, and it's only our perception that changes.

As they say, what if it means the complete opposite, that multiverses are bounded somehow by imagination. After all, the set of all imaginable universes is an infinitesimally small subset of all possible universes. This puts a new spin on dreams and art. When we see art or write down our dreams, what if that act of observation is like an act of observation from quantum mechanics. By the mere act of observing an imaginary world rendered in artwork, that universe with those characters and shapes and laws of physics exist in some way. Perhaps our understanding of the word existence is limiting in that really existence is all about acknowledgment.

Just like observation, could the mere acknowledgment of a hypothetical world (whether constructed in our dreams or in artwork), be another kind of existential force? That by creating and pondering imaginary worlds we are drawing our own, separate, expanding cone of existence through the grand multiverse timeline.

""The process I have been describing has two stages; the euphoria of encountering unmediated reality, (or, as often happens, occuring spontaneously, but within a spiritual context that gives it meaning for the experiencer), managing the transition back to construed reality after the experience generally (but not invariably) occurs naturally and after a short space of time. Where the same state is achieved by taking a drug, the return again normally (but not invariably)

In psychosis (and drug or spiritual experiences that go wrong, trying to operate in the world. Not surprisingly this is extraordinarily difficult. The familiar boundaries between people, events, time and space are not accessible as before. Telepathy seems normal. Other people can read, and worse, interfere with, the individual's thoughts. Coincidences abound - everything is connected and everything is disconnected. Everything is possible and nothing is possible. Where this new reality might be exhilarating for a short while, clutching at whatever connections come to hand. In this way delusions, and the person hears voices.

1342234170.0,wj73s,I think I just discovered the answer to life after death... and I managed to catch it on paper before I forgot it this time,ShaolinShade,22,4,15,"Basically


There are only three things in the universe: matter, neutrality), and energy (the law of attraction: aka gravity and the forces that cause matter to interact). {**EDIT**: as raptorraptor pointed out, there's actually only two things - energy and lack of energy, since matter is just energy in a different form} A world of binary, if you will - either positive or negative values comprise of everything that exists (everything is breakable down into the form of an atom, which is two forms of energy of which we know almost nothing other than the fact that they're what we call ""matter"" - and it's what makes up EVERYTHING.) So when you look at a skyscraper, or a star, by the simple state of its very nature. A start or end to everything that we know is a concept that is virtually impossible to grasp.

So which value, light or dark, good or bad, is the value of force? Does the power lie within the force of lack or existence? And where do evil and good fall in - are they connected? I realized that if life could be assigned a value, it would be positive. Our souls are orbs of light swimming in a dark sea that's void of life. Positive values amongst the negatives. This led me to realize that good is stronger than evil. Good is the positive value, the value of force... existence. We naturally gravitate towards it: happiness, life, and security. A warrior will be far more motivated by the desire to defend a lover than the desire for revenge.

So at this point I looked for clues within the process of death. Death is the snuffing out of the light that is life into the darkness of the void - flipping the light switch off, and they all share the same story - going towards a light at the end of the tunnel. The 'moving' would seem to signify your progression through time at that moment. The darkness that envelops you is death, but then you approach a light (another life) after that initial entrance to darkness. And on top of that, everyone who's had these near-death experiences always seems to have stories of things that they experienced in that other life... as if they had indeed began to live another life. They also, interestingly, often want to go back.

Note: I would highly recommend reading the article that antibubbles posted below. It addresses the theory that NDEs are chemical reactions in the brain - like the light at the end of the tunnel ""effect""

This seems to be a clue given to us - whether by god, or just the universe itself - about the answer to the nature of our existence, and to what happens after death (if anything). 

**tl;dr: People hide themselves from the answer to existence with specificity - if you forget all bias and reduce everything to it's basic values of positive and negative

If that's the case

 

The only optimistic notion is that humanity is simply at an ideological and spiritual turning point where we may or may not fail depending on how quickly we can start respecting the planet and each other before we eradicate the possibility of the continuation of our species.

 

To even attempt to preserve our planet requires that we assume the latter

 

This is not to say I support drug use. I don't personally use drugs other than tobacco and alcohol, herbal remedies do not fall into that category. Consider that even the food you eat and the air you breathe is systematically affecting your biological organism.

 

Who are you to choose what chemicals are legal for another human being to ingest?

 

And to keep from getting off track

 

To allow outlaw drug use based on a supposition of possible negative societal effects is precedent enough to allow the illegislation of religion on those same bases.

 

After all, Judaism, or fundamental Naturalism (Science as a religion) is harmful to any given person or society does not mean that I should feel obligated to outlaw it, right?

 

There will always be conflict, censoring explicit music, or stopping mosques from being built in the vicinity of ground zero. ""Vulgar"" non-politically correct language, homosexuality, and other offensive acts are being targeted by politicians on both sides of the aisle.

In order to fully explain, humbling, infinite expanse that is the conscious mind. It truly is about a change in **Perception**. Ahh What a word, perception. To feel a shift in the perspective of your own perception, whether artificially induced or what have you, is a beautiful thing; a thing that has begun to take hold within my own mind. 

I first felt something had changed within my conscious mind a few years ago, at first, unaware of a change at all. When I did finally become keen to its existence, it became something I like to think of as a sudden realization of an undeniable inner truth. Mary had changed my thought process. It had provided me an inspiring medium through which the limits appeared to be ever expanding.

Through this expansion, to “just be” is something that is seldom practiced even at its highest frequency. What I mean by “just being” is more complicated than it may sound. When I go about my day, to class, to my job, or to do whatever I need to do to make my societal world go round, I’m conscious, but I’m not **just being**. I have a task at hand, not exploring

Then, it slides lightly over a mountainous terrain. Some of the expanse is familiar, and some is dazzlingly novel. I slip deeper into my mind, but suddenly I snap out of it. Whoa. At first I didn’t think about what had happened. What **HAD** happened anyways? Well, I like to believe that I was **just being**. It felt as if my entire rational thought process, which carried all of my everyday thoughts, concerns, desires

Since then I have had fleeting moments of clarity, *enlightenment*. The ability to transgress through the mind without a thought towards one’s own particular thoughts and desires, for me, has been the most breath-taking learning experience I could have ever hoped to have been given.

Our awareness of society is what allows society to exist. it is the true nature of the superorganism. Just as cells communicate through chemical means such as building proteins to cooperate, science and language. the shared knowledge belongs to everyone and can be traced back to its source.

the question ""what was the first idea"" is analagous to ""what was the first self-replicating molecule"" or maybe ""what was the first thing that was alive?"" when we consider the dawn of the superorganism

Ideas or memes are the shared information that enables the collective organism

This process of further levels of shared information can continue. Eventually an entire species can be considered one being, for lack of a better term, will begin to exchange information between them. The information exchange will begin on the next higher type of information beyond genes and memes, let's say ""meta-ideas"". meta ideas are something we cannot yet comprehend, and may be unable to comprehend as individuals, but are something that is inherent to the nature of the superbeing. genetic-memetic-supermemetic information exchange enables the next higher level of collective life to begin; the biosphere or all life in a given area of space that is capable of interaction. It may be that life arises independently elsewhere in the universe, and that life will too evolve to the biosphere unit of collectivity. Eventually, it will be a further level of information exchange. There may be levels beyond this, then multiple possibilities must exist at once.

As a fairly liberal (albeit not as liberal as some redditors, Locke, Kant, Thoreau, and so forth, all of whom are famous for writing on somewhat different topics. 

And yet, and yet I view this as a reason why individuals should strive to achieve their full potential. It seems as if people (who use mind altering drugs) commonly come to two different conclusions with the logic behind ""You only live once."" They will only come to one of these two, and which one it is usually depends on the personality. The first, and most reckless, is that you should simply live life without any regrets, and thus enjoy whatever drugs you wish and whatever amount. The second is that drug use actually enhances your abilities to deal with the problems in life (but my problem with that is that you're no longer achieving your true potential, just some artificial temporary potential created through drug use).

I suppose I can come off as somewhat radical in my views. I will admit I even don't really enjoy alcohol either. I even try to stay away from cold medicine when possible. I believe the human mind is a wonderful thing, it will still be changed as a result of this influence.

Every time you fall asleep at night you will be a different person than who you were in the morning

And yet the use of drugs is both mind altering temporarily but is *proven* to have a long-lasting, and it was very clear they were. And because of this, they acted like stoners, and they never truly reached their potential in life. I do not mean from a financial point of view, but from a point of view of success (the definition of which I could write an equally long thread about, but just know that success only partially includes finances in my eyes). While they did receive a certain happiness (both temporary and long lasting) from drugs, it seemed reckless to me in that they were limiting their ability to be fulfilled later in life, not how their circumstances forced them to live).

I disagree.  I imagine that consiousness and intelligence is the result of the nature of a single sub-particle somewhere deeper than even quirks or quarks.

Let us suspend disbelief for a moment

1)  The universe mirrors itself at all scales, atomic particles and sub-atomic particles are really no different than universes, galaxies, planets and stars.  It's all the same thing, yet seemingly different because we are part of the universe, looking back at itself, and marvelling at the complexity, and unending beauty that is our existence.

2) We are made up of clusters of particles ourselves.  Every body part, or sub-atomic particles which are responsible for the existence of consciousness.   As you go deeper, you are shedding layers of abstraction, until you come to a point where consciousness, intelligence, self- awareness are defined by a single particle.  I imagine that this particle is what we may be referring to as ""the God particle"".

3) With this in mind

4) The conscious particle is not designed, all the same but different.  No matter what other intelligence we meet, whether they be aliens from a distant star, or beings from another dimension or plane of existence, we will have at least one thing in common, otherwise we would not be aware of each other's existence, or be able to communicate.  If we have something in common, deep down

5) That one thing that we share, but unless those worlds include some kind of ""life form"" to learn from, to interact with; and to give us some distraction from the world, we will eventually get bored.  We will keep trying to dig deeper, or look farther.  We are hoping, praying, and performing science all with the same intentions, or greater than us

6) The more we are aware of ourselves, and community without the need to concern yourself with truth.  Truth, that when truly realized (that we are truly alone), would put us in terminal dispair.

7) Consciousness comes down to a single, what we call love.  Without love, we have no reason to exist, to carry on, to move forward.  We still don't have some ultimate purpose in the grander scheme of things, but if you've mananged to find love in this world, however fleeting.. cherish it.  Remember it.  Encourage it.  It is truly the only real purpose of existence.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/kc4ez/consciousness_is_a_lonely_particle/
1306706605.0,hn1yy,Are we (humans) the orcs? ,UnnamedGnome,23,7,13,"Consider this:

Elves are small in stature, nature, art, and philosophy. They're very peaceful, hurting other creatures only in self-defense. 

Orcs are large, killing things, and having a rowdy good time in the process. They're cruel and violent.


There's an example in the real world of this: bonobos are smaller and weaker than chimpanzees, and have casual sex to reinforce social bonds, sometimes orally. Bonobos eat meat only rarely, primarily feeding on fruit and stuff. Chimpanzees are brutes that wage wars with other tribes, regularly kill for meat, and are generally ... orcish in nature. That makes bonobos the elves. Bonobos are almost extinct, and chimpanzees are very numerous

Does this theme occur more frequently? Why is the elf-orc dichotomy so prevalent in stories and cultures today? Although I'm less informed about other world cultures

I posit the following:

A population of neanderthals lived in what would become europe towards the end of the last major ice age. As the winters warmed and food supplies grew, and more vicious than the neanderthals. They used powerful spears to kill big game, and were driven to the cold north by rival tribes in the south. Arriving at their new home, they were displeased to find this weak and despicable race living there, claiming they'd ""been there since the world was thawed by the licking of the great mother cow"". What a bunch of bull! The newcomers raped and killed the smaller hominids, who were unused to war and the advanced weapons of their attackers.

Who were those newcomers in this allegory? Modern man.

Look at our society today. Would you not say that we, the idea makes sense: elf-type hominids wouldn't stand a chance against orc-types (except for magic, which unfortunately doesn't exist). We can even see the process repeating itself in the world of apes today, so it's definitely not far-fetched.

Perhaps the appeal that elves have to our imagination are echoes of the 2% or so of our DNA that we've inherited from the neanderthals. Perhaps that's the magic they rely on in our stories. Perhaps that's why they're immortal.

The egg needs to be suspended on superconducting magnets so as to facilitate absolute reduction in friction when making turns while walking.  The egg needs to sense the directional pressure of your feet and weight distribution

Wild creatures like bandicoots and echidnas would dig up her garden time and time again for grubs and ants and sweet roots, but she never laid traps or made an attempt to keep the beasts at bay. In her eyes, we were on their land; they didn't understand ownership or property boundaries, they understood hunger and survival and who was she to get in the way of them trying to feed their offspring? In my mother's eyes, they were only doing the same as her.     

We always had plenty of vegies, potatoes, carrots, corn, tomatoes, cauliflower and broccoli... All the staples. Fruit was a little trickier to cultivate but we had guavas and mandarins and lemons and even some wild berries. Fruit was picked fresh from the tree and eaten, and to this day I miss picking mulberries from the bush

For meat we had pigs and chickens and of course the chickens provided us with eggs as well. Whenever an animal was killed, ready to fertilize the next crop that was planted in that spot. From the crop that was planted there, and indeed, the rest of the garden, the pigs and chickens got the scraps. Vegetable peelings and fruit that had fallen from the trees went back in to feed the animals who in turn fed our garden and fed us. Egg shells were crushed into grit for the chickens to get calcium and continue making the bright orange yolked, strong shelled eggs they produced and which we loved. Every part of the animals were used, even the bones were given to our dogs, and we used our time and effort to makes sure that the animals and plants were kept fed and healthy


I know this is long, that cycle. We don't need to waste and we don't need to squander. If we live more in tune with the cycle around us, our planet would be a healthier place, and I believe people would be much more aware of the way that their actions affect others, when you can see such a blatant example right in front of you every day.

In a darkened room lay a man. It could be called neither darkened nor a room, likewise the man was not a man, as a dolphin is not a man. ‘He’ had consciousness, like a dolphin does, incomparable to that of man’s. ‘His’ consciousness was as incomparable to a man’s as a man is to a stone. This not-a-man had never thought… until now and suddenly streams of awareness burst into his new-born mind. After an unknowable while he managed to control these thoughts and gradually formed an image. It burst forth into something so complex and incomprehensible that those that would eventually come to inhabit it would devote their entire existence in the hope of understanding it in some small way. He was content to watch, knowing all contained within, though not what would be, things happened unexpectedly, draining almost all his mind. After the longest time, but at last he was ready to try again. At first all was good

With time he decided to examine what was going wrong, when he had the mind power again, he did not create anything new, instead he looked back and combed over every detail of his former failures. Every one had a mistake, a point of no return, when his life would spawn forth more life, tiny compared to him. But eventually they would sap parts of his consciousness into their own. Soon his mind could take no more being divided into trillions upon trillions of tiny minds, the consciousness needed to sustain it contained within it

With sadness the not-a-man pondered the fate of them all. Without an overall watcher

For the longest time he did not create any new universes, only observe as they all melted into inexistence, a great void that even he could not begin to understand. Then a realisation grew on him. They would all eventually lose control and die off, but who was he to deny their short existence? It was a flaw in his design, all his universes would eventually create life, and the life would eventually destroy them but what else could he do? He thought of his own existence and soon decided that all he was here for was to create things in his mind, and to not do so would be denying not only his own existence but the unfathomable others he would, created. With great excitement the not-a-man begun to craft his next Universe.

All the sudden i had this tremendous epiphany than I truly existed...perhaps the first time i felt hyper consciousness if you will. In a way an out of body experience. I am here. I am alive. I exist.

This was profound and beautiful in a way but it quickly triggered a pretty severe panic attack...i should note i suffered from anxiety thinking about the universe


The next day i awoke with severe depersonalization/dissassociation which i know understand is a defense mechanism against stress/anxiety. I suffered a number of panic attacks over the next few weeks and general anxiety
I have since made great progress but still have a ways to go. Anxiety and depersonalization have subsided for the most part, single, unemployed ect).


My question is this. Did i uncover a rabbit hole by truly realizing and grasping consciousness or was that just a trigger of my predisposition to anxiety?

I would say that conclusions can be made for their own sake in this way too though - for example, in my opinion. Which more often than not means that their emotions will make the judgement calls, since their rationality is sitting out the match. Judgements can still be made about right and wrong while understanding their underlying deceivingly complex and mis-understandable nature.

1302025599.0,gj8xw,Cosmology of Vibration (everything is made up of vibrating energy),LeJavier,17,2,4,"I originally posted this on /r/philosophy

I'm going to take you inside matter, and take a look at the different religious philosophies of life, and connect it all to what we're doing right now - the present moment. And that's what it's all about.

===== The Cosmology of Vibration =====

PART 1: THE MATERIAL

Look around the room you’re in right now. Everything you see, which combine in different ways to form the several dozen atoms that make up our universe. 

In between these atoms and subatomic particles is [huge amounts of space]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kypne21A0R4), repel one another to give us the illusion of matter. Objects in the world don’t actually touch each other. The electrons in your hands are repelling the electrons in the keyboard, similar to the way magnets repel one another. We conceptualize of electrons as traveling in orbits, but we know that’s [not really true]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital). 

Going further in,” meaning they aren’t themselves made up of anything further, but that’s probably not true. We used to think atoms were elementary. 

As we travel further and further inside matter, creating what we believe is matter. This makes sense, since matter and energy are [interchangeable]( http://www.deism.com/images/einfun.jpg). And this completes the illusion of our physical world.

But matter isn’t the only thing that can be described by vibrations. Light and magnetism are of course [waves of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation)

Thus

PART 2: THE NON-MATERIAL

Now that we look at the universe through this lens

The Abrahamic traditions (Judaism, mainly) are so grouped not just because they share Abraham as their spiritual grandfather, but because aside from some small (and admittedly key) details, they all worship an [essentially similar God]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_conceptions_of_God). This God is described as being eternal, omniscient, omnipresent, indivisible,” unknowable, can be communicated with – each religion disagrees on how

The Indian religions (namely Hinduism, deities, prophets, and saints – but at its core, Hinduism is less about the worship of particular deities and more about the [practice of worship]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindusim#Beliefs) itself. It’s not uncommon in India (I’ve been lucky enough to travel there) to find shrines of Jesus or Mary next to shrines of Ganesh. And even so, Hinduism features Krishna as its principal creator. Krishna has a universal form which is everything and nothing, he is omnipotent and omniscient, to symbolize this omnipresence. 

Jainism and Buddhism share the core idea of a soul, but they agree that such a state exists – and that enlightenment is the realization of becoming one with the universe (Nirvana in Buddhism), which can be achieved during life – it’s not an afterlife. 

Finally, Shinto, and others) are all centered around the idea of the Tao. To try to describe the Tao, they believe, is pointless (just try out [/r/Taoism]( http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/) for yourself), and you have to describe *around* it to get it. The Tao cannot be known, only understood. At that point, and that is when you realize your essential part in the one-ness of the universe as a whole.

To me, and belief systems (it’s these culturally subjective values which form the different religions in the first place) and attempting, I believe, to arrive at essentially the same idea: the full and real understanding of the universe, including you, as being one vibration of energy. Of course the western religions, growing out of Aristotle’s subject/object dualism, apart from yourself

The realization of this singularity of vibration is what some call enlightenment.

PART 3: EVERYTHING ELSE

Now that we have those ideas unified, the ethical standard that I think no one would really disagree with, and which is present in almost every single belief system and even rule of law around the world, is obvious when you consider that we are all varying expressions of this vibrating energy. You have to treat others as you would want to be treated, because in a way, you *are* others. You are treating yourself; or, more accurately

Most qualities we prize in people - generosity, charisma - we prize because they are inclusive and shy away from the idea of being ""separate."" Those qualities we shun - greed, pride, dishonesty, rudeness - these things are exclusive, and encourage the ""me vs. you"" subject/object dualism.

Art is a debate in itself, and not a communication, then it's an experience of momentary realization of this singularity.

Even most good advice we receive, live in the moment, *Carpe Diem*, simplicity is better - all these ideas have been around for thousands of years, and all universal stories come derive their themes from these basic ideas. 

And all of them, the greatest homage, the finest dissection of our world is having your mind open to the present moment, understanding what you are and opening yourself to the chaotic nature of the vibrating universe.",,False,,False,t3_gj8xw

Most likely right? What about a butterfly or an ant? Most would probably say no. Why? Because they are more automated and they don't think.... right? Most would say an ants life is just a series of chemical reactions. But what about us? Are we any different? We make descisions based on calculations. So if we cross a street our brain can figure out exactly when its safe based on several factors. We eat because we are drawn to pleasure just like an ant is drawn to a trail of pheromones. This is how all of our actions work. Our brain anylizes the environment and ""we"" calculate the positive and negative outcomes and our brain or you makes a decision.
How is that any different than an insect? Its all just percentages
I'm going to get to the point but here's a thought experiment. Imagine you're an alien and as such time goes by 1000 times faster for you. You visit Earth for the first time and decide to watch the people from the sky. You'll see what looks like bacteria or ants building structures and growing just like mold. Wtf is that? You zoom in and these growths (cities) contain individual cells. These cells seem extremely advanced until you realize they contain many hundreds of millions of cells. And these cells even have structures. And if you look at the big cells (People) you'll see predictable reactions. Car crash? Specialized cell takes victim to be repaired. Look at blood cells and its the same. A group of cells doing its job. What about the inner workings of a our cells? The nucleus makes decisions based soley on chemicals and percentages and such. But what about the molecules of this nucleus? If a certain chemical is introduced a predictable outcome happens. Inside these molecules are waves of probability that I only understand the basics of. You can make a prediction and based on our sciences certain reactions will ocur. Kind of like the ambulance example I gave rigjt? Just much less variance.
So what you have is a series of reactions that get less and less predictable as the system gets more and more complex. So why should chemicals interacting be considered consciousness just because we are at the top level and predictability is low? Does this make any sense? You would probably define conscioussness as being aware of oneself but isn't our brain just complicated enough that we can put ourselves in a series of possible future outcomes and we have the computing power to do it the best of any other species. But at the end its just chemicals and probabilities. Just a bigger scale.
So either everthing and every piece of matter is conscioss because like we experience it ( obviously without emotions or any bodily actions ) or nothing is. Well I know I'm conscience so my conclusion is any and all matter has a consciousness to it.
This idea came somewhat from ego loss stories and other trip reports. Im not sure how much I buy into it though because I think we have soul or spirit and that this fits into my worldview nicely but I digress.

1335560344.0,svv5r,Which dimension is consciousness in?,f4f5,17,3,9,"*~Last night my friends got high

Have you seen the 10th dimension explained video? Well
&gt;“which dimension is consciousness in? or

My answer is consciousness is the 4th dimension. It fits the description perfectly.

**Reason 1:** 

-Objects in the 2nd dimension create a 1 dimensional shadow (imagine shining a light on perfectly flat circle. On the ground there’d be a 1 dimensional line. 

-3 dimensional objects create a 2d shadow. 

-Following that logic 4 dimensional objects create 3d shadows. Flinn explains it best [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTfJifUqq54) 

**Reason 2:** 

-The 2nd dimension is a 1 dimensional object perpendicular to the 1st dimension, right); (top, bottom). 

-The 3rd dimension is a 2 dimensional object perpendicular to both the 1st and the second. However, right);(top, bottom);(in, out). 

(Note at this point you have to start imagining real objects you can touch and hold

-The fourth dimension

However

**Here comes my idea:**
 
Each time you step into another dimension you rip a hole in the one you’re currently in. To imagine a 4d object you’d have to rip a hole in the 3rd dimension. That is

I still don’t know where and how “time” fits into all of this. Maybe we could have something like a conscious-time alternative to space-time; or both. Or maybe time is completely outside any dimension. Maybe it’s the canvas on which dimensions are painted. Maybe it’s the ink.
I have more ideas about the higher dimensions but this post is long enough so I’ll leave it at that. So
________
**TL;DR:** sorry no easy way to sum this up. Stop being lazy
_________
**Aside:** Where do ideas come from? How responsible are you for even your own ideas? Neuroscience has [shown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ4nwTTmcgs) that we make decisions way before we realize it. Maybe these ideas and decisions are made in the higher dimensions 5

Through advances in science we have shown that humans and everything else on Earth is made of smaller and smaller particles until we get down to the atomic level. From there humans can't really discern a smaller piece, the idea is that everything that exists is in 12 dimensions...thats right, 12. To think about it better, 2D is what you can draw on paper, 3D is what you can see in 3-D (what we see), and from there things get complicated. Basically, time is one of the dimensions and then all of the rest are somehow folds of previous dimensions moving around

Now, affecting things that happen in 2D, 3D, 4D(time), etc. without physically being seen (the same as the way you cannot 'see' time).

The brutal, dark side. Envision the amazing hostility of the far side. A place where the sun will never shine and our kind has never set foot on. Beyond the already astounding horizon of a dead face of a dead satellite lies an even greater expanse. The incredible distances of further celestial bodies is overwhelming. However, this is just where it starts. Our solar system is more-or-less known and well studied, but beyond it's bonds lies a colossal range of interstellar neighbourhoods.
 
There are literally dozens if not hundreds of similar systems in a currently unreachable distance from our home world. These are all contained in the Milky Way galaxy, maybe thrice the number of stars and planets. Even the numerically ridiculous galactic group is just an insignificant spot on the Virgo supercluster. We could continue my journey even further, but already I am amazed and intrigued by my meaningless in the face of the monstrous known universe. I exponentially accelerated my rise but I stupidly underestimated the cosmos. 
 
Even more horrifying is that my voyage was purely in space and excluded time. Time is unthinkably more mysterious, beings, spirits, molecules, elements, atoms in our universe. My humble human mind can't imagine or handle the variations, contrasts and expressions of all that existed and exists. 
 
Nothing truly changes. Nothing is ever truly erased or truly created. Everything changes, lifeless matter. But this dust will not stay in that state. It will collapse and eventually burn when our Sun shall evolve into a red giant and consume our world. The dust will remain in space and will be driven by time. One day(figuratively, as a solar day is utterly insignificant in cosmic-grade time) I may escape the binds of our dying sun and perhaps participate in the creation of something purely new.

For Christmas, designer clothes, concert tickets, perfumes and colognes, trips across oceans... we've been groomed by profit since the day we were born. So now what's going to happen? 


I think our generation may be lacking the same drive that our parents' one had, and how easy it is for us to do whatever we want with it. We know what it's like to live comfortably. But we don't want easy; we've seen what greed and capitalism has done to the world. As I type this, there are unspeakable tragedies forking away at nations on the other side of the planet-- so how can this be the ""good life"" if there are so many people suffering? Our drive isn't to achieve beyond monetary measure anymore. Our drive stems from our need to figure out what our **own** idea of the ""good life"" is. It isn't universal. We're individuals, we have different dreams. What the ""good life"" can offer us is different for every person. So now we're embarking on this thing called ""life"", where we have the opportunity and the resources to *actually* **chase** after our dreams. 

At the end of the day, I know if it ever came down to it, they'd lend me money to support me on whatever it is I may try to do with my life. This is how we're most fortunate. 

I explain go my parents everyday that living doesn't mean working another day, with your senses wide open; learning, feeling, and celebrating. Now that they've embraced it and understand, I encourage you all to do the same. Fuck that business/econ/engineering degree if it's not what you want to do. There's so much more for everyone out there.

If faster than light travel is discovered to be possible after the technological singularity then we could consume the cosmos at an unimaginable speed and that could explain why we're alone

We don't see any alien civilizations because a sufficiently advanced civilization could create their own universes in black holes/ travel to other earlier universes that couldn't possibly contain hostile competition.

**Theory 3:**

A multiverse could exist inside an ultracomputer constructed out of the fabric of space time in a universe that has long ago undergone entropy death.

Another way to think about the 4 dimensions is that they are the minimum amount of data you need to *coexist* with another object in space-time, do we? We're just the same old atoms. Technically all the atoms in me have and will coexist with Larry's atoms for all of time. Why make the distinction at the level of a person or a rabbit or a clock? We are all just atoms, grouping together differently over time. And if all atoms that exist have always and will always exist, then all this careful measurement of time that we're doing, like trying to pinpoint *when* the Big Bang occurred, is meaningless to the universe. Because time doesn't matter to.. *matter itself*.

1329099498.0,pmuq0,Proof that life does not exist.,IFUCKINGLOVEMETH,14,1,21,"Life cannot be defined. Therefore

Don't believe me that life cannot be defined? Sure, but there is no universal definition that makes sense in all cases.

Is life organic? Not necessarily. There are conceivably lifeforms which are not carbon based. Organic = carbon based. So being organic is not a fundamental requirement of life

What about self-replication? That seems pretty basic. But what if we can create Artificial Intelligence. Wouldn't that count as life? If we could create a being that could experience the full range of human emotions, wouldn't necessarily be a self-replicating. Therefore, even self-replication cannot define life.

Consciousness? Intelligence? Well

It appears that life can have many definitions. Which means it is undefined. That's what happens when you divide by zero. You get many definitions

Life, depending on the context. We sort of have this feeling that there's only one definition of life. But that's false.

What happened is that we came up with the word ""life"" to explain our conscious experience of the universe. Death was the lack of that conscious experience. But then we decided that animals have life too, and eventually decay. Even lower animals that don't have a conscious experience of the universe seem to decay. So we kept going, trying to cling on to the word life. We threw in terms like self-replication so that we could try to make sense of the word we invented. But the word life never really meant anything other than our conscious experience of the world. So by the time we got down to carbon atoms (organic chemistry), we sort of figured out that life doesn't have a definition. 

Even if life just means the basic ability to interact

 Life appears simply to be the constant struggle between two states. The two basic states being positive and negative. Yes or No. 1 or 0. On or off. Light or dark. Buddhists and Taoists recognize this is the fundamental nature of the universe and of life.

_________________________________

Why would anybody want to be inferior at something? Personally I hate the fact that my eyesight is less than perfect. I'd do anything to have perfect eyes again. I often get jealous of others with perfect vision. It seems like much of what you are comes down to luck. The rich and successful aren't anything other than temporary objects forged by complex chemistry. Everything you see around you is flowing along in a path of least resistance... even the tough decisions you have to make are done because they're the easiest possible thing for you to do at the time. 

So there are no real choices. You're not a creature capable of choice. 

Then you wake up and realize that there are many others like yourself who are just a little bit luckier. They're still human like you, but they're not you. They're smarter, better, richer, stronger, and more fortunate than you. You begin the realize just how much you lack in the categories you admire and you wish you were them. You wish you were them so badly that you begin to hate yourself. You hate yourself because you realize that the way you were put together is less than optimal and thus you are doomed a life of undue discomfort. 

Great job. You won the genetic lottery to exist

So now what? Perhaps we should end ourselves and quietly fade away. Leave science to find ways to allow parents to make children with ideal traits better suited for the modern world. After all why would you want to be inferior when you can be a genius? Or perhaps we should suffer with ourselves until death beckons us to enter the void. Perhaps we hear death's voice already ringing in our ears giving us the confidence to cross over. 

Finally. You realize the hopelessness of your situation and you welcome death. You were born without memory and you'll die without memory.

Can anything in a universe made up by laws and forces really be ""free""? 
Maybe it is the illusion of our brains

I digress, come and join me. Here goes:

The definition of free will as stated, death, despair and bloodshed forever. Man does not need to fight, outside of borders nor within. We can ""choose"" to be happy. But here's the kicker, if it is a choice to abandon feelings, then we have abandoned choice. Which per definition makes us bound, shackled to an eternal grin. You might argue ""So evil is just a choice, sadly enough
Therefore we have settled, not ever reaching the light. 
But what has happened in today's world is that some people still believe that we can be eternally blissful. So they built walls, for the right of peace and freedom. Their peace and freedom. ""The selfish gene"" is born again. 
And what has happened can be seen from everywhere. People scribbling on the edge of train carts, crying out that they are trapped in a system that they do not know the way out of. And what happens is fear, despair, depression, apathy, addiction, greed

But somehow the illusion of free will exists within us. Have we adapted or are we waiting for a parallax to take place?

&gt;""All explorers are seeking something they have lost. It is seldom that they find it
-- Arthur C. Clarke

Are you okay with the prospect of a journey that lacks any real destination?

According to the evidence I've managed to gather in my humble nineteen years, either. That was the point, wasn't it? The pointlessness? 

We just wanted to experience what was around the next corner. The world would show us. We didn't need a master plan.

But we happen to be conscious, anyway? Why remember? Why grow? Is there a higher purpose we are growing into? Can we fail to meet it? I'm not sure if there could be more natural bursts of critical thought. But consider:

What if the ultimate higher purpose is no purpose at all? Is not the most all-encompassing purpose the lack of one entirely?

I do not mean to imply a perpetual quest. That's no more a quest than an endless moment is a moment. But what better way for a plant to serve the soil from whence it came than to eventually cripple and decay, as well?


Are you okay with being temporary?

My describing The Empyrean as a story is accurate from my viewpoint, though it is one to me. Being that it takes place in the mind of one person, no laws of time and space, or concrete relationships exist therein. This is to say that if you look into it with your logical brain you will only strain yourself and come up with nothing. The words were specifically written to document an inner experience of life, the kind that a person has extreme difficulty translating to anyone else. Part of the intention was to write words to connect with other people who have been, or are, overwhelmed by the confusing, and their sub-conscience, and so I recommend hearing or reading it however you will.

There are a lot of hard questions that just cannot conceivably be answered by man about the universe we live in. Why is everything the way it is? Why does is seem that everything seems to work out perfectly for our existence? If only a couple of tweaks were made to the fundamental processes that govern how all matter and energy interact

So that brings me back to the previous question. Why is everything the way it is? I feel like you have to reword the question to get more insight into it. Not why

You have to be able to ask, but more so we are trying to understand everything that is possible about what we are experiencing. 

Can this question not hold true about the universe itself. Could it not itself be one ""entity"" just trying to figure out what it is itself. If you look at the timeline of stars, they get to a point in life that is prime for life on orbiting planets, then they die. But not all die in the fizzle out method. Some die and end in the glory of a black hole. There is so much beauty and mystique in black holes. Is it possible, just by the smallest fraction that black holes are just tools used by the universe(or multiverse) in order to rearrange and store information in another place? If black hole and white hole coupling is indeed true, then i would have to argue on that behalf. For what better way is there for data storage for a scale such as the universe. 

Could all this be just the universe using everything that it has in order to better understand it self? I for one would much like to think so.

We are wrong. We are just completely wrong in every conceivable dimension and direction. 
Let start from the beginning of science.
What is ""science""?
It's derived from the word 'knowledge' from the greek as far as I can remember and it constitutes the knowledge we have acclaimed about our universe and our place within it. Now please don't get me wrong
Let's start with the first step of exploring from science point of view: measurements. 
We measure reality and come up with facts about it that supports it. It can be anything from a simple area
It's like saying 2+3-5=0. This does not tell us anything about any other number than 2, due to mathematical logic, we can derive other ""truths"" from this. I do not believe that reality works in the same manner. 
 
Now
And what says that we are valid? Well

Let's explore the Planck length
Now, this equation:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length
This
For what says that anything really is measurable? What says that distance in the first place is a real phenomena? What says that any measurement is ""real"". 

Put it this way: 
Regardless how you measure a circle and in what unit you measure it in you will ALWAYS come up with Pi in some way. And Pi will ALWAYS have the same value. We may be alone in counting in base 10 which means that Pi might look differently in other math-standards but it will always be the exact same value. 
Does this value exist? Is it really irrational? Is it even a number? 
I would say not
That equation is not real, but they are not there in the way that we currently imagine them to be.
This goes for Phi, Tau, and really any other constant you can think of. 

What I think is interesting is that our math converges on specific numbers
But because we have a deep rooted desire of measuring (our inability to accept that things simply do not have meaning) some of these values simply ""falls out"" of our own equations, but that doesn't matter or mean anything. It's just for our own sake. 
It's like saying 5 divided by 5 is 1 and therefore we have discovered something new about the number 5. But since the number 5 does not exist the sentence ""discovered something new about number x"" is totally meaningless unless it's in its own frame of reference. 

TL;DR
I don't want to simplify this

Thank you, but until you prove me otherwise I will believe that I am right. About the fact that we are wrong. Which doesn't even make sense. Fuck this, I need my joint. 

Peace and fucking love.

But tonight's meditation was very profound. I reconciled my tautology with my humanistic morality! So I will devote a few sentences to describing that. When I subscribe to my morality, and self-propagates, and occasionally has sentience. The second argument is that God created it. Just kidding. The second is that goodness in life is directly related to appreciation of existence. This can be on a large or small scale, and entails awareness, understanding, and love of this aforementioned existence that we all share. I think that's what happiness is.

So what can I derive from that? A good deed is one which helps a living being to appreciate existence or some part of it. A bad deed is that which works against appreciation, or love. Lying, cheating, theft, murder, hatred; all bad. Note that you can commit good and bad deeds to yourself.

Think of it as a video game. You play the campaign through 1 of maybe 3 or 4 characters. You choose the one that best suits you.

You can either rule the whole world, or just live as a peaceful farmer in the countryside, it's all your choice. Eventually the game will end. You will get your stats at the end, showing how happy you are, how happy you made the other people, and so on. What you didn't realize is that there is a little surprise at the end of the game. If you played with an overall negative score, if you finish the game with a positive score, literally anything.

That's how life is. You could do whatever you want, but at the end it all depends on your score.

**Snack White**

I was at a swimming pool in an experimental mental hospital (it was a rather long dream that didn't begin at this point

After swimming, though he wasn't there for some reason. 

On the old CRT television (security monitor?) was musician Jack White from The White Stripes swimming

After a short moment, non-screechy emo voice I can still hear. It didn't sound anything like his normal voice. Just a dull, flat style... almost as if he was bored.

I can't remember the line

The camera was very close up and graphic. But he lasted quite a while. Singing for at least a minute. No sounds or other obvious expressions of physical pain. The croc was strangely calm

 It started off with him sort of kneeling down in the croc's mouth, and the only thing visible was his head and upper torso, as if he was trying to crawl out of the croc's throat. Though he obviously wasn't trying. 

Clearly this was some kind of weird suicidal performance art.

He was singing until the very end. Finally the croc began crunching him for good. While bringing him underwater (which the camera followed).  I couldn't tell if he was dead before he was finally swallowed

It was all extremely graphic and seemed very realistic. Though I've never seen anything like that in real life.

Suddenly and without any explanation, nothing of any significance to report. They were just showing boring, normal traffic for some reason. And without any mention of the suicide footage we had just seen.

While watching the suicide song, after the feed suddenly and jarringly cut to the traffic without any explanation -- that is the part that disturbed me most of all. That's when the person next to me and I started squeezing each other real tight.

His haunting voice singing the end of that stanza kept repeating in my mind for a few seconds as we squeezed eachother in increasing terror until I woke up.

Enter Westboro Baptist Church.  A group built on vile rhetoric and the Christian Bible.  The distressed atheist part of me wants to chalk their actions up to a lack of critical thinking and upbringing, ""Watchmen"" and the recent Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight.""

In ""Watchmen"" the character Ozymandias, sees a problem in world similar to one the one addressed here.  He sees a world that needs uniting, echoing the aspirations of his hero Alexander the Great.  His solution is an engineered set of events that would like an extraterrestrial invasion that kills millions, thus creating a world-wide catastrophe uniting all inhabiting Earth against a common enemy.  Perhaps extreme, and, luckily, only a story.  Batman has something in common with Ozymandias.

In the movie ""The Dark Knight"" we see this idea of uniting against a common enemy with one of the most quoted section towards the end of the film.  Batman is worried that a politician's ruined reputation will undue the good done by said politician.  Batman then decides to take on the sins of the politician; therefore

""God Hates Fags"" and ""God Hates Soldiers"" both seem like the close-minded rants of anger born of ignorance.  According to Occam's Razor

Westboro Baptist Church, but they are very cunning.  Much of what they say, no matter how horrible, is protected by the U.S. Constitution and safeguarded by the court system.  Time and time again people have tried to quiet the group, oftentimes resorting to less than legal means to do so.  Every time the group's civil rights are violated, they go to court.  They have members well versed in the U.S. Constitution and laws.  They utilize this knowledge in court winning case after case filling their coffers with the awards.  If they are smart enough to continually win in court, how smart are they really?  How could they be so intelligent and ignorant at the same time?  I realize one can be smart and ignorant at the same time and perhaps my questions beg more than a dog for bacon.  Due to the nature of the subreddit - they stand for the purpose of experimentation.

One more questionable question:  Is the Westboro Baptist Church working out of love or hatred?  Their actions and words reek of hatred.  They shout and sing things deemed unacceptable to the society that is home to the church. Yet they follow the Christian Bible to the word.  They are able to back up their beliefs with citations.  They do what they believe God has told them to do.  There is some contraindication between Westboro Baptist Church and what Jesus purportedly  preached to the masses.  How do they reconcile their words and those of Jesus?

What is the commonality between the KKK, religious groups from all major religions, veterans and every combination of those groups plus a few more to boot?  They have stood up against Westboro Baptist Church.  They have lined up in front of funerals and made public denouncements against the group.  These groups are united under a common enemy.  Through hatred, Westboro Baptist Church has brought unity.
 
Perhaps Westboro Baptist Church is the hero the USA deserves.  Perhaps they engineered themselves to be a giant space alien. It is entirely possible they are Socratic masterminds doomed to be hated for bringing light to a dark situation. Probably not

To facilitate these basic tasks

Spoken and written language has allowed us to communicate with an unprecedented degree of accuracy to our intended point. And the evolution of language has seen the growth of the exploitation of language - metaphors for example express concepts that ordinary language would find difficult despite expressing an specific felt mental/emotional state and/or aspect of specific material knowledge.

With this, and language facilitates the discussion of these abstract concepts (or perhaps made these abstract concepts of the mind possible in the first place, though I tend to believe it was the former).

As we have seen, only communicate basic ideas - danger, food, etc. - and there is no inherent ""meaning"" to language - animals without a spoken language can survive well enough without it. Animals lack the ability to communicate concepts as well as humans can with language.

But when does the soul actually form? If every sperm has a soul that means that most men produces and kills millions of souls every day. If they are complex in nature then the building process is complex. But isn't that too much of a waste if that was the case? Evolution wouldn't let that much potential just go to waste.

Let's introduce magic to the playing field; souls are pieces of the universes identity. Then do males practice magic every day by creating it? What if souls only form during the actual connection between the sperm and the egg? Would that mean that a test-tube baby has no soul? Are all ginger-kids actually test-tube babies? 
Could we extract the ""glands"" in humans that produces souls and then create super-souls?  Maybe that's how God was created. An ancient hyper-intelligent society who learned how to harness natures' own power of producing souls and created the ultimate soul, all harnessing the power to create a power grander than all else, to the point where the regression meets up with itself and bonds, thus meaning that we're creating ourselves. We, in our universe, in what we call ""the cosmos"" are the last link for that circle to be complete. Cause what happens when a society has the power to manufacture life? War happens.

The fullest amount of freedom has the same problem. Knowing that you're free is to know that your actions won't affect the person in any shape or form, it means that your connection with their being is as strong as the force that ties you with a planet orbiting any other star. Negligible. 

Yet we humans, swing back and forth like a pendulum. We want both the loyalty and the lack of responsibility. We want both their desperation and their ability to pursue their own fulfillment.

It can't be common sense. When was common sense ever the answer? The sense that is so common is the weakest compromise between both. People don't dare to love nor do they dare to let go.

There are some grim implications to this proposition, you could distill the bullet points from it and ask yourself, ""Does my loved one know that I think this highly of them?"" For example, if you think your best friend is a really good listener, would they know that?

Then, you could drop hits every now and then or randomly mention the compliment in passing. People tend to cling onto such poignant lauds, even if uttered in a casual manner, and they have the possibility of changing the whole dynamic of your relationship.

Perhaps this should be the real ""bucket list:"" drop hints to everybody you know about the high esteem you really hold them in.

So forget about your troubles around here because everything is imparmanent no matter how big are your problems or your fortune is

Obviously, there was an indescribable scene which was unspeakably familiar, kind of like the most intense deja vu possible, and I thought to myself, simply, ""Holy shit this is familiar"".

We think that as you move further away from earth we will eventually reach other galaxies etc. But in what direction are these? Is our solar system in the middle with thinks both above and below us as well as further away in a 2 dimensional sense? Do we orbit the sun flat? Do other planets orbit on a different axis? How have we been able to navigate to other planets if they do orbit on a different axis to us? 

I find the concept of the universe makes far more sense if it's actually 2  dimensional. Like if it was a cricket field and we are only able to move along the one plane (I think that is actually apart of a multiverse theory).

Side note: There is considered to be a ""Habitable"" zone in which the earth sits. With the Millions of other planets and stars out there odds are there must be another one with similar or the exact same conditions as earth. Does this mean that ""aliens"" could be genetically the same as us assuming they developed in the same conditions we did? Obviously they could be more or less evolved/technologically developed.

Since they think that the Sun is slowly shrinking could this mean that planets further out in our solar system were once in this zone? Maybe as it's shrunk Mar's was the last planet in this zone and this explains the ""riverbeds"" NASA has observed there. Could it have once been in the same condition as Earth but now is outside the zone.

1) Preface:

TL;DR *We had a lot of imaginary money during the housing bubble

As government aid programs stood at the turn of the century, meaning the government to fund the war?) tried to collect on those debts, there wasn't enough money to be had. Hence the economic crash when the housing bubble collapsed.

TL;DR: *we hosted ourselves by our own petards*

**2)** We had more money to spend from the bubble, money being in the hands of the needy is a good thing. People who need help get a hand up. The fact is that we increased funding to the social aid programs when we had wealth as a nation, and when the economic tide turned, people realized they could hook into the aid system to keep themselves well off financially. We need to find a way to scrap off the leeches while leaving those who truly need aid untouched.


TL;DR: *but by hoisting ourselves

**3)** Because we were absolutely saturated with imaginary money from the bubble, millions left unemployed. Then they get on social aid, which further exacerbates the economy's financial problems. We dug our own grave, spending monopoly money on nuclear weapons, the military, pipes to Alaska, I'm sure you can think of more. We collectively shot ourselves in the foot by overspending. So now our government is overextending itself to protect us

**4)** TL;DR: *Cut government spending? Yes we should

So, and if we can prop up a successful government in the Middle East, we can pull out and bring our troops home. Not to say that doing so is easy. Everything is intricately tangled. 

**5)** TL;DR: *Trying to solve these problems could destabilize the economy
Unfortunately, crashing things even further. 
The problem is exactly the same as the drug war problem. If we gave up and let all the marijuana-related ""criminals"" in jail to walk free

**6)** TL;DR: *We're eating our own tail
On the other hand, become chains, and employ more people. We'd have to return more of our jobs from overseas and tighten laws about international corporations hiring across borders, which the corporations will fight tooth and claw to keep, because it lets them stay rich and perpetuate the cycle, instead of tightening their belts like everyone else.

**7)** TL;DR: *So what now?*

What can we do about it? Individually, the  intelligent, the critical thinkers who may not have the best public face, we may have a chance. This is where Reddit comes in. A large portion of its demographic is those too young to vote, but close.

That the laws of physics are merely the lowest-grade dumb stuff, see here God, can you make anything cool out of *this* yucky goo? I mean, when you study physics seriously, zoom in to the real meat of the universe, delve in there by reduction, and when you get close enough and really see it for what it is — it's basically *nothingness*, beyond blackness or invisibility

We are supposed to believe that this autistic soup is the heart of reality,"" suggesting that any interesting *logos* here actually derives from the chaos, was always there from the start, a 180 degree reversal of the obviously true situation.

Namely that there must exist, a large and beautiful organization of the causal relations, which is so dynamic in every dimension that it (and perhaps only it) truly deserves the name ""True Life"", ""Soul"", or ""God."" This living meta-structure includes everything, is everything, is the creative drive in every process, the word made flesh.

What, that the only absolutely true perspective is that of Spinoza's pantheism, and that the Spinozan identification of God as the Constantly-Creating Creativity in Nature is truly another equally valid conception of true monotheism, and that devotion and love is a pre-made attractor in the Field of Excellence, that Virtue is Identifiable as Strong Loving Life, the completely serene life, absolutely harmonious, the bodhisattva life.

Our codified stale ethics are unnecessary, true justice, true love. This is why all great prophets are minimalists in ethics. They uncalcify, they cause withering trees to bloom. They bring peace and disruption: individual peace in the midst of social disruption. Nietzsche totally missed the arcane truth of Buddhism when he described the Buddha as a profet for a declining, decadent culture — or maybe we've missed the arcane truth of Nietzsche. He might have seen its Original Secret Plan, to install the trojan horse that keeps the truth alive, to bring God down through the darkening ages in a cloak of disguise

What, discerning, skillful, and careful as you? 
You do not think they created a soul science, self vs others? You really think the transmission of Dharma could be anything but a Significant Substructure in the Dynamically Perfect Web of Action and Thought, or a Truly Magnetic Love between the Reflective Mind and the Wonderful Workings? Nahh! You need to sit down and meditate!

Just do it

If you find a True Master to guide you, and with this you have a true guide to the Terrain of Transformation. The singular enlightenment is not an easy target, but you will find a true glimmer of hope in the feeling of Rising Soul, a trustily increasing Robustness of Divine Connection, a Higher Ground. This will be felt in your blood and deeply realized even when it is just that, a glimmer.

But to be just with Plato, a praise of Matter, a concealed praise of the Spirit behind Matter, the Spirit Coextensive With Matter, the Great Arbitrariness, the Hilarious Elegance. Yes indeed. Plato was a force of nature, and was never wrong; nobody is ever wrong, Truly, old Plato realized his True Nature and then only sang the Song of Dharma

You must realize that the Golden Dharma was Vividly Activated in the Birth-Miracles of both West and East. See, the Judas, the Desert Poverty, the Monastery, the Asceticism, the Cross. We must not blame the Bodhisattvas for the transience of their religions; there must be Calcification at some Radius of Multi-Dimensional Perfection. Bodhisattvas walk among you every day, all are prophets

So, I must implore you with the most Thundering Enthusiasm, that you Work-Up the Chops and Chutzpah to Truly Integrate, Concentrate, and Penetrate Truth. This cannot be done while the Glitzy Distortion of Softcore Pornography and Drugged Titillation is given your attention. You must make a Dharma Commitment to achieve Syrup-Level Concentration. Once this comes, you will not need further so-called External Encouragement; then ""Jesus takes the wheel.""

You must be ready to begin at the outset of this adventure. When you debark, where you Perfectly Realize that it was all Perfectly Alright when you began. Then the whole history and purpose of the universe will be Easier to Understand than a Simple Two-Plus-Two Type Equation. You will have tamed yourself, become yourself, forgotten yourself, and actualized your True Self. This is Truly Possible.

On another hand after i stopped laughing i realized that the reason why people are so ignorant to the truth on the topic of marijuana and it's uses/side effects is because of all these sites out there that the corporate community is putting out there as ""drug awareness"". what makes this so serious is to a less experienced person they go out there and read these sites and believe them which as someone with experience i know that its all about the expectation when using such mental tools so people out there have this propaganda ingrained in them since they were young schools etc. so yes while they still may try it possibly even a few times they are expecting bad or have the fear of having a bad experience and in turn this has pushed people away from it and strengthening their ignorant faith of the dangers of marijuana.

i guess the point i am trying to make is that marijuana is only illegal because the corporate world hates the idea of legalization and its because of all this blatantly obscure propaganda that sadly the current majority of the population voters believe it all.

Humans have created an eternal world with computers. 

With everything in life, as everything a human knows eventually changes. Computer parts and things that exist in the real world will naturally age and decay with time, but digitally - everything is everlasting. Everything you submit to the internet is everlasting unless changed by a program or another individual. This post itself after submission can only be affected by the outside world, computer programming inside of it, or an external moderator. If these things did not exist and if theoretically parts never decayed, the information would last endlessly.
