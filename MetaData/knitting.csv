We've been considering a user survey for some time now

The survey is meant to give us a better idea of how much our subscribers are reading /r/knitting, how they participate, and what their thoughts, opinions, and ideas are.  

I want to be clear, but it's hard to do when we don't know what y'all want.

The survey does ask you to provide your username.  Only one mod (me, your responses with usernames attached will ***not*** be shared with anyone.

The multiple choice/checkbox section of the survey can be completed in roughly five minutes, and what ideas you have for /r/knitting.  Because the responses will be de-identified, if you have any idea for some type of project that you'd like to organize but you need some assistance, consider message one or all of the mods - your survey responses will be de-identified, so we won't know who wanted to organize what...

In order to make it worth your while

This has taken me about a year--nine months of semi-steady knitting to make the monster, which you can find [here](http://www.newlanarkshop.co.uk/shop.php?view=product&amp;product=206) if you so wish--if you call them up, they can post you the cones.

Pattern was derived from a sewing one, I should warn you, do a gauge swatch! And do it well. I wound up having to trim loads of it off--waste of yarn, but I'm making it into pockets so it's turned out fine. The entire thing is in moss stitch, which I like because it's not too stretchy--would deeply not recommend garter stitch, as the weight of the cloak will likely stretch it out. I knitted it on a circular needle, using it as a very long straight one.

If you look at the sewing pattern, where r=radius=half the number of stitches you've cast on. To figure out where your decreases are, take the row you're on and figure out where that intersects with the semicircle equation. So, for instance, if you are on row 26, you can pop over to a graphing calculator or WolframAlpha or something and find the intersection of y=25 and y= √(r² - x²) to find the number of stitches in your current row, and compare it to the previous one to find out how many decreases you need to do.

I'm afraid I can't really remember how I managed to make the neckhole--similar process to above, I marked where the neck opening was meant to be and left some extra yarn so I could go back, cut it and weave in the ends.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense--if anyone wants to make one

After I finished that, as I couldn't be bothered to make the film-accurate hood. I made the mistake of not getting my gauge properly, so when I finished it was too big for me. I tried to rectify this by felting it slightly, which turned out to be a good thing as it is now a better texture and thicker. It took me about three runs through the hot-water-hot-dryer cycle to get it anywhere near felted, however--even now, it's not completely felted, as stitch definition is still clear. I still had to snip quite a lot of cloth off the bottom to get it to its current form and then hem it--apologies for the scalloped hem

Anyway, being wool, although I don't fancy risking it in the rain. If you have any questions, ask away!",,False,self,False,t3_17ffui

So first I started with just a basic beanie pattern I got from ravelry on US 6 double pointed needles. I worked bottom up

Then I made a band to go around the forehead and after lots of ribbiting got the shape I wanted for the top pieces. Here I used 6mm needles with worsted yarn. I sewed the pieces together and stuffed them (http://imgur.com/LR3dY). 

After I cleaned all that up and got the stuffing just right I worked on the next layer and the base for the beard. Everything but the beard was done on US 10 needles, but not too snug, fit for the chin area. Sorry about the duck face, the beard was loose so I was trying to hold it in place with my lip, and thus the unfortunate duck face (http://imgur.com/p1U8p) 

Now that that was done I had the wonderful job of looping and knotting long beard strands

The final stage was sewing in all the helmet details as accurately as possible. Hope this helps anyone looking to knit something similar (http://imgur.com/GNJKr).",self,t5_2qiu0,1359399302.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/16tyzr/my_friend_wanted_a_gimli_helmet_with_beard_so_i/

My best friend just had an adorable baby boy on May 26th. They live in England, knowing I won't get to see him until at least his first birthday. So I knew I wanted to make something really, really special for him, but I'd had knitter's block on what *exactly* I wanted to make starting sometime in February. The minute she texted me a picture of Baby Miles, I knew what I should make. This is the result! I'm SO pleased with how it turned out, and I know it will be that one blanket that he loves to death - which I am totally fine with. The more loved, the better! I hope r/knitting loves this blanket as much as I do!!

All of the patterns come from [Elaine Fitzpatrick](http://www.ravelry.com/designers/elaine-fitzpatrick) and are super easy and quick to knit up. She has cloth and bib patterns for everything I made here. One of my patients told me about her site. She's a genius!

I used [Martha Stewart Craft Yarn Extra Soft Wool Blend](http://marthastewart.lionbrand.com/marthaStewartCrafts/extrasoft.html)

The yarn is from another crafty girl and is the strong sock yarn in the custom Reddit colorway. I used the [planned pooling website](http://www.plannedpooling.com/?stitches=46&amp;Color_1=FA8D20&amp;Stitches_1=30&amp;Color_2=1E8DBD&amp;Stitches_2=43&amp;Color_3=42F0FC&amp;Stitches_3=23&amp;type=flat&amp;number_colors_input=3&amp;comment=&amp;old_n_colors=3) to come up with the scarf width after knitting a small swatch and determining the stitch counts for each color.

Here is the end result [Reddit Yarn Scarf](http://imgur.com/a/vs2ys)
I cast on 46 stitches using US10 needles and knit the first and last 3 stitches of each row to form the border. It blocked out to 65 inches long by 8.5"" wide

I'd blown through an entire season of Damages on the ipad Netflix. What's worse, it is chafed and raw. My fiancé had to put  ointment and a bandaid on my butt. I wish I were making this up.

A recent thread asked ""What do you value about r/knitting -- 

**and it was amazing how many people said ""the company!""**


I take back every time I've ever grumped about too many FO pics or newbie questions -- I had no idea so many people had noone to share with in real life.

**How many of us knit mostly alone in a bleak knitting desert?**  
**How many of us knit in an oasis with lots of fertile compnay?**

*Here's some of those eye-opening comments:*

""Here you have instant access to a wide range of knitters

""I was happy to find this place because I love knitting and lack a knitting community IRL. I don't have time (and a sitter to mind the kids) to haunt my LYS and my friends and neighbors have different hobbies.""  

""I love seeing FO's from other people

""I actually really love this sub reddit. I have always been sort of a lone(r) knitter with no one but FB and my friends who don't knit to share my triumphs with and now I have all of you!!""  

""I love how I can come here for help! No one that I personally know does magic loop or socks and I can ask before I mess a project up.""  

""The only real life knitters I know are all 65+ and have very different tastes than I do"" :)

And it feels weird, because people have died here.  

And four deaths feel pretty big
and at the same time pretty small compared to the amount of death happening in lots less quiet places like Iraq and Afghanistan

What's happening here is deep tragedy for a few

It's been a good day to just think, death, and boredom. If you google any one of those countries plus the word ""knitting"", you'll find images. There are pictures of soldiers knitting in trenches in each of the wars since photography came in, and written descriptions from the wars before that. 

There are stories of people's private little wars -- against cancer, the fight that it takes a mother to get a baby into the world, often comes with long boring waiting...and knitting.  

___


&gt;On the Western Front – when once you had accepted the fantastic conditions of it, of course, before a background of incessant fear or utter despair. In such leisure any man with a secret entertainment for himself which required no cumbersome equipment or instruments or tools, was lucky. A friend of mine, a great footballer and a very brilliant pianist took up – very seriously – knitting. His mother sent him a parcel of books, wool, and the measurements of his young sister who was still at school. Before he was killed he had completed and sent home a two-piece suit – skirt and jumper…

1358457295.0,16rvpc,Why I will definitely be ordering from Jimmy Beans Wool again,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,121,11,27,"This is long

A few weeks ago, and found myself on jimmybeanswool.com. I'd remembered recommendations from other to this sit, so I decided to see if they had the yarn I wanted. Surprise! They did, in the color I wanted. Even better, it was on sale. I immediately ordered a ball, happy to start lace knitting.

Unfortunately, and I wasn't mad. It gave me more time to finish the project I was currently working on, and I forgot about it quickly.


Strangely, so I didn't question it as I cast on for a pretty shawl I'd wanted to try. I was pleased with the speedy service, although it was a bit strange that it had taken only a few days for yarn to be sent back then reshipped to me.

A few days later, since I was still working on the shawl, so I figured that the email was sent to the wrong person. That is, until today, when I found another JBW package in my mail. I first thought it was for someone else had gotten their order mixed up with mine, so I didn't open the bag in case it needed to be sent back. Instead, I checked the order history on my account, I called the number on the site and was connected to customer service within a few minutes. I spoke with the woman for a few minutes

The person who got my order had sent it back to 
jbw, which was the one I got first, and the original ball, which I had just gotten. I asked if I should send it back and if I would be charged for it (my biggest concern, because although the yarn was lovely, I didn't want to spend my extra money on a ball I had gotten by accident). The customer service rep told me no, I didn't have to send it back and that it wouldn't be charged

In all, same color and style. The customer service was very helpful and it only too a few minutes to get everything sorted out. I was surprised that they let me keep the ball free of charge, and very pleased with the whole experience. Because of all of this, I can now definitely say that I will order more yarn from JimmyBeansWool in the future, thanks to their wonderful service and high-quality yarn.",,False,t5_2qiu0,True

Since there was interest in a Face Your Fears series

I know it's a busy knitting season right now

The topics will be (not in any particular order):

Steeking

Felting

Socks

DPNs/Circulars (try the one you *don't* prefer or have the most trouble with)

Entrelac

Fair Isle

Double Knitting

Cables

Lace

Different stitches

**ADDED**

Brioche

Short rows

Increases/decreases

Grafting

Colorwork

Sweaters/clothing

Knit-crochet fusion

***What's your opinion on novelty yarn?***


If there's any other knitting fear you may have and would like to see it on here, please please let us know. We're open to criticism and would love to hear it. 

Edit: Entrelac twice. Derp.

**Edit 2**

After seeing some suggestions from the survey

* A small selection of patterns (3-4) chosen by users that are very familiar with the topic.

* maybe an easy and an advanced recommended pattern

* Regarding allotted time: every month for techniques



In regard to time frame, what if the fear right after it coincides with the one you're working on? Awesome, right? :)

I made this cardigan for my closest friend. She loves grey colors

I fount this 100% merino wool on sale about a month ago. It is just so wonderfully soft. And they had exactly one skein of dark grey - perfect for this horse chart I have long wanted to knit. Although the chart was a little to big for the cardigan
Other then making sure it would fit a size medium and placing the chart
It has saddle shoulders to minimize sewing at the end.

I'm kind of burnt out on making things for other people to see it go unappreciated and unused. It seems like for at least the past two years I've produced so much, I'm putting my foot down and saying 2013 will be MY year! I will knit what I want, when I want, and with the colors and brands I want all for myself!! Even writing this out makes me feel a little rush of excitement!
So I'm sure I won't stick completely to this and will still make things for my immediate family and such, well...a doormat at times, letting people take advantage of me too much; I'm trying hard to work on being more assertive and I'm kind of hoping that The Year of Selfish Knitting will help me with that, with learning that it is completely okay just  say no to people sometimes!
Okay rant part over! Anyway

What say we try something scary

That's the [Deathflake](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/search#pattern-link=deathflake-chart&amp;view=cards) over there.   
The chart is [here](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/deathflake-chart)

If you've always been terrified of Fairisle, [a lovely lavender sachet](http://redd.it/126afb) or just a square -- it can always become a pocket on something later.  

Not into Fairisle, a tiny scrap of lace -- and next week we can post the results in all their ~~gory~~ glory.  

One long FO thread of mangled scraps and tortured samples -- what could be more fitting?
