Please continue to make a speedy recovery from your injuries, when you assured us all that you were good to go and would carry us to another AFC North crown. Unfortunately, your foot carried us to a disappointing result and a fateful day in Denver most of us would like to forget. So please, Ben, keep your newborn child, teammates, and loyal fan base in mind when lobbying to play this Sunday. We really want to win this game, not the beat up

Sincerely

A loyal Steelers fan

P.S. We also don’t want Brian Hoyer or Batch under center for the remaining four games

No we’re not destined for a mediocre season or 8-8 or 5-11 as some of you are already predicting us for. Reading the comments in this forum these last few days has shown me there are a lot of overreactors out there. Here are some key points that need to be said:

**Why on earth would the Steelers pay Lewis starter money when it was not even a guarantee he would be starting next season?**

For everyone who thinks we should have “paid the man” need to realize it wasn’t even a sure thing Lewis would be our #2 guy next season. Of course if we paid him starter money our hand would have been forced to start him

Now don’t get me wrong

**Speaking of overpaying

This is just like the Wallace situation last year. Until someone actually gives Sanders an offer the Steelers’ do not have to throw any additional cash at Sanders. Sure the RFA tag is like walking on egg shells but we have the first right to match the offer and if Sanders is THAT important to the Steelers they can definitely find a way to match it. Like Colbert said last year, not us…

If we lose Sanders, I can believe it too. But again, that's playing hypothetical as Sanders hasn't even been given an offer yet and the Steelers haven't refused the right to match it. We still have all the control at this point.

**The Steelers are fine guys relax!**

We still have Ben. We still have LeBeau and Butler.  We are still a top tier team in this league. I remember how horrible it was when the Steelers let Joey Porter walk, and will continue to. There is a reason we are the most successful franchise since the merger (in our opinion football didn’t exist pre-merger right?), because we know how to run things from the top down. Let the other teams make fools of themselves and overpay for overrated talent. When the draft comes around the real teams will show them how it’s done.

###Offensive Player Notables:

**Le'Veon Bell** - Is stealing the show so far. Most have him as a shoe in starter come week 1. They say what he's shown so far is all the grit and power that both Redman and Dwyer contain



**Jonathan Dwyer** - Hearing mixed reviews of this guy. Most were in agreement that he showed up to OTA's a little hefty



**Redman** - Redman is as consistent as they come and it’s pretty much business as usual in regards to what you'll get out of him in camp. He's now the vet of the group so he's pretty much setting the tone. Hasn't shown anything new so what you've seen is what you're getting.



**Will Johnson** - I've seen his name come up quite a bit on twitter and news articles. I have read he is one of the biggest standouts so far this camp. With David Johnson still limping around on the sidelines



**David Johnson / Heath Miller** - Both on the PUP

**Antonio Brown** - Business as usual for Brown. Him and Ben have great chemistry amongst each other and have had several TD strikes in various drills. They've made mincemeat of younger CB's who are playing because our CB's are dropping like flies.



**Emmanuel Sanders** - Its been reported this guy has shown up to play. Running faster than most have seen him



**Markus Wheaton** - Is for the most part living upto the hype. I would say expectations but some felt he was a little overhyped coming into camp. Word is he’s looking pretty legit. As Tomlin would say ""so far it’s mostly football in shorts""

**Plaxico** - Actually looks pretty decent so far. Had a nice red zone catch and a few other leap frogs which is what we (and especially Ben) want to see from the big guy.



**Mike Adams** - Doesn't look like that stabbing affected him one bit. Gilbert kicked off camp at LT



**Maurkice Pouncey** - I've seen someone report he's upto 300lbs now but zero complaints out of this guy. He opened camp and said his peace about the hat situation



**Marcus Gilbert** - I read he welcomed 1st round LB Jones to the NFL by dominating him several times in head on drills



**Kelvin Beachum** - While everyone loved Legursky for his versatility



**Ben Roethlisberger** - Looks red hot so far. Great shape, just a dude his is prime right now.



###Other offensive tidbits:

David Paulson has looked good as a pass catcher so far



Wilson vs. Landry battle. Some sites are starting to speculate a QB battle brewing here but im not buying it. The credible sources are seeing both QB's as pretty inconsistent for the most part and the Steelers will stick with the draft pick over an obvious camp body.



Curtis McNeal - Remember the name



Ramon Foster - Reported by Lolley has yet to be beaten 1on1 so far this camp. Most felt his spot was up for grabs but its not looking that way.



###Defensive Player Notables:

**Cornerbacks** - I guess we'll lump this into 1 group as we havent seen much. Most are hurt



**NT** - This will be the second spot we lump together as well as it’s been equally as quiet. Have heard McLendon is upto par though a little banged up



**The Beard, it will be interesting to see what happens here. Hoke has been a big influence in camp and in his belief we have 3 LeBeau starters with only 2 positions to put them in.



**LaMarr Woodley** - While he hasn't put down the camera or still doesn't shy away from any chance to be in front of it



**Jarvis Jones** - Mixed reviews from him so far. A lot have hyped the ""J.J. Wyatt type play"" he made batting down a Roethlisberger pass, but more like 3rd and 4th stringers. Though it has been said that Jones is a student of the game and he’s playing it slow and learning LeBeau’s defense faster than others. He has been complimented on how quickly he implements feedback from his coaching staff which they love. I guess we'll wait and see what he puts on tape...



**Jason Worilds** - To Jones credit

**Marshall McFadden** - Is a name I am hearing a lot. Attitude, most like what he's brought so far.



**Troy Polamalu** - Great feedback from Jim Wexell in regards to Polamalu dodging the media thus far this camp. Polamalu appears to be a man on a mission this year who completely changed not only his workout routine



**Shamarko Thomas** - Steelersdepot.com posted an article about Ike Taylors feedback on Thomas. If you haven’t seen it yet check it out, he has said himself he has two of the best safeties in the NFL who are both providing him tremendous feedback.



###Other Defensive tidbits:

**Vince Williams** - a player to watch in preseason. Been shifted around a bit

**Al Woods** - still not sure what to make of him. They slid him to NT

**Chris Carter** - Name has not been talked about yet so far in camp but most of the time we hear it has been because of injury. No news might be good news,,False,self,t5_2r526,1375903916.0,,True

Sometime in the fall of 2005, at Pamela's in Shadyside on a Monday morning.  It was just a bit after 8am and the dining room was moderately full with the usual buzz and clinking of people sharing their conversations.  There was a slight lull in the overall noise, but I was reading and couldn't be bothered to look up.

My waitress came over with a coffee refill and my pancakes.  I folded away the paper to notice a new group of four that was sitting at the table next to mine.  There was no question

No drama.  No approaches to their table.  No kids asking for autographs.  There were glances over by everyone, they paid their check, got up and limped out.  And not one person said a word, because that's how great Steeler fans are.  We recognize there is football time, autograph/personal appearance time, and family time.  Nobody wanted to disturb their family time.

The waitress did confirm she was well tipped.

Even with these guys stepping up

**Emerging leaders.**  It will be interesting to see how McLendon steps up as a starter.  He's a veteran player who is just now getting handing the starting role.  I've given up a bit on Hood as ever emerging as more than what he is.  He's a decent DE but probably not a star.  Cam Heyward however is my sleeper pick for most improved from both a player and leadership role this year.  If he get's handed a starting role I think he will be a star player in our defense for a long time.

**Time to step up!**  Timmons and/or Woodley.  If these two ever have ""career years"" at the same time


**On the losses this offseason.** Overall I think we're better off than most might realize.  It was time for a ""spring cleaning"" and the emergence of a new motivated young team to step up.  From that perspective I think this offseason was as good as it could have been.  I'm sure Harrison will dominate some games for the Bengals.  He'll probably have some great games against us.  But we HAVE to see if Worilds is the long term solution


**Most pressing draft needs.**  We can instantly use a starting RB or WR.  We could actually start the season with who we have but the spots are there for a rookie to take.  OLB and ILB are huge needs of depth and potential future stars, Timmons, Woodley.  A young stud could take over Foote's job at some point in the year if we get lucky in the draft. In the defensive backfield we could use a young safety to fill in on spot duty and eventually take over for Clark or Polamalu, but again they wouldn't start this year unless there was an injury. 


There's my brain dump on the steelers upcoming year. I'm excited for the draft and to see a new young steelers team emerge this year.

""I don't understand this,000, the New York Giants hoped to give residents of the devastated area something to cheer about--boy did they do the opposite.  
  
""What more could we have done?"" The quarterback said

After jumping out to a 20-10 lead, ""I figured the game was in the bag.""   
  
Every thing was going smoothly for the Giants, O.K.?',"" Giant CB Corey Webster added, ""But I guess he didn't hear me.""  
  
""Are you fucking kidding me?"" Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger said,"" N.Y. resident Vinny Baggadonuts said as he shook his head, ""I guess us New Yorker's are the only ones with class.""

Lewis is going to command a big payday, fully capable of assuming a starting role opposite of Ike, guarding either the slot or Z receiver. 

Lewis isn't a #1 CB, but hes not in the same league as the elite cover corners out there. He isn't even the best CB on the team, as Ike takes that title. 

He likely leaves, Lewis, or no Lewis. Oh, and by the way, Cortez Allen is only a cap charge of $650M and $740M for '13 and '14.

**NEITHER OF THESE TEAMS LOSES TWO IN A ROW. THEY JUST DON'T.**

Just as last week's Packers game was a ""must-win"" for them vs the Bears

Let's look at a some of the past and projections for this matchup:

http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/football/nfl-matchups.aspx?page=/data/NFL/matchups/g1_summary_15.html

The over looks pretty good

Recent meetings are pretty interesting. Since 2010, it's not great. Baltimore has only had 2 of the 10 meetings go their way. Baltimore is learning to hold their own as of late, but this is a lopsided arrangement in favour of the Pats.

When the Pats do lose 2 in a row

The last time the Pats lost 2 straight before that was...2009.

For Baltimore, there have not been back-to-back losses.

Keeping with 2009

The ramifications for both teams are huge. Already the Pats are part of the 1-1 logjam that most of the NFL finds itself in with all teams of the AFC East being equal at .500 right now. The only bright spot is that Miami and the Jets are going to meet

The Ravens don't have it much better. They're tied with the Bengals and with us at 1-1. We are fortunate to face a reeling Raiders team, a team devastated by defensive injuries. They are also suffering a coaching controversy on defense and in the locker room. The Ravens could find themselves on the outside looking in on a pair of playoff teams from 2011.

From our perspective, so asking the Ravens to help us could be sealing our own fate in tiebreakers for them. Going to Foxboro is never pleasant if you're the Steelers.
