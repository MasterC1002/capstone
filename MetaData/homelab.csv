Do this.... should keep you busy for a couple of months. Any time you see ""backup"" assume it means restore from those backups too.... except your Domain Controller backups. No sense nuking the core of your lab.

Others please contribute for products I've skipped or basic items under products I didn't put.

VAG* - Virtual Access Gateway (Server 2008 R2 + Unified Access Gatway Array) - Publish Exchange services and VPN access (SSTP). Still playing!

VAP* - Virtual Application Servers (Server 2012 and Server 2008 R2 - DirSync for EOP+Azure and AGPM)

VBS01 - Freebsd 9 running BIND (External DNS + AXFR to remote DNS servers)

VCB01 - Working on backing up our shit to the butt (Gonna take months). Running FreeBSD 9 + duplicity for encrypted backups. If anyone knows to how continue a transfer without restarting the whole backup

VDB - Virtual DB servers 2 are Freebsd and one is Server 2012. Server 2012 is running the DB for SCCM

VDC - DCs are Active Directory DCs. 3 in server VLAN

VSS and VDP - DP+WSUS+MP For SCCM and VSS is SCCM Site Server.

VEA - Exchange 2013 CAS Server array (In NLB

VED - Exchange 2013 Mailbox Database Server.

VMX -  Exchange 2010 Hub Transport Server (Comes in and goes out from EOP)

VMO - Zabbix monitoring server

VUL - Plex media servers - One for Movies and TV

VPC - Workstations - usually log into these when I'm out and about.

VWS - Freebsd 9 web servers - not really used ATM.

VFS - Federation server - used for SSO for Azure+Office 365.

**NETWORK**

ISP: Centurylink Business Class (Had to

40Mbps/20Mbps

Modem VDSL2 (Nothing fancy


External Router: Mikrotik 450G

Connection: PPPoE to ISP

Routing: BGP to Internal + BGP to Some VPN Sites (Not Azure). BGP Is set to default originate here (Default gatway for BGP sites that allow it

Firewall rules reside here. NAT and (a little) QoS is also done here (Currently have a /29 and I use all the usable IPs (5x) for various things).

Current VPN Setup:

Site to Site:

Each tunnel gets a /30 (Internal) transit lan for GRE. This traffic is encrypted by IPSec. This allows BGP traffic to pass and routes to be established. See [this (kind of) for more info or ask me](http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=67957).

I currently have a tunnel to a friend here in my state

I also have a standard IPSec tunnel to Azure for internal play.

Client VPN:

Currently using UAG portal for RDP gateway and SSTP VPN.

Internal Router: Mikrotik 450G

Routing: BGP

Connected to External Router by separate transit subnet.

VLANS: /24 for Servers, /24 for Capture the Flag (In progress, could use suggestions - all remote sites have their own CTF subnet).

Switch: HP ProCurve J9450A (24 port managed GigE switch).

Other VLANS (Ports):

4 x Access VLANS for Each MPIO NIC on Storage server (not routed).

WiFi:

Nothing fancy. Mikrotik something or another that does N. In clients VLAN.

So I ran ""iftop -P"" to see what port all this traffic was on

So I was trying to remember if I recently ticked off anyone on the internetz recently

So...the only way I can think of mitigating something like this is to block it further upstream before my pipe becomes a bottleneck.  I'm not sure how I would do that on a residential connection.  I also could just refresh my dynamic IP

  **(I used a Hub to make the setup as clean as possible. I'd recommend a powered hub if you have boat loads of devices)**

You can obviously do the wiring any way you want...like using console cables instead of the DB9/RJ45 adapters like I did. **[HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/19odee/cisco_rollover_cable_your_services_are_no_longer/)** is the post on how to to wire the adapters.

I used **[these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007T27H8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)** USB/Serial Adapters since they were cheap and they worked without effort in Ubuntu 12.10.

###**Here are the steps I took:**

1. Hook it all up

2. Install Ubuntu Server 12.10 on the PC.

  **(I made my hostname AccessServer...I also selected to OpenSSH Server option when presented with tasksel)**

3. Install the software to make the magic happen (ser2net)

  Here are the terminal commands I used...**[this](http://cciedynamips.wordpress.com/category/6-installing-setting-up-ser2net/)** and **[this](http://mellowd.co.uk/ccie/?tag=ser2net)** will probably help you.

**Update your packages:**

    sudo apt-get update

**Install ser2net**

    sudo apt-get install ser2net

**Determine the names of your serial ports**
  
My built in ports were ttyS0 (serial) and ttyS1 (parallel).

My USB/Serial adapters were ttyUSB0

    dmesg | grep tty

**Edit the config file in a text editor**

    sudo nano /etc/ser2net.conf

**Modify the end of the file**

This is what mine looked like...I used all USB adapters to make the physical wiring nice and clean

    2000:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB0:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2001:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB1:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2002:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB2:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2003:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB3:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    ...

Press Ctrl+O to write the file

**Restart ser2net so the changes are there**

    sudo /etc/init.d/ser2net restart

**All Done! Now test via telnet from another computer on your LAN**

    telnet AccessServer [port]

Use the port number that lines up with the tty device you typed into the config file. I like to use SecureCRT and keep sessions open with all devices in tabs.

You could make a few changes to the setup if you want to access the server remotely

**I simply did this to remove wires from my apartment and make it so I only need to get up for topology changes. Changes to router/switch configurations no longer disconnect me. Think of it as a local out-of-band management**

**Enjoy!!!**

* APC Smart-UPS x 750 with two battery packs.

* IBM 1: One single core AMD opteron 250 with 2GB's of ram and 2 10k 74.6GB SCSI drives in RAID 1. It runs pfsense 2.0.2 for my firewall/router.

* 2850: Two single core hyperthreaded xenon's at 3.2ghz. 6 147gb 10k SCSI drives, a reverse http proxy, streams music via DLNA.

* IMB 2: Runs FreeBSD 9. Mainly just a minecraft server and that's it. 10GB's of ram

* 2950: Has two quad core xenon E5420. Four 15k 300GB SAS drives in RAID5 and 2 2TB SATA drives in RAID1. Runs Debian 6 with a xen hypervisor. Runs VM's for my PBX and a few for windows. This server is mainly just a fileserver and a seedbox for torrents.

Oh and those switches on top are just spares I've accumulated. One is a Cisco 2950 24 port and the other is a Linksys/Cisco SFE2000. My switch that's actually in use is in another room

pfSense will server as my router

1358363074.0,16p6y6,Hosting multiple VPSs on a small home server.,52358,17,2,24,"Hey guys! I had this idea the other day

My formal (and undergoing) education is in computer science

I have an Amazon EC2 VPS on which I run a few web projects. I also (used to) have two small home servers mainly used for web development and as a testing ground for web apps prior to uploading them to EC2.  

Anyway, but I wanted to do something more challenging for both the sake of the learning experience and the awesome setup that would result from it if I succeeded.  

The machine that I plan on using for this is not necessarily meant to be a server
- 3.06GHz Intel Pentium E6600 (eh)  
- 4GB DDR3 RAM  
- 500GB SATA HDD with 32MB cache  
- 1TB SATA HDD with 64MB cache  

What I want to do is setup 3 VPSs on the above machine:  
- a file/backup server to take advantage of all that disk space
- a web server/development environment
- a Minecraft server

I'm not particularly worried about performance issues from running three VPSs on that machine as none of them are expected to get much traffic: the file server will be used only for periodical backup of my laptop over LAN; the web server will mostly only be accessed by me and my roommates

Now, but that won't help me much. I have some experience with virtualization in Windows using VMware and VirtualBox, but I don't think this will be quite the same thing. The host system will have no GUI (nor will any of the guest VPSs for that matter), and while I'm aware that there is a CLI implementation of VirtualBox, I don't know if that is the best solution for this performance-wise.  

I tried to do some research on this, I found really insightful on the subject: http://www.ultramonkey.org/papers/lvs_tutorial/html/  

I also stumbled upon KVM (http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) which seems like it might be the exact thing I'm looking for

I want to build(or should I use on of the servers listed above(except the NAS)) a server to learn on. I want to learn VMWare Esxi

My question:

Should i grab the motherboard/cpu from the Supermicro server and put it in another case that wont be as loud? I would love to use the Supermicro but it is too loud to put in my house. I can't keep it in the garage because I'm a woodworker and the dust will cause harm. I have this pile of semi decent hardware and not sure how to utilize it.

* The servers come with caddys and rails (from most sellers). They take 4x 3.5"" SATA drives.
* Most come with dual quad-core processors
* DDR2 ECC RAM
* 1x PCI-E x16 slot for whatever you'd like
* On-board IPMI (allows KVM through web console
* VERY quiet boot-up. The fans on max speed are still much more quiet than any Dell Poweredge or HP ProLiant server

The server stays very quiet, however, is that OS X users will find the remote KVM unusable (Java issues I am trying to work through right now), but Windows and Linux work perfectly.

I look forward to any questions or ideas regarding these servers. I would like to raise some awareness of these nice servers being offered for sale

The power supply is a bit high wattage but I wanted to get modular and this was the lowest rated I could find. Thinking something gold rated might be better as this things will probably run 24/7.  

Starting with 16gb of RAM and can upgrade later if required. I think there should be enough expansion slots on the motherboard if I want to add extra network cards at a later stage also.  

  
Any input/ideas would be great!

Is the technet subscription worth it to get testing licenses?

How do you go about isolating your lab environment as a subnetwork that routes effectively through your basic netgear to the internet

I tried m0n0wall and I was having a hell of a time getting the two subnets to communicate effectively.

I continually had the issue of the DHCP server on the netgear issuing IP's to the VM guests when they should be broadcasting a request to the m0n0wall subnet

Any preferred way of doing this? Any config examples, etc.?

Ideally I want to have a dhcp server on both subnets. In the lab I want static lease IP's. In the lab, I just want plain vanilla dhcp from a pool.

Edit:

Thanks for the replies. I have a few comments:

1. I won't be buying a managed switch for VLAN's. I'm going with the philosophy of utilizing my ESXi host to virtualize the solution

2. I am using a Netgear [WNR3500L](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netgear_WNR3500L). I realize I can put a different router OS on here like Tomato or DDWRT

First drive is all OS and home directories. The other two drives are share drives made up of one partition on each that is shared via samba with windows clients. Nothing is in any kind of RAID. 

I'm asking for anyone with experience with a gigabit network and similar hardware to let me know what kind of data throughput I should get morning files back and forth. Basically I am wondering at perfect conditions what speed should I expect from gigabit over fast Ethernet.

I'm new here and I think this subreddit is awesome. I want to make my first (serious) homelab. I already have my raspberryPi as a homelab but the more I use it the more I find I want faster hardware.

I want my homelab to have the following software on it (minimally) and run smooth as silk.

* Sabnzbd (download handler)
* Sickbeard (database for tv shows on my nas)
* Couchpotato (database for movies on my nas)
* I want it to be a NAS (with about 8 drives) on a ZFS 'raid'
* I want to host a webpage (to learn the basics/very low traffic)
* newznab+ in localhost only (huge database)

Basically I want tons of storage available on LAN and SFTP. This will be my home media server that will send data to my PIs connected to some TVs and my PCs. Other softwares are for downloading the media and managing it.

The build I came up with this week is missing hard drives and case. I was thinking going rackmount with a Norco case if you think it is a good path.

Feel free to change any part you want I just want some help with this build.

I have a total budget of £1100 to spend on the server.

My plan is to install ESXI on a memory stick and use the Samsung SSD for primary VMs DNS

My question is is what I'm doing best for performance? Should I go for multiple smaller drives about 300GB drives and have 3 VMs per drive or a raid array or will one SSHHD perform? I'm trying to store all data off the OS disk so they don't need the space of raid but

Would installing freenas on a memory stick and having a dedicated data disk shared over SMB for all the VMs work well or would it result in better performance storing the data on the VM OS disk? 

Very undecided on storage and how I'm going to do that.

I haven't chosen an Intel network card but would preferably like something with two gigabit NICs.

I have chosen the FX8320 over the FX8350 because I've been told its so easy to over clock it I can save some money. Will it really be that easy while running ESXI or should I just buy the faster CPU?

The reason I have chosen an expensive motherboard is I plan to use this computer for other things as well as my lab. I'm also considering a Corsair H110 with push pull. I'd like some more powerful


**Update 6/7/13:**

For networking im going to go for an [Intel Pro/1000 VT Quad Port 10/100/1000 - £137](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Genuine-Dell-Intel-Pro-1000-VT-Quad-Port-10-100-1000-Ethernet-Part-0YT674-295-/151066216327?pt=UK_Computing_Servers&amp;hash=item232c3f8787)

Just ordered an ex display Bitfenix Ghost for £50 for the case.

I'm still pretty undecided on storage. I think I'm gonna use SSD for all VM OS storage. Should I get two 128GB SSDs or one 256GB SSD? Its better value for money to get the 256GB but whats better for performance?

Would having one mechanical disk dedicated for data shared via SMB by Freenas give me good enough performance

1. What's the quickest way I can backup the SQL and vCenter VMs? Should I just copy the VM folders? Should I export as an OVF/OVA? Eventually I'd like to setup a backup solution like VEEAM but it looks like it'll take some time and planning

The VM folders are currently on an NFS share on a Synology NAS. I can browse to the share with NFS or SMB. Could I browse to it using Windows/OS X using SMB and make a copy of it to another location? This is my first time using NFS so I'm just cautious of using another protocol to browse to it

I'm not sure if I'm going to turn on HA or FT in my environment but if I do I might take 1 NIC from the Storage team for it.

When you're using NIC teaming I know you can setup how each one is used

Is there a best practice when it comes to choosing which NICs to team together? Do you just team 0 and 1

* potentially higher reliability from higher quality

I've decided to move the box into my office and get a new XBMC client for the TV. This is going to free the server up for it's original use as **just** a server

A few months ago I built a NAS based on an N40L for my mate where I just used FreeNAS on a USB pendrive. I'm thinking of going this way myself as I like ZFS. However I'd actually like to run FreeNAS as a VM under ESXi. This would then allow me to spin up new VMs when I wanted to play with new tech

Significant changes

* I have changed the motherboard to the GA-990FXA series. It appears to be the most popular AMD ESXi board (and it has more expansion slots). 
* Changed the NIC to a higher quality Intel card
* Added a CPU cooler
* Lower powered PSU. Based on PCPartPickers Wattage estimation

1359169300.0,17aod8,"Planning a home ""workstation"". Suggestions?",BlindTreeFrog,10,2,11,"I apologise if this is the wrong forum to ask or if my initial searches failed to find this info already

  
Background:  
A year or two ago I built a new PC when it was time to upgrade.  At the time I meant to start abusing virtual machines more to sandbox some things off
  
I don't game on my PC aside from the occasional flash game or Dwarf Fortress.  About the only resource intensive stuff I regularily do is media encoding/transcode/serving.   Otherwise, and normal day to day stuff.  
  
Intended plan:    
My current (possibly grossly flawed) thoughts are to install a hyper-visor hosting:    
1. a file server managing the bulk of the hard drive space available in some manner    
2. a general use OS for the normal day to day home pc activities (probably Win 7 Home
3. a linux guest for code development and general linux hacking    
4. Possibly other VM's for toying with
  
I'd expect normal use would be just VM's 1 and 2.     
  
Software needs/desires:    
Media ripping and serving is the only thing that I think I need to call out as the serving side might require some thought on my end on how to do best (which VM to put it on and set up and such).   Anything else resource intensive can generally run for as long as it would need to.  
  
Question 1: Hardware    
To get the hardware specs out of the way:    
CPU: AMD Phenom II X6 Black  
Mem: 8GB  
HDD: 120GB SSD for system
Mb: Gigabyte 890GPA-UD3H  
  
Currently, but I wanted to double check.  
  
Question 2: Host software  
What virtualization software should I be looking into?  I'm assuming the free offerings out there will suit me fine as I'm not running SQL servers or 20 machines or anything.   Poking around the web
  
I'm using KVM at work for virtualization tasks (a build server and test sandboxes)
  
I use Virtualbox at home when I want to set up a VM for whatever reason.  
  
Microsoft's offerings are probably right out.  I don't get the feeling it will play well with linux.  
  
I'm not sure VMWare is better than anything else for what I need
  
Question 3: Guest Setup  
Any suggestions on setting up the guests?  I am not a fan of volume sets or JBOD or similar so I was not planning on spanning anything across the physical drives.   I was thinking of a virtual drive for the guest's system install with another for a data drive (per VM as needed).  I figure that lets me reinstall the guest if I need to without losing data/programs which means i can tinker more with less risk.  Also

On the topic of flawed thinking
  
Also, but are their advantages to using a format that might have to be recoded for a different hypervisor?  
  
Question 4: File Server  
I'm assuming FreeNAS is a good one to start reading up on

Question 5: Further research  
Any recommendations on places I should look for more info?  Like I said, or my searches might just be flawed.

And if you made it this far

EDIT II:  
It seems that I do not have a motherboard that supports IOMMU... this might be a issue with ripping and burning media.

1365734356.0,1c6jh5,Thinking about expanding my current setup,jairuncaloth,11,4,8,"Hi guys, but I wasn't really going for a lab at the time. Currently I'm a data center tech
  
I live in an apartment so I'm pretty limited on space. Noise is a huge concern since all of my gear is localized to one room which is basically our living room. Setting up a rack of servers is probably not feasible and stringing Cat5 down the hall is not likely to go well with the lady of the house

I am most comfortable with Linux as far as day to day use goes. However, and spinning up a new server when I want to add a service would be relatively easy and good practice. I'm not really sure how many hosts a single ESX server can realistically provide. I imagine memory and disk I/O will be limiting factors but I really have no concept of how many servers I can support with X GB of RAM and Y TB of disk space. I also don't really know what sort of hard disk configuration would make an ideal setup for something like this. Information on what I can reasonably expect to host on a single machine as well as ideas for disk configurations would be highly useful.  
  
Current setup  
Desktop / Gaming Rig:  
 - OS: Xubuntu 13.04 / Win 7 Pro 64  
 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz  
 - 16GB DDR3 1600
 - 120GB SSD OS disk  
 - 2TB SATA HDD for storage

File/playground server (aka old desktop)  
 - OS: FreeBSD 9   
 - Intel Core2 Duo CPU E6550  @ 2.33GHz  
 - 4 GB DDR2 SDRAM  
 - 4x 2TB 7200RPM SATA HDDs configured in raidz  
 - Some random 100G SATA disk for OS

TV Computer / Media consumption (Foxconn mini-itx barebones box):  
 - OS: XBMCbuntu  
 - Dual Core Atom (Older
 - 2GB RAM  
 - 64GB SSD OS disk  
  
Network:  
Linksys 610N router with DD-WRT  
Cisco 2900XL 24 port 10/100 switch (currently not in service)  
  
Things I want to practice and play with:  
- Setting up and designing networks in a many host type of environment (vlans
- Firewall setup and admin  
- Virtualization software - I'm thinking ESX is the likely choice here  
- OS admin in a many host / mixed OS environment (user accounts
- Services - Mail, PXE, anything else I might decide to play with  
- Database servers  
- SAN (I'm super new to SAN so I don't even know what is really possible at home) 
  
I don't really think the file server would make a good server for the kind of stuff I have in mind
  
My linksys router's 4 ports are all filled up, and a high level of functionality is desired. I'm not sure how much of the network functionality I can put on a virtualized server, but the more the better. Overall getting the network figured out is probably the area I need the most help with.

## ESXi HOST SETUP

-----------------

* **Processor:** AMD Phenom II X6 2.8ghz 
* **Motherboard:** MSI 760GM-E51 AM3 760G mATX
* **Memory:** 16GB DDR3 (4x4GB)
* **HDDs (5 on-board SATA):** 
    * 1x 320GB Western Digital (single platter) - Runs ESXi
    * 3x 1TB - Samsung 7200rpm HDDs (raw deviced mapped to NexentaStor)
    * 1x NON-USED 1TB WD Green drive

* **Guest VMs**: 
    * NexentaSotr - Runs file server
    * Ubuntu Media Server - Runs plex
    * Various Window Server VMs - 2x domain test environments
    * PFSense - Routing b/w various vSwitches

## PROBLEM

-----------------
My file server storage is starting to reach it's maximum size and I know that with ZFS

Ideally I would like something like this: 

* 1x 320GB HDD: Runs VMWare + Runs a few key guest VMs (NexentaStor for instance)
* **ESXi Datastore POOL**: 2x 1TB (7200 rpm) mirrored - will act as an NFS datastore for ESXi host
* **File Server POOL**: 2x 3TB (5400 rpm) mirrored (or 2x 4TB disks) - used for CIFS/SMB sharing

and MAYBE buy a PCI card to add more SATA ports and do: 
* 2x 1TB (5400 rpm

I know that a ZFS mirror setup is more ideal for adding storage space in the future

**How does this sound? Any suggestions?**


## ZFS

-----------------
So say that I go about doing the above. I would obviously add a single 3TB disk to my server, attach my 2nd 3TB disk and attach it to the storage pool I created. At this point, the data should then start to mirror. 

Then I should be able to add the reamining 2x 1TB disks and create a pool for my VMWare Datastore and use that to host some of my guest VMs?

I currently rent a townhouse with a few of my friends, I don't want the noise of a rack to bother my roommates, and I definitely cannot frame out a portion of a room for my lab. So I am left with my decently sized bedroom as pretty much my only option. (I am going to look into solutions to keep the fan noise down as best I can, but even if I have to sleep with ear plugs, I am going through with this.)

But the whole townhouse is always dusty, change the filter on the central AC, all that stuff, and I still start getting a fine film of dust and cat hair on my stuff within a day... And my current hardware (in the basement) collects dust to the point where I take them outside every other week to clean with my air compressor.

My landlord will not pay for duct cleaning, I would like to be able to take the setup with me.

Also

I have been thinking about buying an enclosed rack and venting the AC into it. But the only rack options I have found so far either include vented rear doors

Although not new to computers I am new to servers. I picked up a dell cs24-sc to mess around with (no operating system pre-installed). From what I gather about these servers, The one I got is 4 73Gb hard drives, 16GB RAM, and 2 2.5 Ghx Xeon processors. 

I figured servers would be like desktops in the way the operating systems are, or the language selection screen for ubuntu, it would just black screen (ie show the windows logo, then try and go to the next screen but all that came up was black).  The only thing I could get to load was a ubuntu desktop live cd and obviously that won't work for my situation. I also tried to install an OS over the network but same issue. Since I am new to servers, is there something I can try? Is it a driver issue of some sort? Bad hardware?

The second part of the topic is this, so does anyone have a recommendation for a distro that is beginner friendly but powerful? My main things I'm looking to do is file server and hosting a few small games, although that is subject to change as new ideas come to mind?

My idea is to setup a NFS server to hold all the data from Windows / Linux machines on the network including servers while having the Fogserver serve the images to them.



So every save on a Windows 7 machine would really write to the NFS turning them into thin clients. Same for Linux machines.


So what do you think about the idea? A striped RAID 0 Array to store data as fast as possible before we have a chance to write it to a RAID 1 array.

Essentially the RAID 0 acts as a cache until we have a chance to copy the data onto the RAID 1 Array


So two of these: http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/15351-15351-4237916-4237918-4237917-4248009.html?dnr=1

I took the 250GB drive that came with the ESXi 54L server and put it in the NAS4Free box in a RAID0.  The ESXi server is booting off a USB drive
  
This setup is fine for now because I only have one ESXi host.  But I want to setup an ESXi host in VirtualBox on my desktop and also connect it to the same Datastore on the NAS4Free server so I can play with vMotion.  And also eventually get more hard drives to create another iSCSI target for backups.  
  
So to do this I'll need a switch and if I have to get one I'd like it to do everything I want which right now is support Jumbo frames and LACP for NIC teaming.  So what managed gigabit switch would you recommend for this?

Here is a diagram of what I'm trying to do.  The circles around the links are to be teamed together and I'll be buying more network cards to make this happen.  The links from the PC and ESXi server to the home router will be for internet so the Gigabit switch's main purpose will be to pass iSCSI traffic.

Rear side of Rack: APC 7902 PDU

All of this stuff is pretty obvious. It’s wired with INE topology provided above. The only thing really interesting here is that the APC 7902 PDU had a 110v/30a plug


**Home Network:**

Loosely called home network because it provides my network connectivity for personal use, but it also provides remote access to the CCIE Lab and internet access to the servers.

Router: 3825 with 1GB RAM, VPN, and WebVPN

Switch: C3750-48TS-E

CPE Modem

Belkin DIR-615 with DD-WRT acting as a “dumb” access point

Nothing too special here


**Server Network**

2x Rackable Systems (now SGI) 2u servers. I couldn’t find a model number

1x [SuperMicro AS1021TM-T+](http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SM-OP25X2-PB-R)

2x [SuperMicro SuperServer 6015T-INF](http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SM-QC283X4-PB-R)

All told, and they are quiet enough to run all the time, but they just don’t have the same build quality as the SuperMicro. However, considering my bed is 10 feet away, the SuperMicro servers are just too loud to run 24/7. Incredibly powerful pieces of equipment though.

**Rack and Power**

The rack is a Skeletek C28U-4P-EX16 (http://www.dantraknet.com/category/47). I originally bought the two post rack when it was network equipment only, the thing seems incredibly strong. I would definitely recommend this.
I also have an APC 2200RM2U. With the all the routers and switches and the two Rackable Systems servers turned on


**Lessons Learned**

1.	Don’t get 2500 series routers. They seem like they are a great deal for backbone routers (route injection only) because they only cost $20. However, so you need to buy an AUI cable and transceiver, which is about $30 dollars a router. Also, you need to find an 2500 series IOS image that supports IPv6, which means you’ll need a new one that’s larger, so you’ll need more RAM. 2500 series RAM isn’t cheap, so expect to end up paying $70 dollars for a single 2500 series backbone router. Considering a 2621 is about $30-40, you’re much better off getting the newer

2.	1841s are a great choice for a home lab router. They are new enough to support the IOS 15.x series images, and use less than 100w. They are fairly powerful and since most came from branch offices, they generally have AIM VPN cards already inside so it’s easier to do VPN stuff, if that’s your thing.

3.	Get a console server for your routers. The annoyance saved by not having to move a console cable around is well worth, throw in some octal cables, and you’ll spend less and have a more secure console server.

4.	Following on the previous point, you can cycle power to reboot a locked up router.
5.	Rackmounts are an expense I didn’t consider. At ~10 a pop

6.	On the server front, which means mounting the ESXi flash drive was much cleaner and didn’t use up one of the two external USB slots


**Standing Issues**

1.	The one UPS isn’t enough for all the equipment to be run through it. I probably will have to get another one if I want to run everything at once.

2.	I have no remote power control of the servers or home area of the network. A SmartUPS NIC card will probably be added sometime down the road.

So for changes, old IPS-800 units with an APC AP7930 Switched Rack PDU. And lastly, my new 3U storage box that is a NFS server for my VM nodes, so I can do live-migrations between nodes.

Full Rack Specs: (Top to Bottom)

* Netgear N900 Wireless Router
* SamKnows Speedtest Router (Netgear N300) 
* Ooma Home Phone Unit
* 1U Rackable Systems Server (Xeon Quad 2.5GHz, 4x Intel Gigabit ether PCI-E card)
* HP 1810-48G Switch (J9660A)
* Chenbro 3U Storage Server (Core 2 Duo 2.66GHz, 4x 2TB, 4x 300GB.) After my RAID config, there is 7.6TB of available space.
* Custom 2U Server (AMD Phenom II 840T (Unlocked to 6 core)
* HP DL360 G5 (2x Xeon Quad Core 2.5GHz, 2x 500GB 7.2K)
* HP DL360 G4 (2x Xeon 3.0GHz
* HP DL360 G3 (2x Xeon 3.2GHz
* IBM x440 (8x Xeon 1.6GHz

Sadly, and performance. Those will be the next to go. I would remove the IBM x440, but 1. its 100Lbs, and 2. its a friends, so I can't do anything with it.

What I use my Lab for is mostly hosting web services (email, owncloud, etc), and messing with OS's in VM's (Windows Server, AD and Group Policy, Linux Distros/Programs, Etc.) The 3U is a NFS storage share for my VM Nodes

For Virtualization I use Proxmox

* DHCP server over NIC 1

* DNS lookup for the server (with intention of setting up small LAN webpage on http://server instead of using IP)

* File server (sharing the 4TB drive pool for movies, etc)

And then one large partitioned HDD, or two moderate sized HDDs (one for each purpose). Then I could use something like GRUB to dual boot between the two.

My background knowledge in computers is heavily focused in windows and hardware.  I have little to no programming or linux experience.  I would like to fix this.

Ordinarily my process for this involves hours of googling and research

The googling and research stage has proven to be a challenge.  Hours in

I realize that trying to learn these things is a monumental challenge.  I realize this is a process

Thank you again for your suggestions on a proper set up for this.  And maybe in recommending a few tutorials for this sort of thing.  Really anything you've got.

1373347279.0,1hx1o1,Most cost efficient way to build/buy a budget server?,reallyjustawful,7,3,19,"I have been trying to figure out the most cost efficient way to get a cheap server for a gaming community and to possibly sell hosting and game servers. I want to just build a cheap server and collocate it because it seems cheaper in the long run and I could afford the costs. I currently have a VPS and I need to expand and its been a fun project so far.

I was looking on various sites and because haswell is coming out

However I was looking at used servers to see if there was any deals and I noticed that some older dual CPU servers are going for very cheap and score fairly well on benchmarks. What caught my eye was a 1u dell poweredge c1100 with the dual Xeon X5570 2.93ghz quad core processors. For $550 it comes with that and 32gb ram which is way more then we would need. While those processors are made in early 2009 they score pretty well on the benchmarks

Dual Xeon X5570s

http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+X5570+%40+2.93GHz&amp;id=1302&amp;cpuCount=2

vs

Xeon E3-1230v3

http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+E3-1230+v3+%40+3.30GHz&amp;id=1942

I am not sure how that benchmark tests the processors but dual x5570s score 9833 number things vs the E3-1230v3 scoring 9504. They are fairly close in whatever arbitrary benchmark that website does. It seems like the most popular website of its type so maybe I can trust it. The only reason I would consider the dual X5570s is because of all the extra processing threads. It would come in handy when running gameservers and VPSes. I am sure the E3-1230v3 kicks its ass for single thread processing though and absolutely destroys it comparing one x5570 to an e3-1230v3.

However having 16 threads would also help a lot when running multiple gameservers and VPSes. Keep in mind that the games we play are source games like team fortress 2, and hopefully a dayz server when it comes out. Right now my vps is being hosted on a Xeon L5640 and it runs fine although we only were allocated 4 cores and 4gb of ram. Its not bad for $70 a month but I see colocation deals for around that price or even cheaper. It would be nice to double the physical amount of cores and hyperthreading would be great. The S3-1230v2 is much newer though and while it would only be 4 cores with hyperthreading, it would also provide better single core processoring power. It would also use way less power but some of the colocation deals provide power anyway for a single server. The X5570 are already 4-5 years old but they have 4 cores with hyperthreading and support virtualization. There may be some newer processors that aren't insanely priced but for the xeon x56xx series processors, they get into crazy amounts of money. Then the e6 and 7 series of xeons are so insanely expensive that there is no reason not to just get a e3-1230v3.

One of the big reasons I was considering that used server is because it comes with 32gb of ddr3 ram as part of the cost or I could get a 72gb model for $660. Sure its probably all like 4gb sticks of ram but its plenty. It would be nice to pay like $550 and just have to add hard drives. The cost of a cheap 1u barebones supermicro rack and an E3-1230v3 is like $650-750 alone and 32gb of the cheapest ddr3 ecc ram would cost about $300 so roughly 1k total minimum. I could buy two X5570 systems for the cost of one e3-1230v3 and host way more servers :P However I probably should just buy the latest and greatest because it is new and I could upgrade it in the future if needed. However only dropping $550+storage would be nice

I am leaning towards getting a brand new system but I am also not trying to spend a lot of money at all on this project. The cost of building a new server is enough to get me a brand new modern gaming pc as well I want to keep it cheap but I know cheap and quality don't go together. Lastly whatever I build and send to the datacenter is probably how it will be. I will probably pick some budget colocation service that would charge me a crapload to put in more ram or extra harddrives so whatever I send is probably how it would remain forever.

A home lab seems to be made of three parts:

1. A head unit that runs what everyone seems to suggest: ESXi. Which is a barebone hypervisor whose purpose is to create virtual machines that act as the different roles in your home lab (and is also free to use on a machine up to 32GB of RAM?). These VMs share the processing power and RAM of the head unit making the CPU and RAM very important.

2. A body which is a storage pool. Many seem to use a NAS like Synology with loads of disks in them RAIDed together. I actually have a Synology myself. I assume the VMs virtual hard disks reside here.

3. A backbone switch to connect it all together and is usually on a separate network so as not to interrupt the home network while tinkering.

My questions are as follows:

* What kind of VM roles are in a typical home lab? I'm assuming a LDAP/AD server, mail server, database and perhaps a file server (or you just let the NAS's software cover that role?). Anything else?

* Would an i3/i5 like in the linked article actually handle all that load? Or am I severely overestimating the requirements of these VMs?

* Once setup what does one do to learn about administrating these servers? Simulate users or mail flow? Add VM client machines for testing? Once it's all set up and running what do you do to it to learn more?

* If you max out your head ESXi unit I've seen mention of adding more. This seems straight forward until I see mention of clustering. What does that mean exactly?

To wrap up I think I understand the basis of a home lab but I don't understand the finer details. I see posts about various builds and hardware suggestions but I don't know what the actual use of it is.

TLDR; I understand what a home lab is made of but what is it used for?",self,t5_2ubz7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hwr8d/just_starting_need_clarification/

Going to throw ESXI on it(flash drive) to practice setting up windows domains, and sometime down the road I'll use it for setting up a poor man's OSCP lab. Just wanted to get some input before I pull the trigger on this tonight. (Later on add another ssd or nic if necessary). Trying to keep it under $800 for now(bit flexible on this).

Thanks for the input.


Edit: Forgot to mention I've got a few regular hard drives I can throw in for storage. Also have a HP Microserver N40L doing nothing at the moment. Currently only have 4 GB in it although I know I can get it up to 16 GB with the right combination. May throw FreeNAS on it.

Box will run VMWare ESXi with VTd passthrough of the Megaraid controller to a Napp-it or FreeNAS NAS VM. The RE disks will be connected to this controller and the Nas will present storage back to ESX for the rest fo the VMs as well as the network.

1. Intel i7 3820 vs 3770 and Socket R vs 1155
   - My reasoning here is that I can build with 32GB and add another 32GB later
   - Socket R may have a longer shelf life
   - Can I go Xeon dual board and single CPU for similar cost ?
   - However power !! 130W vs 75w for 3770 
   - VT-d seems very random on motherboard support for 3770.
2. 6x1TB RE disks
   - Similar cost to 3x2TB
   - Gives 5TB useable with Raid-Z vs 4TB with 3x2TB
   - Double the spindles for more performance which ESXi will see as not going over physical network.
   - Power !! Extra 15W £15 a year
   - Anyone disagree with this reasoning ?
   - Any other manufacter worth considering for 24x7x365 RAID ?
3. Case
4. Cooler - Is this suitable for 24x7 operation
5. Motherboard assuming 2011 - From research this looks to work with VT-d for ESXi 5.1
   - Only need basic SATA support for the SSD to boot from
   - LAN support nice
6. PSU
   - Quiet and reliable
7. RAM - just picked the cheapest really
8. Far out - Might want to put a fast graphics card in and try and do VT-d to Windows for gaming
9. This is the cheapest video card I could find. I need VGA 640x256


The alternative is something like this

AT&amp;T Uverse Gateway (DHCP server) -&gt; Linksys Wifi AP -&gt; endpoints in 192.168.1.0 network

I have a cisco 800 series ISR router, plug the 2960 into a LAN port on the ISR880, and have that all be the 192.168.2.0 subnet.

I've taken the first steps and connected the 880's WAN port with a LAN port on the AT&amp;T Gateway. The ISR 880 is serving as a DHCP server for the 192.168.2.0 network, and I'm able to browse the internet, ping devices on the 192.168.1.0 network and all works well.

The problem is that any device on the 192.168.1.0 can't ping anything on the 192.168.2.0 network. I'm assuming this is because the AT&amp;T gateway doesn't know how to do any actual routing

Any suggestions on how I can get this working so that devices on the 192.168.1.0 can ping to the 192.168.2.0 network? I was thinking of connecting the 880 using the L2 ports on the back, and then setting up an SVI to route between the two networks. Does that sound plausible?

I've never setup an infrastructure from starch and need advice on where to start how to proceed. While I probably don't need separate VLANs for a home lab I think it would be a good exercise. I will probably put this on the back burner until I figure out a solution that I'm happy with.

1371402985.0,1ggnt1,[Server Build Help] I have an FX-8350 AMD CPU and need some help from you fella's.,utp216,2,3,3,"Hey fella's. I've got the FX-8350 CPU and an older 890fx chipset motherboard at the moment. I have heard that 990 chipset boards are the way to go. Please check this MicroCenter link of all the AM3+ motherboard and let me know what you would buy if you were in my situation.  

Thanks a bunch!

1365432361.0,1bx43p,"Need CPU, MB, Ram &lt;$200",joshlove,3,2, and a few 500gb HDDs (3gb/s though) and a few vid cards I could choose from.

The processor/ram/mb are all a little old (older athlon 64

I'd like to set up ESXi on whatever I pick both to learn it and to support some other learning I want to do (Puppet

For other VMs I'm thinking mostly low powered/low needs VMs just for learning some of the technologies I mentioned above. Maybe 3vms at a time + the streaming server vm (which I'll allocate more ram etc to)

So I'm looking for a good MB/CPU/Ram combo to start out.

I keep thinking that the quad core AMD processors I'm seeing for ~80 and accompanying MBs for about the same price and 8gb of ram (2x4gb) is the way to go for around $200.

Here's the amazon wishlist I've been keeping this stuff under (I have prime so the free 2 day shipping is nice)

Any glaring problems?


Thanks in advance!
