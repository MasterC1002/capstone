2 Days ago on Monday I visited 4Rivers and posted a review which gathered a little over 90 comments: http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/18rwts/4rivers_of_disappointment/
Yesterday

Today, who treated me as if I owned the place. Literally. Mike was very excited about me trying pretty much everything they had on the menu, seriously. This guy should be a politician, seriously you should go there and ask to see him he'll make you want to vote for him somehow. He said he will personally put together a plate for me and that he would like this to be on the house. After nearly 10 minutes of debating with him my refusal to this offer(because that's not what I came back here for) and that I would REALLY like to pay for my food, he accepted and charged me 9$ for this: http://imgur.com/fZnqula

Which was their brisket

Redemption. At its best. The brisket........ Aw man. The food, you take a fork and you run it down the bone and all the meat falls off. You don't even need a knife for the brisket either because of its tenderness. Everybody agrees including myself from the first time I went there, that the sides are very good, and they were great this time as well. After I could barely finish my tray(s) and find a way to get up and walk, I went over to thank Mike and he introduced me to the Kitchen manager and another manager. I told Mike the only problem this restaurant still has is the fact that I live in Kissimmee.

But this post isn't only about the food. It's about 4Rivers as a restaurant. Here I am, inviting me to their restaurant for an epic meal on them, to gain 1 customer. One. Because they could have easily ignored the post, since I'm like that one guy that yells in Walmart: ""I'm never coming here anymore!"" Well nobody cares, you're just 1. If that's not BRILLIANT customer service, I don't know what is. 4Rivers have definitely   won themselves a customer.

On Sunday I had made a desperate post on both Reddit and Facebook-Reddit for hands to help me move. I received a lot of initial offers but as the hour approached I began to get less and less confirmations. Thankfully, to say the least. Everyone moved with speed and was not reluctant to grab the heaviest of things. I felt like I had known these guys for years within minutes.

We finished the first house and made it to the new apartment. There were only two guys that showed up, we received help from our neighbors below us! Five extra hands at the exact moment we needed it the most. Those four flights of stairs were brutal, but it never felt like work with the good energy everyone was exuding.

We finished within an hour and everyone was dripping sweat but in great spirits. A quick water/beer break and we were on to my house. The loading was quick

What started at 8am was competed by 12:45 (this includes a trip from Winter Park to UCF; UCF to Golfway and Alafaya (G and A); G and A back to UCF) and what better way to celebrate than with Lazy Moon and a few sandwiches. Over lunch we told stories about our past

A quick about me, and I don't think enough has been done by the current Sheriff in that regard. I have been campaigning constantly (you may have seen my billboard up: http://i.imgur.com/Y8QZS.jpg) and hope that your questions and my answers today serve to help in your decisions on voting.

I have made a personal pledge to resign if I am not able to reduce crime by a significant percentage (20%) within my first year as Sheriff. I have also pledged to donate half of my salary to local charities. It is my belief that a Sheriff should be all about serving the community he swears to protect and that this donated money can help that community more than I need it. I also want people to see I am VERY serious about my belief that new strategies can be quickly implemented and be extremely effective in combating crime here.

So please

Thank you to everyone again for all of their questions. I like seeing there are still many who get involved in local politics.

Second Edit: Thank you for all the great questions Reddit. There were a lot more of you than I expected. I hope everyone who asked me questions got what they think is a straight answer from me. Like I said in a few answers, thank you for that. Remember to vote! If you don't, your voice cannot be heard.

1348862733.0,10mvvn,Vote NO on Amendment 8,bobandgeorge,105,21,41,"http://election.dos.state.fl.us/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=10&amp;seqnum=86

Amendment 8

Religious Freedom

Synopsis: Amendment 8 revives long-standing 
debates over the separation of church and state. It 
would repeal a 126-year-old provision in the state 
Constitution that prohibits taxpayer funding of 
religious institutions. The provision – commonly 
known as the “no aid” provision – states more 
unequivocally than the U.S. Constitution that state 
funds not be spent “directly or indirectly” in support 
of any entity that promotes religion. If passed
the amendment would remove that prohibition. 
An important aspect of Amendment 8 concerns 
its impact on future school voucher programs. 
Past programs that included religiously affiliated 
schools have been deemed unconstitutional partly 
due to the “no aid” provision. Amendment 8 would 
remove that obstacle to restarting these programs
which allow parents to remove students from 
failing public schools and send them to private 
schools at taxpayers’ expense. Supporters say the 
“no aid” provision discriminates against religious 
organizations. They argue this proposal offers 
support to groups with religious affiliations that 
provide valuable community services
ministries or church-run after-school programs. 
Opponents say Amendment 8 will divert money from 
public schools and other public funding recipients 
and that it blurs the separation of church and state. 
Opponents point out that many religious groups
such as Catholic Charities
funding under the current law provided they do not 
promote their religion.

**A vote YES on Amendment 8 would:**

• Repeal the “no aid” provision in the Florida
Constitution and allow public money to go to private 
religious institutions

• Allow the expansion of Florida’s school voucher
program to religious institutions and could result in 
money being directed to private religious schools at 
the expense of public schools

• Allow for a greater number of religious programs to be supported by taxpayer funding

**A vote NO on Amendment 8 would:**

• Maintain the “no aid” provision in the state 
Constitution that prohibits the government from 
funding religious institutions and groups that promote 
religion

• Maintain the constitutional provision the courts have 
cited when rejecting school voucher programs that 
fund religiously affiliated schools

• Maintain the separation of church and state as 
provided by the state Constitution since 1885

When I ask you for your ID, please do so without grumbling or acting like it's a huge imposition.   I don't care how old you think you look, or how young it makes you feel, or how many times you've been here and I should know you by now.  Just be polite and give me your ID.  A lot of bars have a policy where even if you're 80 years old, you have to have your ID to get into the bar. It's an insurance thing.  I may recognize you, or know that you're of age, but I still have to see that yes indeed

Please don't be grabby with your ID; some people like to hand it to me, or act impatient because I'm holding you up.  I am doing my job.

""Don't you know me by now?""  Probably not.  I see hundreds of different faces every single night.  I know that you want to feel special, I promise. If my bar is in a crowded area like downtown or just a popular spot? I might see literally *thousands* of faces every single night. My interaction with you is saying hello, checking your ID, and letting you walk into the bar.  It's not like we hang out at the bar and talk, or you tip me, or I remember your drinks.  I see you for, on average, and might not let you in.

For the love of fuck, your buddy's...just don't say it. I've heard that same exact joke probably 50 times in the past *hour*. Everyone says it.  It's not funny, you're not original, you're not making me laugh.  Stop.  

Don't drop names or say ""I know the owner/manager/bartender"" if there's a reason I'm not letting you in. It doesn't work.  Half the people that walk through that door say they know the owner. They may know him, please come have your doorguy let me in"".  Don't tell me to call him or text him.  I'll either say no, or I'll fake it, and say ""He said he doesn't know who you are, and he's too busy to come down.""  I hear the same line all the time.  

If I tell you we're full, so the bar is still full. And just because people step outside doesn't necessarily mean you can go in. They might have tabs open and plan to come back (going for a smoke, out to their car, making a phonecall, etc). You can go in when I TELL you that you can go in. This is not me going on a power trip or being a dick to you. This is because, surprise surprise, the bar is at capacity.

Lastly, we're either full or very close to it. Congratulations on your event/birthday/wedding/bachelorette party, and would *love* to accommodate your huge party, but you are coming at the peak of our night, we are likely slammed, and we just CAN'T.  However, if you call ahead that evening, you'd better be on time

Orlando is an awesome city, have a good time, and do our jobs.  If you make that easier on us?   You will have a much more pleasant time out at the bar as well, I guarantee it.",,False,,False,t3_1dahhq

**Health Care Services**

 **Synopsis:** Amendment 1 is more of a political referendum than a meaningful change to our Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has upheld the federal government’s right to impose the individual mandate

**A vote YES on Amendment 1 would:**

• Represent an attempt to opt Florida out of federal health care reform requirements

• Add language to the Florida Constitution that could be found unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution if determined by the courts to be in conflict with federal law

• Prevent the Florida Legislature from passing health care coverage mandates independent of federal law

**A vote NO on Amendment 1 would:**

• Mean that Florida should comply with federal health care reform requirements

• Ensure that the Florida Constitution does not conflict with the U.S. Constitution with regard 
to health care coverage

• Not prohibit Florida lawmakers from passing state laws requiring health care coverage

**Amendment 2**

**Veterans Disabled Due to Combat Injury; Homestead Property Tax Discount**

 **Synopsis:** Amendment 2 relaxes the eligibility requirements for an existing property tax discount offered to disabled veterans. Currently, a veteran eligible for the discount with a 50 percent disability can claim 50 percent off the assessed value of his 
home. Roughly 1, on average, $24,000 from their home’s value before property taxes were calculated. This proposed amendment would give that same tax break to veterans, age 65 and older, who were disabled in combat but living in another state when they entered the military so long as they now claim Florida residency. The state estimates that if Amendment 2 passes, school districts and local governments would lose a total of $15 million over the first three years.

**A vote YES on Amendment 2 would:**

• Give the existing homestead tax exemption to disabled veterans who were not Florida residents at the time they entered military service

• Reduce property tax revenue for schools and local government services by an estimated total of $15 million over the first three years

• Expand the property tax exemption for some disabled veterans who are not currently eligible for a similar property tax exemption

**A vote NO on Amendment 2 would:**

• Not expand the property tax exemption to disabled veterans who were not Florida residents at the time they entered military service

• Not reduce property tax revenue for schools and local government services by an estimated $15 million over three years

• Not place a limitation on state revenue in the Florida Constitution where it would be difficult to modify or remove

**Amendment 3**

**State Government Revenue Limitation**

 **Synopsis:** Since 1995, rent or interest income received in a given year by Florida residents). To date, state revenue collections have never exceeded the cap (largely due to rising personal income and falling tax rates). If passed, Amendment 3 would impose a stricter formula for calculating the revenue limit and, as a result, increase the likelihood it would affect government spending. The new formula would be based on annual population growth and inflation, instead of personal income. Those indicators are considered less volatile than personal income growth and more likely to constrain growth in state revenues. Critics fear the strict revenue limits would affect spending on necessary services like schools and public safety. According to one opposition group, the proposed amendment would result in allowable revenues 26 percent below pre-recession levels (2006-07) by 2025

**A vote YES on Amendment 3 would:**

• Replace the existing state revenue limitation based on personal income growth with a new

• Restrict government revenue (taxes, fines or charges for services) in good and poor economic times

• Limit the Legislature’s ability to increase revenue beyond what the formula allows

**A vote NO on Amendment 3 would:**

• Maintain the existing state revenue limitation based on personal income 
growth

• Protect the state’s ability to provide the current level of government services

• Preserve the Legislature’s current flexibility in responding to budgetary concerns and changing economic conditions",,t5_2qh7s,1348867396.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/10n0l9/the_state_amendments_you_are_voting_for_on/

The cleaning, but we are not able to take insurance.  If you need x-rays, that is an additional $20 (if you want them), but everything else is included, such as Fluoride treatment, local antibiotics if you need them, stain removal, etc.  

Also, I will also pay for them, and that is for anytime before May.  (first come, first served on those!) If you can bring me a child or teen patient tomorrow at 8:30, I'll pay for them *and* give you a kick-ass high five.  Cause that would rock my whole life right now.

That's a lot of words that don't mean anything to most people.

Basically

A Guardian ad Litem is a legal advocate for the child in his or her case.  The GAL serves the ""best interest"" of the child, psychiatric, etc.  The GAL is like their champion.

In Orange County

But because our lawyers also have private practices to attend to

This is where the VAC (Volunteer Advocate) comes in.  As a VAC, mentor, reporter, and advocate for a child who needs it.

It is an excellent opportunity for students who may have service learning requirements for college, or mental health undergrads/graduate students.  HOWEVER, anyone can be a VAC!  I have bankers, PR, realtors, etc., you name it.  All you have to be is willing!

&gt; [Audobon Park Community Market](http://apmarket.wordpress.com/)
_(Winter Park/Audobon Park)_

_When:_ Monday 6:00PM - 10:00PM

_Where:_ Stardust Coffee ([map](http://g.co/maps/xxfw5)).

Awesome selection of fresh local food, jewelry, etc. As a bonus, [Big Wheel](http://bigwheeltruck.com/) is usually out there serving food. I usually get eggs, milk, sea food (every other week from Wild Ocean), and occasionally some dessert from Bee's Knees there. 


&gt; [College Park Farmer's Market](https://www.facebook.com/pages/College-Park-Farmers-Market/330587853090) _(College Park)_

_When:_ Thursday 5:00PM - 9:00PM

_Where:_ Infusion Tea ([map](http://g.co/maps/vtamm)).

Very similar to the Audobon Park market though not quite as packed. Infusion Tea is pretty cool


&gt; [Sand Lake Farmer's Market](http://www.sandlakefarmersmarket.com/) _(Dr. Phillips/Sand Lake)_ 

_When:_ Saturday 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Dr. Phillips and Sand Lake Road([map](http://g.co/maps/zqpgk)).

I haven't been to this one but it looks pretty good.



&gt; [Winter Park Farmer's Market](http://www.cityofwinterpark.org/Pages/Visitors/Shopping_Dining_and_More/Saturday_Farmers_Market.aspx) _(Winter Park)_

_When:_ Saturday 7:00AM - 1:00PM

_Where:_ 200 West New England Ave

Tons of stuff at this one: milk, cotton candy, vegetables (watch out, not all organic), honey, fruit, vanilla, plants, and their cheese is amazing. Make sure to check out the always entertaining local honey guy.

&gt; [Orlando Farmers Market](http://www.orlandofarmersmarket.com/index.html) _(Downtown)_

_When:_ Every Sunday except holidays from 10am to 4pm

_Where:_ Lake Eola

This is a larger market. You will find fresh produce and vegetables, beverages, etc. This is more of an event to go to. Lots of great food but not as much fresh food as the Audobon/College Park/Winter Park markets. It's more ""shoppy"" then the other markets.

&gt; [Central Park Farmer's Market](http://www.lakemaryfarmersmarket.com/) _(Lake Mary)_

_When:_ Saturday's from 9:00AM - 1:30PM

_Where:_ Lake Mary City Hall ([map](http://g.co/maps/4zc8s)). 

I've passed by this one a couple of times when I used to go to the little organic market that was open there. Looks like a good family spot with some snacks, crafts, and a little bit of food. 

&gt; [Sanford Farmers Market](http://www.sanfordfarmersmarket.com/Sanford_Farmers_Market/Welcome.html)

_When:_ Saturday from 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ East 1st St &amp; Magnolia Ave

I haven't been to this one but it looks like there's a lot of food, soaps, honey, etc.


&gt; [Maitland Farmers Market](http://www.itsmymaitland.com/community-events.aspx?a=viewPost&amp;PostID=13022) _(Maitland/Lake Lilly)_

_When:_ Sunday from 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Lake Lilly Park ([map](http://g.co/maps/v5cbe))

There is one at Lake Lily in Maitland. It was a decent size (smaller than at Eola) with neat finds like homemade dog treats. Haven't been in a couple years so here's more recent info: http://www.yelp.com/biz/maitland-farmers-market-maitland. - Thanks wanderingwanton in the comments!

&gt; [Kissimmee Main Street Farmers Market](http://www.localharvest.org/kissimmee-main-street-farmers-market-M3490) _(Kissimmee)_

_When:_ Year round

_Where:_ Darlington and Pleasant Street

Not a lot of info on this one on the web but check it out if you're local.

&gt; [Clermont Farmers Market](http://clermontdowntownpartnership.com/farmers-market)
_When:_ Every Sunday 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Montrose Street

Fresh produce, seafood, Amish jams and jellies, pasta, fresh baked scones, Italian olive salad and baked veggie chips. You will also find hanging baskets and assorted outdoor plants, hand rolled cigars, craft and jewelry items and much more. The Market always has festive foods like kettle corn

&gt; [Waterford Lakes Farmers Market](http://www.waterfordlakesfarmersmarket.com/)

_When:_ Saturdays 9:00AM - 2:00PM

_Where:_ Waterford Lakes Town Center ([map](http://g.co/maps/xej2v))

Mostly live music, plants, some food and produce.

I feel like I'm missing some here. I had thought that there was one or two on the east side near UCF/Waterford but the only info I could find said the UCF one is closed. I'm not sure if the Waterford market still goes on. Anyone know?

**It's always a good idea to check the web site or facebook page of the market before heading out there just in case it gets cancelled or something.**

Note: I may turn this in to a blog post on my friend's Orlando food blog at some point.

THANK YOU to everyone who has offered to help. I'm blown away by the response. The survivor can't believe so many people want to help him

Hi /r/Orlando

A survivor of torture has recently relocated to the Orlando area, he made up friends to talk to in order to survive the ordeal. He had committed no crime, he had not been sentenced there by a judge.

Amazingly enough, he has helped many people.

He has a place to live but almost no belongings. He has one pair of shorts, enough to get him through the month, but he's lacking in some basic creature comforts. 

If anyone can help

Here are his sizes:

Shorts: Large

Pants: 34 waist

Shirts: L or XL

Shoes: 12

An outreach agency may be able to help him with furniture next week, that would be great, but plan B is in place if not.

Additionally, that would be huge.

Thank you in advance for any help you can give.",,t5_2qh7s,1350320655.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/11gtmh/can_anyone_in_orlando_help_a_survivor_of_torture/

We got a brand new space that is OVER 4000!...sq/ft that is.  We want to show it off.  We want to show YOU what we have in store.

The new space allows a lot more opportunity for us to teach classes we've wanted to teach for a long time.  You've seen me

Here's a quick rundown of some ideas we've had for classes:    

* Screen Printing
* Welding
* Laser Cutting (We own a laser cutter!)
* HAM Radio
* Analog circuitry
* Photography
* Python/Ruby classes
* NodeJS classes
* Metalworking classes (Lathe
* Pottery? (We've got a kiln!)

And some of our ideas for projects in the new space:

* Retro Game Night! (Original NES, N64, Sega)
* Green Screen for video processing
* Wheatley-style service rail with camera accessible from the internet.
* Quadcopter battles
* Solar/Wind power
* DJ Booth
* Maybe let an artist come in and paint the interior?

The NEW address for FamiLAB is **1355 Bennett Drive #129

Come and check out the new place!  We're super excited about it, or what kind of classes you might be interested in!  We're all about learning new things, teaching, and providing access to tools most people normally don't have access to.

1372182134.0,1h1te7,LPT: Traffic Ticket,SigKnight,43,7,61,"Recently a thread popped up on /r/Orlando regarding receiving a Traffic Ticket &amp; how to proceed. I decided I'd throw together a quick post from my experiences with living in Orlando &amp; dealing with a city consistently ranked in the Top 25 Cities with the Most Speed Traps.

**General Tips for Driving:**

* If you're driving on any highway

* Think like a cop. Scout a ways ahead of you on the roadway for sudden brake lights. This is usually a good indication of drivers coming across a police unit. Be wary of any ""hills"" in the road way

* If you see a police vehicle on the side of the road with it's lights on

* Take note of where speed traps are normally setup. Nine out of ten times police will have a routine trap area that they work on &amp; off over the course of a month.

**What to do if you're caught:**

* Immediately Pull Over. 
* Roll down your windows (this will sometimes circumvent an additional tint ticket.) 
* Turn off your radio &amp; move your key to the off position. 
* If pulled over at night also turn on your inside dome light. It helps the officer see into the vehicle from your rear window
* Sit still until the officer approaches your vehicle. 
* Be polite &amp; use yes sir/mam &amp; no sir/mam. 
* Do not admit to anything! Do not state why you were speeding. Do not state your speed. Why? Have you ever noticed that a cop will remain on the side of the road after the other vehicle has left? They jot down notes of their conversation with you in case they need to appear in court. You want to make this write-up go smoothly so they will barely remember the experience.

**Red Light Tickets:**

If you are at an intersection with a red light camera that gets you, ""real"" ticket comes in. (Thanks /u/drjrock!)



**Ticketed

1.) Pay Ticket

2.) Take Traffic School

3.) Hire a Traffic Attorney.

4.) Appear in Court.

Personally I'd recommend number three. Usually prices for civil infraction tickets cost $89-$109. For that price

If you decide to attend Traffic School

Here are the notes on Traffic School from the FDOT's [page](http://dotstrafficschool.com/eligibility.htm):

&gt; After receiving a Florida Traffic ticket

&gt;1. You are eligible to attend traffic school once every 12 months as an election.

&gt;2. You may be able to attend more frequently than once every 12 months

&gt;3. You may be able to attend the 8 hour program if you have already completed the 4 hour program within the past 12 months. Unlike the 4 hour program which has statewide approval

&gt;4. You may only attend traffic school 10 times in your lifetime.

&gt;5. You may attend our on-line traffic school or take the video at home course instead of an actual in-class traffic school. It counts just the same!

Growing up was filled with days and actions that could only be described as pure Central Florida: swimming at Wekiva Springs, fishing Lake Harney/Jessup/Monroe (Jesus, any Central Florida river/lake/creek/retention pond), day trips to St. Augustine, hiking in the woods, swimming and boogie boarding at New Smyrna, etc.  Trips to Disney were supplemented with Florida attractions like Gatorland, and Weeki Wachi Springs.  All the while

It was a perfect place for my childhood

I've noticed that, then to Austin).  Common statements I hear:

""Oh my God

""Disney's so gross.""

""I went there on vacation and can't believe people actually live there.""

""Florida...that's where all the trashiest/weirdest/craziest news stories come from.""

Hell

I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had to deal with this while living outside of Orlando or Central Florida,"" ""It's not as conservative as, say, 95% of Texas or New York,"" etc.

I used to do a few meet ups around this time last year and during the summer

This is in continuation to the other thread that deathbysnusnu is starting. For those that can't make it for Friday, keep that in mind when you suggest a place to hang out.

We can meet up downtown and bar hop, wins.

Thoughts?

**EDIT #1:** So it looks like an overwhelming Wekiva Island/Springs vote. Wayyy cool! Here are some details that we should probably throw down first then:

- **Let's meet up at 11am.** People can still get some sleep from the night before but it's not too late to do anything. I'm going to research a bit more today on a possible meeting area/pavilion that we can congregate at. I'll update you all. I know there are some that may be there a bit later. If so

- **Wekiva Island or Springs?:** Wekiva Island is located in Longwood and Wekiva Springs is located in Apopka. Weird

http://wekivaisland.com/ - Wekiva Island
http://www.floridastateparks.org/wekiwasprings/aboutthepark.cfm - Wekiva Springs

- **BYON (Bring Your Own Noms):** I'm going to try and get a space where we can also BBQ at, hot dogs, starches, beer, etc) so that way we're not all starved by the end of the day or paying when we just don't need to.

**EDIT #2** The biggest edit of all: cost. 

~~Wekiva Springs costs $79.88 to hold a pavilion and that is only the cost of the pavilion.~~ We don't actually need a pavilion to BBQ but I will update you guys with where exactly our picnic table will be. Entrance fees are $6 per vehicle with 8 people a vehicle.

Wekiva Island is $100 to hold a cabana/pavilion but I do not see an entrance fee. 

Keep these prices in mind when you make a decision :)

**EDIT #3** All right so, if you've PMed deathbysnusnu being upset about another meet-up popping out of no where, why? We are two groups of people doing, what it seems, are two totally different things. Some are going to Oblivion and some are going to the park. If it overlaps another meet-up, that bites, but at least this gives you variety for things to do this weekend. Most subreddits don't even have a meet up and you guys now have two of them to choose from (and more if you want to do it yourself). 

**EDIT #4** So here are the final details. We will be headed to Wekiwa Springs located in Apopka, NOT near Sand Lake. If you're going to be late, shoot me a PM, but as an fyi, I may be canoeing with some of the group. The picnic area should be around the Spring itself sooo, this accommodates us in two different ways: 1, we have a central location to essentially meet at and chit chat for a little bit, for those of us who may not want to canoe and just want to relax at the park itself

I'm not sure how much this will help you guys
http://www.floridastateparks.org/lib/img/park/parkmap/wks-map.jpg

You can bring animals as long as they're leashed and not in the water, but being busy and such, you'll get warm. Don't forget to bring yourself some noms! :) Any questions just PM me. I'll be updating this tomorrow morning if there is anything you guys will need to know. If you get lost, I will be reachable via PM.

A group called Occupy Orlando has announced plans to peacefully assemble on Saturday

The specific route for the march/walk appears at this time to be to the Orlando Chamber of commerce

My goal here is to create a comprehensive and detailed list that can be linked to (from the sidebar

If you're all into this idea

* a link to the restaurant's website

* a link to a google map with the restaurant's location. If it's a food truck

* a brief review of the restaurant and what makes it notable

* a quick price estimate for a full meal, $$$ up to 50$/person, $$$$ &gt; 50$/person)

I think we should try to avoid larger chains since the goal here is to showcase what Orlando has to offer, Mellow Mushroom, and probably Tijuana Flats deserve a spot on the list, but I would be hesitant to include something like Melting Pot). If somebody posts a recommendation for a restaurant but there's significant controversy/dissenting opinion, I'll add a note in the review and permalink to the discussion thread. Feel free to use personal opinion in the reviews--it should be clear that this is all local opinion, and not objective scientific FOOD FACT.

 The Eden bar is actually attached to the Enzian theater, aged cheddar, spiced mayo, and your standard burger veggie fixings. Order this rare (no need to worry about contamination issues since it's locally sourced, not factory processed)--the flavor and juicyness of this beef is simply unparalleled. The cocktail menu rotates regularly, but you can always have drinks made to order. I highly recommend the gin mojito--just remember to tip nicely since those things are a pain in the ass to make.

 Hands down *the* best Thai restaurant in Orlando. I've lived here for a long time (probably going on six years now) and have tried *many* different thai restaurants, the ingredients are all on (they use actual chinese broccoli, which seems to be a rarity around here), and the spice levels are actually meaningful (though they can somewhat vary by whoever's in the kitchen that day, ""thai hot"" is almost always *proper* hot). Their massaman and green curries are among the best I've tasted, and I've only had comparable pad thai at one other restaurant (if you ever find yourself in Miami, go check out Tani Thai in Pinecrest).

**Edit Two, like last time, and stay late-ish.  I'm so sorry about the confusion with the other post, there wasn't a conversation had and I'm sure we're just trying to accommodate both parties.  Underage redditors can attend, and you can PM me if you need my number or directions.**

**Edit Three: If I get enough requests for a meetup on Friday, even if it's Oblivion for two nights in a row.** 

Hey dudes and ladydudes.  The last meetup a week and a half ago was a resounding success

HOWEVER! 

A few things: most of us are legally able to drink and really prefer bars with food.  Oblivion was the choice last time and it went very well.  The music was a bit loud for talking, as drinking at a bar can be quite expensive.  Especially if people walk out on their tab.  No, we haven't forgotten, and you know who you are.

ALSO: I am more than willing to host smaller nights for the underage redditors at my apartment.  Or wherever.  Playing Cards Against Humanity was a suggestion a few of us made.

So here it is:  based off the number of posted votes I will be adding edits until we can all agree on a date

I think a Friday

My goal here is to create a comprehensive and detailed list that can be linked to (from the sidebar

If you're all into this idea

* a link to the restaurant's website

* a link to a google map with the restaurant's location. If it's a food truck

* a brief review of the restaurant and what makes it notable

* a quick price estimate for a full meal, $$$ up to 50$/person, $$$$ &gt; 50$/person)

I think we should try to avoid larger chains since the goal here is to showcase what Orlando has to offer, Mellow Mushroom, and probably Tijuana Flats deserve a spot on the list, but I would be hesitant to include something like Melting Pot). If somebody posts a recommendation for a restaurant but there's significant controversy/dissenting opinion, I'll add a note in the review and permalink to the discussion thread. Feel free to use personal opinion in the reviews--it should be clear that this is all local opinion, and not objective scientific FOOD FACT. I'll include a link to the user who submits the review at the end of each entry.

* [Mellow Mushroom](http://www.mellowmushroom.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Mellow+Mushroom,+FL+32817-4607&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=28.561909,-81.218491&amp;spn=0.240327,0.4319&amp;sll=28.532655,-81.330757&amp;sspn=0.240394,0.4319&amp;oq=mellow+mushroom&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=Mellow+Mushroom,+11680+East+Colonial+Drive,+Florida+32817&amp;t=h&amp;z=12)) $/$$

 This is one of two Mellow Mushroom locations in Orlando (the other being in Winter Park). They offer *uncannily* good and uniquely constructed pizzas. You can select base sauces ranging from red to pesto to garlic and olive oil, beyond. You'll be spending a little more cash here than at something like Dominoes, but you truly get what you pay for (the crust in particular is legendary). Eating in or out is an option, and if you dine in you can take advantage of their reasonable selection of beers on tap.

* [Bangkok Square](http://bangkoksquareorlando.com/) ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bangkok+Square,-81.203728&amp;spn=0.12013,0.21595&amp;view=map&amp;cid=17493170291085464363&amp;t=h&amp;z=13)) $$/$$$

 Right on the intersection of University and Alafaya, though.) They have an amazing happy hour special for their food (call them and ask for the time, it seems to be changing around as of late). My boyfriend and I can both go there and gorge for ~$40. They will always make sushi rolls special for you if you ask. However, I don't recommend their desserts because they are rather overpriced for the small portion you get.

The cyclist who struck the car was driving in excess of 80MPH and died a short time after impact. Even though he crashed within 300  feet of a fire medic station (he landed about 400 feet from the station) he could not be saved.

Cars and bikes race up and down Conway road at all hours of the day and night. They pass three schools (and many more crossings for other schools) and countless intersections. I have personally witnessed three fatal accidents on this road ALONE.

I spoke with my vet about it today in great detail and she agreed that, for the safety of my child. 

I can't send him to a shelter -- the odds of someone rescuing a 9 year old dog who does not do well with kids from a shelter is next to nothing.  I don't want him to sit in a cage for years.  I'm at the end of my rope.

This is a last ditch effort to find a home for this very sweet (to adults) dog before I feel that I need to put him down.  I'm very hesitant to put an ad on Craigslist because I'm concerned about dog fighting and him becoming a bait dog. I'd sooner have him euthanized.

 Lam's Garden offers two menus: one is traditional and somewhat underwhelming americanized chinese fare, must usually be specifically requested). Here you can get everything from shark fin soup to jellyfish. Seafood is dominant, but there's quite a bit of excellent terrestrial fare as well. The Peking duck is excellent, and not at all a bad meal for three or four diners (ringing in at around $35). There's usually a complementary after-dinner course of taro tapioca soup and some orange; delicious! They also offer dim sum on the weekends but, while it's good, it's not as good as the nearby Ming's Bistro. *[DISCUSSION](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1joc/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide_mills/c3u6m5z): there are some issues with health code violations at this restaurant.

 Ming Bistro is *the* place to go in orlando if you want some Serious Business dim sum. Prices are cheap, as an added bonus, they have it every day of the week!

 My mom used to live in coastal Mississippi, fried catfish, and plentiful (and cheap) po-boys. As a result, I've become something of a Cajun food snob. The fact that most cajun food you can find in Orlando *isn't* didn't help matters. Then, one day, I found King Cajun Crawfish (I was actually dining at funky monkey and the bartender was telling me how they wanted to buy the nextdoor property--KCC--to expand, amusingly enough). This place brings in actual factual live crawfish for their boils. They also have flash-frozen mudbugs but, it's only like a dollar less. Go with the live option. The seasonings are delightfully spicy, picked up on the culinary style

 Pho 88 is one of the more celebrated Pho restaurants in Orlando, and the seasoning is right. They also have a *fascinating* variety of smoothies, with everything from durian fruit to avocado options (the avocado smoothies are perplexing and delicious, by the way).

The next speaker was a bombastic

The current economic crisis is due to intentional manipulation of the price of labor.  The American people were sold on the terms: ""globalization"" and ""free trade"".  

The migration of rural Chinese into cities resulted in a glutted labor market, in order to cut costs (buzzword ""outsourcing""). Money that corporations make has been repatriated and circulates around the world, avoiding income taxes.  So the jobs left the US, the money left the US, and nothing is coming back in but cheap imports that are barely taxed. 

The solution proposed is to balance cheap labor costs with higher taxes

The 1% pit American's against each other with topics like immigration (it's Mexico's fault!!1!1!)

The meeting closed with speakers from the crowd listing grievances, end corporate personhood, and terminate special interest group involvement with government.

1328720948.0,pgfyg,Do not use Damage Control Emergency Services and do not hire Contractor Andrew Napoli.,Tizzle1219,31,6,10,"We recently had a pipe break, professional and did a good job. Then Damage Control sent us a contractor to do the work on replacing a damaged wall and our entire kitchen. The contractor that showed up was Andrew Napoli

Andrew and his crew showed up and gave us a fair quote, and then did not show again for another few days  even after saying they would be back the next day. When they finally came back Andrew said that the job took a little more money then they first quoted, I agreed that as long as it was just a little more then it was not a huge deal as long as the job got done right.

After another issue of them not showing up when they said they would, and that it was double the original quote, and that they haven't even done half the work they promised to do when they gave me the quote.   
After a long argument with Andrew on the phone about the crappy work that was done so far and the attempt to charge us double the quoted price for half the work

I then called Damage Control and complained to them about Andrew

The next day I noticed the chainsaw I had in my garage was missing

I later decided I was going to do some research on Andrew Napoli and Damage Control and post a site informing others of my experience

So I just want to get the word out that if anyone is in a similar situation and is looking for a company to help with some damage caused by a flood or fire Damage Control is probably not your best choice

Damage Control has recently contacted me asking me to take down a Facebook page I made warning friends not to hire this company or Andrew. Damage Control stated in the letter that my issue was with Andrew and not Damage Control and I need to remove all mention of Damage Control from my page. 

Thing is I was under the impression I had hired a trusted employee of Damage Control to do the work on my house. It was not until things blew up that I was told that Andrew in fact was working under the table and that I apparently did not hire Damage Control

I will update with photos of the crappy work Andrew and his crew did and a link to the archive of the site I had to take down as well as the letter from Damage Control asking me to take the site down.

**TL;DR** Informing people of a shady company and contractor that they shouldn't do business with.

Its a 3 bedroom 2 bath. The bedrooms im renting out are divided by a bathroom. So you have about 6 feet of space seperating your room from your neighbor. You would share a bathroom with one other person. The bathroom has a cool layout so that if you are in the shower theres a seperate door to close. Someone could then still use the sink. The rooms are 15x10 BIG ROOM!!! The rent is $450 a month plus 1/3 utilities each month. This gets you use of pool table, huge tv, electricity, lawn care and water.There is a very nice brunswick pool table thats great to have people come over and play. Its a good house.

Basically, the Magic have been playing extremely well and have scored over 110 in five of the last eight games. So that means 5 times in the last two weeks have been 50% for those who are in the know.

So I know not everyone is in to basketball or the Magic and I want to make sure my fellow Orlando'rs are getting a good deal when they can! I suggest you take advantage of this soon

Just a little info about it. It is a 5K...WITH A TWIST! At the halfway point of the course, PIGLET (3), PIG (6) or the ever impossible and hilarious HOG (12).

This is just a FUN run! We encourage anyone to come out, an MC that will be roasting the people as they attempt to eat their donuts, and a FREE ""Lil' Oinker Fun Run"" for the kids and they get munchkins as a reward for finishing. We also have some ridiculous raffle items for you to win! 

Each person that registers gets 1 free raffle ticket

My wife and I came up with the idea for this race 2 years ago. The first year we had 60 people

Every dollar that we raise goes to a charity called ""Hailey's Hopes and Hugs"" which is a foundation that helps local families that have children with cancer cover their medical costs. 

We would love it if you joined us for a day of fun. There will be an after-party later that day at the brand new ""Nona Blue"" restaurant that is opening in a couple of weeks in Lake Nona.

As a thank you for being a fellow Redditor

Price increases next Friday! It's only $25 right now.

I look in my rearview mirror, and I pull over. He asks me if I know why he pulled me over. I told him ""no"". He said the right turn from Maguire has no turn on red, that whole intersection is like that. I said, yes officer, I know that, but the light was still yellow. He said **if the light was still yellow, I wouldn't be able to pull you over now would I?** (note, *well

I stopped the next morning on my way to work and wanted to get a video to show that when the traffic is coming left off of Colonial and onto Maguire, the traffic coming off of Colonial starts to turn left, but the green arrow to turn right never comes on. I thought I was screwed, and that it really was my fault. Then, the yellow arrow came on, so I knew that the green arrow was out. I figured the cop probably just missed the yellow arrow and assumed I ran the red.

I explained all this to the Ticket Clinic attorney. He told me my video of the faulty light doesn't matter at all. Unless I had video of the incident

 The Rusty Spoon is Orlando's downtown gastropub offering, and has, in my experience, always been spot on. The mixed drinks are good, but not the most impressive I've had (Eden Bar and Ravenous Pig probably tie in that category).

 My favorite pizza in College Park. A great place for a family dinner to shove the kids faces with cheese and dough or to keep an eye on the game while having a nice meal with the lady. Subs, pizza it’s all pretty good. You might as well get a few garlic knots as they are cheap, fresh and dripping in garlicky goodness…and what goes better with pizza that more bread. I’ve had some iffy experiences with their pasta dishes but overall it is great place with solid service. The bar next door (the Local) has the same owners and I believe are the same people who owned the previous pizza place, Alfonzo’s. If you liked Alfonzo’s you’ll like Ragazzi’s. --[deadparts](http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/q1j4o/the_rorlando_comprehensive_restaurant_guide/c3u6dqw)

1366169274.0,1cidrc,Most effective way to petition to the city?,Teslatic,24,4,12,"Hi all

I'm an engineer living in downtown Orlando

It might sound a little frivolous, I assume by doing tricks (grinding rails, etc.) and probably generally just being assholes to local establishments and police. In a desperate bid to put an end to it, it looks like instead of enforcing existing vandalism laws, the city just banned the boards instead. 

The ban from the 1980's probably made the work of police a lot easier by being able to pick out the kids without much effort, but I unfortunately also hear stories of police warnings, actual tickets, and sometimes even reports of impounded boards. Commuting with a longboard is great because you can easily pick it up and take it with you. Once Sunrail opens, the effectiveness of something like a longboard really begins to shine as you can quickly cover that ""last mile"" to and from the station, but also be able to easily take the board on and off the train (compared to something like a bike). 

I can understand the motivations for the original 1980's ban, designed to be an even more effective form of ""last mile"" transportation: (TED talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v19OlWvdUSg). Commuters on longboards will only become a more common sight in cities in the future, and I'd like to do my part to help make sure that Orlando will be one of them. 

Any advice/thoughts anyone can offer?

Basically, and she bit a child after it started roughhousing with her puppies. I don't blame her.
So her owners (supposedly the breeders/abusers) took her to the vet to be put down.

My friend who is a vet tech guilt tripped me into ""rescuing"" her.
I'm a college student. My mom works full time, and we have.

But we don't want this dog. She's great with adults (haven't seen her around kids but she's sweet enough to assume she won't bite one again without major provocation) but BAD with other dogs.

She plays fetch really well and it's pretty much what she lives for. It's cute how she hops like a bunny when you have a ball in your hand.

Anyway, if you can. You can't have any other animals because she gets jealous/aggressive/territorial. I think she's about 5 or 6. 

Good for people

Someone take her. I don't want to have to take her to the SPCA but after biting my cat I don't know anyone who will take her.
Message me if you're interested. I can see about getting you a kennel and bag of dog food as well.

I feel terrible

So, middle aged, Latino guy comes over telling me that I might get ticketed because I'm too far into the other space and helps me correct it.

I get to talking to him and find out his name is Noel. He's homeless. But he works part time doing housing work for a real estate guy who lets him rent a room above his garage right on Lake Ave. He also helps park cars across the street.

He had one felony record on him from 15 years ago when he apparently got in a fight over his daughter. He's a certified chef but lost his job when they ran a background check. No one will hire him because of this one bad mark. He's also capable of doing handy work and apparently fixing cars. His mother passed away recently and left the house to him and his sister. But his sister keeps the house and won't talk to him because he testified against her ex-husband as being violent.

Oh yeah

All in all, and good guy. He's a hustler (in the good sense of the word) down on his luck but I'm hoping he does well. 

I told him I was going grocery shopping. When I came out, and I could actually use the help. I brought him a $10 Publix Gift card and only gave it to him as I was leaving. He's clearly not a drug addict or anything.

So, he's cheerful and just trying to get out of a rut.",,False,,t5_2qh7s,True,,

 So in order to educate her

Here are the burgers(sorry no side view we were starving): http://imgur.com/AYKlE5m

 Left: Hamburger Mary's-----Right: Pine 22.

Allow me to start with a cliché statement: Both were absolutely amazing. I mean Amazing. 

Starting with Hamburger Mary's,the beef patty oh so excellent and succulent and juicy with the right amount of Jack/Cheddar covering it. To top it off was a perfectly cooked onion ring and some BBQ sauce. The burger was amazing, but the fries were damn perfect. Each fry was a perfectly seasoned crispy shell filled with silky mashed potatoes. Not one fry was flaccid, soggy or stale. 

On to Pine Twenty 2, which is why I liked it better. The char on the burger gave the patty an amazing kick and the juice rendering from it didn't do any harm either. The cooked onions and the melted gruyère cheese lifted the burger to another level of perfection. The matchstick or allumette fries on the other hand... were ok. I don't mind thin cut fries, but I do mind soggy limp flaccid fries, and unfortunately the fries were exactly that at pine twenty 2.

Is there anything that I should really be aware of. From what I can tell the weather seems to be similar to Sydney some days hot sometimes cold and rainy. Would it be reasonable to assume ill be able to get some pool time or is it still mostly miserable around the end of January?

Also in regards to the theme park tickets. Is the best place just to book on the website?

My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'. We'll be in Orlando this Tuesday and Wednesday.Wanna be our next breakfast stranger on Wednesday the 14th??

* [Breakfast with Strangers mainsite](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page - please like us](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'Orlando' in the subject line. Send us an email at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com.


**More details about our project**

On July 18, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027


**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

It's on a river and there are free canoe rentals (my favorite part) if you're in the mood for a paddle down the Little Econ.


**Money:** It's about 500 dollars a month which includes water and trash. Electricity is usually about 130 but we could definitely get it lower. There would be no move in fee and the security deposit is already covered.


**Furry Friends**
I have one cat but we're keeping her under the radar because of pet rent. IT's like 100 dolllars down and then 10 dollars on the rent each month. If you have a cat or small dog you'd like to bring they are more welcome but then I think we should tell the apartment and start paying pet rent :)


**Personal Things**
I am a pretty laid back person. The person moving in would have to be 420 friendly. The only place in the apartment I really care that is clean is the kitchen because of roaches. I am an art and psychology major with interests in history and astronomy

My surprise in all of this is that she does not appear or sound homeless, Here I am talking to a woman who by all accounts is 'better' than me and this is how harsh the world has been for her.

We talked, really to no avail because I cant imagine being in her position yet I try to offer whatever I can to her.

Long story short

Where are the job opportunities

She had her License taken away from her by a cop and needs to go to the DMV to get at least a photo ID. She has her social security card and recently got kicked out of lake eola by the police

Can anyone help to get this woman back on her feet ? What is the best course of action when she goes to the DMV to get an ID ?

I'm doing all of this because I would personally hire her. She does not come off like she is in the situation she is in

Are there any shelters or churches she can go to ? 

She has no phone

If anyone can offer any help

If anyone can help ME to help HER or even better if anyone can help HER directly

He was very interested in the idea and would love to try it. When I asked about putting it on a couple of tvs, to make sure the connection can handle a stream. Then the first official one would be for IPL4 (which IGN's site claims will be ""late February"").

*Do sign wave events over the next few days and post footage on youtube.


I'm open for additional ideas as well.  I think the door to door method will be the most effective.  

TL;DR - Sandy Adams can help stop SOPA.  Let's take action.

Also there is Blue Spring State Park and it is absolutely beautiful. The water is so blue is almost glows. You can rent tubes here

Rock Springs is also a nice park. You usually rent intertubes (inner tubes? idk) and float down a natural lazy river. It is gorgeous. Bring goggles!! When I went there when I was a kid I used to find sharks teeth at the bottom

Another park I really like is Tosahatchee State Park off of 50. This one doesn't have water but it's a really nice place to hike and bird watch. I LOVE camping here

Lastly, is also called the State Forest? It's in Oveido. It's also a dry one but it's good if you like to bike on dirt trails and appreciate nature. It's fun to bike because there are a lot of little obstacles to figure your way through! There are also equestrian and hiking trails here.

My story, if needed...
I am a 28yr old Us Army Vet with 2 tours in Iraq, and emotional detachment problems I am working on with the VA. I am currently unemployed, broke, using food stamp cards to eat. My GF, Ashley, works at Chili's to supply us with enough cash for Power and internet
.
I live at home in my mother's foreclosing house in Clermont, and life saving money, and ran off to Taiwan to never be heard from again, yes the divorce is in the process, but the property settlement is delayed because my mothers lawyer died in a car crash, no joke. Our family credit is ruined because the job market in FL is atrocious, I cant even get a job at Mc'Donalds.

I atteneded Full Sail University in Winter Park, my father, with him gone and my credit ruined I couldnt get a 2nd loan. So my funds ran out. Some of you Vets / Miltary folk will ask why not use the GI Bill... I was using the Pre 9-11 GI BIll to pay for bills when I was in school. Full Sail is a accelerated school, its a BA in 2 years, each class is only 1 month instead of 2. You goto school for 8 hrs a day every day, plus homework and projects, you really dont have ANY time to work. So I paid for bills using the GI money, but I owe them 20 grand for the Previous Balance of Tuition

Now here's the shit that REALLY Sucks. My house is a GAS house. We cant Afford the gas so we let them come take the propane tank. That means we have no hot water, my home AC unit compressor just broke. So for the last year, we have been taking cold ass showers, and using a Toaster Oven to cook dinner on, along with a microwave. Our choices of food style are limited.... Just recently the AC Broke. It is now 90 + Degrees in my house with windows open and fans in the windows.

I dunno what to do, you just wake up in sweat. My GF cant even get good sleep and yet she has to wake up and go to work every day or so. As a Man I feel worthless because I cant provide for her, and as a person, my living conditions are only upgraded from a homeless person which, unless I get back into school soon, I will be.

I dont know what to do, a favor called in from some one that knows of an AC Repair guy. A way to get a small loan for some one with bad credit. ANYTHING.... I have an Electric hot water heater, an Electric stove to trade or sell, (we cant afford to get the house wired for Electric Appliances)... If any one knows of some one that can get me a Job... Anything...

When:  Tuesday

Orlando Public Library

101 E Central Blvd

Orlando

Why do we see colors? Why don’t our eyes detect all wavelengths of light? Why is the sky blue and why are sunsets so colorful? Together with planetary scientists Dr. Addie Dove and Tracy Becker, and look at examples of how to change the way we see objects everyday. We will also learn how astronomers use telescopes that observe at different wavelengths of light to better understand our universe.

Tracy Becker is a graduate student in the physics department at the University of Central Florida on the Planetary Sciences track. She studies Saturn’s rings using data from the Cassini spacecraft

Addie Dove, and as the Laboratory Manager for the Center for Microgravity Research and Education (CMRE) there. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Colorado in May, 2012. Her thesis work was focused on the lunar plasma and dust environment, and her research expertise also includes lunar dust adhesion. At the CMRE, she leads laboratory-based studies of the behavior of planetary regolith in reduced gravity and normal gravity environments making use of parabolic airplane flights, suborbital rockets, the International Space Station, and Co-Creator of the Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon).

PETS ARE WELCOME.  SO ARE CHILDREN.  Just getting that out of the way.

Here is the original post: http://redd.it/1e1gat

We have created a facebook group for this event.  My friend /u/bootybyhershey will primarily be at the helm

At this point, so we hit all ages and demographics.  Over 120 people have joined the meet-up group, so we are expecting a large turnout, but probably not more than 50.  There has been a lot of discussion about adverse weather, which, examining the forecast, will be a likelihood

That being said, so being realistic, if the weather sucks, our backup plan will probably be a restaurant that also serves alcohol, or someone can volunteer their house and we can have an inside barbecue with board/card/video games and movies.  I would volunteer my house if it weren't so far north of Orlando.

What that restaurant will be is what now needs to be discussed.  I will leave the floor open to those with good ideas, and I will send you my number for texting/calling purposes, or communicate privately that way.

Please let us know if you are attending via a PM, and no one is left confused or wondering what's going on.  That way I can also contact you directly if something changes or falls through, or if we need to arrange rides.

Looking forward to a great meet-up - and seeing familiar faces and new ones as well.

I'm vacationing to Orlando in a week with a group of friends for the second time. We all came here in 2010 after turning 21 and had a blast and are now looking for some more suggestions to make this trip different from last.   

What we did last time: downtown Disney (House of Blues on Industrial Night), Magic Kingdom, and spent most days at the pool except one rainy day we ended up going to some outdoor mall that was near our hotel.  

All we have planned so far this time is to go to Islands of Adventure/Universal for a day or two. Otherwise we'll be at our pool during sunny days and looking for bars/clubs at night.  So I guess I what I'm asking for is some ideas for nightclubs/bars for night and also some emergency rainy-weather type things we can do during the day just in case we can't spend our entire vacation at the pool. Also we will have one male friend with us and would like to bring him to a gay bar :)  So any suggestions for that would be helpful as well! Thanks!   

TL;DR:  Need suggestions for bars and rainy-day activities suitable for mostly girls aged 23-24.

* a link to a google map with the restaurant's location. If it's a food truck

* a brief review of the restaurant and what makes it notable

I think we should try to avoid larger chains since the goal here is to showcase what Orlando has to offer, Mellow Mushroom, and probably Tijuana Flats deserve a spot on the list, but I would be hesitant to include something like Melting Pot).

creative

- a sushi place
- someplace for dessert/coffee
- a bar for drinking after

All the places need to:
- be able to fit 20-25 people and serve us fairly quickly
- be affordable
- fit our Asian theme
- be withing walking distance or a very short drive of each other.

2.  I have an E-Pass account with a transponder (one of the newer ones), it's long since been paid and settled with E-Pass.  How can they ticket me if I've paid the toll?

In addition, they'll suspend my license anyway.  A friend of mine had that happen to him--he got a ticket, paid the fine, then a month later had his license suspended for failure to pay the ticket that he'd already paid.  (I've seen the paperwork and account history from the county for his ticket.  Said friend never received any notices, no tickets or even a notice of suspension, and only found out that his license was suspended when he was later pulled over for speeding.  The officer who pulled him over that time was just as confused as he was as to why his license was suspended.  He wound up having to pay over a thousand dollars to have it reinstated, too
