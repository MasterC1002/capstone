So usually, it in fact acted as a ramp to funnel dropped items *into* the vent.

I don't want to leave a piece of ham festering down there, I could probably resign myself to jabbing at random with a sharp implement for 45 minutes to an hour, but like a genius, I dropped a screwdriver down there too and need to get that back also.

I've attempted to dig up any kind of detailed drawings online as to how this thing is assembled

Worth noting is the fact that I can't get my arm in there, which is why I've resorted to taking some of it apart rather than fishing endlessly.

So I guess my main question is

Failing that

Otherwise

Or maybe try to find someone with smaller hands.

If you need more details on anything

Thanks guys.

I think I found the right material for it.  I need to lay one layer down on the ground

This is a few pics of the condition they left it in after building it.  Their ""fix"" was to come back and put in a few strips of 1x4 strapping which I'm going to have to remove.

Should I be pushing the polyethelene up where the insulation is and nail it in?  Or do I need to just run huge strips along the length of the crawlspace.  It's about 1300 sq ft and I'll probably be doing it myself.

Had the revelation to check there, popped the back, no capacitors (of the pop cap kind, something within my skill to replace) but it was pretty dirty. Took and air can and blew out the dust on both sides of the PCB board really well, and wiped of any remaining grime. Took some pictures in case it didn't work. Put it back together and boom goes the dynamite. Flawless, no glitching, no inverting. Played for an hour. Thanks for the advice and help you guys!",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1g6qh5/firm_believer_in_not_throwing_out_old_game/

I've had my window open all day (UK, nothing heavy) and I'm trying to close it at the moment and it wont close.

I've tried a few things, perfectly fine. 

I've now just noticed that there appears to be a bit of damanged plastic on the underside of the corner. It appears to be stopping it fitting in perfectly to the fixture bit for the mechanism thats on the frame.

Anyone know how to deal with this? I was thinking of maybe sanding it down to the right size again?

Would that be a good way to deal with it?

I have been renting one side of a duplex for about a year while I look for the right house to buy.  It is heated by natural gas, gas meter, etc).  I moved in early last Fall before it got cold enough to turn the heat on.  Over the course of the winter, I would notice a sewer-like smell on the first floor of the duplex (mainly the living room and kitchen) from time to time.  The smell never seemed to make its way up to the second floor.  I could occasionally smell it outside, but not as often as I smelled it in the house.  I mentioned it to my landlord a few times, but nothing ever seemed to come of it.  I could never predict when the smell would be noticeable, and every time I wanted him to come smell it for himself

In the spring, but eventually the smell went away.  I didn't notice it again in the apartment all summer.

A week or two ago, and of course the smell was gone.  We tried forcing the furnace on to blow hot air (adjusted the thermostat), but we couldn't force the smell to come.  I thought the smell might be related to the furnace because it didn't start again until the exact day I turned the heat on.

We experienced a few warmer days this week, the smell in the living room was strong again, despite the furnace being off.

I know very little about home repair and maintenance.  After speaking with a few people, and the smell was strong this morning.

**Background**

I bought a house in South Florida about 2 years ago and up until this past weekend everything has been fine with it.  On Friday night we had a really strong rain storm come through and quite a bit of rain all day on Saturday.  Sunday morning I noticed the carpet in the living room where my dog's bed is was soaked through to the padding. The first thing I did was pull the carpet and padding up and dry vac'd about a gallon of water out of the padding and carpet.  I called a leak inspection company Monday morning and scheduled for them to come out on Tuesday morning to find the source of the leak.

** Leak Inspection Results**

The guys that came out did a quick assessment of the window area and determined that two windows had cracked seals that needed to be repaired.  They used an IR device to check for moisture in the walls and that's when things got really interesting.  Basically the external facing wall with the window contained heavy amounts of moisture

Where this goes downhill very quickly and becomes really scary and intimidating is that a further inspection on the rest of the house with the IR device shows high levels moisture in all the exterior walls in the house.  These were his notes from the inspection:

* Inspection of the home (thermal) found the exterior of the home does have many small crack's and no sealer left in paint causing wind driven rain to hold in wall's.
* Found front window seal's cracked and allowing wind driven rain to enter unit (This is what I called him to find)
* Thermal test does show moisture in ceiling and walls
* I recommend a roofer to test the roof.
* Must fix all cracks / reseal exterior and paint to stop all water intrusion.

At this point I'm starting to feel like Tom Hanks in The Money Pit.  The guy just gave me a verbal estimate of $30k to fix the visible water damage that I called him to inspect for me

** Things I've Done **

* I called in a claim with my insurance company
* I've contacted a public adjuster who has already been to the house to give his feedback.  He said that I will most likely have to cover the costs of getting the leaks fixed myself and the house painted/sealed.  However, etc should be covered by insurance.

* I've contacted a roofing company to come give an inspection on the roof.

* I've contacted a painting company to come out to give an estimate on sealing and painting the house.

** Questions **

I think that I'm pretty well set for the actual issue that I called the leak inspector out for.  Now I'm just kind of wondering what my options are for the rest of the house where no visible water damage has occurred.  

* How worried should I be from the IR scan?  Right now I'm visualizing myself in a scene from The Shining and all the blue spots on the IR scans are blood dripping from the walls :(.

* Is it normal to see moisture on an IR scan after a heavy rainstorm? I don't really have a comparison to compare to so I'm just going off what this guy said.  If I would have scanned houses up and down my street

* My understanding is that the biggest risk from water damage is when mold and mildew sets in.  If I get the house sealed up ASAP

I've pretty much narrowed the problem down to airflow. I'm just not sure on how to go about testing the components in the fresh food section to determine if it's a mechanical problem with the damper or if it's a thermostat problem. Any suggestions?

Edit: To clarify I'm pretty sure the airflow problem is not a defrost issue. There's no ice buildup in the evaporator area. Also

Edit #2: Looks like even if I did track down exactly which part was faulty the only way to buy a replacement is to get the whole $200 kit which includes the damper control and the cold controls. I'm still going to pop the assembly open first to see if it's something silly but I'm not holding my breath.

Final Edit: For future searchers who happen on this post - I thought it would be nice to edit in how I resolved it. I took the damper assembly out and didn't see anything amiss so I wedged the flap open so I could determine if doing so would lower the temperature in the fresh food section (of course don't let it run for long like this). Airflow was fine when I did this and the temperature dropped.

As I mentioned above - even if I could pinpoint the exact fault (damper, capillary tube, etc.) the only replacement part that is sold for this section is a kit that contains all of these parts so for a DIY job that was my only remaining option. The part is #5304482075.

I now know I should have embedded it and started there.  This is the start of my nightmare.  The tiles were original to the house (1969) and were cracking and coming up without any effort.  I sped the process up by taking up the tiles

The bare floor now (shown in the picture) is very smooth and flat.  According to my brother (mind you


A gal from the home depot-type of store showed me several options and kept telling me to do the ""self-adhesive"" stick on tile because it was fast

1356329981.0,15d2t9,House mains electrical help.,jowabe,11,1,6,"This afternoon while the wife and I were wrapping presents it seemed that we blew a fuse. After the fuse is swapped out we still had no power to that section of the house. So we went and bought new fuses just to make sure the ones we had weren't bad. We pop in the new fuse and still no power. After some trouble shooting I determined that one of the mains fuses was bad so we replaced that. Still... No power. After some more trouble shooting I found that one of the lines to the mains fuse didn't have any power to it. There are four mains fuses and each of the others had power. This was determined using a no-contact meter. This is what I believe to be a typical electrical installation in the US Midwest. 

My question is; what gives? Is it possible that one of the lines from the meter to the fuse box is disconnected?

1376400339.0,1k9y7n,I need help turning a deck in to a roof for a porch,Dark_Prism,14,5,15,"The title may be a bit confusing so I'm hoping I can clarify here:

I rent a ground floor apartment that has a similar apartment above it. Being on the ground

As we pay more for a ground floor apartment for the very reason of having a ""roof"" over our porch I somewhat expect to be able to have said ""roof"" offer cover from the weather.

So I want to close those gaps in some way so that we can be outside when it's raining. We have a dog that we can't leave outside on her own per community rules (probably wouldn't want to

So far I have tried two things which I didn't entirely expect to work but that were low cost and relatively easy to implement. The first was to use duct tape over the gaps. This failed in exactly the way you expect. The second try was to take a tarp and staple it up to try and funnel the water away. This failed because there is no way to attach the tarp that doesn't allow for water to pool in it which then pulls the whole thing down from the weight.

I currently have two more ideas but one of them which I know for certain will work could be more expensive than I think I can afford.

The first idea is pretty simple. I would fill the gap with something like [this GREAT STUFF™ Big Gap Filler](http://greatstuff.dow.com/products/big-gap-filler/). The only potential problems I see with this would be the color (I would probably want to get spray paint to hide it)

The second idea would be to get some kind of channeling (or PVC pipe cut in half length-wise) and use something like Flex Seal to seal it over the gap. The problem I worry about here is the cost of material and, a Dremel, and a drill.

So basically I'm looking for advise before I try something else and potential waste more time and money.

The AC has not been able to keep up with the hot days lately (90-100 Degrees). It is usually able to catch up at night and it will be cool in the morning

I think I have identified some things. One, feel for other holes and tape them up, and hopefully try my hand at replacing the bad duct. 


My questions are:

1. In replacing the duct

2. Does my attic have adequate insulation? If not

3. How does my attic look for ventilation? Do I need to add more? Can I just put more on top of the existing?

4. Would a radiant barrier be a good idea/worth the money?

This is the shortest venting path possible. The horizontal run and vent hood is all new as of last September. I have had the dryer since moving last year and it operated for several months before there was any sign of trouble. I have now replaced the thermal cut-off fuse twice

Each time it has failed, so I thought the logical assumption was that the thermostat was failing to open, which then caused the thermal cut-off fuse to fail. However, I didn't test this hypothesis by heating up the thermostat and seeing if the circuit would open.

I replaced both the thermal cut-off fuse and the high-limit thermostat using the OEM parts in [this kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XLDDNI). Less than two weeks later, since a properly operating high-limit thermostat should prevent such a scenario from occurring, but I decided to double-check all the exhaust vents. I thoroughly vacuumed out all venting inside the dryer, replaced the transition vent from the dryer to the wall, and cut the portion of the vent which protrudes from the wall down to 3/4"" in order to facilitate air flow. Then I replaced both the thermal cut-off fuse and the high-limit thermostat for a second time.

That was two weeks ago, cutting off power to the heating element, well before the thermal cut-off fuse fails. This time I plan on testing the thermostat thoroughly by heating it in an electric skillet to make sure that it opens as expected at the proper temperature.

Before I buy a third replacement kit, I would be happy to take recommendations for any similar product designed to be installed in existing drywall.)

Here is a picture of the [heating element assembly](http://i.imgur.com/PiVxt1vh.jpg)

**EDIT**: Additional findings so far:

* Double-checked and the voltage at the wall is 241V
* I used an electric skillet to test the high-limit thermostat. It works just fine
* There's no short between the heating element and its housing.

**EDIT 2**: I've disassembled the unit and am working on cleaning out all the lint from the motor and blower. The thermal fuse and the cycling thermostat both test OK for continuity,,False,self,t5_2rf27,1368545914.0,,True

I've run into an issue with starting the engine on my mower.

This is a Briggs and Straton model series 28P700 12-14hp on an 1998-ish Dixon 4423 ztr mower.

Previously, and then runs fine. Won't start in not-choke usually, unless its warm.

**What happens now:**


1. Insert, as usual.
2. Turn key to crank. Starter turns the engine
3. Continue cranking


I know the old 'air, and everything seems to be in the right place.

* I've replaced the spark plug today, but its cheap. Still didn't work.

* Fresh fuel (though the tank was close to empty initially

* The air filter could be cleaned (and will be) but its really nowhere near dirty enough to impede starting/running of the engine.

So

There is a deadman switch on the seat which will kill the spark to the engine  so I may check that out this evening. But it cranks

Maybe some schmutz got in the carb? but the spark plug smelled like gas when I replaced it

I will try taking the air filter off as well to see if that will indicate the problem...


Edit: I replaced the valve-cover gasket a few weeks ago

Edit2: maybe the throttle cable is off somehow and it isn't getting into Choke like it usually requires? I'll manually set that when i get home to try it again.


EDIT3: PROBLEM SOLVED&gt; the power wire leading eventually to the magneto was pinched between the starter and block. They had been there for about a year or so

1. The elbow still has about an inch of the other pvc pipe glued inside of it (pictured).  I don't think I can remove that little bit, which would throw everything off.  I have some leeway to move the whole thing up, so shortening the vertical pipe on the left isn't a problem, but shortening the horizontal pipe coming off of the left-most elbow would be an issue.

The burner for the oven[not for the stove] lit up after sometime and the flames were small[about the size of a low flame from the stove burner]. Blowing on the flames made them rise up higher[more than the size of a high flame on the stove] and made the oven heat up faster. By blowing on the oven burner for almost 10 minutes

What do you think the issue is and can I fix it by myself? If I have to call in a professional

Please let me know if any part of this is not clear and I will try my best to explain.

But... let's start a little ways before the incident. The house was built in 1954, basement is the size as the uptairs but unfinished. The previous owner was, with what he did to the home being the only evidence corroborating this sentiment, a madman.

The basement was his model train workshop and home. It's a pretty standard affair. Tiling on the floor for the model train home. A workbench, really). Of course, if one is at the work bench, they see there's a mirror pointing to the basement door, a wooden closet door reinforced with metal beams and cabling, the door frame complete with a metal bracket on each side, looking like one could reinforce the door and its three locks with a wooden beam or broomstick. When you try to walk up the basement stairs into the house, uneven

And one winter

We came to this realization: The dining room, as did the basement. The dryer had its own circuit, but the washer when it was upstairs was on the multi-bedroom plug circuit (so you couldn't watch TV and do a load of wash at the same time), but we moved into the basement and now it's on the standard basement circuit. There's an outdated, defunct security system on its own breaker. The electric water heater and HVAC unit have their own respective circuits.

Somehow

So

The house started acting weird. Weirder than usual. My fiancée came to the house, the house had suddenly become haunted.

I got off work, but little else) and checked the panel. Nothing was tripped. I threw all the breakers, then the main. And I threw everything back on.

The plug for the washer registed 37 VAC. That was unusual. I then checked something more sincere--the water heater. It takes 240 VAC (two poles of 120 VAC), and we have 240 VAC.

The rest of the house confirmed this. We unplugged everything except the refrigerator--too much food to lose, and they were getting it. Plus, it was 100 degrees out with a lovely level of humidity. There was no way we could subject ourselves to that.

The next morning, and asked one of the guys, a former electrician, what it could be. He stated it could potentially be a bad neutral in the breaker, probably on the main breaker. Confident that I could inspect itself, he described what to look for.

And what I was looking for wasn't there. Or rather, everything went 200 VAC/40 VAC. When that breaker was off, I could turn on my computer with little problem. Everything the house worked like nothing happened, but I only tried a piece at a time.

I was on to something.

But I was wrong.

I thought we had a bad breaker that pulled too much in its favor to the neutral. This breaker also had the refrigerator--the precious commodity we were so desiring. Damn heat and air

We sealed our fate. The fridge is gone, if the fridge is off.

Turning on the lights in the attic also dimmed lights elsewhere in the house. If you used something on one circuit, it turned 200 when a low powered circuit was energized (that is, something was plugged in or a light was turned on). There was obviously a massive imbalance.

So here comes my question: What could be wrong?

Aside from the obviously bad wiring planning that needs to be taken care of so that each breaker is taking an appropriate load

Obviously--we're getting an electrician in at some point and the electric company doesn't want to talk to us either. Having said that

**TL;DR** My house is haunted. Half the circuits are giving too much voltage

**[EDIT 12:48 CDT] Update** -- Mario, but somewhere it's still giving us power. He suspects, however, while that's a problem, we still have faulty or otherwise bad breaker/refrigerator as a culprit. Because if the refrigerator is not plugged in, all the outlets read the same.

I suspect otherwise, he is a professional and I work on water heaters over the phone for a living. And we need to get that house rewired anyway.

**[EDIT 15:02] Update** -- Mario might have been a tad too wrong. I had a feeling this would be the case. The lights started fluctuating badly, but we need to get the main neutral fixed. Our neighbor has no power at all, which suggests that we're not the only one's affected by this.

1335228084.0,sp49d,Update: Furnace motor replacement,unsailedbard,9,1,1,"**TL;DR** *Thank you

I just wanted to say thank you to the Fixit community for helping me replace the electric motor for the blower fan in my furnace.  I [originally posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/rgj1m/how_much_damage_would_detergent_oil_do_to_a_motor/) to ask for information regarding the effects of a lubricating oil with detergents on a motor which called for a non-detergent oil.  The help I received from **mbstang**

After a failed attempt to find a proper replacement motor at my nearest HVAC Supply

Getting the motor out was a slightly difficult.  My furnace uses a ""direct-drive"" motor instead of a ""belt-driven"" motor, blower fan and mounting bracket in one piece, and then disconnected the wires connecting the motor to the control circuit inside the furnace.

After removing the blower fan and mounting bracket, and I was headed back home.

Once home, so I took my time comparing the wiring diagram on the inside of the furnace with the control circuit.  After I was positive I had identified everything from the diagram, I started to plan my attack.

The old motor was so ancient, Black and Red are ""hot"" lines, Green is ground and White is for the ""common"" or return path.

The old motor used a black wire to connect to the ""hot"" black wires of the control circuit, here I was connecting a white wire to a black wire, where previously a black wire had been connected to a black wire.  I was not happy.

After calling my girlfriend's father, the hot line connected to the return path on the motor, because the motor was the ""end-of-the-line"" for the current and so technically it was the return path.  The old motor was so old that the return line was colored black, as thats how things were done back then, apparently.

After flipping the breaker back on, I turned the breaker off again, when I had the idea to manually spin the fan with my fingers.  Sure enough, it was barely moving, like it was stuck on something.  Aha!  I had mounted the blower fan too far on the driveshaft, and it was getting caught on the housing.  I pulled the whole thing out, adjusted the placement of the blower fan on the driveshaft

Success!!  Crisp, self-satisfied grunts.

Thanks again

For the past few months we've had low voltage (like 83v) at these affected outlets and lights, and ceiling light looking for loose or broken wires. I didn't find any, but anywhere I found wires crimped together, I cut the crimp off, stripped the wires and twisted and capped them. This didn't help the low voltage problem. I replaced every switch and outlet that was affected -- no change. I tested every circuit in the fuse panel inside the house, and there were I believe 2 circuits in the house that were affected with the low voltage. I even took as much of it apart as I could and cleaned all the contacts with sandpaper -- no change. I even opened up that other small box outside where it goes into the wall. There were wires twisted together but it looked kinda ratty so I unhooked it all, cleaned everything, until tonight.

Apparently the GFI outlet in the bathroom quit working right and was putting a load on the circuit (broken test button), but we don't use this bathroom for anything at all, I'm not worried about it not being GFI for the time being). That fixed that problem, but now I have an even bigger problem. I have no idea how this came to be.

When that breaker is turned ON, but everything else in the house is fine. When the breaker is OFF, everything I was previously having a problem with works fine (107-109v at the outlets), BUT then my cooktop/fridge/other stuff doesn't work at all. It doesn't make any sense at all.  I checked the fuse panel in the house and there's no blown fuses or loose wires or anything.

Is it possible that the wires in that box going into the wall are backwards? I only uncapped one pair at a time specifically so I wouldn't mix them up. What would happen if I reversed them? 

Here's a drawing of the house and the affected outlets and stuff:

[http://i.imgur.com/2a18w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2a18w.jpg)

the green marks are good working lights and outlets

I can take pictures if it'd help at all.

FINAL UPDATE -- Duke Power came out and I explained the problem to the guy. He tested the incoming power at the main breaker, and everything works great now. No dim lights or low voltages anywhere anymore.  Thanks everyone for their help and suggestions!

1375674089.0,1jpwo2,"Smelly basement / random ""water"" spots",WombatTaco,10,1,12,"Got a question about our basement.  I think this is the subreddit I need to be in. 

We've got a finished basement with laminate floors, because the spots REEK of this urine like smell...but after further investigation, I can't really say it is. Most telling ones: UNDER my elliptical and under the couch against the wall (3in space... my cats are big so they wouldn't be able to fit under there even if they tried).  There are also wet ""streaks"" down these paper curtains the previous owners had installed.  All of the spots have been near the walls themselves and not in the center of the room.  No leaky spots from the ceilings.  I've never seen the walls be damp, but then again I've never stared at them and they don't have water streaks like the paper curtains.

In any case, the smell is back (and no wet spots). It's actually worse and doesn't go away even after cleaning. Thought it was my kitty litter, but that gets cleaned daily anyway and doesn't smell like that at all.

One of the worst wet spots had made the laminate floor pop up a lil near the edges.  Seemed some of the smell got worse getting near the sump pump. Started thinking it was that

The previous owners had finished the basement on their own.  There is a piece of plastic like thing between the laminate and the concrete floor (guessing it was -- according to google searching -- maybe like a polyethylene membrane?). We've also got interior french drains. We've got an outdoor drain from/for the sump pump. 

Right outside our basement, that hasn't really been an issue. 

So I'm thinking it's probably mildew or mold growing... Could it  have been caused by rain/bad runoff that got inside the basement (thru the sump pump drain?)  How do I check for this? How do I get rid of that mildew? Do we have to tear up the floors and walls? 

Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thanks.

EDIT: we bought a black light to check around the area to make sure it wasn't the cats. Sadly cat waste (hairball

UPDATE:

I revieved this e-mail from Antiquephono early this morning.
 
""It's very difficult to diagnose a problem without actually seeing the machine.  Your youtube video clearly demonstrates the problem but unfortunately can provide no clues as to the solution.  In the video you mentioned that you had the ""needle"" (actually called a stylus in these types of machines) replaced.  Although the stylus has nothing to do with your current problem

Failing that

1) Belt: This should be leather; not too tight but not too loose.  A rubber band will often cause the problem you have.  There is also an idler wheel below the bedplate that applies pressure to the belt.  This should be freely rotating.

2) Half-nut &amp; spring:  At the rear of the carriage (the part that holds the reproducer) is a flat metal bar (called the half nut spring) with a threaded half-nut attached. This must be adjusted so that the half nut engages the feedscrew but without too much pressure on the half nut spring.  One your model

3) Mainspring: You should be able to wind the crank 30-35 rotations from a relaxed mainspring.  The machine will not play properly without enough tension on the mainspring - that is

*(already tried cranking it to no avail)

4) Lubrication: This is self-explanatory.  All points of movement need a small drop of quality oil (sewing machine oil is best).  If the mainspring ""thumps"" while running, cleaned, lubricated, and reassembled, but this is a job for the experienced.

*(no thumping noise from what i can tell)

I note that your machine is equipped with a 4-Minute Attachment.  Originally, or toward the right side of your machine.  This suggests, of course, that your record must be a 2 minute as well.  The cover to your 4-Minute Attachment can be readily removed by loosening one of the screws on the side.  Making sure these gears are clean and properly lubricated will help ensure good performance from your machine.""",,False,self,1366989615.0,t3_1d4lh1

I used a current tester and all three sockets light up with 120V. so i tried inserting a new bulb (only one), no voltage (or at least less than 80volts since my tester wouldn't detect anything less than that, or so it claims)

Any idea how to tackle this issue?  

Extra info: 

The fixture itself has three wire pairs (one from each socket) all consolidated into one (through twist-on wire connectors). the resulting wire pair is then connected to the wires hanging out of the ceiling ""box""(?) with twist-on connectors as well.

My issue is with the freezer. There is water leaking from the top of the freezer inside down into the freezer where the food is. It is a little drip that then freezes. After a couple hours and days it looks like lava of ice (oxymoron?) settling from where the water is dripping to the bottom inside of the freezer where the food is.

I did some research and GE and other forums says it is a clogged drain tube. Well I unplugged the whole unit and let it ""thaw"" out and used a hair dryer to warm up the tube and let it sit for a couple more hours. I did not disconnect the drain tube because I did not want to break anything.

1348265479.0,109rjn,Exterior window re-caulking advice,bkedelen,8,1,7,"I just finished re-caulking my bay window in the exterior side.  I selected white OSI Quad as my replacement material since I knew it was an industry standard and would have no problem adhering to the substrates in question, so I decided to work on the rest of my windward windows.  I have 5 more to restore

* I have a septic system and was pretty concerned about cleaning my equipment after the job

* I tried to tape the brick before applying the OSI but a fair amount of overdraw happened behind the tape.  Furthermore the product became tacky so quickly that removing the tape messed the job up pretty good and I had to touch some areas up without tape, already a fool's errand, but if there is something easy I would appreciate knowing about it.

* After removing the old caulk there were some pretty significant gaps around my windows, particularly the non-expanding door-and-window stuff, so I try to avoid it unless my caulk cracks in front of an opening.  What is the right way to resolve this kind of issue?

* Should I use clear OSI Quad to caulk the mortar between and around my angled brick sills?  They are angled down a bit and I live in an area with low humidity and which doesn't get much rain.  Snow never sits on the sills either.  The bricks and mortar on my sills still looks great after 50 years

* Finally I am wondering if I should consider using a different product that cleans up more easily and/or shrinks less.  Some of the newest products seem attractive but I worry about how well they will hold up to the test of time.  It is easy to find anecdotes about every product on the market which say either that the product holds up great or that it fails in a couple of years.  OSI Quad is kind of a battleship in this regard but I would hate to miss out on something much better just because I didn't ask.  OSI Advantage seems to have been pulled off the market at some point and people seem to be backing away from recommending DAP Sidewinder lately

Thanks for putting up with my wall of text.  Any suggestions are much appreciated.",self,t5_2rf27,1348265894.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/109rjn/exterior_window_recaulking_advice/

I unscrewed the back panel and took a look at where the cord is screwed into the terminals

So what should I do now? I can take more pictures if it helps.

I just got done talking with someone from a very helpful repair company that walked me though some troubleshooting tips.

The following trips the breaker:

* Right terminal unplugged
* Left terminal unplugged

The following DOES NOT trip the breaker:

* Left and right terminals unplugged

* All terminals plugged in

1326645043.0,oi2av,Furnace help - diagnostic lights and manual inside. Do I call a pro or is this fixable myself? Help please!,BridgfordJerky,9,3,13,"Good morning!

I noticed that my heater seemed to be struggling to match the thermostat setting lately ([I'd set it at 73 and it'd hover around 71

There are [2 LED lights inside the panel that I assume are diagnostic lights. One is flashing](http://i.imgur.com/GvThbh.jpg). Here are the details:

The furnace is a [Lennox G60UHV(X) Series](http://i.imgur.com/UNeCGh.jpg).  I have a copy of the manual which has the full name on it

There's [a sticker on the front panel of the furnace that shows a big list of diagnostic codes](http://i.imgur.com/T0MDih.jpg) relating to the flashing lights.

The left light stays off and the right light is flashing pretty quickly

If that's the case

* the pressure switch is open; or
* there's a blocked inlet/exhaust vent; or
* the condensate line is blocked (for condensing furnaces only); or
* the pressure switch closed prior to activation of combustion air inducer.


I don't know what any of these things mean. If anyone can give some pointers I'd really appreciate it.

Is this something I can fix

The house does stay warm enough that this isn't a big problem yet. That light may have been flashing for a few weeks for all I know and I only recently noticed it.

Any help is appreciated

The screw actually screws into a small metal nut that has been pressed into a plastic ""well"" on the other half of the plastic casing - the walls of this well have cracked away.  I have the metal nut.

I was thinking of doing this:

* Insert the screw into its hole and gently tighten the nut on it on the other side.
* Lay down a blob of some kind of ""liquid plastic"" on the opposing side of the casing.
* Press them together and let the ""liquid plastic"" harden around the nut.
* Pray I can back out the screw from the nut when everything is dried.

Does this sound feasible?

Any suggestions for a ""liquid plastic"" (or whatever) to use for this process?

Any alternative suggestions?

Is there another more appropriate place for this question?

1373381116.0,1hxqk9,Mold / Plumbing Fix,murtasma,9,1,7,"Hello I just bought a house and it looks like we have some mold / sewer gas problems under the kitchen sink. I suspect it's mold under the cabinets. I think there is a leak somewhere under the cabinet in the drain line. When I had the inspection done the inspector made not that there must have been a leak under the sink at one time because of the damage done to the the inside bottom of the cabinets.

In the pictures I've shared below you can clearly see how the baseboard is all warped. When the inspection was done there was no musty smell but after a few days of using the sink the smell started. I suspect the drain line is leaning somewhere under the baseboard. My guess would be that joint just above the baseboard. In picture 2 you can clearly see how this joint extends below the trim piece where the board used to be attached to. My guess is this was the repair that was done. Why exactly is there that Y fitting there instead of just a straight pipe?

Does the plumping job here seem correct? I see a mix of plastic shut offs and metal shut offs. I plan on replacing all the plastic shut off's with metal once since the plastic ones are prone to leaking. In picture 1 why is there a plastic shut off there however you can see that line makes a 90 degree turn to another line that has another shut off higher. Why is it done like this? To me this kind of looks like a shit plumbing job. How does the drain trap look to you? To me it looks like it would be difficult for water to actually wash through however I haven't noticed draining problems yet but I haven't really used the sink all that much because of the smell and the fact that we still have tons of unpacking to do.

My plan is to cut a small 2in circle hole in the baseboard in a few areas using something like this http://www.professional-power-tool-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/drill-bits-hole-saw-275x300.jpg to inspect the inside of the baseboard for mold as well as under the baseboard. I'll be cutting away the whole baseboard and replacing it eventually but I want to get an idea of what's going on down there using a flash light and mirror before I rip it all out.

1366826738.0,1d0vnx,Sewer Gas in Condo (X-Post from HomeImprovement),toothfart,8,2,3,"First off

We recently moved into a condo. The unit is on the top floor, with no problems.

However, I thought there may be a dead animal in the walls, or worse- a dead body in the unit below. The smell was brutal.

After some poking around, but it's been unoccupied for over a year. I figured the water in the traps evaporated- and perhaps adding water somehow made it smelly. I tried all the standard DIY fixes: bleach, vinegar, baking soda, hot water, etc (in no particular order). Nothing. Still awful.

Long story short

1. High altitude in a windy area
2. Crack in the a pipe
3. P-traps are done wrong
4. Toilet is loose. If the wax ring isn't creating a good seal
5. Dead animal in the walls

Turns out, and there was definitely a strong current of stink-air coming from that spot. The plumber did his thing, and on the way out said ""Sewer gas fixes are usually a 3 visit minimum. Usually never a first time fix.""

That was yesterday.

There is definitely an improvement- but, it still stinks in each cabinet under every sink.

I'm hoping the problem is in fact fixed

I felt sick all that day- hopefully it's just psychological.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Office chair: The plastic collar that holds one of five wheels in place has broken!  In the image

Consequences: Wheel falls out during rolling maneuvers

Structural materials: Inner and outer walls of wheel hub: plastic.  Wheel pin: metal.

Measures taken: 
1) Attached a block of foam in place of the wheel to slide across the floor; friction across broad surface area quickly caused lateral failure.

2) Inserted a metal plug in place of the failed inner wall; quickly failed due to incorrect shape and insufficient reinforcement.

3) Built up a replacement inner wall with layers of epoxy [remnants visible in photo]; terrible idea

1342403855.0,wmd9m,Help unscrewing an old rusted pipe plug on my bathtub water pipes?,BridgfordJerky,6,1,15,"Hi all.

My bathtub is draining really slowly so I think I've either got a hair clump or possibly a small toy stuck in the drain. The bathtub drains almost straight down through the basement to the main leading to the sewer.

My problem is that the square plug on the water pipe is super old and rusted and I'm having a hell of a time getting it loose.

Here are some pictures. The stuff dripping from the cap is Liquid Wrench. You'll notice from the pics that this thing is also in an awkward position. I'm using a wrench to get around the square cap and then using a hammer to nail the wrench

[Here's a link to the imgur album of pics.](http://imgur.com/a/toM5k)


Does anyone have any recommendations as to how to get this thing loose? So far I've been applying the Liquid Wrench pretty liberally every half hour or so

I also took my hammer and hit the square part of the plug relatively lightly for a minute or so

I also have WD-40 but I figured the Liquid Wrench would be better. Any ideas? I'm a new first-time homeowner so I'm relatively limited on tools and know-how but I'll go get a tool if that's what it takes.

Thanks!

**UPDATE** - My brother and I were actually able to get it off the night before last with Liquid Wrench

I think what helped is that I took the tip of a dart and ""carved"" a bunch of gunk out along the threading of the plug and then reapplied the liquid wrench. I did that twice.

After that my brother applied pressure while I used the mallet and it came loose.

I got a big hunk of something out of there (either a clump of 50 years worth of hair or maybe it was toilet paper or a paper towel with hair around it) and got the cap back on. Now it drains perfectly.

Thanks to all for your posts and suggestions!

My question is: Are there two coolant temperature sensors? Is there a fan switch i'm not aware of? Where is the wiring from the computer to the fuse box routed? Could that small tear in the wire leave too little voltage for the relays to kick over?
