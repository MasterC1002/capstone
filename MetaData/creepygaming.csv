1351037742.0,11z74n,Something just happened in Halo 1. Would like advice on what to do next.,Distioned,219,24,42,"Hey

I recently built a new pc. It wasn’t exactly powerful, I popped in my Halo CE into the disc tray and installed it. I have some fond memories playing with my group of friends and wanted to relive a bit of my past.

I instantly started to have problems installing it. Aside from all of the minor compatibility issues this game has with windows 7, so I just booted up another game, slightly frustrated that I wasted about an hour of my life on that thing.

It didn’t take long for me to start looking for workarounds so I could play.. I eventually found a keygen, and hopped into the multiplayer lobby. I just picked a random game of CTF, and joined to see if everything worked. It didn’t. A pop up appeared and said the server’s client needed to be updated. the error messages got weirder and weirder.  I should have taken a screenshot of some of them. Some of them were almost laughable. Random selections of words would replace the error messages. Completely random.
 
It seemed no one else online had this problem. The ones that did were told to try updating their game. This information was no use to me because I updated when I first booted it up.

 However

Now some of you guys that have played Halo extensively know that there are certain points on any given map you can glitch up to so people can’t find you. These points require that you utilize glitches like pushing yourself through a wall with a vehicle. But there was always one I couldn’t get to. It took such crucial mouse movements and careful precision to even make it to the first step. Since I had nothing better to do in an empty server

So I got myself into a ghost, you’ll just be knocked off to the side. If you do it too quickly, you will just plain knock yourself through the wall, into the abyss. Getting in between there is where I’m trying to get. A few tries later, and I’m in. that was the easy part. The next few parts are hard to explain in text. I had to kinda shimmy across the wall until I start to get pushed off by something invisible. I now have to jump on that invisible thing without sliding off. It’s cake from there. a few tries later, and I had it. The vantage point this glitch had on the center of the map made it rightfully so for it to be the hardest to achieve.

My victory was cut short when my spartan drops dead. What the crap. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. Maybe I was out of bounds for too long? I couldn’t think about this for too long until I started dying randomly even more. I started to get creeped out. The text just said “Distioned died” I’ve never seen a pop up like this in Halo before.

I went down into my base just to make sure nothing was hitting me. I sat there for what seemed like minutes. I was observing everything. I leaned forward so my face was almost touching the monitor. my screen went blank for a second. I didn’t have any time to notice what was going on when I heard this horrible screeching noise. I reacted by knocking my headphones onto the keyboard. Everything was dark. Dark to the point where I could barely make out anything. Then a player joined.

The player who just joined my seemingly impossible to join server

The outward appearance of the blue base seemed normal, But I was stopped in my tracks when a text appeared on my screen. I nearly forgot you could chat in this game. 
juliet: =]
Distioned: who are you?
juliet: lets play hide and seek =]

 After I dropped dead once again

Anyway

If you guys have any advice for what to do next I’d appreciate it. I’m off to bed for now.

I look down from where he once stood and see his body lying in the street overrun with infected......

No where else in the game does this happen. Just right in this one spot that I happened to come across. This person has no meaning to the story what so ever and right now im still contemplating as to why the developers would want to put something like that in there.

Anyway

Well I was happily playing through the opening section with no troubles, the one where you have to build the cloth bridge by freeing the little cloth guys?

I was bobbing around here and I saw another guy in the distance. Now for those of you who haven't played this online

The guy wasn't really moving, so I assumed he must know his way around and wouldn't really care if I did what I want.

Anyway, he was just there. I'm not sure if his scarf was long enough to just kinda jump, and I would have assumed that if it didn't continue down this weird path.

I literally NEVER saw him walk or jump, just looking at me. This carried on for ages. A couple of times I'd refuse to look away and walk up to him, but when I did, he wouldn't move, he'd just stay there.

I did notice something pretty glitchy about him though, still, weirder things have happened, that was until I did the big slide level.

Obviously he didn't walk or jump so you can safely assume he didn't slide. Up until this point I figured that he could just be moving really fast when I look away

As I slid down, just watching as I went past. The bit that made me jump the most is the part where you're sliding past the pillars (there's a clip of it in the review) where he popped up between two of the pillars.

So I was freaked, so I carried on to the underground part with the big flying rock snake thing where he was stood, right in the middle of the room as the snake scanned around.

It was weird, but the searchlight didn't pick him up at all, they went over him but it was like he wasn't there, so I soldiered on and got past the snake and noticed he wasn't around again, but I was skeptical, and rightly so, after the last time he had 'left'.

So on the bit where you slide down away from the monsters and they get blasted by light? Well I saw where the light came from this time. He was waiting for me at the bottom of the slope as I slid down

So yeah, the PS3 wasn't responding to the controller, and I was a little more freaked than I should have been getting closer to the TV to switch it off with the guy there.

Anyway, so I went downstairs to reboot the router. The internet went down, cutting the guy off so it crashed, makes sense, kind of anyway, except for the fact my housemate told me; ""No use, the internet's been fucked for the last 2, I've been trying to play Fifa"".

What the fuck. I wasn't even online.

Well this morning the internet IS working (obviously) and I can't bring myself to look at the PS3 because that is FUCKED UP.

So please tell me this is some glitch or explain it.


*UPDATE*

Ok

What the actual fuck.


*UPDATE*

So I managed to get on and he was there again. My game is sat paused as I try to upload 3 pictures I got. They were all corrupted but I managed to get this one after a few hours of fucking about. I imagine the other two will work this way too.

Sorry for the shitty images, but I figured you would want actual photographs with timestamps.

It’s been a long time so I don’t fully remember the original game, so the sky is always black. Nearly all the text is glitched. The textures on character faces are OK until they change their expression (such as when Zelda smiles) which causes their face sprites to go crazy.

A lot of the characters are missing. The ones left don’t have idle animations

Many of the songs are useless. Epona’s song just causes the horse to ride straight pass me into the horizon. Teleport songs trap you various places. The Sun Song simply freezes the game.
In addition to all the minor glitches which make progress through every dungeon room take at least an hour

First is Gohma’s eye. They are no longer confined to the Deku Tree boss room. They randomly show up in every area I’ve looked in. This makes using first person (for hookshot/bow/etc) extremely risky. If you look at an eye in first-person you are teleported back to Gohma’s room, which is followed by the game crashing. This can happen sometimes by simply allowing an eye to reach the middle of the screen even when using the third person camera. I’ve learnt to avoid this by regularly using the Z button to center the camera away from any eyes. But there is always a small chance of getting unlucky during a cutscene.

Second problem is that wallmasters tend to appear in random places. You can’t stand still for long anywhere. Getting caught means being dropped back into Link’s house, before the scream sound played. These days I usually hang out at Link’s house for a while before turning off the N64, it’s a nice moment to reflect on your mistakes even if there is no escaping. Knowing that the game is over can be quite comforting. You can only stay there for about 20 minutes because multiple wallmasters appear in the house eventually, this causes a lot screaming inside the house, which bothers me even as an adult. So I still use a timer to make sure I turn it off after 19 minutes.

For those interested, next to the same furniture my dad broke as a kid. I give it a go at least once a week.

Anyone else experience a glitched cartridge?

1338166306.0,u7zs3,A weird creepy moment I had with Red Dead Redemption yesterday.,jimothyjim,120,16,28,"Disclaimer: This isn't ""scare your pants off"" creepy but it was a bit
unnerving at the time. I'm also a bit of a rambler when it comes to
writing so it might be a bit lengthy.

I'm not that far into the game yet
Thieves Landing and it's here where things became a bit strange. I'd
just done a stranger mission (not a particularly important one but
I'll avoid spoiler details anyway) and I was pretty tired in real life
so I decided it was time to save and call it a night.

I got on my horse
knocked some randomner off his feet. Unfortunately this is a frequent
occurrence for me so I knew he was gonna start shooting at me once he
got back up. I don't like to kill civilians because it kills the
immersion for me
he'd hopefully calm down and I wouldn't have to kill him just to save
my game. I rode just far enough for the buildings to exit my view
then turned right around and headed back for the room. It must have
been about 11pm or 12am game-time at this point so it was obviously
pretty dark. As I re-entered the area I found it surprisingly easy to
weave my way trough the people and reach the target building
didn't think too much of it at the time.

Following my dismount of the horse
completely motionless in the middle of the bridge at the edge of the
area. I thought I must have missed her saying something important
that she was just waiting for me to come on over so a random mission
could start. Believing in my theory I walked right up to her and she
doesn't move
dialogue that they all say but it' was completely non specific and
it's definitely not an errand she wanted to be ran. ""What's up with
this?"" I thought
directly into her
that she'd get knocked out of this weird lock and her AI would take
control

The momentum of the push meant I was now directly behind her so I
turned around to face back towards her. She hadn't even turned around
she was just stood motionless in the new sport I'd knocked her into
staring blankly into the distance. Now facing directly back into the
residential area
town was stood completely motionless. They were all saying generic NPC
stuff
to be doing the normal wall lean animations or anything
just motionlessly staring in random directions. Two particularly odd
guys were sitting on horses to the side of the bridge
water and in an area of plants. I don't know why they were there. I've
never seen an NPC riding a horse off of the normal track
seriously doubt they'd gained entry via the river with the bridge
literally right beside them.

I stood there looking at them for about 30 seconds
town run through it's dialogue
just an inch. They didn't. I knew it was just a game glitch or
whatever
living dead town. I really was pretty tired in real life though
shook it off and started walking back towards the purchasable property
to save. Just as I rounded the side of that house
walking behind me. Naturally I turned around thinking ""oh good
everyone's back to normal""
heading back towards him and as I did so he turned around and started
walking away
think he was.

I wish this story had a better punchline
his head started flashing on my screen shouting ""All hail Satan!!"" but
unfortunately what really happened is I bought the property and went
to sleep both in-game and in real life. It was
surreal scene that I thought you might enjoy hearing about
haven't actually played since then so who knows? Maybe next time I'll
start the game and he'll be looking over my bed as I load it up
the town members lifelessly staring over his shoulder. Probably not
though.",self,t5_2tv55,1338219056.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/u7zs3/a_weird_creepy_moment_i_had_with_red_dead/

1361475176.0,18yz4g,A creepy experience I had when making a Doom2 level,fruitcakefriday,93,11,15,"*Foreword* This is quite a personal experience as it is part of my history as a level designer. It's kinda lengthy

Back in 1995 I was entering my teen years and harbouring an (un)healthy addiction to Doom and the DEU editing kit. I loved making levels for multiplayer to play with my friends

There was one SP level I made (which made its way onto a PC Gamer UK cover CD I'm happy to say) where I really wanted to push the ambience of the game and offer something a bit fresh in the Doom engine.

I was making a small outdoor map set in the early hours of the morning; low light level, quiet lonely winds, rustling leaves. However, the Doom engine didn't support anything of the sort...so I improvised. 

I took 3 or 4 of the enemy types in the game and changed their idle sounds - which play everywhere - to the ambient effects I wanted. Then I used the Doom2 Boss to spawn them into a room the player never got into, thus mixing up the frequency of the different ambient sounds. It worked very well; the monsters would spawn, hoot and rustle a bit, then die a few moments later. The only hint that there was anything odd going on in the level was the demonic chant the Boss says when it 'sees' you, which I left in because it sounded cool and gave a good opening to the level. Other than that I had an OK single player level with some novel ambient sound effects; very rare for a Doom2 level!

There was however another odd thing that happened, and this thing is one of the most chilling experiences I've had in a video game.

I was testing some new lighting levels in the map, imps, cacodemons and pinkys. This was to be the first map of many, so I kept my monsters small, and some were in use by the ambient sound system. I fought my way into the graveyard in the centre of this sparse forest, and climbed the marble steps at the end to the great tomb and got the next key to the exit door, and triumphed against the hoards of super-fast pinkys that emerged from a room at the back of the glade upon picking up the key and rocket launcher.

It was tough; in Nightmare mode enemies are twice as fast, when I started to hear the distant servo legs of the Arachnotron - one of my ambient sound monsters - faintly on the edge of hearing, but getting closer. These things are spawned miles away in my closed-off room, yet I was hearing one approach. Fear gripped me. This was Wrong. I made the level and I knew exactly the inner workings of it - there was no possible way for the monsters in my ambient room to escape and get into the play space...yet I was clearly hearing the mechanical whir of legs twitching movement, now followed by another, from a different direction. I was terrified. I tentatively continued on my path to the exit, but no sooner had I reached the pass with the gate previously opened that a Revenant - my hooting owl - *walked out from the wall ahead* and ambled toward me in the grey light. Oh fuck.

Having reached its prey through an impossible escape from my ambient room, and now fired its homing missiles in my direction. The Arachnotron's leg sounds were now deafening, and as I ran back into the trees from the skeleton's missile, two of these mechanical brain-spiders entered through the walls from different directions...I was being hunted! By my ambient sound monsters! At this point I had worked on the level for so long, I had almost forgotten they existed, and took them for granted, but now they had found a way to settle the score after being locked in that room and crushed over and over again.

So after recovering from my initial shock, and at this point pushed into the back of my level in the farthest point from the exit, and these hellish hooting wind monsters continued to appear through the walls; there must have been 4 revenants, 6 arachnatrons, and an arch-vile stalking in the distance...I honestly felt like crying, this was so wrong.

I didn't make it to the exit. I died, as I had no control over the monster types spawned by the Boss. The crusher I had made also served another function; to kill the weaker enemies quickly so their unchanged idle grunts could not be heard, leaving only the stronger enemies with their modified sounds. They didn't appear in my level at first, but before I died Imps, Cacodemons and Mancubi were emerging through the walls, and not even being bothered by walls *inside* the level. It was hell.

I still don't know the details of this 'bug', doomed to squeal and die in my kill-room, that had found a way to break free, and come after me to my grave.

[edit] I am writing this from memory, and took some creative license in my story, but the meat of the story is 100% true as well as my reactions. The level still exists wherever that PC Gamer CD does, along with a bunch of my other levels.",,False,self,1361476813.0,t3_18yz4g

Yet, people met face-to-face to conduct software swap parties, trading games and applications on Sharpie-labeled five-and-a-quarter inch floppies. 

Of course, a few early programming talents designed their own computer games to share amongst their circle of acquaintances, who in turn would pass it on, until, if fun and well-designed enough, an independently-developed game had its place in the collection of aficionados across the country. Think of it as the 80's equivalent of a viral video. 

Pale Luna, all computers that have ever run the game now detritus buried under layers of filth and polystyrene. This fact is attributed to a number of rather abstruse design choices made by its programmer. 

Pale Luna was a text adventure in the vein of Zork and The Lurking Horror, except for the text: 

-You are in a dark room. Moonlight shines through the window. 

-There is GOLD in the corner

-There is a DOOR to the EAST. 

-Command? 

So began the game that one writer for a long-out-of-print fanzine decried as ""enigmatic, PICK UP SHOVEL, PICK UP ROPE, OPEN DOOR, and GO EAST, the player was soon presented with the following: 

-Reap your reward. 

-PALE LUNA SMILES AT YOU. 

-You are in a forest.There are paths to the NORTH

-Command? 

What quickly infuriated the few who've played the game was the confusing and buggy nature of the second screen onward — only one of the directional decisions would be the correct one. For example, requiring the operator to hard reboot the entire computer. 

Further, the standard text adventure commands appeared to be useless: The only accepted non-movement-related prompts were USE GOLD, which caused the game to display the message: 

-Not here. 

USE SHOVEL

-Not now. 

And USE ROPE

-You've already used this. 

Most who played the game progressed a couple of screens into it before becoming fed-up by having to constantly reboot and tossing the disk in disgust, no matter the era: some people who use them have way too much time on their hands. 

A young man by the name of Michael Nevins decided to see if there was more to Pale Luna than what met the eye. Five hours and thirty-three screens worth of trial-and-error and unplugged computer cords later

-PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE 

-There are no paths 

-PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE 

-The ground is soft 

-PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE 

-Here 

-Command? 

It was another hour still before Nevins stumbled upon the proper combination of phrases to make the game progress any further; DIG HOLE

-Congratulations 

—— 40.24248 —— 

—— -121.4434 —— 

Upon which the game ceased to accept commands

After some deliberation

The next day, and a shovel, he navigated the park's trails, noting with amusement how each turn he made corresponded roughly to those that he took in-game. Though he initially regretted bringing the cumbersome digging tool on a mere hunch, the path's similarity all but confirmed his suspicions that the journey would end with him face-to-face with an eccentric's buried treasure. 

Out of breath after a tricky struggle to the coordinates

Nevins promptly reported the situation to the authorities. The girl was identified as Karen Paulsen

Efforts were made to track down the programmer of Pale Luna

Collectors have been known to offer upwards of six figures for an authentic copy of the game. 

The rest of Karen's body was never found

Hey guys, it was awesome. I jumped into a lake.


So the gist of my plan is to play hide and seek with her and see where this takes me. I honestly don’t know how I didn’t make the connection between “find me” and her saying “lets play hide and seek”. But here’s the problem. This was probably just some one time thing. A random occurrence. Although I’m giving myself the benefit of the doubt

And with all that out of the way, should we pack it up early? I don’t want to keep you from performing an exorcism on your game disc”

I’m going to play again as soon as possible. So expect another update tomorrow. I think I’m going to split my updates into different threads so I don’t risk hitting the character limit. But I also don’t want to be spamming your board. So what do you guys think? Paste ‘em all together or split em up?

UPDATE:

I didn’t sleep last night.  I was too excited to play. No

Well I did just that. I started up Halo and created a LAN server instead of an internet server. This time I’d know if some weird crap was really going on. I hit start server and the map started to load up. Well the first thing I noticed was I could actually see again. Everything looked normal enough. This wasn’t nearly as scary as I remember it being. 

I decided to give myself a 10 minute time limit to wait before I tried switching it to an internet game or just calling it a night. All I could do was fill the time by aimlessly wandering around bloodgulch. This obviously got boring after 3 - 4 minutes. I started calling out to her.

Distioned: hey juliet? getting tired here..

Distioned: What am I supposed to do?

That seemed to do it. juliet joined. A strange mixture of fear and confusion came over me because I thought I had everything figured out. I thought that she was just a random player who was screwing with me. But now

juliet: do you want to play now?

Distioned: Yeah

My game froze and everything went dark again. But this time There was a noise. It was just looping over and over again.. I started to look around for her

juliet: Count to 10.

So I counted to ten. I was just going to search from the back of the map to the front. That seems like the most efficient way to go about this. I eventually found her crouched in a corner looking at me.

juliet: You found me.

I didn’t know whether or not she was just going to leave after I found her so I immediately asked her

Distioned: Who exactly are you?

juliet: That’s not the question you should be asking.

Distioned: Then what should I be?

juliet: You should be looking for a place to hide.

And with that, and I’ve kinda gotten bored of this. If you guys have anymore suggestions, I’ll be open for them.

I find jump scares as a cheap tactic in most horror stuff

Personally I really liked Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth. The game really had a disturbing and unsettling atmosphere to it, or coming across a crime scene of mutilated bodies. The scene where you have to run for your life had my heart racing (Silent Hill: Shattered Memories reminded me of this scene). 

Games with no combat like Amnesia or Silent Hill: Shattered Memories really help put that fear of the unknown into the player and had a scary atmosphere too.

I do not find games like Slender scary because it is all just fear of the jump scare of not fear of the Slenderman himself (at least that's how I feel about it).

So what are your picks for scariest games that don't use cheap tactics?",self,t5_2tv55,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/1ar3m4/what_are_some_good_horror_games_with_minimal_jump/

1356734402.0,15lfql,Creepy driving simulator glitch.,Winter_S,79,19,7,"I while back (about 6 years) this nearby country club did an annual ""Car Festival"". It wasnt anything special

Each year

One year an insurance company was sponsoring the club. This company had a Driving Test Simulator that people could use to see how good they are at driving.

It was a bit of fun

This simulator had **very** basic graphics. The 3D graphics were composed of a small amount of polygons

I decided I would give it a go


I sat down in the chair

Before I say what happens

* A grey road that goes round in a *complicated* route.
* Various bridges that your could drive over
* Hills/Mountains in the background (These were part of the map
* A River surrounding the map (I assumed you drive into it and the game says ""you have crashed."" 


The game started (in third person) with me in my car, or just had a very limited machine to run on.

The game didn't even have sound.

I drove around the map

I got to a a bridge on the map

I made a sharp right

I noticed the wheels on my car were starting to jump between the ground and the car itself

I floored it and the car itself didn't go any faster

The cars model then started to morph shape

I notice I was driving towards the river that surrounded the map

I drive/fly over the bridge and suddenly the game emits a white noise/squealing noise

All of a sudden my character floats above the car itself (car continues) and starts to spin around. This goes on for a few seconds

The model stops spinning with the character at an angle

All I see is the head of the character on the screen when the beeping suddenly increases in volume

Now I'm back at the beginning. But in the background is a car in the air

All of a sudden there is a beep

All the time I was freaked out.

Last night at around midnight, an old Korean horror game made in 2001 which has been translated into English. The main character wanted to place a gift on his crush's desk for Valentine's Day at night when not many students were at the school. My brother and I enjoyed the players's commentary and his style, so we continued to watch him play.

Some time into the game, and the other schoolkids enjoyed her misery. She became more anxious about her math abilities as time went on until one day she suffered a heart attack and collapsed to the floor. The note ended with, ""...I feel that she is still there sometimes, trying to solve the maths problem.""

The player laughed as he read the last line, and attacked him. He screamed and ran out of the room and down the hallway while cursing and catching his breath. As he ran down the hallway, the video suddenly froze and the entire screen was covered by a random checkerboard mixture of pixelated squares while the TV made loud erratic sounds. 

My brother and I stared at the screen, my laptop shuts off and the TV goes completely black. We laid in our beds motionless for a few moments. 

I turned my laptop back on, then we continued to watch a couple more videos. Soon, my brother fell fast asleep, and I stayed awake roaming the internet.

Some time later, slowly closing my eyes. 

Just then, and the disc tray closed. I sat up. Ping. Open. Ping. Close. Ping ping ping. Pingpingpingpingpingpingpingping. Open close open close open close. 

I jumped out of my bed, immediately stopping the pinging sounds. The glowing light from the Xbox's power gradually faded away, and the room fell back into darkness. I stood there for a bit.

1364507269.0,1b7bjf,Minecraft Stalker (x-post from /r/nosleep),proudcatowner,65,18,6,"(not written by me)

I love playing Minecraft. I don’t join servers to play the RPGs, and this means building satellite houses far away from my own to expand my search radius.

The second house I built is in a mountainous region covered in depressing bluish grass. One day I started killing a few cows for food in preparation for a trek back to my primary home. After I gathered the cow hide and raw beef, but its head followed me wherever I walked for a solid minute. The tree it stood under was right on top of my underground home, and when I went inside I kept hearing the clinking of the skeleton’s bones as it walked around. I didn’t make anything of this until I realized that wherever I walked, the clinking was right over my head. I chalked it up to a glitch.

I returned to my original home for more mining, but the walls just seemed off. The only thing I could think of was that the paintings might have changed around. I rearranged them and made a mental note of which ones I had placed and where they were positioned. Even if they had changed, I thought, it was probably some kind of loading bug.

A few days later, but what happened made me dread going back. When I walked outside, a horde of zombie pigmen were staring at me. I hadn’t hit any of them, so I couldn’t think of a reason for this behavior. I walked around to see what they’d do, and the whole time they just stood in place and stared at me. I walked up to one of them, but as soon as I moved within two blocks it started squealing like it was dying and wouldn’t stop. The whole pack soon followed in squealing at me, so I ran back through the portal.

I made a post about these issues on the Minecraft forums. Most people thought I was making it up, I thought, that someone would go so far out of their way just to screw with a singleplayer save.

After the install, turned my computer off, and went to bed. After a solid night’s rest I woke up wondering if the game would still pull anything weird. I checked the nether, and the zombie pigmen were acting normally. I ran all the way to my house in the hills and panicked at what I saw -- the room was covered floor to ceiling with creeper paintings. Clearly, someone had accessed my game, modified it, and was still manipulating everything. Feeling helpless, “Please stop. You win.” In retrospect

All of the paintings immediately disappeared. I spun around a few times and tried entering text into the chat window, “Please stop. You win.” I tried to run out of the room, but the wooden door had been replaced with an iron version. I tried to craft a switch to open it, but the stick and cobblestone combination produced wheat. I tried other combinations hoping everything was just mismatched, but every single recipe gave me wheat. All of the items in my inventory had been deleted, and my chests were empty. There was no getting out of the cobblestone room.

I stopped trying to break blocks and breathed for a moment. I heard clinking outside the metal door. I walked up to it and found a skeleton peering in. When I punched the door in frustration

I was really freaked out and, checked my internet traffic, or watched me browse. I took the bus to my university and went straight to the computer labs. I checked all of my important accounts, and everything looked normal.

I checked my original thread on the Minecraft forums to see if I had any new replies, more tech-savvy people had experienced and taken care of. I was in the middle of writing the post when a PM showed up in my inbox. It was from a user simply named Skeleton, and all it said was, “i miss you.” I debated sending something back, but instead checked the user’s profile. The account had been created seconds before the message was sent. Undeterred, I continued writing my post asking for help when I received another message. It simply read, “stop, cell number

“What do you want me to do?”

“come back and play”

I hoped that if I indulged him for a while he might get bored and not wreak absolute havoc on my life. I went home as fast as I could and immediately logged into the game. I’m not sure if my home had been rebuilt or if I simply spawned elsewhere, “come.”

I followed the skeleton down an incredibly long hallway with a red cotton path. I got very anxious. The skeleton never broke pace and moved with robotic precision as if it were following a pathing script rather than being controlled by a user. I wondered how such a big cathedral could have been built so fast

After about ten minutes of walking

“Through the door?”

“yes”

“What am I supposed to be doing?”

“youll see”

“Are you going to stop messing with me?”

The skeleton opened up the iron door but didn’t say anything else. Inside I saw a scene as grisly as something can be in Minecraft. The room’s floor was entirely netherrack, and the Enderman screech looped constantly. I looked around the room but didn’t immediately see anything that told me what I was supposed to do. I noticed that the heads were all PCs with custom textures that looked like normal people, and I checked each of them out. Each one had a sign underneath with a name, but none of them sounded familiar. Eventually, I reached a head that was unsettling – it looked like the closest Minecraft could come to rendering my face, and my name was on the sign below. By this point I already felt like the hacker had me by the balls and was hellbent on freaking me out and who knows what else, but this was the first time violence was ever implied. Without any other references or clues, Endermen swarmed through the lava and attacked me. I died instantly and respawned in the same place inside the cathedral. The skeleton was waiting for me there.

“Was that it?”

“hahaha

The skeleton took off in a different direction from where we were last time. After another extremely long journey through the cathedral, which I took. Fire spawned at random and I nearly burned to death a few times, but soon enough I found my render in one of the cages with my name over its head. There was a lever on the side of the cage, and once pulled, the iron door swung open. I realized I had to kill the NPC, and so I swung away with the sword. This time, once I collected my head

Again I spawned at the same point in the cathedral, but there was no point to anything, at least none I could discern. I caught up with the skeleton and said, “Wait, I’m not doing this anymore. What do you want from me?” The skeleton turned around slowly and stared. After about a minute, it walked forward, stopped right in front of me, “play. or else.” Then it posted a long number and asked if it looked familiar. Some of the digits on the end gave me a chill

The skeleton led me to room after room, and then suffer a death as miscellaneous as it was pointless. I would have gotten bored if I wasn’t so stricken with fear for my personal information. This continued till late at night, and I began to fall asleep at the keyboard. When this affected gameplay, the skeleton came up to me, “rest. big play tomorrow.” I was so tired by this point I didn’t even bother to ask when or anything else. I switched the computer off and turned in.

I had trouble sleeping. Several times throughout the night I heard bones clinking outside my door and was too afraid to check what was making the sound. When I woke up the next morning, I kept coming back to determining that I needed to play along for just a bit longer to finally put the craziness to bed.

I logged in and found myself inside the cathedral again, after sundown, the skeleton came back. “been busy. lets play.”

I followed the skeleton again for about an hour. The same exercise was repeated over and over, and below was an enormous pit stacked with heads. There were dozens of them, and it took me a moment to realize they were my own. Without thinking I typed, “What the fuck. This is sick.” The skeleton jumped up and down and ran circles around me. It pasted my bank account number over and over again. Finally, it yelled at me.

“LEAVE.”

I didn’t need to be told twice.

That night, except it was real. I sat helplessly among dozens of heads. I picked one up and looked into its milky eyes. Its lips were parted, and its jaw seemed to move. I thought I could hear breathing, and as I held it up to my ear, it screamed. I woke up immediately.

I decided to log on fifteen minutes before the time I did the day before. Exactly fifteen minutes later, finding my body, collecting my head, and an inescapable death. We did this for an hour, and at the end he showed me how full the pit was getting. I went to bed and had the same nightmare, except there were more heads this time and I swear I heard clinking bones right next to my bed.

This has been going on for two weeks. Every day the pit fills up with more heads, and they’re becoming more and more real and more and more alive. I’ve developed a morning ritual of staring at myself in the mirror, as if to make sure that my head is still on my shoulders. The skeleton was holding a sword last night instead of a bow, and when I thought I heard it inside my room, I felt something sharp and cold against my neck. I don’t care about my personal information anymore, I just want the nightmares to end but I can’t bring myself to stop playing.

I don’t know what to do.

Since I didn't have to download the Wii version, so I couldn't have a general layout for my Sim's life at this moment. After the creation
""Nah Jim, I sent my Sim to go to sleep. It sat down on the bed, and paused. The avatar looked at me, and said it. ""Nah, Jim."" ""He....'s just.. programmed..""


What. The. Fuck.


Pause game Okay. At this point, I wake him up an hour before his work, and put him on Free will mode hoping he'll fill as many motive bars as he can before work, then go to work at the appropriate time. So I thought.
He goes into the vacant backyard, on free will mode. I figured this happened if the meat went bad or something, but this thought was warped after he changed course on his meat dropping. Within a minute, he spelled out the word ""FREEDOM"".
Again
pause game Okay, I saw a thought bubble appear over my Sims head in the background, even though it was paused. It was just another frowny face. A yellow, almost terrifyingly simple frowny face. I unchecked the box, and unpaused. My Sim stood motionless, with the mocking thought bubble still appearing and disappearing. Stupid frowny face.. Honestly folks, this only got worse and more uncomfortable. I mean, but this was ridiculous. I was getting to know this lady in the game
The constant thought bubbles of the frowny face slowed down, full inventory, it began it's 'free will'. first thing that happened, he ran all the way across town, a 2 hour ingame walk to his 'girlfriend's house. It was fascinating to watch. The command bar filling up with the 'Chat' command, followed by the 'Ask to Move in' command. I didn't even think Sims were programmed to love. I laughed in amazement at the sight. The avatar of my Sim looked at me disapprovingly. He motioned toward the girl, and looked at me seriously. Like a best friend in dire straights would.


Sometimes I would be playing loud dubstep while playing the game, would begin dancing ecstatically without any ingame radio playing. It looked and sounded like my Sim tried talking to me ALL the time, too. No one was around but his girlfriend, usually. And both the avatar, and the regular Sim would be looking up at me like a God in the sky.


It was fucking fascinating. I still have the game, and on free will, tends to work out and argue/do negative or mean social options to people. Especially to his girlfriend. Thought bubble changed from Sad to Angry.


**TL;DR: Seemingly self conscious Sim fucks with me hardcore**

UPDATE: i left him alone again for about 5 minutes (which activates free will mode regardless) and he walked (even though the default moving animation is running) to the beach nearby, there was no thought bubble. His avatar was smiling actually, most of the time. I'm going to experiment with the Sim to see if I can get more ... ""conscious"" reactions.


UPDATE 2: My Sim 'acted' normal for a while. I played for about 4 hours, he did something I never saw before, nor thought could be possible.
He fucking called every Sim i met to this point and invited them to a party at my extremely small house with my Sim who has the Loner perk. There was about 30~ Sims that came over? Is this possible with Free Will?

UPDATE 3: So I can't really take a pic with my webcam, nothing really weird has happened. The only thing is when he walks over to the beach after I let it sit. I also noticed this recently, my Sim is seemingly incapable of talking to other Sims face to face. I can chat, use the phone, blah blah blah but no social interactions work face to face.. at least the ones I tried. ",,False,t5_2tv55,True

My most memorable horror moments come from **Silent Hill 3**, I see this game has just been released and think to myself: ""Only a 15+ rating? It can hardly be that scary"" (UK ratings go up to 18+). Boy was I mistaken. Cue 13 year old me guiding Heather through the early shopping mall, feeling the adrenaline pumping each time I have to guide her back and forth by huge towering creatures into bread and book stores, and I'm already creeped out. Then the elevator ride into hell. Darkness, bleeding and rusty walls, howling dogs, noises and cries that may or may not be real, sounds of weeping children, a faceless woman holding a baby doll over a black void, I'd earlier put the gun to my head than be able to go through all that.

For my first horror game experience, the PS2 was in my younger sister's room at the time, and what did she have decorating the bed and walls? DOLLS. Staring through me every time I sat in the dark playing. When one fell off the shelf during playthrough, I thought ""**** that"" and brought my cat into the room every time I dared to play. That cat has seen some shit now. I didn't sleep too well that summer.

Out side of the shop I saw the guy that normally runs over to you, I walked down the main street where all the bodies on the crucifixes were situated. Too my surprise they weren't all there. The bodies remained attached to the crucifixes but their heads had been removed. It was beginning to get uncomfortable. The best way to get rid of it is to leave the area, I thought, the best way to do that is to fast travel so that's what I did, all the way to El Dorado Gas &amp; Service. Once there I entered the building.

Each of the missing heads were placed around the room with a smile on its face and in the centre stood Yes Man. A conversation started. He said things like, ""Ain't gonna escape me! Join the rest of your pals, they've been waiting for ya!"" With that, each head screamed and flew at my character, killing him.

Acegarnish was a typical dwarvern fortress, miasma was becoming an issue, there were always too many cats and not enough booze - especially since water was an issue, as there was no river within the fortress' area. Thankfully some properly dorfy engineering with a stagnant pool, frequent rain, channels and a well had kept them alive.

However

For those of you not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, with most seemingly empty tiles just having soil or gravel or whatever material as their floor listed. Moving into the air results in tiles with (empty space) in their list. These particular tiles literally had *nothing* in them. No list. No (empty space). No labels. Even when you totally exposed them, they would not become any kind of visible tile. Just floating blocks of nothingness.

Well, ever-alpha world of Dorf Fort. He instead figured the original cave-in must have had a cause, so he set his dwarves digging in the area directly under the strangely empty spaces, hoping for a cave, a lake or an underground river or somesuch. So down his dwarves went, picking away through the rock.

And then they [found something](http://i.imgur.com/DDJsy.jpg).

A single tile - or perhaps several

Every dwarf that touches it instantly becomes terribly injured, along with their clothes. All that remains is whatever metal items they were carrying.

Other dwarves greedily rush to pick up their strewn equipment, every limb and organ taking damage simultaneously - and then dying, decaying, and vanishing, all in a matter of seconds.

""Great evil lies in the earth beneath Acegarnish. A malignant and terrible force, walled off that cursed place, and forbade it to all but the most senior members of the hold. Such things must be left undisturbed, lest they be the end of us all.""

I still have the world file for this damnable fortress

Edit: I'm firing up my laptop to copy across the save file and the old DF now. It might take a few hours while I re-acquaint myself with DF and its horrendous UI.

Edit2: The zip I have contains a whole bunch of typical save data - a load of art_image-#.dat, and mostly unit-#.dat (where # is any given series of numbers appropriate to the particular file), but no world.sav or world.dat.

We decided to play Saints Row the Third. We start it up and use his character that had everything on it. When we get in the game we notice that there are no npcs around. everywhere we go there is no one. He quits and starts it up again and once again no one is around. My friend looks into the distance and sees some cars moving. he goes up there and he starts killing people. All npcs except cops start running away. Eventually he gets killed. When he re-spawns all of the civilians are gone and there are only cop cars driving around. We got bored and stoped playing the game. Is this just some kind of glitch?,t5_2tv55,True

1363200273.0,1a8byq,Anyone remember Echo Night? (PS1),albertvii,43,7,7,"Growing up I always watched my friends play horror PS1 games (which I was too much of a pussy to play) which for some reason scared me a hell of a lot more than the modern games we see today


One game in particular though was Echo Night, the game played in first person view (which was difficult to move around in since the analog stick wasn't around at the time this game was released). I watched my friend play the game as the story unfolded about finding your missing father who suddenly vanished, after searching your father's house, you find a hidden room in his house with a picture of a giant cruise boat, which then you magically get transported on the boat, where the rest of the game mainly takes place.


The boat was unsettling, you can always hear giggling, leaving things more unsettling, usually there isn't any music to accompany it, just silence and the occasional giggle. If you look around, you'll eventually run into [this girl.](http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/9/f/gfs_42071_2_44.jpg) If you happen to make eye contact with her, she'll pick you up using some supernatural power and throw you across the room, the only 'weapon' you will have is light


The entire game consisted of solving puzzles and going back into the past of certain events that some ghosts of the ship had gone through and you try to right what was wrong. All while avoiding the creepy ghost girl (and other ghosts later as you progress further in the game).


Whatever it was about this game, and yet I haven't seen any other games like it. I used to hide my head under the pillow when I turned the light off in my room because of fear of hearing a girl giggle. 


Aside from the personal experiences of this (and leading me to writing this entry to /r/creepygaming) there was a time I was watching my friend play the game and he progressed pretty far into the story, and the other door that takes you to another part of the ship), and a light switch (which at the time was turned off), you can also see a railing with a view of the ocean and other irrelevant parts of the ship. My friend turned the light on and continued to play but just as we were about to proceed through the door we heard a similar GIGGLE outside on that dock area.


We instantly thought ""Huh


The dock area was dark and we looked around as we can still hear the giggling, it floated at you, and ended up attacking him. The screen in the game shook tremendously and put him in a possessed state which he needed an item to fix that and then he needed to heal himself. But that apparition/whatever the fuck that thing was nearly killed him in one blow. 


The strange thing in this game is that 'ghost' has no significance to the rest of the game at all


Unfortunately

Everything was fine, usually this puts the chell model in the door with these glowing white eyes, which is creepy enough but it only lasts for a few seconds before cutting to a screen about the multiverse being created.

On my first play through the trigger for this was set off early. Almost as soon as I walked through the door there was a camera shutter sound so i turned around and was presented with a model of Chell in a warped position (sort of crouching with her arms open as if to grab something/ someone) with yellowish glowing eyes. I wasn't expecting this to happen at all and stood/ wandered around the room thinking the game had broken for about a minute. Finally i turned and pressed the button the camera immediately zooms straight in on this other chells face before cutting to the default cutscreen.

I played it through again wondering if this was the intentional outcome of the level but the other Chell only appeared once the button had been pressed and wasn't nearly as unnerving.

It was, tortured dead souls acting as your guide (one dressed in a full body bondage suit), themes such as self-mutilation, suicide, suicide bombings, terrorism, rape, and extreme violence all drenched in a twisted surreal landscape with some of the most uncomfortable and eerie music composed for gaming.. and to top it off

I was playing Assassin's Creed 1 in the Rich District of Jerusalem, and found the one in the NW walled area (where you go after Talal). I killed the Templar and got the message for him being added to my collection.

As I went to leave the walled area, still chasing me! I waited for him to climb up and killed him again. This time no message appeared, and it still showed me as being chased.

I ran out into the main part of the district, not a single monk or vigilante to be found. It was just me and him in what was suddenly a ghost town.

I waited for him in an open area, but this time it showed me that I had returned to being anonymous.

I ran up to a minaret (viewpoint in muslim districts) to see if I could spot anyone in my area of the city, knowing that at least I'd be safe up there.

When I reached the top, but allows you to distinguish between friend and foe) to see if I could spot him from a distance (seeing how he evidently always started chasing me at his spawn point). I kept looking, but didn't see him. I jumped off the tower into a nearby haypile and looked waited again, facing the direction of his spawn point.

Suddenly

I tried hiding in more places, and before I could parry and counter, he attacked and killed me. I, of course, was desynchronized and sent back to an earlier save point in the city. When it finished loading, the city had returned to normal and I was anonymous. Needless to say I shut the game off and didn't play it for a long time after that!

Now, as I've accessed that glitch in Acre), or having him continually chase me until he killed me wouldn't have been so bad had there been other people there. But the two in unison made the experience truly creepy, and more than a little scary. It honestly felt like the game was demanding my death, and bending the rules of gameplay, continually reincarnating this undead Templar hellspawn in order to achieve that, at the time. o.O But it was just a glitch - something that the Assassin's Creed games are riddled with!

Let me preface by saying

I do not know what to think of this game yet. I have only played 1 character out of 6. It is not ""scary"" in the normal sense of the word. Definitely not jumpy. But there is some sort of build up that happens while playing; the loneliness

The atmosphere is beautiful, vapid cartoon show before going to bed just to get my mind off of it. In the mean time, I will continue playing it a little at a time.

_______________________

So anyway, I actually got to the ""good"" ending. The one breaking the fourth wall. The one where Irisu fucking **walks over your desktop into the game with a spike club on an unsuspecting girl**, and the game closes itself.

http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8a230ZG6f1qfzma8.jpg

Now I did open the game again and see the ""happy birthday""-ending. Confused

By this point my skin was fucking crawling and the hairs on my neck felt like they were about to pierce the back of my head. *But intrigued as I was

So on my first try, I guess I wasn't paying too much attention. But there she was. Her used-to-be transparent silhoutette slowly faded into a bloodyfied mess. And her eyes were like two big glowing rings.

That's when I said, and slammed my laptops lid.

I was not yet coming down from the panic, as I was standing in the hallway, I realized I was actually very afraid. I wasn't just a little scared from playing the game, but I was completely terrified. I stopped right in my tracks and lit every lamp in my vicinity.

I stepped out on my porch, she came up, sneaking, with a nailbat, on my desktop, then into the actual game window. And the girl she was walking towards had her back faced towards Irisu. At this time I **seriously** paniced. I was too afraid to move. I just stood there, and the only motion I dared doing was to draw from my cigarette. I cramped my back up towards the house wall. That way I wouldn't have anything to be afraid of. People don't come through walls.

As I walked back to my bed, typing this, 1 hour and 40 minutes later, and I still don't think I'm gonna sleep tonight.

Oh. And I'm 20 years old.

I'll type up our experiences later when I am at my desktop.

What LBP (the original or the sequel) levels have psychologically scared you

EDIT: Here's our experience.

There are many copied levels in the ""Cool Levels""

One level lacked a scoreboard and a finish line.  We commented about it

We shivered at a level icon of a black-and-white Sackboy and had the level name ""survival"".  That isn't relevant

After a while

We were used to seeing bland levels.  It was actually *easy* to comment on bland levels

The world opened on a cliff.  It had the Wedding background and the fog looked like rust.  There was a row of jetpacks to the right

The floor of the hole was electrified

In the background, the boundary between Earth and the Underworld in Greek mythology.

We flew over the scoreboard, so we looked up ""lara"" on the Web.  [Supposedly, it can mean ""face"" or ""mug"".](http://www.interglot.com/dictionary/es/en/translate/lara)  It can also be a person's name.

Some of this creator's other levels also seem desolate or unfinished.  We tried ""playroom"" next.  At the start we were in what we thought was the ""playroom"" the creator was making.  There's a table with potatoes on it and a TV nearby.  If you climb up the platforms, which takes you to a white structure with a music box in it.  Later, there is a wooden sackboy on a suspended rubber platorm.  After that, there are three sackboys, the second of which says ""are you"".

I guess unfinished levels are unnerving to me.  We've considered the possibility that the levels ""lara"" or ""boda"" are memorials to someone.

Well as we played, we got Raziel out and into the graveyard. Still the whispers were loud and incoherent. I remembered that it wasnt like this last time i had played. When it got to Kain again and i grabbed the controller. The damn whispering was still goin. 
We debated reseting but it seemed like a cool glitch. But since the voice acting and story were one of my favorites
Tried several resets and even deleted the save file and started again. Now the whisperings were in Kain's introductory level. We said fuck it and just played through the game. 
The entire game was over burdened with those whisperings of the damned. It started to annoy and eventually creep us out. We could start to make out words that werent there. Hearing our names, hearing  places that we knew. 
We attributed it to our over active horror driven subconsciousness and imaginations. 
eventually we trudged through the game and finished it. I decided to give it to another gamer friend of mine. Informing him of the issue

Anyway. Perhaps this game does not completely fit in the 'creepy' genre as it's basically a game of gathering resources and building your base. What you usually do is find some wood
But...

The night time in this game is absolutely amazing when it comes to creepiness. I'm telling you

Now


Something else also. You have expanded your base and you plan on adding a third floor. The base is at the bottom of a hill. On a silent night you start working on your third floor and something on the hill catches your attention. It's 2 guys staring at you with a campfire behind them so you can very clearly see their silhouettes. They just stand there the whole night.




Don't know if anyone else who has played it feels like this but I haven't been scared in the dark like this for a while. The music is also a big factor (or sometimes the lack of it).

I'm going to look through some vods of a streamer

This happened back in an old update when the hunger bar was just introduced and mobs didn't have armor yet. I started my first world and spawned in a plain of grass with a lot of large hills. Even standing on top of these hills I couldn't see much apart from the sea in the distance and a few mountains. I decide to travel for a while before finally making a small house carved into a rock face. Being a noob it didn't take me long to die and without a bed yet I was sent straight back to the spawn. The combination of the landscape and the fact that it was dark creeped me out quite a lot. I got lost and couldn't find my way back to the house I made. While roaming through the hills I came to a kind of bowl shaped valley with hills on each side. I looked along it and at the mobs that were spawning and saw something strange on the other side. There was what I could only describe as an orange thing with the same shape as the snow men you can make. It seemed to have no describable head and was the same texture as the leather in the game. It was moving normally in the way mobs move when they aren't active. I wanted to get closer to whatever it was but before I could get anywhere I was killed by a spider. I was sent straight back to spawn again. After a while of checking the minecraft wiki I realized they never introduced a mob of this description into the game. I have never found any other reports of this glitch before and I have deleted the world since. It kind of reminded me of the Herobrine stories and it creeps me out to play it anymore.,t5_2tv55,True

After watching ""Game of Thrones"" I was in the mood for some Skyrim action.  I have it for the xbox so I put it in and begin a new profile.  I play for a few days and get passed where *spoiler: Skjor gets killed by the Silver Hand.  I take his armor and use it as my own because its free and its the best I have that early in the game.  I did it the first time I played through and figured why not do it again.

A few days and numerous side quests later I was wandering the countryside when I see a naked character headed straight toward me moving straight through trees and terrain as if they weren't there.  I get closer and see that it must be some kind of glitch because the person is half sticking out of the ground with only his torso showing and its head faced upward toward the sky frozen but moving.  Then I realize its Skjor.  I follow him for a while and realize his half naked body is headed back to Whiterun.  I think nothing of it

Days later after playing a few hours making iron daggers and increasing my enchantment skill I save while in Winterhold and turn off my xbox and head to bed.  Later that night I wake up to low sounding bass.  I listen for a moment and it sounds like low pounding drums.  At first I thought it was coming from my neighbor upstairs but then recognize its the drums from the main menu of Skyrim.  I figured someone was playing Skyrim late night.  I struggled to get back to sleep and I then hear Skjor's voice talking about how the Dragonborn still has to prove himself.  This time it distinctely sounded like it came from my living room.  So I get up to check it out and see a soft glow on the wall from around the corner from my television.  I turn the corner and see my t.v. not only on but with Skjor standing close to the screen naked staring silently.  My xbox had turned back on and my character had also gone back to Jrrovaskr and was staring at Skjor but it really felt like he was staring at me through the screen.  I moved closer and at first I didn't notice it because I was focused on the screen but as I look pass the soft glow of the television I saw a dark shadowy figure standing in the corner that looked to disappear into the wall as I moved closer.    I don't know if what I saw was real and I don't know how my television turned on or how my character had returned to Jrrovaskr but I turned it off and don't plan on playing Skyrim anytime soon.",self,t5_2tv55,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/rzhsz/skyrim_xpost_from_rnosleep/

But it was conceivably much more intricate

My teenage mind was too small to contain everything the game threw at me at the time

The first time I came into contact with the game was through a demo. This demo was distributed as most demos were in that time: through a CD which came with a then-popular gaming magazine. The internet existed but was unfortunately unavailable to me because of the costs.

I happily played through the demo, which created a somewhat comical effect rather than a scary one. And this, too, was intentional because (dark) humour was on of the game's cornerstones. After playing the demo, I found a full version in a store that didn't normally carry videogames, which was strange in itself. I couldn't resist bringing it home with me though.

One thing that wasn't comical or dainty at all, the music would only play if you had inserted the CD (this was long before terabyte-sized harddisks) and even then only at specific points and for short periods of time. While playing, you were easily distracted by the gameplay itself and the sounds of the fighting - gunshots, shrieks, zombies yelling...

But once you inserted the CD into a CD-player
This claim is easily verifiable for anyone who owns the original CD-ROM of the game. I lost mine during a move

The reason this music is relevant to this subreddit and not just a casual mention of something scary, and then cut out.
This isn't necessarily paranormal nor a conspiracy - in that day and age

I could go on and write a pasta about how the music turns you insane etc... but I won't
Just be somewhat prepared and don't say you weren't warned.

* Recovering from some terrible injury in a hospital
* Limited supplies, realistic amount of damage similar to how it works in the Siren games.
* Mysterious and extremely oppressive enemies
* Mysterious story, or maybe it's a coma or maybe it's simply a strange and horrifying place.

So, I had placed a Steve head on a bridge that lead to one of the other relevant rooms. The Steve head was sort of peeking around the corner at the player when they start the walk on the bridge. Next, we have some random Steve heads that I placed on the floor as a joke. Lastly we have the room in which the bridge leads to. Inside the room, there are three Steve heads, each next to a sign with a reference to the merchant from Resident Evil 4.

So
Anyway, this isn't creepy and I didn't think anything of it at the time. 

I then went up to the bridge and saw that my Steve head had been replaced with a skull head. Instead of peeking around the corner, but a later occurrence made me believe that it wasn't him. But before that, I went back downstairs and noticed that the randomly placed Steve heads in which I had placed earlier were now mixed in with white skull heads. My friend also swore he hadn't done that too.

Now for the final thing. Some signs around the castle started turning blank for no reason. We went to the ""merchant room"". My friend suddenly told me that to him one of the Steve heads next to the sign looked like the white skulls. I was immidietly freaked out
The fact that he was really freaking out told me this wasn't his doing. He told me to stand next to it as proof and then sent me this screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/Tn3Jr.png (That's me standing next to the skull). After seeing this

I don't remember the events leading up to how I got to playing the game... but I remember playing out in a field. It wasn't Hyrule Field or Termania. What I was playing didn't represent any of the games at all; although the Link in my nightmare was the same as Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. There wasn't any background details, it burst into flames, and a second Link appeared. There was nothing different about him, it was an exact duplicate of me. I thought maybe the game in my dream had glitched... until the second Link decided to take a swing at my Link and killed me. So the game gives the usual ""Game Over"" music and screen; but no option to continue playing. The screen flashed for a second and then went black. It came back up with the ""Dawn of the First Day"" screen, which was odd because this wasn't Majora's Mask. It went to the unknown field where Link was just standing there, but there was no action buttons on the screen and I couldn't control him. Link started to flash... the background was still. He turned black; similar to Dark Link. It had the glowing red eyes, too. This was slightly different though... because Link was still a child, lined with massive fangs. It turned around for a second, similar to when Link changes a location. It came back, and she seemed to be floating. I didn't see it for long though

That night, but as me, in the actual room. It looked exacly the same and the music was playing in the dream too.

He that this room, and rooms below it, are part of ""sacred geometry"" that in use with that sound, would create some kind of pattern. He said that I couldn't talk to anyone about this when I woke up (and that really freaked me out). 

He then snapped his fingers and teleported me to the big middle chamber in dark Anor Londo, and I went into that state in dreams where your eyes are wide open and all you feel is absolute fear. That woke me up.

About 5 years prior to the events I'm about to describe
My job was to stock the shelves with games
seeing the old games I had to stock. On July 7th
I got in my car
was a batch of used games to stock on the shelves in the used game category. 

Most of the games were GBA games
Banjo Kazooie. As I started sorting the games on the shelves I again felt the nostalgia of seeing old games
especially with Banjo Kazooie. At the bottom of the pile I spotted something unusual
I was curious
pretty sure no-one would want it so I put it at the back of the shelf.

A few months later, right where 
I had put it. Alot of the games around it had been bought
this was because it was for the original gameboy and most people don't have those. Except me. My curiosity spiking
I took the game off the shelf and took it to the back of the store
the game
and finished up work.



11:07 PM

By the time I got back to my house
and had had several drinks. I flopped down on the couch, I pulled it out of my pocket.
I left it on the table
Rummaging through the contents of the attic

I walked back downstairs, with a normal title
and dull background music. I pressed start and selected save 1
no doubt from the previous owner. At first the save started up normally
Samus was missing from the screen
It was a bit wierd
the camera

Before I could do anything
and the game started up normally. I selected save 1 again
strangely enough I had one energy tank and the plasma beam. I assumed the plasma beam was the beam you started with in the game
having never played it before. The game proceeded normally
""Crap!"" I exclaimed
that the game cartridge was corrupted. Suddenly the start menu loaded
I started

I was pretty sure that the cartridge was just broken
I was back at the spaceship
I decided to try playing again,
and Samus's arms exploded into blood. And it was red. Blood was pouring everywhere. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it
game to have color. After a few more seconds Samus appeared on the floor, but it was different.
It sounded twisted
She was standing over the body of Samus

It was samus, as if looking into the void. Text appeared: ""I am Aran. Forgotten, 
but not alone. At least I have YOU!"" The game flashed between the picture and red. I screamed and dropped the gameboy. My clock struck midnight. I ran towards
my kitchen

---------------------------

When I woke up, and looking at my bedside table, saw my gameboy and the cartridge. The cartridge was smashed,
like it was hit with a sledgehammer. The game title was busted up, and chucked it in my garbage bin.
I quit my job at Best Buy

I found out about The Crooked Man from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/1h0fs3/the_crooked_man_awesome_ao_oni_style_horror_game/). The title of said post mentioned that the game is similar to Ao Oni

**Graphics:** TCM looks like it came straight out of the SNES era, which was a welcome distraction from wading through paragraphs of dialogue. 7/10

**Puzzles:** The puzzles are not terribly difficult. There were a few times where I had to jot a few notes down on a sticky note, so if you take a minute to think about how to do something, you'll be rewarded. I got stuck maybe once or twice. On those occasions, the [walkthrough](http://www.vgperson.com/games/crookedman.htm) was helpful. 8/10

**Scariness:** One of this game's strongest facets was its ability to instill a sense of uneasiness in the player. I was never sure if any of my actions were going to trigger an unwelcoming (or disturbing) event (granted, so I had to take a break. There are a few jump scares, but they are used sparingly. There are a few situations in the game that actually cause the entire atmosphere of the game to boil away, IMO. I'm talking about [the times when you have to fight and classical music plays in the background.](/spoiler) During those times, I was almost completely taken out of the game's world. A bit of a drawback, but all in all, the game is pretty thrilling. 7/10

**** (VERY MINOR) SPOILER ALERT BELOW****

One of the downsides of TCM (in my opinion) is [the amount of time it takes to inspect each and every room on every floor. On one hand, doors that can never be opened, and objects that simply can't be inspected. Plus, it was a bit annoying to have to run up and down multiple floors in search of the next unlockable door. For comparison, I think Ao Oni (v. 6.23) did a better level design work than TCM, simply because you didn't have to waste 5 minutes going through the wrong hallway unnecessarily. -3 coolness points](/spoiler)

**** END (VERY MINOR) SPOILER ALERT ABOVE****

**Last Comments:** This was definitely a game that was worth playing. Although I didn't go into it here, this was a well done game that any horror game fan should check out.

Ok so heres how it all starts. I Download an illegal copy of San Andreas off a torrenting website. After installing all goes smooth
   
I opened up the save file 1. And i spawn next to that famous muddy lake. (i cant find a picture ill look for one later) So I dont think much of it and look online for some sort of vehicle cheat to get out of there. I type it in and it doesnt accept it. I try it several times to no avail.
    
I finally decide to walk out of there and onto a road to steal a car and go to Grove Street. When i get to a main road i see no cars anywhere. Not a single person either. Im a bit creeped out at this point. so i start running on the road and the first thing i hear is footsteps. I hear my own footsteps and another too. I heard the overlapping of the footsteps. I heard mine then another immediately after. I turn around and dont see anything. It was easy to hear due to the lack of music or cars engines in traffic.
    
I run all the way down a road

I open up my map to set the waypoint for Grove Street, what used to be a nice dark green is now a dull mint green color. Yet again, Glitch right ? i close my map after setting the waypoint and as soon as i close the map, the worst, most horrifying scream ever, a female scream loud as hell followed by running footsteps. But nobodys around me. Thats when shit (pardon my language) gets scary, the continuous screaming, then complete silence for a few seconds. I lowered my volume and ran from that area
      
I go into the Johnsons house to see if the weapons were in the kitchen. But no weapons. So i go outside and i nearly shit my pants. The game starts lagging like hell, From all gangs, Mexicans, Ballas, OGF, all. Dead and i hear a low humming now, i turn my volume up and it gets louder, and everything is gone. Nobody is at Grove now, only [Y - Pick Up] shows up, but i knew this was something else.
      
When i hear  that i hang up immediately, i couldnt close it, it gave me a 'Grand Theft Auto: San andreas (not responding)' window (BTW im on Windows 7)   I close my laptop and turn it off. i boot it back up and i still hate Windows for this, instead of it booting up fresh, it did windows resume. Goddamn it, why did it do that ? As soon as i enter my password i see Carl dead. But instead of it saying 'wasted' it says ""It got you..."" Carl stands back up and im shitting myself right now.

**The Story**

Shady Palms Resort, water, death. It was closed in 1975 after a massacre where an employee at the resort lost his mind and killed all the staff on duty and three fourths of the residents before killing himself. Shady Palms is said to be haunted by the ghost of the killer and the residents and staff that he murdered. But there’s more to the story than that. Interest in the abandoned location started popping up after an urban explorer wrote a post about the resort on his blog. He reported that he heard the ghosts of the residents and staff, was threatened the ghost of the killer, and saw the blood stained hotel rooms. But he also reported locked and bolted doors that seemed to be untouched and strange messages written on the walls of the killer’s former office. The most frightening and interesting find of all, though, was several children that would appear in doorways he had just gone through, and then disappear. Photos of the children that he had taken and uploaded were revealed to be corrupted and glitched to the point where you couldn’t tell what the photo was supposed to be of. He also stated that he would hear the children whispering to him “Help. Help us.” He also heard the children walking around the hallways he had just gone through and calling out “Daddy?”

You have decided to explore the resort, talk to ghosts, and avoid danger you find out things about Shady Palms that you rather would live without knowing.

Later on this week I might make a page on this and post the link. Until then

It was a love-hate relationship between me and my assistant. We are both recognized by the state as doctors of science. We practice a wide range of studies. Our methods differ, it was strong. Our work was our first priority for a long time. We would slave day after day, night after night. I push myself to the brink of insanity coming up with the most complicated schematics, mapping brain functions, creating power cells, working with various metals and compounds. My partner would draw up plans and gather materials. I would never say that he is beneath me, but there was a reason he was my assistant and not a co-worker. This would be why the events unfolded in such a way


I cried tears of joy the day my Son was born. Work was set aside as I played the role of father (and mother). He was a miracle, I would walk with him around our house, and show him books to read, and explain things about the outside world. I was so naïve. For all the book smarts I had accumulated, I knew nothing of the real world. The monsters in the wilderness were nothing compared to the one lurking in my laboratory. If I had only realized, the greatest threat to me was wearing a lab coat and pretending to be my assistant.

   
It didn’t take long to find out there were serious problems with my Son. He was having problems with his heart, he said no. My son told me that he did not want to be saved. I cried and stomped my foot as he opened the door and walked out of his home. I fell to pieces on the living room floor, and my wretched assistant approached me and put his dark scheming hands on my back in a comforting manner. He told me he would find my son, and bring him home. I was relieved, knowing he was on my side. I watched him run after my beloved child and had no idea that he was going to stab me in the back with this very act.


He died in my assistants arms. That’s what he wants me to think. I know better now. I was so stupid when he told me. Depression and longing blinded me from the truth. He was smirking. I couldn’t see it. My assistant was a ruthless liar. He told me that he found my son, and put a bullet in his head. He is why my son is an abomination, and my first born is dead.


I was determined. This time I won’t screw up the heart. My assistant worked diligently with our current projects. Directors of major companies were calling, he was kind and helpful. I was on such a roll; I even started working on a little girl. I was proud of myself again, and nothing would stop me. How could I have been so delusional? The Monster was getting ready to make his move. I would never be so devastated in my life. This would be the end of me. That arrogant prick of a human, scum of the earth, would cause me to do something that I would rather commit suicide than remember.
I watched him take my projects. He laughed at me, stealing every project, their schematics, every shred of evidence that any of it came from my genius. I was powerless to stop them. The monster ripped everything I own, everything I love, almost.
 

I still had him. My new Son is still with me. I knew what I had to do. The only thing I could do. I needed those projects back. I needed my life back. I felt like my whole world had collapsed. I spent my time working with these pathetic kids and missed the obvious signs that my fake assistant was going to ruin me. I grabbed my Son. I put him on the table. He was scared. He was crying. I grabbed a saw and a screwdriver. I started work. 


It’s my hope. You will become what I need you to be. You will give me my life back. I entrust this task to you


While he was screaming, I added weapons and a powerful helmet was screwed onto his skull.


I will name him Megaman...

I was reading a thread yesterday which made me nostalgic for Shadow of the Colossus

I wandered the map for probably 2 hours, I didn't immediately notice that she had disappeared while I was searching the cliff sides for lizards. 

I figured she had glitched and knew she'd respawn next to me when I loaded up my game

At this point

The cave entrance which I had previously gone through was now a giant

As expected, with little odds and ends floating in grey space. It looked a bit like the animus loading area in Assassin's Creed. 

Then I turned around again.

Aggro had loaded

A little bit later the landscape around us loaded, and was relieved to see her spawn healthy and new again. I gave her a few pats on the side and rode her around for a bit before deciding to shut off the game.

Was probably one of the weirdest glitches I've encountered. It was as if Aggro was upset that I'd abandoned her.

This is only my second pasta

Pokemon isn't the only game that resolved around the characters being named off of colors. Take Gunstar heroes and Gunstar Suped Heroes for example. It was really fun. I loved it a ton. I never got into the original game because of how hard it was
	
Just the other day I attempted to replay  Gunstar Super Heroes. I heard the lovely snap of the game and the on button, and I noticed the plastic on the game cartridge was broken. Then the memories flowed back from my childhood. I always got a bit too mad and overreacted, and I bit the game to save me from the  frustrating difficulty of the game. God, I was stupid. 

	I went to the lovely world of interwebz and typed "" Is there a third game in the Gunstar series?"" My finger slammed on the enter key and I clicked on the nearest Yahoo! Answers link. I always find it reliable. I'd sit here and tell you why, but there was somebody claiming to have at one point worked for Sega on a Gunstar three. He said it got bagged do to poor sales despite their positive ratings, but he has a copy of a beta on a disc for the GameCube. His English seemed to be a little bit off, so it seemed possible. I looked at the user's account and got the usual message when somebody is banned. 

	eBay was my next option. Personally, I googled who the guy was. I forgot his name now, most likely because he preferred to to be called ""Majin."" I figured he adopted this from the Sonic CD soundtrack thing. Google found his Facebook, and I started my stalkerish browsing. I finally decided to contact this guy and ask him if I could have a copy of the Beta. 
	
He said no. My heart deflated. Just then AVG said it found a malware on my computer. I looked and saw that I already had a copy of Gunstars 3 on my computer. I was very skeptical about this
I then checked my Facebook messages and received an ""XD LOL"" out of him. He said that he was just joking around and that I could have it. I unplugged my webcam and closed the tabs I had running, which I clicked in. The other file contained something called ""Gunstar Anti Heroes"". The readme said, ""Don't be scared buddy. I'll remove the Keylog. There was just no other way to give it to you without everybody else in SEGA knowing. I want to remodel everything and name it something else, but first I need a tester. That is where you will help me. I give you the game you want, I get to make the game I want.""
	This was a creepy thing to say

	""Can you see me?"" I questioned. I received no answer. I asked again. No answer. I unplugged the camera again

	The game started off with a story

	""After Blue and Red's perils, of course. They became richer than most people's hearts desire, and became very powerful. They became legends. This power went to their heads. They became brutal. They wanted to become rulers. Dictators, even. A new group of heroes has formed to stop their conquest, and only your performance can decide whether they succeed or not.""

	I then went to the character select screen. Must have been a new feature. To my surprised, her always being my favorite character. She had the coolest gun, and this game was no exception. It was a minigun, bazooka, and a shotgun type weapon. I booted up the first stage. It seemed to be like GSSH, except a little bit brighter. I noticed red was wearing sun glasses. I walked left after a skydiving cutscene, and after laying a few enemies to waste, I was instructed to shoot a rocket down the hole to see if there was a bottom to it by Yellow. I heard multiple screams that sounded like your basic enemy shouts

	As I went through a falling scene similar to the falling scene from Pink's stage in both the games. I landed on some dead enemy soldier's bodies, begging for help. Red stood there, looking at the soldier for about three seconds. Then a sudden zoom in on Red's face, and a very short cut scene started. 
""You are against my ways."" Red stated. ""For this
The soldier looked at red for a few seconds
""What? Scared of the inevitable end to everybody and everything? Fear no more
	The game cut back to... Well... The game and showed a small animation of Red stomping on the Soldier's head as it went motionless. There was no blood

	I stood around for a few seconds in shock of what I saw and then it cut to another cutscene.
""OH COME ON!!!"" Shouted Red

	This only shocked me even more. This was so... Mature... After a few seconds

	I eventually got going. I went into the second screen. There was immediately the big armadillo type guy guarded by two turrets guarded by soldiers. The armadillo guy came towards me, but the two soldiers crowding the turrets crouched down and started shaking. Red walked towards them slowly and equipped the shotgun. These cutscenes are painful to watch, and I was grateful the wasn't one. Instead, we got an in game animation. Red grabbed one of the soldiers by its shirt and laughed. 	The soldier started squirming around and crying for help. The second soldier got up and the screen turned red. Not completely red, but everything was a black outline. The soldier picked up its gun and shouted something I couldn't understand in anger. He shot his gun and missed, and Red shot him. It reached up into the air for one second, and died as the redness faded as the soldier Red was holding started crying of sorrow, fear. Red dropped him. The soldier on all fours, I didn't want to look away. The soldier fell over, then back at the one she had just kicked. Red walked away as the soldier lay on the ground
	
""Meh
	
"" Thank you..."" The scientist wheezed.

	""Naw

	I had never seen a spike model in the game before. Maybe this game was a platformer? The Blue Gunstar shot at Red, Red grabbed the Blue Gunstar's head and started violently smashing it against her knee. I was given a quick time event were I had to gnash the A button a lot to hit the Blue Gunstar's head on Red's knee, and press the the 8 key followed by the 4 key to throw him out a window. There was screaming, but not the usual enemy screaming. This seemed to be a sound chip inserted from a recorder instead of an 8-bit type sound. 
	
""NO
That was followed by a shorter scream shouting "" DADDY!!!""
	The Red Gunstar got up and shot Red in the bad of the head. There was still no blood
	
The Red Gunstar looked disgusted. He began to take the minigun of the scientist as Blue jumped through the broken window, similar  to before, but this time I saw Red's face in the upper right corner of the screen, staring upwards at a star smirking, as if representing her legacy as a soldier and hero, and forgetting her wrongdoings. There was a twinkle in her eye, and she appeared to be a little bit teary. I started to get teary, and this beautiful picture was her memorial. Such a great hero, and he charged towards the Red Gunstar

	Blue took the glass he picked up and slashed the back of the Red Gunstar's neck slightly, and said, "" Help, I'm bleeding!!!"" Blue grabbed the Red Gunstar's head and smashed it on the minigun on top of the scientist's back,forcing the scientist to fall forward and get skewered, but The Red Gunstar was untouched. A similar quick time event happened with the Red Gunstar and Blue smashing  The Red Gunstar's head on his knees, but then he smashed his enemy's head on the ground, The Gunstar's body went limp
	
Blue dropped to his knees as little stars fell from his eyes
	
""Whoops
	

""Oh
	The screen faded back to Blue. 
	""Whoops..."" Said Blue. ""Dropped my gun..."" Blue dove off the cliff after it, I just wanted to stare at that picture of red a little longer. I called the police about this ""Majin"" person but nobody believed me. All the cameras on my computer don't work, and my video camera got broken while I was recording a video. 
	
About three weeks later I decided to check my computer for the Keylog again. Then I noticed something. I never closed out of AVG, though. Blue was there, doing the same exact thing. On the bottom right of the picture there was a message that read,""You have two webcams. I saw the reaction I wanted out of you. Here is your reward.""
	I planned on calling the police

Funny, but what would happen if I did?

after I while I did, punched wood, made a shack, made some tools, since the music in this game was fantastic, I would just walk out and enjoy the peacefulness of the day. This is when some ghost player started doing strange things.(I cannot confirm if herobrine or not.)

I seen a player who appears to be using the Steve skin, as if it was shocked to see me, and it said in the chatbox: ""Why did you leave me."" I noped right out of the game, re-joined, he wasn't there, then the chatbox went at it again, I'll mark numbers to represent who's speaking, 2 means it.

2""Why did you leave me.""

1 ""what do you mean?""

2 ""you can't leave.""

1 ""Why not?""

2 ""you left me

1 ""Yes I can.""

Then the game just turned off, but I know something may happen.


I thought, but what was weird it would respond to me, keep track or the conversation, I shrugged it off and just decided to delete the game, not expecting some average ""sp00ky computer lol."" things to happen like in the stories, I asked people about this player on minecraft forum, only one person replied, it was either the player referring to me as if I was stalking it

""The thing is

Then at the bottom of the goddamn google chrome bar, back to the most recent version of the game, I wanted to talk to it, again, loaded a new world, I started in a jungle.

Then the chatbox said exactly the same thing as the comment on my post, it was deleted, the reason why I looked was to see the name of the commentor.

1. ""What do you want.""
2. ""you.""
1. ""I don't care if you're real

UPDATE: Today I got a package, I decided to stay somewhere secure, populated and I could be protected at my most vulnerable state, but there was no where I could go, I went on minecraft to talk to him.

1. ""Kill me if you want.""
2. ""You are me.""
1. ""Well guess what

UPDATE 2: Hey guys, he told me his reddit account's password, I got a letter from the supposed stalker, it was a note saying when I get the note, it said: ""I will kill himself."" I thought, I will kill himself? It was either a grammar mistake or he actually think's he is ToastedBacon, I will not use TB's real name.

I was feeling brave.  I tried downloading the game.  The link was broken.  All that was in the description was "".DND."" and then the link under that, I just exited the browser and decided to play Amnesia, since I was in the horror game mood.  But as soon as I exited the browser, my computer froze.  After sitting there for a while I decided it wasn't going to fix itself.  I tried turning it off normally.  Didn't work.  Then I did the thing that always works; Taking out the battery.  And surprisingly, that didn't work.  The screen was still frozen.  It was of my desktop, but something was off.  In the top right corner, where I put my Recycling Bin, titled "".DND.""
That really creeped me out, to see if anything would happen.  When I came back...

The screen was pure red.  Brick red.  Blood red.  I wiggled the mouse.  Nothing.  So I closed the laptop (It was a laptop) and then left it again.  It was late, so I had to wait yet again.  When I finally got back from school, though, I raced up to my room to find my laptop open, at the login screen.  Both my parents go to work before I'm even up for school, so they couldn't have messed with it while I was gone, because it was perfectly fine before I left for school.  Whatever.  I logged on, and everything looked fine.  There was no more "".DND."" In place of the Recycle Bin.  All looked fine.  But me, and now it had trash in it, and I saw a .exe file labeled "".DNP.""  I booted it up

These past few days had been creepy, and the screen went black (Or just took away the play option).  After waiting, for what seemed like forever, something came up.  It was a first person game.  I was in a very poorly pixelated field, fenced off so I can't leave, and there were Trees everywhere.  It almost reminded me of Slender, but there was no sound whatsoever, looking around at the crappy scenery.  Then I came across a cabin.

But not an ordinary cabin.  This cabin was very skinny and tall.  It would have looked like an ordinary cabin sprite if it was so distorted.  But still

As soon as I walked into it, and there was no exit.  I soon lost track of which way I was looking, as there was nothing on the screen to indicate where I was.  The only reason I knew that this game was still running was because of this faint, almost whisper like buzz coming from within the game.  It sounded almost like a baby.  It was so realistic, I peered around my bedroom, making sure that it was coming from my laptop.  Then, when I looked back at the laptop, so I went towards it.  It got closer and bigger the more I walked in its direction.  After walking for about three minutes, almost so distorted and messed up I couldn't handle it.  My whole body froze as this sound got louder and louder, me holding down the key

But it didn't come from the laptop.  It came from behind me.

At that moment I swung around in my chair, everything normal.  I scanned every inch of my computer to find something resembling that game, but nothing came up.  I was still shaking, almost crying.  It was the most vivid facial features I had ever seen.  I decided to go to bed.  That night, I had nightmares about it.  I woke up, screaming.  I looked around the room.  Everything was okay...  But I was still scared.  I couldn't help but feel that baby, that face...  Watching me in the darkness...  Where I couldn't see it, looking into the darkness.  Right when I close my eyes, so I had no school

I searched "".DND."" and what came up shocked me.

It was an abbreviation for ""Do Not Download.""  That startled me.  I looked up the other two ("".DNO."" "".DNP."").  But I already had an idea of what they meant.  "".DNO."" meant ""Do Not Open."" and "".DNP."" meant ""Do Not Play.""

It made sense

But it wasn't.  I trying finding the site again to report it for any reason I could

Thankfully.

To this day I still have nightmares about it, whispering ""Found You.""  I decided to never look up anything related to that again.  Who knows what else is out there.

1361689431.0,194gh1,New Game,xtremetoxicguy,9,9,5,"Bryce was playing another game of Minecraft. Murdering pigs, and knew his was around them all

   So time passed, which is not the recent version. He discovered the new items and functions, and then decided to play his old survival map. He noticed the world had changed from the update, but his builds remained the same. He then picked up his task he abandoned of finding diamonds, and picked up a iron pickaxe  and headed down a shaft underneath his house.

   As he finally reached the cave, which was still at normal, as usual. He quickly made the most of this opportunity, and rushed to find diamonds. Through the caverns he went. Up and down, left and right, but found nothing.

   Except for a mining shaft. But this was no ordinary shaft, so did his speed.

   The shaft was just a long tunnel, and wood posts. As he sprinted, he saw the end in the distance. He had sprinted till his food bar stopped him, and his patients began to run out. Then, he hit a door.

   Wondering what was inside, and a sign that read, ""if you were to find me"". He opened the chest to see a single sword. A diamond sword, with no enchantments or damage.

   He then placed it in his inventory. The hiss of a creeper was heard from the monitor. Bryce jumped at the sound, and was perfect for slicing zombies. Grassy hills, and trees around, but only one zombie was seen. 

  He jumped to sliced the creature to death

   His heart pumped as the computer booted up. It automatically set to the safe mode, it said, ""You do not take things from me...""

   But before he could even begin to be startled at that quote, only the title was shown in small font in front of a black background. He clicked Single Player, then was met with a save marking his name. He swore to himself he named it ""My World"", as he usually does. As his common sense returns, he then resets the computer back to its regular settings. Everything is normal as he searches the web about what he witnessed, to see if it was in the update somehow. No reply.

   He checks the folders to see if he put in a mod of that description. It was pure. He checked the game again without regret to see if everything went back to normal. He went with the save

   He tried breaking the wood, is played...backwards. Soon after, a player has joined the game. He knew for sure he was in single player, and the screen read ""        has joined"". By his fear, he tried to exit the game, with no luck. He goes to task manager, only to find he his still in the game.

   The screen then shots to his character falling into a bottomless pit as the sound of multiple ghasts screaming

   Days later, there were none spotted. He waited until he was brave enough to play it again. This were to be his last.

   Already when the launcher showed up, but surrounded by fire. The player was completely gone in third person, and soon fire engulfed the wood. 

   Then, and in the text box, wrote ""if you were to find me"" without a username. ""Danny"" was played backwards again, and hissing of creepers flooded the computer to freeze again. Instead of going to another crash screen, he was back at the long hallway, peering into the dark. His back was against a wall, and he saw a figure walking towards him.

   He pressed control, but failed. ""it is your turn"" said in the text box. He then tried unplugging the machine, and to his shock, the screen was still on. The figure moved closer and closer, his body shaking with fear. Ghasts and creepers were heard at full blast, and he could finally see the character. 

   It looked so familiar, and he left his computer to run out of his room. The door was locked.

   He saw as the blocky figure moved, not knowing what to do.

Then the computer shut off. 

   Bryce was found dead by the foot of his bed that same day. No marks, they searched his computer to find that there was no Minecraft to be seen. The computer was normal.

   He was accused of suicide

I sent it back for a refund but they were out of stock. So I went ahead and got it on steam during a sale. During the download a random text file came on my desktop reading *You could not kill her. I did.* I had no idea what it meant or how it got there. So I deleted it and began to play.


I noticed something was wrong at the very beginning. The title screen background was just pure black with the options. I thought it was just my old graphic card or a glitch so I started a new game. When the game started up normally except GLaDOS was nowhere to be heard and the starting room was a mess with a bunch of electric parts and wires. Probably the most unsettling thing was that a dark figure was looking out the windows of every chamber some had blood and others had him holding something I could not make out.


The game played quite normally besides that until I dove into a Rattman area. The walls were instead soaked in blood with some of the writing reading *It killed her


I made it to the final room where GLaDOS was intended to be but instead the dark figure stood in her place. The figure looked like a woman with black hair, *Kill me, or kill me again*, and *Help Me Please*. Written over and over.

I deleted all the files and re downloaded the game after ward and everything went back to normal. Although when I defeat GLaDOS she says *She brought me to hell you know. Than you brought her to it.*

I killed the thing and went on until I saw three in the level and decided to ""retreat"" and went to the Medical Pavilion. I saw one next to the first ADAM machine, where you first attack him. I saw an audio log and never have seen it before, but I guess I just missed it, but it was Sander Cohen's log! In it he said something about the statue splicers he helped make with Steinman and how they were killing his loyal splicers. I went to the Wiki and found nothing of this audio log.

I called my friend and told him to come over, then we started playing through the levels and shit, taking turns of course.

It started getting really disturbing, we tried Photobucket, Imgur and even Facebook but none worked. Then I was taken to the dashboard on my 360 and the save file had been deleted.

I decided that it would be an overpowered and awesome character and maybe that's why it was a secret. when I finished entering the code which I wont tell you for your own good when i went to the character select screen I saw the new character. The characters name was jealous Luigi. He was simply just luigi in marios clothes and I thought it was pretty funny. I played a time trial on rainbow road and that's when i noticed something very odd. something was tied to the back of the car. and then i saw it... it was mario. his eyes were as dark as black holes. I remembered why I didnt like this game as a kid. I instantly quit back to character select screen and noticed mario was gone and he was replaced with luigis model. I quit to the title and saw the game was named luigi kart and mario was laying there with luigi standing above him with a laugh that wouldnt stop playing. I went back to title screen and saw he was the only character left so i quit back to title again to have the same thing but everyone else was dead to.I quit the game and threw it out and never played a mario game again,t5_2tv55,True

1349293016.0,10w41q,Jack Hill - The Mystery Of Game And Watch,YES_Im_Taco,4,6,4,"Hello
I live in a high-rise studio apartment in Philadelphia.
Recently
Let me start at the beginning. Just a few days ago, I was abruptly awoken when I heard the sound of a disk being read near my television. I then rubbed my eyes and noticed that the Wii had been turned on. I didn’t think much of it; unusual things often occurred in my apartment – doors would open and close, lights would flicker on and off, etcetera.
Curious, and I was eager to reclaim my self-proclaimed title as the “Brawl Master”. I quickly set up a match between myself, R.O.B, and a level-nine computer player with a random character at a random stage.
After the load screen vanished, was revealed along with my enemy – Lucas from Mother 3. Before I delivered my first attack, however, I noticed that the name over the character did not say “CPU” as it usually does. Instead was the name “Jack H.” “That’s odd,” I thought. While I was pondering how the name got there, Lucas jumped to the ledge of the skyscraper that was near the corner of the stage. Suddenly, all in-game music stopped. I reached for the remote, in vain
“What’s wrong with this stupid thing?” I shouted. Then, the entire screen was inundated with static, accompanied by a loud screeching sound. I hastily fumbled for the remote and shut off the television. Sighing in relief, I headed toward the kitchen. I was dying for something to drink. I made it only half way to my destination before I was paralyzed by the baleful sight; on the counter lay a dusty Game and Watch. I slowly crept forward to find a note attached. It read, “You should play this game! It’s really, really fun!” At the bottom of the note was a sloppy signature, “Jack H.”
Confused and panicked, after all. I swiftly opened my door, and saw another note on the floor. Trembling, I picked it up and read aloud: “Come play with me! Jump down, I’ll catch you!” Once again, the note had the uncanny signature of “Jack H.”
The lights abruptly shut off
Suddenly, leaving my house in sheer bedlam. “Chris…” I murmured, catching my breath. “I was just about to have a smoke, and I heard you yelling… This place is trashed! What happened?” “Chris,” I asked, “Do you have any idea who ‘Jack H’ could be?” His eyes widened, and he asked, do you know him?” I asked. His face cringing in fear
We rushed into his place, who lived where you do now,” Chris quickly said, while gathering many of his belongings. “As you know, I’ve lived here for a very long time. Jack and Mary lived here several decades ago. Being a single mom, Mary worked two jobs to support herself and her child. She did whatever she could for the boy, but was rarely home to see him. She longed for her son to be happy
“…Yes, he was playing that game. He became so addicted to the game, that he skipped school one day to play it. After receiving notification from the school, his mother had no choice but to take the game away from him. Afraid that he would find the game, she explained the situation to me and asked me to keep it. Jack became hysterical; through the walls I heard him talking nonstop about the game, high scores, and how he ‘saved the day every time’. Though I found his rambling disconcerting, until that cold
“That night, I heard a door barge open, followed by a strange request: ‘Jump down, I’ll catch you!’ The last thing I heard was a terrified shriek next door. I ran there as fast as I could, but when I opened the door, all I saw was the deranged face of Jack Hill, standing next to the ledge of the balcony. ‘What have you done?’ I asked. He flourished a big smile, and jumped off of the building.”
After Chris told the story, but I know that Jack Hill had something to do with it. His rancor will never be put to rest, Sam. You need to move immediately, before it’s too late. I’m leaving now; best of luck to you.”
“You’re leaving already?” I asked, and descended to the first floor. As quickly as possible, I ran into my room, grabbed my wallet, and left that wretched apartment.

This continued until I was much farther ahead in the game.
Until finally
I heard A deafening scream through my headphones.
LEON!
Like any normal person
So I decided I would go ""look"" for ashley.
In the back of my mind I knew it wouldnt solve anything
I backtracked a few doors.
I came upon A breakable wooden door.
But something wasnt right..
It Was COVERED in blood.
My first thought was: I didnt do this..
My second thought was: What did this?
I kicked the door
But that's not what I got
I kicked the door in
I was standing in a circular room
There was what I thought was a female ganado kneeling over a body in the corner.

She got up
It was ashley
Her mouth was just Uh... If You took a cheese grader to someones lips

She stared at me for a couple seconds..
Her life bar flashed back to full and I immediately opened fire on her with my Red9 Handgun.
As her life dropped
I got the game over screen,

1368900329.0,1el516,Cry of Fear is so artistically vacant it borders on outright plagiarism.,Weeperblast,3,6,6,"Hello

I heard about this goldensource mod, without any real expectations other than the knowledge that Rich 'Lowtax' Kyanka, of somethingawful.com fame, did a LP on it, showcasing how terribly awful it is. That being said, somethingawful.com lampoons everything under the sun, so it could something worth playing.

Oh

I'm a big Silent Hill buff. All the endings, everything. The sheer amount of ideas that CoF took from Silent Hill is just appalling. It's like you're playing a Bizarro Silent Hill game made by FPS knuckleheads. It's the bottom-of-the-barrel, lowest-common-denominator garbage that relies on jump-scares and twitchy-bloody-guy with a knife shambling towards you.

I'm not going to suggest that Silent Hill is an entirely unique product; the streets of the town are named after inspirational authors. They've crafted their own product by taking measured bits from other sources

Here are some elements that I think were borrowed outright from the SH series. I might me wrong on some of these

* The player is a lone dude in a foggy
 
* The levels tend to have a normal side
 
* Some portions of the game involve walking over metal grates where creeps from below try to reach up and grab you
 
* The save point is 'somewhere I can record my thoughts for later'
 
* The soundtrack takes liberally from Yamaoka's styles
 
* One level is an apartment building where iron bars show up in the middle of the hallway
 
* The apartment building has rooms interconnected by a broken-down wall.
 
* The player goes through a sewer level
 
* The player goes through a bullshit maze of dead-end hallways.
 
* The player has to run a similar maze when a boss monster chases after them.
 
* The intro has a splash screen explaining that the game contains blood and gore
 
* Hospital gurneys showing up in random places.

And this is just a starter list. The enemies include blatant rip-offs of Leatherface, and elsewhere.

I honestly don't understand how people can get excited about this game. It is just so obnoxiously derivative.

It was Wednesday January 30
hours and then they got off. He then started his own world that he had been working on for a while. Not very long into 
playing the world a player appeared named ""dannyj98"". He had an interesting skin. It had long black hair white shirt 
and black pants with a white face.The skin was included in skin pack 3. He was slain  multiple times by my brother with an 
enchanted diamond sword. About
game. He then joined my brother's party. He had an Indian accent. He acted quite hostile towards my brother and was
now at this point greefing and looting the world. Then he left the game and the party by saying I'm deleting you. He was
not my friend nor my brother. His friends didn't even know who he was. My brother got off and walked away extremely 
confused about what just happened. We ate dinner and 2 hours later went to bed. At about 3:30 a.m I was awakened by
a loud bloody cry from the room next to mine which happened to be my brothers. I grabbed a sharp object I saw in my 
room just in case. As I walked into the room there was nobody there just my brother in his bed. I walked closer just to
see if he was okay. As I approached him I rested my hand on his bed and it was wet. I went and turned the light on and 
I was spechless at what I saw on my hand. It was blood. My hand was covered in blood. I quickly went back to the bed
and it looked like a sharp object

wouldn't let him. I would punch dannyj in the face

and got the thing twice in the head. It killed him to my relief and heavily breathing
got up and threw up in the bathroom. My mom quickly came to check on me. I told her that my brother was dead and she
started to cry. I sat down feeling depressed. I walked back out into the hallway and dannyj98 was gone. ",self,t5_2tv55,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/19jv66/dannyj98_a_gaming_creepypasta_i_wrote/

My client crashed midway through a game two days ago, I noticed that I had received an honor from that game, the ""honorable opponent"" one, to be exact. I originally thought someone DDOS'd it, but the fact that I received honor from it was weird to me. I couldn't really remember what that game was about, since it was so short, but luckily, despite it not showing up on my match history.

I played Nocturne jungle for that game, and I had a pretty standard build for about 15 minutes, which was a madred's razor, some boots, a vamp scepter and a few health pots up until the point that my client crashed.

Upon re-watching it, I saw that he simply had no name. Stranger yet, he was also a Nocturne player. From the beginning, he sat still in his base.

I might as well describe to you what happened during the game. We started out normally, with every player being in the 6-10 level range, save for the enemy Nocturne. It was at 15:13 when I used my ultimate to get what seemed to be an assured kill on the enemy Soraka. This is when the game crashed...or when I thought it crashed. My recorder thought otherwise.

In the replay, it was during this glitch that my client froze and closed on me. But in the replay, after the glitch, it showed us all still playing...this REALLY freaked me out, but I kept watching. Apparently, my ""character"" secured the kill on the Soraka, recalled and continued to jungle. That's when I read the eerie message... ""...has reconnected."" The no name jungler on the other team got back into the game somehow and started to jungle. I felt uneasy watching him.

The other lanes kept at each other, the Ezreal, and it was the enemy Nocturne who killed him. He never respawned either. I froze in my chair, watching people die, one by one, each death leaving a lasting impression on me.

The Nocturne that I was ""supposedly"" playing did everything I would have done, to the point that I was gripping my desk. I can't really explain why, but it's a nerve-racking feeling knowing that if your character died, they wouldn't come back... I kept telling myself it was a glitch, but after what happened next, I found it hard to.

There were only 3 people left. Me, a Diana. At this point, my eyes were glued to the screen, and I couldn't help but watch as my character pursued her. This was the death that disturbed me the most. My character ulted towards her, as I normally would have done, and met her at her wraith camp. Just as my character got there, I saw the enemy Nocturne standing still in the passage to their red buff...he just stood there and watched my Nocturne destroy the enemy Diana.

After her death

The minions didn't move, I checked my settings on the recording. The chat box was unchecked. I remember my fingers shaking a bit as I clicked to check it.

The no name jungler had been typing throughout the entire match after the apparent crash. All he said, ""KILL THEM ALL. KILL THEM ALL."" Up until I had killed Diana. I felt my heart sink when I read those words, decorated across my screen. What he said soon after was what sent chills throughout my entire body.

""Thank you for your assistance.""

And that's when the game ended. No nexus was destroyed, I found that none of them played another game after that one. I'm still checking every few minutes, hoping that one of them will get in a game soon. I don't really know what happened to those people, and I don't think I want to know...

I have since deleted the recording from my computer. I don't want anything to do with that replay...

The image of seeing the ""honorable opponent"" message on my screen from logging in is still burned in my head...never have I felt so undeserving.
