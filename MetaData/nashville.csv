My fiancee and I have been seriously researching what it would take to start up a geeky, 1-UP Barcade, or Snakes and Lattes.) Obviously we don't want to put a ton of time and effort into something that wouldn't appeal to Nashville geeks, so I figured I'd throw this out to Nashville's redditors for some informal polling since they probably trend more geeky than the average Nashvillian.

The basic idea is to have a place that serves food and drink; has a big collection of board games that anyone can play; hosts events such as nerd rock concerts, at least on weekends, for hardcore gaming (and because Nashville has a sorry lack of 24-hour food options); probably has some classic arcade games; and so on ad infinitum.

1341297501.0,vyuq1,PSA From your friends at the TN Forestry Division. ,Shorvok,28,3,9,"Hey everybody

Even if we get some rain unless it is a major amount we still have horribly volatile conditions for forest fires. As terrible as it is I personally recommend holding off on fireworks this year, etc.,and rockets. Especially the rockets that have little parachutes or something like that can just be that much more likely. All it takes is one little ember to start a huge fire, and rockets are bad about doing to so far away you don't notice or can't do anything until it is too late. Also fountains and stuff are probably a bad idea unless you do it in a parking lot or something, even in a street they could start the grass on the shoulder on fire.

Many areas don't have burn or firework bans

The fires we've had thus far have been rough to fight as everything burns very easily. LBL recently had some fires due to negligence  that did quite a bit of damage and were difficult to contain.


In these conditions fires can happen quick and from almost everything

A couple notes before I get going; first of all, so if I went through by myself, it's a bit harder to gauge some of the things that might set you off, so your mileage may very, and it also means I'm not so sold on sensory overload things. If strobes, darkness, and loud noises work for you, I'm from Los Angeles, and those are very light crowds)


Here we go...
.
.

.

[Monster Mountain](http://monstermountain.net/) - Hendersonville -$15 - 45 min - Fri 9/29 -3/5

This was the first one I went through, and you basically go through a bunch of different 'movie sets' as the overall theme is that you're going through a studio. This basically lets them put together a bunch of different things and have an umbrella theme. Lots of walking, including steps and tunnels and the like. All in all, I wasn't too impressed with the talent, but it was still early in the season, and the decor was extensive, lots of old cars and other large pieces.
.
.

.

[Creepy Hollow Haunted Woods](http://www.creepyhollowwoods.com/) - Spring Hill - $15 - 25 min - Sat 9/30 -3/5

The creepiest place to get to for a guy used to the suburbs, the first section is going through a barn, the second section is a haunted woods outdoors, and this one seemed to do a fairly good job of keeping things going throughout, rather than individual sections. Then, it finished up with a standard maze. There is also a hayride here that you can do for an extra $5; seems more aimed for kids, and so I didn't try it. The decor, wasn't too impressive

.

.

[Millers Thrillers](http://www.millersthrillers.net/) - Columbia - $15 - 30 min - Sat 9/30 - 4/5

Millers Thrillers is much more of an event than any other haunt. There is a $5 entry fee if you're not getting a ticket for something else since they have a stage set up with live entertainment, although half the trouble on this one, for me anyway, is just how steep the path gets at some points. The really interesting concept that they have here is that for $20 (or $30 if with the haunt), they also have a hayride where you shoot zombies (live people in costume). The trailer that you ride on has paintball guns attached to it, so that you can aim a little bit. The concept is great, and it lasts about 15 minutes, and having someone standing there as you shoot them. No sport in that. The best spots were areas where you had zombies coming at you through the brush or things like that. I'd say probably not worth the money

.

.

[Death Valley Haunted Woods](http://www.deathvalleyhauntedwoods.com/) - Hendersonville - $15 - 35 min - Fri 10/5 -3/5

Decent length, but it doesn't have that same open feeling other haunted woods do, as most of it is outside, but with very narrow walls, just not covered. The talent was not very impressive since they basically just relied on hitting something loud very near you while you were in the dark. That said, they did do a pretty good job of using darkness, and there are actually a few sections of maze to this one, although I think they're probably a little too ambitious to show people the right way out. The latter half was better and had some better settings and design. With how densely packed the paths are here

.

.

[Bloody Acres Haunted Woods](http://bloodyacres.webs.com/) - Gallatin - $15 - 30 min - Fri 10/5 - 4/5

Another Haunted Woods, and the shame of it is that some of those areas are very creepy, but there's a definite staffing problem here, and it really needs about 3 or 4 more people, as there are some patterns that show up otherwise. That said, the talent here did impress me, so while they could use more people, it's supposed to be safe.... but they manage to offset the precautions of not having chainsaws with chains by how they use them. So

.

.

[Slaughterhouse](http://www.slaughterfest.com/) - Nashville - $15 - 20 min - Sat 10/6 - 3/5

Located in a warehouse next to the convention center, had a line of about half an hour or so, and it moved very slow. The talent working the line did a pretty good job of keeping things entertaining, though. There were a couple good effects once you're inside, using doors is a nice touch to make it harder to see what's coming, for example. There is also one effect in here that I really like and won't spill because it's all about the surprise with these things. That said, I don't really think it was the top one

.

.

[Nashville Nightmare](http://nashvillenightmare.com/) - Madison - $15 - 30 min - Sun 10/7 - 5/5

Slow wait here, I knew this was going to be good because of how detailed the exterior was (this is set in a large portion of a shopping center) as well as how detailed the talent working the line was. Not only were they good, but that they've got prosthetics is a good sign because it allows them to be more expressive, to talk easier, and mess with people better. This is actually broken up into three different segments, including a morturary and an old house. The talent here was amazing, and they really knew what they're doing. The decor was amazing, this is it. Sensors set off traps, you'd never really notice them with how well decorated the place is. The cemetary there, it would be here. This is one of the best haunts I've ever been through anywhere.

.

.

[Mad House Haunt](http://www.madhousehaunt.com/) - Lebanon - $15 - 20 min - Fri 10/12 - 1/5

This one is entirely within a large warehouse, and that does somewhat kill the illusion. I'm fairly impressed with the layout, as they manage to weave you around so that you come by the same people multiple times and that makes the staffing seem higher than it was. That said, a lot of the decoration seemed a bit simple, and the talent, while trying to be fairly interactive (generally a plus) wasn't too good at it. That said, I was sent through this one with another group that included a couple kids, I wasn't impressed with this one. If you do check this out

.

.

[Dead Land Woods](http://www.deadlandwoods.com/) - Lebanon (south of) - $15/$25 - 25/25 min - Fri 10/12 - 5/5

Dead Land actually has two haunted trails, and only put me with other people on the other when I said I'd be fine with that. So group numbers are kept down. The first was The Curse, and there's actually a whole video that they have you start off watching while you're in line. The talent here was really good, and the trail follows the arc from the video for the first section, so it's very immersive in that sense. The second trail is The Portal, which was awesome. This one is themed to be entering into the world of fairy tales and nursery rhymes, and the atmosphere on this was extremely well done. It's a series of set pieces, personally

.

.

[Death Row](http://www.deathrowhauntedhouse.net/) - Nashville - $12 - 25 min - Sat 10/13 - 2/5

This one has, it seems. And the lines showed. I waited over an hour for this one. The talent working the lines were pretty good, but it almost goes downhill when you get inside. Death Row is heavily based around having you walk through strobes in a large group (I think it was over 10 people, and at least 3 different groups). Most of the stuff you see is stationary props or simple animatronics with excessive gore, and while some of the talent is good, they're also almost non-existant. Very underwhelming, personally

.

.

[Gorehouse](http://www.gorehouse.net/) - Hendersonville - $13 - 20 min - Sun 10/14 - 4/5

This is a first time haunt, and they've got a good concept developing as they repurpose a building that had been another haunt previously. This is also one that does a very good job of messing with ones expectations. I hope to see this one does well because the people behind it have some great perspective on how to make one of these well crafted and well designed. This has the potential to become even more awesome in coming years as they add some length to it.

.

.

[Devil's Dungeon](http://www.devilsdungeon.net/) - Nashville - $15 - 30 min - Sun 10/14 - 3/5

This one apparently has a lot of controversy tied to it. Whole Church of Satan thing that it starts off with, although there's a few good rooms in it. The maze, though, is very impressive, and took a good several minutes on it's own. And unlike most other mazes, this one is legitimately in near total darkness, and they are not a 'safe area', as the talent was fairly hit and miss

.

.

TL;DR Highlights:

Best Haunted Attraction: Nashville Nightmare

Best Haunted Trail: Dead Land Woods

Up and Coming: Gore House

Most Unique: Millers Trillers (for the zombie shoot hayride)

Most for Your Dollar: Nashville Nightmare or Monster Mountain

Taken from the UFCW 1995's Facebook
""The Kroger Company's Best Offer was rejected by the membership by more than 90%. We have contacted Federal Mediation to inform them and ask for the Company's earliest dates to return to the bargaining table. We will keep you informed.""

Apparently they are suppose to try mediation tomorrow

----

**Update** My roommate showed me the letter that the management is spreading to the workers.

December 6

To Our Associates :

We regret to inform you that the union has reported to us that Kroger's ""Comprehensive Best Offer"" has failed to receive sufficient votes for ratification.

We are very disappointed because our offer provided:* 

* Several wage increases and two substantial lump sums. The first wage increase and lump sum for eligible associates would have been ***effective immediately*** had the agreement been ratified

* A commitment by the company to pay all health insurance costs for eligible associates minus your co-insurance

* Stable pension benefits made possible with substantial Company investments to your Pension funds

We know you must be wondering what this means for you. Your current contract extension remains in place. You will continue to work under the terms of the existing contract. However

The company is evaluating next steps. We will keep you informed as we have new information. If you have questions

Our program is not just about competition and athleticism. Nashville Junior Roller Derby accepts girls ages 10 - 17 that are all sizes, religions, etc. It becomes a 'family' for those kids that may not have a stable family life otherwise. It also becomes a caring structured activity for those kids that have not found the right sport for them. We have seen such a difference in attitude, personality, body image, and pride from the participants in our league. Your contribution helps ensure our program continues to provide a safe and healthy place for these young ladies to flourish!

2012 was a year of 'firsts' for our league. It was our first competitive season. One of our junior refs was the first junior ref allowed to ref a sanctioned adult bout. We were the first junior roller derby bout to be broadcast via the internet. What did it get us?

We ranked 13th internationally among the junior roller derby teams and got invited to bout at the Wild West Tournament next March! 

**Why is that important?**

Our league will get the opportunity to play in a tournament that features 6 of the top ten junior teams in the world. This is a huge deal for us

**What We Need**
We need to send 15 skaters, WA from Nashville. We estimate needing $10,000 to help off-set the costs for our skaters and their families. This money will cover group airfare, hotel, transportation, and food for the league while in Bremerton.

The thing is, because if you take it out, or even turn it all the way back, the ignition is a bitch to get started. Like 30 minutes of trying to turn it sometimes. Anyways, the pic is of my model truck -just think dirtier and rustier. I'd bet that it didn't make it very far before they either ran out of gas or turned it off in a parking lot somewhere and couldn't start it again. Unless they got it to some shady salvage yard today.

Using the Find My iPhone app again

A couple minutes later, then I realized, hey this is stolen!  So you can come get it, but if you could help me out, since I just spent the last $75 I have on this phone, I'd appreciate it.""  Pondering for a moment,  I then answered, I'm bringing the cops with me, okay.  I guess I'll just leave it here with them.  But if you need me

A few hours later, he had used my iPhone to call his own number (the one he gave my wife), I'm assuming so that he could know my phone's number.  

Just outside there was a gentleman selling The Contributor, and he obviously feels this could be of some value to him.  He needs it more than I do, I should think of it as a finder's fee.  Plus, I've got no real proof, just circumstantial evidence pointing me to a not-very-smart accidental criminal.

What burns me, including the have-nots.  If he had been so inclined, I would happily have given him a $20 bill for keeping it safe, especially when I saw him selling papers.  But instead I got a bad taste in my mouth, and lost a little bit of trust in my fellow man.  

Or could I be wrong?  Am I overlooking something? Is there a possibility everything he said was true?  Does this qualify as a theft?  Am I unjustly judging this guy's character without sufficient evidence?  Am I overthinking this

My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'. We'll be in Nashville this weekend and have an open spot for Saturday

* [Breakfast with Strangers mainsite](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page - please like us](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'Nashville' in the subject line. 


**More details about our project**

On July 18, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027


**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

I have a place to stay so I'm not going to hit you up for that. I'll give you a lift or meet you there or for dinner beforehand. I smoke- just in case that's an issue for driving

* I am really bad with dates. (calendar kind) 

* I do not wish to pay for an escort (didn't think I'd ever see those messages in my inbox- thanks for the pics though)  

* I am neither a top nor a bottom. The gay community seems to be very forward. Although I think my friends are trolling me.

* Just want to grab dinner and see a show with someone who enjoys Louis.  Guy or girl does not matter. I do not have an online dating profile to send you.

Apparently there's something called ""college football"" that means we can't do many Barcrafts on Saturdays until after December. ;/ There's only one big MLG left this season anyways

It's also come to our attention that possibly the best way to do this would be to get a Vandy student or teacher to check out some sort of media room on campus for us to use. We'd have full access to TV, and since Vandy's not a dry campus: BYOB. Please speak up if you have this kind of access...

Failing that, it will be easier to set up a consistent place to have this with a room we know will hold us all. Until then, we've kinda got to take it week by week on locations...

I've set up this facebook group to start getting an idea of how many people would show up on what night of the week. I can make FB events for the MLG and any other Saturday thing we can get enough people for. The basic idea is to do a week night either weekly or bi-weekly

My suggestions

1) A complete overhaul of the FAQ page. Right now it's very utilitarian and not very user-friendly or easy to understand (case in point, call it something along the lines of ""/r/nashville suggests"" or whatever.

2) Create a poll

Anyone can Google the chamber of commerce, like so many city subbreddits do, is not sufficient.

Secondly they vowed to make things even better for their kind patrons who would offer the time and laughter as gifts to the troupe
The gifts offered by the troupe to the patrons? Bigger shows, brand new games, shows every 1st &amp; 3rd weekend of the month, a sign leading the way to where the performances were. (Sir Dan Johnson stepped in and filled the role of sign &amp; now stands daily marking the entrance to the theater)

Because they take their vows seriously they have and will be spending their days and nights living up to their vows.

I have been on all the hiring websites and its not been looking good. I still have 9 hours left for my degree so I'm not having much luck when it come to ""bachelors degree"" requirements. My degree is Broadcast(production). I would like to eventually work on a video/music set or do film editing. Honestly right now a Gofer job would make me extremely happy at a low pay. I'm starting to get frustrated and a little down because it's not been going very well. If anyone has any suggestions,False,

I've heard rumors of tunnels that link up several buildings downtown as well as leading to the Cumberland river. One spot to access is rumored to be in the basement of a building in Printers Alley. These tunnels may have been used in the civil war era or even during the prohibition years. Just wondering if anyone could shed some light on this matter and share anything you've heard about it.,t5_2qimh,True
