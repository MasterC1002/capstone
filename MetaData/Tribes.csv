ASK HI REZ TO INCLUDE THIS AS AN IN-GAME MENU OPTION. 

My basic understanding of the below fix is as follows: Essentially

By turning the OneFrameThreadLag setting to false

Please note though, this fix might make the game unplayable. If you're on a more modern  PC, you shouldn't have a noticable frame hit. 

Fix is below this line.



Go to: 

C:\Users\*YOUR PC NAME*\Documents\My Games\Tribes Ascend\TribesGame\Config

Open:

Tribes.ini

Insert under DirectionalLightMaps=True the following:

""OneFrameThreadLag=False"" (without "" marks)

Save the ini.

Enjoy drastically increased mouse responsiveness.

1339614175.0,v09pz,A warning to anyone who is good at this game.,shrimpfan6350,572,139,429,"Hi-Rez will ban you for cheating if enough people report you

The first time was on Sunday morning a few weeks ago. I was booted out of a game and got a ban message at the login screen. Support told me:

&gt; Your account was in violation of section 3f of the EULA for using cheats, mods or any unauthorized third-party technology, software, tools or content designed to modify the Software Product, the Service or Site. After additional review of the evidence, we stand by the ban. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.

I don't cheat. I checked with a few other people I play with who aren't banned and there's nothing unusual running on my system that nobody else has. The only unique thing in my case is that I can't play the game without being reported dozens of times a day by people who presumably have never played an FPS before.

I offered to send videos of me playing along with any information about my system in case there was something setting off a false flag, and after 3 days I was unbanned. No apology, no explanation, and no compensation for lost time.

This past Sunday morning I was booted out of a game again and met with another ban message. Same thing, and they deactivated my forum account when I tried to contact an admin. I gave support one last try and sent them several videos of TDM rounds I had recorded over the past month, plus a list and description of every process running on my system when I play. They ignored everything and gave me the exact same automated response from the first time I was banned. I haven't gotten any word from them since.

Here are some of the videos I sent: [1](http://youtu.be/gejDjbFRb_8), [4](http://youtu.be/88Znuqnh08Y)

Update: Hi-Rez insists that they don't ban solely based on player reports and human review all bans. It seems they actually thought I was cheating, with my last support ticket sitting at ""researching"" for weeks.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,1341674012.0,,

* no *back* button

* add icons for turrets and sensors next to the generator icon
* own team is always blue
* when there is a vote to kick someone there's a prompt that says F5 = No; F6 = Yes
* time left on team selection is always 10:35
* there's no indication (neither visual nor audio) how long it takes for claymores to be primed (it's about 2 seconds); and while we're at it
* icons for *call ins* (tactital
* in spectator mode

* Kill details cover up VGS http://i.imgur.com/IM6SP.jpg
* UI elements cover up the flag marker http://i.imgur.com/DbFOg.jpg

Training - Target Practice

* Most bots have the symbol for heavy armor

General

The UI looks like it was made for a console. The class edit could greatly benefit from a UI where you can edit your loadout of a class in just one page.

I did PM HiRezTodd and make him aware of the amount of people affected by this per the reddit thread. Stuff is going to be looked into. Todd noted that things might have gotten stuck somewhere inbetween HiRez and the tournament organizers themselves. So for now I'm going to have faith that stuff will get taken care of in a relatively expedient manner.  Thanks for the support everyone on the thread :]

--------------------------------------

ORIGINAL POST: 


Despite repeatedly assurances from Bart *weeks* ago that money for these events would be coming ""soon"", he suddenly becomes unavailable. 

So I am now making this post in an effort to push this to the top of Bart's priority list so that this can be taken care of in an expedient manner. Please throw your support behind this thread if you can - it's ridiculous that with the money Hi Rez has made off tribes

Thanks in advance :) 

EDIT: Though I can't 100% confirm

Edit #2 so people are more clear: Between ESL, 16,000 in total has not been paid (spread out among the competitive players who won their share of that of course.) 3,500 ESL, 2,500 FPSGeneral, 10

EDIT #3: Just so people have an idea in regards to the failure in execution on HiRez's part that goes beyond any real financial concerns. Many of the tournaments listed above *also* had Tribes Gold rewards that were never delivered. Rewards that should take zero processing time on the part of Hi Rez.

I play chaser a lot and can often just time a nitron to make the capper drop our flag the second he touches it.  This means the flag is often sitting right next to the base in perfect position to get knocked somewhere weird and be easily defended.  This applies x1000 when the flag is off the stand and in the ship on crossfire.  Stick it in a corner and it will be almost impossible to take until it returns automatically.

This the biggest, buzz, event to date. I promise I will leave it all on the caster desk for you. I'll continue to give every moment I have to this franchise that is more precious to me than any other.

My Tribes account was wrongfully banned on 4/17/2013.
     
     
On the same day, and what “evidence” was used against me. It turned out that HiRezAPC had spectated me for about two minutes and determined that I was using a hotkey to toggle my camera view between enemy players

1335979761.0,t3k58,My thoughts on HoFing with stand illustrations,opieself,248,27,168,"Awhile back someone came up with the idea to post pictures of the stands for us fellow fatty flag sitters so we could compare notes and what have you so I have done that.  As a bonus I will force you to read my thoughts on HoFing (you lucky guys and gals).


**For New HoFers**

Welcome to the joy of watching paint dry!

In all seriousness your first several games being Heavy on Flag (HoF) will probably be very boring and frustrating. That is normal and expected.  Unlike most of the roles in T:A yours is very dependent on the rest of your team especially your defense doing their jobs.  You will not win the game that is what the cappers do

In terms of what you need to HoF there are three unlocks you need to get:

1. Dombringer
2. Super Heavy
3. Mines

In that order

The rules of the HoF that you must live by:

1.  You and that flag are now BFFs.  Never leave the flag.  Never chase a flag carrier or try to take out that one really annoying raider.  You will lose the flag.
2. Please refer to rule #1  That is your job plain and simple.  It is neither fast nor glamorous but it is what you do.

Now go look up some videos on how to HoF.  There are some great guides out there watch them and learn what works for you and what doesn't.  Relax have fun and enjoy waching your body get blow across the stand on drydock.

**Gameplay Hints**

Once you see a capper coming in take a few steps back from the flag.  This will let you adjust for their approach a little bt more.  And protect you from the knock back they are going to try and put on you.  (Added detail to balmung135's post)

Another [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t3k58/my_thoughts_on_hofing_with_stand_illustrations/c4jacke) by balmung135 as to what to do while idle. (TIL it is not knitting)

The saber is not very good but on some maps can be used to spot incoming cappers (That my idea yo)



**Notes on equipment**

* Forcefields (FF) are there to direct traffic not protect you or kill all the cappers.  Hymnosi has some great points on forcefield usage in his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t3k58/my_thoughts_on_hofing_with_stand_illustrations/c4j9upo) on how to better use the Forcefield.  The key takeaway is that FFs are not to be relied upon as your main defensive mechanic.

* Chaingun is generally considered the best.  Lordsovot has made some great points in his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t3k58/my_thoughts_on_hofing_with_stand_illustrations/c4j9zfv) towards the use of the HeavyBolt Launcher (HBL) which merit further investigation.

* Mine all the routes.  Nothing feels as good as being killed respawning and hearing the sting of announcements and the kill notification of a capper being killed by your mines.

**Stand illustrations**
Sorry for the poor quality of the pics it was the best I could do.

Arx Novena 

Map Notes:
Overall a well designed stand with a range of cppaing routes.  As a HoF you can learn to mitigate them through use of shields and mines making it more about the skill of the cappers vs. the skill of the HoF in terms of who will get the flag.  Midfield Mortar spam can be annoying but is not that big of an issue on this map. 

[Arx Top down view](http://i.imgur.com/SfgzT.jpg)
This was actually borrowed from another HoFers image and has worked really well for me.  I will see if I can track down his link and give him proper credit.  Front to back and Back to Front routes are by far the most common in PUGs placing the mines on the roof tiles has been very effective at finishing off or severely crippling a capper.  The field helps heard cappers towards certain approaches cutting down your areas to cover. **There is a mine on the left roof tile section as well I apparently did not label**

[Arx Tunnel](http://i.imgur.com/ZUYgZ.jpg)  If you have the time drop a mine at the moth of each tunnel next to the little lip offered by the door frame.  Truthfully this has killed more stand harassers than cappers in my games which makes it a god send.  A force field in the tunnel really discourages the side to side.


Crossfire

Map Notes:
It's close proximity to the generator mean you will be taking heat from the get go.  4 primary path directions makes it pretty easy to predict Capper routes.  The small area of the stand does make it a trick for keeping up your defensive equipment with the near constant shelling and harassment.  Mortar spam from near your ship is very common and makes life pretty crappy with no help.

[Crossfire Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/L8aT8.jpg)
Thanks to the ship side to side routes are the most common

[Crossfire Isometric](http://i.imgur.com/5B3fI.jpg) I like to place a mine just inside the door as well as a shield inside this more or less stops the front to back and back to front routes as well as providing a small amount of protection from the constant stand haters.


Dry Dock

Map Notes:
Learn to love the respawn timer screen.  The proximity to base entrances as well as the 3 seperate high ground Mortar spam stand surrounding your base means you will be dead far more than you will be alive.  The open flag stand provides for a massive number of routes making your job even harder.  I hate this map.

[Dry Dock Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/B0YiW.jpg)
Don't set any of your defenses near the flag; it will just get blown up faster than you can reset it.  Instead place your mines on the exit direction of the routes the enemy cappers are using.


Katabatic

Map Notes:
Mortar spam friendly this map is another unpleasant one to be HoF especially if you have no help on non gen defense.  The routes are pretty easy to pick up from a distance and you can adapt your mines and shields as you see fit.

[Katabatic Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/l6reX.jpg)  Use the force field to mitigate the easier routs as well as heard the cappers on to your mines.  You may consider putting a mine on the ramp and a second field if you have time in side the building up the ramp to discourage the side to side routes.


Raindance

Map Notes:  With only side to side routes available this map is deceptively easy to defend.  Mortar spam from the hill to your right will be a constant cause of grief.  The small size of the stand also makes it very easy for cappers to remove your defenses.

[Raindance Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/nKnhf.jpg) Spread your mines out and use the force field to cover the side coming from your base.  There is a harder to hit route that hugs the side of the tower and mitigates most mine placements so use your field to stop that shit.  The only nice thing to say about this stand is it is pretty easy to get out of the call-in strike attacks by  stepping in the building quickly and stepping back out.


Sunstar

Map Notes:  If the gen is up this is a HoFers dream

[Sunstar Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/nFVQF.jpg) I killed the gen to make it more clear


Temple Ruins

Map Notes: A lot of people hate it

[Temple Ruins Top Down](http://i.imgur.com/2jA1D.jpg)  Mine placement is still a work in progress but I use the columns to try and protect them as much as I can.  Field placement will vary game to game

As I've seen today a guy was banned because of it here

Have to say I didn't publish on Smite Reddit because mods applies some kind of strong Censorship against bad feedback to Hi-Rez

This was originally made for Smite users

---
First of all
---

I have contacted and noticed about this to:

1. Todd Harris
2. Support
3. Some Hi-Rez Workers

I had an answer from Todd Harris

---
Summary
---

The Tribes/Smite/GA EULA states Hi-Rez has the right to monitor for blacklist software while the game is open. Evidence has shown that Hi-Rez monitors your computer for blacklist software even when Tribes/Smite/GA is closed

---
**If you want more information

---
Evidence
---

Video: https://vimeo.com/70404546

Video Summary: This video shows that running blacklist software while Smite is closed will ban your IP address from the Tribes/Smite/GA servers.

Steps from the video: http://pastebin.com/BCFYgcgW

Tip: Video was made when i knew almost nothing about this process, didn't repeat it because I had to ""suicide"" 2 IPs to make the video.

---
More Info
---

After some investigation

    HiPatchService auto starts when your computer boots and scans for blacklisted software until you shut it down.
    All this process info is hidden and they don't allow us to stop it from launcher.
    The process says ""In pause"" on the process list when you're out of Tribes/Smite/GA
    It keeps using memory

---
From the Tribes/Smite/GA EULA
---

**Consent to Monitor. WHEN RUNNING**, THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT MAY MONITOR YOUR COMPUTER’S RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) **FOR UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY WITH THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT**. AN “UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM” AS USED HEREIN SHALL BE DEFINED AS ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE PROHIBITED BY SECTION 2. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT DETECTS AN UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM, THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT MAY COMMUNICATE INFORMATION BACK TO HI-REZ, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR ACCOUNT NAME, DETAILS ABOUT THE UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM DETECTED, AND THE TIME AND DATE; AND HI-REZ MAY EXERCISE ANY OR ALL OF ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION

---
Conclusion
---

Be careful of what programs you chose to run on your computer if you have Hi-Rez games installed. It may trigger a ban of your IP address and accounts associated with that IP.

Also, and the account/IP should be unbaned.

Spread the word.

We will be releasing funds for the Summer of Tribes events this week!
Basically

The same people that are processing payment are directly involved in game and event operations. Believe it or not

Many of you have reached out to me for information about payment processing and unfortunately I did not have a concrete answer to give.

Some of the money has been paid out already by the time of this post to the various organizations. I can confirm payment this week for outstanding ESL
Now on to gold. Basically the same deal when it comes to being busy and multitasking this among other things

Gold will flow from my internet browser today/this week.

Team captains : Please keep a look out for emails/irc pms regarding your rosters! The gold will either come as a list of codes or directly added to the player's accounts in question!

You cannot leave this man alone.

HoF is one of the most torturous, and remove our static defenses in one. Even pathfinders can simply spam at us from what is essentially an unreachable distance for even the few of us who choose to use a bolt launcher. Strikes can remove us at a moment's notice, while kamikaze brutes and raiders essentially clear the flag stand for up to 30 seconds - more than enough for cappers to slip by.

The point is - We. Are. Limited. We are not your one stop shop for flag defense

What we NEED to be effective is people in mid. Applying pressure, killing off strike targeters before they can finish the lock on, and destroying jugs who try to spam.

All it takes is one or two considerate people to ensure that a flag will never leave your stand. Please,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,BE,t3_s1xq0

* The Phase Rifle’s downscope reticule has been tweaked and crosshairs added.
* Raindance: A new route has been added into the generator room.

**Additional Items**

* With the help of community feedback
* Bouncing off a rock at an extreme angle is possible again
* The “grace angle” for a bounce that loses no speed has been widened
* We will continue to adjust this feature as needed.
* FIxed an issue where some Accolades were not being awarded with some of the new variant weapons.
* Fixed an issue where the Determination Perk was not applying its health boost correctly.
* Fixed a situation where XP was not being given if the player had left the match early.

I never played a multiplayer online only game before. Usually just the AAA titles, I have found myself coming back over and over again, usually not even starting or finishing other games.

Sad

Now

As of now, seriously. This is getting to be too much. 

At the beginning of the year

From what we have been told, optimization, content, who knows? It's a secret, we know. 

I just don't understand

It has all the capabilities of being the world's greatest game (I don't care what others may say concerning past titles in the series). I played the others, quite a bit of Heat for that comment). But, it's my opinion. 

I thought you HiRez, adding content (maps, skins, Voice packs, etc...). So, what happened? Why has such a Grand Title (Franchise), taken the back burner? (I know about Smite

After all the praise that T:A has received

We have seen the videos of you HiRez, hit-it and quit-it sort of brand for you. But, that doesn't seem to be the case. At least at this point.

I do apologize for writing this, Customization options (Skins, Colors for Jet Trails, Weapons, Discs, Armors), Armor variants

But yet

To be honest

At least One map per month, that's on the low end. 

It should be one map per month of each game type (two (2) for CTF). Plus two or more skins (customization options). After all, keeping players interested. Unlocks at different levels, Armor variants once hit certain levels (Achievements). Colors, showing you are High Level (skins for weapons, Armor). Like every other Free-2-Play title. 

They make money for a reason. Cause they get back what they put in

I love this game, I will play.

Just re-think your strategy

Please get back on track with your Transparency Model. Launch the Public Test Servers for us to give feedback on what Kate and anyone else has been working on. Dedicate a small team, than what we have been seeing.

So I downloaded it and fired it up. It took a while....but after a couple hours I found myself having more fun than I'd had in a video game in probably 10 years. I finally had something to look forward to when I came home at night (luckily I had found a new job about two weeks after I was laid off). I would literally spend time daydreaming about flying around in the Tribes universe. I finally had something to be passionate about. 

TLDR: It would not be a stretch of the imagination to say that Tribes Ascend saved my life. Is this story a bit pathetic? Yeah....I suppose it is. But I figured I'd share anyway.

There are a number of things in the next patch, giving people more options to find weapons that fit their exact preferred playstyle. And there are a couple new maps.

Perhaps the biggest change

With the next patch, perk, and armor class will progress automatically towards their upgrades as you play with them equipped.

This is greatly to your advantage

Think of it as each item having their own little progression bar, so it is increased by performance, boosting, first win of the day, and badge earning.

Some important things to consider:

- Any upgrades you have purchased prior to the upgrade will remain purchased.

*EDITED
- When the patch is live, there will be an option to immediately master the weapon at any point using XP.
/EDITED*

- When the patch is live

If there are upgrades you wish to have immediately unlocked, though, that you may wish to save all of your XP now with the knowledge that future unlocks will happen automatically on the weapons you wish to play with.

We are excited about this change and are excited to hear your feedback and concerns.

HiRezStew: Edited original post. We'll add a single button to master the weapon using XP.

The concern of having this has mostly been just around causing confusion for new users. The new system is nice in its simplicity in that you simply play the weapon and you earn upgrades

This has probably been posted before

One of the best things that Tribes had for it in previous titles

The time we spend here is valuable to us. We want to have fun and have a great time. And in the time we spend here and play the game, and occasionally those ideas create inspiration. It is in that inspiration that brings me to the topic of this post.

The community has MANY good/great/downright terrible ideas for mapping. I often read posts or hear people talk about ""the flags need to be indoors"" or ""No, tanks on bridges, and yes, the Havok [oh where are thou?]) to move around the map. You could still jetpack platform to platform, but if you fell off, you died when you hit the ground. These maps wouldn't have been possible without the creativity and inspiration from the community. And these servers were ALWAYS full. Why? Because the maps were fun to play on. And the server admins knew this, so they had popular maps in rotation.

So

Now comes the slightly harder part of implementation. Yes, similar to how starcraft 2 maps are released (http://www.starcraft2maps.net/ for example) and then allow private or custom servers to download/upload maps to their servers. Security could possibly be a concern, but I am sure there are ways around that. Another option would be to have some sort of a review process where maps are uploaded directly to Hi-Rez where they can then implement the maps that they find ""acceptable"" but this could lead to a large amount of maps that will get thrown out for whatever reason and never heard from again. I think the former option is more ideal, but I will let the community decide.

I know you will have concerns that this will make your maps obsolete or inferior in some way or another. But you can still make your maps as you see fit, there are plenty of ways to do this. Hi-Rez can even look at which maps are popular and get an idea of WHY these maps are popular. It is a win-win as it will give the community what they want, and valuable data Hi-Rez can use in future map design.

Basically it comes down to this

The huge list of little improvements which could make the game so much better.

Well it's been a while since we had one of these threads, well...  See for yourself.  This is all my OPINION, so you might think differently and are welcome to tell me why I am wrong about things.  I might add your suggestions to this so it's all in one place.

**Tiny improvements - probably only need to alter one variable or something.**

* More Loadout slots.  Hell, if they want cash...

* Allow us to use the mouse wheel for menus.  This is 2013

* Vehicle selection hotkeys.  1, shrike, beowulf.  Or make it ascending price order, as in grav on top, shrike on bottom so that 1 is always gravcycle, 2 is always beowulf, and 3 is shrike for lights/mediums.

* Allow us to mute peoples VGS spam

* Let us COMPLETELY mute people

* Re-work the ridiculously bad mute, like we have for people in our friendslist.

* Lower the threshold required for a successful votekick.  And make it so that everyone who doesn't vote

* No respawn timer for roaming map gamemode.

* Bigger indicator of where the flag is when someone grabs.  Not some little icon that goes BEHIND all my HUD stuff.

* Remove the health upgrades for each armour.  This just puts new players at even more of a disadvantage against current players

* Save our server browser settings.  Favorites are nice



**Small improvements - Stuff that should have been done

* A different loading screen for each map.

* Custom crosshair support.

* Fix the spectator thing to show proper weapons

* A ping-delay for the target practice mode.  Would make it actually relevant.  Note that this would be a number you put into your machine to delay each shot

* separate the VGS spam from the chat text.

* Fix third person mode

* 100% inheritance weapon variants for other classes

* Skins!  Shit that you can monetize which has no effect on gameplay!  Vehicle skins!  CAAAAAAPES!!!  The ones we have now are a good start, you do the math)  Or have custom parts for each class...




**Larger Improvements - Stuff that should have been done**

* Directional Jets.  In addition

* Actual diminishing returns on jet-pack use, 72-100 = 8 m/s^2 , 100-125 = 6 m/s^2 ...

* Ability to choose where you spawn, Kata, almost every other map...)

* The chat system.  Why the FUCK DOES IT STILL LOOK LIKE A CONSOLE?  That shit should have been developed during early beta

* Decent, skiing, impulse jumps, FLAG PLAY, and the actual uses and roles of assets and classes.

* Medium class hitbox size.  Shouldn't they be somewhere in between light and heavy classes?

* Stonehenge.


**Bugs**

* Shrike invincibility - some shots do no damage to shrikes.

* Ping display updates in realtime.

* Server lag

* Classes display the correct skins.  No more sentinel-looking guys running around with titans.

* Getting hit by a pistol shot can interrupt you jump+jet

* Player stats.  Still broken.

* Why does it break when patches are released, multiple times even.

* Edit: Just saw another one:  When you log in the menu displays the ""Videos"" section titles on each button

* Edit: Fix the flag getting stuck in the other teams booster on blueshift.

* Edit: Fix the crash after disconnection bug.  I only wanted to text my friends

* /u/badvvolf : Fractal grenades sometimes deal far more damage than they should.  EDIT:  Apparently this is what is supposed to happen.  They explode violently on their last beam.

* /u/virtblue : Fix the bug when pressing mouse 1 and two at the same time

* /u/kurukururin : Game crashes if you change the description name of your custom server

**Wishlist - Stuff that I want to happen**

* Demo support.

* Community modding.

* Ability for players to make their own maps

* Some kind of serious or ranked games

* PLEASE make use of hotfixes more often.  Most of us can live with small bugs for a few days

* Re-work the behaviour of vehicles.  No gimble-lock on shrikes, instead of just deadstopping if you hit a too-steep slope

* Standardised inheritance and speeds for explosive weapons.  Why does the heavy bolt launcher have a slightly lower speed?  It's not different enough to easily tell that it is slower, one has 50% and one has 20% which makes it a pain in the arse to learn.  It would be nice to see some stats for inheritance and projectile speed un der the current range, damage, and ammo stats.

* Vehicle customization.  Stuff like a light-shrike with less health and more speed.  Or a tank that shoots twice as fast but does half the splash damage/radius.  Or a weapon that takes charge time but is hitscan for either vehicle.  Make them viable for offense instead of a support role in defense.  Energy-powered shileds

* Remove saber launchers.  For ""the worlds fastest shooter"" this gun seems a little out of place.  It also sets a bad example for new players in that they think sabers are the best way to kill tanks/shrikes.  And the fact that the lock-on range is way too long makes spotting and annoying cappers far too easy.

* Make repair tools heal on a health per second basis, that team can d-stack for the whole game because it takes almost no time to repair all the base assets.  A MK-4 asset with one tech can out-repair the normal brute spinfusor...

**Other Suggestions**

* /u/jojotmagnificent : OPTIMIZATION.

* /u/evanvolm : UI for muting and kicking players

* /u/Nark51 : No generator auto-repair in roaming gamemodes.

* /u/char1661 : More intelligent bots in target practice running more player-like routes.  Adding to this

* /u/Pataclocked : Size of the flag icon above a player is proportional to their distance from you.

* /u/VirTW : Havoc.

* /u/BadVVolf : Filter servers out which have a level limit that you can't enter.

* /u/tavarner17 : Create class-specific spawn points to change how effective each class can be for certain roles.  Snipers start in valleys/places with little line-of-sight

* /u/RoSoDude : General UI

* /u/blakey 88 : Option to turn off deployable names or reduce their size.  And an option to vote on the map.

* /u/EpsiIonAlpha : Have a slight cooldown on the vehicle entry button so you aren't immediately ejected while spamming it.

* /u/kurukururin : Add a parameter to the custom servers where you can change the time it takes for a player to get kicked for being afk.

* /u/bookreportgrid : The ability to record a route in practice mode

* /u/shackleshackleton : Add a custom inheritance slider for weapons.

* /u/Venz_venZ : After a map the chat should be visible somewhere

* /u/tastyham : Add an option to turn off flag drag in training mode.

* /u/tastyham : Physics preset selection for training modes.

* /u/tastyham : Active game clock in training mode.

* /u/chineseimmigrants : More weapon icons in the kill feed.  A knife kill could use a ninja star icon instead of a bullet.  Also show blue plates and air mails.

* /u/therealcreamcheesus : LAN ability.

* /u/Altairi : Distance indicators for both flags at all times

* /u/Altairi : Show own flag carrier's health at all times.

* /u/Altairi : Highlight players using VGS

* /u/Altairi : Targeting laser.

* /u/blasharga : More customizable settings in menu instead of having us edit the .ini file.

* /u/PUSH_THE_BUTTONS : Player death when snapped to a player in spectator needs to trigger a new free-look state.

* /u/PUSH_THE_BUTTONS : The flag camera will follow the flag back to the stand it came from in the event of a capture. This was ""fixed"" a long time ago but it never fixed the flag camera. The fix only works when you snap to a player from free-look, it changes based on the map.

* **Fix the lag issues** seems to be a pretty vital one

* /u/PowerTattie Fix the impulse bugs

* /u/shreq : 

* Hideable weapon model

* Customizable crosshairs per weapon or weapon group (hitscan, thumpers/bolts/GL, mortars, snipers)

* full bright mode for people with dynamic lights off

* brightness/gamma/contrast settings

* option for round timer to count up rather than down

* flag distance OSD

* remove gray translucent oval from sniper crosshair

* option to disable OSD icons and text for deployables and base assets

* reintroduce ""stat net"" console command so people can see packetloss

* tickrate option for private/passworded servers

* hold-to-fire on all weapons

* different and distinctive sounds for flag events (pick-up

* /u/ihatethissite : Hiding ""Full servers"" also hides over-capacity servers.

* /u/Schottingham : Health kits instead of passive regen

1339708797.0,v2bn4,"Hi-Rez and their ""Guilty by Association"" IP bans...",Tokyo1985,221,67,175,"On May 27th, I contacted Hi-Rez Studios' support team to inquire about their reasoning. In my support ticket I made it clear that there is an additional person/account that accesses Tribes:Ascend from the same IP address. The following day I received a response simply asking ""What would their account name be?"" (referring to the other player's account). After informing them of the other account's name I was told that they would see what they could do. I was later confronted by the other account holder who informed me that they had broken Hi-Rez's terms. Clearly the reasoning for my ban was because a completely separate account holder broke the terms of agreement.

On May 30th, I found this both infuriating and insulting. Guilty by association!? It's hard to believe that an online gaming company won't/can't differentiate between a guilty and innocent party. Being separate accounts, registered at different emails, having made separate purchases they SHOULD be treated as separate entities. How is it ethical that my account be held responsible for an unconnected party's actions? A party who's account I have no control over. Simply checking the log-in dates would show that my account had not even logged in on the ban date. This easily proves that my account is not the guilty party. Checking match history would also prove that the accounts are owned by separate entities. The two accounts have accessed the game at the same time on multiple occasions in both the same match as well as separate matches. These accounts both have considerably high ranks, far too high for one person to obtain individually. In addition to all of this, an email was sent from the abuser to Hi-Rez verifying that he was the guilty party/account.

Looking through HiRez Studios' Terms of Service, I would like restitution or an unbanning of my account. I DID NOT accept the terms of service for the abuser's account, and SHOULD NOT be bound to the punishment of breaking them. 

Hi-Rez Studio needs to realize that there is an innocent customer at stake who has spent money and time in game. It is unethical and irresponsible for a business to assume all accounts that have accessed their servers through the same IP are breaking terms because one has. Especially when there are ways to determine who was in-game at the time of the offense.

It is now June 14th

I miss my MIRV launcher!

What I'm asking from you guys is to consolidate a list of what you think are the most important bugs that need to be fixed.

The way I want to approach this idea is to start with this thread and get everyone's take on what they feel are the most important bug fixes. From there

Let me mention that we may not be able to fix the whole list of top 5/10/20/__. We'll have to delegate which ones we can do and which bugs aren't as feasible. Help me help you guys by helping me brainstorm a list of the top bugs to help carry on not only the competitive side of Tribes

Thanks for all the support in the past and the passion you carry forward to this day. We still have much love for our community and the Tribes franchise itself.

I hope you all were able to watch Behind the Blueplate today as we did talk about some great stuff. If you didn't then shame on you. You still have a chance to get the full VOD at http://www.twitch.tv/behindtheblueplate/b/335919845

Anyways



1) Pub Nights - We plan to have designated times during the weeks of November to play pubs with your favorite streamers as it gets streamed on their channel. This will help by allowing players have a more organized way to play public games without that annoying llama grabber getting in your way. Being on the mumble server is not required but it is recommended. It will also vary in game types as we seem to always play CTF each and every day. We're going to change it up with some Rabbit


2) Beginner Workshops - This is planned to be a 2 night a week event. It will vary from improving movement and combat skills to learning roles from a beginners stand point to an experts. This will help players to understand the game more and also bring everyone together. Anyone interested in volunteering


3) Pickups - Yes we have pickups going on nearly everyday (see www.playapug.com) but this will be more involved as we will help new players getting coached by top players. We will make it so players will be playing against others in their own skill bracket. They will also be streamed so you can watch yourself play later on if you will! Pickups are a great way to get a different taste of tribes if you haven't done so already. Please give them a shot if you haven't done so already.



We have plenty more events planned in the near future but we are working out the details the next couple of days. So be sure to stay tuned to the next Behind the Blueplate as Jim Christ will be featured to tell you what more we have planned. I'll give you a hint - prizes and epic games are expected ;)

One last thing - and this is very important to us and you. Join the steam community group as you will see we will put all of the events there in an organized fashion so it is easy to follow everything going on: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/natribes. You will see we already have some pub nights planned at the end of the month with your favorite streamers so make sure to keep note! There is also a twitter account that will announce everything if you're into the twitter scene: @natribes.

That is all for now but certainly not the end of it. Please contact me with any questions or suggestions. This is a COMMUNITY effort so any and everyone is welcome to get involved. The more the better! Cheers &lt;3

1339947733.0,v6igl,I think first person bullet weapon projectiles are only client-side and do not actually represent where your bullets are going...can anyone confirm? Serious implications for high pingers. (warning: long but thorough),thepulloutmethod,171,38,54,"For the past couple of months I've been living in an area with horrible internet connection. I went from having a typical ping of 30-45ms to 200-250ms. I still manage to play decently using projectile weapons like the disk launcher and the mortar

I think I've figured out why: unlike the ""elegant"" projectile weapons (fusor, the bullet projectiles you see when you fire an automatic are not actually representative of where those projectiles are traveling in-game. 

For example, and then a moment later the disc will shoot out. However, that disc you fired will behave like any normal disc after its been launched and exists in the game world as a true entity. 

This is not true with automatics. Even under pings as high as 500ms, those bullets you see are **NOT REAL**. They exist strictly on your screen (client-side), but the server registers them as being somewhere else, suffering from the same lag as your spinfusor discs. 

There is a simple way to demonstrate this even if you have a great ping. Join a game (note: this can not be demonstrated in training mode). Pick any loadout with an elegant projectile weapon and an automatic

Now fire your mortar. Your mortar will launch  in the direction your character is facing, not your actual character.

Now switch to your X1 and fire. You will notice that **your bullet projectiles will come out of your weapon at whatever angle you are facing your third person camera, the bullets will appear to come out of the machine gun at a 90 degree angle from the barrel of the weapon. 

These bullets are not ""real"". If you switch back to first person mode

What are some of the implications of this? 
Well, no amount of practice in ""training mode"" will help a high ping user because training mode operates under zero-lag conditions. In training mode, the bullets you see on your screen are true representations of where you are firing. This is no help for users who need to learn how to compensate for high ping. 

It has not escaped my attention that this may be the reason why HiRez has designed the hitboxes on bullet projectiles to be so large. A user with a middle-of-the-road ping can still be effective with automatics because although he suffers from the same false visual feedback

How can this be fixed to make automatics fair for high ping users? 
Simple, so that the visual feedback on the screen actually represents where the bullets exist in the game world. This way users can adjust their aim based on the path their bullets are traveling. For example, I'm still decent with spinfusors even at 250 ping because my brain has compensated for that slight pause between the time my weapon fires and the disc is actually appears on my screen. The automatics are impossible to compensate for because we can't see where our bullets are going and the visual feedback we are receiving is false. 

I have tested this on almost all the automatics in the game with the same results. Hit scan weapons suffer from the same problem

I realize that footage demonstrating this fact would be extremely useful

1. As shown in the screenshot edit
2. Mines do a maximum of 700 damage even when stacked directly next to each other but have a higher impulse (force which pushes a player away)
3. Mines set off other mines through your forcefield
4.  Safety Third does not increase the range of your mine explosion or the trip point.  Again
5. Mines always do the same amount of damage at all range
6. The explosion radius seems to be double the trigger radius
7. I don't have the ability to test if the trigger range is a dome shape or a cylinder shape.  If its the former

3. Also, etc, interactive assets, I think). You can find it here:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17736620/TribesGame.rar

4. Put the folder 'TribesGame' that is inside the .rar into (for example) C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\Development\Src\.

5. Go to (for example) C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\UDKGame\Config\ and open UDKEngine.ini

6. Close &amp; Save.

7. Launch the UDK Editor, make something and then display a message with the SUCCESS word. Then CLOSE it.

8. Re-Open UDK Editor. Now if you're familiar with the Editor you will know what to do

Anyway, I stood atop a fairly high hill to try and call it down on two or three player icons I'd seen. Unfortunately I'm a complete noob and didn't know the map, I'd actually been seeing the icons through a wall. They were still on the other side.

I decided to call it down anyway, who were in hot pursuit. He was heading straight for me. I basically just stood there holding LMB pointing right at those treacherous motherfuckin' Sworders, but I was really pissed cause I thought I'd die before I got to see what the call-down did. Not quite... Instead, I died right after the circle thing filled up. I was pretty happy cause I was gonna get to see what the call down does.

Turns out it was an orbital strike. It fell as every single enemy in the chase (a total of four) passed over my dead body. Every last one of them died. I spent like ten seconds just screaming at my screen after that. It felt like one of those videos you see of people tossing grenades across the map and getting triple kills. Except for me, as the last bullets entered my body. And not a single one of them got out alive, as our flagbearer triumphantly skiied away from the ashes of their bodies and the immortalized corpse of my martyr avatar.

1330608852.0,qcvu8,Tribes Ascend needs to get rid of victory-based Experience.,Route108,180,68,114,"**How it currently works:**

[According to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/q3rfm/calculating_xp/) (which seems to be correct, your Performance Bonus is a combination of 2 things: Your position on the scoreboard, and if your team wins.

**Why this is bad:**

1. It promotes teamstacking. With the XP given to the winning team far outstripping the losing team's Performance Bonus, it is beneficial to teamswitch to the winning team. Likewise, if you join a game in progress, there is an incentive to join the winning team.

2. It makes losses more frustrating. The sting of defeat should be enough. This will be especially true once profiles and stat tracking is introduced.

**What getting rid of it would do:**

1. Promote balanced teams. If there are 2 players that are substantially better than the rest of the match, they would both be securing 1st place and therefore netting more experience for themselves. Likewise, if you join the game in progress, you would want to go to the team with less credits (usually the losing team), as it would be easier for you to get to a higher position on the team.

2. Get rid of most bad manners which revolves around keeping matches going. With victory being the deciding variable for xp gain, holding onto the flag for longer would decrease your credit gain (by lowering your position on the scoreboard), giving incentive to cap the flag quickly and end stacked matches.

**What it wouldn't fix:**

1. Bad behavior for scoreboard ranking. Some needed roles (flag capping, making positions more coveted for farming XP. Likewise, bad behavior (returning the flag immediately all the time, only saving for Orbitals...) is still promoted since it gives you credits.

2. If you are not performing well

3. The fact that Temple Ruins exists in the map rotation.

**What else could fix it:**

1. Any kind of matchmaking in which you do not get to choose your team. Even though matchmaking is planned (or else Ranked is going to be a joke)

2. Making the victory XP far less significant

3. Team stacking for people who longer need or value experience. Honestly I don't think there is a way to fix this though before matchmaking is in place.",self,t5_2rdsl,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/qcvu8/tribes_ascend_needs_to_get_rid_of_victorybased/

Tribes has a long running fanbase, you are just a link in the chain of developers juggling the title. How long till the next developer picks up the IP from you? At least plan ahead and give them the benefit that they don't have to pick up all the pieces spread across multiple social media platforms. It would be a daunting task for the future holders, and I think their first announcement should be to point all of the followers back to a SINGLE interactive point of communication.

PAX was a blast, and just the right amount of hard work. It was fun hanging out with Bart, APC, remiCs, my Twitch co-workers and various eSports superstars. Plus, when Seattle is sunny it is an awesome &amp; beautiful city.

But that's not what I'm posting here to talk about. Today, about the current state of Tribes and it's diverse community.

**Part 1: History**

As you may or may not know, worse bugs. T2 base implemented a 'speed cap,' eliminating the adrenaline inspiring speeds that were possible in Tribes 1. 

Many top teams despised the game, mods were developed to return Tribes 2 to what had made T1 so great. Tribes 2 went on to have a comparably rich competitive scene to that of Tribes 1, but the game was always marred by its release debacle and true T1 heads never fully accepted the game.

Three and a half years later, notably lacking dedicated servers for the first week after launch. However, unlike Tribes 2, Tribes: Vengeance was never planned to be a successful title. T:V was the unwanted bastard child of publisher Vivendi, received piss poor marketing (I mean, just [look](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/Tvbox.jpg) at the box art), was launched among various triple A titles (Half-Life 2, and literally got no support after launch. The *very first* patch after launch was canceled after about 2-3 months of stringing along the community at large to the outrage of the competitive community.

Like Tribes 2, the dearest to my heart. However, Tribes veterans were so wary after the massive failure of the Tribes 2 launch that the community simply did not buy the game. By some reports, an abysmal 47,000 copies were sold 6 months after the launch of the game. Tribes fans were first burned when the T1 expansion was canceled, second burned when T2 failed to meet expectations, and burned again when T:V's lackluster launch was made worse by a complete lack of support from the publishers.

At that point, Legions, Rise, the list goes on and on), there was no way that any of these mods were going to revitalize the Tribes community, much less make it on their own as standalone titles. Legions came the closest, but InstantAction was 2-3 years before the Free2Play business model was figured out leading to the premature death of an otherwise promising platform.

**Part 2: Tribes Ascend**

Flash forward to  Tribes: Universe and Tribes: Ascend being announced by HiRez Studios. 

My first thoughts were something along the lines of ""Holy shit, burned, and downright angry from the previous Tribes failures. I truly felt like some small unknown developer was coming to rape the undead corpse of my beloved franchise for profit. I was scared.

However, they also embedded info from and the live broadcasting of these tournaments RIGHT in the game client itself, tapping into their massive player base to make for record breaking viewership numbers and escalating the competition. 

Maybe HiRez could do the same with Tribes Ascend? Maybe Ascend would be good enough that two weapon slots and no health kit wouldn't be a problem? Maybe Tribes in fact does have a future?

**Part 3: Tribes Ascend post-launch**

Tribes: Ascend was released in early beta and I picked it up right away. Of course I would, it wasn't my beloved Tribes 1 but it was by far the most fun I had had playing a new PC FPS since T:V and ET: Quake Wars. I reached out to Todd Harris through a mutual connection and expressed my interest in helping HiRez develop Ascend into an eSports title, promoting it through Twitch.tv, and sharing my rolledex of eSports organizers and personalities. 

Todd was markedly more responsive than the majority of execs at game development studios I speak to. Bart Koenigsburg then moved from a analysis role at HiRez to the straight up eSports Manager of Tribes Ascend. This

There was a **long** drout period where there were almost no hard core focused FPS games being developed for PC or console, DICE, etc (not for lack of trying!). So even though T:A isn't the ""perfect"" Tribes game nor does it have all the features you'd want for an eSports title, **it is still Tribes, it is still fun, and HiRez has proven they support the game for competitions and leagues.** To boot, the F2P model has and still does work well for HiRez

Obviously a point of heavy contention, better. Sniper nerfs, chasing buffs, central servers, a cheap and reliable way to set up servers with unique rulesets, a spectator tool that goes above and beyond (altho still needs more) what 95% of other FPS games offer, tons of new maps. While this could have and was done by modders in the past, and I have a decent vantage point to view this type of stuff. 

**Part 4: Recent Events and Conclusion**

Most recently, but in the end a very dissapointing result as Mono was forced to forfiet due to poor planning and poor luck. And with community 'leaders' like projectile and Mabel being *extremely* vocal in IRC &amp; reddit, it's easy to feel a sort of unease and even buy into their negativity. And hey, it's not Tribes 1 with better graphics. But god dammit, what we have here IS a Tribes game with an active community, mainstream appeal, and developers who do care. We haven't had this since, 2001 with Tribes 2. As a life long die hard Tribes fanatic there's no way I won't do everything I can to support this game and this community.

Since this has gotten so long

* Tribes is a niche game with a rocky past

* While the vocal minority of the competitive community may be outspoken

* We've had some snafoos

* I just fucking love Tribes and it makes me sad to see all this negativity. If you like the game, perhaps knitting?)

bonus points:

* HiRez is a small *independent* developer of less than 50 employees. This means they do not have stockholders to answer to, doubtfully as some kind of money making scheme (considering the ""success"" if previous Tribes games lolol).

* Ascend as an ""ESPORT"" - I doubt it can ever become a huge eSports title, and more top tier teams if we work WITH HiRez instead of demonizing them.

* The game has a long way to go to be ideal for competition, disrespectful, and tactless you are not going to be able to communicate effectively.

My feelings are that hi-rez are a very disappointing company that has not catered to the tribes series very well.  I understand that there are logistical limitations to a dev team of their size, we have to communicate everything through a middle-man, so there is the possibility of many ideas being lost in translation.

I hear a lot of excuses about their f2p model, good reputation, the game was originally part of the orange pack which sold retail, etc.), but it seems no less of a stretch to use the tf2 model than copying LoL's model, which is designed for an entirely different genre.  In fact, if anybody is aware of research or papers done on various f2p models, it feels like most arguments either for or against these models comes from the success/failures of other games (which have many variables that may or may not apply to the tribes franchise) or arguments coming simply from intuition.  

I'm going to be frank: the competitive scene will die (and die soon) if something drastic isn't done.  The iterative and ultra-slow process that hirez has been using to this point has been relatively ineffective at keeping people interested in the game.  There will probably be some influx of new players from pugs

So much of this problem could be fixed if they could figure out how to monetize the game while still allowing the ability to mod and create community content.

1) An option to enable toggle zoom for ONLY the BXT and Phase Rifles. It's quite annoying for those of us who like to use toggle zoom for sniping to change it each and every time we switch to/from sentinel

2) The option to choose HOW indicators are displayed. Icon Only / Text Only / or BOTH. Sure, especially in the presence of multiple deployables.

3) Add an element in the HUD that displays icons for what perks are currently active. It wouldn't have to be anything large

4) MORE CONSOLE COMMANDS! Call me old fashioned

5) Enable a ""quick escape"" from in game menus. Let's say I want to switch one of my Pathfinder classes Primary Weapons from Bolt Launcher to Dueling Spinfusor. I have to open the menu, select primary weapon, and choose my weapon. Then if I want to back out, I have to hit escape FIVE TIMES (or hit M and then escape). I don't think I'm alone when I say that hitting escape once, no matter where you are in the menu, should take you directly back to the game.

6) Custom crosshairs. CUSTOM CROSSHAIRS. People are already running the game in windowed/borderless mode and using third party programs to overlay crosshairs

7) First person spectating. Come on

8) While I don't expect this to ever happen

9) Team/Color coordination. [This picture explains it better than I can with words](http://i.imgur.com/rDaoW.jpg)


That's about all I have for now. I would love to hear feedback. Perhaps I will take it to the Hi-Rez forums soon.

There are a few things I do miss

-**The target painter**. I thought this was the coolest thing since sliced bread; a buddy would paint a target up, it told you the precise distance from whatever you were pointing at, could be use to signal other players, distract enemies or just generally have fun with as you were tailgunning.

-**The old Shrike**. The new Shrike is made out of paper mache; it handles almost like a direct port of a Banshee from Halo and I don't like it. I miss the old Shrike; it was a stubborn beast at first, the belly thrusters on the new Shrike are powered by AAA batteries or something; I miss being able to recover a bad dive by hammering the thrusters on neutral and *just* managing to keep it off the ground.  

-**Actually, loaded to the brim with Juggernauts dancing in their seats, exploding over your flag pad and raining green death upon you. I guess since its no longer a 32v32 game these sorts of things aren't quite as viable. Jerichos were brilliant little deployable assets as well. For those of you who didnt play, it was essentially a Mobile Point Base; you get in the Jericho, take it to position X (usually just outside your base or just outside the opponents base), and get out. The Jericho would then deploy itself, exposing a missile turret on its roof and an inventory station in the back. The current map design doesn't really allow for such a vehicle anymore unfortunately; maps like Arx Novena aren't really constructed for it and I'm sad that it had to go.

-**The Command Circuit**. Oh, but I often feel blind playing a FPS without some sort of map. The command circuit was one of the most intricate tactical maps ever. It gave an overlay of sensor positions, team assets, team mates, flag position and general terrain. With it, you could take active control over a turret (not actually that useful, the AI was almost always more accurate), mark waypoints

As an aside: this next patch is going to be pretty huge. It'll have the most balance adjustments since we changed the system to be weapon unlocks in Beta (many focused on better comp play)

Tribes: Ascend is a very ping dependent game. High ping, and have even caused some to quit the game entirely. 

   Hi-Rez first acknowledged this issue around eight months ago in the forum post referenced in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/139oli/please_support_the_lag_issue_thread_apc_confirmed/), in this [thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/182hu9/report_network_latencylag_in_game/ ).  

   There has been no further follow up from Hi-Rez on this issue, they still have not taken the appropriate actions.

HoF Accolades

* **Fatass** - Bring a fast-moving opponent to a drastically reduced speed.  This could potentially be restricted to a certain radius within the flag stand.

* **Bringing the Fat** - Kill an opponent with the Super Heavy perk.  Takes precedence over Flag Defender accolade and rewards slightly more credits.

* **Flytrap** - Kill a fast moving opponent with a forcefield.


Light/Heavy Offense Accolades

* **Deployable Down** - Destroy a forcefield, 5, 10, or etc -- TBD).

* **Stand Clear** - Destroy any number of forcefields or turrets when your team grabs the flag.

* **Distraction**- As your team grabs the flag


Light Defense Accolades

* **Base Defender** - Defeat LO within a certain radius of the flagstand.  This only applies up until a smaller radius of the flag

* **Focus** - Stop an enemy grabber while offense is trying to distract you (correlated with Distraction Accolade).

* **Anti-Siege Unit** - Kill an enemy juggernaut who has mortared your base in the past 30 seconds.

* **Escort** - Kill an enemy within a certain range of your flag carrier.


Chasing Accolades

* **Flag Drop** - Force the enemy flag carrier to drop your flag using either a nitron or sonic punch.  The throwing distance may scale the credits rewarded.  Throwing distance is tracked as a statistic.

* **IDGAF** - Rewarded when you knock the flag out of the enemy carrier's hands by midairing him with a nitron.  Does not require a kill.  Takes precedence over Flag Drop.  Semi-jokingly proposed.

* **Flag Watch** - Rewarded every five seconds the flag is down and the following conditions are met:  You are within a certain radius of your dropped flag; there are no enemies within a certain VISIBLE radius of the flag; your flag carrier is not within a certain radius of your flag stand.

* **Timely Return** - Rewarded when you return the flag when your flag carrier is within a certain radius of your flagstand.

* **Last Second Save** - Same range and conditions with E-Grab accolade

* **Flag Return (Revised)** - Rewarded only within the last five seconds of reset timer

1373357658.0,1hx9l5,Please give us an honest answer - yet another open letter to HiRez,AvianIsTheTerm,115,12,153,"Righteo

Basically, all we've heard about further development on Tribes is a handful of screenshots about Kate's CTF and Arena maps.

Anyone in the community could tell you that based on what we've seen, but they (or anyone else from HiRez) have yet to give us a straight answer about the status of the game.

Now I understand that neither APC nor Kate set HiRez company policy

So here's a really simple question for

I know it's super easy for members of the community to pipe up and say that the game's no longer being updated based on what we know

That's really not a hard question to answer. What would be most disappointing for me would be to have this thread posted, so there really is no excuse for not providing a clear-cut, unambiguous answer to a simple question.

HiRez does not owe the community more content - I'm not going to be too distraught if APC or whoever else answers and says that effectively Kate's maps are the last planned content

What HiRez *does* owe the community is the truth: we, and if so what are the reasons why content *has* been so sparse over the last while.

Based on the outcome of this, mapping tools will ever be released. But first things first, I'd like to get an answer on that basic question.

This is a bit of a response to the general feeling of frustration floating around the competitive scene in Tribes: Ascend.  I was thinking and trying to figure out why I was so uninterested in the supposed plight of the competitive players.  I realized that it's because I've been through all this once before.

I play paintball.  Paintball went through exactly what Tribes (and all of esports

Phase 1) There's this game that's a lot of fun to play.  You can customize the hell out of your equipment.  There's a very high skill ceiling.  People really enjoy playing it

Phase 2)  Hey

Phase 3)  People who already like the game are interested

Phase 4)  Ok that kind of worked, so they gradually get more and more of the fields dedicated to them.  Tournaments are now focused more as competitive events.

Phase 5)  The pros are pissed.  There's nowhere to go with this sport.  YOu can play in a few tournaments

Phase 6)  A general tone of ""this game is dying"" spreads through the hobby.  People enjoy the game enough to keep it alive

Sounds familiar, but it hasn't ever really happened, except maybe in the case of Starcraft in Korea. 

I don't mean to be all doom and gloom about it.  Somebody might crack the formula some day.  Right now, I think esports is goign to continue sharing paintball's fate of constant competitive limbo.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,DSTA,

I watched a guy try to escort his flag carrier in TDM yesterday for like 8 maps in a row.

Around a corner slides in our hero for an ultra low speed flag grab completely surrounded by both teams in one of those mega cluster fucks that make TDM so much fun.  He grabs it and starts walking up that  hill determined as ever.  Somewhere someone gets the kill, and just like that, our brave newbie makes his first clutch play.

For those new to this debate:


The Problem: Right now good cappers are unchasable because they can go 300 on a back to front. With regen they can front load a ton of speed by trading health for speed, or seriously wounding them before they hit the stand. This leads to stale action for players and viewers. Buffing chasing would allow hirez to nerf some aspects of the sniper as more focus could be on stopping the capper at the stand or chasing him down, which is far more exciting for players and spectators. The best buff to chasing would be to increase disc jump impulse, but doing so would allow cappers to go even faster so there would be an imbalance. This in turn would require the removal of health regen and addition of health packs so that cappers could not gain speeds so much higher than what a chaser could quickly attain. Hirez has stated that they do not want to make such a large change and do not want to remove regen, so the solution so far has been bandaid fixes that no one really likes.


Why TTAM's Idea is so good:


He has found a way to compromise between what hirez and comp players want, even if they respawn after a grab. This change also removes the frustrating and lame mechanic of snipers rapid firing to stop regen and allows for sniper nerfs without making cappers unstoppable. Moving the action to the stand and post grab chases are far more exciting than watching a capper setup for 40 seconds only to have his route screwed by a single shot from a sniper who can respawn into a great firing location seconds after being cleared by the offense. 


The only potential issue with his suggestion I see is causing additional balance problems with say raiders having both health kits and regen, please do everything you can on forums etc to encourage a solution along these lines and let this game be as awesome as it has the potential to be. 

EDIT: here is the text of the forum post
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some things I came up with the Tribal Council (I was the 'off the wall idea' guy):

•Test servers: Need private test servers so high-level competitive players can balance things quickly and comprehensively.

•Add quick draw across the board and make reloading faster (not my idea

•Health Kit/Health Regen Middleground: Make health regen slower (not more delayed

   •Hi-Rez save face by keeping regen and noobs probably won't notice.

   •Snipers do not destroy routes by stopping regen.

   •Snipers can be balanced by fall-off range and damage.

   •Compensates for the added lethality of across-the-board quick draw and faster reload  times.

   •Decreases the health-to-speed disparity between cappers and chasers because cappers cannot regen health (as much.)

   •Can make disc jump impulse higher at low speed without making cappers superluminal.

   •Adds depth to the game with health kit options (throwing

Because of the way votekick seems to need a huge majority as well as few players abstaining, once some people switch teams and then realize how bad it is.

My guess is that the /votekick system works as follows:

- Percentage of server is required for successful votekick (&gt;65%?)
- The vote of the person being voted on counts
- Abstaining is counted as a ""no""
- Spectators are also counted when calculating the total votes required

Because of this

I see cheaters every single day on the ""Air Combat"" servers (central NA region)

Obviously HiRez's automated cheat-detection isn't working in these cases. Please give us stronger tools to deal with these people ourselves.

What I'd like to see is

1. Banning based on IP, but I think it's far better than allowing people to use new smurf accounts every day to harass others).

2. Stop counting the target, then lower the vote % requirements for a successful kick.

3. Allow for a short description in the /votekick command:
""/votekick FoodForTheEagle For aimbot

I understand that there's also a /report function, and new player retention rates are going to suffer because of it. This is especially true when many new players aren't going to know how to initiate a votekick.

It also would be nice if APC or other HiRez rep would explain exactly how the /votekick and banning system works currently. (Does a series of successful votekicks ever perma-ban the account

Chasing is overpowered at low levels, because the grabs are so slow.  At high levels, however, chasers have a hugely tougher time catching up to cappers.  That is to say, as the average grab speed increases, chasing gets more difficult far more quickly than capping does.  So balance is quite different at a higher level.

This is true about a lot of other things.  Raider O, because low-level players aren't nearly as good at chaining as higher-level players.  HoFing, like chasing, is easier at low levels, because it gets exponentially more difficult to stop cappers as they come in at higher speeds.  Etcetera.  

The only solution to this is to bring pub play and comp play closer together.  Obviously, making the switch from pub to comp easier and finally strengthening the community.

In order to do that, in particular, is rather abysmal.  I also think they should add a basic tactics tutorial that would cover things like not llama grabbing, not returning the flag when it's in a secure position, coordinating clears with grabs, etc.  They also might want to add a basic ""roles"" tutorial or something like that.  

One other thing that might help would be dividing pub play into two levels

If they could lessen the gap between pub and comp play like that, they might be a lot more willing to introduce a lot of the changes people have been asking for.",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,False,,

1338667927.0,uhl7e,New Deployable Suggestion: Boost Ramp,Hymnosi,114,28,56,"Specifications

- Replaces the DMB Forcefield
- Provides a 45-60 degree ramp for allies(and enemies) to use
- Provides a 50-100 KPH boost to anyone who uses boost in the correct direction (not including enemies)
- Ramp has a sizable wall on the opposite side
- Ramp does not boost you if the generator is down
- Cannot be placed inside walls like the forcefield
- Cannot be placed close to the flag like the regular forcefield.  
- Boost Ramp has double the HP of the Forcefield. 
- Maximum of 1 deployed

Implications

Currently the biggest issue people have with Tribes meta is that chasing is worthless against a pathfinder travelling over 300.  Besides slowing down pathfinders

Another point is that enemy flag cappers can use your ramp to benefit if they know how to run routes that would utilize the ramp sitting on your stand

Other possibilities is to let us open routes to the flag that normally wouldn't be possible

Yet another is allowing the fatter of us get to midfield faster to deal with Juggernauts and other long ranged spam.  This allows us to have heavy defense other than the HoF.",self,t5_2rdsl,1338669682.0,,BE,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/uhl7e/new_deployable_suggestion_boost_ramp/

&gt;
&gt;I agree that custom mapmaking would increase T:A longevity and strengthen community.  I'm skeptical that it would bring in a lot of new players; but for players who enjoy TA it means new content
&gt;
&gt;And there is no real issue with F2P model since we decided not to charge for maps anyway.
&gt;
&gt;One of the reasons we chose UE3 was the strength of the editor &amp; mod scene.  In fact many of our Tribes dev team members have modding/mapping background.
&gt;
&gt;Supporting community/custom maps would involve:
&gt; - distributing version of UE editor that also includes T:A specific functionality (for example after you make your map you'd want to be able to test skiing/physics)
&gt; - distributing version of UE editor that doesn't overly expose us to hackers/cheats
&gt; - deployment system for creators to upload maps and then players to download as needed; plus some review process for hi-rez to prevent/minimize dildo maps.
&gt;
&gt;To do #3 (the deployment part) right, but not yet scheduled. 
&gt;
&gt;So

1341205335.0,vwtcl,conluceo presents: 3 ways to not be useless in Tribes:Ascend,conluceo,111,25,68,"So

**STOP BEING USELESS!**

How is this done you ask yourself. One would maybe check out some routes to learn

**What are the goal of a Tribes:Ascend match?**

Winning a match is accomplished by *playing the objective*. What does this mean? While there are many ways you can spend your time during the match there is only one thing that leads to victory, nothing comes before that. If you have a teammate bearing the enemy flag, do whatever you can to help her. If the enemy is trying to grab your flag, do what you can to stop him. Ask yourself from time to time, does this help in acquiring or defending the flag? If not, you are doing something wrong.

**What can You do to bring your team to victory?**

**1. Clearing the enemy flag stand.**

*What and why?* To prevent the other team from grabbing the flag a (good) team sets up all kinds of defenses around the flag and base. Without assistance your cappers won't have a chance to get thru the forcefield

*How its done:* This is a really simple one. Ski to a vantage point where you have a clear line of sight towards the enemy flagstand and base. Begin shooting wildly at the enemy flag stand. Take out all deployable's and turrets. Keep shooting at the flag stand to make sure your cappers have a clean route to take. When the enemy comes to kill you

*Suitable classes:* Soldier, Raider

*Next step:* Being closer to the flag stand makes you able to augment your assault with grenades and easier kill the moving targets

**2. Defending the flag from cappers**

*What and why?* A lot of damage can be done to incoming cappers before they reach the flag stand. This is much easier than chasing since they often come in a straight and predictable arc towards you

*How:* Stand at the flag stand, your body will block cappers to a certain degree. Look at the sky and terrain around you and note incoming enemies. When it's clear they are coming in to cap begin spamming your automatic gun at them. Use your alt key and spot them for your teammates. Take note from where they come from, soon you will be able to identify an incoming capper from very far away. Spot as often as you can to get (when you suspect a capper) to get your teammates attention. When they near the stand spam them with automatic fire. Or if you prefer to use a spinfuzor you can keep the capper in your sight and try to hit him when touches the flag. If he managed to grab keep spamming automatic fire in his direction. SSS (Spot, spam, spot)

*Suitable classes:* Pathfinder, Technician, Raider

*Next step:* Go Sentinel and try to snipe those pesky cappers out of existence, but that's beyond the scope of this guide. Google it.

**3. Defending the flag stand from harassment**

*What and why?* As stated in the first post in this list harassing the enemy flag stand is a necessity to clear it for incoming cappers. Naturally we want to prevent this. Our job will be to make sure those people have other things on their mind than to shoot explosives at the defenses we so carefully set up to guard our flag.

*How its done:* Stand somewhere around your flag stand. Look around. Are there any enemies skiing towards you? Ski towards them and kill them before they reach your base and unload their barrage at your poor flag defenders. Look at the sky, and kill them. Easy, right? Avoid being stuck up in duels in places that are not important. Concentrate on the ones that actually pose a clear and present danger to your flag defenses. Don't feel bad if you get killed, the time it took to duel you was a lot of time wasted from doing damage to the defenders.

Suitable classes: Pathfinder, Brute

Next step: Try to coordinate point two and three

**(I) I got credits

In a match you receive credits for kills, something that does give you more experience. There are a few good ways to spend your dough in a match. 

* Give your HoF (Heavy on flag) an inventory station calldown. Having easy access to mines and force fields will make him very happy. They are also quite easy to destroy so he might be low on cash after calling in a few for himself already.

* Get some wheels. If you play a heavy class and are working on harassing the enemy base a gravcycle to get there can be a worthwhile investment. Especially on larger maps like Raindance.

* Strikes should primarily be saved for the enemy flagstand.

* If you have Technicians working the turrets and generators

**(II) On life and death**

On the whole, you were removed from *playing the objective* a lot longer than she were.

Killing players should be done when they either threaten your defenses or your cappers or is preventing you from *playing the objective*. Ask yourself

Also

**(III) A comprehensive guide to shit that be flag related**

When the enemy drop the flag it sits on the ground for 30 seconds before automatically being returned back to your flag stand. The most basic instinct is to return it as soon as possible, it's often a fairly open place, with multiple routes in and out. The flag might have bounced to a position where it's in much better cover, or close to a wall making high speed grabs neigh impossible. Most cappers have also trained routes that culminate in grabbing the flag at it's stand, not 100 meters away tucked in behind two rocks. There is also another benefit in that the enemy have to set up capping routes towards the flags new position, while you are being able to return the flag to it's stand at the first sight of danger.

We will now take a look at situations where it's very beneficial to let the flag stay out in the field for a while or not. 

When to return the flag:

* There is enemies in the general vicinity of the flag.

* Your team has the enemy flag at or close to your base ready to cap it.

* The flag is in an exposed place

* You are alone close to the enemy base.

* You don't have good vision of the surrounding area.

When to NOT return the flag

* The flag is in a harder to reach place than your flag stand

* Your team is not in control of your flag stand

* Your flag stand lack defenders.

* You spot incoming cappers towards your flag stand.

* You can bounce the flag to a safe place with your weapon.

I gladly accept points on the language in this guide since I'm not a native English speaker. Also

-Flag capping - I can capture maybe one time out of every twenty.  Most of the time I either get blown up at the moment of the grab because I didn't see that guy with a jackal standing nearby with his perfect timing, sits around eating ice cream?  They're certainly not taking any of the pressure off me.  So I eventually die, and the enemy flag carrier walks over and caps.

-Base defense/repair - playing as Technician, I *would* politely ask them to leave so I can repair the gen, but they'd just LOL and shoot me in the face, and when I shoot back I'd just miss, because...

-Fighting/Dueling - I'm terrible.  I have poor aim, he moved?  Agh, I just took damage!  What's going on?  Oh, I'm dead?  Darn it.  I'll just respawn, and ski back over to the enemy base.  Hey, there's another guy, and he doesn't see me.  HAHA, what's he doing?  Okay

I'm sick of companies who are largely incompetent and can't release something like a simple skin without breaking half the game due to a combination of inability to do basic development and lack of proper testing. I'm sick of developers who are too money-hungry to spend the time to develop

I'm sick of a game so buggy that server crashes and general glitching are not only common

I'm sick of people calling me a faggot for going into a pub and chaining just so I can practice my aim a bit, instantly declaring a win for whichever team has an actual capper.

I'm sick of the negative attitude of the entire competitive community in general and how whiny those players have gotten. I'm sick of the back-and-forth narcissism evident every time a rule change vote comes up and how demanding players are. I'm sick of accusations of cheese by those who run cheese themselves. I'm sick of the mood swings popping up every time we get a patch and the fallout two days later. Most of all I'm sick of the petty arguments between players and teams who rarely know fuck all what they're talking about or even what the argument was when they started. (Seriously grow up.)



I love you guys, after taking as much as a week long break and seeing what a well-constructed game with good developer support was, I highly doubt I could ever go back to tribes without being peeved by the state of things. At this point, excluding the friendships I've made, I've invested way more time into this game than it's worth.

Thank you for all the fun we've had together and thank you for accepting me into the community all things considering; I really appreciate it. I'll still be in IRC and Steam every day and Mumble not so much

Tonight while Arx Novena was loading up as the next map and I was thinking of going HoF, and it was hilarious.

Each spawn, and throw out 3 mines.  I basically used the EXACT SAME tactic I would use if I were heavy on my own damn flag.  Here are some of the wonderful things I saw happen:

1.  Just as I'd hoped, the flag flew through and just happened to land on me for an instant return.  lulz ensued.

2.  Half the duels I got into wound up with my target bouncing into one of my mines.  Never have I gotten so many mine kills.

3.  I lost count of the mine kills I got on cappers right as they were about to score.  The return was almost always easy.

4.  After about 10 minutes

5.  I found that I almost ALWAYS had another mine to plant whenever one was destroyed- there was enough carnage that ammo pickups presented themselves quite frequently.

6.  I think I had like 8 Aftermath kills thanks to all the mines.

Now it wasn't completely perfect.  We did lose the match.  Our team wound up with like 6 PTH's because I think everyone was inspired to make runs at the enemy base that we so clearly owned, but I was having too much fun with my little experiment.

If you decide to try this

1.  You can very easily ACCIDENTALLY llama grab.  You won't mean to do it.  You'll be very diligently NOT grabbing the enemy's flag while you're bouncing around throwing out mine's like you're a flower girl

2.  Make sure your loadout gives you LOTS of mines to throw down.  I can throw out 4 at a time and carry 3

3.  Make sure your force shield is maxed out.

4.  I was lucky in that the only enemy who was interested in HoFing wasn't very skilled and I was able to take him down enough times to frustrate him into trying something else.  If a really good HoF sets up camp

5.  GRAB EVERY AMMO PICKUP YOU SEE

6.  ???

7.  Profit!!!

Secondly the chasing perks need to be changed. Lightweight is the easiest to fix just give it some extra levels

-Lightweight v2-

* mass reduction
* Pre-patch Safe Fall effect
* Moderate version of Quick Draw

Lightweight would retain the regen penalty so you wouldn't use it for capping.

The other perk that needs fixing is Rage. The problem mostly lies in the fact that you can't buff the rage radius without majorly buffing Phase Rifle SEN however we can fix that AND fix the health problems chasers have in one fell swoop.

Simply get rid of the energy regen effect on Rage. Replace it with a short (3-5 seconds) period of invulnerability/major reduction to **ONLY SELF damage**. This lets the chaser get up to speed without taking him down to 50 health if the flag gets grabbed 

Chasers could also now run explosive nitrons which should more than make up for the tiny bit of extra speed cappers will gain from using the un-nerfed nitrons.

Next up, the answer is a ratio.  In other words for every X customers you gain, you need to hire 1 more person for the support team^2 .  Last I [checked](http://www.hirezstudios.com/hirezwp/?page_id=2023), HiRez was not hiring additional support or QA personnel.  To me, that translates to them saying 1 of 2 things: 1) ""We don't care about supporting our current users"" or 2) ""We think our current level of support is ok and we don't expect the game to continue to grow"".  

I view the lack of QA and Support personnel as a big problem.  The lack of QA will prevent the game from becoming balanced in the near future and it certainly won't stay balanced without their constant input.  If there aren't enough Customer Support personnel, the freemium business model relies on longevity in their games.  They need happy customers buying new things in order to continue to make money.  Considering I've already seen substantial outcry here about the state of both QA and support, I don't think I'm remiss in saying HiRez is already behind in both of these areas.

For these problems I blame HiRez, grow and seize the potential so many of us see in it.

If anyone at HiRez reads this, my momentum is headed toward the other slope.  The one where I'm playing LoL and waiting for Shootmania to come out in the hopes that there will finally be a fun, skill-based FPS for me to play.  Really, it would take immediate action from someone on the level of Erez Goren (Founder and CEO) or Stewart Chisam (VP and Executive Producer) to keep me skiing.

^1: I did tech support for a while and it really does feel like 90% of the people I talked to were yelling at me.

However as a developer I know how morale breaking it can get to hear only complaints and negative feedback all the time because the people who are enjoying stuff generally don't go out of their way to send in ""Yeah everything is ok"" comments. We all obviously enjoy playing this game so let's just say what makes us enjoy it.


So


The new patch introduced a lot of new weapons and it's become pretty popular to bitch about what's OP. However I've noticed that pretty much everyone who has gotten together to talk about it has different opinions on what's OP and what's not. The recent behind the blue plate episode highlights this pretty well. I take this sort of thing as a sign of general balance. If most people can't agree on what's overpowered that means that they are all generally balanced.


Second I **love** the new weapons that reward direct hits


*edit*

Thirdly the new upgrade system. This is pretty much perfect in my opinion. I had some reservation about it before the announced that you could instantly master the item with XP or just play the class till you mastered it that way (all while still gaining XP to spend). So you can master the stuff you main and then just let other stuff upgrade over time. I mostly play Capper and Raider LO so I dumped XP/Gold to get the new stuff and master itr  for those class and I just let other classes that I use to fart around in pubs upgrade on their own.

Ever since the inventory glitch fiasco, hacks, exploits, etc, I was very lenient on allowing these types of posts on /r/tribes.

However, something that Reddit is very good at doing.  [Hi-Rez has responded to this situation](http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=234&amp;t=74650&amp;p=944676#p944676), and you can make of that as you will.

While bringing it up in a public matter like this has had marginal success(flaxig has been unbanned), a website Hi-Rez *does* read.  When there are 7 posts about this on the front-page, something has to change.  And I'm not counting on Hi-Rez's state of the art anti-cheat to actually kick in.  We've created a scenario where if someone posts they've been unfairly banned, the community rallies behind them without any hard evidence proving or disproving their claim.  Yeah, it sucks, but it really is a 'guilty until proven innocent' situation when it comes to game bans (not exclusive to T:A).  And you can almost *never* provide that kind of evidence.

1335293247.0,sqd0s,Hot Gas: An objective look at why the Plasma Gun is terrible,Shamus_Aran,110,37,102,"I think we've all figured out by now that the Plasma Gun is a load of shazbot. But why? How did this weapon become so horribly broken? How can it be repaired? And what does this failure teach us?

Watch me now. I'm going to start analyzing.

* **#1: It’s essentially a better Spinfusor.**

It has a roughly equal travel speed, but the ability to kill people before they can even get within ten feet of the flag rather obviates that weakness. Which leads me to...

* **#2: It inflates the Raider’s role far too much.**

With the Plasma Gun, the Raider can now do better. And seeing as the Soldier is the “all-rounder” class, that’s a serious gaffe.

* **#3: It’s no fun to use.**

With its “Baby’s First” hitbox and nigh-automatic rate of fire, where did the challenge go? Where’s the excitement? The most fun I’ve ever had in this game was accurately predicting a projectile’s path to coincide with a tiny dot that was my enemy, and hearing that nice THUNK as it connected. If you take the effort out of that, there’s no point!

* **#4: It’s no fun to have it used on you.**

See above. There’s nothing more frustrating than being bombarded with 500-a-pop balls of lightning

* **#5: #1 and #2 make it Pay To Win.**

And that is a travesty. It’s easy, and the Fist of God is in your hands!

So how do we fix it?

* **A) Shift it to either side of the spectrum

By this I mean make the Plasma Gun more of an automatic weapon (by lowering its damage and hitbox) or more of a Spinfusor (by lowering its fire rate and projectile speed). By this I do *not* mean lowering its fire rate and buffing its damage

* **B) Penalize the Raider for using it.**

Make the Raider have to give up something, make the Plasma Gun fire using energy, a la the Phase Rifle. Heck, while we’re at it, maybe the Plasma Gun could react negatively to an active shield and heavily damage a Raider trying to use both at once!

* **C) Get rid of it and give the people who bought it their money back.**

Maybe the Plasma Gun can’t or won’t be fixed. In that case, its Pay-To-Win, boring, but horribly effective qualities are going to kill Tribes Ascend.

PuGs should not be a scary thing

Joining a pug is simple

* Join the mumble at mumble.tribespugs.com port: 36085  Label it whatever you want

* Make sure you have push-to-talk enabled^1

* Right click-&gt;self-&gt;change comment.  Put in order your main roles (capper, defense, HoF). Not really needed, but is useful if there are 20 cappers and no defense to see what else people play.

* Search through the channels for your region^2 and the role you want to show off or practice

* Wait for some games to start and have some fun.

If there is no one on, they will come back to the roles and repick.

General rules:

* **Friendly Fire is on.**

* Jackal, and white outs are all banned.

* Sentinels: one per team

* No upgrading base assets.

* Shrikes: one per team

* Call ins: No tactical or orbital strikes. Bonus reputation for killing someone with an inventory station.

HOW TO:

Use the Stereoificator (I've had a lot more luck with it than the standard Vireio injection driver it's a fork of) http://www.chrisdrain.com/hmd-stereoificator/

Add this below your last game in the profile.xml: &lt;profile game_name=""Tribes"" game_exe=""TribesAscend.exe"" shaderModRules=""unreal.xml"" rollEnabled=""true"" worldScaleFactor=""3.5"" /&gt;

Add this after your last game in the users.xml: &lt;game game_name=""Tribes"" horizontalFoV=""110"" separationAdjustment=""-0.001"" swap_eyes=""true"" yaw_multiplier=""25"" pitch_multiplier=""25"" roll_multiplier=""1"" /&gt;

insert the 3 dlls in your bin into the Tribes Ascend folder that has your TribesAscend.Exe

Set your field of view to 110. Turn off all the hud settings and crosshair for now. Turn your graphics settings in game to the lowest setting (I tried just keeping it high and disabling dynamic shadows, it still looks really good in the Rift with texture detail on high.

Now, base markers to be kosher with SBS 3D is the only problem. I would gladly play it without, the projectile weapons are fine without a crosshair but spinfusing with a crosshair is already difficult as is. It's compatible with 3D Vision. I've read using 3d Vision the crosshair and all the 2d markers are fine. I set 3dVisionEnabled to True in the .ini and tried to launch it with blue red 3dVision, only difference was color changes in the menus.

Part of the reason commentary works in real life team based games like football (american or european) is that the players can either be called by their number or have distinctive physical features that help everyone remember how they play and what they're usually doing. Not so for T:A. Listening to the rapid babbling of the commentators hopelessly trying to describe everything going on in a scene was a trainwreck. That time could have been so much better spent explaining the general tactics each team was using and

If a fight over the flag is happening midfield,"" there's not much more insightful than that. Why not instead take the time to jump to the HoF, maybe (as T:A is still new) take the time to explain what he's doing there, and look at the nuances of how he prepares for the fight midfield to start moving toward him. Jump to the generators now and then and talk about how heavily the team's present strategy depends on the generator staying active. If so, what's the other team doing about that?

I don't want to hassle the commentators about it

To you guys out there who really, for us regular folks who want to enjoy watching this with friends one day, the ability of commentators to give us a good picture of the game is really important to the eSport experience. Perhaps someone totally independent should be controlling the camera. Maybe we ought to have multiple cameras with the commentators choosing on the spot which should be shown at the time.

But nothing is more important than practical knowledge of the ""big picture"" of a game and the ability to analyze what's going on beyond just individual roles.

Postby mmerner » Fri Mar 08

I haven't played Tribes with any competitiveness since a time that all lag could firmly be blamed on a 56k dialup connection. I guess this day and age low latency and lack of lag is a much bigger deal :D. I'm going to try my best to explain what can be concluded from your network testing

First and foremost, but sincerely doubt it), it leaves us with two options for the source of the lag. The first, is that there is a shared upstream provider (large intermediary internet backbone) used by both us and some other ISPs which is having some sort of ongoing routing issue. The second is there is an issue inside of Hi-Rez's network or servers. I would suspect it is their servers due to the fact they are the single (geographically diverse) commonality between all the problems. It is possible if they were running identical network architecture in both their datacenters, an network issue could arise in tandem at both locations but that is highly unlikely.

Your MTRs both seem accurate on latency to the given geographical locations of the 2 Tribes servers. As toast0 correctly stated, the latency spike would have to follow every single hop to the end of the traceroute/mtr. All of the data you have provided shows perfectly normal and decongested network paths. Now forward and return paths almost always take different routes so without return traceroutes from the Hi-Rez servers towards your IP, we have an incomplete view of your issue. If you can somehow get them to provide one to you, it could give more useful information, though I suspect that to be unlikely. The combination of forward and reverse traceroutes can be used to identify the exact location of a network issue when one exists, but as I don't see indication of one in the traceroutes you provided, trying to acquire a reverse would be a waste of time and energy.

If Hi-Rez provides any more specific information on what they believe the client ISP problem to be and/or how it manifests, my personal opinion is that the problem likely lies with the servers themselves. The one key questions that comes to mind is, does everyone on the server experience the chop/warp at exactly the same time?

Donations are much appreciated.  All financial information will be made public

For anyone wishing to play some PUGs we will be starting tonight as soon as we have enough players so hop on mumble to join.

Our road-map for the future is as follows:

1. Expand too two more NA servers.
2. Increase mumble too 100-slots.
3. Set up an EU server.

Any Europeans if you would like to donate for a EU server please do so above and send me an e-mail at tribesascendpug [at] gmail [dot] com and your donation will be put aside for an EU server.  We will launch the EU server as soon as we have enough donations or Monday

1376641081.0,1kh6ym,TA SDK - Mapping For The Lazy,Khorrin,73,4,10,"Hello

***

First off

It's a package I made to make things a bit easier. It includes a basic [blank map with textured terrain, and generators already placed on the map.](http://i.imgur.com/99e12no.jpg) It should build and start up in the dev client without errors.

***

Next you will need to download;

* The bin.torrent included in the package. (Tribes Dev Kit)

        You can also go here: https://github.com/AltimorTASDK/TASDK/blob/master/bin.torrent

* http://download.udk.com/UDKInstall-2011-01-BETA.exe (UDK)

Once UDK is installed

***

The next two steps (stolen from the old guide) are pretty straight forward.

* Put the folder 'TribesGame' that you extract from the .rar into (for example) C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\Development\Src\. (I've included the same folder as the old guide

* Go to (for example) [C:\UDK\UDK-2011-01\UDKGame\Config\ and open UDKEngine.ini

***

Next you're going to want to do is make a shortcut to open up the UDK editor. Go to the UDK installation location

Right click on 'UDK.exe', to the end of the 'target' field. Should look something like

    C\UDK\Binaries\UDK.exe editor

Hit OK and double click to open the UDK editor. The first time you do this it will ask to rebuild outdated scripts. Hit 'Yes'

***

VGW! You made it!

What you're probably seeing is a giant blue grid, Load up the 'TrCTF-GenericMapBase.udk' included in this package, (File -&gt; Open). 

You should see a big grass square with a couple dots on it. If you can't, and using WASD.

***

Before we edit the terrain; If you do not like the size of the terrain, and 'Num Patches Y', to the desired size.](http://i.imgur.com/AXemxsZ.png) The next section has a more crude way of doing this.

***

To Edit the Terrain; [Open up the 'Terrain Editing Mode' (Hotkey: Shift-3).](http://i.imgur.com/fj6N4Cd.png)

There are a few different tools you can use.

* 'Add/Remove Sectors'. This lets you adjust the size of the terrain canvas.
* 'Paint' This lets you adjust the Height of the terrain
* 'Flatten' This lets you bring the surrounding terrain
* 'Smooth' smoothes out jagged edges.
* 'Average' averages the height of the targeted terrain area. I find using this tool with the 'Strength' set to 1 or 2
* 'Noise' - not good for gaining sanics.
* 'Visibility' Punches holes in the terrain
* That's all I've experimented with.

You make use of all these, then using Ctrl+Click (Left to increase, Right to decrease) on the map itself.

*You can set the value of 'Strength/Radius/Falloff' way past what the sliders allow by typing into the field manually.

***

The map I've provided already has the Flags

UDK has 'fake' script files in place (The ones included in the TribesGame.rar), it shows the assets as point lights, but when loaded up in the Tribes Dev Client, it will show as the actual flag/generator/inven station.

Anyway. To move these objects

For the map included

* Brush_0
* Terrain_0
* TrCTFBase_BloodEagle_0
* TrCTFBase_DiamondSword_0
* TrPowerGenerator_BloodEagle_0
* TrPowerGenerator_DiamondSword_0
* UTTeamPlayerStart_0 (Blood Eagle)
* UTTeamPlayerStart_1 (Diamond Sword)
* WorldInfo_0

You can double click any of these or select it and hit 'Go To'

To change selection modes

***

The map file included does not have Inventory stations spawns. I haven't messed around with them yet. If you want them

* [Go to the Content Browser
* Select the 'Actor Classes' tab. 
* Search: Inventory
* [Click on 'TrInventoryStation' or 'TrInventoryStation_Neutral' then click and drag them onto the map.](http://i.imgur.com/ETZitUU.png)
* Pray they work in the Dev Client

***

When you're ready to test your map with the Tribes Dev Build

*If you do not 'Save As'

Next, and put it into the Tribes Dev Build map folder. (C:\TribesDevBuild\bin\TribesGame\CookedPC\Maps\).

Time for another shortcut. Go to the 'Binaries' folder of your TRIBES DEV BUILD (C:\TribesDevBuild\bin\Binaries\Win32\). Make a shortcut to TribesAscend.exe

    C:\TribesDevBuild\bin\Binaries\Win32\TribesAscend.exe TrCTF-GenericMapBase -seekfreeloading

Hit OK and double click the shortcut. The client should loadup

***

Few extra notes;

* Once you're ingame
 * Note note; The console commands don't work in chat even though the dropdown menu pops up to autofill.

* If you  renamed the map file; keep in mind that in order for the tribes client to run the map as CTF

* If you add more objects; since they are light sources

* If you  add more textures and objects from the content browser to your map (Skybox ect), you'll get errors when you try to start it up in the dev build.

***

The wiki has plenty of information

All the new weapons need plenty of tactics. Create a new bulletpoint and write it under the ""tactics"" section of each weapon. If it does not exist, you may make an entirely new line. An example is shown on the [BXT1 page](http://www.tribesascendwiki.com/BXT1_Rifle), comparing it to the phase rifle.

Not all the articles are written in 3rd person at the moment, and grammar. You don't have to be a perfect writer; as long as you can write up something that doesn't sound like a fifth grader wrote it, you will be fine.

**Specific requests:**

- We could really use a clear picture of the BXT1-A rifle. This likely means that you will have to have it unlocked OR not have the sentinel class unlocked since the price tag slightly obscures it. Cutting a small amount of the bottom off due to the upgrade text is fine

- We need the price values for a number of raider weapons.

- We need updated automatic weapon damage values on a few of the automatics. 

- We need a number of [roles](http://www.tribesascendwiki.com/Roles) added. If you play one of these roles please submit some tips so that new players can learn.

- Most of the price tables need updating. They can be found on each class' page.

3 months",14,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/xx0s5/what_was_fixed_on_the_ui_during_the_last_3_months/,"Remember [that big post about fixing the UI from 3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/t7bfw/hey_hirez_stop_doing_content_packs_and_fix_the_ui/)? Plenty of time, right? Let's see what was actually fixed.

Fixed things will be ~~stroked through~~

Added things will be **bold**. They might have been present 3 months before

--------

Most Recent Match History    

* shows only 1 match (and only if you haven't closed the client
* doesn't show the match ID
* doesn't show how long the players have been in the game (time played divided by match length as a percentage would be nice)
* doesn't show a player's most played class that round
* doesn't show the map it was played on (come on
* shows little rank icons which no one has memorized; show  the number instead
* no *back* button
* date is always 2/12/12
* accolades in the rightmost places which are in triple digits have their units and tens cut off
* doesn't highlight own name

Player Overview

* ~~Win/Loss ratio is present but not calculated~~
* no text on the most recent awards (am I again expected to memorize icons?)
* Flag Defense and Flag Caps are random numbers (they both seem to be the amount of flag defenses I've made
* More stats would be appreciated

Badges

* Switching the page of badges triggers the menu transition animations

Class Edit UI

* The transition animation is way too long (especielly bothersome when managing class upgrades and friends list) and should be optional
* ~~No saveable loadouts~~ yay monetization!
* when viewing a class

Loading Screen

* doesn't show an image of the upcoming map (which has been industry standard for years)

~~VGS~~

* ~~VU**T** -&gt; Upgrade **S**ensors~~
* ~~VU**S** -&gt; Upgrade **T**urrets~~

Settings

* ~~VGS and Announcer volume level settings reset on logout~~
* Chat filter setting resets on logout
* ~~enable/disable Chat HUD option not seperate from Class Selection/Modification HUD notification. (You cant disable chat without disabling the notifications of hotkey presses for class changing~~

Combat UI

* ~~deployables counter broken~~
* 3rd person camera height (which is useful for close combat due to higher FOV) doesn't take into account the player model and is not useful for heavy classes
* add icons for turrets and sensors next to the generator icon
* ~~own team is always blue
* ~~when there is a vote to kick someone there's a prompt that says F5 = No; F6 = Yes
* time left on team selection is always 10:35
* there's no indication (neither visual nor audio) how long it takes for claymores to be primed (it's about 2 seconds); ~~and while we're at it
* ~~icons for *call ins* (tactital
* ~~after opening a menu via shortcut (e.g. J for friends list)
* Kill details cover up VGS http://i.imgur.com/IM6SP.jpg
* UI elements cover up the flag marker http://i.imgur.com/DbFOg.jpg
* **Called targets (with ALT) are marked as being light armor

Scoreboard

* **ping is next to score which makes it a tad harder to distinguish in the heat of the moment**

Spectating

* **First person spectating does not have weapon model and crosshair**
* **In spectating
* the *time until next health regen* is fixed at 204 seconds

Training - Target Practice

* Most bots have the symbol for heavy armor

General

* The UI looks like it was made for a console. The class edit could greatly benefit from a UI where you can edit your loadout of a class in just one page.

Before I get into what is needed I am going to link a screenshot of the activity on the paypal so you all know what your money has been spent on in the past.  You can find that [here](http://imgur.com/BM4JX).  The names of anyone who donated have been blacked out for obvious reasons.

Currently our money is being spent on two things mumble and tribes servers we have six tribes servers: 1-3 are normal ctf

The breakdown of how the money will be spent is as follows:

$50 for 7500 tribes gold

$28 for one month renewal of the 200 slot mumble.  Although we do not often need more then 150 slots with the special events we did go over and as we plan to hold more events I feel the extra $7 is worth it.    The mumble renews on August 21st. This brings the total to $78.

The second donation is more long term

As always thanks for all your support everyone.  Feel free to leave any feedback on the pickups in the thread below.

Edit: Fixed broken link.  Thanks everyone for your donations so far already getting close to our goal.

We have reached both our goals thank you to everyone for supporting this.  This community is amazing that is over two hundred dollars raised in three hours.

It seems like every time I visit /r/tribes it is dotted with posts about how the game is dying and HiRez's refusal to update the game.  

So

Tribes has one of the best communities out there. Sure, reddit, etc, but if you tell me that there is another community that is as invested in the survival of their beloved game than I would be forced to disagree. 

HiRez has created an environment where fostering a successful community is damn-near impossible but through the efforts of the community we did our best to keep it going. Everything good about this game is community-based. The majority of our problems are from HiRez's poor development and refusal to actual support and grow Tribes: Ascend as an Esport. 

So, comp players, etc. you all made tribes that much more of an enjoyable experience for the players.

**AnRedditTribe.**
http://www.reddit.com/r/anreddittribe and their mumble  mumble.anreddittribe.net:34883

A great community that is very very welcoming of new players and casuals alike. Anyone can stop by the mumble, you can sometimes find some fun grav cycle racing, or other random crazy antics. It's a fun place where players are just looking to laugh and have a good time. Recommend this to people that...

* Are looking for more people to play with

* A gaming community

* New

* Those frustrated with disorganization of Public games

* Players that want to do fun out-of-the-ordinary tactics

* Players that want to create fun game modes like shrike tag

There is also the **RedditPugs** which are opening up. These are a bit different, capper, etc.) And are expected to play the roles a general way. They like to teach people how to play and offer advice to anyone willing to learn. The big difference here is there are more defined specifics on how to play these roles. While no one will tell you that playing offensive technician is ""bad"" you would probably get the recommendation that the raider may do the job better. This is a great middle ground for players that want to test the waters of competitive play, or those that are looking to play in a team and try out tournaments.
You should recommend this to players that...

* Want to play competitively

* Are bored in normal Public games

* Are constantly ""top of the chart"" and want to know where to play against better players

* Want to play a specific role in a team (I love capping but hate how in pubs I'm always Llama'd while I'm going 300+ sanics!!!)

* Are trying to maximize their talent and find their potential

* Test their skills against strong players

A lot of people have been asking how to get better performance. This Tribes.ini setup sets your graphics to be SIGNIFICANTLY lower than minimal settings. This is explicitly for people struggling with 20 - 30 fps when using minimal settings

Notes

How to use:

Find your Tribes.ini file and make a copy of it. Place it on your desktop and DO NOT touch it! This will be your backup. Then, so keep it fairly low. Enter a game! If the graphics are too low for your liking, simply delete your edited Tribes.ini file and drag the Tribes.ini file on your desktop into your config file! All settings will be back to your previous setup.

DynamicLights Can be set to False (Default is True) to gain 5 to 10 FPS, also making it very difficult to see enemies at reasonably far distances.

What if we had a canyons'n'mesa map that used the same style of exposed rock formation. All points of the same altitude would have the same layer of rock across the map. It could make it more interesting to guesstimate distances and see more clearly where you are going to land.

Plus it would just look dead sexy.

Most of you saw on the Dev Blog that my goal for the next patch is to have 2 CTF maps. I’m pleased to say that the “KatArx” map has been playing well

Recently, I enjoy making original maps- there is less “pressure” to get everything right and appeal to players’ nostalgia of classic maps. So I suppose my question(s) is/are this:

*Should I tackle remaking another Legacy Map? Should I make an original? Should I make another Hybrid

And while we’re on the subject (just to help me plan out ideas) *what are some of your favorite art sets?* I am trying to not add new assets

To the best of my understanding

I personally believe that we as a community need to bring their attention to this issue as a more urgent matter.  The health of public games is a matter of critical importance to the future of the game.  And right now public games kind of suck.  Not all the time.  Sometimes they are great...but more often they are over in 8-10 minutes and end in a 5-0 run.

So let's talk about matchmaking and offer suggestions so that we can not only tell HiRez that we want matchmaking

Here are some of my suggestions:

1) Base matchmaking on ping

2) Enforce level caps on servers more strictly. Letting a high level player join with a friend on a lowbie server is fine...but there's no reason to let 5 level 20+s in there.   The game should really try to keep people within level ranges.  That won't always be practical

3) Look at players' relevant stats.  Try to slot in players who prefer different classes.  Don't put in 5 SENs and 5 INFs.  Look for people with offensive and defensive accolades.  This will never be 100% accurate since many players switch around a lot


4) How do we feel about matchmaking choosing teams as well as servers?  I think if all the maps were mirrored it would be a non-issue.

Throw out your ideas.


Edit: Here are some of the ideas from other posters:

5) Slot players into a server with closest average rank to their own

6) Create a permanent public server list that people can join and form a community around.

7) More voting options for things like team mixing, etc..",,False,self,t5_2rdsl,1340061851.0,DSTA,

I'll be adding stuff to this guide as I think of shit

I like lists and bullet points


**How not to be so fucking awful at Tribes**

* **USE YOUR BRAIN, after every death you should think 'where could I have been standing to not get dumpstered so hard.'

* (When HoFing) Stay on the stand; however

* After breaking line of sight try not to approach from the same vector - If someone disappears behind a hill, just on the other side if you go behind it. 

* Don't get into a straight DPS battle (don't jet at someone with chaingun while they're in the air or any situation where you're garaunted to take damage to give damage) if you have lower HP than your opponent.  If you get chunked in the beginning of a duel/on teh flag stand run away and press F.  Use your burst weapons when weak - Shoot your spinfusor/thumper/plasma/burst weapon, inv station, etc) as the weapon cycles then pop out when it's ready to shoot. 

* In adadada do not go left right left right left right.  You want to mix it up - left, left again, very long strafe right, short left etc.  You want to vary the lengths of your strafes.  Strafe for longer when fighting at far range. Don't strafe an inch to the left and an inch to the right, allowing your opponent to just aim in the middle and hit you with everything.  You must make longer strafes if you're in heavy.

* I constantly switch between strafe aiming and strafe dodging in adadada.  Strafe aiming is where you barely/don't move your mouse and aim with WASD.  I'll strafe aim until they hit a good burst then I'll go back to randomly strafing.

* When trying to get the last few shots on distance target

* You're not Reteris or Nullify.  Don't go for mid airs unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.  Reliable damage &gt; scrubby mid airs.  Take your time when aiming burst weapons - when I pull out my disk in an soldier adadadada I'll stop moving completely and momentarily pause to aim.  

* Save some bullets in your mag to chain opponent post ground pound - in adadada SLD duel I will shoot roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of my mag then switch to spinfusor to ground pound.  Your opponent will either jet away from disk and you can get ez pz 100% chain while he's in the air or he'll eat your disk and get knocked up into the air and you'll get ezpz chain.

* Keeping track of your opponent's ability to groundpound you is v important in dueling

* If you have to jet to reposition yourself while getting raped by chain (think lava arena - you fell down to the second level outer ringer while someone is on top inner ring) start jetting when they have just a few bullets left in mag - hopefully they won't get a bead on you for very long before they have to reload and hope you land before they finish reloading.

* Pineapples are god.  Pineapples have inheritance, you get knocked off main structure on walled in, throw nades at the edge so they can't peak down and rape you).  People can't count - try to save one nade for the end of a duel when they don't expect it.  If your opponent is keeping track of how many nades you have (like he should) he will be forced to play under the constant threat of the nade teh entire time.  I recomemnding rebinding yoour nade key you can press while pressing WASD and/or shoot.  You don't want a delay between holding m1 to shoot and tossing the nade, nor do you want to interrupt your adadadad/movement at all when throwing nade.  I use control.

* Your guns automatically reload if they're put away for 3 seconds.  Abuse this.  Throwing nades for 3 seconds does not count.  Don't get nervous and switch too soon, missing the passive will.  

* Guns reload faster than their animation.  Try to cut the animation when posible (Press R

* If there are players you need to keep track of and easily distinguish in game (cappers, add them to friends (and hope they add you) and remove the other players.  Their IFFs will be orange.  I'll do this to enemy cappers and my cappers.  It's nice to see if the enemy cap is midfield or something without having to read the name. 

* Rapidily press your zoom when spotting for cap.  If you spam it for a sec

* In comp, etc) and have the HoF use his inv for on stand blocking.  It's much easier for a HoF to keep their INF up and they have a better view at the exact angle of past routes. 

* If you land right as you're being hit w/ an explosive

* If you're getting knocked off teh flag stand and having trouble getting back up as HoF/LD/whatever, understand on xfire).  

* In stand offs while a raider jammer, slightly above and behind flag carrier.

* As HoF, or into my soldier reach if they have my flag.  Reach doubles the range of flag grab.

* Use extended mortar on jug hof so you can 1 hit full health (1400hp) soldiers.

* Jug hand disks have infinite flight time - use it to spam from far away (I like to kill offensive INVs from stand).

* Mortars sometime stick to shrikes - if you're not doing anything else

* When trying to hand a flag off to a teammate, you're not esports.  This one will make me rage if you screw this up in a pug (F you hapster).  

* Hud elements take up a stupid amount of graphics horse power.  You can get a 30% boost by turning off all the HUD elements. I normally turn off everything I don't need, visor bars, visor damage, game messages, etc.

* Protip on beating me in a duel - I almost always strafe left once or twice before going for the ground pound in an adada (bad habit from when I only had F to switch weapons).  No one has ever exploited this properly.

* Shoot the flag into you

* You can bait ground pounds by landing on someone momentarily then falling off it.

TWL has been home to Tribes ladders in NA since the dawn of time

But it's be real here: TWL is a mess. There are a ton of dead teams on the ladder that have never been removed. Challenges can go unanswered for months while the teams dick around doing nothing. The rung system ignores match history and relative results with similarly skilled teams for determining ranks

GameShrine has a much more sophisticated ranking system, and has a lot of other cool features that make it easier for teams to find matches and scrims (such as GameShrine Play). As a caster, I also find their stats tracking intriguing, making it easy for me to pull stats on each team and map, which makes for great content and helps tell the story of the match.

Technologically

Moving to GameShrine would also have the effect of uniting the competitive scene under one site

As long as NA can maintain independent self-government over its ruleset, NA?

My main question would be if we could just port current rankings over, but at least seed it with TWL rankings to begin with. I guess that's up to Lumberjack.

Issue 1: Hi-Rez.

But a less crappy answer...

Hi-Rez tried to modernise the game and its mechanics... and failed.  Most of the changes were made to make it ""more CoD friendly"" (their words.)  They didn't realise what they were doing.

1. Health Regen.  Tribes is a game of converting health into speed.  With the addition of health regen, the longer your route, the faster you can go.  The defense do not get this additional time to generate speed, so it breaks the dynamic.  It means that larger maps, like Temple Ruins, just don't work, because cappers *have* to spend more time generating speed, further breaking the dynamic.  On a side note

2. Movement Physics.  Somebody coined the phrase, it is very hard to start moving.  Not only is this incredibly unfun, but it's hard to catch up to those pesky fast cappers, who not only have more time to convert into speed, but have an easy job of staying fast.  This lead to the need for ligthweight, rage, etc.  This is compounded by the terrible self-impulse.  This is the reverse of previous games where it was extremely easy to get moving

3. Perks.  To quote Mabel: ""I don't see what needs to be said about it, regen, and damage/impulse ratios (which nitrons flagrantly ignore). The perks in the game are all terrible flat +stats, they're just lazy 'content' that add no real options (well, more like selectively partition options you had in previous games), which just breaks the game at every turn.""

4. Class system.  Hi-Rez chose to arbitrarily create a class system where each class had a static loadout with fewer weapons per loadout than previous games, etc.  They improved it to the current system, but it's still woefully terrible in comparison.  Not allowing players to make their own loadouts has lead to a number of issues, mostly balance. Something the restricted classes was meant to avoid.

5. Weapon Mechanics.  The weapon mechanics essential served to pigeon-hole every single class into a certain limited number of roles.  2 weapons meant that classes were not as versatile as previous games

6. Teamwork Aids.  The lack of implementation of key teamwork aids meant that public play was severely restricted.  The *command circuit* from previous games, the waypoint system also allowed players mark incoming enemies or each other.  For instance, previously, saying ""take the flag from me"" would add a big glowing waypoint on that player, so everyone could easily see exactly where the person was needing assistance.  Hi-Rez added the spotting system instead, which was, and is, instead of using it to alert team mates of where players actually are.

7. Maps.  The maps were small, rather than hills, because the physics didn't allow anything else.  That and the removal of fog (because u can't have fog in games these days, right?) meant that snipers became a massive problem.  Maps needed line of sight blockers to help with that, but didn't really have any.  The maps are also awash with imbalances, such a Katabatic (a non-mirrored map,) Arx Novena (non-mirrored spawns) or Drydock (non-mirrored map with non-mirrored rocks.)  When older Tribes mechanics (such as core spawns) were introduced, though.  Kate

8. Performance.  One of the key things these days, the performance of the game is so poor that not many people could stream or record themselves.  If they could, the quality of said streams would be poor because the graphics were turned way down.  Not many videos appeared on youtube (compared with other games,) either.  Originally, the game didn't have any well optimized 'low' settings, and if you wanted good performance, you had to hack through inis to turn off settings.  This was a massive barrier for entry to anyone with a non-ninja system.  Additionally, my fps increased by over 30%.

9. Demo Recording.  There just isn't any.  Hi-Rez broke demo playback in alpha and never went back to fix it.  Not only is this a key feature from previous titles in the franchise, one of the few ways that high-quality videos can be made.  It's also harder to make good montages/videos, because you can't go back and get shots from multiple angles.  It also doesn't allow casters to ""post-cast"" a game.  Demo recording is just such a key feature of a game, it was a blow when it was ""taken off the roadmap"" because a dev looked into it and said it was a ""blackhole of developer time.""

10. User Generated Content.  Hi-Rez decided to go with the *walled garden* approach for T:A.  This meant they had complete control over what exactly went into the game.  There was no UGC.  No custom maps, etc.  They claimed this is because of the F2P nature of the game.  Previous tribes games thrived in custom mods and maps.  As a small company with limited resources, they should have *made as much use of the community as they can*. A mapper for tribes once said, ""A good tribes map is more accident than intention.""  There were thousands of high quality maps made for previous titles.  Only a small subsection of them got played.  Why?  Because they were very hard to get right.  Very few people ever mastered the art.  Hi-Rez decided, in their infinite wisdom, to limit the map making to a few experienced udk mappers with *no tribes experience*, *no understanding of the game* and *no idea about competitive fps map making*.  The end result? See above. Not to mention, Hi-Rez answers

11. Servers.  Hi-Rez decided to, but not much better.  Not only were the servers themselves bad, but the organisation of them was bad, too.  Bad tiering (1-10, 9-50?) meant that as soon as people got out of the nooby zone, they were destroyed and stopped playing.  The management of the servers is also awful.  Full of bugs and bad design choices.  Let's consider the flag bounce bug, for instance.  Changing the physics setting on your custom server makes the flag bounce wildly.  You cannot undo it.  Once you've changed the setting, because Hi-Rez has dropped the game.  On top of this, you cannot transfer gold to that new account...  And you can only have 8 maps on the server

12. New Player Support.  There wasn't any.  End of story.  Game designed to get cod players

13. Bugs.  Initially in alpha and beta

14. Community Feedback.  While they listened to some

15. Vehicles.  Grav cycle, not tactical options.  They promote skill-less spam play, instead of being considered, skillful options.

16. Call-Ins.  Do I really have to say anything on this?

17. Spectator Mode.  Poorly implemented from the get go.  More bad design decisions, you follow it with the camera.  If you're following a flag, you're following a play, not the flag itself.  When the flag is capped or returned, you want to continue watching that play unfold, not zoom across the map.  And if you do want to zoom across the map, you can press f+lmb.  And let's not forget the bugs

Things new to the franchise which would have been cool:

1. Matchmaking / Ranked.  Some sort of ladder or mmr rating.  And everything that goes with it.  Team/pug queuing

There are little things in the game that bug me. Not bugs, despite the game's relative age and seeming maturity. It's the little details that can make an experience truly worthwhile, stuff that can show the dev team is paying attention to their game and wants it to succeed. I don't know if they care as much about this game as their other/upcoming titles anymore, but as they continue to keep the game alive, I think a little tidying up is in order.

**1. Menu.** It's a hassle to navigate even for someone who uses it often. It doesn't have to be flashy: it only has to make sense. There's a tree structure going on behind the scenes that's mostly hidden from view

**2. Loading Screen.** I don't think it's too much to ask to have a different screenshot for each map being loaded. They're not all Drydock, and we're set.

**3. Killed by ""Weapon"".** This happens when you run into someone who's using Super Heavy. You could just as easily say I died to a Body Block, just say something different than Weapon.

**4. ""V Destroyed"".** On the scoreboard, it refers to killing base assets, turrets, force fields, etc. Maybe you could say ""Deployables Destroyed"", or ""Assets Destroyed"". That's not too many letters, right?

**5. Match time.** There's a space on said scoreboard for the Match Time and Match Number. During beta, it's been over a year into the game's actual, released lifespan, and neither does such a system exist nor does any functioning use for that piece of the scoreboard. Either make use of it or hide it: please don't leave erroneous text implying something you don't offer.

**6. Console chat.** Again, forcing me to use the abomination that is the console display. Heaven forbid I forget to turn it off before a map switch, or it's stuck on the screen during the map load.

**7. JK.** The default key for the friends list is J. The default for killing oneself is K, but you don't have to nearly kill yourself when you think about them. Conversely, if I want to ""K out"", as they say, I would rather not accidentally pull up that list when my finger slips and waste those precious seconds (especially for a game that intends to be ""FAST!"", seconds count). Sure, I could change the setting, in turn

**8. Tutorials.** Ok, the other you *exclusively* control. One should get back to the drawing board on those tutorials and show some of the skills we've developed over the years, including skills we learned in *past* games like disc jumping. As it stands, the only way a new player will learn anything is by getting their head out of the clouds and listen to the community, which is a tough thing to ask without plastering it all over the interface. (By the way, I recommend creating some artificial lag in the Target Practice to simulate a real playing experience. Not much, just a ping of 50. Maybe then

**9. Gameplay Announcements.** Knowing the flag was dropped is cool. Knowing some arse on the other team is on a killing streak during a CTF match is useless to me. Let me specify which messages I see

Have I missed anything? Am I nuts for wanting a little attention to detail?

1351019562.0,11ym3u,A Tribes Story: I Am Soldier,MurderousGent,73,20,28,"A Tribes Story: I Am Soldier
============================

""Reliable. Versatile. Solid."" As Soldier took off his helmet
Lord of The Wilderzone

Soldier ruffled his greying hair with a gloved right hand, along with the lies of Highers, that had made Soldier commit the unforgivable sin just some twenty six minutes earlier...

""HEAVY HOSTILE, fear, curiosity...but mainly helplessness. Soldier silently prayed to The Flag On High (which only that morning he had sworn to defend) that it would be Brute, awkwardly trying to ski over the hill before succumbing to a quick-drawing Thumper/Gast combo. But even then one well placed Devastating Spinfusor disc would leave Soldier crippled,and having equipped an extra nade wasn't going to change that.

Soldier stared at the brow of the hill. TWo seconds. Three seconds. It must be Brute

Soldier jetted up and to his right
before the heavy had time to engage. If only. Jug emerged from behind the hill
tried to midair strafe. If only Soldier could land, and connected with a direct hit to Jug's face. ""I can do this!"" Soldier thought, as he quick-drew his Gast ready for his imminent landing, and the inevitable jet into the air from Jug. Soldier landed, started to strafe, and Jug lifted into the air. ""Got ya you son of a bitch!"" continued Soldier's inner monologue.

The X1 bullets started to miss. ""Reliable. Versatile. Solid"" Highers' words rang in Soldier's mind as he prepared to mirror Jug's movement and send him back to the arms of the Flag Creator. The X1 fire stopped for less than a second

Soldier shuddered, Soldier said aloud. Fuck. He watched the countdown on the headset display, and tried to rouse what was left of his spirit. Four, three, two, one.

Soldier jumped off his tower and started skiing with a new fire in his eyes. ""I'm coming for you Jug"". He jetted up a hill and landed on top of
his ship. Through gritted teeth he whispered, ""I'll retrieve our flag!"" He may have lost the duel, but this was the time for Soldier to shine! His headset display marked the flag carrier immediately; it was Path, and he was getting away. Fast.

With the scars of battle on his face, he pictured his glorious moment; a well timed Prox into the back of Path and, with his weak armour, he would surely fall. The Holy Flag would, in turn, fall nearby, and Soldier would use his Skin to instantly teleport it back to base. Soldier the hero. As he reached the foot of the hill in front of him, nothing of pain. Maybe one day that could be said of Soldier.

Jetpack engaged
Soldier. As he looked through the sunlight he was struggling to spot Path

There was barely time for Soldier to whisper the Forgiveness Shazbot before he heard it; ""I'm ten seconds out!"" It was Finder. And Soldier was nearly at the enemy base. He may have lost the duel

Soldier steeled himself
Thumper to the face! Tech jumped. The rat-a-tat of the Gast only lasted a couple of seconds before Tech slumped to the ground. ""This is what Soldier was born to do."" ""Five seconds!"" said Finder. Soldier threw a Prox up to the shrine holding the enemy Flag On High

Soldier gritted his teeth. Then instantly another ping of pain. And another. And another. Soldier looked up;the Flag guardian, but he knew it was over. Bringer's cannon ripped Soldier to shreds in seconds. Soldier's body lost all feeling and began falling from the sky. With his last ounce of energy, Soldier opened his left eye and saw Finder flying in at great speed. ""Maybe I did enough,"" he thought, ""Maybe we can capture the infidel's Flag. Maybe you were born to do this"". Soldier's eye began to shut, just as Finder's body exploded around a Titan missile.

Four, one. Soldier awoke again. But this time he just stood there. The comms were raging, but Soldier couldn't even hear them. It
was a stalemate right now

Soldier looked to his right thigh, sat there. Then, with the
right hand that had killed hundreds, forsaking the oath he had taken to defend the Flag On High. Soldier said aloud,""Reliable. Versatile. Solid...fuck you."" He pressed the button. Everything went dark...

So as Soldier stood there, and broken spirit, he cursed Highers. ""I wish I mattered to you, but I don't. I fight for my honour, and for your profit, but you don't care. You think I want praise? To be called 'Hero'? No. I am not 'Hero'. I am Soldier.""

Tomorrow (Friday), but there will be separate channels for the new folks. Zero experience with pugging or comp play is fine, and in fact anyone that has much experience playing pugs or comp will be asked to join the regular pugs. The goal is for first timers to not feel overwhelmed or outclassed.

Comp players will ""coach"" the teams that are formed

The only thing that is required is a microphone of some sort and a good attitude. Euros are welcome too if you don't mind the hours.

I just want to remind everyone why we play pugs, we continue to ostracize them and make them feel like pieces of dirt in the PUGs.

The whole idea of a PUG is a bridge to the competitive scene.  It's a place where even experienced players learn, you WILL play with a mix of players who are practically legends and others who are just starting out.  

And if the good players come out and want to play a PUG like it's the last game of their lives, I wouldn't stick around.  We are too mean and too competitive, even in casual play. And for god's sake don't offend the new players! I was appalled with what I heard in comms today!  

In short, and then laugh about it. Certainly not often, but enough to remind people to take a break from the seriousness. 

On the other side of things

TL;DR: PUGs should be enjoyed, and finish the match.  No moaning and groaning.

Automatic reload:  When you run out of bullets while holding the trigger down.

Active reload: When you press 'r' while there are bullets in the magazine.  The important part here is that, then you advance the shell.  BUT, if you don't run the gun out all the way, there is still one left in the chamber, so you skip the advance-the-shell part of it, meaning your reload is about 40% faster. 

Passive reload:  When a weapon is deselected for more than 3 seconds

&gt;The big things we are focusing on for the next few weeks are:

&gt;* 1) Stability and performance
* 2) Fix annoying issues and bugs such as deadstops
* 3) Private servers
* 4) Improved social/friends features
* 5) New and better maps

Thankfully with the new patch this became twice as easy now that they actually tell you your base xp and so I was able to derive the formula to calculate xp based on the data I collected and the hints given by HiRez.  I present to you what I am 95% sure is the formula to determine your xp for a round:



    Base XP = time_played*0.55
    Bonus XP = (Base XP)*(win_bonus+0.25/rank)


time_played is simply the amount of time you were playing in seconds (not 100% sure whether it takes afk time into account)

win_bonus is 0.25 (25%) if you win the round

rank is your rank on the leaderboard for your team (so if you get top of your team you get a 25% bonus

1347856405.0,100asd,Let's talk D stacking,DukCake,66,16,148,"If my personal experience is representative of a larger trend

It seems to me at least a few factors would explain why defending is favoured:

First of all, depending on the O:D distribution of the teams but as a general rule the following is true: defenders outnumber attackers and defense becomes many versus few (or, indeed one) whereas offense usually results in the reverse.

When player skill goes up, of course.

Second of all, and at least in my experience the frequency of cappers in general. This is both a good and a bad thing: it is bad because games overextend and stagnate and good because previously capping was more of a solo effort whereas now more support and coordination is required of offense for cappers to succeed: to ward off chasers, disrupt sentinels etc.

That may well be the biggest factor at play. Cappers don't bother because they need help they aren't getting. Other offense won't bother without cappers. And the less O there is

The question is, unnerfing nitrons for instance. Both of these are, however, up to HiRez and beyond our direct control (bar keeping the pressure on them by voicing our opinions). 

What we, for sure, but fighting against the odds can also provide for some thrilling fights and is arguably the best way to improve your skill. Let ego or loss aversion not be an obstacle -- there is no shame in dying, only in not giving it your best. 

Any thoughts on the matter and ideas for promoting O are more than welcome.

1346257621.0,z0yfh,Due to request: My ramblings about the infiltrator class,DrakeIddon,77,24,52,"Been a while since i did one of my guides but i recently found [THIS ABOMINATION](http://tribes.wikia.com/wiki/Infiltrator) and it has got my jimmies rustled

The infiltrator is a love-hate class for me

I hate it because:

* Many people assume its something that its not

* Many people get angry because they assume its something that its not

* Many people are playing it to a standard that makes me want to pry out my eyes and throw them at the nearest flag carrier

* Many people overestimate it

* Many people underestimate it

* People (COUGH HiRez COUGH) are still trying to buff many aspects of it that are now bordering on overpowered.

My goal of this post is to give some insight into the infiltrator

**First on the agenda: Weaponry and equipment**

**Primary weapons**

The Rhino SMG's: these things

The Stealthfusor: My favourite primary weapon, Still works outdoors but is much more suited to indoor fighting over the SMG's (not that you should be indoors at all, ill get to that later)

The Jackal: **AHAHAHAHAH JACKALBADS**, it is still by far the most overpowered weapon and is still banned in comp play due to the fact it can still airburst for self propulsion and can knock cappers off route eZ-modo.

Dear jackalbads

**Secondary weapons**

SN7 pistol: The two pistols are (in my eyes) the only choice for a secondary

Arctic SN7: +10 damage per shot over the original pistol in return for -2 ammo per clip ~~This weapon is currently bugged and has drastically lowered rate of fire than it should have~~ This weapon has now had its RoF fixed and is now a viable varient over the SN7

Knives: I honestly dont see the point in these but many argue for it in the case of preference. They have lower RoF and clip than the pistol but do 375 damage and 100 splash (very very small splash radius

**Belt Items**

Stickies: Happy little adhesives with a nasty kick to them

Prism mines: Have you ever played jump-rope? yes? Prism mines are like jumprope with a little twist, this allows you to hide the mine and still cover an entrance or hallway with it.

Smoke grenades: Banned in comp due to a number of reasons

**Perks**

**Slot 1**

Close combat: After the (retarded and unneeded) buff to CC's backstab bonus 2 patches ago

This perk is the bread and butter attack for infiltrators that run LO but opt not to use sticky nades and will instantly kill any light or medium class apart from the following 2 exceptions:

* The target is also running CC and therefore has a 60% damage reduction from melee

* The target is a raider with an active shield pack with about ~60% of his energy available

Reach: Allows you to more easily return the flag

Stealthy: After its buff 2 patches ago, rendering them basically useless unless you accidentally walk into it.

Looter: as with all classes

Safety Third: Probably the best choice when used with XL stickies as it turns thier retardedly xbox huge radius into an even more retardedly xbox huge radius

Bounty Hunter: Easy kills is easy money, are boring as fuck to use, require zero kill and you should feel bad for even thinking of using them.

Ultra cap I: If you are new to the game and are not confident about energy management then you can use this is you want to

**Perk 2**

Sonic ""motherfucking"" punch: With this perk your melees will be followed up by a hadouken that will force the enemy flag carrier to drop the flag (although it tells them that they have dropped the flag

Survivalist: One of the most used perks in the game and for good reason

Ultra capacitor II: like ultra cap I, just get survivalist and master it, it doesnt take long and you will be better off.

Mechanic: This is more of a fun way to annoy and kill tanks than actually being viable. Grab this


**Usage and Melee**

As an inf

Now my cloaky companions

PSA to all people who think the inf is an indoors class, plz goback2CoD where camping and using auto-aim is considered skill**

As LO, HoF's, bullets, mines, walls and base turret shots as he can. Imagine that he is one of those high-maintanence lemmings from the hit 19**'s game that have literally no concept of self-preservation and you must do literally everything that you possibly can to ensure he doesn't die.

1334889555.0,siyou,The Brute is under rated.  This is my guide on this class.,trisk,76,21,90,"**Brute**

[70+ hour, the Brute can be the best dueler, and to that end, they can be a generous asset to their team.  The more enemies there are fighting the Brute and being dead, the fewer enemies there are to cap and chase.  The Brutes are a decent compromise of mobility and resilience, and their role is really one of fighting enemy players directly, and helping their teammates indirectly.  Dueling is the focus I will take with this guide, but pack a serious punch.

**Weapons and Abilities**

* Heavy Spinfusor – The classic Spinfusor, so practice with other classes' Spinfusors will still be useful for the Brute. 

* Automatic Shotgun – Initial secondary hitscan weapon.  It has a great rate of fire and fantastic damage

* Nova Colt – Xp/Gold cost secondary hitscan weapon.  Good aim will make short work of lights at 190 to 123 damage per hit.  While not as effective as the Shotgun against heavies

* Fractal Grenade – The initial ""disconade"" is basically an area denial tool that spits out approximately 15 lasers that do 410 damage per hit.  Practially useless for dueling

* ""Light"" Sticky Grenade – Xp/Gold cost sticky grenade.  Direct splash does 1000 damage to a large area all the way down to 350 damage at the edge of effectiveness.  This grenade will not explode until it has touched any surface for approximately two seconds.  It will promptly adhere to that surface including enemy armor.  This is why it is the only useful dueling grenade that is available to the Brute, outright killing light armors, and causing subtantial damage to medium and heavy armor.  As a side bonus, it does large amount of additional damage to base assets and vehicles.

* Energy Pack – Truly

* Shield Pack – A difficult pack to master for those used to mobility, a wizard with the Shield Pack could be a god of Arena and C&amp;H.

* Potential Energy – Another must for mobility

* Survivalist - Thanks for the mention, a steady stream of bodies begets a steady stream of bodies.

* Super Heavy – Necessary to play as HoF

* Safety Third – Two grenades just doesn't seem like enough.

* Looter – Solves the same problem Safety Third does by increasing pickups instead of initial number.

* Mobility – The Brute is surprisingly mobile.  The energy pack makes it the most mobile heavy class.  Skiing will get you going at speeds that don't compare to Pathfinders

**Game Modes**

* Capture the Flag – Arguably the Brute's weakest mode,"" but make no mistake, a Brute causing a serious ruckus at the enemy base will be a most welcome distraction for the capper.  The Brute also can be played defensively to great effect as HoF due to the flag stand denial offered by their Disconades.

* Arena – The Brute does well in Arena due to their surprising mobility with the E-Pack and Potential Energy.  Easily absorbing the inevitable damage while dodging most other hits.  The Brute's weapons pack a serious punch to the lighter

* Capture and Hold – Easily the mode where Brutes are most common

**Matchups**

Brutes are pretty effective at dueling almost every class

* Doombringer with Chaingun – This is your Rock Paper Scissors matchup.  At almost any range, but this is difficult, especially with the increasing stress of the hail of bullets whittling 100 damage a pop.  Staying on the ground near cover is your best bet for avoiding the maelstrom, taking the Colt pot shots you can, and taking the Spinfusor shot as it opens.  Prepare to lose against this guy often.  It is certainly not an imbalance issue, it is simply the most effective matchup against the Brute.

* Juggernaught with LMG – See Doombringer with Chaingun

* Technician – Their SMG is generally more difficult to deal with than their Thumper

Thanks for reading guys.  Let us please stop claiming the Brute is useless

####Current Impulse Jumping Balance for Pathfinders

| |Self Damage (HP)|Impulse (units unknown)|Self Impulse Multiple|Self Impulse|Impulse per Health|AOE Radius|""Hitbox""|Amount Carried|
|:-------|:---------------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:--:|
|**Impact Nitron**|300|54
|**Explosive Nitron**|650|110
|**Compact Nitron** |300|30
|**Light Spinfusor** |550|85
|**Dueling/ Blinks Spinfusor** |550|85
|**Bolt Launcher**|650|85
|**Light Twinfusor**|380|85

The table above shows what most of us have already concluded: Compact Nitrons are terrible for impulse jumps compared to the other options

####Current Impulse Jumping Meta
|Role| Perk 1 | Perk 2 |Combo|Health Remaining|Total Impulse
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Disc + Impact|50|268
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Explosive|250|264
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|Bolt + 2x Impact|300|231
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Disc|350|204
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Bolt|250|204
|Cap|Any|Ego|2x Explosive|56|264
|Cap|Any|Ego|Disc + Explosive|120|240
|Cap|Any|Ego|Disc + 2x Impact|152|231

Listing Compact Nitrons for any of these combinations is futile

To clarify the perks, so these impulse values will make you go faster, and Lightweight (50% weight) may also be used. Since I don't know the relationship between these impulse values and speed, I can't take that into account.

I would not bring this whole discussion to the table if I didn't have a suggestion in mind. I propose that nerfing the Compact Nitron's damage appropriately, players gain the advantage of carrying an extra flag dropper. To provide the balance required, I think that the speed gained by using Compact Nitrons in combination with other tools should be still be less than the speed gained from using the Impact or Explosive Nitrons.

I believe that magic number for damage is 225.

With the new damage

Efficient combinations are listed below.

####Modified Compact Nitron Combos
|Role| Perk 1 | Perk 2 |Combo|Health Remaining|Total Impulse
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Bolt + Compact|25|240
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|2x Disc + Compact|125|240
|Chase|Rage|Not Ego|Bolt/Disc + 3x Compact|225|210
|Cap|Any|Ego|2x Disc + Compact|40|240
|Cap|Any|Ego|Disc + 3x Compact|105|210
|Cap|Any|Ego|4x Compact|316|144
|Cap|Safety Third|Ego|5x Compact|170|180

This table makes it seem that running the modified Compact Nitron would be viable

**Why 225?**

If the Compact Nitrons dealt 200, and is thus avoided.

If the Compact Nitrons dealt 250 damage, but is extremely fragile, just like with the Disc + Impact Nitron combo. The Disc + Impact combo would still achieve greater speeds with slightly greater health, balancing out the killing power the Bolt Launcher affords.

**Why even make a change?**

Yes, on the Doombringer, the Mine vs Frag/Defective Frag balance is absolutely horrible. Given the chance, every HOF will run mines. All of the items in this game need to be balanced to the point where it's difficult to distinguish which is better. A beautiful example is the Thumper DX vs Spare Spinfusor balance. Both are very powerful and have appropriate advantages situtionally. We as the fan base need to work with Hi-Rez to acheive this balance throughout the game.
