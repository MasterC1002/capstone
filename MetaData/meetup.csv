But the draconian Entertainment Industry Lobbyist written ""Anti-piracy"" law that includes due process lacking three strikes bans from the internet, like the ones you need to protect your online banking, Is back in congressional hearings on Wed Dec 21st 2011 at 9:00am

Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) and the congressional entertainment industry shills who helped sponsor the SOPA act were able to manipulate the congressional hearing status for continued study and investigation of SOPA; originally set for mid January 2012

Not even the budget reform bill has gotten this type of unprecedented fast tracking. They are trying to pass this no matter what 90% of the population says or does and no matter what the network engineers of Google, and hundreds of others warn them.

This will repressively damage the security and function of the internet if SOPA is passed. The fear of the loss of the freedom of speech and rise of state sponsored corrupt corporate mandated censorship is the first steps to fascism and big brother.

This if passed could ban reddit, twitter, and more because it made the Entertainment industry mad that day. It could even stop people from voicing issues against the government and government contractors who do illegal things.

Take a Stand people. Join me on the December 21st 2011 at 7:am on the steps of the US Capitol and then on to the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill if you can and help me protest this.

**""NO ON SOPA - H.R.3261"" ಠ_ಠ**

**Be on the steps of the US Capitol (38.889825

**Wednesday - December 21st

If you are not in the area in another state or US ex-pat please start calling your congressmen and senators. Let them know you will not stand for this act if it passes and their will be hell to pay come election day or sooner if knowledge of the corruption comes to light.

I've been cruising Meetup.com for months now -- I can find groups with similar interests to me (Books, buuuut... these groups don't really intersect.

If I attend the 20s party girls groups I'm afraid I won't have anything in common with the girls there.

The point of all this rambling is, and are in a similar age group. It would be so cool if the site could match people who are similar to you, and say like, ""Hey, Girl X also likes Skyrim! Here's a meetup in your area that you could both attend! And here's a link to message this person and introduce yourself!"" So, basically a dating site, but for friends. At least you could feel like you are showing up to these meetups with a ""buddy"".

If you are holding a seat and find out you can no longer go

I will be speaking with a project manager later in the week to nail down specifics.  Once that is done, I will use bcc on the distribution so we don't all get swept up in an email storm.

I also created a new subreddit for this: [PhillyBus](http://www.reddit.com/r/phillybus).  Since the bus is now full

** Update 9/24/2010 **
Thanks to everyone promoting this; the seats are slowly but surely filling up.  I am going on a camping trip with /r/motorcycles to WV this weekend, the seats oversell over the weekend, I'll issue seats in the order they were purchased and give refunds to the rest.  Have a great weekend, everyone.

I'm signing the contracts for the bus today and putting down the deposit.  *Please* help me get this bus full.

I finally came up with my sign.  The caption will say ""Illegal Aliens are Taking Over America!"" and the picture will be a reddit alien smoking a blunt.

** Update 9/22/2010 **

The Center City pickup will be at Market &amp; 30th.  The pickup will be whenever the bus can get there from KoP.  If anyone would like to volunteer to be a Center City representative to stay in touch with my on that day

Found out today that the bus has a TV.  What should we bring to watch?  

** Update: 9/21/2010 **

I just did some calling around and have decided to hire US Coachways.  They seem like a very professional and dependable company with good prices.  Based on everyone's feedback, and do two pickups.  Here's the details:

* 6:00 AM pickup in King of Prussia.
* Secondary pickup in Philadelphia
* We should arrive in DC at around 9:00 and we will be dropped off near the National Mall
* We will depart DC at 6:00 that evening.  There is a Federal law that a driver cannot be on duty for more than 15 hours
* The bus is a luxury liner with high-backed tilting seats, and heating / AC.
* Total capacity is 56 seats.
* Total price to me is $1490.
* I will be asking $27 / head for a seat.  If you reserve a seat and later need to cancel

I have not yet put a deposit on this or signed the contract
If you want to get in

If you would like to get a seat, a stranger, with your money.  Let me just say that I have been on Reddit for (almost) two years, and I'll be using PayPal to collect funds which will offer you some small degree of consumer protection.

My personal email address is Tom@.net.  Remove the word ""REDDIT"" for the proper address.  This is the best way to contact me.

As seats are reserved

Oh

Firstly I'd like to say that what we have launched today is (hopefully) only the beginning.  I hope to make many changes based on feedback from the reddit community.  Please try this out for all of your reddit meetup needs and give me feedback by PM or via email to support@redditgifts.com.  I will listen to all feedback and probably implement most of it

**Here's a short introduction to reddit meetups:**

[meetup front page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/) - You can start your search for meetups here

[meetup page in map view](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/?show=map) - a handy map view of all meetups in your search criteria.

[subreddit meetup page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/r/twincitiessocial/) - we will add the ability to subscribe to these soon.

[special day pages](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/day/global-reddit-meetup-day-2010/?show=map) - we tend to do a lot of things here on reddit on special days.  This year we are having [Global Reddit Meetup Day](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/day/global-reddit-meetup-day-2010/?show=map) on June 25th, it takes about 1 minute for me.  If this is something the reddit community would like to do itself, let me know and I'll expose it to everyone.

**Your meetup tracker** - If you're logged in to redditgifts at the top right you'll see ""your: meetups""

**Emails** - We will send emails to remind of the meetup 1 day before the event to anyone who has clicked the ""Count me In!"" button.

**Photos** - Anyone can add photos to a meetup and they will appear in a slideshow format.

Again, I want to make it special for reddit.",,False,,t5_2qn4t,False,,

I'm an American expat in Amsteram, and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/97c88/bill_oreilly_vs_amsterdam_round_3_bill_responds/)) I've noticed that there's quite a few more Amsterdam redditors out there than I thought.

I proposed a meetup

As it stands at least 15 people responded that they might be able to come on the 8th, we'll probably be running another meetup in Sept (if all goes well).

With this in mind it would be a good idea to bring grills, lawn chairs and whatever else you would bring to a day at the beach.

I don't usually tend to share my ""life's story"" with people

* Dad's a pastor (I'm religiously ambiguous for now)

* Moved around often in my life - broke connections

* Came to B.C.

* Drugs/Drinking ensued

* Drug/Drinking related friends appeared

* 2.5 years later

* Got new friends

* Got a girlfriend and fell in ""love"". Disassociated with new friends

* Broke up ~6 months later. Friend-connections were shaky.

* Graduated highschool, so I'm not in College/University.)

* Denied needing friends for a while (6 months) and spent time working and studying to complete goals.

* Realized that I'm a lonely bugger!

* Posted on Reddit.

If anyone's interested in hooking up or just bumping e-mails around

Feel free to send me a message.

**UPDATE 3**  ~~I want to make a reservation but I need a head count.  If you DEFINITELY plan on coming, let's just meet there anyway.  Show up when you want, but I'll be there around 10:30-11:00.  

**UPDATE 4**  SteveOccupations PMed me and plans to arrive between 8:30 and 9.  He will bring a sign and try to grab a large table.

It looks like we're gonna have quite a turnout!  I'm getting excited!

Side note: Who would downvote a meetup thread???

1281550236.0,d00yr,Copenhagen Meet-up: August 28th! Mark your calendar! :),redditor929,29,2,59,"**[New updated post with a detailed plan](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/d2n7f/copenhagen_meetup_we_have_a_plan_now_august_28th/)**


As determined by the voting in the [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/cxseh/copenhagen_denmark_meetup/)

The location has yet to be decided... my main question is if we should risk an outdoor meeting place or if it needs to be somewhere inside in case of rain. I'm thinking we could meet in some public place where we could hang out for bit and give people a chance to show up casually, but I can wear something specific so people can recognise me... not anything weird though. 

Anyway, here's mine:

1. Nyhavn - We meet at the the start of Nyhavn in that [slightly scummy little square](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Nyhavn,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.160552,75.761719&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Nyhavn&amp;hnear=Nyhavn,+1051,+Copenhagen,+Denmark&amp;ll=55.680601,12.587521&amp;spn=0.000691, we usually get some fancy beers from Magasin and then go hang out across from the expensive cafes... like a classy bums or backpackers. :) But

2. Some pub - Like [Lord Nelson's](http://www.lordnelson.dk/) or [The Globe](http://www.the-globe.dk/). The most obvious thing to do... and better if it happens to be raining. (Sigh. Do I hate to have to think about that in August.)

3. Fælledparken - Someone suggested this in another post and this may be the best plan if it looks like a lot of people will turn up. Only problem with this is that I don't know where in Fælledparken to meet. Maybe someone could Google map a suggestion.

4. [YOUR BRIGHT IDEA HERE]

So

Come on Danish reddit (including you lurkers)... we can pull our shit together to do this can't we? It's not that big of deal and has the potential to be really cool. 


EDIT: As much as I hate Facebook

EDIT 2: It seems like Fælledparken is most popular... in good weather. If it's raining too much then we need a Plan B. I haven't really had any great ideas. The only pub that would work for a large group is The Dubliner. So

EDIT 3: It looks like the rainy day plan will be go to Temple Bar. I will make a new post with the meet-up details in a couple days.

EDIT 4: Make sure you are subscribed to r/meetup or r/denmark so you'll see the post with the final plan",,t5_2qn4t,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/d00yr/copenhagen_meetup_august_28th_mark_your_calendar/

EDIT - READ THIS:

It sounds like there is some good interest in this.  My group was planning on pregaming at a friends house or at the bars early in the morning and then stepping off to the actual event.

Given the amount of responses I think it'd be better to pregame in a bar somewhere (or somebody's place if they don't mind opening it up).

My idea for the day was - Pregame with kegs n eggs type deal early in the morning (0800 or so) and then take public transport to the docks for the 'tag.

I think if we could get enough people and get a keg and a backyard we'd have a fucking blast.

I know I've got a crew that wants to come so if we all crew up and find a good place to do this that would be ideal.

Sorry it is such late notice everyone! This is hosted by myself and my boyfriend

3/28 happens to be Something on a Stick day (Think corn dogs, etc) , so that's going to be our theme since random holidays are amusing.

We've got a nice backyard with an outdoor kitchen, it's just you might miss out on some stuff/food. The party will last till 10pm, since it's a work day the next day etc. and we don't want to keep people up too late.

As for the potluck portion, etc.

**Please PM me if you plan on coming and what you plan on bringing

A list of suggestions:

* Ice 

* Drinks 

* Corn dogs 

* Shishkabobs (or ingredients for them) 

* Popsicles 

* Lollipops 

* Snacks you might eat with toothpicks... 

* Pretzel sticks 

* Red vines

....and anything else stick like or not that you might wanna bring :) We won't be picky. It's just preferred that the food is tasty. Please let me know though so we don't have 10 people bringing ice.

If you really can't bring anything foodwise or afford to pay

Thanks everyone! Hope everybody can make it. I'll try to update this with the count and what's being brought.

EDIT: Here's who is coming so far and what they're bringing. I'll update this more when I get more confirmations.

**Yes:**

fishfishfish - popsicles/ice-cream on a stick

barbehque, shish kabob stuff, maybe beer

bananabelle - Pastries... on a stick!

anonamous - a 12 pack or ice

asev0 - red vines and other candy

misterFR33ZE and 2 friends - beer and maybe chips

ap0rnnstar - beer and some sort of substantial food

KillYourTV - wine

thedarkhaze - cocktail meatballs

**Maybe:**

Matriak


**Looks like we're set for sweet stuff. If you're still wondering what to bring.... what we still need: ... maybe some side dish type things? .... or alternatively money to run out and get stuff we don't have.**

Biddle(Redditor who is helping with all of this)will see if we can't set up a Reddit drink special there. They have a pool table in the back and plenty of seating and are generally very cool cats. Several of the cast members will likely end up there

I've been told that Reddit snips will be peppered throughout the show and the cast/crew of the show are all thrilled!!

Let me know if you have any questions.

I would also like a head count. In the comments or PM me - Just let me know if you are in or not!! Thanks guys!!! Let's have a blast!!

This definitely started off as a ""singles"" night and has developed into something more than that. Trivia night and other meetups will be ""singles"" based. However, forgot to think about the environment. Well...I've thought. haha. So **ALL** enjoy. And I hope to see as many Redditors as possible supporting the Arts. =)

[Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=143990182288605) - now up to 26 members!

Here's the plan(s)...

**Weather - cross your fingers!**

There are two plans, we will go with the outdoor plan. On a warm day, I'd still rather sit under grey skies than under a roof. I hope the rest of you feel the same. Since the weather can vary a lot... *I'll update this post in the morning of the day of the event, so you can always check back here to be sure.* But if you can't... Unless it seems obviously wrong, I'll go by the [DMI forecast for KBH/Nordsjælland](http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/danmark/regionaludsigten/kbhnsj.htm). 


**Outdoor plan: Fælledparken**

Meeting place: Entrance near Trianglen at the Genforeningsmonument statue. [Google maps location](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=F%C3%A6lledparken,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.572881,63.457031&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=F%C3%A6lledparken&amp;hnear=F%C3%A6lledparken&amp;ll=55.699161,12.574869&amp;spn=0.000729,0.001937&amp;t=h&amp;z=19) *Note:* This is NOT the main entrance on Øster Allé. This is the corner of Øster Allé and Blegdamsvej.

Activity: Bring your own beer/whatever. Bring something to sit on if you like. If someone wants to bring a frisbee or something else activity-related that would be cool. 


**Indoor plan: Temple Bar**

After much consideration, but to make meeting up easier we will start out downstairs. 
[Google maps location](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=N%C3%B8rrebrogade+48,12.556476&amp;sspn=0.000364,0.000904&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=N%C3%B8rrebrogade+48,+2200,+K%C3%B8benhavn,+Denmark&amp;ll=55.68953,12.556605&amp;spn=0.000364, but here's a [pic of the outside on this page](http://mitkbh.dk/temple-bar/)


**How to find me/us**

I don't have a reddit t-shirt, which is not all that common and should make me stand out. 

**If you want to show up much later than 14:00**

PM me and I'll give you my phone number

**I'm proposing two meet ups, the 12th, from 3:30pm - 4:00pm both at console freeplay**

*Why console freeplay?* - for those of you who haven't been to PAX

I feel like it's a good spot since it's easy to break the ice with a game. It's not as easy as breaking the ice with alcohol

*Why 3:30pm to 4:00pm?* - I figure most people are going to be at the convention during the middle of the day. Why not just meet up when we have the most people there?

*Why meet at the convention as opposed to a bar?* - I'm not a Boston local so I don't really know of many bars surrounding the BCEC, please, please *suggest one*. 

**Edit 1:** It looks like another meet up thread has popped up on /r/gaming and picked up some steam. You can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fy367/pax_east_reddit_meetup/). 
 
**Edit 2:**We're still on for Friday at 4:30pm in Console Freeplay. Be there! I'll wave you guys down. If you need to contact me asking my whereabout just send me a message and I'll give you my number. 

**Edit 3:** So a few of us met up on Friday at 4:30, really sorry. There will be another meet up tomorrow at **1:00pm at the handheld lounge**. See you guys there. If we can get a few people involved we'll *try* and shoot for 4:30pm on Saturday as well. I don't have internet access while at the BCEC.  Again, I'm really sorry if we missed you. It was really fun to meet the few of you I met today!

So they were originally going to take the bus up, and will thusly be able to arrive a little bit earlier. So post here/PM me if you're up for that or you have fun things in mind.

If you're interested in running them around at some point during Sunday or whatnot, post here or PM me and we can set something up.

Brats &amp; bacon will most definitely be on the agenda. Probably concurrently.


**Items currently on the agenda**

**Saturday Night**

* Power Hour at the Nitty (10-11p). They should be arriving on time for that.
* A boot at the Essen Haus. This has to happen.
* For the non-bar crowd--a short visit to a house party?
* Fishbowl at Wandos?

**Sunday**

* Brunch at Mickie's Dairy Bar at 9:30-10a. Depends on the hangover.
* Small grillout at my place--mostly to feed them the bacon-wrapped brats that they missed from the previous day's tailgating.
* Hang out at Genna's and/or Great Dane for some beer-tasting?

Looks like the general consensus is that we meet at [Ashley's](http://www.ashleys.com/) in Ann Arbor. Anyone have a preference to a time? 

[arcsin suggests that we have the meetup June 12](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/bu9s1/metro_detroit_meetup_on_global_reddit_meetup_day/c0oled8) due to Ashley's probability of being packed the 19th because of Ashley's Lobsterfest.

I know there was that recent thread on snowboarding

Every time a socal meetup is brought up

My idea? I prefer Dave &amp; Busters myself. It's got booze, but I don't know what would be better for redditors.

I'd like to note that I'm horrible at organizing social events. I just wanted to bring this up to provide an open forum to see if people are still game for a socal meetup

We've been talking about a 12/12/09 meetup date. Early enough so people won't have finals or holiday travel plans yet.

So far some murmurs have been going on in the conversation here.

The suggestions have been:

Kennedy's in Russian Hill
Jillian's at the Metreon in SOMA
Sweeties in North Beach

I've also heard good things about Zeitgeist in the Mission.

Vore bra om vi vet några dagar i förväg vilken film vi ska se och hur många vi är så vi kan reservera platser. 

In case there's someone who doesn't speak swedish who's interested: I've got a free ticket to the cinema that expires the 24 and I've got no one to go with. So basically I'm asking reddit for company. The plan is to meet at Filmstaden in Lund the 20th and go see a movie (suggestions?) and then afterwards go drink a few beers somewhere. Sounds good ey?

Edit: eftersom Iron Sky har premiär den 18e så tycker jag att det skulle vara passande att se den (annars är det risk att folk redan har sett filmen) så jag bestämmer helt enkelt att det blir den. Om inte beslutet möts av massiva protester förstås. Sen vore det bra om folk meddelade senast 12.00 på onsdag om de kommer så jag kan reservera platser. Skriv alltså bara antingen som en kommentar här eller skicka ett meddelande till mig så jag vet.

So I'm coming to [Austin for SXSW](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b3orv/a_bit_of_a_long_shot_but_are_there_any_austin/) and want to host something of a meet-up in the city. The festival runs 17-21 March

I don't know the city, or at least in one that cards (Yay being eighteen), and considering the response I got with the /r/Askreddit post it will probably have to be somewhere that can handle a large group.
